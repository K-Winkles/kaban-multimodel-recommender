Make sure you pay attention so the holes on the sides line up correctly, we figured that out 3 pieces in - the instructions are just pictures. Took about 20 mins to built with two adults. Looks great and fits in the corner of my daughter's small room. Fits all her books, she loves it! Good deal, purchased during Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale for $48. I would say I think it definitely is worth $70, but glad I got it cheaper!!!",

I just laid out all the parts and made sure they were there, then put them together as shown in the instructions. It took me less than 20 minutes to assemble. As this is a taller unit, i would advise using the safety straps to anchor it more securely against a wall for the safety of children and animals who may accidentally cause it to fall over. I, myself, did not do this as i have placed it in a corner of my bedroom in a way such that it is away from foot traffic and is positioned with other furniture in a way it cannot topple over.I really do love the unique, space-saving look and feel of this book case.Highly recoomend this unit and the seller.",

                "reviewText": "Assembling this shelf shortened my lifespan by five days. It's very pretty, and it's sturdy, but the assembly instructions SUCK! The instructions are in pictographs, which I struggled to decipher. I ended up having to disassemble it a total of seven times because parts of it were backwards. Once I got to the very last piece, I realized that the whole thing was backwards so the closing brackets were in the front. But I was done and there was NOTHING that could get me to disassemble it.I need it to sit in front of the window in my daughter's room so I couldn't attach it to the wall (I couldn't anyway because the backing is on the front) and so it leans menacingly. I put a handful of books and papers underneath to stop it from falling over until I can get an appropriate wedge at the hardware store (assuming one exists).The product is great, the instructions are rubbish, and you REALLY need to attach it to the wall.4/5",

They were pretty easy to put together as long as you pay attention. I put one board on wrong and didn't realize it until the end. Luckily, I didn't have to take the whole thing apart to fix just that one board.I left the bottom floor piece off of one of these because I wanted to hang it on the wall. I do not recommend doing that if you just have sheetrock. I have a solid wood wall behind my sheetrock, so I just drove three-inch screws through the back board of the bookcase (once I put the books on the shelf, you couldn't see the screws).The other shelf I did put the bottom floor piece on as it will stay on the floor. The only issue I had was attaching the Phillips screws to the bottom plate. One of the screws went in fine, but the other did not. I tried to angle it but it barely worked. However, even without that one screw firmly in place where it should be, it seems very sturdy and should last a long time. Overall, I'm very happy with them and suggest them if you want something a little outside the norm of a normal bookcase.",

We accidently had one board turned the wrong way and decided not to go back and fix it since we had put the whole thing together already...
