Instructions were better than most put together items I have purchased. When putting together the back boards, slow down to make sure you have it in the right direction. I had to take it apart and redo a part when I got to step 8 or 9 and realized the holes for the screws were in a different location because I put the piece a few steps before together on the flip side. It still was a quick fix. It is sturdy. It looks great. It's not big and overwhelming.",

This bookshelf was perfect. It takes up very little room but holds a good number of books. It is really cute too. It was easy to put together. Everything was included in the box and the directions were very clear! I got the charcoal gray because it matches my room. I am very happy with the book shelf!",

Height-wise, I\u2019m just shy of 5\u20194\u201d and it comes up to about my underbust. We did not do the wall anchor thing, and it is a *tad* wobbly at times even with heavier books at the bottom. But still decently sturdy & good quality, especially for the price.This took my husband about an hour to assemble, but said once got the pattern it made sense. His critique is that the instructions weren\u2019t as clear as he prefers and there were a lot of extra parts, so it was a little confusing. But he also didn\u2019t want to watch the reviewer assembly tips video, sooo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
