                "reviewText": "This was the best looking small shelf/drawer unit I could find. It is heavier than expected, so quite sturdy. The drawers are a little small, but if they were bigger the unit would be bigger, negating its nice size. The directions were all drawings, but easily understood. Mine had no scratches. It had one itty-bitty gouge, the size of a flea, which was easily covered with a black marker (a great idea by a previous poster.) All parts were there except for one screw, which I found a replacement. (So close!) It did have one small place in the back where the laminate/veneer was coming up so I just glued it. It took three hours to assemble, but I purposely took my time. I laid out the hardware in its very handy numerical order (#10 was missing its sticker. #1 and #10 look exactly the same. Don\u2019t mix them up, they are not interchangeable!) and looked over the directions for about ten minutes, which helped immensely. I made notes in the directions indicating which side was the top, bottom, etc. There were a few times I thought holes were not drilled but then realized I had a piece upside down or just not aligned. This is why I went slowly! :) When assembling, do not tighten the screws until all the shelves and drawer box are attached. Then finish tightening before you lift the shelves up. Do not over tighten. The only thing that I would change is I wish these shelves were offered in an oak color.",

                "reviewText": "These are nicely designed and easily assembled. The components look nice but there are some things to be aware of. Everything still looks nice, but take care during assembly so you don't mess up parts. Below was my experience assembling. Hope this helps you.Make sure you hit the dowels in all the way if you're gluing them. (Glue is included and in instructions.) If you don't pound them all the way down, and glue them in, the glue will bind them quickly and when you assemble the box for the drawers, you'll smack it down with your hand and the wood will crack where the dowels were too high.The screw nuts that go into the holes, can bend and strip. Just be mindful in your torquing of them with the screw driver. Also, it's easy to mix up the two different sized mounting nuts. Notice the difference between the 9mm and the 12mm and get them into the right holes. Getting them out or trying to mount them with a cordless screwdriver could cause you some grief so pay attention to that. (I bent one of them and put the wrong size into a hole by accident and it was a little difficult to remove.). But again - nothing major, just take care.The finish on the wood will scuff if you look at it wrong. It is too thin of paint. Maybe have a marker ready. I will likely have to repaint these at some point.The drawers work great. Easy, smooth, and they look nice. The whole shelf looks very ncie and is a great addition for what I need. Yes - I'd recommend these shelves. Hope that helps.",

The bottom should have been the top (see pic), which caused the drawer rollers to be wrong as well. The holes are in the wrong pieces.I have put together tons of these kinds of pieces & this was by far the most aggravating. The pieces were all scuffed up & needed a black sharpie to camouflage the marks. Took way too long to finish & if I wasn\u2019t so frustrated I would have taken it apart & boxed it back up!!
