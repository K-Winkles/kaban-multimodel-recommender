                "reviewText": "I have similar shelves to this one but that exact model was unavailable so I went with the closest alternative. This unit is decent- very easy and quick to assemble even by one person but the quality is less than fantastic. While tightening one of the screws that secure the shelf to the frame, one of the frame tube walls caved in slightly; nothing catastrophic but still undesirable. The frame itself is thinner metal than my old unit and the shelves are supported only by the screws that pass through the frame and into the side of the particle board shelf. My old unit had a metal bar front and back where the shelf screwed down onto those bars. I wouldn't trust these shelves to hold a great deal of weight but since I don't intend to use them as bookshelves they should be adequate. Overall, this unit looks good, is reasonably stable, and while cheaply made, should fulfill its intended purpose without too much trouble. If you are of smaller stature and/or have limited strength, this may be ideal for you as it is light weight and easy to handle during assembly.",
