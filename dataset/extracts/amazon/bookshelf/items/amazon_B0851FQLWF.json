The bookshelf itself is beautiful and very sturdy. It comes with a wall mount but Im not using it and it still feels so sturdy on the carpet. Perfect amount of space for my books and a few little decorations/plants. It was packaged safely and arrived fully intact. I nicked it with my knife when trying to get off the stickers but it didn't look so horrible and i was able to mostly buff it out, i probably should have been more careful anyways! I really am satisfied and its such a beautiful addition to my room!",

Liked the fact there were mostly screws holding this together, and not a ton of cam locks. We managed to assemble both shelves in about 1.5 hours, and are pleased with the arrangement and sizes of the different shelves; for all the various nick nacks the mother in law has to put on them.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy this shelf because so many reviews said how bad the instructions were and how hard it was to put it together. If that's holding you back, go ahead and buy it because it's a cool looking piece that isn't THAT hard to assemble.It took me an hour or so to put it together, but I never got confused or frustrated. The worst part is that there's 40 alan screws that you have to put in with a tiny alan wrench -- so the assembly is tedious. Just grab a beer and throw something light onto the tv while you do it. My advice would be to pay attention to the instruction manual. There arent any words and you'll want to make sure your pieces match the orientation of the pieces in the manual or else the screw holes won't match up right.I really like the shelf and am considering buying a 2nd one.",
