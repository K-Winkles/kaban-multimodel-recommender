                "reviewText": "1. I LOVE IT.2. Whoever designed this got it slightly wrong in all ways for building.--the shelves all bow up at the center because the length of the vertical pieces is slightly off.--I had a damaged foot screw and no extras. I had to hammer it after I placed it, so good luck ever taking it off.--the back brace pieces are just on the side of too short to be attached by the screws, which led me to stripping a screw (I had ONE extra) and not being able to get two screws in all the way. Also they're gold while everything else is black or silver. Annoying.--the instructions are VAGUE. I read them and examined them before I started and still managed to do and redo the same piece 4x until I was mad. For your reference, the shelves should have the hangover lip in the center while the edges should be flush when put together. Screw the edges in on both sides before you do the center with the brackets. Save yourself a headache.--the fancy x in the center of the shelf will look great, but good luck screwing in your pieces. There's everything in the way, and it is annoying to do mini half turns over and over again. It can be done.--I appreciated the clear labeling of every piece!--I did have to anchor the shelf for stability, and the pieces were provided for that.It is a gorgeous piece, it holds everything I want and has edge hooks!! I can hang my bag and jacket on the side to grab on my way out or keys, umbrella, head band, winter gear, whatever. I didn't know that feature was on the shelf, so it was a good added surprise at the end.",

It says two people for a reason, and as soon as my son helped, it was quick and easy to assemble. My first shelf came with a very small error in manufacturing, but the company took care of it right away, and I was able to get a whole new shelf. Amazing experience! Great customer service! Everything about this was just wonderful, and I look forward to filling my shelf with more joyful items.",

It took a few hours for 2 of us to assemble but it wasn't difficult at all. Once it was finished and assembled, I absolutely love it! It's very sturdy. I left out a few shelves because I used it for my plants and some were too tall to fit. If you're on the fence, I would say buy it and you won't be disappointed. It's a very lovely piece. It looks exactly like the picture. I'm glad I bought it.",
