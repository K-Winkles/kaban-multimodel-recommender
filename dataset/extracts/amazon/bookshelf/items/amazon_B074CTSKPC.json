I left off the bottom shelf and backing because I thought it looked nicer that way.Assembly wasn't too bad. I would recommend using a drill to screw the shelves to the sides. I used a screwdriver, it took some time and force to get them all the way in.They give you stickers to cover the screw holes. If you follow the \"wood grain\" they blend in very well and you really can't tell.The shelf itself feels pretty sturdy. My record player is at least 15 lbs plus all my records it's holding a decent amount of weight. My cats have jumped all over it without incident.Overall I'm happy with it! If you need something small, sturdy, decent looking, and inexpensive this is the perfect shelf!",

                "reviewText": "Hi! Definitely annoyed beyond belief that they market this product as a TV stand when it\u2019s barely 12 inches from the ground. Had my father-in-law not put this together without my knowledge, I would\u2019ve returned it immediately. Pleaseeeee don\u2019t make the same mistake that I did! (The old TV stand is in the right of the photo for reference - and it\u2019s a decent height) It also looks like it\u2019s from the dollar store. Hoping this will help someone!",

This shelf is not very sturdy, but if you put it on a flat surface it should be fine. I have it against the wall to make sure nothing tips it over. Overall, I am very happy with this shelf. It was not only a reasonable price, but it has a nice presentation and was able to hold everything I needed.",
