Was sad there was no other reviews of the grey, mostly white shelves people had reviewed. So here is a photo of it and I hope it helps anyone else that may be curious about it. Outside of that, I was initially concerned because the box it came in didn't say the brand name of the company it says you're purchasing it from. However, it's definitely the shelf advertised, not sure what's up with that. As far as everything else, this shelf seems very sturdy and has the capability to SO many books. I had been struggling to find a shelf that would fit all of my kids books and this actually had some room to spare the way that I organized them. Despite my gripes, would purchase another just better to know the color and if it will go with decor you're trying to go for.",

A few of the metal fasteners it came with broke in half because I guess I tightened them too much. All that said, it is holding together ok and it's still functional. You may want to add some additional screws. It does come with white stickers to cover any screw holes.",
