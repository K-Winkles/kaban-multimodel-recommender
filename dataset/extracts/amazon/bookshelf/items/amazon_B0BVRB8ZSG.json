All pieces were numbered, directions easy to understand, and it was only one person (me) to put it together. Lay everything out, pay attention to the holes in the pictures compared to the holes in your pieces\u2026 easy\u2026 had it all together and upright within 30 minutes. I do love the look, it holds a lot of books, and with my gliding chair at an angle in a pretty full room, I only had the small space to work with. This is stable, I don\u2019t feel the need to secure it to the wall at all. 4 stars vs 5 is purely technical because there were a couple of places where the seams of the bars weren\u2019t perfectly closed, but no one other than me would notice. Overall I\u2019m very happy.",

And it was worth the wait and I promised I would come back with a review (:For reference I\u2019m a very handy female and I was able to put this together by myself effortlessly.I decided to work smarter this second time around and just swap the 36 hex screws for traditional screws of the same size so I can use my small drill. Needless to say I had this together in 30 minutes flat (including time to peel off the pesky stickers)This is super simple to put together and will be a great addition to my library. It looks just like the picture and will be sturdy enough to hold many books!Thank you so much!",

I was not prepared for how heavy this bookshelf was when I picked up its delivery box off my porch! I was pleased with this fact however as it suggested to me that it would be sturdy and wouldn't tip. Upon assembly, I found these presumptions to be correct. I did not have any trouble assembling it. The instructions were clear and concise. The company lists six points of contact to reach them if I had needed to reach out though. That was nice to see. The bookshelf came well packaged so each of the pieces all came in pristine condition. I have purchased other items where this wasn't the case so I appreciate the perfect packaging job. I styled the bookshelf by stacking my books in a herringbone pattern and used the top of the bookshelf to display a plant. For the individual looking to bring an aestetically pleasing, functional piece of furniture into your space, I recommend this awesome bookshelf.",

                "reviewText": "The product looks great, exactly as pictured, stands up well on its own, no wobbling, and a nice flat wooden panel on top. If you put your heaviest books towards the bottom, you will have an extremely stable sturdy and compact bookshelf!I knocked it down one star because the assembly takes a long time, around an hour and a half, and my shipment was missing one of the hex keys. If you want to make sure you can assemble this yourself at home, you will need at least: one 3mm hex key, two 4mm hex keys. My package contained three 4mm hex keys, so for most people that would make it impossible to put together. Fortunately, I had a 3mm hex key adapter for my ratchet, which is the way to go for this assembly anyways because there are NEARLY 50 SCREWS and power tools are probably not going to fit between the shelves during assembly. I don't recommend that anyone try to put this together using the stupid little 3mm hex key anyways, even if it came in your box. Photos include the tools I used including three 4mm hex keys (of which one is redundant/unnecessary), as well as the ratchet and front page of the (very clear) instructions.Recommendation for manufacturer: you need to include the 3mm hex key, but ideally scrap the key in favor of a screwdriver with a 3mm hex head. I can't imagine actually doing this install with a 3mm hex key, it would probably take 2-3 hours and leave you with an aching wrist/forearm.",
