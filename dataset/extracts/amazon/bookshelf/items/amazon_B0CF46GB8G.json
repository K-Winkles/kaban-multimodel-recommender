I most likely won't order this product again. I was bummed it was cloth and plastic, the seams are fragile and tear easy. The cover is like a shower curtain, like why?",

Turns out I\u2019m too broke to get a really good shelf but I found this and bought it.It\u2019s not the sturdiest thing in the world, but it\u2019s versatile, easy to assemble, cheap and hey it gets the job done. I have filled it top to bottom with decently heavy books and it\u2019s holding up fine, and I am very satisfied with it. If you\u2019re looking for something to look pretty or hold something extra heavy, we\u2019ll keep looking but this is very practical, functional, and affordable. For the price\u2026 5 stars!",

When you assemble, make sure the rods are all the way in -- a small hammer with light to moderate force will help. Don't hammer the rods (they are plastic) out of shape. This honestly is a GREAT value with the price and surprisingly good quality. I finally find something inexpensive and not heavy to store all my new books -- suggestion to put your heaviest books on the bottom shelves and this thing will be as sturdy as wooden bookcases at half the price.",
