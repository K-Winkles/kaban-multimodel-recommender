The only downside is that the materials quality is only average. When nailing nails into the backing material, it's easy to split the fiberboard or mar the very thin veneer. There are also imperfections in the veneer that look like cracks sometimes. Not heirloom quality but a good sturdy bookcase that anyone can put together.",

The directions definitely need rewritten and illustrated better. Perhaps stickers to indicate which is top and bottom.

I had a real space problem with a small bedroom where every sq. inch has to be juggled around to make the room navigable. What I wanted was a good-looking (antique?) bookcase to sit against a wall where I had a maximum of 13 inches depth allowed. I looked all over the place, found nothing. Most bookcases are more like 17 inches deep. When I came across the Sonoma Bookcase and saw the 13 inch depth listed in Description, I knew this was really close to what I wanted. But what about its stye? Hey, it features little distinctive design features like the convex kicker and the framed sides and top piece.It was silly simple to assemble! It is really pleasing to the eye.Delivered in two days.I recommend this piece. I got the bookcase in \"Espresso\" - the darkest colour.",

The cams were drilled to far in so that the screw things could not attach. I could not put this bookcase together. STAY AWAY from this company. I could not return this piece of junk so in the end i took to the cottage and burned it as firewood. At least it had some purpose. Expensive piece of firewood though.",
