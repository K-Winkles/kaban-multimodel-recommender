I doubt they ever sent it in the first placeI am unable to complete assembly of this unit because one of the pieces of the foot base was sent to me is totally mis-manufactured. As you can see in the photos, the holes where screws need to be inserted were punched in the wrong place, and I can't even put a screw through the hole because another piece of metal is blocking the opening.I called customer service about this and after waiting on hold, they told me they couldn't complete a part order over the phone and I needed to send an email. I sent all of the required information only to have to re-send it again. Now they are saying it will take up to two weeks to receive the new part, but the original shipment of the unit only took 4-5 days.Cross your fingers you get a correctly manufactured unit when you order from this company.",

I am hoping this translates to sturdier than expected shelving. I did almost kill myself trying to get the boxes into my home. Building them is not too difficult but I do recommend two people be on hand. There were minor dings and defects on some of the parts but they would have needed to be far more extensive for me to consider repackaging this for a return",
