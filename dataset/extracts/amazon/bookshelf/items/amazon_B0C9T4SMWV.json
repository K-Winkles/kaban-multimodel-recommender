It was very easy to build by one person. Seems sturdy. And looks great! No issues assembling with mismatched holes or anything and the turning component works as it should. Definitely worth the money! I will be getting another one as it didnt fit all my books. I would say depending on size it will fit about 200. Also the shelf parts are pretty narrow in length so if you have a longer book besides a normal hardback/paperback, it will stick out awkwardly. Its about 5 feet tall as well.",

                "reviewText": "I have a pretty small space, so this is a perfect fit. The materials are quality wood and metal and even with it loaded with books (to it's limit, not over it), it spins well and easily. I put it together by myself in less than 30 minutes. It is easy to move when empty. I recommend assembling it close to where you want it to \"live\" because it is very heavy once it is loaded with books. Great piece, great price, very glad I bought it!",

I\u2019m a 69 year old female and I could assemble this by myself until it was almost complete, then I needed help only because it is so heavy. Very nice piece exactly as described",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The product came very well packaged. I carefully examined the shelves while unpacking and there weren\u2019t any scratches or scuffs on the wood. Assembly was pretty straight forward but do pay attention to where the orientation of the tiny holes on the metal sides and make sure not to over tighten the screws so you don\u2019t break through the planks. I only used the provided Allen key and it wasn\u2019t really that difficult. Seems to hold a decent amount, I haven\u2019t filled it up yet so I can\u2019t say how the turning function would be affected by weight of the books once it\u2019s filled. All in all, I am very happy with it.",
