                "reviewText": "This is my second purchase of this cabinet and I couldn't be happier. These have both arrived in great condition and super FAST! No damage and extremely well packed. These are easy to assemble. There is even a video for reference for assembly! It did take two of us to put it together for the first one but my husband put the second one together alone.We really appreciate how easy it is to level the cabinets with easily accessible feet on the inside of the cabinet.The appearance is fantastic and could be used in many places in your home. I am using them in my study but these would also be great in a kitchen. They don't look like generic metal cabinets at all.There is also a lot of storage in the base of this cabinet. I actually take the shelf out and use it on the top and use the bottom as open storage.I highly recommend these cabinets. They are well worth the price and are a great storage addition to your home.",

For some reason my child wants to play with the dog\u2019s water or eat the dog food. I love that the legs have the adjustable feet which makes the cabinet stable. I love the color. The item was shipped in its own box and the item inside is well packed. No damage to the item was noted. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. Very sturdy also. The shelves can hold weight. I moved the 2 gallon water on the second shelf to add some height for the dogs comfort and that shelf is holding the weight well.",

It's extremely easy to assemble, and the panels are easy to put together but you may have a hard time screwing things since they're positioned in an awkward angle. it took me about 30 minutes to assemble on my own. It came out perfect though, exactly what I needed. My only downside was that on the top panel, there was a scratch on the paint :( it's not super noticeable it's pretty small but def annoying. i love it despite.",

                "reviewText": "First off, the box it arrives in is HEAVY. That's not a complaint, just fair warning. Easy to understand and justify the shipping costs on an item like this. With that out of the way, this thing is awesome. All metal construction, even the back. None of that cheap particle board nonsense anywhere on it. This book case is a built to last. What you sacrifice in cutsie design you more than make up for in robust quality. So if you're tired of throwing your money away at Ikea on composite board garbage that buckles under a light breeze, stop doom scrolling Amazon. You've found what you're looking for.Instructions are as simple as they could make them. It's very well designed, comes packed with plenty of protection - parts nested together perfectly. I could tell my box took a beating on the ride over here. Product inside, completely unscathed. *chef's kiss Whoever designed this had the foresight to understand getting at the leveling feet at the bottom is not going to be easy. So they put holes in the bottom shelf to level it from inside the case with a flat head screw driver. No need to try to spin the feet from underneath like you do a washer or dryer. Again, *chef's kissSince it's all sheet metal that means magnets will stick to it. Not a touted as a product feature but one I appreciate none the less because I will certainly be taking advantage of that fact. Arrived in a timely manner. So no complaints there. Assembled the main case minus the doors and shelves in about an hour.They give you a screw driver to assemble it with the small parts, but I recommend using one with a thicker handle so you don't tear up your hands on the one provided like I did.All in all, GREAT product. Grossly under rated and under ranked on Amazon in my opinion.Great work Lissimo! I love it.",
