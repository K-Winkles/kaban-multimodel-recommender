                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the IRONCK Bookshelves and Bookcases Set of 2, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and ease of assembly. This 6-tier, floor-standing bookshelf set is not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly sturdy and reliable.Assembling furniture can often be a daunting task, but this was not the case with the IRONCK bookshelves. The instructions were clear and straightforward, making the assembly process smooth and hassle-free. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I was able to put them together, despite not being particularly handy.The sturdiness of these bookshelves is remarkable. They feel very stable and secure, giving me confidence to display my collection of books and decor items without any worry. The materials used are of high quality, ensuring durability and longevity. This aspect is particularly important to me, as I have had experiences with flimsy bookshelves in the past.Additionally, the design of the shelves is both functional and stylish, fitting seamlessly into my home decor. They offer ample storage space, and the 6-tier design is perfect for organizing books, plants, and other decorative items.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the IRONCK bookshelves.

                "reviewText": "It is a strong and attractive shelf. We needed a slender shelf with narrow shelf depth or an area that wouldn't be blocking a passage way. The thicker closet we replaced made it harder for individuals in wheelchairs to get through to the accessible bathrooms in the non-profit we run.My husband has a chronic habit of dumping everything he doesn't know what to do with, in the middle of our work/cook stations that we can't have cluttered. So this is his 'dump shelf' where he can put things until we figure out where to organize them in our existing storage space. Man has it made a huge difference for us.It came with two shelf sets, and rather nebulous assembly instructions. All of the pieces needed were there with a couple of extras in case of loss. The various pieces are labeled A, B, C etc in the diagram but no labels are on the various pieces, so one does have to pay attention that they have the right part. We had one mishap where the wrong shelf was used but it was easy enough to remove it and replace it with the correct board. So not the best instructions, but still fairly easy to figure out where the pieces go in the assembly processOne thing that was particularly impressive, IMO, is the back boards of the shelves. They are sturdy and slide into tracks in the side and shelf boards. It's not that cheesy paperboard that covers the back of most shelves like this.",

If you have a drill with an Allen wrench screw bit, that won\u2019t be an issue. The directions were pretty easy to follow otherwise. The bookcase is seems very sturdy and looks nice, except adhesive covers for screws should have been included. I bought them separately.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these bookcases and hoping that they would be sturdy enough. Thank goodness they are. After my last bookcase tumbled I was afraid this was going to as well. I worried for nothing, these are made out of wood and the assembly didn't take to long. The instructions were very clear and basically step by step so there was no way you could put it together wrong. I would say that it took less than an hour to put both of them together. I do love the fact that they are 6-tier shelves so you do have more room to put books. With all the added weight added onto them, it is very sturdy. I do like the fact that they give you a wall mount so you can secure it to the wall. That is a big help. Due to having carpet, I found that putting cardboard under adds more protection for the tipping and helping with the last row at the bottom. Unfortunately for me, two bookcases weren't enough so I had to order another one. I did buy the single bookcase from the same place so I know I won't have any issues. If you are a book lover like me, you won't go wrong with using these bookcases for your books.",

The instructions were clear, easy to follow; Assembly was easy (tools needed, included) ; & the shelves look really good assembled. If I am ever in need of a bookshelf again, I would definitely buy this product again!!",
