Beware that the $28 one that stated that it was \u201cunfinished,\u201d did not come with the mounting bracket or wooden slab that you see. I assume that unfinished just means that it was unfinished Wood not that it was partial and just pieces. Once I realize that they actually gave us the option to do our own slacks and made this so much more satisfying. They give us a cheaper option or we can add to the ones that we already have. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Beautiful and unique. I bought the $28 pieces and went to dollar tree to get the slacks, left an inch from the wall for hanging and wrapped it in contact paper. So elegant.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I'm so glad I decided to go with something a little creative for my book display, it came out great! I purchased 4 (so a total of 8 fourteen-inch segments), and I was glad to see that you don't need to connect them with the metal plate, you can do them individually as well. They were easy enough to install, although I did decide to use my own anchors since I was installing on a plaster wall.The one disappointment is that two of the strings broke out of their hangers as soon as I put light pressure on them (the holes were too wide for the knot). I tried tying a bigger knot to hold it in the hole, but then the string ended up much shorter than the others, and the book didn't hang level with the other books.But overall I'm very pleased and love it!",

These are an immense help. I'd love them if I'd gotten a color that I liked.",

So I\u2019m absolutely thrilled that I found these and for such an affordable price they come with just enough to get you started but I\u2019ll tell you what if you are anything like me you will already be planning on buying another one..so just go ahead and buy 2!",
