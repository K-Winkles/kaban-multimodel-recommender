You can get approximately 9 paperbacks on each shelf, depending on the size of the book. Assembly wasn't too bad, but I did have to get a drill to screw in some on the backboard. The holes weren't deep enough. Very happy with it.",

It\u2019s going to go perfect with my living room once it all comes together. It took me a while to put together. I promise I had to take this thing apart at least 5 times bc I kept putting the boards on backwards. Eventually I got it and I love it! This is not even half of my book collection. I wanted to go small for my new place, but I\u2019m ordering another one. Two won\u2019t hurt! It is heavy once books are on there! Beware!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this shelf in mid-2022, and have been using it for almost ~1 year. It is a good looking, polished product. The assembly is slightly tedious-- there are a lot of screws to hand tighten, as others have mentioned-- but nothing unmanageable and the instructions were fine.The main issue is that the primary load-bearing structure of the shelf is a thin & surprisingly flimsy board on the back of the tree structure (against the wall). What's worse-- it isn't even a solid piece all the way up, but rather two halves joined together at the edges by two tiny screws & dowels, half way up the height of the shelf. The result: after ~1 year of use, the shelf wobbles a lot and has developed a significant lean forward of ~4-5 inches at the top (away from the wall). When newly assembled, the top back of the shelf was within 1 inch of the wall. The base of the shelf was never moved, so the ~3-4 inches of lean developed over ~1 year with the weight of the books.From the beginning, the shelf has been only ~50% filled with books, and all the heavier hardcovers are on the bottom 3-4 shelves. The top half of the shelf only has relatively light items & souvenirs. Also, we have always been very careful to push the books all the way back on the shelf (towards to wall), so the weight would be closest to the support. And yet there is still a significant forward lean & wobble. I can't imagine what would happen if the entire shelf was filled with books, from top to bottom!",

                "reviewText": "I assembled this shelf last night for my 8-track tape collection, and it fits the retro vibe I'm going for really well! Love the diagonal/angular look with the woodgrain finish. There's a nostalgic charm factor to it that is hard to really describe correctly.The only issue I really had with it is that because of its design, it actually doesn't hold quite as much as I thought it would. I was able to fit all 82 of my tapes on it, but just barely. Not a big deal, because I'm re-arranging/trying to purge some stuff in my finished basement anyway. The drawer, although small-looking, actually holds a decent number of items comfortably, so that helped alleviate my concern about the capacity.All in all, this is a beautiful, stylish shelf that I would absolutely recommend for anyone looking to add a retro feel to their living space. :)",
