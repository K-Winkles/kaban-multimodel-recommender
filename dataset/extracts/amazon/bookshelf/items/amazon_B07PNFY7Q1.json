                "reviewText": "If you're looking for something that's sturdy, functional, and visually appealing without taking up a bunch of space, this is a versatile option. It's fantastic for small living rooms and entryways where all you have to work with is a corner. It does not wobble or anything when you walk past it. Took all of 20 minutes to put together. Painfully easy to build. My only gripe is the wood-colored stickers that you cover the hardware with after building SUCK. They don't stick well and they're not exactly the same finish. This is a very minor thing, but I'm pretty happy with this product overall. It's structurally sound, the material feels high quality, and it is dumb easy to assemble. Highly recommend!",

The small floor feet were a bit difficult to put in and prone to bending, but they didn't affect the shelf's stability.These shelves are incredibly sturdy and of high quality. They span approximately 83 inches when three are put together, providing ample space for decoration or organization. I can't wait to decorate them!In conclusion, these shelves are a fantastic purchase. Despite a minor issue with the floor feet, they are strong and well-made. If you're looking for reliable, stylish shelves, I highly recommend them.",

It holds all my books and I use the little side shelf spots to put plants.It has to be on very flat hard ground all the way against the wall (no trim) though because it's a bit top heavy and ours has a bit of a lean to it (probably user error). It's on carpet against a wall that has a trim so it doesn't have the wall to stabilize it and it leans away from the wall a bit. We had to put all our heaviest stuff on the bottom and push it towards the back to make it more secure. Just keep that in mind and maybe find a way to secure it to the wall.",

They even throw in a couple of extra pieces of assembly hardware.I would strongly suggest that you attach it to the wall, simply because of the height to depth ratio (not a product flaw, simply based on the measurements).The only gripe I have is that the stickers used to cover up the screws are all one pattern, so they don't always blend in well (not an issue for me, as most of them are covered by books or items). Having light, medium and dark ones to choose from to match the wood would bump my rating up to 6 stars.",

Nothing sags or warps. Seems solid. I plan to \"float\" these on my wall for a unique look but they're fine on the ground too. They do come out of the package with some kind of fiberglass type material on them but another reviewer had mentioned that so I was prepared with some wetipes and it was no issue to get it off before handling. It was the worst on the top board but not too bad on the rest. I will say that the screw caps that came with this are kind of pathetic. They are black, for one thing, which makes them stand out pretty bad on my brown bookshelf. But they are also very shallow so I you happen to sink the screw in a hair too much while assembling, they will not stick. This was easily resolved by purchasing some wood grain colored stickers on Amazon for $5. One package was enough to do both shelves and it looks about as good as it possibly can. I'll include photos of the shelf without any caps on (screws exposed), with the black caps that are provided with the kit and finally with the stickers that I purchased on this site. They are nice, thick stickers that seem durable.Here's the link for them...https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07737SBP9?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit nervous purchasing a bookshelf like this off of Amazon but figured I would give it a shot...this one was a bit less expensive than most other products I had seen in stores/online, had good reviews, and was a decent price in my mind....and I absolutely love it! It's the perfect size and the grey/beige color works well to match most furniture and decor in a room. It definitely took a bit but was relatively straightforward to assemble - no different than a classic Ikea product haha!I used is as my \"nerd shelf\" in a small wall of my family room and it's been a massive hit with anyone whose seen it. My husband and I did anchor it into the wall with the provided accessories to ensure that it doesn't fall by accident, which I do recommend to anyone else considering this product. The size and dimensions are good enough to store most standard books and decor/accessories. I loved the idea of placing 2 of these next to each other to create a wider stacked look and totally would have done it myself had I had the wall space for it! It looks funky and abstract and totally adds a unique look to our house!",

They are exactly what I expected in terms of looks and size, and I am very pleased with the look. They are also very sturdy and easy to assemble. I would recommend these.",
