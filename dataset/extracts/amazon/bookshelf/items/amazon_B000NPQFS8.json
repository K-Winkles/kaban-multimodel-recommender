My eyes aren't the best so having pictures of how to put it together was easier for me than long drawn out explanations. I marked - with my post-its - each piece of wood with its alphabetic letter (from the picture.) I assembled it using the sketches and the funky screwdriver that came in the box and my kitchen table and my wheelchair. I am so proud of myself and applaud the Winsome Juliet company for crafting a wonderful product for the money!",

Both times they came well packaged, were easy to assemble and looked just like the picture - no problems there.Unfortunately, the second one was slightly damaged. The packaging was fine, so I didn't notice until weeks later when I got around to assembling it. It looks like the wood was crushed before it was packaged and shipped. I needed to use it so chose not to return it - just thought I should report the problem here for other buyers to be aware.",

Very easy for 1 person to put together (can be done in 15 min)4. Additional storage on top shelf5. Neutral coloring6. Small footprint7. Very sturdy; does not wobble; is not off balance when fullNot so great:1. Downward slanting shelves won't accommodate books taller than about 10.5 inches upright2. Open back does not allow you to lay anything flat on top of anything upright (will slide off the back)I bought 4 of these bad boys from Amazon. Tops hold photos, a flat panel 26 in tv, 2 lamps, 4 remotes, telephone and PC speakers. Shelves hold DVDs, books, magazines and a large print King James Bible in a zippered cover.",

There were minor imperfections in the alignment that did not affect the final constructed product.The bottom shelf fits books up to 10.5\" tall regardless of width. Because of the topmost shelf, the upper shelf is limited to just under 9\" for wider books (e.g. children's books), but narrower books can be taller. Small books (again, kids' books) can slip and fall down the back if they're very short or light, and shouldn't be set near the sides.",
