Overall easy to assemble, dimensions as described, and color accurate to product photos. The material may not be the sturdiest for heavier items.All of the parts came secure in the box, everything was cushioned by Styrofoam and placed neatly. This also came with everything needed to assemble (all labeled clearly) including a small screwdriver and parts for securing to the wall. As others have mentioned the legs are plastic which might be something to keep in mind if wanting to use for heavier items.The assembly was very easy and the instructions were clear. The legs were slightly more difficult to screw in but still easy enough.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my grandkids room to replace a broken bookcase and a doll house that was way too big for their room. It has worked wonderfully. The only thing I didn\u2019t catch in the other reviews or in the description is that the legs are plastic. I really thought they were wood. But it still is very nice. I love that it is elevated. Makes the floor look less crowded. And can be extra storage. My kids have Barbie cars under it like they are in a garage. But this worked exactly how I thought it would. The little cubbies are different rooms for the Barbie dolls and we use the bottoms ones as book holders. The instructions were easy to follow. It was put together very easily by one person. The child safety that attaches it to the wall works very good. And I feel secure and safe to let my grand kids play with it. When My grandkids came home and saw it they absolutely loved it. Saved a bunch of space in their room!!!! And it\u2019s much more organized!! The color is exactly like the picture was on Amazon! I now want to get another one for my living room. A different color though. Of course it holds much more than in the picture. Kids have been hard at play and making memories.",

                "reviewText": "Taking the price into consideration this is a pretty good bookshelf to buy.Package comes in a fairly compact box and took me about 20 mins for assembly. The main panels are not wood, but have what looks to be a durable wood like vinyl finish. The feet are lightweight molded plastic. Hardware included pretty comprehensive, even includes a basic screwdriver for those that don't have one.When assembled, the bookcase is pretty lightweight and fairly stable side to side. Front to back it does pose a risk of tipping - I recommend some sort of wall anchor if you have kids or if it's going be in an area where it gets bumped.The plastic feet do not have any sort of rubber grip or felt under, and are non adjustable for leveling. May need to use a shim for stability. Do not overtighten the screws for the feet as you'll strip the mounting holes. If I had to point out a weak spot, it would be the feet. Careful with any sort of pressure or force on them other than from top to bottom when moving the unit. Again do not overtighten the screws.The screws that hold the 'wood' panels together are a good length, however they do protrude a tiny bit when tightened down. I did not try to tighten them further to get them flush for fear of stripping them or damaging the panel. It's only a tiny bit but it's there.Once loaded with books and some items, it does gain stability due to the additional weight - be mindful of weight distribution if unanchored, top-heavy will make it more tip prone.It's a handsome piece and for the price a good value. Furniture in general has gotten very expensive. It's not a piece you'll have for decades, but it'll hold up to daily use and some abuse.",

There were two issues that stood out that turned me off from giving this a higher rating: 1. the legs are cheaply designed compared to the rest of the unit. They are wrapped in tape that is printed with a faux wood grain design. This completely cheapens the design. 2. the screws for the legs were missing from the box and when I opted to purchase the screws based on the size mentioned in the instructions, they were too large for the holes. I ended up applying gorilla glue to adhere the legs to the unit. This was inconvenient. In general, it's a nice looking unit.",
