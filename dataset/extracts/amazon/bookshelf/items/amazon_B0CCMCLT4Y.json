                "reviewText": "The height of this shelf is what caught my attention.It\u2019s fairly sturdy and took a long while to set up since each shelf has about 6 screws to it. I like that there is a small \u201cback\u201d for each shelf so items cannot fall behind the shelf. It comes with an attachment to the wall for safety.I think it\u2019s possible for one person to set this up, but was a lot of work even for two people. Especially since I couldn\u2019t find the drill, so we did everything by hand.No surprises here. It looks exactly as described in the photos and description. The instructions were clear to understand.",

I was surprised at how easy it was to build; all the holes lined up and were cut well enough. The shelves are sturdy, and even after loading this towering shelf full of things I'm happy to say it's not budging! Rustic Brown is exactly as advertised and will pair nicely with any farmhouse/rustic themed homes. It's simple and pretty, can't recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a shelf unit for my figures since I left behind 5 Detolfs in my previous apartment. While it doesn't have a glass enclosure it is definitely taller offering 5 shelves to place figures. I have to admit, I ordered this with not too much expectation. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It took me around 20 minutes to assemble and all the shelves are nice and sturdy. My heaviest figure weighs around 9 pounds and I have it on the top shelf. With nothing else in it but that figure the unit never felt as if would tip over. I appreciate that all the shelves have back stops to prevent stuff falling down behind. I'm looking forward to ordering the wider version and another narrow version when I get the chance. It really does look nice and the price is right. Good job, recommended \ud83d\udc4c",

It is very tall and has yet to even hint at tipping--this is while it's still empty. With the open sides, you will definitely need bookends if you do plan on using it as a bookshelf. I will be using it for mostly decor and a couple of books laid flat. Easy and quick to put together with all needed tools included.",
