                "reviewText": "I was so exasperated putting this together I finally asked my movers to do it for me. It still took them about an hour to get it assembled. After all the stress, I still ended up really liking this piece. It is a perfect tower to display my treasures and once assembled is quite sturdy. No tools, screws or hooks, just a small padded plastic hammer that the company provides. To be fair, take my advice....this is NOT a one person job. Things went much better when there were two people.",
