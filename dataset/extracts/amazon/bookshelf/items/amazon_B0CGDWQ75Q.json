                "reviewText": "The shelf is an attractive dark wood color, and is very sturdy. There was a manufacturing defect with mine, such that one of the holes which joins the top and bottom half of the metal frame (and should contain a screw that holds one corner of the middle shelf in place) was misaligned. In the close up photo you can see that the pass through hole is misaligned. The structural integrity of the shelf still seems okay however, as the other attachment points for this middle shelf are strong. This was easy to put together, however the finish on the wood is VERY shiny, and seems to easily pick up smudges from natural skin oils from normal handling.",
