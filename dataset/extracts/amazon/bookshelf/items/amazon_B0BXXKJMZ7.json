                "reviewText": "I opened the box and found what seemed like a gazillion pieces . . .but it was very easy to assemble and i had it done, by myself, in probably 30 minutes. The pieces fit well together, it is VERY lightweight, so moving it into place was a cinch (I( am 78 year old female) I didn't use the wall attachments to avoid holes in the apartment i rent, so i used 3M xl velcro strips and they work like a charm. I am very pleased with this unit. I am using it as a pantry, so some things are heavy, but the unit is solid and shows no sign of failing. Well worth the money!",

I only use this shelf for my Knick knacks to organize my little dorm.",

Fit perfect in my closet that has no shelves and room to use the hangers on the side. Would def recommend if you need something cheap and need storage for decently light weight items. Once you get one row made it's just copy and place.",

No, it is not the sturdiest cubicle storage on the market, but it is sturdy.I do have a small business and just needed a basic storage system to assist with it. This is going to be PERFECT for that, and for what it's worth it is pretty attractive. Should I need more storage, I would definitely buy this again!!!",

                "reviewText": "Im giving a 3 star because of my own lack of research about the product before purchasing. Otherwise itd be 2 star or even 1. It is easy to assemble, HOWEVER, it is a nightmare to keep together once you do have it assembled. Its plastic and very very cheap thin metal rods that give this structure. Although I shouldn't expect a crazy good product out of 40$, Im not sure I trust this thing at all stability wise. If you pull on it too much one way, or maybe even trying to get something big out that may be pushing the walls apart, it can very easily come apart and then its a pain to put back together. You almost have to mount it to the wall if you plan on having anything remotely heavy in it like books or a TV. And even then it comes apart again. Its a great idea but a very poor execution. I think a little more consideration into material and rigidity of the structure may up the price, but Id rather spend a little more than get something Im already considering replacing after just 2 days.",
