Front-facing bookshelves provide a visual display of the book covers, thus encouraging independence and exploration as children are invited to choose books that interest them.

                "reviewText": "First the good:Its beautifulThe quality of the wood is greatIt was packed well with each individual piece wrapped to avoid scratchesEasy to put together but a little time consuming if put together by one person. It would have been a fast build if I had someone to hold the pieces for me while I screwed it in.The bad:Only one real con but its a huge one... the shelves are incredibly shallow so every tile a book is pulled off the shelf and lightly bumps another book they all come toppling over. If you care how your kids space looks you will constantly be putting every book back on the shelf.As much as I love how it looks I will have to send it back as it won't work for our needs.",

Everything looks as though it was meticulously hand picked when designing to make sure the quality of this bookshelf was a priority. Putting it together was easy to follow and quick. We put it in our soon to be nursery and it was the perfect size! It\u2019s heavier and sturdy so I know my baby will be safe when she eventually climbs/uses it to stand up to pick out her books! Love that it promotes independence and options as well. I would love to buy another for my toddler- he loves it as well!",
