It went down hill from there. The pre-drilled holes do not line up!!!!! to allow it to fit together. The holes don't match the construction directions and the drawings don't match the holes in the pieces to be assembled. There are more holes in the boards than needed; so it's full of holes. I would rate it zero stars if I could but I had to fill in something to get started on this review. I haven't mentioned yet that the edges of the shelves and frame unit are chipped.",

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because when I opened my brand new box one of my side pieces had a scratch down it. This was a little disappointing for it being brand new and the price so high. Thankfully it\u2019s on the inside so it can be covered with things. Otherwise, I love it!",
