                "reviewText": "I got this for my bedside table to organize my current reads. You do need to assemble this bookshelf. They include an allen wrench with a handle which was fantastic! They did not include a Philips head screwdriver so you will need one from your own toolbox. It took me 25 minutes to assemble the shelf. Most of the predrilled holes lined up, but the back piece and bottom piece needed slight maneuvering to make sure all the screws got in the right spot. I like the color and the pieces are smooth. The tree looks like three shelves, but it's more like 2 shelves to hold items. I consider it a statement piece rather than a full organizational piece. I'd give this a 3.5 out of 5.",

                "reviewText": "The Tajsoon 3 Tier Tree Bookshelf was delivered as described, meeting my expectations. This is not a large piece of furniture -- its three shelves each will hold a few small books or notepads. This is appropriate for use as an organizer to place on a desktop or another piece of furniture. It is not solid hardwood -- it is plywood or particle board of some sort, but it did not have the typical bad smell of MDF, so it is perfectly fine. The wood grain on the surface is well stained and attractive.The key challenge with this type of purchase always is the assembly process. This one took about 20 minutes. The written instructions were fine, and the pieces lined up and fit together as they were supposed to, which is always a relief. The joints are square, the screw holes lined up with each other (after minimal forcing), etc. -- that's really all you can ask for in a product like this. A special octagonal-head screw driver was included, but you will also need a Phillips head to complete assembly.In conclusion, if you're looking for a Three-tier Tree bookshelf, the Tajsoon seems to be a good option and a reasonable value.",

It looks fantastic and easily holds I few hefty books. However, I would make sure that your desk is sturdy because the shelf itself is a little heavy. It is also very easy to put together. Overall, I am very pleased.",
