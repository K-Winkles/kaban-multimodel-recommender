                "reviewText": "We love that these can be angled as we have some weird walls in our office. Very versatile and really smart construction. It is inherently designed to be more sturdy, especially with a little weight.They were simple to assemble (maybe an hour if on your own), easy to move, and ultra stable.All my previous bookshelves have had issues with the shelves warping under the weight of my book collection. No more! I even broke down my old shelves to extend these a bit higher and they are a champ.During the assembly, my only recommendation is to put the bolt in the center pole a but earlier as once the shelf is all built up. It can be a minor frustration to line everything up easily. All the holes are properly piloted and all hardware is quality metal. Just make sure you follow the instructions.We got magnetic hooks to add lights and hand bookmarks. The metal frame is awesome for this.",

                "reviewText": "It's quite possibly the best bookshelf I've ever bought, the ability to reposition it makes it truly amazing, my only complaint was that the top bolt on the center bar was a huge pain to screw in since it isn't very long and the selves didn't compress enough naturally, after gallons of paint, about a dozen medical books, and anything heavy I could find and finally myself even, i managed to weigh down and compress all the shelves enough otherwise the bolt wouldn't reach the bar through the very top shelf, that bolt should be alittle longer to make it easier to get it into the bar without a huge workout",
