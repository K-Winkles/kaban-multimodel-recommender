                "reviewText": "I purchased the greige tree shelf. It was a time consuming project that requires careful screwing of 43+ screws (!) with the wrench tool it comes with, plus my Phillips head screwdriver--all by hand. Since the shelves are slanted, it took careful handling to screw all of them in tightly without pushing any off balance. I was not expecting that kind of hours-long labor.The greige color is nice, a soft brownish color. I like the sturdy, heavy feel. If it's in a high traffic area or you have young kids, I'd definitely recommend using the wall anchor. Overall, a great value and very interesting display for my book collection!",

                "reviewText": "When I saw this bookcase offered at Amazon, I knew I wanted it in my classroom. I weighed the pros (many) and cons (having to pay for it myself since we pretty pay for everything, students\u2019 supplies, etc.) and the pros won, and I made a few sacrifices and bought it. I am thankful it was on sale, because since we already started last week with a full eeek of Professional Development and this week working on our classrooms to welcome students next week, I am especially busy, so I paid a friend\u2019s son who is between jobs to put it together. It took him less than 30 minutes. First, it is just gorgeous! I created a spot for it (that I only imagined it being there before \ud83d\ude42). I have begun filling it with multicultural books, fiction: story books and realistic & historical fiction ones, and nonfiction: some biographies and historical books, all-in-all some decidable books where kids are to read every word, some leveled books on various levels where kids are encouraged to read at their independent level where they will know most of the words, and then harder books where kids can do different things with the books like looking for their high-frequency words or looking for nonfiction text features and learning along the way. I feel since it\u2019s so beautiful and full of books kids love, students will find it that it is inviting and motivating them to read. Oh, this is a first grade classroom if interested.",
