                "reviewText": "I assembled this alone except that I needed help to stand it up and to move into its position against the wall. It is very sturdy and I liked the fact that it's an open shelf but with the bars at the end of each shelf which helps to keep books upright. It's a simple and sturdy design. I would just say be mindful to follow the exact order for the instructions because otherwise the bars don't line up with the pre-drilled holes.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this is a sturdy shelf system. The individual shelves are pretty weighty, and there's six of them on the unit. I knew my daughter and I would have some trouble sitting the unit upright if we followed the instructions as written, so we altered the assembly order.Instructions as written:1) assemble the three leg sections2) lay the legs on the floor3) attach the top shelf4) loosely attach the cross beams to the back5) attach the 2nd through 6th shelves6) tighten the cross beams7) attach the feet to the bottom8) sit upright and level9) attach to the wall with anti-tip kitInstructions as modified:1) assemble the three leg sections2) lay the legs on the floor3) attach the top shelf4) loosely attach the cross beams to the back5) attach the feet to the bottom6) attach the bottom shelf7) sit upright8) attach shelf 5 and then shelf 49) tighten cross beams on back10) attach shelf three and then shelf 211) level and attach to wallThis allowed us to sit the unit up before it became too heavy to lift. Also, since the top and bottom shelves were in place and squaring up the frame, it made it easy to attach the remaining shelves and get the screws through the frame and into the bottom of the shelves.As others mentioned, assembly took about an hour.",
