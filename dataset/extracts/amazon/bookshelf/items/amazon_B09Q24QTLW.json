Assembly wasn't very difficult, however, the instructions that come with the package can become very confusing. I did have to un-assemble some of the pieces a few times because of them needed to be moved or turned around.Besides the confusing instructions (that also very well could have been operator error)It is a great bookshelf, very sturdy, holds a fair number of books (not adequate for readers looking for large amounts of storage on one shelf).Very cute! I will most likely be purchasing a few other finishes for other rooms in our house!",

Instructions are pictures. You need an electric drill. It does come with a tool, but there are around 40 long screws, to say my wrist hurts is an understatement. It did not come with a phillips screwdriver and you need one for a half dozen phillips screws. The sturdiness is good, but the height is shorter than I thought. It would be really cute for a kid shelf. The shelf comes with wall screw to teether so kids don't pull it on to themselves. Overall only took about an hour of actual assembling, I may have put a few pieces backwards and had to redo. And if I knew where a drill was probably could have cut the time in half. And for being months in a box, the letter stickers came off fairly well although a little more effort went into removing the product label sticker. Overall even with the few blips still a nice shelf for my cookbooks.",

Took about 45 minutes to assemble which included unboxing and watching the video. Then it was a matter of following the pictures in the manual and aligning the pieces correctly. I had to error correct twice but overall it wasn\u2019t difficult. Ensure that you tighten screws halfway and then as evenly as possible especially if they\u2019re on the same piece or in line with each other. For the small triangular piece (E), it was easier for me to attach it to D first because for some reason that piece did not seem as sturdy as the rest and the base of the triangle was disintegrating from the screws. Still worth 5 stars to me.",

                "reviewText": "Before buying, I read a lot of reviews and saw that it was repeatedly mentioned how difficult it was to put together or how unhelpful the instructions were. Having put together many pieces of furniture from boxes previously, I didn't think it could be all that bad. I was very wrong! The instructions are hideously lacking, to the point you have to keep taking pieces off and changing their direction. Because of the different angles of this item, you cannot tell a piece is wrong as you're working with it. The manufacturer needs to change this deficiency. I've never seen instructions so poorly done.I would also strongly encourage the manufacturer to provide matching colored screws for where they will be seen, or to sink them lower and include a plastic plug-in cover that matches the color of the bookcase. Having silver screws show definitely takes away from the overall look. I bought the white one, and it will be easy enough to paint the screws that show. Not so with the other colors offered. Lastly, I think there should be easy to remove labels that identify each piece. The ones provided now take some work to get off, and then more work to get the glue off. Removing them too soon isn't advisable because the alphabet letter is needed for assembly, or in most cases RE-assembly after correcting.These things aside, the bookcase is attractive and serves its purpose well. Its unique configuration is very nice.",
