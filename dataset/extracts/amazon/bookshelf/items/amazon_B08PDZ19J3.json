My daughter who sleeps on the lower bunk wanted something for storage beside her bed for Pok\u00e9mon Cards and her books as well as for other things that seven-year-old girls collect. This so far has been perfect except for the fact that it tips over rather easily. But that is not a huge problem because it is not very big, and I don't expect that it is something that would injure her if it fell on her because it really is not that heavy. If it were against the wall, it would probably be less likely to tip over, but this sits underneath the slide right next to the lower bunk.",

It holds training manuals and since it is attached to the door when you close it, I don't have to bump into those manuals any longer. Excellent product, super easy to put together (I hate those long IKEA-estimated-1-hour-done-in-5-hours instructions). I put it together in less than 15 minutes and had it hanging on the inside closet door in 30 minutes. No more clutter.",

It did come with a pair of gloves to help. I had to use a hammer which I padded with the gloves. It split in a couple of places but not so bad that it is noticeable from the front. I like the way it looks and was just right for the space I had in the bathroom.",

Very easily assembled. It's small and lightweight - perfect for what we wanted (two shelves to hold stuffed animals and have a shelf on top for other things). Also, a great height for a night table next to my son's bed.",

I guess I could diy and get something to hide them, but I didn't want to spend more.If you put it together on your floor, on a carpet, it'll make you feel self-conscious that it was not as clean as you thought because everything stuck to it with static. It is literally putting together puzzle pieces and alone, you might curse a little.I didn't want to pay too much for a side table and it does the job. That's what I needed.",
