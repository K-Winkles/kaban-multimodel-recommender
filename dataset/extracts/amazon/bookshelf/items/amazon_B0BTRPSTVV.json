Because the bookshelf is particle board, I was worried it might look cheap and ugly compared to the good mid-century modern furniture I inherited from my mother and grandmother. No problem! In the photo with the bookshelf next to a solid wood end table, you can see that the bookshelf isn\u2019t as high quality, but it doesn\u2019t clash, especially since that end table normally sits several feet away. (The bookshelf is a darker color, but I knew that when I bought it.) Assembly was reasonably easy; the holes were drilled in the correct places to line up well, all of the hardware was included, and the instructions were clear despite being just a series of pictures. The only tool I used was a hand held Phillips screwdriver. It took me 2.5 hours to assemble, but that\u2019s because I'm a total perfectionist. I work VERY slowly with meticulous attention to detail, and consult the instructions frequently. A normal person could probably assemble it in 45 minutes.",

I treated myself to this with birthday money and it was a GREAT choice! Easy to put together, sturdy (I have a lot of books!), space on the bottom for reading-themed extras...and it takes up little space in my office but holds 5-6 books a shelf, so with 8 shelves that almost 50 books (depending on size and format). This was a wonderful purchase. This bookworm is thrilled!",

Mine wobbles a bit, but that's to be expected as there's only one base point and I didn't use the stabilizing hook to attach the backside to the wall. I'd say mine's holding about 20 lbs of books and it's no problem.",
