I purchased one of these a while back and it was very easy to put together.Once I got it in position, for my liquor bottles (see video) everything fit very well and is an attractive addition to the room.What's nice is that you can easily get a second or third one etc... and scale whatever you're using them for to exactly how many you need. You can split them up in a room and do all different things with them. Honestly, I wish I just had like five more of these to put all over the place in my closets for storage and a few in the living room. They're so great!",

                "reviewText": "Everything about the design and delivery of the shelf was great. It's super sturdy, has a small footprint (working great in the corner of the apartment living room), and only requires two Allen wrenches to assemble and they are included. The only negative is that the shelf I received has a manufacturing defect: The pre-drilled holes for one of the two horizontal stabilizing bars are reversed (the holes are toward the front of the side bracket instead of the rear). I'm an engineer and am certain about this. I thought I was going to have to drill the appropriate holes myself, but the support supplied by the wood shelfs provide more than enough strength and sturdiness, so I just let it go. So . . . a 5-star small shelf, deducting two stars for a clear defect.",

                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful, small bookshelf or nightstand. The wood is a nice color and the corner protectors during shipping were much more protective than I've seen on other furniture I've ordered. This was pretty easy to assemble and I love that the feet are screws on, so you can ensure that everything is level. We have an older home and the rooms aren't exactly square and the floors aren't exactly even in places. I love when furniture gives me the ability to level it without shims!We are using this under a TV in the office for the playstation. We have a PS4 and it fits perfectly on the top level. I was really surprised how wide and sturdy this bookshelf is. The kind of bookshelf that you'd keep for years to come and move with. It is open shelving, but you could put some nice baskets and it'd be beautiful in any room.",
