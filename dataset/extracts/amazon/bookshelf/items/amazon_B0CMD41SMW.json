Can be installed as corner shelf or straight, instructions clear when you get to the point of deciding.Currently around 50 bottles spread out nicely, plenty of room for future expansions \ud83d\ude02",

                "reviewText": "This takes a full two hours to assemble. We got it in today and my husband put it together tonight. It took two hours to assemble start to finish.There are two ways to do this straight across or bent so I can go into a corner. I did straight across. I set this up for my mice and snake habitats. Each shelf should hold 100 pounds. Please watch the directions because originally we put the small shelves to the right and the longer shelves to the left however, the only way you can do this is for the small shelves to be to the left and the long shelves to the right.Once it is assembled, it is extremely sturdy. We got the all white set. Altogether it is a five tier, large bookshelf. I love that there\u2019s multiple assembly options but for us we knew we wanted it straight across the wall. You get four storage hooks, which we put on the side and I have pictured above. it is a solid metal frame. And the wood is particleboard so keep that in mind it cannot get exposed to water.There is an anti-tipping kit that comes with this and we have installed that because I\u2019m putting all of my mice and snake habitats on this unit.I am absolutely thrilled with what I got. I think it\u2019s fantastic. I can\u2019t wait to move all my habitats onto it. I think that putting it together took some time. But luckily my husband has a lot of patience.",
