Books shelves can be bulky and take up a lot of room - this takes up zero floor space which is what I was looking for. Quality material, very sturdy. Took my husband less than 5 minutes to assemble and hang.",

                "reviewText": "So it looks really lovely, but the assembly leaves something to be desired. It's a good thing they include a few extra pieces because (as you can see in my photo) some of them came pre-stripped. The stickers for the assembly parts do NOT come off easily, so you'll want a razor blade and alcohol wipes. I found it relatively easy to assemble, but it's VERY easy to mess it up if you're not paying super close attention to the orientation of the pieces. And when you put the two together, they don't quite line up very well... which was disappointing, but ultimately didn't impact the functionality. Still, I expected more for $60.",
