My biggest concern was whether it would be able to hold the weight of my books, but the product description states that each shelf can hold up to 60 lbs, so I gave it a shot. Each box I had held about 1 shelf's worth of books, and each box weighed about 40 lbs. I've only had this for about 3 months, but the shelves are not showing any signs of bowing, so I'm cautiously optimistic that this bookshelf will hold up.The color was exactly what I was expecting, assembly was simple, and it is a sturdy bookcase.",
