Im worried if I ever have to move it, so I'll probably have to take it apart. Have patience. Your fingers are going to hurt. Id make sure to have a drill bit attachment.

I have a lot of heavy stuff on it...books and boxes of photos and it feels solid and stable. I haven't mounted it to the wall yet, I actually bought an \"L\" bracket rather than using the weird zip tie thing that was included... I had previously ordered a bathroom shelf that also belonged in this line from the same manufacturer...that thing was garbage. I opened it and returned it the same day. I was worried about this one considering it was a bit more expensive and I knew that it needed to be much heavier. I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of this piece is much better than the quality of the bathroom shelf.",

I looked and someone said their's was delivered in two boxes (which was my thought process). However, FedEx says there was only one box received by them. The tracking number on the order only shows one package, and Amazon only shows one package. So now I have a large useless metal stand. I have reach out but heard nothing. Upset would be an understatement.Will update if I finally hear anything...",
