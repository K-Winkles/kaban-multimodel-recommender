I got this with the intention of making it easier for them to dress themselves and gain independence. Assembly was as simple as it could be and quite self explanatory with a bit of common sense. DONT BE STINGY WITH THOSE ZIP TIES! They sent them with this product for a reason. I purchased the boxes separately and used my cricut to label each box for what clothes are in each one. I included the photo without my kids names on them for our privacy. I may just be purchasing more for my closet and getting rid of our dressers all together. I'm very please with this so far. The plastic could be a bit better quality but for 50$ I can't complain.",

                "reviewText": "I've had many kinds of cubes in my life. I like the materials used in these panels better than wire ones or fabric ones. It took me weeks to get these together (and a lot of swearing). The corner clips won't go on some pieces at all and others won't stay in place. I had to rebuild cubes many times because when I moved on to the next row, the cubes below would come apart. The plastic hammer that is included is useless and I can't figure out how to use the zip ties to make the product more stable or sturdy. If you get them correctly put together, they do seem pretty sturdy but they will not hold much weight (10 lbs is too heavy)",
