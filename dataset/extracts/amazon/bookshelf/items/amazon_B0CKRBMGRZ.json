It not only adds extra storage space but also enhances the overall aesthetic of the room. I needed two separate units that where under a certain height and width but not too short or shallow. My bed-frame has pull out drawers and nightstands were too large plus I wanted more display room in a small bedroom. These checked all my boxes.The unit is made of quality, durable material that can hold up to 55 pounds per shelf, making it suitable for storing a variety of items such as books, photo frames, decorative pieces, and more.The unit is available in two sizes \u2013 5-tier and 5-tier Large \u2013 giving you the option to choose according to your storage needs. I purchased the 5-tier large which measures 11.8\"D x 23.6\"W x 71.6\"HI appreciated the easy installation process. It is definitely versatile in terms of placement in the home. I could also see it being used in the living room, kitchen, or bathroom, as a great way to organize and de-clutter.In summary, I highly recommended this storage solution for its functionality, durability, and sleek design. With its affordable price and easy installation process, it is a great addition to any home or office.",

It ended up having cheap quality shelves that had scratches and the metal was spray-painted an ugly yellow-gold. Returned that and decided to take a chance on this unit based on the reviews. Best decision ever! Shelves have a faux wood texture and the metal is a softer, brushed gold colour that gives the unit an elevated aesthetic.",
