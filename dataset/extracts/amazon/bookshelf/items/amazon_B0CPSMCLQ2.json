                "reviewText": "I looks nice but this thing is flimsy. I suggest putting it together right where you are going to have it. I moved it two foot after putting it together and it collapsed and the screws came out and ripped the particle board. I had to rig it back together. Very disappointed in the product because the screws don\u2019t hold well (I\u2019m constantly tightening them) and it\u2019s very flimsy.",

Sadly the only issue is I still have more books to put up! Will definitely get another in the future!",
