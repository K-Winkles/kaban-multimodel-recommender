                "reviewText": "My daughter ordered this product:I recently moved into a studio with tall ceilings and have been looking for items to serve me best with the space I have. I found this great shelf that would help me keep my items organized and look stylish at the same time. The product is recommended to have 2 people for lifting as well as assembly. I would recommend that you have two people help lift, but I don't think it would be necessary to have 2 people assembling the entire shelf, possibly helpful during certain points of the build. I had to unbox outside and carry pieces up to my studio because of the weight of the box and only myself to lift/build. Make sure you have a space to lay the item down to build as well before you get started.The instructions were put together fairly well, it was a little difficult to understand which way the pieces were supposed to face in the beginning, I think it would be beneficial if the seller were to put stickers with 'T' or 'TOP' to speed along the process of deciphering which way they go. All the pieces to use in the build were labeled well and each letter had 1-2 extra pieces(not sure if this will be universal or just in my package). Two of the most difficult parts of putting this together was 1. putting the back pieces on the bottom shelving area because you have to get them in the grooves and also attach the other side while the backing is already attached and 2. the doors if the holes are not in the right place. The pre-drilled holes for one of my side pieces that goes on the bottom enclosed cabinet area were on the wrong side so I had measure and mark where they would go. At first I thought I messed up, but this piece had the groove for the back panel exactly where it was supposed to go. I think it would be beneficial for the seller to put pre-drilled holes on both sides just in case this happens again, this probably added an additional 15 minutes to my build.The feet on the bottom that you screw in allow you to adjust how the shelf sits on the floor which helped me A LOT, I could feel my floors were uneven and with two adjustments to the feet, the shelf felt very sturdy. The way my wall and door/window trim is, I am not able to attach the wall brackets to my wall, but they would add additional support for anyone who would be able to utilize them.I believe this is MDF with a wood grain style peel and stick type wallpaper on top, from far away it looks fairly real and it is a bit lighter because of the MDF, which makes it easier for a single person to move around. I've also added felt pads to the feet which has made it easy to move even with items in the shelf.Overall, my build took 2 hours(not including the trips I took upstairs to bring the pieces inside). If you're looking for something to help with your small space, I would highly recommend this product. If I had the space, I would probably get a second to have two in the same room.",

                "reviewText": "We actually put five of these rattan bookcases in our new home library, and as other customers have mentioned the instructions are extremely hard to follow so it takes a long time and lots of patience to assemble them. My husband did manage to trudge through the process though, and as you can see from the photo, they are quite lovely and they hold a ton of books. We encountered a problem with one of the doors, which had a faulty soft-close hinge that refused to close, no matter how we adjusted it. You can see this in the photo\u2014 it\u2019s the one on the far right side. It\u2019s now over one month later and we did finally receive replacement parts from Sicotas. Communication with their customer service was slow and frustrating but eventually when I expressed my disappointment in writing, they did address my concerns and actually issued a partial refund. Sicotas is a new company (2021 I believe) and I think their products were so wildly popular that they haven\u2019t been able to keep up with demand and they\u2019ve had service issues to work through. I do think they\u2019re trying to do that, and the products are great at this price point. However, you have to know you\u2019re dealing with customer service in China if anything goes wrong with your order. I would much rather buy products made in the USA and avoid this altogether but this is the world we live in now. Overall, I give this 4 stars because my bookcases are gorgeous with strong shelves able to hold up to 60 lbs each and the cabinets are roomy enough to hold all of our large games, puzzles, photo albums, etc. The library is functional and looks fabulous!",

Feel sturdy but I wouldn\u2019t be moving them around a lot. The veneer is thin and you have to be gentle when putting together. Otherwise no other issues with assembly. Doors are totally adjustable to get the perfect fit.",
