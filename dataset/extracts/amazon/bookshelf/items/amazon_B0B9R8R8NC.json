They were easy to put together without the instructions, since they were in another language. It took about fifteen to twenty minutes each shelf. They look nice together and are able to hold the books that I own no problem. The color of the shelves is consistent on each set that we purchased.Fir those who are complaining that it isn't wood, if you read the description you would have known that it was MDF not actual wood shelves. The price was worth it, the shelves are very sturdy and do not sway or rock with the weight I have on them with the books. I would purchase them again if I run out of space.",

                "reviewText": "I like this shelf very much because it is used by me to put my plants on the balcony. I like shopping online very much, which makes me feel very convenient. For me, this installation is relatively simple. I bought two identical shelves for my plants. The height is also very suitable. Both sides and the back are reinforced, Of course, this is also the most attractive thing for me. I am very afraid that my potted plant will fall when placed on it. I like to raise some potted plants and take good care of them. They can provide me with good companionship. Each layer can accommodate three pots of green plants, although there is a need for spacing between them. However, just placing my potted plants looks a bit monotonous. I also decorated the four legs of the rack, which looks great. This is an open shelf, and I placed it against the wall so that my potted plants can be exposed to the sun without worrying about falling off.",

Pay attention to the holes on the metal frame so that you don't reverse any piece as the back cross brace needs to be attached.",

I had to go to my local Lowes and found something very similar and it worked just fine. Besides that minor problem it would of received 5 stars from me.",
