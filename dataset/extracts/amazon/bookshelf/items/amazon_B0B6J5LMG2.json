                "reviewText": "This bookcase had the exact measurements I was searching for to fit my small space. I bought a total of 3 and they're quite sturdy and easy to build. They include additional tools and materials for you if you want to secure the bookcase to the wall.The backing isn't a flimsy cardboard, but an actual side of the bookcase, so my things were able to fit neatly instead of pushing back against the cardboard and ruin a good square space.The manual is very informative and informs you to be careful and evident in making sure you will be ok. The manual comes in a sturdy plastic zip bag, and includes good quality gloves (which helped my hands a lot), stickers for covering the screw holes once you finish building, and all the tools and materials you need to assemble this bookcase.The shelves are adjustable and fit in nicely once you tighten all the screws when you finish assembling.Customer service from the company is fast and helpful. They're very friendly and hope to solve your problem well.TIP: Don't fully tighten the screws on the right and left side of the bookcase until you finish fitting in the backing and shelves. Leave a few centimeters so there's room for you to fit those pieces in, and then tighten them so they fit snugly.Summary:- Easy to build.- Good measurements for small spaces.- Has tools and materials to secure to the wall if you need.- Backing is NOT cardboard, it's an actual sturdy side of the bookcase.- Manual is very informative and detailed, read it carefully. It includes gloves, stickers, and all the tools and materials you need.- Shelves are adjustable.- Customer service is excellent.!!! Don't tighten all the screws until ALL the pieces are put in, so that they can fit snugly after tightening.",

Easy to put together, clear directions and extra parts, well packed and delivered undamaged.This would be an easy five stars if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the paint has a dingy yellowish cast to it. Bummer. We are using these in a closet and you can see here the shelves next to a true white closet shelf for comparison. If you can live with this (or don\u2019t mind repainting) I\u2019d say absolutely get it.",

I definitely will buy more of these shelves because I love the different sizes! Also, they come with these little stickers to hide the nails which I love (but I still need to put them on, they aren\u2019t on in my video)! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had that given to me before. Great little shelf that doesn\u2019t take up too much room and you can always add more to make them seem larger :)",
