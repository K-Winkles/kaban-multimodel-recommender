The instructions were easy to follow and we put it together pretty fast. The drawer sits in the shelf as opposed to being on tracks which mean you could use it on whichever shelf you like. It comes with the hardware to fasten to the wall which is nice if you have small children and the feet are adjustable to help balance on uneven floors. I feel like it\u2019s a great value for the price and I would definitely order it again.",

Well worth the money!",

                "reviewText": "It's a little smaller than I expected, but that's my own fault. My daughter wanted it for her room so I just ordered it without really paying much attention. This is a cheap shelf. The frame is made from low grade, thin, flimsy metal. The shelves are thin with a thin laminate-like surface. Overall though, once assembled, it was sturdier and more functional than I thought it would be. For its small size, it has entirely too many parts to assemble. The metal sections of the sides are around 1 foot sections. I'm sure this is to get it into a small enough box to make delivery costs reasonable. Assembly is pretty straightforward. The directions are actually pretty clear and written in understandable English. I used a battery drill to assemble, but I set the drill clutch on the lowest setting to avoid overtightening. Even that caused the screw heads to pull in a little tight on the thin, flimsy metal. So if you go the power tool route for assembly be extremely careful. I think it would take a long time to assemble using the supplied hex key and screwdriver. Anyway, once assembled it looks nice enough. It's not the type of furniture to survive a move or anything. My teenage daughter wanted it to put some knick-knacks and books on and it serves that purpose well.",
