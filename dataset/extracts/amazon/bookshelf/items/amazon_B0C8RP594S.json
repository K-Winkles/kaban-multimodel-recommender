                "reviewText": "This shelf was even nicer than I expected it to be. The boards are not real wood, but they are press board/MDF type material. They are much sturdier than the particle board that inexpensive furniture is often made of. The poles are some type of metal alloy and are relatively sturdy. Certainly sturdy enough for their purpose. It comes with a combo Allen wrench/Phillips screwdriver, but I recommend using a regular sized Phillips screw driver. Some of the screws were pretty tight to get in, and I think it would have been pretty hard to use the small tool that is included. Please forgive the mess, I just put some stuff on there to give some bit of size perspective.Measurements in the listing appear accurate. The only other thing potentially useful I can think of is that the space between the inside of the black pole and the other side of the shelf is just over 13.5 inches wide. In other words, the shelf itself is 15.7 inches wide overall, but you could only fit something about 13.5 inches wide on the shelf.",

It can be used as side table next to your bed or as I bookcase in your study or office space. This can be definitely used in dorm room or kids study as well. Very functional. It came with proper instructions and was easy to assemble. It is Black in the color which matches well with other furniture i.e. my computer table and office chair. It is not bulky or very heavy.",

                "reviewText": "As usual, this self-assemble furniture isn't an easy build. The instructions aren't clear, mostly because the important details are too tiny to see. The design uses some allen bolts but also a lot of wood screws, so be ready to put some extra effort into screwing those wood screws in, especially considering the nontraditional zigzagging boards.Picture 1: This was me just trying to do step 1. You can probably deduce more than what I was trying to convey here, but you can see how there's two holes next to each other on the board, but it's very small in the instructions.Picture 2: I was at step 3 here, trying to figure out how to attach board 3. Phone didn't capture it well I guess, but there's supposed to be two holes in each corner of this board. There's one missing. Checking the other side, they did drill a hole, but didn't go all the way through. It ended up being fine since the wood screw was able to get through the remaining part of the board.Picture 3: This is the worst of the cosmetic damage across the whole side table, so I guess I'm thankful that there weren't gouges or smashed in corners or anything like that.In the end, I got it together. I had to use my own screwdriver by the way, and you should too. Trying to screw in wood screws with their combo allen wrench-screwdriver doesn't have the grip or the torque to do the job very efficiently. Even with my real screwdriver my hand was shaking a little when I was done.The design for the legs makes it a bit tricky for the bottom legs. It's easy for the table to be built wobbly if you don't screw down the legs evenly. (There are screw-in feet but I didn't consider adjusting them since they're really lose as soon as you back them out.) After noticing a very slight wobble on a hard surface, I went back and adjusted the legs and now it's stable.So really, a decent design, but I'd like some more care during manufacturing to completely drill out holes, and some care throughout the whole process to prevent scratching damage like in my picture.",

I had planned to use it as a computer storage area but then switched to using it as a printer stand. I LOVE IT. As a printer stand it's a little tall and it does a little shimmy as the printer is going, but it's not meant to be a printer stand so that's FINE with me. It LOOKS fabulous and is worth the shimmy.Everyone that has come into my office has asked me where I got it, & my daughter tried to take it. It's great.It's perfect for nice looking storage or just a modern decor display shelf.SO versatile. We will have this for a LONG time.10/10",

I'm quite happy with both how it looks the quality of the build/materials! Also, I have a black Ikea Malm corner desk and this matched it perfectly color-wise.My only complaint is that the instructions were a little unclear. One side of the shelf panels have little milled out sections, seemingly for a bolt head to tighten flush, but this isn't indicated visually or textually anywhere in the instructions in regards to which direction it should be facing. It's not a big problem at all, as it still assembles easily from visual reference and the milled areas are covered regardless--just something to note.I definitely recommend this. It's nice and modern looking, assembles fairly quick and easily, and feels quite sturdy all put together.",
