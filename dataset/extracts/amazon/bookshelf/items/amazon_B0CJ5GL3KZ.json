                "reviewText": "I bought this for my son's bedroom to use as a tv stand/display shelf. It even better than I was expecting. It's very sturdy, as long as you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS and use the little disposable hammer to tap the pieces fully together. We built it with 5 sections, 4 high, but left out 2 of the pieces in the middle to allow room for the tv to fit in the middle. I also bought 2 pieces of 11x14 acrylic to put under the tv for extra support. It looks beautiful and has added space and storage to his room. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "It's a rather large piece once fully assembled and was incredibly light, which had me thinking it would be perfect for my next move when I have to drag all my crap somewhere else. Unfortunately it was only sturdy while empty and as soon as I started filling the shelves it started tipping to either side. An hour after going to bed I was gently awoken by the sound of the entire bookshelf falling to pieces and throwing my books across the room. The aluminum bars that make up the central support had crumpled in on themselves and were completely unsalvageable.The bookshelf did come with anchors for the wall but I'm both renting and without a drill at the moment. Figured those were to keep it from being tipped forwards but if they're required for the bookcase to stand freely that's rather disappointing.They either need to use thicker bars of aluminum or move onto steel. Alternatively a solid piece to run along the middle holes to either side of the bookcase- and touch the floor for extra support- would probably help with its stability, though that would require a much larger package and wouldn't be viable for the alternative build option.Overall, fine if you want to display some knickknacks- hopefully both light and durable, just in case- but not so good if you actually want to use it as a bookcase.",

                "reviewText": "For it's price it's a decent solution for sorting things like shoes, purses, light craft items, tubs of decorations, etc. But it's not sturdy enough or flat enough to reliably store books or other items of real weight. My main complaint is the \"floor\" of each cubicle - the photos on the ad show plants and other such items on there - but in reality, the base is a piece of cloth stretched across the 4 poles. Items like small vases sag between the poles and fall over. If you want to add the expense of putting 1/8\" plywood or plastic panels under the cloth it might work, but otherwise, you're limited to tubs or larger flat items that can span the poles without leaning.On the plus side, It is easy to assemble and is light enough to move by hand when completely built, and if you buy more than one, you can add them together to make one large rack. On the negative, I wouldn't trust it with the advertised 33 lbs. in every cube (totaling almost 600 lbs.). It's not a bad product, it's just not made to be a bookshelf or store heavy things, so choose accordingly.",
