Overall, it meets my needs and wasn't the hardest thing in the world to assemble, but it did require tools. Maybe some people can do it without them, but for me, it made the job easier. Also, a couple of the screws were broken, but because this came used, and I was able to improvise, it's not a big deal. The shelf fits perfectly next to my desk and I'm happy with it. Also the price was good for me and it arrived on schedule, so I'm giving it 5 stars.",

Would also work well for chapter books or small decor itemsThis will NOT work with average storage bins/baskets that are larger than 9\" so keep that in mind if you need something like the Target storage shelves with larger cubes.Material is typical MDF but not very heavy. If was relatively easy to put together. I did it by myself in about 45 minutes using a power screwdriver and I did not use the backing pieces because I wanted open shelves. (The back has unfinished edges but they don't show in the way it's placed against the foot of my bed).Just make sure you align the shelves properly when putting together because it's very easy to screw a new hole into the shelf material.The screws showing are a little annoying and the white paper stickers are cheap (and not enough to cover all of them anyway) so a better option is using a white paint pen or white nail polish to hide the screw heads of they bother you.Pay attention to the measurements and if you don't need it for larger storage or items weighing more than 10bs (max per shelf) than this might be the small solution you are looking for.",

It's nice and sturdy, I put it together in about 15 min with just a hand screw driver. I'm going to fix it at the bottom and back to the rv so that it doesn't move during travel, I love it so far! Only complaint - the stupid \"A\" \"B\" stickers indicating the shelves do not come off easy and in fact peel off the laminate.... even when I was careful the finish was damaged. So definitely use goof off or something similar to peel them up gently with assistance. I had to fix one goof with a black sharpie.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: smaller than anticipated, overpriced compared to similar bookcase from Walmart, instructions could he clearerI purchased this 5 tier/shelf bookcase anticipating it to be pretty much the exact same bookcase as the \"Mainstays 5-Shelf Bookcase with Adjustable Shelves\" that is sold by Walmart. It most definitely is not - much shorter and more narrow than the Mainstays one. CHECK SIZING BEFORE BUYING. My fault for not double checking, but the way this was marketed definitely felt like it was purposefully trying to look bigger than it actually is (if I were to be honest, feels like they were trying to trick the customer into thinking it's a replicate of the Mainstays one, especially since pictures and pricing were similar). Only purchased this one on Amazon because the Mainstays has been out of stock for quite some time now (2 months as of time of writing) so jumped the gun on this purchase, thinking they would be the same.Quality definitely feels cheap. I have had the Mainstays bookcase prior and this Amazon one feels the same quality. For this one being the same price as the Mainstays one but smaller in size, I think this is overpriced for what it is. Knocking off a star for this.Building instructions are not very clear as there were only diagrams and no words to clarify which sides were top or bottom. Definitely look at the blown out picture of all the pieces put together and take into account which panel is top, bottom, left, right. Knocking off a star for this.Overall: 3/5 stars",

                "reviewText": "I bought a whole bunch of Furinno shelves of various sizes as part of a major closet overhaul at the house. The shelves arrived quickly and these 7 box units were the largest of the items I ordered.All of them are very efficiently packaged with clear instructions on assembly. I was able to put them together easily by myself. However I HIGHLY recommend having an electric screwdriver or cordless drill as your wrists will give out if you do this with a regular screwdriver. There are probably 26 screws on this one unit alone that take some work, and if you have multiple shelves you'll need to take a lot of breaks.Having said that the only caution with electric is to make sure the screw is straight. I slightly damaged one shelf when I wasn't paying attention and let a screw pop-out on the surface. No big deal though.The 7 box differs from the smaller shelves (5 box and smaller) in that it makes use of wooden dowels to help align and secure the parts. These add work but actually make assembly easier as the dowels line all the screw holes up cleanly and help \"hold\" the parts while putting in the screws.I didn't need to put the backs on the shelves as they were going up in closets. The 7 box units also have more finishing on the shelf edges as the smaller box units have clear \"backs\" that aren't painted where the backing is typically nailed in. Not putting in the backs probably saved me 5 min assembly time.The units look great once I put them up and have so far proven sturdy. Have to really call out the precision that all the holes are drilled and that so far no missing parts. Excellent overall quality and highly recommended.",
