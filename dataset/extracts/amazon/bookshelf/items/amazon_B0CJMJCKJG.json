While that one is definitely higher quality/has thicker shelves, this one wins for me in terms of color and general quality for the price. It matches the other furniture I have well and works for what I need. Assembly was also very straightforward (I have assembled plenty of amazon furniture at this point, so that may not be the case for others who have not as the instructions are pictures only). My only complaint is that the L wrench it came with kept getting stuck in some of the screws and that you need to pay close attention to which side of the legs the holes face.",

However, I can not drop it off to the drop off locations because it is too heavy and I decide to keep them. All the shelves came damaged in one side. It looks fairly good, but kinda sad that they came damaged.",
