                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these shelves to go on either side of my tv. They arrived on time and had everything I needed in the box to assemble them. Each shelf took about 30 mins or so to put together by myself. They were easy to assemble, and I\u2019d imagine it would be even easier if you had a partner helping like the instructions suggest. All holes lined up properly. One thing I will say is that you need to be careful not to over tighten the screws as the metal tubes do deform if you do. I had one screw pop through a screw hole because I screwed it in too tightly. Just watch the metal tube as you tighten. As soon as you see the metal start to indent, stop! I was able to whack it back out using a rubber mallet, so no real harm done. The shelves seem sturdy enough. They would probably be better if they had adjustable feet you could use to level them off. I did not use the anti-tip kit that was included because I don\u2019t have any children or overly feisty pets to worry about. If you do, I would suggest using the kit just to be safe.",

Took me maybe 30 minutes to assemble because I put one side on wrong (my fault, I didn\u2019t see the hole in the back that needed to line up with the other side). I have a candle museum as my husband calls it, 86 to be exact and it doesn\u2019t even budge under that weight. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs it for whatever.
