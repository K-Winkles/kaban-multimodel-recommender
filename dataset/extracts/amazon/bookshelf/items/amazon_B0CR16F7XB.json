I love that this little tray sits on your couch and can hold your coffee, book spot and pen while you get up. It is really cute as well to leave out and has a beautiful burnished design in the wood.The piece itself is made well and smooth. It comes almost assembled and just needs the two book holder wedges snapped together (they do easily) and add the silicone grips to the bottom of the tray so it doesn't move. Great gift idea as well!",
