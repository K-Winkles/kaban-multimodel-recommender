It light enough that I can pick it up with just a few fingers. If you have small children or pets, you may find they will easily knock this over. Given its construction, I believe the price point for this is a little high. It comes fully assembled, so if you are worried about that, this is a plus.",

In the 1st pic it looks like mold across the back slat, and the side is full of brown dirt - my hands were dirty just from touching it. The shipping box was all torn up (which could be from the delivery service). The 3rd pic shows where the 2 bolts securing the ladder jut out, the manufacturer couldn\u2019t use shorter bolts? It looks tacky and you could easily get snagged on it. I knew before I bought it that it was cheap and not very sturdy, but for its intended purpose that would have been fine were it not for the filthy, gross condition it arrived in so it\u2019s going back. To say I\u2019m disappointed is an understatement because otherwise it was just what I was looking for but instead I\u2019m disgusted. Shame on you Milltown.7/3/23: I would like to amend my review after speaking to Milltown. They were impressively fast in addressing the issue and took full responsibility for the damaged item. They offered to either replace it or issue a full refund. Things happen, I don\u2019t hold it against them especially after the steps they took to remedy the problem, which is somewhat of a rarity these days. Thank you Milltown!",
