It went together easy (my 13yo daughter put 90% of it together), feels sturdy enough for books and LEGO sets, and looks really nice. Is this an heirloom piece? No, obviously not. But it was what we needed. And we\u2019ll probably order a couple more.",

It is easy enough to assemble just a bit time consuming. It took about an hour to set up partly because we did put one of the sides on backwards and had to go back and fix it. So I would just pay attention to the directions hahaha",
