I had zero issues with the installation but I also do know how to use the larger expansion nail piece that the nail sits in. I didn't learn how to do this until this year, but it\u2019s extremely easy. If you are unsure I would recommend watching a quick youtube tutorial. Overall it took me about 10 min to set this shelf up by myself.It has been up for about a week now and I\u2019m very happy with it. The sleek white minimalistic design was exactly what I was going for and I have zero complaints about the quality or sturdiness.",

It not only came with 4 screws and 2 metal anchors but a tiny bubble level tool to make sure it was straight. Depending on what you plan to store on this I would make sure it was properly anchored or secured to a stud. This shelf does have thickness and weight to it. I would say it can hold 28 dvds or 36 blu-rays.",

I thought it came with a quality paint-job. BTW: the kid likend them too. If you aren't the type of shopper who lays awake at night wondering if they could have saved a few more bucks on that purchase if they had only argued a few hours more, you might be pleased with your purchase..",

I would have given a 5 star, except one of the four shelves came with considerable bowing that I couldn't fix by hand or with my available tools. This causes the books to sit unevenly and the sides to pinch in a little. Noticeable, but not worth the effort to rip out of the wall and return. Would love to see more color options.",
