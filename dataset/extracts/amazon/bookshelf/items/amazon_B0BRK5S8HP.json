                "reviewText": "I have done many flat pack put together before and this is one of the easiest I've ever done. All simple screws. No funky ways to join it together just straightforward screws. There are front in the back to the metal pieces so be sure you have all of the holes on the correct side. And the top it has a front and a back. The rest of the shelves are so well finished all sides are finished so it doesn't matter which is front and back or top or bottom for the shelves. Both front feet are adjustable so no wiggling. I didn't need to adjust the back feet, I think that they are adjustable but I can't say for sure. Very stable when it goes together no wiggling. I got it together by myself in about an hour. It would definitely be easier and faster with two people probably would take 20 minutes. The back instead of being a flimsy cardboard thing that gets nailed on is actually thicker and get screwed on as well. Super simple to put together. Was well packaged. Arrived with no damage. Shelves are nice thick definitely will hold my books without sagging. Whatever the Finish is on these it does not appear to be thin paper but some sort of hard laminate. It looks like it should hold up well and it looks like real wood. Was also provided with one to two extra screws per type of screw. I didn't need them but it's always nice for that one that the cat helps you lose. This was a great deal. I could not have purchased wood and built one for this price.",

The shelf came in 1 box and was a bit heavy but I could get it in the house. I assembled by myself and the instructions are very simple. It was easy to put together and you don't need additional tools to assemble. Everything you need is in the package. The shelf is very sturdy and I think for what Im using it for it will last a very long time. I like so much I will be ordering a second one right away. I highly recommend!",
