                "reviewText": "As soon as I opened the package and felt the tubes.. I knew this was a cheaply made item.. but tbh.. I kinda knew that it was going to be on the cheap side for what I paid.I cant complain. A few recommendations: read the instructions fully before starting to try and put it together .. I would have assembled the entire thing straight up had I not checked out the instructions all the way to the end and seen the second way to arrange it. 2nd... use the hammer... it's definitely a cheap hammer but it works for what is needed... I saw a good amount of reviews with pictures of the thing falling apart when they put stuff on it... I have books.. dvds.. my record player.. and some other things as it can be seen on the photos... and the thing holds up pretty nicely ... and 3rd. Take your time.. I had to make myself slow down when I got about halfway done and started trying to get it done.... I started putting things on backwards and having to take then off and re do them a few times...I'm happy with my purchase and probably would get it again of I had to or needed another one and the best thing about the whole thing is that my books finally got out of those boxes and have a home. I had enough space for all of them and still have space for other things .. probably going to use it for my yarn and crocheting supplies.Did not have problems with missing parts like other reviews mentioned and had not problem with the thing keeping tight and together (use the hammer)We will see how long it holds up.Hope this helps.",

I bought it for kitchen appliances and for cook books, and it won't hold up to the job. I wasted my money!",

Every part feels cheap and flimsy. It looked nice at first. It didn\u2019t last a month before it started falling apart and the bars fall out of place then if you try to put it back together other bars fall out so you have to take the whole thing apart and the plastic parts started to crack, so I don\u2019t think the weight support was accurate. We had small bins of Barbie\u2019s/lol dolls on the bottom shelves then clothes on the upper shelves nothing crazy.",

It is in my daughters room and she has clothe drawers in all the cubbies holding all her clothes and other things like books and toys. First putting it together I was worried it wasn\u2019t going to hold up. It seemed cheap. But we got it all together and mounted to the wall and it\u2019s actually very steady. She also put her sound bar and other items on top and it\u2019s not leaning or bending or coming apart at all. She loves it bc it does not take up a lot of space but holds everything she needs it to. So I ordered 2 more, one for our mud room and one for our other kids room. I would definitely recommend it, just make sure you mount it to the wall in studs.",

                "reviewText": "So after opening the box I was a bit concerned. That should have been the 1st red flag!!Assembly was super easy & fast but I realized all too soon how flimsy it is. Once assembled, you can ONLY lift it into place. Any slight movement, such a pulling/pushing on it will cause it to collapse. Red flag #2....I've had to warn my boys about it collapsing several time & when they don't listen, I have to disassemble & reassemble it. It a great product once it's assembled & left alone, but if ever moved, it's a headache!!I'm currently looking into finding some kind of permanent adhesive I could use to keep it more solid. But that's my 2 cents on the matter. Hope this review helps.",

The variations you can build interested me the most! I was able to put the unit together 100% by myself in about 30 minutes. Once assembled I could move the unit with one hand, it was very light. It comes with a wall strap to hold to wall for safety. It also came with a pair of gloves and wooden hammer. The instructions provided show the additional ways to put the shelf together and how many of each wall panel and metal rod you would need.",
