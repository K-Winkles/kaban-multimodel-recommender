Perfect for electronics, lamps, books and other decor. Great piece of furniture, and the price was good. Due to its being manufactured wood, my guess it\u2019s a veneer over a light weight plywood. It\u2019s not something you can sand down and refinish, but it weighs 59-60 lbs less than solid wood at a much better price.",

                "reviewText": "The shelf has braces and gussets in all the right places. It is a very sturdy shelf. The leveling foot at the centerline of the shelf will give extra support if adjusted to be in contact with the floor, this will prevent shelf sagging when heavily loaded.Assembly was a breeze, instructions were clear (study the diagrams as you go, they answer all questions). All parts are clearly labeled. All holes were precise, and all threaded holes were perfect with no stripped threads. I found one bad cam bolt, but multiple spares of all threaded parts are provided in the package. The packaging itself was good and the item arrived un-damaged.I'm going to use the shelf in my music area for music books, headphones, a couple of small guitar amps, cords, laptop, etc. I expect to get many years of use out of this.",
