The shipping was fast and nearly everything was perfect. I even received a screw driver in my box. That\u2019s very thoughtful!The only cons are that some of the pilot hole were slightly off, but I managed to get it put together. And the base \u201cspinning\u201d isn\u2019t great. However for the price I am more than content! Great product!If you like sturdy and well made furniture then this is definitely for you!",

An attractive, wooden shelf, this product checks off all the boxes. First, and foremost, it is sturdy. Furthermore, it doesn't take up too much space. As far as the difficulty of assembly, it's not too shabby.

So much easier than I anticipated when I opened the box and saw all the pieces. Got it all put together in roughly 10 minutes.My only critique is that the wood seems to be without a finish. It is sanded nice a smooth but no finish. So that makes it harder to clean If something we\u2019re to spill on it accidentally.So I will take the time to brush on a couple coats of poly.Even with that it is still worth it for real wood, in my opinion.",

The slots are perfect for smaller books and novels, but larger books won't work. This unique shelf looks good and goes with most all decor.",
