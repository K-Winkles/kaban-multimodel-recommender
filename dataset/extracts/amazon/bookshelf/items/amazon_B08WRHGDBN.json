HOWEVER it is wobbly and does not sit flush on the floor. The 3 back cardboard pieces are just 2mm shy in being about to be nailed down so only the top parts are nailed down and if you hit against it they rattle. They do come with hooks so I'll def be having to attach them to the wall. Otherwise color is gorgeous and it'll get the job done for a kids room.",

                "reviewText": "While the pieces were packaged well and arrived in good condition, the quality of the mass produced pieces resulted in an ill-fitting and unflattering finished product. The screw heads are left showing on the top and are be covered with stickers. Very disappointing.The cardboard back came in three separate pieces!! Why? Since they didn't line up, it left the top jutting up over top of the bookcase. Looks like crap. And the legs are so thin, it's wobbly.(Updated...adding books stabilized it a bit. Still recommend anchoring if used on carpet)Updated: While it's not very expensive, it's still disappointing to have the stickers in plain view on the tops of the shelves. And they catch the book edges. I like the offsets for the spaces...may keep shelves from sagging. I just wish more thought had been given to how it would look after assembly.",

It had to be the right height and width and this one is perfect. It wasn't too hard to build, about 30 minutes, and it's sturdy. I chose not to add the backing cause that was the only flimsy material included. Overall, it works and I finally have 90% of my books shelved and ready to read again.",
