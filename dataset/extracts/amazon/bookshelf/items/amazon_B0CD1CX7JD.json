The instructions don't really clarify that , but now that I have put it together, taken it apart, put it together , taken it apart, then finally realized I was making this way harder than I needed to, put it together the final time. Bottom line of you can deduce common sense, it is super easy to put together. Look at me. I put it together 3 times! Go me! It is a really sturdy , strong piece. And hey! It even survived me assembling and disassembling this dang thing OH so many times. I really like the look as well. And BONUS,.it matches my antique buffet that my husband commandeered as a stand for his insanely and ungodly huge TV. Bottom line, this shelving unit is strong, resilient and beautiful.

Recommend 2 people, for sure, as it would be much easier, and even quicker! It looks so beautiful in my living room, and has more space than I even thought it was. Super sturdy, too!",

                "reviewText": "Assembly was really NOT that bad at all. A little bit tedious and while it's illustrated fairly well, it's similar to how ikea instructions try to do more with pics than words. Took me about an hour to get it up and ready to store a few tons of books. It looks really good and once all the shelves are tied together with the back bracing, it's incredibly sturdy. For the price it can't be beat. If I built one out of oak, it would technically be better and nicer, but also cost me more in raw material than this thing cost to be dropped off at the door ready to assemble. ---it is VERY heavy to try and move the shipping box by yourself, just FYI.",

It also looks great, customers often ask where we got it, it is just a great piece overall.Really the quality is through the roof too. It has been a long time since I put together furniture that was as easy as this. If this brand stays strong and does not start cost cutting measures like other brands have done many times in the past we will stick with IRONCK for all simple furniture needs.",

If you don't have spare room It can be a bit of a pain though. Most importantly, make sure the holes on the metal frame are all on one side for the crossing braces so you don't have to redo your work. Also make sure your sides are lined up correctly in the metal frame so you don't have to move 4 of the 5 shelves like I did to be able to add in the center floating shelves, lol.",
