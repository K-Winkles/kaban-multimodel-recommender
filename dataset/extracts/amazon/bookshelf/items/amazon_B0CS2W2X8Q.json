She has an aquarium and she needed a good shelf that she could set the aquarium on top of and this shelf makes it perfect. It was really easy to put together, we had no issues with the instructions and it's a beautiful shelf. This really compliments the other furniture in her room. I would absolutely recommend and especially for the price. It's a great deal.",

I tried to set it upright at the completion of the assembly - I requested that a neighbor help me - we were careful but the case fell apart - it was so damaged that the parts cannot be saved. It was intended to hold books -but I daresay that it is not solid enough to hold books. I suppose it would do for knickknacks-",
