So short of finding a power saw to chop off the excess and make new holes there is no way to actually build and use this.Even worse, the \u201cproduct support\u201d is useless.MoniBloom has the worst customer service I\u2019ve ever dealt with. As the manufacturer, they\u2019re supposed to be able to send replacement pieces for defective products.The person I emailed only replied \u201camazon fulfilled it talk to them\u201d so I sent them a picture of the product support page that made it clear they were responsible for replacing it only for them to repeat the same thing and ignore my next three emails.Kept badgering them and apparently the replacement parts I need are out of stock and they don\u2019t know when/if they\u2019ll get them back in.Waste of money, do not buy monibloom productsP.S. it should be noted that amazon customer service was helpful but I missed the full refund window (having assumed it wouldn\u2019t be defective and I could build it later) and they can\u2019t do anything about replacing the defective pieces.",

The unit is lightweight, but seems sturdy enough, I guess. The shelves are constructed in such a way that there is a frame/ridge around each edge of each shelf, causing books to run into a tiny \"curb\" instead of sitting flush against the side of the cubby. Removing and flipping the shelf makes no difference. I suppose it isn't a huge deal, and it's not worth returning the unit. But, if purchasers plan on using this as a bookshelf, heads-up.",

The mounting holes for the top and bottom panels do not match up with the side panels If the groove for the back panel is lined up, the forward mounting holes do not. I design machines for a living and a simple CAD layout would show the error. This is a serious Quality control issue. The fact that they let this design out of the factory without actually trying to assemble one says quite a bit about the manufacturer. I was looking forward to having and using this product. It would have served my purposes well. Unfortunately, I have to find another one or take the time to build my own.",
