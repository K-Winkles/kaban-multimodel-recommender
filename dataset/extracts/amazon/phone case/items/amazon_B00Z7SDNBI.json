I have owned LifeProof brand as well, however, I must say that I'm impressed by the durability and protection offered by this particular model, since my phone have fallen several times from random heights and this protector has been able to keep my phone intact. I highly suggest this defender series not only for Iphone, but for any other brand, it really worth what I paid. Considering phones nowadays cost around 1000$, the cost of this protector will pay itself.",
