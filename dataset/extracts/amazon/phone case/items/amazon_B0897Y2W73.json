                "reviewText": "This is great. It\u2019s a flexible holder that securely holds your phone in place while you row. I\u2019ve used it for two years without issue, and it should last ten years or more.It\u2019s so much better than the clumsy phone holder that comes with the Concept 2 rower. You\u2019d think for the price of the rower, they could include something better than a piece of rigid plastic that requires forcefully wedging your phone in place. (I was scared my phone would slip out and be flung across the room.)This holder is much nicer. It is a soft silicone that hits the right balance of flexible but secure. It fits my iPhone SE (2020 edition, so like an iPhone 8 size) and my wife\u2019s slightly larger iPhone 11 without issue. The top and bottom each have a lip that latches onto your phone and the grippy silicone ensures your phone never slides left to right.You have to be careful that the mount is not pressing the buttons on the side of your phone, but there are sort of notches or spaces on in bottom part of holder to make this easy.",

                "reviewText": "Such a simple idea and it's absolutely genius. The plastic piece is hollow at the base so it slips over the top of the rower's monitor - perfect positioning to allow you to watch both the monitor and the phone screen. The fit is secure, both the holder to the monitor and where you clip a phone into the holder. Easy to \"install\" and to put the phone in/take it out. In terms of the size of phones it works with, after this arrived we got new phones and found the holder works with both a Galaxy S9 and a larger Galaxy S21+. Every product should be this perfect!",

It is a clean look, doesn't make it overly complicated, doesn't leave marks and can't really cause scratches or damage of any sort.The holder that came with the machine actually sucks a lot, I couldn't get my phone positioned right and I ended up looking down more than up, and that's not the goal, having the phone up higher is a much better position. Also, I feel that the one that came with the machine will scratch the machine in the long run, this one won't.10/10 would recommend!",
