                "reviewText": "I am astonished. This actually works. The screen protector allows me to do touch controls on my phone. The case feels rugged enough. The set up instructions were very clear. I needed to get the case off to replace my SIM card. That was a bit tricky. With practice I was able to get the case off and put it back on. The clear back shows the color of my phone. I am not used to that. I worry that people can see the Apple logo. I am going to print a photo and put it inside the case. I think that would be lovely. The clear back would show it to great effect.The case covers the outside switch for silencing the phone as well as the port for charging. If you want access you must pry back the little flap. It is very stiff when new. For some people that could be a real plus. If you use a wireless charger you don\u2019t ever need access to the charging port. Having it covered helps to keep it clean. The phone settings menu can silence your phone on a set schedule so you might not ever need access to the outside switch to silence your phone. If you have wireless headphones you don\u2019t need to plug your headphones into the charging port. The the volume and power buttons are easily accessed through the case.I am prone to dropping my phone a lot and the case offers superior protection from dropping the phone. I am not sure what the screen cover is for. Perhaps if you have keys in your pocket with your phone. I have a zippered pocket on the side of my purse so it makes no difference to me.Overall I am very pleased with this case. I would absolutely recommend it. The purple color is lovely. Very pretty.With my previous phone my purple hair tended to stain the white case. Am hoping that will be less of a problem with a purple phone in a purple case.",

                "reviewText": "This morning when I was trying to leave for work, I put my phone on top of my car to run back in the house for my water bottle. And of course, I forgot about the phone. As I was coming up to speed on the interstate, I saw something FLY off the roof of my car and hit the road behind me. I knew immediately what it was and panicked. I pulled over to the side of the interstate, ran back up the on-ramp, and stood there, out of the way of the traffic, 8 feet away from my phone, unable to do anything while cars were whizzing by me. I watched as three cars ran over my phone in succession. And I was heartsick knowing I'd need to buy a new phone. Traffic cleared for a hot second, and I ran out, snached it up, and ran back to the break-down lane to assess the damage as I walked back to my car. The case is HASHED. The front has scratches and scrapes. You can see tire tracks on the back. My pop-socket broke and there is grit stuck in between the two parts of the case. The phone? Screen didn't even crack. Not a scratch on it, including the camera lenses. This was a lucky turn of events, that the initial impact didn't break it, that rolling a bit didn't scratch it, than multiple cars didn't destroy it. I've gotta say, this case was amazing for keeping the phone protected. I complained to my husband a while back that the case isn't very \"pretty\". It doesn't have flowers or a design on it. I thought about buying another one that has more personality to it, but got lazy and never got around to it. I'm glad about that now. Holy cow, does this case do it's job. I got on Amazon as soon as I got to work and ordered the same case again. I am very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this case for 2 days and so far I\u2019ve been impressed enough that I wanted to do a review on it even before owning it long term. It compares well to an Otterbox Defender. It feels like it would provide the same kind of protection without feeling overly bulky doing so. The fit is tight around the phone. It\u2019s not hard to install but it\u2019s a bit difficult to remove if need be. But once the phone is in the case it feels like the phone and case together are one complete device. The form fit is excellent! The phone is very easy to hold and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m about to drop it. Touch screen functions are smooth, buttons press easily, cutouts for microphones, cameras, and speakers are perfectly aligned, and everything works well together. The cameras are recessed just enough to prevent contact when laid on a flat surface. You may want to consider adding a camera protector since the lenses are so exposed, as the case does not cover them. I think a black tinted one would look excellent with this case.I did not rate scratch resistance due to owning it such a short time, but it feels about like any other case I\u2019ve had before in that area. I expect over time that car keys will take their toll in my pocket, but again, it\u2019s not a Defender so cost wise I could replace it twice and still save money, and a Defender would not be anymore scratch resistant itself.UPDATE - I have had the case for a little over 2 weeks now. For reference, I carry my phone in my front pocket of my jeans, usually by itself, but 5 days a week it also shares that pocket with another company issued iPhone 8 Plus in a Defender case riding along side of it. Nothing else goes in that pocket, no keys, no loose change, nothing! I do have an active job though, and the phones go in and out of my pocket a lot, and see their share of bumps and jolts even when in my pocket. My personal phone has taken a couple of minor falls from this, but nothing severe at all so far and no damage to the phone has happened, but the case does have its first few light scratches. On the back there is one small scratch that I can feel with my fingernail. I\u2019m not sure how that even happened but I know it occurred within the first 4 or 5 days of owning it, and prior to its first fall. On the front there are signs of very light wear scratches from finger sliding on the surface as I use the phone. This is completely normal and insignificant. I only mentioned it just to acknowledge that it has occurred, but I expected this from the beginning. This phone case does show fingerprints so be aware of that. I am adding a few new pics to this review to show these things, mostly to make this review as complete as possible, and just for the fun of it, and I will also continue to update it as needed. So far my 5 star rating remains unchanged and I am still completely satisfied with the case.UPDATE - It\u2019s been a month now and the case has survived two falls so far, one landing on concrete from tabletop height where I had the phone propped up and it accidentally got knocked off. The case saved the phone and only shows a small \u201cpolished\u201d spot on one corner of the matte finished rubber where it impacted the floor. No further scratching has appeared on the clear front or back, and I am a HEAVY user of my phone so it sees a lot of contact.UPDATE - It has been 2 months since I got this case. With constant contact, you might say \u201cdaily wear\u201d, the polished spot on the rubber from the fall I mentioned above has faded so that it doesn\u2019t even show much. Self healing, maybe? Also I clean my case with the phone in it every few days by spraying the front and back with eye glass cleaner and wiping with a soft cloth to remove fingerprints and oils. The clear surfaces have held up well, resisting scratching from finger sliding, and once they\u2019re cleaned they look new again. I hardly see any scratching at all, other than mentioned before. I also want to mention that this case has 5 holes on the top front where the iPhone notch is to allow proper use of the camera and speaker. This potentially could allow dirt to enter into the case. So far that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. My wife got a different case for her phone at the same time I got this one and hers let\u2019s dust enter into those holes so she has a splattered look of dirt on the inside. I can tell you from experience using an Otterbox, which also has openings, that dirt like that WILL scratch an iPhone screen! It is very good that that does not seem to be happening with this case. The cover lays flat enough against the screen that dirt entering just doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem. The inside of the front cover also seemed to have a mild tackiness to it, and at first I thought this probably helped it to lay flat by adhering to the screen, but as I have removed the case to clean it a time or two I noticed that the tackiness itself had a tendency to grab and hold airborne dust while the case was opened. The dust was then hard to remove so I ended up washing the tackiness off. The case still lays flat after putting the phone back in, and I think maybe the tackiness was just left over from when I peeled the protective coatings off before originally putting the phone inside.The only thing I have not covered is wireless charging. I have no reason to believe it would not work due to the lack of metals and clear back panel, but I charge with a wall brick and cord so I don\u2019t know about that. But after 2 months and a few falls, heavy daily usage, the phone is in excellent condition, and the case still looks mostly new. Considering the cost and performance, a 5 star rating is well deserved.",
