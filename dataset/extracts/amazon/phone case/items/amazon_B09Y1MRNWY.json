I don't think I'll be chancing taking my phone in the pool or anything for pics.Got it mostly for an oops just in case situation.Fit my phone perfectly. Samsung A54Seems pretty durable. I've dropped my phone a couple times and it's still in tact.I haven't had any problems with being able to hear. And no issues with the touch screen. It works beautifully!!! Nice and smooth. No scratches as of yet either.My ONLY complaint so far is it has a small bubble in the left corner that doesn't lay flat on my screen. But does it REALLY matter in the scheme of things or affect use? Nope. It sure doesn't.",

It seems to do what it's meant to do, I ran it through the sink to see if water got in it and it worked. I don't go swimming nor shower with it, but I do go off-roading and the elements seem to get the phone wet or dirty. This would help keep the phone looking new and add an additional layer of waterproof. Keep in mind that the A53 5G is already water resistant but having an extra layer of security gives me more piece of mind. I recommend this case if you are in areas were your phone could end up getting wet or dirty like outdoors.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for a new phone, liked the fact that it had a screen protector and was waterproof.1st thing the case was difficult to install phone in due to the waterproof fit (almost gave up trying to install thought I might break something).When phone was in case it did not receive text messages or phone calls. Used for 2 days----thought something is off---no calls--no texts for 2 days.Could not get codes for verification to online accounts (Amazon included). What is different from the last 2 weeks of using this new phone?----the case !Removed phone from case and the \"Flood Gates\" opened-- 32 text messages and several missed calls immediately came through.Why?What caused the phone to not work while it was in this case?A mystery without any Clues.Returned for a refund",
