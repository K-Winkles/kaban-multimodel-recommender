The texture is a little slippery. It's not great, but it is fine. This case fits my Galaxy A71 5G phone perfectly. The buttons line up perfectly. The case is easy to put on and remove.I see a lot of people in these reviews who are confused about which phone this case will fit, and which phone they own. This case fits only A71 5G phones. If there are different or extra letters or numbers in your phone's Pruduct Name, no amount of wishful thinking is going to make this case fit your phone. Check what kind of phone you have by going to Settings (the little gear icon in your main pull-down menu at the top of your phone), then scroll all the way down and tap on About Phone. In About Phone, the information your need to pick a phone case that will fit is next to \"Product name\".",
