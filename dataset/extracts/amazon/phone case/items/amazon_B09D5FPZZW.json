I've dropped my phone several times and it's done it's job - no cracks.Compared to the prices of other phone cases, I don't think you can beat this. The only thing I'd say is expect to replace it after a year (at least). I've had mine for 18 months, but probably should have replaced it at 12 months.I carry my phone in my front pocket. After a few months, the rubbery parts to started to yellow. Not a huge deal, but it's worth mentioning. It also got looser at the bottom and the clear part started flaking off (not sure what caused it, but it gives it a really scratched up look). It looked bad enough that my kids starting to make comments about it, forcing me to seek a replacement! I've uploaded a picture, but remember - this is after 18 months of use.After looking at other options, I'm back and reordering this cover again. For the price, I don't think it can be beat.",

                "reviewText": "All in all, I like the case and it's done a good job of protecting my phone which is what I want. However, I do wish the inner lining and fit of the case were more durable when taking the case off and on. I wish the outer hard case had not cracked, but to be fair, I have dropped this many times and it's withstood quite a few fumbles.Important to note: I use a tempered glass screen protector as well as a camera protector on the back camera when using this case. Therefore, I cannot speak to how the case would do without these added protections. In conjunction with these other measures, the case has done a pretty decent job of protecting the phone. Many times the screen and camera protectors have cracked, and I've replaced them, but the phone has emerged undamaged.Complaints:1) After being dropped, the corners got a little jagged and the corner of the hard case broke off. However, despite the case itself cracking, my phone was fine.2) After taking the case off and on a few times, I think it could be a bit more sturdy. The inner soft lining of the case stretched out and warped so that it hangs out away from the case and doesn't fit properly. Not sure how that makes sense to be called military grade? Anyway, I feel I need to replace it now because I don't know how well it would protect my phone when the fit is now sub-par.",

                "reviewText": "This case has been great. I purchased it in February of 2022 and it is now 21 months later and still protects my phone just as well as it did when I bought it. I've dropped my phone several times and my phone hasn't been damaged at all from any of the drops. The case itself is visibly scratched only if you look at it in the right light, and one of the corners is cracked from a drop but still holds together and protects. My only issue with the case is that the silicone areas around the volume/lock and charging port are warped, detached from the plastic part of the case, and started turning yellow after about 9 months living in a place with strong uv index. I'm not sure if the issues with the silicone parts are avoidable, so the case is great.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a SIMPLE clear case for my iPhone 15 Pro and this meets my needs. It is very simple, one piece of plastic molded material that fits the phone very well. It has cutouts molded in all the right places - you can plug in a lightening charger very easy, speakers are not obstructed and buttons work fine with this cover. I have owned many OtterBox phone cases in the past and this product is consistent with the OtterBox quality I have experience with other models of their cases. There is no screen protection with this case, but I am happy to use a separate screen protector/application with this case. I would buy this agian and recommend it highly.",
