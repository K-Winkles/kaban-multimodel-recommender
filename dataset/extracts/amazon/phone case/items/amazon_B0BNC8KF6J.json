                "reviewText": "Arrived as expected. Love the metallic look, which seems high quality and not like cheap plastic. The entire case is rubbery and flexible, including the metal-colored sides, which looks great.The only problem is that there are hard plastic protective covers that go over all three camera lenses (to protect them from scratching, I guess). They get dirty and dusty easily and affect the camera quality. They were fairly easy to remove however with an Exacto knife. I just carefully cut the covers away leaving just holes in the case over the camera lenses - problem solved and you can't even tell there is a modification. The iPhone's lenses don't really scratch anyway, plus they are still recessed lower than the case, so it's highly unlikely anything would ever touch them to begin with.Will buy again!",

                "reviewText": "I ended up ordering two different cases for my new iPhone 15, not sure which one I would like more. After taking them both out, I much preferred this one. You don\u2019t have to put any adhesive on the camera lens during installation - it just lines up and protects it. I made sure to clean the camera well before installing it, and so far, the quality does not appear to be diminished.Also, I thought from the photos that the color was going to be more Kelly green, which I could live with. The actual color is a metallic green in that looks like a richer version of the pastel green on the body. It truly looks amazing.I add a MagSafe pop socket type of thing, and the connection is just as strong if not stronger than it was before I put the case on.Too early to say what kind of protection or longevity this will have. I got a $65 Kate Spade one for my iPhone XR that lasted me 4.5 years of pristine protection (although it was looking *rough* by the end). I doubt that this will be as robust, but it\u2019s also 1/3 the price, minus 5 years of inflation. I\u2019ll be well satisfied if it looks dinged up after a year and I want to get something new. If I have to replace sooner than that, I\u2019ll change my rating.",

                "reviewText": "update:The seller was extremely prompt in reaching out and worked with me on these issues by sending me another one. I opted for clear on instead of one with silver siding. The clear one does not have the issue of slippery edges and may not have issue with scuffing either. It was great working with the seller. They took time to understand my concerns and helped me resolve my issues. So up-ing the stars to 4. Thank you.------------I got clear with silver siding, looks really good and sleek. It fits well, little snug, so had to wrestle to get it in, but no issues with charger connection getting in. I like that it has mesh covers on the microphone openings. Buttons are well fit, easy operation, I don\u2019t have to press hard.2 negativesCamera cover though is not complete cover, it has 2 holes. All 3 Lenses do have complete cover.Another issue is it is little too sleek on the sides to the point of being slippery, does not have good grip, I dropped my phone twice already. I bought one in silver and one in clear at same time and both have this issue.",

                "reviewText": "I wish I had taken pictures of the packaging before I threw it away because this phone case and screen protector are packaged so well. It felt like I bought a very expensive case when I didn\u2019t! I normally don\u2019t leave reviews on things but I felt like I had to just because this is so nice. The screen protector was super easy to set up and came with everything you need (I feel like normally when you buy a screen protector it doesn\u2019t have the dust remover or an alcohol wipe and you absolutely need those). The case itself is super cute. I bought the gold one with a clear back and it even covers the camera lens and protects it. My only grievance (and this has nothing at all to do with the case) is that I can\u2019t fit my four leaf clovers on the inside of the back like I normally do. But that means the case is snug and that\u2019s what you want! Just a heads up for anyone that likes to have stickers or pictures on the back of a clear case \u25e1\u0308I would definitely like to purchase maybe another color in this case! And it works great with the mag-safe pop socket if you\u2019re thinking about one of those too.",
