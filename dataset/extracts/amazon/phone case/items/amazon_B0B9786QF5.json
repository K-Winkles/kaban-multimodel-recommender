The built in screen protector was a plus for me as I\u2019ve been looking for a case with that feature.It came with lots of instructions and different ways to access them.The only thing I don\u2019t believe it came with was a cloth to clean your phone screen beforehand.It\u2019s very easy to attach, although took me a minute to find the separation seam and realize the top part of the case is much smaller than the back.Only thing I would like also is if it came with a cover for the charger port.Also the color I ordered was not as bright as pictured, but it does extenuate the natural color of my phone pretty well.",

                "reviewText": "Nice and durable, looks great and very reasonably priced too.I don\u2019t like cases where there\u2019s no screen protector and you have to buy a separate protector that sticks on and can\u2019t be removed.I picked this one because it\u2019s two separate pieces that protect the front and back and it can be disassembled, cleaned, and put back together easily. But it protects the phone well also.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the rubber edge that holds the whole thing together has a bit of a ridge to it, just enough that if you lay the phone it doesn\u2019t sit flush with a flat surface. If you have a wireless charger that\u2019s wider than the phone itself it\u2019s not gonna charge. If you have one that\u2019s magnetic and stick to the phone, or a car charger that holds it in place you\u2019ll be fine, it\u2019ll charge through the back cover no problem. But it does NOT lay flat. So if you have a charger that requires contact with the back of the phone it\u2019s not gonna work with this case.",

The only thing have an issue with is it gets dirty really easy underneath of the screen protector and it is kind of hard to take back off your phone to be able to clean it. I wish it was waterproof. That way all the holes would be covered and dust wouldn\u2019t get underneath of the screen like it does. But other than that it\u2019s a great case I still have it on my phone because it\u2019s really cute and I\u2019ve dropped my phone and it\u2019s protected it.",
