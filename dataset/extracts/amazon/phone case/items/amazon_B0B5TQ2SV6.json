                "reviewText": "I was looking for a thinner case to protect my new iPhone 12 Pro Max. A lot of the the thin cases look nice but don\u2019t feel good in the hand for prolonged calls or viewing of the screen and most don\u2019t offer drop protection. This case is a nice balance of thinness, sturdiness, and aesthetic. The blue color of this case matches nicely with the pacific blue iPhone. All the cutouts match up perfectly and the buttons have a nice response. Kudos to Torras for including neon yellow and orange buttons for this case. I may never use them but if I decide I want a change they\u2019re available. The back of the case has a nice translucent black/grey back more towards charcoal grey. In regular room lighting I can just barely make out the apple logo. In sunlight you can see the apple logo through the back. Either way if you\u2019re buying this to see your phonles blue through the back look elsewhere. It\u2019s not a deal breaker for me and I kind of like that it takes on a different identity in different lighting. Now how this case feels is in another league of its own. I have tried cases from other brands and one twice what I payed for this case and it doesn\u2019t feel as nice as this one does. It has the flat edges like the iPhone and is easy to hold. Decent grip and not too slippery like some have complained about. I think it feels great and it has a nice soft touch to it that is addicting to feel. You have to try it and see what I mean. Feels like silk. Lol. As for durability it looks like it can stand up to some abuse but only time will tell. As I use this case over the coming weeks I will adjust my rating accordingly. Right now I\u2019ll give it a 4 for durability based on the rigid ness of the case. Lastly the there\u2019s a decent lip around the phone and camera for protection and the case is easy on and easy off but fits snug so there\u2019s no bulging out on the sides or anywhere on the phone. Drop protection should be good for medium drops. Love the blue/ grey contrast and out of 5 cases I tried on this phone this one is my favorite. Torras is a new brand to me and if the case holds up I will be buying for this and future phones. Great price to quality ratio. Hope this helps everyone.",

After using it for a few weeks, I can confidently say that this phone case is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to protect their phone.Something I appreciate about this phone case is that it doesn't add too much bulk to my phone. It fits snugly and doesn't interfere with any of the ports or buttons. I can still access everything I need on my phone without having to take the case off.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. This phone case offers excellent protection, a stylish design, and a comfortable grip, all at an affordable price. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality phone case.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m very impressed by this iPhone case. The texture and feel is great. It honestly makes you enjoy touching your phone. The raised protection of your camera is perfect. Set your phone down on a table and the camera lenses are safe from scratches and damage. I do suggest getting a camera protector for protection in your pocket or purse.The design is perfect. It\u2019s sleek and slim so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re holding an iPhone 14 Plus in your hands that\u2019s .6 inches larger than the iPhone 14. We either buy a Max or Plus for a larger phone/screen size. Cases can add to what we did not want: a large phone. This case does not do that. You really have no idea it\u2019s there until you touch it. And as I said before, the feel and silicone texture of this case makes for a great feeling phone.As for the replacement buttons, I was very impressed by the ease of replacement and how well they fit. I thought these buttons were going to be the usual colored stickers. They\u2019re actually very responsive and sturdy buttons you can interchange easily. Only thing I ask is if TORRAS has different color buttons besides yellow and red.Overall, after ordering 6 of the highly rated iPhone 14 cases, this one took the number 1 spot.",

Auch der Rand um das Kameramodul ist glatt.Dabei ist die H\u00fclle nicht rutschig, sondern fasst sich sehr angenehm und griffig an.Die Transparenz ist super. Fingerabdr\u00fccke lassen sich, wie bei klaren H\u00fcllen meist der Fall, nicht vermeiden.Ganz eben liegt das iPhone nicht auf dem Tisch (der Kamerabuckel, leider). Dieses Problem werden die meisten H\u00fcllen haben.Klar, die H\u00fclle ist neu. Muss ich sehen, wie das in einem Jahr aussieht.Zusammengefasst:Ein perfekte, d\u00fcnne Schutzh\u00fclle, mit der das Handy angenehm und sicher in der Hand liegt, nach wie vor gut aussieht und problemlos bedient und geladen werden kann.",

I have been a loyal customer of Torras since I had the iPhone 11 and have bought their cases for my iPhone 11, 12 pro, and 13 pro in the past. Not only is the quality excellent, the customer service is excellent as well. I definitely recommend you to buy this case and be a Torras customer!",
