                "reviewText": "I have had and used this case for a couple of weeks now and thought I would write a review. I will start with the cons, and then the pros. It has a better feel for grip on the inside than on the outside of the case. It is far more slick and plastic feel that doesn't grip to your hand very well. As you can see in the photo it gets quite a bit of dirt and debris in the inside edge of where it seals from the back. It is far from water proof, although it should protect from rain penetration. I have yet to be using it at all when raining and haven't gotten it the least bit wet. The side buttons for power and up/down volume are stiff as a rock, no click thru feel at all, although it works fairly easily to activate the buttons you wish, you can't feel what your doing with them. I notice it gets dirt and dust under the top where self camera is just below speaker opening, but I guess this is unavoidable. Now the pros. The front having the screen protector built in is probably the best feature. This seals from water intrusion around front sides of phone which is a very good thing, and keeps from having to buy a screen protector. All access points for phone are in perfect alignment and very well designed. Front screen cover does have that plastic feel to it but functions perfectly fine. It is very easy to put on/take off when desired. Over all I feel it deserves a 4 star rating. For it's price and features I do recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty sturdy case. Easy to install and protects the phone perfectly. Even though the actual phone is a POS. However, I digress. This did a commendable job of protecting my phone from my cat's claw.You are probably wondering why I didn't give it 5 stars and that is because it gets way too dirty on the inside surprisingly. So you often have to take it apart to clean it. Other than that, I recommend this case for sure.",

                "reviewText": "The case is protective fits well, and the phone is relatively easy to remove. The big flaw is the plastic, transparent, screen protector. I'm 81 and my fingerprints barely register (not useful for bio ID) but they manage to easily smudge the protector. It also scratches very easily and makes touch movements unresponsive to some extent, that seems to vary in different apps or different targets in the same app. I have considered removing the protector to get less smudging and more responsive touches.",
