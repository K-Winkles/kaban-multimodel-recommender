Once I found where to check though, it didn't matter. Really good case.",

                "reviewText": "So I own both an iPad and an iPhone \u2026. they work for me. Because I have an iPad for most of my big screen stuff, keep my iPhones till they typically stop doing updates for that model phone. Last November my ancient iPhone went belly up and I got a new one with this case.- The case is functional and does protect the phone. Nice!- The slightly raised bevel around the phone prevents the glass from scratching when you place the phone down but doesn\u2019t protect the glass if you put the phone in you pocket with your keys.- The card holder in the back is slightly recessed and has a rubberized bottom of the holder. Two cards work great! Three cards - not so much as the top card often slides out with the sliding cover beginning a 30 second struggle to get the top card.- the case was not very robust though. I dropped it one to many times and fractured the case.The case lasted 11 months. I\u2019m going to look for a new case for my next case.",

However, you get used to it very quickly and isn\u2019t an issueThe sliding door \u201clocks\u201d into place with a snap. It isn\u2019t perfect as I\u2019ve seen it unsnap by my handling coming out of my pocket. Never in fear of losing my cards (to date I haven\u2019t dropped it, so I can\u2019t comment on it)In the pocket it\u2019s as slim as a wallet/case combo design can be imo. It\u2019s comfyIt charged with ALL my different wireless chargers I have with the case full of cardsI can easily hold 2 CC\u2019s and one ID. However, if I cut out the rubber insulator behind the case, I can easily add 2 more without losing functionalityFor the price\u2026this fits the bill and is worth the purchaseLike I wrote in the beginning. If I had a gripe\u2026it would be the buttons. They don\u2019t protrude enough, but again, you get used to it",
