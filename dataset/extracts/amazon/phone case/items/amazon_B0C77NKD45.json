I'm not too particular to any brands so when I saw the styling of this one I quite liked it. I ordered it, it came one day early, and I was quite happy with my purchase. The rubber sides don't have too much grip where you can't comfortably pull your phone out of your pocket or slide it in, but there is enough to hold it without worry of dropping it or having it slip. The camera bump leaves a generous amount of room for the cameras, so placing it down on a table or any flat surfaces doesn't have you concerned if you're scraping the camera lenses.Overall the durability of it is nice, I dropped my phone (not on purpose, mind you) a few times and every time the case absorbs the energy and the phone is fine. I'd highly recommend this case for the value, and the style.",

The green matches my green iphone 13 mini. The camera lenses are also protected by the lip of the case. The case doesn't fit flush in the front leaving enough room for protection - as in if you drop it, the glass is protected. I have dropped my phone a couple of times since receiving and my phone is still in perfect condition. I do have a screen protector. I feel like this case will last for awhile - especially for the price.",

This case was nicely priced and understated, which I like. It\u2019s a nice snug fit and is raised in all the right places so as to offer really good protection, but is not too bulky. I am using it on an iPhone 13 Mini. I use the Mini because small size is one of the most important things about the phone to me. When I put it in this case, I realized how bulky the other one was. I drop my phone a lot and this one does just as good a job protecting it. It\u2019s exceeded my expectations, I\u2019m very pleased with it.",

This is the second one I got because the first one didn\u2019t hold either. It also gets very dirty looking maybe because of the color I chose but it seems overall not worth the monry",
