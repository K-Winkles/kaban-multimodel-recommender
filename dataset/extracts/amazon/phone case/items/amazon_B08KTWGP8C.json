Color stayed true, very shock absorbent (even after several drops) due to the rubber all around the edges which extends further on the top and bottom, card holder door slides easily and holds my license and debit card very securely. When I got an updated iPhone, I went straight to this brand and ordered the same one I had previously and it did not disappoint. I added a tempered glass screen saver for extra protection. Would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 3rd case to purchase. Had to replace the first one simply because I purchased a newer and larger phone, so I needed a larger case. I made this purchase because of 2 reasons: 1. my current case is showing wear and I just want a fresher look. I keep it in my back jeans pocket or in my side pocket of my leggings so I am always rubbing the finish against material. It is holding up quite well actually but it is a little dull and has a few scuffs from dropping it, but all in all still in good shape after 3 years. 2. I recently dropped it not once but twice consecutively - I kept missing the door pocket one evening and it kept falling on the asphalt on the same corner of the case. A tiny piece broke off that is not in any way impairing the function or look of the case. Again, it is just my tickyness. I get compliments all the time and people as where I purchased it. My hubs uses the same case and loves it as well. I just love the convenience of not having to lug my wallet or purse with me to run into the store. My heart does skip a beat when I cannot find my phone since it has my ID and my business credit card as well as personal credit card. I am a repeat customer indefinitely!!",
