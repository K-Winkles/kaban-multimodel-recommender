The case itself is durable but has no glass or plastic transparent cover for the front, leaving the screen itself exposed to the elements. Reading some of the seller reviews leads me to think none of their covers do but then again, the phones that fit these cases aren't terribly expensive either.The case itself is made well but the phone for which this case is made for is comprised of cheap plastic. It's a cheap phone. The case holds on to the phone so well that when I take the phone out, the phone detaches from it's back cover which is stuck inside this case and very difficult to remove. For the T430W/T607DL phones, I recommend buying a cover that opens and seals from the side of the phone so that the phone can be easily removed from its case. Negligent design for those reasons.",
