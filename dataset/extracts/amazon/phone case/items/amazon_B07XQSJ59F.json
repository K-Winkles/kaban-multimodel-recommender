If you\u2019re debating, I would recommend you get it.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Apple cases exclusively ever since it first released, starting with the leather case and now the silicon one. They fit perfectly, as they should since its designed by the OG company. The buttons are buttery smooth. The case is super thin and low profile, but super durable. The only time I have ever broken the screen on my phone is when I decided to switch cases to another random brand since my old Apple case was used for way too long. I dropped it once and my phone screen was shattered. After that I never used any other case than Apple cases. A bit pricey, but you're paying for the logo and the quality.",
