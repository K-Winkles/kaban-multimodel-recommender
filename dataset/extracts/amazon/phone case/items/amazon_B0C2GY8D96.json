                "reviewText": "iPhone 12 ProCan\u2019t believe how attractive this MagSafe case is given the price. I\u2019ve bought budget cases in the past and this far exceeds all of them. Id imagine there are cases like this hanging in the Apple Store. The magnetism to my car mount is perfect and very sturdy. Camera is protected by an additional raised surround that although noticeable isn\u2019t annoying. There is a slight raised lip around the face of the phone too that isn\u2019t quite as substantial as the Otterbox it is replacing while waiting on my replacement through their support. While attractive this is not a phone vault. It should slide in and out of pockets with ease. The price outweighs the negatives which feels more like nitpicking.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item because my iPhone 12 would not remain connected to my Honda's CRV's wireless phone charger. The least motion would disengage the charging. Although new, two trips, the MagSafe case has allowed the phone to remain in the charging mode. Major improvement. The case is thin, fits well, but for durability I am unsure. I did like my other case a bit better, however, the MagSafe case fits well into my phone holster and seems to work with all my wireless charging devices. Would recommend.",
