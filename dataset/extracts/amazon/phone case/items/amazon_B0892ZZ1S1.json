The plastic hard back is not durable and i have pieces chipping away as well as cracks forming huge holes around the edges and especially the charging port. I had to re attach the finger ring and kickstand with superglue as it fell off within a month. I should also mention the hard back is peeling away its color slowly and the whole thing looks like it fell off a truck after not even 6 months of use.",

                "reviewText": "(Midnight Green Color) --The case is well made and looks great, but there are 2 issues they should improve on and or maybe they have considering this phone is discontinued and the company is no longer producing cell phones..... #1--Needs more texture for better grip......#2--The case should come apart easier making it easier to wirelessly charge phone as with second part of the cover needs to be removed for wireless charging.....This are my suggestions and the reason for 3-Stars.....Fix the issues would have been 5-Star...!!",
