I LOVE having my cards in the back of my phone because I don\u2019t like having a purse at all.The case has lasted me 1.5 years before the plastic on the back broke (mostly because I keep dropping it). I\u2019m reordering myself the same exact one. For $18, it\u2019s done well for me.",

The plastic strip has cracked on the top where the case slides open so now I can\u2019t use it. It is a new design and less durable. Only lasted 3.5 months and I am not rough on my phone. Reasonable price for the case and protects the phone well. Will buy one more time but will need to switch cases if the next one doesn\u2019t last!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Solid Phone Case",
                "reviewText": "I am a bit particular when it comes to phone cases. It has to look good, be protective, have buttons that \"click\" properly when actuated and it cannot be bulky. All of this and I also wanted a case that holds two cards along with my driver's registration and insurance information. It would seem that all of this is a pretty tall order. This case, overall, is quite good. The looks of the case are quite pleasing. It is sharp enough to work both in a professional setting and in a more casual environment. I particularly appreciate that it does not scream \"I AM A CREDIT CARD CASE\" to potential thieves. The case also seems to be quite protective and rugged, featuring a solid bumper that not only protects the edges but also provides a lip for the screen and camera lenses. Thankfully, I have yet to actually put this case to the test in that department. The attribute that I am most impressed with about the case is its buttons. It seems that the vast majority of phone case manufacturers get the buttons wrong. They are often either too hard to press or provide too little feedback (or both). The buttons on this case are excellent, providing a nice click response while also being easy (but not too easy) to actuate. I am also pleased by the dimensions of this case. Some competing cases are so bulky that they are hard to put into a pocket and if one does manage to get it in, it looks like a growth on their thigh. This case keeps the bulk to a minimum while still providing enough space for two credit cards and some paper insurance and registration information. The only problem of any note that I have with this case is the sliding door that provides access to the cards. It is rather cheap feeling and I question how long it will last. I wish Spigen had used a slightly more premium material for this door since my had is constantly in contact with it when I am using the phone. Otherwise, I very much recommend this case.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Spigen case. The only reason I replaced is because I got a new phone and old one didn't fit. Both cases have been dropped numerous times with no damage to phone. I LOVE the card carrier on the back. I no longer carry a purse when I go shopping. Just stick my phone in my pocket and I can go about my business without having to watch for theft.",

                "reviewText": "Where do I start? This is a great sturdy case for Iphone Pro 13. Spigen has never let me down. I've dropped my phone in the past with previous case model and it protected my phone from damages each time. I became a loyal fan since then.Pros:- The case fits the phone perfectly, buttons work flawlessly, no issues with camera.- Phone is now stable when laying flat on table, not wobbly like it was without case- I like the ribbed texture at the top, gives it an unique design.- Does charge wirelessly with Yootech Wireless Charger,Qi-Certified 10W Max Fast Wireless Charging Pad.- I glued the magnet at bottom to avoid disruption with charging and works with my magnetic car phone holder, no issues with charging either.- I absolutely despise thick, bulky case but this Spigen case is perfect in terms of thickness.Cons:- Does take PATIENCE with wireless charging! It is extremely nitpicky about placement and you have to move it around to find the \"spot\" where it will charge wirelessly (usually in center below camera). It will take several attempts but once you figure it out, it becomes less of a hassle over time.- Less space in card slot than previous model. I am able to get 1 ID, 1 Credit Card in, maybe 2 Credit Cards if it's completely flat on both sides.- Disappointed by lack of colors. I loved the sierra blue case Spigen offered, but didn't have the card slot. It would be 5 stars if Spigen was able to combine both.I hope Spigen does not eliminate the case with the hidden card slot. I love the fact that I can hide my ID/Credit cards and no one really knows. I am not a fan of the removable magnetic wallet that is gaining popularity these days. In conclusion, you have to decide for yourself. Are you dead-set on wireless charging and do you have patience? You can plug it in at the bottom if you needed to. If you have no patience and want to wirelessly charge the phone in a second, this case will not suit your needs. If you don't care about wireless charging, this phone case is durable, versatile (if you need to be creative with it), perfect to hide cards. It fulfilled my needs and I love it.",
