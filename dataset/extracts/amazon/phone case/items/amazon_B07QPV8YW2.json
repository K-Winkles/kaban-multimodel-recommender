                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the JETech Case for my iPhone 11, 6.1-Inch, and it has been a solid addition to my daily tech gear. After using it for a few weeks, I'm ready to give it a well-deserved 4-star review.The case's non-yellowing feature is one of its standout attributes. It's quite refreshing to see a case that maintains its clarity and doesn't succumb to the discoloration that plagues so many clear cases over time. My iPhone still looks as pristine as it did the day I bought it, and I appreciate being able to show off its original color without any tint from the case.I am also impressed with the case's shockproof capabilities. The phone bumper cover provides a reassuring layer of protection without adding unnecessary bulk. I've accidentally dropped my phone a couple of times, and thanks to the JETech Case, it came out unscathed, without a scratch. This level of protection gives me confidence that my device is safe in everyday scenarios.The anti-scratch feature has held up well. I'm not gentle with my phone; it often gets tossed into a bag with keys and coins, but the case has remained remarkably scratch-free. This durability is a testament to the quality of the materials used and the thoughtful design.However, the case is not without its minor drawbacks, hence the 4-star rating. While the case offers robust protection for the back and sides of the phone, I feel it could offer a slightly raised edge to provide extra security for the screen. As someone who prefers not to use a screen protector, having that additional buffer would make a huge difference.Also, while the case fits the iPhone 11 quite well, the buttons can be a bit stiff to press. They do require a firmer push than I'd like, which took some getting used to. While this isn't a deal-breaker by any means, there is room for improvement in making the case as user-friendly as possible.In conclusion, the JETech Case for iPhone 11, 6.1-Inch, is a reliable and efficient product that offers excellent protection and durability. Its clear, non-yellowing material and shockproof design are features that any iPhone user would appreciate. With a few minor tweaks to the button sensitivity and screen edge protection, it could easily be a 5-star case. Nevertheless, it's a solid purchase that I would recommend to others in need of a dependable phone case.",

                "reviewText": "So far, I love everything about this case. It is strong, it shows off my cute phone color, and most of all it has protected my phone from many accidental falls already! It doesn't get greasy or show finger prints as easily as some of my other clear phone cases have in the past. And it is still showing no signs of yellowing! I give this a 10/10 , and if I ever need a clear case again, I'll be getting this one!",
