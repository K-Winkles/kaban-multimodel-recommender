                "reviewText": "I bought the ivory colored case and I know it\u2019s bound to get dirty. But I loveeee the feel of this case. If you like the soft rubbery type of silicone that\u2019s exactly what this is. It feels just like an apple brand phone case but softer silicone in some areas which I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s heavy and has good grip. Absolutely worth it. The interior is identical to apples as well. You can\u2019t beat the price. Came within a reasonable time frame too. I love the squared off edges and it really makes my phone look beautiful and simple. Great buy!",

It\u2019s super soft and you can\u2019t see that big circle on the back like other mag safe cases. The inside is velvety soft to protect your phone in that way also. It\u2019s full coverage and is raised around the camera lenses as well to protect them. Will definitely be ordering more in different colors. Also mine is the deep purple but looks blue in the pic for some reason. It\u2019s a bright rich beautiful purple though!!!",

Nice feeling and would have been nice had it fit! Love the color and idea and concept but like def miss. I don\u2019t even care to take a pic i should have trust the other reviews that state it\u2019s not for iPhone 12 but bc i could select iPhone 12 I believed it and nope! Not iPhone 12",
