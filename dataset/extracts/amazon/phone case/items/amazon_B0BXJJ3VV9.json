Because the Nothing Phone 1 is slippery, I wanted a case for my mother's/stepfathers phones that would help her hold on to it, but also keep it in her color wheel. Both my mother & I agree that it looks more pink than purple, but, that was good by her standards. The blue one we got for my stepfather was perfect.Fitment is great, I don't know about the front glass that comes with it, I don't use them for I have always used either Mr.Shield or Rhinoshield for my screen protector glass. Also, I really dislike the black border that comes on that glass, so my rating only on this product is just for the case, and not the front glass.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes it can be hard to find a case in a color and design I appreciate.The good:-Nice color-The case fits the nothing phone 1 well-I believe its nylon or acrylic backing, some different type of material is the clear section, and the side blue section is more rubbery and feels good in your hand.-The screen protector is made from high-quality glass and feels good on the fingers.The bad:-Very likely that this case will yellow on the rubbery sides. I have 2 other cases that feel exactly the same as this, and both have yellowed with UV exposure. Fortunatly the less flexible back plate is unlikely to yellow as it is a different material. I will update this review if I notice this case behave differently-The volume buttons and lock button are not pronounced on the side of the case and it can be hard to identify where volume and power is when you want to operate the phone while its still in your pocket.-The screen protector was designed for another phone, or was designed by someone who just had dimensions for the nothing phone virtually rather than in hand. The fillet on the corners is not the same radius as the screen, and there is a black border around the entire protector which will cut off the last couple of pixels on your screen even if you place it EXACTLY perfect.Overall, this is not the right phone case to choose UNLESS you really like this particular color, which I happen to be fond of.",

I was concerned that it was used but it seems almost like it is a manufacturing defect when making the case. The back portion has marks permanently scratched into it and really it doesn't look the best. What I do appreciate is the glass screen protector. It blends in seamlessly with the phone.Overall, this isn't the best case out there. You can definitely find much better.",
