                "reviewText": "Let's start with the negatives. The color part of the casing is a bit questionable. It isn't made of some silicone or hard rubber, it's just hard plastic snapped on another plastic mold. So don't be fooled by the grip looking texture of the case, those grooves can't do much if the material is just some slippery plastic and trust me, I've had this slide around tables with a slight push and slip off my lap with minor movements more times than I can remember. It's weird because sometimes I feel like my screen actually grips slightly better than this case. Also, the plastic part is pretty flimsy where it molds around the camera. I've already had the colored plastic part Crack and snap off where it's at its thinnest. Luckily, the inner layer of the case that actually covers the phone is still intact.So the positives. So far it does its main job fairly well which is protecting the phone assuming it isn't falling screen first of course. And I've had plenty of testing with that since this thing loves sliding around; granted you probably wouldn't want that happening to begin with but hey, this case has something to prove I guess *shrugs*. The side buttons are pretty good and are easy to identify blind and push. And the holes for the USB slot and sound are fine. Also the size is good, so you won't have to worry about your phone feeling like its a brick in your pocket.Honestly, if they made this out of material that gripped better and had more flexibility, this case would probably be one of the best minimalistic cases on the market. But again, it does it's job.",
