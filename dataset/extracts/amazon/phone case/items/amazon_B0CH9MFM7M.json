                "reviewText": "The phone seemed great - works well with wi-fi calling. Unfortunately, when I left the house I discovered it wasn't working on cellular! Their endorsement stated that it did work with Consumer Cellular but being a novice when it comes to cell phones I never thought there was a problem since the phone worked great with wi-fi. Consumer Cellular worked with me for over an hour trying to help connect and finally gave up. TCL was my next contact - quick contact - the troubleshooter said if Consumer Cellular couldn't help me there was nothing he could do. Naturally, I commented that the description showed Consumer Cellular which he said it's basically verbiage used in their description.It seems like a great phone just be aware that their products may or may not work with carriers shown. The phone I purchased stated work with GSM no carriers mentioned. Since my first attempt stated it worked with CC I decided might as well try it. It Worked!! I can't recommend the TCL 40 XE but I also can't say it's a bad phone. Just know you may have a 50/50 chance of it working with the carriers shown.",
