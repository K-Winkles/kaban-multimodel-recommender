                "reviewText": "I love the case! I am someone that wears glasses and literally cannot see so I love that I was able to get a very bright color that I know I will be able to spot out immediately in the morning when I can\u2019t find my glasses. Another thing is that this case is very solid in structure! It holds in my phone and wasn\u2019t as easy as I expected when it came to actually putting it on my phone, it hugs the phone VERY nicely and it makes it seem more durable to me, especially for a silicone case. Something else is that it has this lining on the inside of the phone that\u2019s super soft for shock absorption that I felt was nifty for a case at this price point! Overall, I love the simple design, the elements of protection that are involved, and the color! It\u2019s also so soft to touch and NO FINGERPRINTS!!!! Even with the neon yellow color I chose, I\u2019ve been wearing it in my jeans back pocket and there have been no transfers of color or anything like that either which I feel is important to note! I highly recommend y\u2019all try this out if you\u2019re looking for a higher quality affordable option in your phone case",

I love that this phone case seamlessly combines durability, sleek design, and a comfortable grip, while still looking great and offering impressive protection with a luxurious feel.Off the bat, I was immediately impressed by its durability \u2013 It's a thin flexible case that's reinforced to absorb and shock from accidental drops, which happened a couple of times. I accidentally dropped it from about 5 feet and it was unscathed. The design strikes a perfect balance between sleek and sturdy, providing top-notch protection without compromising on aesthetics. The smooth texture feels luxurious to the touch, and the case's minimalistic look adds a touch of sophistication. Additionally, it's comfortable to hold and grip easily without slipping because of its smooth texture. It's also important to note that the case effectively covers the volume and lock buttons without limiting their function and it leaves the charging port uncovered.Overall great phone, I'd highly recommend this to anyone in search of a reliable, durable, and aesthetically pleasing phone case!",

                "reviewText": "This semi-rigid rubber protects phone well while not adding bulk to the size of the phone. The surface is grippy as rubber, so even though it may not slide in and out of your pocket the easiest, you won't drop your phone. The material is soft enough to dampen impact when the phone is dropped on its corners, which usually results in a broke screen for an unprotected phone. I liked the bright yellow color, which makes it easy to spot from across the room. The buttons on the phone work well through this cover",

                "reviewText": "The OTOFLY Soft Silicone iPhone 12/12 Pro Case has proven to be a reliable and durable option for protecting my precious device. Its blend of military-grade drop protection and slim, sleek design makes it an appealing choice for everyday use.The first thing that caught my attention was the stone color option. It offers a unique and stylish look that complements the sleek design of the iPhone 12/12 Pro perfectly. The soft silicone material feels smooth to the touch and provides a comfortable grip, making it easy to handle the phone without worrying about accidental slips.The military-grade drop protection is no exaggeration. This case has done an excellent job of safeguarding my phone from accidental drops and bumps. The raised edges around the screen and camera offer additional protection, ensuring that these vulnerable areas are shielded from direct impact.The microfiber lining inside the case is a thoughtful addition, preventing scratches on the phone's back and maintaining its pristine appearance. The snug fit of the case ensures that it stays in place securely without adding unnecessary bulk to the phone.The slim and thin design of the case is a standout feature for me. It maintains the phone's original form factor, making it easy to slide into pockets and bags without feeling overly bulky. This minimalist approach is something I appreciate, as I prefer cases that don't compromise the phone's slim profile.One minor drawback is that the soft silicone material can attract lint and dust over time, especially in darker color options like stone. Regular cleaning or using a lint roller can help keep the case looking clean and fresh.While this case offers good protection against everyday wear and tear, it may not be the best option for extreme outdoor activities or rugged environments. If you are someone who engages in rough outdoor activities frequently, you may want to consider a more heavy-duty case.Overall, the OTOFLY Soft Silicone iPhone 12/12 Pro Case strikes a balance between protection and style. It provides reliable drop protection while maintaining a slim and sleek appearance. The stone color option adds a touch of elegance to the phone, and the microfiber lining ensures that it stays scratch-free. For daily use and moderate protection, this case is an excellent choice, and I am pleased with my purchase. Four stars for a solid, well-designed protective phone case.",

I wanted a solid yellow case that wasn't too mustard but wasn't too light either. This color was spot on to what I wanted. The silicone felt nice in my hand, it wasn't slippery and the silicone is soft to the touch. It's sleek and really hugs my phone. I love that the matte finish doesn't leave any finger prints. The inside of the case has a lining that keeps my phone snug and secure. You can really feels like a good quality phone case. If you're looking for a good quality phone case that isn't going to break the bank, I totally recommend OTOFLY's liquid silicone case.",
