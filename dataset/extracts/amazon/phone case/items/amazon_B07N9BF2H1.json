                "reviewText": "This protective case from OtterBox is very durable and functional. I have dropped my phone countless times on different kinds of surfaces and had absolutely zero damage to the phone. The buttons on the side work great and the fit of the case is very precise so no undue effort is needed to activate the actual phone buttons.I have only two minor issues, neither of which I judge to be significant enough to subtract any stars. One, the part that allows the phone to rotate on the belt clip part can be a little bit loose so the phone (in the belt clip part) wiggles a little. It is secure and not in danger of falling, but just a little annoying sometimes. Two, the little flap that covers the charging port on the bottom eventually wore out on my first one (probably after two years or so) and became unattached. I don't feel this is a design flaw or fault in manufacturing, but more likely a function of overuse. I probably keep my phone (and thus the case) longer than most, so I didn't subtract any stars for the little tab breaking off.Overall I am very pleased with this product, would highly recommend, and in fact like it so much I'm on my second one for the same phone (first case lasted at least two years). I have also had other OtterBox Defender cases for other models of Samsung Galaxy phones and have been equally pleased with them.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 2nd case for the same phone in 4 years. For the case to last that long, and to protect the same phone for that long is impressive. Especially since my phone has been dropped or thrown almost everyday with 2 young kids around. It's obviously bulkier and heavier than other cases but to me the protection and not replacing a phone is worth it. Even with the case it fits in my legging pockets so that's a plus.",

                "reviewText": "This was purchased for a new Samsung S10E phone. I wanted this model because the smaller size would fit more easily in a pocket or jogging belt. Since I had recently cracked my screen on a larger note plus phone, I wanted the maximum possible protection. This case consists of a two piece snap together inner shell of hard polycarbonate plastic, and a rubberized non-slip outer cushion layer that stretches over the inside shell. It was very easy to assemble, and fairly easy to disassemble. For other covers I sometimes feel like I am risking damage trying to force the stretch cover around the edges. With this otterbox the phone is placed easily into the hard plastic case which snaps locked, and then the case, rather than the actual phone, is pushed into the stretchy outer layer. The phone feels secure and snug inside the multiple layers. The usb and earphone port are covered by hinged flaps that stay securely closed but are a little hard to open. I expect that they will tear off eventually.The case increases the size and weight of the phone by a massive amount. The phone itself is .31 inches thick x 2.75 inches wide x 5.6 inches long, and weighs 5.6 oz. The case with the phone inside is .6 inches thick x 3.3 inches wide x 6.1 inches long, and weighs in at a whopping 8 oz. That is the price you pay for extreme protection.Despite the size and weight, the entombed phone seems well balanced and is easy to hold. One handed use is pretty difficult.This case previously came with a screen protector, but this version did not. So you will need to purchase one if you need it. The S10E phone ships with a film screen protector installed, but this started to bubble up with the first use and will take something more substantial to meet my needs.The fingerprint sensor is on the power button and has an opening for access. This works ok but sometimes takes a few tries to read properly. It is about as well protected as it can be and still be usable. The other buttons are fully covered by the case.The price at Amazon was $17.75. The price at Best Buy would be $60.This case is excellent for its purpose, which is to provide maximum physical protection for the phone (no screen protector though). This adds bulk and weight which may be undesirable",
