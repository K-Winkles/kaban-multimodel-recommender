I needed a case to replace my most recent one though and as I plan on getting a new phone soon, I didn\u2019t want to invest in a $60 case for just a few months. This one is really, really nice for a replacement! The color (lake green) is so pretty and the case feels nice while holding it. I do wish it was more grippy on the sides like my Casetify case as I could see it slipping out of my grasp while holding it. Otherwise though, it fits perfectly and the sides come up just enough to protect the edges. Definitely happy with it and honestly, would buy it again. I miss the design of a Casetify Case, but I do like that this case is smooth and I could throw on a few stickers of my own choosing if I wanted to.",

Doesn\u2019t seem that slippery but a nice grip actually. The colors are super simple and cute. Pictures are of the Patina Green color. It\u2019s the same color as the manufacturer photos like a sage or mint green. Raised edges around the camera (a must), and a slight raise around the whole screen. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen protector for like $6-$12 when using this case. I wouldn\u2019t want to drop this on a rock but overall seems pretty durable to survive a fall to the floor. Because of the silicone grip it doesn\u2019t slide as easily in and out of my pocket as my hard plastic case before. Note: The box it came in was not sealed and looked like it might have been a return but was not used. The outer plastic cover for the case was not on but crumpled up and pushed to the bottom of the packaging. Didn\u2019t really mater though as it still seems new. Overall it\u2019s a win.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good cut. There\u2019s a nice lip to cover the front and back. It doesn\u2019t feel like silicone. Hard silicone maybe. Feels a bit plastic. Not much grip so it won\u2019t attract dusks. Very clean minimalist look. My iPhone is glass so I\u2019m not sure it will protect if dropped since the case is hard silicone type. It will protect from scratch small stuff like that but a drop is not advisable.",
