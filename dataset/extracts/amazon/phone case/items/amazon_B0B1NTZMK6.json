This is a good quality case that does a good job in protecting my phone. I like the raised lips on both sides that protect the camera lenses as well as the screen. I have dropped the phone a couple of times on concrete, and outside of the screen protector cracking, no damage has been delivered to the phone. The case shoes no signs of wear in a years worth of use. It cleans easily, and even when it's not clean, its not slippery and hard to hold like others. The one thing I cannot comment on is the ability to use this with wireless charging. It does not work on my wireless charger at home, but I have a friend who uses this exact model and has had no problems using his wireless charger in his car. Not sure what the difference is, but it is something to check out.",

                "reviewText": "The Spigen Ultra Hybrid Navy Blue case for the iPhone 14 (2022) is a stylish and durable option for protecting your phone. The case fits the phone perfectly, with precise cutouts for the camera, ports, and buttons. The navy blue color is vibrant and adds a nice touch of personality to your device.One of the best features of this case is its durability. The hybrid construction combines a hard polycarbonate back with a flexible TPU bumper that provides excellent shock absorption. The raised bezels around the camera and screen also help protect against scratches and drops.The case is also slim and lightweight, which means it won't add unnecessary bulk to your phone. It feels great in the hand and provides a secure grip. Additionally, it's easy to install and remove.Overall, I would highly recommend the Spigen Ultra Hybrid Navy Blue case for the iPhone 14 (2022). It offers a great balance of style and protection, and the quality construction ensures it will last for a long time. If you're in the market for a new phone case, this one is definitely worth considering.",
