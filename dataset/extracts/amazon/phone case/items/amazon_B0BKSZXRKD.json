It is pretty true to only to cards. I thought I could squeeze in a third, and though you technically can, it bows out the slide and I feared it would permanently irregulars it. But and idea and one credit card is all I really need most days and it works. It\u2019s also just as sturdy as the otter box case I had used before.",

It charges well on my wireless charger even though the card is in the phone holder of the case. I was worried I would have to remove my card to charge it but I don't. The one small thing that I'm not crazy about is the setting to move my phone to \"ring or vibrate\". That setting is a little deep into the case and it takes my mind a second or two to get it set like I need it. It isn't necessarily a bad thing but that is the only thing I have noticed that might need mentioning. The other buttons are all easily accessible and it is really not a big deal for the ring setting. Overall totally recommend this phone case.",

Material was a little cheap and the door to the cards did slip every now and then. It did hold its own for a few years until I got a new phone. If you tend to misplace your wallet but never your phone, this is a good alternative.",

The back of the case stores TWO credit card sized items - in my case, my driver's license and one credit card. I rarely carry cash anymore because it's so easy to use Zelle or the CashApp instead.It's a little difficult to get the cards out of the back, but with a little practice, not too bad. Don't try it with gloves though. It requires using your fingernail to pry them out. But on the upside, they won't fall out, even if the lid is open!I am very happy with this and wished I had one years ago!",

My XR has a cracked back and this makes it look better than new.Moderately thick but I don't mind, I have big hands. Nice to be able to hold money or cards in the drawer, it will hold 2 credit cards and has a rubber base to keep them from sliding. Only minor compalint is that the door could open a bit more, but it really isn't a problem.",
