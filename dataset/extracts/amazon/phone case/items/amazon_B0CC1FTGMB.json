                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research for a phone case for my new iPhone and this is the one I went with. It was the right color combination that I wanted and it looks great on my phone. I also read the reviews and watched the videos on if it was compatible with the popsocket grips and it looked very promising. It arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. I snapped it onto my phone and it was easy installation. I also like the fact that if I need to take off the case, it comes off easily than other ones that I have had over the years. It adds great protection for what I need and I've dropped it a few times and so far no scratches or dents on the case. I like that it has raised bumpers on the corners and it also has a phone accessory holes on the lower left hand side. I can't remember the last time I've had that on a phone case! I am also happy that the magnetic grip is very strong as they state to the point that I have to pry off my popsocket to remove it. Guaranteed to hold and not just fall off. Overall, I love it. It's durable and does the job. Highly recommend.",

I would add that the case is not sealed so dust will get under the case every now and then. Being a protective case, it does add a very noticeable weight to my otherwise light phone. There appears to be a slot on the side for a lanyard as well. Camera lens and screen protection is adequate to lay on any flat surface. Since I don\u2019t always have the case on, it does help does it\u2019s not too rigid that it\u2019s easy to put on and off my phone. Great case overall, just not as minimalist as I\u2019d like but then again, I chose a case to have MagSafe compatibility so it somewhat limited my options.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this case for my iPhone 15 Pro and I am very happy with it. The case is compatible with MagSafe, which means I can easily attach and detach accessories like chargers, wallets, and stands. The magnets are strong and secure, and they do not interfere with the wireless charging or the signal.The case also offers military-grade protection, which means it can withstand drops and shocks without damaging the phone. The edges are slightly raised to protect the screen and the camera. The case is yellowing resistant and scratch-resistant, which means it will stay clear and clean for a long time. I hope it does not yellow over time, as some other clear cases do.The best part of this case is that it showcases the natural colour of the iPhone. I love the design and the colour of my iPhone 15 Pro, and I do not want to hide it behind a bulky or colourful case. This case is clear and transparent, and it lets the beauty of the iPhone shine through. It also fits perfectly and feels comfortable in the hand.Overall, I highly recommend this case to anyone who is looking for a clear, magnetic, and protective case for their iPhone 15 Pro. It is worth every penny and it makes the iPhone even more enjoyable to use.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing to note is that this case fits like a glove. I mean, a perfect fit. As far as cases go, this one is sturdy. The sides have a soft feel to them but, it's got a thick and hard bumper that protects your phone. The clear plastic hasn't changed color (it hasn't been too long) but usually you can tell when something is going to get dirty or stain pretty early on. The Mag Safe magnet works perfectly. I have a Mag Safe Pop Socket on it and it snaps on easily. I've taken the Pop Socket off and on and the magnet on the case is going strong. I love how it has buttons molded over the existing phone ones and they never fail to do what they gotta do when you click them. This case doesn't have a cover over the camera lenses but, I chose that specifically. I take a lot of pictures and I don't want anything in between the lens. The nice thing about the case, though, is that the cameras are bordered by a sturdy and thick-ish frame that kind of raises it so your lenses won't be scratched when you put your phone down. Overall, it's a great case, I think it's priced fairly for the quality. ESR really made a beautiful case.",
