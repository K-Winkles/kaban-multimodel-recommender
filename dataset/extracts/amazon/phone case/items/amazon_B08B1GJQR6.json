                "reviewText": "Dropped my phone and the case saved the phone. Case got blasted and the back is shattered but no damage to the phone. Only critique is the portion of the case that is on the perimeter of the case doesn't rise high enough above the front and back of the phone. This is mainly important when dropping the phone on a slightly bumpy surface like in a parking lot and the phone lands flat on the screen. The outside of the case doesn't allow for enough clearance to prevent a bumpier surface of hitting the screen. Although the phone has a solid front and rear panel. Need to replace my case now after my drop but will definitely be buying this same case. Definitely worth it for the price. This is a slim case, the higher sides would definitely add some size although I'm more used to larger phones, this case does really well if you want a slim case that you won't notice as much while in your pocket.",

                "reviewText": "The case was packaged nicely, with removable protective plastic on all the clear parts. The case fits over the iPhone SE 2020 nicely and snaps together pretty easily. Removing it is not as easy (which is a good thing) but is doable with a little care and effort. Though it doesn\u2019t feel extremely sturdy, it is enough to protect the phone. The front cover makes the screen a little more reflective, but is worth the protective trade off in my opinion.Now onto the not so good. First the front and back didn\u2019t snap together perfectly, there is an ever so slight gap on one of the edges. The red color is a little brighter than expected, a shade brighter than the Product Red iPhone SE 2020. And finally, the buttons don\u2019t have much tactile feedback anymore with this case, that\u2019s probably the worst thing about it, granted, the buttons still work fine through the case.Overall it would be a 3.5 star case, but I rounded it up to 4",

                "reviewText": "I didn't even hear my phone fall - less than 3 feet to the pebbles below. This case had saved it through many a drop and the phone came up fine so I wasn't worried when I found it on the ground. This time the glass shattered after catching a little stone just barely on the edge of the glass. Sickening.I had forgotten that the case covered the glass, too. Hoping against hope I found the iPhone PERFECT when the shattered case front came off.That was a stunning outcome. So glad to find a red Miracase replacement still available. I'll use Miracase for any future iPhone I have if they have a case that fits.Ugly to perfect in less than five minutes. Woohoo!",

It did the job of saving the expensive part...the phone so I am grateful. The plastic screen also cracked. It made it look like my phone screen was cracked. It was not easy to remove when I needed to access my phone directly. I wouldn't purchase this type of phone cover again for that reason. I will stress, however, it saved my phone several times.",
