                "reviewText": "Every phone I purchase, I always get a Otterbox, this is no exception.Since buying this, I think I have dropped my phone anywhere from a couple of feet off the ground to up to 18 to 20 feet onto cement and my phone has never had an issue, not a single crack anywhere, so it is definitely a very durable case.The few times that I have taken my phone out it has been only to give it a quick little wipe out and then put it back on, it is very easy to clean and of course looks great, although after such a long time still looks good.The appearance is great and the quality is just as good, the size fits my iPhone 11 perfectly, and my phone feels very secure in my hand.About the only downfall was that it didn\u2019t have the built-in screen protector like all the others did, but purchasing an aftermarket one works just as well and has done a great job and has fit perfectly anyway.Besides that I would highly recommend this case for anybody that tend to have slippery fingers when it comes to keeping your phone in one piece, definitely good value",

I don't think there's ever been a time where I have had this case on and I dropped my phone and it cracked or chipped. These cases are very durable and will keep your phone scratch free. These are great cases for people constantly on the go or even for people working in harsh conditions for their job or workplace. Great for everyday use and is not as bulky as people make them seem so they fit in your pocket great. They last a long time as there hasn't been a case I've bought from letterbox that didn't last me the duration of my phone before I bought another one because I upgraded my iPhone. Overall, this is a product I will continue to highly recommend to anyone that wants to buy a case for their phone especially if you like keeping your phone looking good and not having to replace it because it couldn't keep it off the ground. This product definitely deserves its (5) Stars!",

The clip is solid, and the lean-to style position makes watching videos at an angle simple and easy. Not having a screen protector is fine\u2014not everyone wants one. That way you can purchase your own after doing your own research.",

I ride a motorcycle and it often bumps around in the top box of the bike.I need my phone for my job and I need to to work.Enter these style of cases, this is the second case for my phone, the last one just simply wore out.It's a bummer that this case no longer has a screen protector built in, and sells for the same price as those that did. that means that I have to budget for a screen cover, and the glass cover break pretty often so there is that to think about.Other than that, there are no real complaints except I would really like to have a high viz color for the hard plastic portions of the case, Orange, yellow, or yellow green or even glow in the dark!That way I can find the phone in the bottom of a bag or in some other dark area, or when I get up from a booth and I look back to see if I left anything.I really like the way it covers the stupid fruit logo on the back of my phone. I don't need to show anyone I use that brand, unless that brand is willing to pay me to show their label.I also like the way that even with the silicon or rubber or whatever they use for the soft touch parts of the case, you can stick a sticker to it. this really helps when there are two people in the office who use the same phone and the same case!",
