So far a good sturdy case, side buttons easy to use and it's comfy to hold, doesn't slip out of your hands. I drop my phone all the time and needed a drop proof case this is it! Great price too and love the color . Just make sure you put it on right, it comes apart in 3 or 4 pieces don't try to it on as one piece like me \ud83d\ude11",

Thank goodness that a previous buyer had left a review saying that it has to be taken apart to get it on. It DOES come apart in 3 pieces. The pastel color has to be popped out of the dark color. The pastel color is hard and fits on the phone. The dark color is more flexible and stretches over the phone and hard case. It fits my phone perfectly! All the ports and buttons match up exactly right. Love the colors and the feel of the case!",

This does not include a screen protector but the case protrudes maybe an 1/8th inch from the glass so I think it offers good protection for the screen. The case also has a flap that you need to hold back in order to put the charger in place. Takes a little getting used to but keeps the charging port clean.",

                "reviewText": "No instructions on how to put it on correctly, so it was quite a struggle. However once it was on, it felt like a sturdy, durable case.The reason I don't like it... The phone itself is quite large, and this case adds quite a bit more bulk and weight. Not an issue for some, but I have smallish hands and the hand holding the phone literally started to ache after just a short time. So I'm going to look for a case that is specifically lightweight. Otherwise I would use this case.Also wanted to say, I ordered the wine red/pink one, and is exactly like the picture. Which I wouldn't call wine red???? I was hoping the pic would be wrong and it would be more reddish, but nope.... It's just like the picture. Nice color, just know that it's more of a plum color rather than wine red, imo.",
