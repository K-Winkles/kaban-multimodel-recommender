                "reviewText": "Getting a new cell phone can be stressful. Upgraded from iPhone 7 to 13 this week. But, of course, the cell phone store was out of simple cases for the 13. Very pleased to find this inexpensive case on Amazon, so I bought it. The cell store price probably would have been much more.The plastic case is well made and will provide the bumper protection I want when it bangs on something. The phone buttons are easy to press through the case and there is a slight ridge on the back edge, circling the whole phone. Makes it easy to hold. Also, the camera lenses are not covered, but the case has a slight ridge around them to keep them from bumping a surface like a table. Holes around the edge for speakers, charger, and mute button are excellent.There is no cover for the glass front of the phone and I didn't want one. If you want simplicity, no artwork, no credit card holder, and no color, then this is just right.",

I bought this cover as a replacement for a different silicone cover that had a sticky feel to it that kept grabbing my hair every time I used it, and I'm definitely happy with this one.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very minimalist, elegant phone case. The back is clear and the side bumpers are a translucent soft pink. On my black phone it offers a soft, subtle, distinctive color. The back is very thin and the side bumpers are more substantial- as a result, I feel a ridge all around the back edge where the bumper meets the back. This is unusual, in my experience, but not unpleasant. The plastic is smooth, soft, and not sticky - it doesn\u2019t pick up lint in my pocket. I have no idea yet how well it will protect my phone in a fall, but I am slightly concerned about that because the side bumpers feel rigid rather than having some give. I don\u2019t drop my phone often so this case offers elegance at a very low price and I am very pleased with it. It\u2019s possible that if you want drop protection you should look for a case that is more technical and engineered for that.",
