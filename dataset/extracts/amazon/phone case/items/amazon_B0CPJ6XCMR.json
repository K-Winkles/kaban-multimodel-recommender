I purchased this hybrid protective case for my new SE3 (2022] as a temp solution that was guided more by its inexpensive price and convenient overnight delivery. I have a tendency to drop my phone a lot, and I need a good protective case. I wasn\u2019t keen on a US$70 military grade case that adds a lot of weight, and I didn\u2019t have time to pour through the 4,000 items in my search results. But I\u2019ve had hybrid cases in the past with positive results, but all hybrids aren\u2019t equal as many are built more for style rather than protection.This cover/case combo is a hybrid design, having a first layer comprised of a firm-flex silicone cover with reenforced corners and formed ridges and cutouts to integrate with an outer, rigid plastic shell. This outer shell has an attractive metallic matte finish that partially encases the silicone layer, locking both layer on the iPhone with a tight grip of the side bezels. The shell leaves the top and bottom of the silicone layer open, which allows the silicone and corner bumpers to absorb and deflect impacts. Once assembled, the raised edge of the silicone cover surrounds the entire screen bezel, providing a protective buffer for the screen in flat falls. This product also includes an optional, clear, rigid screen protector (and a 2nd spare) to guard against scratches and spills, which I preferable to cases with attached plastic screen cover.So\u2026 after 9wks and NUMEROUS drops, I am surprisingly satisfied with this hybrid case. I\u2019ve had some epic drops that include a 5ft fall from my SUV\u2019s roof onto my concrete driveway, where my SE3 impacted directly on a corner and literally bounced 1ft onto its back. One drop started with an initial 3ft drop while walking down a steep concrete stairway, then my phone tumbled end-over-end, gaining momentum as it bounced another 15ft . In another fumble, I dropped my about 4ft in a flat-fall onto a marble floor, landing screen down with a loud SMACK! All 3 incidents were cringe-worthy drops where I totally expected damage, but both my iPhone screen and body were undamaged. And if you prefer the added coverage of a screen protectors, this case come with two (2), which is $$ savings in itself.I like the metallic look of the hard case, and the textured sides and back offer a comfortable grip. The cut-outs for buttons, speakers and port are properly aligned for easy access. At first I gave no value to the case\u2019s kickstand as I don\u2019t watch videos on it, but I soon learned it\u2019s a handy prop when using my phone to listen to a playlist or podcast or as a bedside alarm clock. And in long calls/video chats, the square ring provides a comfortable, secure anchor to slip over a single finger or even hang on the wall with a thumb tack. I think Apple has increase the iPhone\u2019s impact resistance, but I don\u2019t think that my iPhone would have survived, undamaged without this case. All in all, this iPhone SE3 hybrid case/cover provides excellent protection, and it\u2019s a very affordable solution in the US$10 range. I\u2019d definitely purchase this product again.",

                "reviewText": "Great price, does the job, but is made of HEAVY DUTY quality plastic with metallic finish, not actual metal.It did not keep my iPhone screen from breaking when dropped on concrete from a distance of less than four feet, but it did keep the rest of my iPhone safe and secure.I am a very clumsy person with mild dystomia (a hand/eye and muscular coordination disorder from birth) so I drop things a lot and this case performed admirably for the price and outlasted my iPhone7 (once there is a crack it keeps on cracking and I carry my phones in my front pocket, not a purse).Well worth a purchase, wish this company made a case for the cheap Android phone that I have now.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a couple of these for my iPhone SE. They are very durable and attractive. My complaint is that the knob on the rear of the holder makes it difficult to connect to any auto phone holder. That knob pushes the phone too far forward making the holder base ineffective at holding the phone. It also makes flat charging difficult because the phone won't lay flat on the charger and uncomfortable to carry in your pants pocket. I never used the integrated stand, so found it pointless (for my use). I eventually gave this design up for a simpler, flatter design.Big Rudy",
