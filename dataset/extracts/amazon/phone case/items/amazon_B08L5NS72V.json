                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant about buying this case considering the price-point, but I figured I\u2019d give it a try after it went on sale. I am so glad that I did! The fit is absolutely perfect, the texture is perfect for griping but not being too sticky, and it cleans very easily. I got white concrete dust all over my hands, and I had to use my phone, so I got that dust all over the case while I was holding it. It wiped right off with a cloth, none of it stuck to the case, which I thought was very impressive with how sticky that dust can be. I\u2019ve gotten it on tool handles, and other things where it actually stuck to it. So definitely good on the ease of cleaning. Also, if anyone is curious, this case\u2019s silicone material matches the feel of the silicone on the iPad Magic Keyboard Case, and it also perfectly color matches with the black one. And the magsafe capabilities are awesome! I would highly recommend this case. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

I convinced my husband and several friends to buy the same silicone case.Fast forward 9 months and this case is garbage.First, I dropped my phone once in July. My entire back glass is shattered. Fast forward a few weeks and I started to notice cracking around the edges of the phone. 3 out of 4 corners now have cracked and ripped pieces.I haven't been especially hard on this phone or case. And I've never had a case respond so poorly to regular use, or need to be replaced in nine months.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased for $69+ because it was an official Apple case that had MagSafe, the quality is anything but official.Goods:The case is soft to hold, the colour is nice, and it does offer decent protection. MagSafe is currently a useless feature.Cons:Less than a year of ownership, the case\u2019s corners, have started to peel off. Mind you, I accidentally dropped my phone 3 separate times, onto a hardwood floor, from a short height. So in a way, the case did it\u2019s job but still, you expect more from an Apple product.Despite the case still being under warranty, Apple refuses to offer a refund or a FREE replacement (offered a paid replacement of $69+ LOL). Called them twice, and both times they said my case damage doesn\u2019t fall/look like the \u201cpictures\u201d of what falls under their \u201cwarranty\u201d policy. In other words \u201cit\u2019s not a manufacturer defect, so we can\u2019t do anything.\u201dReading the other reviews on here, it seems corner peeling is a common occurrence with these cases. If that\u2019s not considered a manufacturer defect, then I don\u2019t know what is.",
