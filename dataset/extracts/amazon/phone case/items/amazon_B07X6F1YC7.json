I don't like carrying my purse or wallet around with me, and with this case, I'm able to fit three cards in the slot comfortably. Not to mention I've already dropped my phone about ten times on every surface imaginable, and every time, there's not a scratch on the case, or my phone screen. It's durable and makes my life easier, which is all I can ask for.**3 Year Update** As stated above, I'm fairly accident-prone. The case held up to about 3 years of me dropping it nearly every day on every surface imaginable before finally breaking. Towards the end of this little trooper's life, it did have a tendency to break apart (the purple part of the case is not super well attached to the black part) and cards did end up going everywhere, so keep that in mind if you're as accident-prone as I am. Still, with the combination or this and a screen protector my phone is still pretty much fine! I just re-ordered this case, so my phone stands a pretty good chance of survival for the next few years.",

HOWEVER I have zero problem buying one every 6 months or so because they are SO affordable! It\u2019s also fun to change up the color. I have been using these cases for about 3 years and I have never had damage to my phone while using them!",

                "reviewText": "These are made so cheaply and break easily with any drop, but I keep buying them because there isn\u2019t a better concept for a phone wallet case. I\u2019ve gone through several other wallet cases and this one is still my favorite, despite being on my 3rd one within 9 months. The good news is the case breaks but my phone is fine every time so it\u2019s doing it\u2019s job. The case is slim, doesn\u2019t affect the camera, and the slide cover does easily slide back and forth. I\u2019ve gone back and forth on giving this a 3 or 4 star. It\u2019s 5 star in the concept, 1 star in quality. I will probably keep buying them because it does exactly what I need it to do.",
