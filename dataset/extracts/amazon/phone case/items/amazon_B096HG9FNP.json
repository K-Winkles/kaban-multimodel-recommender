I settled on this one because a reviewer said it was easy to take out of the case. Then I tried opening the cardholder as shown by Vena and placing the entire phone in this case on the wireless charger. Both methods worked perfectly. Some notes: My wireless charger is a Belkin. I dropped the case initially and noticed the card slot slipped open. My old iPhone in the Vena case charged wirelessly on the same Belkin station and now doesn't. I wish the sides had more texture to support gripping the slim, sleek design. Will buy it again!",

Yes the credit card holder can be flimsy but just be careful with it. I also like to add a handle to the back of my phone and the last one I had was too long to apply to the cover of the credit card case. I found the perfect one. It\u2019s posted on my picture and it\u2019s a LOVEHANDLE and fits perfectly with strong support of a 3M two-sided sticker. I love this rose combo!",

I used to purchase this brand for the entire family, but the last 3 that I purchased have not made it more than 2 months before this piece breaks on the cover (see photo). It has broken on all three phone cases in the same spot. I would t waste my money on this case. We are trying a different brand that is half the price\u2026 But the way these are being manufactured by Spigen. I\u2019m sure it will hold up just as well and won\u2019t cost me as much to replace.",
