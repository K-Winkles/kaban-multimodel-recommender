                "reviewText": "I bought this about a year ago for my iPhone 14 Pro Max. My phone is EXTREMELY important for my job and I use it constantly. As such, it gets fumbled and dropped. I had Verizon install a screen protector the day I got it and bought this case to protect it. It handled several falls - even on corners - that in the past would have destroyed the phone. Recently two corners cracked after I stupidly knocked the phone off a counter onto its corners, multiple times. At first I thought it was the phone screen and was blown away to see the phone was fine - the case sacrificed itself. I bought a replacement from another brand that was highly rated and it barely worked with the Verizon screen protector - you had to hammer the keyboard to get it to work. I am returning that one today after getting my replacement Temdan case - it is easy to use and it works PERFECTLY with the additional screen protector. I am rarely this enthusiastic about products like this but it's awesome. Recommend!",

I could hear perfectly fine, but the person on the other end of the call couldn't hear me well at all. I had to open the charging port cover to allow them to hear me at all (or use my headset, which I most often do anyway.) So I wasn't going to let it inconvenience me much. Till today that is. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and found the lens protector shattered. I have no idea how it happened. I hadn't noticed anything wrong with the cover early this morning, then all of a sudden I found shattered sharp edges over the camera lens. ;( boo.It is also slightly heavier than the other case I typically used, and found the charging magnet I use in my car was not strong enough to hold the phone up with the added weight.",

                "reviewText": "As a customer who recently purchased the Temdan Waterproof Case for my iPhone 12, I am extremely disappointed with my experience. I give this product a rating of 1 out of 5 stars.Firstly, while the case promises to be waterproof with an IP68 rating, I found that my phone was still damaged after being submerged in water for just a few seconds. This is extremely concerning as I purchased the case specifically for its waterproof feature. The built-in 9H tempered glass screen protector did not prevent water from entering the case, which resulted in damage to my phone.Furthermore, the case claims to provide military-grade protection and be shockproof, but I found that my phone was still susceptible to damage even with the case on. The full body coverage did not protect my phone from a fall of just a few feet, which resulted in significant damage to the phone itself. This is unacceptable given the claims made by the manufacturer.The case also claims to be dustproof, but I found that this was not the case. Dust and other small particles were able to enter the case and damage my phone. This is particularly concerning as I use my phone regularly in outdoor environments, where dust is often present.Finally, while the case claims to provide real 360 protection, I found that this was not the case. The edges of the case were not secure and often slipped off, leaving parts of my phone exposed to damage.Overall, I would not recommend the Temdan Waterproof Case for iPhone 12. The claims made by the manufacturer do not hold up in real-world use, and the case did not provide the protection I needed for my phone. If you are looking for a reliable, protective case for your phone, I would suggest looking elsewhere.When it comes to selecting the best iPhone 12 case, there are several factors to consider, including:1. Protection: The primary function of a case is to protect your iPhone 12 from damage due to drops, bumps, and scratches. Look for cases with a durable construction and shock-absorbing materials, such as TPU or polycarbonate.2. Design: The design of the case should complement the look and feel of your iPhone 12 while providing easy access to buttons, ports, and cameras.3. Grip: The case should have a good grip to prevent accidental drops and make it easier to hold your iPhone 12.4. Slimness: A slim case offers good protection while maintaining the sleek profile of the iPhone 12.5. Compatibility: Make sure the case you choose is compatible with wireless charging if that's important to you.6. Price: iPhone 12 cases can range from a few dollars to over a hundred, so consider your budget when selecting a case.Ultimately, the best iPhone 12 case for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences.",

                "reviewText": "Great price, great durability, quality phone protection, and easy installation. I bought my first one 2 yrs ago, and just ordered it again to replace my old one. Even though the back plate separated from the edges because of 2 years worth of rough wear and tear (as expected with little ones), it held in place when my phone was in it and protected it still. I only replaced it due to the sides becoming dingy and the back plate scratched, which was only really noticeable when I took it off. If I was solely repurchasing it based on the protection of my phone, I believe it could have protected my phone much longer.This case when paired with this screen protector ( https://a.co/d/1bBwu9M ) is in my humble opinion, better than any Otter Box than I have owned previously. And it\u2019s a combo I will continue to use as long as it\u2019s available and its quality stays the same.",
