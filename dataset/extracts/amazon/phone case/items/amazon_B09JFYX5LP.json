                "reviewText": "This is my 2nd of these cases. Sturdy and durable. I previously had the pink one which did absorb dye from my dark jeans and eventually the screen protector film pulled away from the case. However, for the price and as long as it lasted, I am satisfied with the quality. I ordered another one in a darker color (dark purple) so it would not show stains/wear and tear as much. I am very pleased w/ the color. The finger print reader does not work on either. Definitely a disappointment, minor inconvenience, but for the protection it gives my phone, it's a worth the trade off to me. Easy to remove and clean the screen protector when needed. I recommend this product if the finger print reader is a feature that you can live without.",

My navy blue is more like dark gray and navy blue combo, with solid light blue wallpaper creates fantastic looking combo. My wife's rose color looks good on back but on sides it looks pink which she doesn't like - I think it will darken up with time (dust, grease) so we'll keep it. Kickstand works fine. Screen protector works fine - fingerprint we don't use so I can't rate it. Definitely would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "This fit my phone perfectly, and is a good quality case that will keep your phone protected in the event you drop it or accidentally throw it, which I am very prone to doing because I am very clumsy. The case also has a built in screen protector, which is thinner on the bottom where the fingerprint reader is so you can still use it.Now this worked great for a while, but as time went by, what started as a small flaw turned into a deal breaker. This screen protector is not optional; if you take it off, you've taken the front part of the case off, so your phone will fall out of it. And the screen cover is not replaceable; it's permanently affixed to the case. You can't pull it out and slap in a new one. In theory this sounds good, but as time went by, the cover got dirtier.Dust, hair, fingerprints, and lord only knows what else gets stuck on the underside of the protector. And the plastic on the fingerprint scanner got so smudged that not only could I not use the fingerprint scanner, but the screen around it had a hard time registering my touches. And on top of that, with all the gunk under the screen protector, it was basically impossible to see my phone screen in direct sunlight.This meant I had to take the front of the case off and clean the screen protector, but that didn't last long before it got dirty again. If you can live with taking the thing apart and cleaning the screen protector every so often, this isn't a bad choice of phone case. But cutting off the fingerprint scanner (and that part of the screen as a whole) and making the phone unusable direct sunlight killed it for me. I went and got a new case without a screen protector and I do not miss having that sheet of plastic blocking my touches.Like I said, if having to regularly take the case apart to clean the screen protector is not a deterrent for you, this isn't a bad case, but it certainly was for me.",
