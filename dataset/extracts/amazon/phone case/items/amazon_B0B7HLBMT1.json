Control buttons and mute function work the same, no degradation of audio or video. I like the added \"bumps\" on the corner of the case as that's where my old Apple case ripped open with a chunk torn out. I chose the red case so it would not blend in with the color of my Jeep Wrangler interior which is black. Very well made, very attractive, very affordable, about 1/4 the cost of my old Apple phone case. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I like how secure it is. Setting it up was easy, and it comes with two screen protectors. My old screen protector was fine so I haven\u2019t used those yet. Cameras work well and the case perfectly fits all the lenses. Overall, seems sturdy.The one downside is that, despite claiming to be mag safe compatible, the connection is so weak. I can\u2019t use my MagSafe popsocket because it falls off with even the slightest pressure (such as opening the popsocket) and the \u201cbragging whole\u201d (aka circle so you can see the Apple) means I can\u2019t stick an old fashion sticky pop socket on either.Considered returning because I can\u2019t use popsocket but, for now at least, figure durability is more important. Much more durable than the two Apple cases I\u2019ve previously bought.",

                "reviewText": "The overall case is fine, but don\u2019t rely on the screen protectors going on easily. There were no real directions to apply the screen protector but I have done it enough times to know how to apply one. After removing my old protector, I did the wet cleaning, dry cleaning and dust removal. Removed the backing on the protector and dropped it into place\u2026\u2026 it did not adhere in about 10 places\u2026.. fish eyes. I could not clear it (I could see MAYBE missing 1 speck but not that many). So I removed the protector and decided to start all over with the second protector provided. Went through the entire cleaning process again, dropped the second protector into place and the same thing happened!!!! I removed that protector also and went and got the extra protector I had in the draw that I bought previously. When through the cleaning process, dropped the protector on the screen and it adhered perfectly!!! I threw the screen protectors away that came with the cover and just put the bottom (back) part of the case on my phone (the top frame is not necessary). The only reason I replaced the screen protector in the first place was because it splintered & cracked while I tried putting the top cover on as the bottom part overlaps the top piece to hold it on ( it was such a tight fit, I splintered the edges of the screen protector trying to muscle it on). That all being said, the back part of the case will work for me (the front & screen protectors are junk)\u2026. I gave it 3 stars for that reason.",
