The cards are snug.Case is also very slim, has the right amount of coverage (volume and power buttons) as well as enough bezel to protect the camera lens and screen. The textured grip is also nice, but I don\u2019t notice it when in hand at all.",

                "reviewText": "First time with this company. Case fits nicely on to the iphone 13 pro. I got it in black and it looks decent. I keep three cards in the back. They can be a little annoying to get out (like takes an extra couple of seconds to remove them vs taking them out of a wallet but the flip side is that they are in the case securely so won't go flying out if I have to pull out my phone and take a call, so it is a tradeoff I can live with. The case is not too thick but it is thick enough that when you lay it down on a desk face up the camera lens are not making contact with the desk because the case lifts the phone up just enough to prevent direct contact between the camera lenses and the surface.The case feels sturdy but thankfully I haven't dropped my phone yet so haven't had to see if the case held up. My last phone I went for over two years with no case and no screen protector. The glass on the back of the phone cracked and the camera lens got a scratch which impacted photos, hence why this phone has a case and screen protector. The sides have a decent grip to them. The only thing I do not like is the feel of the back which is very slick. I have to be very careful to make sure I am holding the sides where there is grip and not grabbing the back of the phone because I could see it slipping out of my hand easily when taking it out of my too quickly if I just grab on to the back. For the price I think it is worth it.",

I carry my driver license, a bank card, one business card and a twenty dollar bill. I do keep my wallet in my car, with several other id cards that I seldom need, but this case is perfect for general use, meets my needs perfectly. Bought in February of this year, still like new.

Well then smack my butt and call me sally, burn your current phone case; because this is the phone case for you!My wife and I got new iPhone 13 pros today (because treat yo self!) and we decided to go with these Smartish cases simply because neither of us carry wallets or a purse (we\u2019re millennials, get over it) and boy am I glad we did!As soon as we had a little unboxing therapy, we got the screen protectors on and the phones in our new nifty Smartish cases we decided to take a break from the phones for some family time. That family time consisted of our toddler daughter finding said phones and running around the house with them yelling \u201cghdfcajdkyjtvsgsjandv\u201d when we approached her and asked her nicely for them back she looked at us with her big puppy dog eyes, summoned her inner MLB pitcher and proceeded to yeet the phones across the living room. When I picked up the phones, half expecting them to look like a Ford Pinto in a fender bender, they were completely fine! Not only were the phones safe from the impact, because of the raised edges on the case, the tempered glass was not even chipped.So all in all, these cases are not only great looking and stylish; they are also toddler proof, making them truly Smartish!",
