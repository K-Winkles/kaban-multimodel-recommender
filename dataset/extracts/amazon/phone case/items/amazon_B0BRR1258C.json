                "reviewText": "I never owned a wallet style phone case before. But the Amazon listing stated it was made specifically for my new A11 phone, so I thought I would give it a try. When I received the phone case back in January of 2021, I was very impressed with it's Quality of Construction, it's use of Premium Materials (REAL Leather) & the Case came with a screen protector made of REAL Tempered Glass! All of this for just under $15 USD & that $15 included State's Sales Tax & Shipping! This purchase has proven to be an Excellent Value for the Money, since most phone cases these days are made of faux leathers & screen protectors are made from transparent plastics. The Tempered Glass screen protector fit Perfectly & my Samsung A11 phone fit like Glove in this Case. And it came with a Handy Carrying Strap! What more can I say about this phone case; I have use my phone with it's protective case Daily (many hours a day) since January 2021 & it's sturdiness & durability has been proven & I expect this phone case will last many years.",
