I\u2019ve been using it daily for 2 weeks and by this time I can always tell if a case is going to be poor quality, feel weird in the hand or get too linty from my pocket. This case still looks brand new, doesn\u2019t attract lint and goes in and out of my pocket easily. The frosted back essentially feels exactly the same as the phone itself. They advertise that the frosted back is anti finger print and I\u2019d have to agree. It\u2019s summer time and I\u2019m constantly grabbing my phone with sweaty, dirty or wet hands. Case still looks great. This is a rare 5/5 stars and for less than $10 this case may be the best deal on Amazon.",
