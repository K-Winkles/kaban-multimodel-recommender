Port and speaker cut outs on point. Works with screen protector. Grip is similar to Apple silicone case, not too slippery. Initially impressed with how good the quality feels on this case for the price! Hopefully it holds up well over time. Includes optional button colors to personalize your case. I chose yellow. :)",

                "reviewText": "I really love this green case so much. It's just as described, military-grade protection. And very good protection for my phone. The green color fits my temperament very well. So cool! Also, the translucent design of the back panel of this case can show off the shape of the phone even more and it looks very high-end.In fact, at that time I also searched for a lot of homes to compare. My favorite TORRAS is this phone case because a long time ago I heard of this brand. And I want to try it. I did not expect that the texture is really quite good. A little beyond my expectation. Very awesome!In the end, the after-sales service of TORRAS is also great. They provide a quality warranty, if you have any issues with your phone case during the use. Please contact them directly and they will give you a reasonable solution, which is great!I hope TORRAS will continue to work hard and make even better products!",

                "reviewText": "I have a very hard time finding cases that I find aesthetically pleasing and offer decent protection.This case has a very smooth, almost velvety silicone-type feel to it, yet the 3M sticker for my ring stand stays strongly put and it feels like you can keep a solid grip on it. Exactly what I needed.I saw two listings with the same case size specifications from Torras, but with a slightly different price and Alpine green was pictured in a different shade in each listing. Same name different shade. This particular listing appeared more army green and it is the one I went with. It is exactly the shade pictured. I can\u2019t speak for the other listing though. It is thin, but feels like it offers decent protection. I added a glass screen and camera protector.Would definitely recommend this case.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this iPhone case is better than I expected. This iPhone 13 Pro case is fantastic and really suits my needs. The key features for me; It offers good protection around the corners and edges, the backside is raised providing needed protection around the camera, and it still maintains a slim profile. Most often my phone is in my hand, or my pocket. It has a comfortable grip, making it easier to hold the phone securely unlike some other cases that tend to have a slick feel, and the case is not bulky so it\u2019s easy to hold on to and fits easily in my pocket. I\u2019m sometimes careless with my phone, but with this case I can confidently pick it up without worrying about dropping it. If you\u2019re looking for a good case at a reasonable price, I would recommend giving Torras phone cases a try.",
