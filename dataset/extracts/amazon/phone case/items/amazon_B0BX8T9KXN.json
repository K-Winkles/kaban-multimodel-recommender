The only thing that could be better are the buttons, which don\u2019t transfer the clicky feeling particularly well. But that really doesn\u2019t matter for me 99% of the time.",

I use a screen protector and it didn\u2019t even crack. Had to replace my camera protection but not the cases fault. Overall very happy with this purchase. Color matches my iPhone perfectly.",
