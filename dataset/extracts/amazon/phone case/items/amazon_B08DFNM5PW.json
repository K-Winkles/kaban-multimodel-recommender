Yesterday a full glass fell right on the screen of my iPhone 13 mini, and it looked like the screen was destroyed. Nope, just the glass on my Miracase, which did a fabulous job protecting the phone. Not a scratch on the phone! I\u2019d had the case for over two years when it gave its little life to save my phone, and I\u2019m happily buying another one. A great case, and cheap insurance that has done a great job protecting my phone.",

Very much worth the price. My only suggestion to the company/issue with this case is that there is no flap to cover the charging port. maybe design the next gen of the case to have that. But overall it is deff a 5ft at product.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Overall A Great Case For The iPhone 13 Mini.",
                "reviewText": "I purchased two of the black cases for the iPhone 13 mini\u2019s we purchased back in January of 2023. We had the first generation iPhone SE models and they were a good size for pocket use and using it for what it\u2019s designed for, a cellphone. We would occasionally use the browser for directions or to look up phone numbers for places while we were out and about.I did some research on the new version of the SE and the reviews were not exactly favorable for reception and overall performance and build, so we decided on the iPhone 13 mini instead of the 3rd generation iPhone SE. I don\u2019t need a large and very cumbersome iPhone and I knew it would end up being broken from bending over and breaking the glass, and I think Apple Care is a waste of money in my opinion. I had it with another iPhone and I still had a deductible on replacing the front glass on top of the monthly charge for the service. If we need to use the Internet, we have iPad Pro 2022 11\u201d models for that at home.These cases are really good protection for your phone because they are protected on the front and back , plus they have a very good rubber bumper that completely surrounds the phone. I\u2019m hard on my phone and I have dropped all of them and just knew that the screen or the back glass was going to be damaged, and I was usually right.The pros of this case are:-Complete coverage of the phone.-A heavy duty rubber bumper around the outer edge.-It\u2019s clear for those of us who like to let people see we buy the \u201cproduct red\u201d devices.-Overall, it\u2019s easy to install and assemble and disassemble.-The price is unbelievable for the case and the protection it offers. The colors available are also amazing. However, we went with the black version.The cons for me are as follows:-The case is similar to the older Otterbox case and it has a very large hole for the charger cable on the bottom. This essentially lets in debris from your pocket and you have to clean the screen and disassemble the case. A small flap would have made a huge difference in preventing this from happening.-The case clearly states it\u2019s compatible with the MagSafe charger, which it is when you lay it down on the charger. However it doesn\u2019t support an external battery pack and it just falls off the black. I purchased a set of external metal rings to prevent the battery pack from falling off the back.-The camera lens are exposed, however I don\u2019t take enough photos to need much more protection than the case gives me. I did however purchase the small lens covers to prevent the camera lens from being scratched in my pocket . I included a photo of my phone with the external lenses protectors and the metal ring that made it possible to use a battery pack with the phone.My biggest issue with this case is that there are no protective panels on the charging port and the switch for the volume control. This would have prevented the need to remove the phone periodically to get the lint and other small bits of stuff out of the case. I would recommend this case to anyone who has the same issue with clumsiness like myself and tend to drop their phones more often than they would admit.Overall, this a great and very protective case for our iPhone 13 mini devices. It\u2019s very cheap in price but it isn\u2019t made cheap. I remember paying more for a specialty case for my 1st generation iPhone SE. Neither my husband nor myself has ever had a desire to purchase the iPhone Pro Max devices as they are just too large and expensive. If I wanted an iPad mini, I would have one, as it\u2019s not that much smaller than the iPad mini. My biggest gripe with these two new devices is the battery life is not that great. We purchased them directly from Apple and mine seems especially bad for holding a longer battery charge. The reviews of the 3rd generation iPhone SE were mostly not great and I think the newer models are better than our old SE models as they are just enough bigger than our iPhone SE models and texting is easier than before. They still fit in my pocket and I don\u2019t feel like I am going to break the screen when I bend over to pick up something. I have already noticed that my phone doesn\u2019t seem to stay charged up for a long period of time. I\u2019m also having trouble getting use to the power button on the side instead of the top and I have hung up on many callers just by picking up the phone.I don\u2019t think you are going to get a better looking phone case , especially for the iPhone 13 mini because Apple is about to release the iPhone 15. We were lucky to get these two phones from Apple as they were not available a week after we bought them. Apple honestly needs to slow down on the production of a new iPhone every few months now. With the economic situation and the price of Apple devices climbing higher and higher, something has to change or people will start looking for alternatives to Apple devices. We have been getting about 5 years of use out of the Apple devises we have purchased in the past. However I don\u2019t know if we can expect to get as many updates on the new iPhone 13 mini\u2019s, the two new 2022 iPad Pro 11\u201d models and a newest model MacBook Pro. We splurged on the MacBook Pro, which is the newest model and was very expensive after we configured it to our needs. We still use our 2017 10.5\u201d iPad Pro devices and we\u2019re hoping that they will get iOS 17, but we aren\u2019t sure it\u2019s going to happen.If this was more like the otterbox and had flaps to keep out the dust bunnies and other stuff that gets in between the glass and the back and screen, it would be a 5 star case for sure. I can see that I\u2019m probably going to be looking for something that will keep the dust out over the next few months.",

Last but not least those portable chargers that cling to the bottom of your phone and attach. It fits right on with case , no need to take case off to charge. Okay that is all. 5 stars.",

I just press normally and it responds with touch all the way to the corners.For security, I like the front cover locking into the outside shell. It provides 360 degree protection and it sends to provide very good protection. However, I haven\u2019t dropped my phone since installing. The case isn\u2019t too obtrusive either. Fits easily into my pocket. And I\u2019m not as worried about putting into my back pocket since the case is so rigid.",
