                "reviewText": "I haven\u2019t dropped my phone again yet, but, rating this case solely on the color, aesthetics, ease of installation and feel- it\u2019s great. The orange tone is bright, yet still soft on the eyes and mood, unlike some other orange shades (hunter\u2019s orange, prison orange or other variations of jarring neon). This case has already proven to be purposeful by making finding my phone a breeze without needing to alert it every time I randomly set it down and forget about it for the umpteenth time every day. Its also smooth and buttery to the touch, with just the right amount of grip and thickness (I\u2019m a female, if hand size matters to you in trying to find the perfect phone to case ratio for comfort). This particular grade of material also doesn\u2019t seem so matte or smooth that it will be likely to eventually show every little scuff that happens from regular, daily wear and tear (price never seems to matter in that regard in my experience, so why pay more?).Anyway, just those attributes alone can make it a value, especially for anyone in my particular situation, with an already broken phone prior to ever using it. Only time will tell if it actually protects my phone from any further damage, but I immediately like everything else, so although I\u2019d really like to believe that I\u2019ll be back here to add an update soon- the odds are that I most likely won\u2019t. It would suddenly need to develop some major, unforeseen flaw capable of provoking me into enough irritation to come back and do it.",

I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go for the designer brand, since I like to play with colors a lot. But it turned out I have kept this case on my phone for exactly a year because I love it so much. It just started getting a little tears in it and chipping at the silicone, so I am re-ordering, probably in white. Totally worth it, super cheap and high-quality.",

Sch\u00fctzen tut es das Handy ebenfalls sehr gut, aber was ich sagen muss ist das es auch Nachteile gibt bei einer Silikon H\u00fclle. Und zwar ist es eine Qual das Handy aus der Hosentasche zu bekommen ohne dass das innere der Hosentasche mit raus kommt, dazu sammelt man nat\u00fcrlich auch Fussel. Daf\u00fcr kann ich aber keinen Stern abziehen, denn es ist nun mal eine Silikon H\u00fclle und die haben es einfach in sich so zu sein. Wer eine Silikon H\u00fclle sucht und ihm das egal absolute Kaufempfehlung. Die H\u00fclle wird auch nicht zur\u00fcckgeschickt, denn die sieht einfach Mega gut aus:)",
