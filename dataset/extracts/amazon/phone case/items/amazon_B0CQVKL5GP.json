Reason being is I smoke cigars, and wanted something I could put my favorite cigar labels in and now when people see my case, they ask where I got a case like this. It is very durable and would like to say that it does the job well. Only thing I needed to do was remove the plastic screen cover, and remove the waterproof casing to get good sound out of the speakers. Otherwise it was really muffled. You do not need water protection with this phone as it can go under water up to 250ft for 30 minutes without a case, so really the need to protect from water really isn't needed. The screen protector either. just get a glass screen protector to go over it, and you got yourself a really good case.",

                "reviewText": "I was apprehensive about what this case might be like but needed a quick fix for a new phone. Turns out, the case is decent, enough. It\u2019s easy to hold onto the phone, and isn\u2019t slippery like many. Feel like it\u2019s got enough protection if it falls to protect it. Nice!The accessories with cases are usually junk. In this case though, they are decent too. Screen protector is glass and went on easily, and the camera protector the same thing. I\u2019m glad they include two of each because I broke the one screen protector being careless getting it out of the case it comes nested in. That\u2019s my bad. And I used one of the camera protectors by removing it when it looked like something was under it, but it turns out the lower camera has some weird optical illusion when you look at it.So just buy this kit and save yourself some cash. It\u2019s complete and all you need. Feels protected!",

                "reviewText": "So far I really like this case. It works well. Protects my phone and keeps it dry. Sometimes I notice a glare and reflection in my photos bc of the lens protectors \u2014 especially in low light. This is a little upsetting to me considering I use my phone for spontaneous photos in my line of work. The case is a bit bulky for your pocket, but it\u2019s actually relatively slim considering how protective it is. Make sure to expose your mic when recording/talking on the phone bc it definitely muffles it and makes audio sound \u201ccrunchy.\u201d",
