The screen protector was incredibly easy to install on a brand new phone and fit like a glove. I honestly can't tell there is a screen protector on the phone. It has zero bubbles when I installed it. I would highly recommend this product.",

I've had other screen protectors that last a lot longer without cracking. There's a good chance when I replace this case that i might get the same case and expect to purchase screen protectors separately.",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered my new Samsung Galaxy S23 phone from Amazon, I knew I wanted a new phone case to protect it. Amazon carries LOTS of phone cases which all look more or less the same, except for color. However, I spotted this Spidercase as an Amazon Pick or Recommended item. Its price was considerably less than the brand names I recognized, plus it offered a nice variety of color choices and included two glass screen protectors as well as two sets of camera lens protectors. So I though, what the heck, I'll give this one a try and I'm very glad I did. It is every bit as good as the name brand case I bought to protect my last phone which did not include any screen/camera protection and was less than half the price! Very happy with this purchase and always happy to save money. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "As a non-traditional student, who specializes in both mechatronic engineering and engineering graphic designs, I was impressed by SPIDERCASE's military-grade phone case for my Samsung Galaxy S22 mobile phone. I must admit that I was initially skeptical of my choice based on some of the verified Amazon customer reviews concerning the protective case not properly sealing due to the use of the lens protector, the appearance of the phone case purchased vs. the image of the phone case in their Amazon store, and the overall quality of the protected case. So I am glad that I dismissed the negative reviews and decided to see for myself. Because I have large hands, the addition of the protective case was exactly what I needed. It provided the additional dimensions needed to ensure a proper fit. The left and right sides of the phone's case are slightly textured, ensuring a sufficient coefficient of friction to prevent unintentional slippage. If, however, you are gripping only the front and back of the phone case, I can guarantee you will drop your phone. The good news is that the phone case is ruggedized with military-grade protection; so if dropped, the damage to your phone will be minimal. Please read SPIDERCASE's instructions, which advise increasing the touch sensitivity of your Galaxy S22 mobile phone before adding the screen protector to it. Additionally, I recommend deleting your registered fingerprints prior to adding the screen protector, and then re-adding them after the new screen protector is in place. Because of the slight thickness of the raised glass, you will need to press a little harder on your mobile phone screen to re-register your new fingerprints. Note: This will hold true each time you use the fingerprint scanner to access your phone due to the thickness of the screen protector added. I gave the SPIDERCASE ruggedized military-grade phone case a 4.8 out of 5 because it delivered exactly what was advertised; which is a phone case designed to be better resistant to wear, stress, and abuse. That's it! No more, no less!Also, for those who are complaining about the color of the phone case as advertised, please know that there is something called \"engineering design graphics\" or \"marketing graphic designs,\" both of which produce 3-D simulations of an object or a device in question. So there will definitely be a slight difference between the simulated vivid color/appearance and the actual color/appearance of the phone case in question.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S22. I'm the kind of guy that carries his phone in his pocket. It's not unusual for me to accidently put my key, change, or the occasional screw in the same pocket, any of which could scratch the screen. A decent screen protector can also save the screen for shattering due to impact (in some cases).The case is okay, but the rubber portion that provides shock protection for the phone seems pretty hard. I haven't dropped the phone on anything hard, but I'd be concerned the impact energy would largely be transferred through the case to the phone. I'm not going to purposely test it to find out. The case does not add much bulk to the phone and the hard plastic exterior holds up well against scratches and slides pretty easily over cloth (easy in and out of pockets). The inner rubber portion is exposed at locations on the side to improve hand grip. The buttons work well.The protector would be fine if not for the S22's ultrasonic finger print sensor. Although the product information claims the protector is compatible with the sensor, in reality, it reduces the functionality of the sensor by 80% or so (my experience, your results may vary). Even after turning up the sensor sensitivity and re-registering my finger prints, the recognition success rate dropped precipitously. There were instances of the \"too many tries\" error message came up. I immediately bought a film type protector and the fingerprint sensor now works almost as good as having no protector at all.The camera lens protector is fine. It applies easily and looks like it will do its job perfectly. Note that it does not fit within the cutout in the case perfectly, but that doesn't seem to cause a problem and is only noticeable if you look closely at it.Overall, I like the case and camera lens protector, but swapped out the main screen protector as soon as I could. For the price, it's an okay deal.",
