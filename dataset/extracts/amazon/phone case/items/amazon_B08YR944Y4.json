Although it isn't bulky, it features the right cuts to ensure that, even with the case on, your phone's buttons and camera function as designed.According to the manufacturer, the waterproof cover can protect the phone from water up to six feet deep. This gives me comfort knowing that my phone would be protected in the event of a crisis, even though I'm not going to try it. I've lost a phone before after being thrown into a pool while carrying it in my pocket.It is not difficult to put on or take off the case, even if it fits the phone snugly. I know it's safe even if I drop it because it has shock absorption. It includes a built-in screen protector, so I don't need to buy one separately, and it can be charged on my wireless charger with the case on. This is reasonably priced, well-made, functional, and protects my phone.",

I have full confidence it will protect my phone from impacts olif dropped. I have no intention of taking the risk to test its waterproof capabilities.Cons: it's much bulkier than I expected but I still keep it. However, I cannot use my charging cable with it (Type C) as the protective housing is too thick to fit. Fortunately, the cable that came with my phone will work but it's much shorter, but I need one for the car as well. I have to buy new cables.",

I wasn't sure how good the quality would be given the price but I was pleasantly surprised when I started using it. It's been about 2 weeks utilizing this new case and my only negative feedback would be the S-Pen is a little hard to get to while in the case but given I rarely use the S-Pen, this isn't a big deal.The case protects my phone from drops which gives me peace of mind if I accidently drop / or it falls. The orange tab near the charger is also a pretty clever design. You can switch it over to give a water tight connection as needed. Very cool. The charging port is also covered so debris / grime doesn't get inside. For the price, I absolutely love this case. Definitely recommend purchasing.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this case for the new Galaxy S24+ and it is a perfect fit. I waited in the past for BodyGlove to roll out their own protective cases but this one is of higher quality than theirs. Super easy installation and fingerprint sensor is still very responsive! The seal around the phone is great and when the charging port is covered and the waterproofing is covering the microphone, no water is able to seap through. Highly recommend this case for S24+",
