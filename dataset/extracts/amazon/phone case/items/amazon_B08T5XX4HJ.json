I don't lose my license or worry about breaking my card in my pocket anymore and it's protected my phone thru 3 drops so far. It's a little slick when you set it down so it will slide off counters if you're not careful (which I found out I'm not) but it takes a fall really well. It holds 2 cards with no trouble and you can squeeze a 3rd in there but it doesn't close quite right. It does block the tap feature so I just carry 2 to keep it easy to open. This might be my favorite purchase this year.",

The little wallet door has even popped out w/ cards falling out. It gets put back together easy peasy (wallet still functions). No glue/etc. Have tucked vax card/hidden emergency cash between the layers and still solid. Re-buying after last tumble was too much of a doozy and after this long I'm happy to reinvest. I keep 3 cards in it always, 2-3 works but 4 would absolutely not.Friend & Apple store employee told me the most protective are hard outside with rubber for shock absorption inside, and can attest it works.Edit to add: works perfectly with pop sockets.",
