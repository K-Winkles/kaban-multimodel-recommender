I have the white iPhone 11 (yes, it\u2019s 2023 and I still have an 11!) this glittery clear case is so pretty on it and easy to hold! But most importantly, it\u2019s a STRONG case and can handle my clumsy self dropping it about 5x a day and bumping into walls! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI bought my first one (exact same case) when I bought my phone from apple, 2.5 yrs ago. Apple no longer carries this case so I hopped on Amazon and was tickled pink they had it and for literally half the price I originally paid for it!My first case held strong for 2 yrs. It just had slight scratches on the bottom and yellowed on the sides but recently the button section on the right side broke so I ordered this replacement one. It\u2019s the exact one I had before.So pretty AND extremely strong, which is what we all appreciate about Otterbox!",

It definitely isn't scratch resistant, the back will end up having minor scratches as all cases do. Not too noticeable. The 'gummy' part of the case does turn brown/yellowish after a while, again all cases do this. The frame around the screen did it's job and held up throughout it all. It started to break at the bottom of the hard piece which made the gummy part of the case slip out and now i am onto a new one. I think it's worth the investment for 3 years it's a pretty good case :) bisexual clear case girlies rise up",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this case for about a year now, and it has been super-duper protective. Although it is a bit chunkier than your average wildflower, or silicon cases, it is worth it not to get any cracks on your phone.Nevertheless, it is still pretty slim, and the glitter on the back is really pretty. As the back is a hard plastic, it does not yellow, however the siliconish/soft-plastic sides with the volume and power buttons do.The only real downside that I can think of is that the back is prone to scratches. However, this isn't really a big issue as, visually, it isn't really visible because of all the glitter, but if you run your finger over the backside you will feel it, and if you look close enough you will see it.In conclusion, I really recommend this case and I think it is worth the price. It doesn't look that protective when you first put it on, but when you drop it a few times, you'll be glad you bought it!Hope this helps some fellow buyers.",

The pros I found areFits perfectly to the phone.Makes the phone look more robust.ITs drop safe - so feel secure after putting it on the phone.The cover allows to use the buttons normally .Have used it for couple of months with little precautions and it is scratch free ( by little precautions i mean avoide putting it on abrasive surfaces / or do not put the phone and keys in the same pocket)Cons :It makes the phone little bulky - but its ok as long it makes the phone safe.Its expensive but at the same time it gives you peace of mind.Hope it helps you in making a decision !",
