I'm giving it a four-star rating because no instructions were included and this is my first phone case. Also put the screen protector on first and had to realign it several times afterwards to get it to fit right. Screen protector is actually a bit shorter than the actual screen which is minor, but still, an annoyance. I do like the credit card slot on the back as I recently went on a field trip with my daughter's class and didn't want to to drag a purse along. Card stayed in place securely despite having the phone in and out of my pocket.",
