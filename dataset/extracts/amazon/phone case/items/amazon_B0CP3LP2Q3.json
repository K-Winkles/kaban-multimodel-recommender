                "reviewText": "I have a number of cases; some don't allow any magnetic charger/accessory to charge or stick to the back, others allow a charge but have a weak magnetic bond. This one cleverly incorporates a ring of magnets around the charging disk so it produces an incredibly strong bond - you can pick up the phone by the charger and it won't even shake off. I like that! They claim that charging is faster because the back is thinner - I haven't tested that but it seems likely to be true.The phone fit in the case easily and well. They don't include any protective screens, which is fine (the ones sold independently are easier to properly apply than the ones that typically come with a case) however you should always have a glass screen protector on your iPhone, so don't overlook that. It only takes one fall in the wrong angle on the wrong surface to kill an unprotected screen, and this case alone won't save you from that.For some reason they included some cute stickers!",

                "reviewText": "As someone who is always on the lookout for the best phone case for my iPhone, I was truly impressed with the performance and features of this iPhone 12 Pro case. First and foremost, its magnetic capabilities are outstanding. It seamlessly works with a variety of MagSafe accessories, securely attaching them without the slightest hint of detachment. Ensuring that all my accessories stay firmly in place during use, even when the phone is subjected to a bit of shaking or twisting. Charging efficiency is impressive, and there's no fear of any accessory slipping or falling off. The price is great based on how many unofficial MagSafe cases I\u2019ve already owned and get bad very fast or the magnet is horrible making the phone get very hot, so in the end you pay much more independently.but this Yezioo iphone 12 Pro case i think will be a better choice to repalce iPhone 12 Pro offical case.The camera lens protection is a significant advantage of this case. The lens cover and raised bezel around the camera provide a robust defense against potential scratches and dings, all while maintaining the quality of the photos I capture. It's a great relief knowing that my phone's camera lens is protected without compromising the photo quality.Thank you for providing such an exceptional phone case and outstanding customer service. It has been a pleasure to do business with you, and I look forward to future opportunities to engage with your brand.",

It comes with some stickers for your kids!Construction seems good and the feel of the satin touch is really nice. The back part is semi-transparent som it looks more like a grey and black cover for my particular device. Buttons are really nice, too, as the are close to the surface of the cover and will not snag on things. Feel really good and function perfectly.I'm a stickler for covers that aren't overly bulky. I don't want to increase the overall size of my phone much and would say this cover does the trick. I've had some that are slimmer and many that are bulky. This one comes in closer to the slimmer versions.",
