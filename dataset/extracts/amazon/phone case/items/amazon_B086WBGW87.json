I liked that it\u2019s clear, so my iPhone color shows through (it\u2019s the lavender/purple one).It\u2019s pretty sturdy, while being slim enough as if you almost didn\u2019t have a case on your phone, and allows for easy use if all your buttons (including the back of the phone icon that turns your phone on).It\u2019s easy to put on and take off, so I can clean my phone every so often, and the case itself.I\u2019ve dropped my phone a couple times (not hard, but still a drop) on hardwood floors and it withstand the impact, no damage to any part of my iPhone. It has a slight lip on the screen side (just its thickness), which keeps the front off the counter if you were placing it face down, hence protect it if it fell that way. Same with the back camera.Over time it will probably yellow a bit, but I\u2019ve had it a while now, and it\u2019s still looking great, so I think you\u2019ll get a new phone before you need to change the case out. \ud83d\ude09I only wish it came with a carry or clip on case, like other otter boxes, as I don\u2019t like to put phone in my pocket, so I\u2019d rather clip to my belt or my handbag.Being clear, it can work for anyone, gender, age etc as its basically just a cover for your phone and whatever color your phone is, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see.Thumbs up for me.",

This particular case does not support the MagSafe charging, in that it will not stick to the vertical chargers. I replaced this case for one that advertised that it would not yellow and is compatible with MagSafe charging. Unfortunately it was not Otterbox/Lifeproof.",

It protects just enough while looking good and being flexible and able to be removed when necessary. Works with my glass screen protector too without restricting it or touching it. It has a subtle, though firm, silicone feel on the side as well for easy grip, and the clear window in the back means you see the factory look of the phone.Highly recommended!",
