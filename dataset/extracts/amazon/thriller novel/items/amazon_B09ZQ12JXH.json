With so many of the current detective series about serial killers, a gritty one murder with a real detective, sounded good. The story was very well done and developed at the right speed. The characters were interesting and all (mostly) played well into the story. I loved the twists and the ending was good, but unfulfilling. That said, it was a goodcread. A 4.4 out of 5 rating.",
