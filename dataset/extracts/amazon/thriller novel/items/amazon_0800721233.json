                "reviewText": "If I had known I would have read it so much sooner. The description just touches the surface of this book that introduces the Phoenix Private Detective Agency. This promises to be another wonderful series from Irene Hannon featuring three former law enforcement officers (homicide detective, ATF, Secret Service). They've seen too many cases fall through the cracks during their former careers and have come together to form a detective agency that focuses on justice. Each with skills, contacts, and resources that reach into their past, together they form a formidable force for justice.The story is well written and edited with characters that become living persons in your mind. Research is evident in the realism of limits, proper procedure and time constraints when processing evidence. It never becomes mundane and boring nor does it trail off into unfinished side stories to hook you into the next book. The scenes are vividly depicted, conversation flows naturally and there are no obvious logistical errors. The romance has some definite '...sigh' moments yet remains clean. There is a light to moderate Christian thread that is well done. At no time does the reader feel as if they are being preached at, the characters lives reflect their beliefs.The only draw back for me is the price of the next book. I really want to read it. Spending ten dollars on a digital book is right up there with spending six dollars on a cup of coffee. I read at least one kindle unlimited, free, or budget reduced book a day and make my own coffee. Honestly? I'll probably blow half my monthly book allowance on that one book. If it's as good as this one I'll be reading it again and again. Okay... I've just talked talked myself into it... I'm getting it... now... I'll write a review on it tomorrow.",

                "reviewText": "My Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.Disclaimers: I bought a copy of this novel and then found out it was on Netgalley. I requested it through Netgalley and that same day I got a copy in the mail.Basically, I wanted to read it and then received a temporary e-galley from the publisher via Netgalley but I didn't read that copy. I'd still like to thank the publisher and Netgalley, however.My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: I love Irene Hannon. I've read every single one of her romantic suspense novels and have loved every single one of them.However, when I saw the synopsis of this one, I was worried. I just didn't feel as drawn to this story. I bought it simply because it was Irene Hannon. I went in with low expectations.I should have known better. This is Irene Hannon we're talking about. I absolutely adored this novel. Hannon's writing is always captivating. From the very first page, I was hooked. I stayed up super late and finished this in one setting because I just couldn't put it down.The chemistry between Moira and and Cal was undeniable. Cal's wife had died five years ealier and he still wasn't over her and yet he couldn't deny his feelings for Moira. There was also the fact that she was a client and he doesn't get involved with clients.The suspense was also intriguing. Even though, I figured out what was going on fairly early, its was still gripping. I love how Hannon lets you delve into the villain's mind and see his motives and rationale for his actions. It makes for an incredible read.In Summary: Irene Hannon is a queen at suspense. She writes gripping stories that leave you on the edge of your seats and fills them with complex characters who practically spring off the pages. Hannon is easily one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.Warnings/Side-note: This novel isn't at all offensive and is quite clean. However, the subject matter is dark at times and targeted for adults. Teens could read these books and love them, but I wouldn't recommend them for young teens.The Wrap-Up: A beautiful, gripping read that I devoured. Hannon is truly an incredible writer whom I adore. The Christian elements are never overdone. If you love romantic suspense, then give this one a shot. And if you love Christian romantic suspense, then this book as well as any by this author is for you.",

                "reviewText": "I love this book because I like Irene Hannon's writing and story lines. She is up there with Dee Henderson in my books! Great plot, believable characters. She takes time to build up the story, characters and suspense. Sometimes you don't have to be guessing to be on the edge of your seat. I have all her books now and love everyone of them.",
