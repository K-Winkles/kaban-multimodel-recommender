        "description": "The year is 1939.The first few months of the Second World War. In England, the air crews of R.A.F Brinstead are readying themselves for the fight ahead.But their commanders have yet to master the brutal realities of this conflict.Bomber squadrons are being sent on daylight reconnaissance and tasked with attacking enemy shipping - and with neither the fighter protection or the firepower to protect themselves from the Luftwaffe.Many of them have little chance of surviving the terrible barrage from the warships' anti-aircraft guns.Flight Sergeant Peter Wheldon is determined to beat the odds and fly his crew safely through each operation.But these early sorties often suffered appalling casualties.And when night raids are added to the bomber crews' burden, Wheldon knows it\u2019ll be hard to get anyone out alive when they are subjected to dangers which will never again be exceeded in the war's six hectic years\u2026Bombing Run is a full-throttle WWII fighter pilot adventure story, rich in authentic period detail. It is perfect for fans of Alistair MacLean and Jack Higgins.'A thrilling page turner.' - Tom Kasey, best-selling author of 'Trade Off'.Richard Townshend Bickers volunteered for the RAF on the outbreak of the second world war and served, with a Permanent Commission, for eighteen years. He wrote a range of military fiction and non-fiction books, including \u2018Torpedo Attack\u2019, \u2018My Enemy Came Nigh\u2019 and \u2018Summer of No Surrender\u2019. Read more",
