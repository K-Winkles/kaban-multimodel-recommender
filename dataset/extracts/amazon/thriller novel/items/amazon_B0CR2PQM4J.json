It destroyed 6 men and trying to get justice from the legal system is a slap in the face.Read the book and don't judge Samson like I did for his faults at the beginning, try to see it through his eyes!",

I\u2019m not an English major but it was a bit distracting to quite often have to stop and rearrange the words in a sentence for it to make sense. I can\u2019t put all the blame on him (aren\u2019t there editors, etc. for that???), which is why I\u2019m going to download another of his books!!",

My bestie Joanne found this book and it reminded me of the 2015 Keanu Reeves movie called Knock Knock.Earned Double Kindle Rewards on this purchase.The first half of the book was way too unbelievable, even for a fiction thriller. A former military killer can\u2019t escape 2, seemingly average, unarmed, untrained women. I almost gave up. I\u2019m hoping the second half of this book will redeem itself. The second half was better; mental health/PTSD treatment, a committed lawyer and final payback. Could have received a higher rating if the first half of this 400 page book was cut by 100 pages. I would try another read by this author.",

Not only was I right, but the whole premise was ridiculous. I have no patience with someone who makes so many stupid mistakes while trying to escape a situation and this guy made plenty! There is fairly graphic sex which I don\u2019t have much of a problem with, but this just went on and on to the point that I started skipping ahead. I\u2019m sorry to say that I finally gave up and didn\u2019t even finish the book. It was simply too much of a bad thing. I could not tell you how many years it\u2019s been since nice I\u2019ve left a book unfinished. That speaks volumes. I honestly would not recommend this read at all. I want to add that the entire first half reads like a young man\u2019s letter to Penthouse magazine. Just too over the top.",

                "reviewText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Don't Open The Door by Cole Baxter is a suspenseful psychological thriller that will make you look at some situations differently!Trigger warning: Sexual abuse, torture, mental breakdown.I believe this book is a great example of discrimination based on stereotypes! Example of how authorities tell us one thing but once it becomes reality no one will listen or do anything!This is a book about trust and betrayal! About breaking down and healing. This is a book about true friendship and deep trust. This is a book about how not to give up.Some parts of this book are so descriptive that it will cause distress if you are sensitive but it's possible to skip it without losing the contest of what is happening.Samson is a happily married writer with all his life nicely lined up. It all changes in one evening when he opens the door to two young sisters asking for help.This is the beginning of disaster and losing everything. Sometimes the biggest loss is losing support from those who must be there for us. Once this is gone you are left with the question - where is the point?This is a heavy book, it's not a traditional psychological thriller, there is a good portion of thought process and mental healing through understanding.This definitely is a fast peace thriller at the same time you will need a break to process or to simply breathe!",
