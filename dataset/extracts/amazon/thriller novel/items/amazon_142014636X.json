The story grabbed my interest within the first page and kept it throughout. The setting just added to the story, it was the perfect package for a creepy Christmas thriller. My main con is the author repeated\u2026. A lot! It wasn\u2019t chapters or even pages apart either it was sentences apart that she wrote almost word for word what she\u2019d just written. Just a pet peeve of mine and probably not noticeable to most. It didn\u2019t hinder the story at all just an fyi for those who find things like that annoying. Anyway\u2026 I\u2019ll be reading more from this author.",

I had no clue who to trust and definitely no idea who was the ravenous murderer.The book was unique in the way it was laid out. I enjoyed the characters very much. I actually trusted zero of them. Even Kara at one point. The relationships between characters were relatable and drew you in.Though I think the middle kind of lost me for a minute. The re-telling of the famous night gets a little old after a while. Then some weird stuff happened near the end and I was like wth for a moment. Almost a little unbelievable and rushed at some point. I feel like this had the makings of a 5\ud83c\udf1f book.",

Psychologie und Motive des T\u00e4ters und Beteiligten wenig plausibel. \u00dcberhaupt bleiben die Personen blass. Stattdessen seitenlanges uninteressantes F\u00fcllmaterial, z.B was die Nachrichten gerade bringen w\u00e4hrend der Cop im Keller \u00fcber 40 minutenlang trainiert. Wiederholungen, als h\u00e4tte Autor vergessen, dass sie das nur kurz vorher schon beschrieben hatte. (Z.B. denkt Protagonistin dar\u00fcber nach, dass sie nicht wei\u00df, wann sie zuletzt was zu essen hatte au\u00dfer K\u00e4se und cracker um kurz darauf wieder die genau dasselbe zu denken, als der Lieferdienst endlich kommt). Das ist schlicht nervig, langweilig und l\u00e4sst einen fragen, ob es \u00fcberhaupt sowas wie Beta-reader, geschweige denn ein Lektorat gegeben hat. Die Kindle-Version der englischen Fassung ist zudem durchsetzt von falschen (wahrscheinlich manuell gesetzten) Seitenumbr\u00fcchen und Worttrennungen, was den Lesefluss definiert st\u00f6rt durch die ungewollten Abs\u00e4tze, die so entstehen. Scheint generell ein Problem zu sein bei digitalen Kindle Fassungen. Kann mal bitte eine Schulung an Autoren rausgehen \u00fcber Text Formatierung? !!!",
