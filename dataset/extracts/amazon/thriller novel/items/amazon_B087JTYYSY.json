This one took me longer to get into due to many moving parts & pieces that seemed a bit disconnected. However, when the story lines merged this one became a great thriller as well.Looking forward to reading Quinn & Costa Book 3.",

                "reviewText": "I loved Tell No Lies by Allison Brennan, the second book in her Quinn and Costa series. Tell No Lies kept me on the edge of my seat and up many late nights reading. Allison Brennan as once again proven that she is a wonderful storyteller who always delivers truly page turning thrillers. I loved every page and could not put it down. Tell No Lies is filled with all those things that we have come to love and expect in a Allison Brennan thriller. Especially the poignant and bittersweet moments that filled this page turner, and the many surprise plot-twists. Tell No Lies is the story of the newly created D.C. based FBI mobile response team, under the leadership of Mathias \"Matt\" Costa, and team members: L.A. detective Kara Quinn, white-collar crimes expert Zack Heller, team analyst Ryder Kim, veteran Navy SEAL Michael Harris, and forensics expert Jim Esteban. The team is in Patagonia, Arizona trying to solve the murder case of Emma Perez. The investigation starts with the premise of illegal dumping of slag by Southwest Copper. Kara is working undercover as a bartender at The Wrangler, the local bar and Michael is working his first undercover case inside Southwest Copper. Matt is working with Joe Molina, the son of the owner of Southwest Copper, John Molina. The case takes some surprise twists and turns, and it ends up being so much more that illegal dumping. I love how the team is able to gather the information and connect all the pieces of the case together to find the killer and what is really going on in Patagonia. I love that there is a hint of a relationship between Matt and Kara. Cannot wait to see what happens between them in the coming books. Like all of Allison Brennan's, Tell No Lies is filled with incredible characters, thrilling plot twists and unexpected turns of events. I really love everything about this series and cannot wait for the upcoming books in the series. Allison Brennan continues to amaze me with her writing and to deliver incredible thrillers. Highly recommend this thriller.",

From some real profound experiences for some characters and a look at a couple of major issues that actually happen to people all the way through the characters that I now love. I was looking for a book to read but I found a series I must have. And since I am going on a pre-planned camping trip to Patagonia, Arizona tomorrow, I am going to tell everyone there that I see about this. And downloading the other books in the series. A wonderful job by Allison Brennan.",

The setting is desert landscape, so it\u2019s all dirt and run down buildings. Definitely not my favorite book by this author.",

                "reviewText": "I love this new series by Allison Brennan, Third to Die was a brilliant introduction to the mobile response team and Tell No Lies is an equally brilliant second book. The story is full of twists and turns and what starts of as a simple murder case soon becomes something far more complex for Matt Costa and his team. The story flows wonderfully and I love the way all the team play their part, it\u2019s also great that the chemistry between Matt and Kara isn\u2019t really focused on, it\u2019s just m entioned in passing. A fascinating complex twisty turny suspense novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the last page",
