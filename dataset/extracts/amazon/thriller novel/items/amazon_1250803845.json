I was thoroughly impressed, and that led me to read THIS book. I felt like I had the upper hand this time... Going into it knowing the reveal wasn't gonna be what I expected. So I started thinking of even crazier explanations and conclusions. Then I started doubting myself when things seemed to unfold in the most obvious way, only to realize I was duped once again, and my assumptions were wrong. I LOVE when the author can out-smart me, and Stacy Willingham has done it brilliantly, twice now. Kudos to her. She has my respect.",

                "reviewText": "Chloe Davis has had a difficult life. Being the daughter of a man in prison for a series of murders has made her leery to trust. She was very close to her father and can\u2019t believe that he is capable of taking so many lives. Having a difficult childhood where her and her brother are abandoned by her father who goes to jail, her mother who tried to take her own life and now is in a mental facility, and years of trauma she\u2019s trying to rebuild her life. It\u2019s been 20 years since the horrific events she endured in Louisiana but now it seems that things may be starting up again. She\u2019s trying to find happiness with her fianc\u00e9 Daniel however, her brother thinks that there is something off about him. Can Chloe really trust herself? Can she really trust believing in people given what was going on that she didn\u2019t realize 20 years ago? Enter reporter Aaron Jansen who is poking around and now Chloe isn\u2019t sure what is real and what is not. She\u2019s a medical psychologist, but you soon find that she has all of these hidden issues, she\u2019s just barely hanging on herself. What does she discover when she truly looks in the mirror and at her own life? I thought that the author did a very good job of making Chloe complicated and complex. There are so many layers to the character and so many things that you stop and wonder about and question. While I did figure out what was going on in one sense pretty early on there were some twists that I never saw coming. This was an excellent psychological thriller with incredible depth. This is the second book I\u2019ve read by this author and I cannot wait to read her newest release.",

                "reviewText": "A book that\u2019s excellent in parts, although our main character, Chloe, a hypervigilant woman with skills in psychology, comes across as surprisingly dense with any of the men in her life. Why does she think her fianc\u00e9 has her best interests at heart? He\u2019s a jerk. As a reader, the question for me, was whether her insensitive fianc\u00e9\u2019s behaviour was a bunch of red herrings for the reader to get lost in, or is he in fact a copycat killer? What about her brother, or the reporter, or the cops?A satisfying read, with a nicely plotted twist. Unfortunately for me, I saw the twist right from the start, but kept on reading to find out if that\u2019s how the story panned out. Definitely worth reading.",
