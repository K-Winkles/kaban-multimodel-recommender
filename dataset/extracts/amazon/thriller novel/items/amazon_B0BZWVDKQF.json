Everything you need for a five-star reading experience is in this book.Let\u2019s talk about THE FURY!In THE FURY we are following a group of friends on a private Greek Island called Aura. Lana Farrar, the ex-movie star, has invited her very close friends to unwind and relax over Easter weekend.By the end of the weekend, plans unravel, secrets are revealed, and someone ends up dead. We learn the who, the what, and most importantly the why, in this spectacular \u201cWHYDUNIT\u201d by Alex Michaelides, out January 2024!I spent a weekend reading THE FURY. The first thing I noticed was how intentional the writing was. Thought and time and care went into thinking about what the words were saying, where the sentence was landing, and how the reader was experiencing the book.I had a spectacular and unforgettable reading experience.Just as the painting was in THE SILENT PATIENT, so is the wind in the fury. It\u2019s a non-human entity that acts much like a character. It interacts with the scene; it has its own behavior and becomes just as vocal and informative as the dialogue between characters.There are elements carried over from both THE SILENT PATIENT and THE MAIDENS. THE FURY is synergistic and felt like the culmination of something bigger than itself.The sum of many parts.There is something here for every reader out there and will be particularly compelling for die-hard thriller fans. This is the one you\u2019ve been waiting for.I cannot wait to hear this as an audiobook and I\u2019m 100% rereading this with you when it comes out in January 2024.Finally, again a book by Michaelides well worth the price of admission.If this is the show, I want a ticket!THE FURY...\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThanks to Celadon Books for the advanced copy and the awesome opportunity to provide early feedback!",

The night ended in violence and death, as one of us was found murdered. But who am I? My name is Elliot Chase, and I\u2019m going to tell you a story unlike any you\u2019ve ever heard.REVIEW :First two books by this author were The Maidens (\u201821 - 3 Stars) and The Silent Patient ('19 - 5 Stars).I love how this author\u2019s writing pulls you in, even if there\u2019s not much going on and wraps you up so you can\u2019t stop reading. During this authors interview on Good Morning America, he said he wrote this book totally different; he had no plan. He wanted to flip the murder mystery with stranded guests on an island plot on its head with lots of twists. At 50%, it\u2019s only the flow of the author\u2019s words that is keeping me reading; plot - not so much. The last 50% was very predictable for me; a couple of turns but nothing shocking. If you like murder mysteries, you might like this one more than me. I went with 3 stars for the author\u2019s writing ALONE! If he didn\u2019t have such a way with words, this book might have gotten 2 stars. If only he could find another plot as good as The Silent Patient - I\u2019ll keep hoping !",

That just isn\u2019t the nature of this book, in my opinion. It\u2019s a glass onion, and then there were none type mystery with a playwright twist on it. It\u2019s narrated in the first person, which gives it a conversational nature\u2014especially considering the fourth wall breaks. The chapters are short and quick, so I would recommend to any glass onion fans looking for a quick mystery.",

                "reviewText": "A generous 4 stars.A slow start and a story filled with beautiful descriptions of places and food that made me wish to take the next flight back to Greece.I simultaneously listened to the audiobook. The audiobook had more words than my paperback edition.Here is a simple example:Book: \u201cA small figure was\u2026\u201dAudiobook: \u201c There was a small figure\u2026\u201dBook: \u201cThat the guns\u2026\u201dAudiobook: \u201c The fact that the guns\u2026\u201dBook: some times a pronoun was usedAudiobook: that pronoun was substituted by the character\u2019s name.Anyways, those differences were not a big deal but I thought I should mention.I thought that this book was much better than \u201cThe Maidens\u201d, but not as thrilling as \u201cThe Silent Patient\u201d.I enjoyed the writing and specially the narrative, but the development of the storyline was very slow.Regardless, I did find it very atmospheric, hence my ratings.The chapters are very short and well constructed, but no characters are likeable and unfortunately I did not connect with a single one.As for the narrator, there was no way that he could have known everything.Paperback (Celadon Books): 299 pages (or 320 pages if cover to cover - so many empty pages and spaces - I felt cheated). It\u2019s divided into 5 acts, and most of the chapters are very short.ebook (Kobo): 217 pages (default), 67k wordsaudiobook narrated by Alex Jennings: 8.1 hours (normal speed)",

                "reviewText": "\u201cThe Fury\u201d by Alex Michaelides is not your routine novel. It teases you from one question to the next: from a whodunit, to what happened exactly and to why it all happened; It does so while answering some fundamental questions about relationships in general, and the lasting effects of childhood trauma on shaping an individual in particular.It is one of the most nonlinear story plots that I have read. The nonlinearity amuses the readers without losing them in between the subplots. The first person narrative occasionally makes you feel a bit annoyed, but that cost comes at the benefit of revealing the story twists beautifully.This is by far the best of Alex\u2019s three novels to date: The silent patient was brilliant; The maidens was good. The Fury can easily become a cult classic.To enjoy the novel thoroughly, you have to give in to the narrative: the protagonist asks you to sit besides him on a bar stool, sip a drink with him and listen to his story. Yield and you will be treated to a lovely story. Start saying \u201cWTF, why can\u2019t he just tell the story straight?\u201d, you will lose him. Humor him and enjoy his tale.The novel reminds you - unabashedly of course - of a lot of other stories, but holds its ground in being unique in the story-unraveling technique.Dr. M.S.S. Mukharjee.",
