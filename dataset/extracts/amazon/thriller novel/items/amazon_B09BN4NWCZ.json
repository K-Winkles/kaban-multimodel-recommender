                "reviewText": "Aloysius Archer is the main character in the series who has been working to become a licensed private investigator. Archer is the name most of the other characters in the stories know him as, even his boss Willie Dash. Now Archer has a new case, and it may be the death of him yet! While in Hollywood, Archer attends an event with his friend, Liberty Callahan, when he is asked by Eleanor Lamb to find out who wants her dead.The next thing Archer knows is Lamb has gone missing, and a body is found in her home. Archer feels out of his element as he must ask many of Lamb\u2019s wealthy friends for information. However, they are less than helpful and in fact bring even more confusion to the mystery of Lamb\u2019s whereabouts. Through many twists and turns in the plot, Archer must find out where Lamb went and who killed the man found in her home. While doing his job, Archer is finding out how he really feels about Callahan and if they do indeed have a future as a couple.All that glitters is not gold in the movie world as Archer finds out. In fact, it has quite the dark side to it and if light were to shine, many a celebrity would be ruined. Archer doesn\u2019t care to bring the light, just hopefully find Lamb alive and if possible, help someone out of a tight spot. With a web of mystery, murder and intrigue, Archer delves into the depravity with the hopes of living through a cesspool of villains out to protect their evil empire no matter the cost.I enjoyed reading another Archer tale though some of the aspects of the book were unnecessary additions to the story line. The author weaves an intriguing mystery that leaves readers turning pages until the \u201cwho done it\u201d is revealed. The ending of the book leaves me wondering if this is the end of the Archer series as loose ends from previous books seemed to be tied up quite nicely. I thought the author did a great job of taking his audience back into the 1950s era, which was a nice change from other books he has written.I look forward to the other books coming out this year by Baldacci: The 6:20 Man in July 2022, followed by Long Shadows in October.",

Aloysius Archer is the protagonist private eye, hired to solve a case. But there are a myriad other characters as antagonists such that I did not recall each ones part in the narrative.It seemed to me that the story line was more a picture puzzle that needed to be constructed in order for the plot to make sense. Each antagonist was a piece of the puzzle, i.e., information for Archer to add together to solve a murder and locate a missing person. But along the way, I lost which character\u2019s piece of information added to the \u201cpuzzle\u201d story line as a whole. The book was a period piece about the movie business, and the celebrities working in that business in Hollywood California circa 1953. That, of itself, made the read somewhat interesting in that I used to live in LA, albeit not in that era. But saying that, I did not get much else out of the read. I do not retell story lines in my reviews.Although I have read other of Baldacci\u2019s books about this character, in summary, I find I am not much of a fan of the \u201cArcher\u201d character, or the story lines of the books he is in.",
