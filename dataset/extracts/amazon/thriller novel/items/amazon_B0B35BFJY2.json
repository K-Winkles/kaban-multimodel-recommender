                "reviewText": "These were excellent in 1986; in 2023, they leave something to be desired.No, I'm not talking about answering machines, the lack of cell phones, or the other anachronisms that end up feeling just a bit out of place.It's the actual PLOT, especially of the second novel, that really struggles. So much so, it's tough at times to stay embedded in the story, even when you are well familiar with how things like parental kidnappings were handled in the 80s. Today, law enforcement would be involved. Given history of domestic abuse, the visitation might well have be limited, if not supervised, instead of handing the kids off for entire weekends at a time. Nationwide agreement on the enforceability of child custody means that merely taking the children to another state gets the abducting parent off the hook. It might have even engendered an Amber Alert.Still, the writing and storyline and dynamics between the main characters are interesting, which pulls you along until you're jolted out of the story with what feels like - to a modern reader - totally unrealistic plot choices.Both titles could really have used a modern refresh before re-release. The first title isn't quite so jarring, but there are still moments where the reader wants to smack the characters... at least until you remember that these characters lived in the 1980s, and the world really has moved on since then.Also, there are a few very small continuity errors, which really aren't a big deal. Unless, like me, you're already being shook due to the Oh Yeah, These Books Are OLD moments.",

I can't even describe the stupidity of arriving at the home of the non custodial parent, without notifying the local police department, and accepting the canard that regaining custody of the children would be too difficult on the children. The explanations and justifications do not hold water.Much as I enjoy Ms. Jackson's later work, I will be certain to avoid her earlier novels. This was a dud.",
