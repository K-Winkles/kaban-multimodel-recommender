        "description": "THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Named a summer book to watch by The Washington Post, Boston Globe, USA Today, Oprah, Paste, Country Living, Good Housekeeping, and Nerd Daily \"Propulsive ... a dizzying Gothic whodunit.\" \u2014New York Times Book Review Bestselling author Riley Sager returns with a Gothic chiller about a young caregiver assigned to work for a woman accused of a Lizzie Borden-like massacre decades earlier. At seventeen, Lenora Hope Hung her sister with a rope Now reduced to a schoolyard chant, the Hope family murders shocked the Maine coast one bloody night in 1929. While most people assume seventeen-year-old Lenora was responsible, the police were never able to prove it. Other than her denial after the killings, she has never spoken publicly about that night, nor has she set foot outside Hope\u2019s End, the cliffside mansion where the massacre occurred. Stabbed her father with a knife Took her mother\u2019s happy life It\u2019s now 1983, and home-health aide Kit McDeere arrives at a decaying Hope\u2019s End to care for Lenora after her previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. In her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, Lenora was rendered mute by a series of strokes and can only communicate with Kit by tapping out sentences on an old typewriter. One night, Lenora uses it to make a tantalizing offer\u2014I want to tell you everything. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Lenora said But she\u2019s the only one not dead As Kit helps Lenora write about the events leading to the Hope family massacre, it becomes clear there\u2019s more to the tale than people know. But when new details about her predecessor\u2019s departure come to light, Kit starts to suspect Lenora might not be telling the complete truth\u2014and that the seemingly harmless woman in her care could be far more dangerous than she first thought.

I read it within 24 hours and normally I can\u2019t read mystery/suspense/thriller books as the plot takes too long and I usually flip to the end and see what happens\u2026. But not with this book! It kept me guessing the entire time, enough turns that you think you know what happened- but you don\u2019t\u2026 not until the very end.The story telling is fantastic and kept me engaged the entire time. Typically I can guess a plot line but I trusted the author to keep my guessing and I\u2019m glad that I did.I read, \u201cThe last time I lied\u201d by the author during a winter storm that we were stuck inside and the story telling was the same. Enough to keep me guessing and intrigued. So much so that I bought this book and one more by the author.I loved \u201cThe last time I lied\u201d but love this one even more. I have a new favorite author!!You won\u2019t be disappointed!",

This story centers on the murders of three family members in 1929 and then details the next fifty years, into the 1970s. Alternating in time, the story considers what actually happened to each family member/story character. All sorts of theories exist but nothing can anticipate the story\u2019s final outcome 50+ years later. Although there were moments that felt implausible, the story unfolds in a riveting manner and the intricacies of the storyline and characters\u2019 lives make for an incredibly intriguing and engaging story.",

                "reviewText": "This was a pretty fun book and a great premise for a mystery. The gothic house, long ago murder mystery and spooky characters make it a very compelling read. The protaganist, Kit, is likeable but makes some pretty questionable moves throughout. She assumes that she has solved various facets of the mystery and jumps right in to make accusations or take action then it turns out she's wrong so off she goes in a different direction. I did not see some of the plot twists coming and that made it more fun. However, the coincidences and implausible timing throughout was a bit eye-rolliing and annoying at times. Still, this was a fun, readable book and I will likely read more by the author. I rated this book 4 out of 5 - good, solid, fast read that had it's issues but was still overall fun and enjoyable.",

                "reviewText": "I read this in one sitting, literally. I devoured it on a 4 hour flight on the way back from our holiday at the start of October. I\u2019d just finished Home Before Dark, another of Riley\u2019s novels. This one is completely different again to any of his other titles that I\u2019ve read and is a contender to be my favourite.This book is set in a crumbling cliffsidemansion with characters who honestly reminded me a little bit of Cluedo characters! The protagonist is Kit, who\u2019s a caregiver to the infamous owner of Hope\u2019s End Lenora. Lenora is introduced to Kit as mute and paralysed however all at Hope\u2019s End is definitely not as it seems.Throughout the narrative, there are letters written about the murders that took place at Hope\u2019s End which help to set the scene of the past alongside Kit trying to understand just who everyone is in the future.This was so full of twists and turns it was unreal! I had absolutely no inclination that the book was going to end the way it did and I mean this had me on my toes right until the last chapter.",
