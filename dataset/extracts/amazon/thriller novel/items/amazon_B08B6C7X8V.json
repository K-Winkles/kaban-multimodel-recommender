        "description": "\"The Last Flight is thoroughly absorbing - not only because of its tantalizing plot and deft pacing, but also because of its unexpected poignancy and its satisfying, if bittersweet, resolution. The characters get under your skin.\" (The New York Times Book Review) Two women. Two flights. One last chance to disappear. Claire Cook has a perfect life. Married to the scion of a political dynasty, with a Manhattan townhouse and a staff of 10, her surroundings are elegant, her days flawlessly choreographed, and her future auspicious. But behind closed doors, nothing is quite as it seems. That perfect husband has a temper that burns as bright as his promising political career, and he's not above using his staff to track Claire's every move, making sure she's living up to his impossible standards. But what he doesn't know is that Claire has worked for months on a plan to vanish. A chance meeting in an airport bar brings her together with a woman whose circumstances seem equally dire. Together they make a last-minute decision to switch tickets - Claire taking Eva's flight to Oakland, and Eva traveling to Puerto Rico as Claire. They believe the swap will give each of them the head start they need to begin again somewhere far away. But when the flight to Puerto Rico goes down, Claire realizes it's no longer a head start but a new life. Cut off, out of options, with the news of her death about to explode in the media, Claire will assume Eva's identity, and along with it, the secrets Eva fought so hard to keep hidden. For fans of Lisa Jewell and Liv Constantine, The Last Flight is the story of two women - both alone, both scared - and one agonizing decision that will change the trajectory of both of their lives.

He is dangerous, and she has so far been unable to leave him.Eva is a former chemistry major who now produces methamphetamine in her basement. She hates this life but feels stuck in it and unable to escape.They meet in an airport and trade identities. This is how each can leave her old life behind.Most of the book is told in dual timelines. One is Eva's backstory; the other tells of Claire's experiences as Eva, her new identity.The title of this book may lead you to believe that it is about an airline flight. Yet, you won't know for sure if Eva got on that ill-fated flight until the end.And in the end, will EITHER survive? You'll be rooting for both.",

                "reviewText": "The last flight was a nice Lifetime Movie read. It follows Clara and Eva who switched plane tickets in the airport , both running from someone in their lives . It took me a week and a half to push through a his book because I didn\u2019t care for Eva. This book has both characters pov in what lead up to the switch and Eva was not likable . Clara was running from a DV marriage and Eva made some bad choices and decided to run and pass her life off on someone else. That bothered me. I felt like I was reading to completely different books at times and had to push through it was tough. The author wanted us to feel sympathy for both ladies because they had both lost parents, but that wasn\u2019t the same each. They were from different sides of the tracks and it just didn\u2019t mesh well for a storyline. Eva was selfish, I get how hard her life was blah, blah, blah.. but that don\u2019t mean she it was okay to manipulate Clara . She scammed her way into that and hurt someone close to her. Her character was flat outside from her selfishness. The writing itself was beautifully written. I think Julie Clark did well with bringing awareness to DV without romanticizing it and Clara\u2019s story alone is what made me give this 4 stars. Had this been Eva\u2019s story alone.I wouldn\u2019t have read it .",

I just wanted to keep reading and find out what happened with Claire, and with Eva, and did either or both of them find the escape they were looking for.The writer was so talented I could experience their fear, their desperation. It was like I was an unobserved eavesdropper on the six months prior to the last flight.And just when you thought you knew what was going to happen, there\u2019s a curve ball hit out of the park and your left gasping in astonishment!I definitely recommend this book 1000% and you don\u2019t start it when you have obligations and responsibilities that need to be met. You\u2019re not going to want to put this down until you hit the very last page!",

Sin embargo, cuando avanza la historia siento q falto un poco de profundidad en los sucesos finales. Lo le\u00eda en 1 semana. Es buen libro, recomendable",
