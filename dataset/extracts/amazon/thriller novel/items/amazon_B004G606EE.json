                "reviewText": "As a retired employee of Schering-Plough (now absorbed by Merck) company I can confirm the authenticity of many parts of this narrative.I retired just below the 'executive grade' calling myself a 'senior peon', actually a lab supervisor. At that level I have not been privy to shenanigans, some of them deadly, the author describes in the book. They may or may have not taken place at my company, I had no way of knowing. Even department heads probably did not know, their mutual communications may have been 'strongly discouraged' by the supreme leaders as described in the book.In addition, my parents were both hard working professionals, my mother a physician and my father a civil engineer. Their relationship was, to put it mildly, difficult although my mother was not as career oriented as the protagonist in the book.So, I am in a position of 'been there, done that' and in my 17th year of retirement I prefer not to think too much about most of my life, childhood with not quite compatible parents and adulthood inside a fairly large pharma company.Hence only three stars. Bit subjective, I know and perhaps unfair. People with backgrounds different from my own may enjoy it more and get some useful education about the world of hospital politics and reality of making medications.Just one detail: The author really knows what he is writing about describing the story of Valium. Our company during my years there (1980 - 1996) worked quite hard on two diazepin medications and finally, after many delays, the FDA approved both of them. To the credit of Schering-Plough, neither of them was actually marketed, there were just too many me-too Valiums out there already.",

                "reviewText": "While this may not have been my favorite Michael Palmer novel and it took a couple starts and stops for me to read it, once I got into it I did still really enjoy being pulled along in the story and by the end not wanting to stop reading to eat, sleep or do anything else. I just didn\u2019t get as emotionally invested in the characters as I usually do. I wasn\u2019t sure who was going to stick around, and who was worth pulling for at certain points in the book. But the big pharma, political and personal relationship plot lines were interesting and there was enough suspense involved to keep the sizzle snapping. At times I just felt something was missing along the way. I love Michael Palmer and I wish I could give this more stars but it was just not one of my favorites.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 4th Medical Suspense type novel by Michael Palmer. While admittedly I am a suspense/thriller freak, I must confess that out of over 30 different writers of this literary genre, I certainly grade Plamer\u2019s style, tope, unique and most interesting. While each story starts with a short \u2018background\u2019 prologue which becomes clear only quite late into the novel, each story is completely different without any resemblance or repetition to others by Palmer, a practice too common by most writers of this genre.A doctor himself by background, all Palmer\u2019s stories surround medical persons in a major eastern city in the US. But this concludes all resemblance among Palmer\u2019s medical suspense/thrillers. While he frequently uses medical terminology, they are used quite lightly and are always followed with layman\u2019s explanation. The mega-pharmaceutical company or super HMO company as well as their collaborators are often the villains, while a dedicated true-heart physician is the hero.In Side Effects, the hero is a dedicated pathologist and the villain is an old nazi biochemist, that escaped to the US and formulated the ultimate contraceptive. Another villain is the owner of a large drug company that wishes to acquire the monstrous drug.",

Paces his story line so unlike some other writers in the genre just seem like rhwy\u2019ve Become suddenly bored with the story and wrap up in 3 pages. Ending is as finely wrought as entire book.",
