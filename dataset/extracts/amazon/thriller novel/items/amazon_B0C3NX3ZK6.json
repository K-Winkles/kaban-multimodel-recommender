        "description": "This program features multicast narration. New York Times bestselling author Rachel Hawkins returns with a twisted new gothic suspense about an infamous heiress and the complicated inheritance she left behind. THERE\u2019S NOTHING AS GOOD AS THE RICH GONE BAD When Ruby McTavish Callahan Woodward Miller Kenmore dies, she\u2019s not only North Carolina\u2019s richest woman, she\u2019s also its most notorious. The victim of a famous kidnapping as a child and a widow four times over, Ruby ruled the tiny town of Tavistock from Ashby House, her family\u2019s estate high in the Blue Ridge Mountains. But in the aftermath of her death, her adopted son, Camden, wants little to do with the house or the money\u2014and even less to do with the surviving McTavishes. Instead, he rejects his inheritance, settling into a normal life as an English teacher in Colorado and marrying Jules, a woman just as eager to escape her own messy past. Ten years later, his uncle\u2019s death pulls Cam and Jules back into the family fold at Ashby House. Its views are just as stunning as ever, its rooms just as elegant, but the legacy of Ruby is inescapable. And as Ashby House tightens its grip on Jules and Camden, questions about the infamous heiress come to light. Was there any truth to the persistent rumors following her disappearance as a girl? What really happened to those four husbands, who all died under mysterious circumstances? And why did she adopt Cam in the first place? Soon, Jules and Cam realize that an inheritance can entail far more than what\u2019s written in a will\u2014and that the bonds of family stretch far beyond the grave. A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin\u2019s Press. Read more",

This family is toxic in the most entertaining way, and there are so many twists and betrayals to keep you hooked in the story. The letters were my favorite chapters, but I liked how the plot unfolded in the others. The audiobook had a good cast of narrators that really brought the characters to life, even if the accents were a little off at times.",

The Heiress focuses on the life and story of Ruby McTavish, through the perspectives of her letters, her son, Camden, and his wife, Jules. As the story unfolds, you realize that Cam and Jules's connection is deeper than their 10-year marriage. As the two return to Cam's home, the Ashby House, Jules learns more about the family that her husband tried to escape. The plot twists will grip you until you find yourself reading the final pages. I would rate this book 10 stars if I could. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

The North Carolina setting was perfect.. so atmospheric.. with the remote McTavish \u201cAshby House\u201d sitting amongst thick wooded forests and the rough terrain of the Blue Ridge Mountains giving this novel all the gothic feels.
