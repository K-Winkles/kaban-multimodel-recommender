        "description": "A daring CIA operation threatens chaos in the Kremlin. But can Langley trust the Russian at its center?CIA officers Sia and Max enter Russia under commercial cover to recruit Vladimir Putin\u2019s moneyman. Sia works for a London law firm that conceals the wealth of the superrich. Max\u2019s family business in Mexico\u2014a CIA front since the 1960s\u2014is a farm that breeds high-end racehorses. They pose as a couple to target Vadim, Putin\u2019s private banker, and his wife, Anna, who\u2014unbeknownst to CIA\u2014is a Russian intelligence officer under deep cover at the bank. As they descend further into a Russian world dripping with luxury and rife with gangland violence, Sia and Max\u2019s only hope may be Anna, who is playing a game of her own. Careening between the horse ranch in northern Mexico, the corridors of Langley, and the dark opulence of Putin\u2019s Russia, Moscow X is both a gripping thriller of modern espionage and a raw, unsparing commentary on the nature of truth, loyalty, and vengeance amid the shadow war between the United States and Russia.",

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for a high octane action spy thriller this book is not for you. If you are looking for an extremely well written, albeit sometimes tedious cerebral read you will like this fine novel. I like it but it does require the readers attention to catch all the subtle nuances.This is a story of two women.....are they cohorts or enemies? There is Sia, a CIA agent working as a lawyer at a bank in London that specializes in moving Russia's (Putins) money out of of Russia. There is Anna, A SVR secret agent married to the man responsible for moving the funds out of Russia who she hates. The two women first meet at an arranged horse ranch in Mexico where her husband wishes to purchases a stud stallion from Max the wealthy rancher.The tale moves onto Russia as Sia and Max are invited to visit the the Russians. So begins the story of the two women trying to use each other for different reasons, Sia to tap into Putin's money and steal it while Anna wants only recover millions in gold stolen from her imprisoned father and destroy her husband with bitter revenge. The interplay between the two women is fascinating as each tries to gain the advantage in this cerebral chess match of two minds. From the previous book Proctor is once again the manipulator behind the scenes but her role is almost comical and does not fit well in the story. This book is highly recommended as is Damascus Station, the author's debut novel that is perhaps even better than this one.",

                "reviewText": "MOSCOW X by David McCloskeyEvery so often, an author comes alone who sparks a flame\u2026 creates something new in their genre that will be read long after they are gone. In the cannon of espionage, these include John le Carr\u00e9, Graham Greene, Jason Matthews, Olen Steinhauer\u2026 the list is finite. Those who speak truth to the craft. Two years ago, David McCloskey secured his place with his debut, DAMASCUS STATION. With MOSCOW X, he reaffirms his skill and place among those giants.I\u2019ve often said, there is something truly special about a novel written by a former practitioner, and with regard to McCloskey, he defines this. His writing is sublime. The tail he spins is more than readable, but simply addictive. He nails the details in a way that reveals the clandestine world to those outside, and honors those that practice the secret craft. MOSCOW X is the stuff of an operations officers\u2019 dreams and nightmares, heady as they might be. McCloskey is the poet laureate of the clandestine world.McCloskey\u2019s characters \u2013 protagonists and antagonists \u2013 are richly layered and genuine. The operation, breathtakingly audacious, the sort of thing I wish our leaders would give consideration. The narrative, with all it\u2019s twists and turns, is all too believable. If you ever wondered what it would take to exfiltrate an officer from Russia\u2026 read this book. I cringed as my cortisol soared reading that segment.Simply excellent. I can\u2019t wait for THE SEVENTH FLOOR.",

                "reviewText": "Second novels always come with a high price tag: the publisher\u2019s requirements and reader\u2019s expectations are all waiting to ambush the writer\u2019s hopes.David McCloskey succeeds with Moscow X. At once similar and yet different than Damascus Station, in this novel he returns Artemis Proctor \u2014 the first chapter\u2019s explanation of why she now sits in the penalty box is worth reading alone \u2014 and dispatches two CIA non-official cover officers on a dangerous journey to subvert the powerful moneyman of the Russian President.It is a tale of cross and double-cross told in the best traditions of espionage thrillers of a dizzyingly complex operation that is all too real in his description.McCloskey\u2019s characters are human\u2014nuanced with traits the reader can love or hate\u2014the quandaries they face and the painful decisions they must make bring great depth to the story. As a former CIA officer, the tradecraft he infuses into the story is genuinely accurate and the 7th Floor\u2019s bureaucracy maddeningly real. A tale tightly woven with intermittent bursts of energy and calm until the final drive which takes the story on an breathless downhill race to a finish that leaves openings to continue the story.This book is superb, better in my opinion than Damascus Station, and fully establishes David in the Pantheon of the best spy writers.\u201d",

I have read both of his latest with some enjoyment and admiration, but the editing is sadly lacking. Clunky phrases everywhere, sometimes not comprehensible, even by a careful reader. And there are outright mistakes: a broodmare is said in the book to be \"out of\" her sire and a mare. Everybody knows that a horse is \"out of\" her dam (mare, mother) and \"by\" her sire. Overall, there's a good spy novel buried in there among the confusing and disorderly writing, and that's why we have editors.",

                "reviewText": "Moscow X is a complex tale of spycraft between the CIA and Russian agents that occurs in the US, Mexico, Russia and London. The story has many twists and turns and at times frustratingly slows to develop the complexities of the plot that involves financial maneuvers involving cryptocurrency and exchanges. The novel indicates deep knowledge of the dynamics involved in the conflicts between East and West that never make the news. Ultimately, Moscow X turns into a compelling and thrilling read that covers its mysteries until the climactic conclusions. I will look forward the next in the series having enjoyed this one along with Damascus Station.",

With regard to Damascus Stn, I found an intelligent, well informed setting, & not surprisingly, given the authors career background, insight into the corporate & individual protagonists mindset, organisational culture of a State Agency of dubious reputation (CIA).Characters in the main well crafted & captivating. My only reservation and common in this garndra, the romantic development, contrived, inevitable & on occasions , silly. Be that as it may, the plot, story telling, grit & pace is highly captivating.The second book, Moscow X, whilst not following Sam Joseph of the first, I found better, but that may be because of the Putin factor. I loved the female & unique lead of the lead character most quirky & entertaining. Great read, & looking forward to more from this author developing a reputation of the likes of Tom Clancy!",

                "reviewText": "Is this the same McCloskey that wrote Damascus Station, which was concise and paced without getting lost in immaterial details? What a letdown after so much expectation. The first few chapters of Moscow X are promising, but then descent into a very long preamble of over 150 pages to set the scene. Interesting maybe for horse trade lovers. It does not improve when one progresses further in the book and for me reading became a tedium which I could not finish, so half way through the book I chucked it, figuratively. McCloskey lost himself and struggled to get an interesting story together, which is a shame as Damascus Station was brilliant as a spy thriller in a lot of respects, Moscow X is an over-priced disappointment. The next scheduled installment in this series for release in 2025 is even priced 10% higher and based on current performance it is better off to be scrapped, at least I will not buy it unless severely discounted.",

However this follow up was painful the read, wordy uninteresting plot at one point I did not think I would be bothered finishing it. The multiple characters lacked the vibrancy of those from the debut novel, the plot was too long missing any thread of suspense or anticipation.Sorry David this was below par.It was reminiscent of the classic Russian novels in format and content.",
