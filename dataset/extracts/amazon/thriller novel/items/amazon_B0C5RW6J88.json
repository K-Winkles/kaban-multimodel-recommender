Delving into the human psyche and pulling out the inner workings of the mind is something she does with mystery and flair. A crazed woman who is manipulating others and the legal system is at the center of this complicated process. As the story unfolds and her fears are revealed, we begin to see what her fantasies have done to the unfortunate people who have crossed paths with her. But eventually her actions become her reality and she is forced to confront her part in this well thought out plan. Interesting and intriguing. Enjoy\u2026",
