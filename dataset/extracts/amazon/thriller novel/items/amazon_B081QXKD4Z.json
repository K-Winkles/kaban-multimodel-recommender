You may THINK you figure it out but WRONG...you do not.Jack is a great character. While he has some issues, HE IS NOT SO FLAWED YOU CAN NOT RELATE or like him. I find him interesting and just someone you FEEL FOR.Alice is a gem. She is everything you want a side kick to be WITH ISSUES, but again, NOT to the point you just don't connect with.AND WHO CAN FORGET LADY...the characterization of this dog is so great....The plot is thick and you just think you get a grip and you don't. You think you have it figured out, makes sense, but nope. AND SUCH AN INTRICATE SPIDER'S WEB.So sad I am out of this series now.....read them all and I want more.",

It would be more fun if they were an active team with distinct roles since she has hacking abilities. I may read the next novel but I\u2019m getting bored by the way the characters are falling into practicable roles. Jack can still be a hero even with a strong wife. It actually makes him more attractive not less.",

The suspense makes me want to go to the end of the book just to see who the guilt party is... but I don't!! And I'm always surprised. I would recommend reading all of Christopher Greyson's books.

I read a lot, and while I have read all of his books, I have read enough others since his last one came out that not all of his characters and their stories come immediately to mind. While I really liked that they all were included in this book, remembering the background of each played an important part in the plot. It would be confusing for someone who had not read the other books. While I like the continuation, I am disappointed when I read a book that requires following the series.The resolution caught me totally off guard, feeling almost robbed, in a way. I can't really explain without giving anything away, but it was a bit of a disappointment for me.Overall, while I'd like to give it 5 stars, I'm stopping at 4. I do recommend it, and look forward to the next adventure of Jack and Alice!",

His old partner is unconscious in an abandoned house and when Jack sees sketches of women covering the walls and one is Alice and a copy of their wedding invitation you can feel his heart stop beating. Come along for another great installment of the Jack Stratton series and be prepared to put everything else to the side while holding your breath and praying that Jack and Alice will make it to their wedding. This series just keeps getting better and better. A lot happens and to add it to my review would spoil it for the next reader, just know you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
