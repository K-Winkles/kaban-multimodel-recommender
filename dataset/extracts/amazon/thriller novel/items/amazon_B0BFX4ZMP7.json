                "reviewText": "James Rollins delivers a tour de force in his latest addition in his acclaimed Sigma Force series and this times an old foe shows up, determined to get revenge, the world is on the brink yet again and Sigma Force is forced to join forces with an enemy that will kill any of them if it comes to it. With new faces and some very familiar faces joining the hunt into history and more, Sigma Force is on deck with action from start to end in TIDES OF FIRE. With every book in this series James Rollins creates, he ramps up the action, mystery and more within the pages. TIDES OF FIRE is definitely an edge of your seat ride from start to finish and I can honestly see how nerve wracking this book was. Every time I pick up this author\u2019s books, I know I am in for a ride of my life as the reader is drawn into a historical mystery that threatens the modern/present day with a calamity of epic proportions. The twists alone had me gasping in disbelief and wonder as I kept flipping the pages as I read, eager to see what else this author maestro had in store for his readers.TIDES OF FIRE will keep the reader glued to the very end and I can attest that ending alone has me wondering just what is going to happen next for Sigma Force, Paint and the crew that helm it as this past enemy has them in its sight. This is a fast-paced story that delivered science in a way that I could understand, with mysteries of the deep sea as the center of it all. With each book, I feel this author just delivers more and more goodness to his readers because I don\u2019t know where he gets his ideas, but TIDES OF FIRE deliver a walloping of a wild ride that left me eager to see what is next for this group as a whole doesn\u2019t get old or stale. Each new book delivers something even more intriguing and entertaining to the series and to the main characters as a whole. I cant wait for the next Sigma book Arkangel to come out next year.",

                "reviewText": "Last year Rollins published <u>Kingdom of Bones</u> which I read and gave 4 stars to but a grudging 4 stars. I criticized the book for being exhausting and too much of a good thing. The actions scenes in the book were non-stop and over-the-top to the point of compromising the reader's ability to suspend belief properly due any work of fiction...up to a limit. Apparently Rollins didn't get the message or just differs in opinion on this issue because this book is no less exhausting than last year's addition to this series. Nevertheless I will still give it 4 stars as it is a page turner that will have the reader reading long passed their bedtime. Isn't that what a thriller is supposed to do? Of course the story will also tire the reader out which should result in a good night's sleep but after reading what happens in this book I doubt the reader will sleep well but for all the worry and wonder this book will cause. So what's the book about?To begin with the reader will be exposed to a lot of information on geology, biology, oceanography, deep sea exploration and the associated vehicles for that activity, as well as the history and culture of Western Pacific native peoples and I've probably forgotten about some of the other covered subjects. Let's just say there's a lot packed into this story so you will be learning as well as be entertained. Basically, the area in the Southwest Pacific in the Indonesia area becomes geologically unstable and its numerous volcanoes begin to erupt. The cause of the instability may have something to do with the Chinese who become very interested in what is happening for reasons known and unknown. A multi-billionaire and his enormous and fully equipped research vessel and its related components is in the area and pressed into service as are some of the Sigma Force who happen to be in Hong Kong for a birthday party and family gathering for Seichen and her mother. The story is non-stop excitement with catastrophe on top of catastrophe complicated by shoot-outs with mercenaries and Chinese military and did I mention the intelligent but deadly coral? It's a fun read but HEY JIM some of your readers (ME) are elderly. We like a good book but there is a limit to how much excitement we can handle in one sitting. Please dial the excitement level down before one of your books gives me a heart attack and my wife sues you. Ha, you laugh but she is will. LOL. Enjoy the book.",

Mit jedem Sigma-Roman wird die Welt aufs Neue gerettet, so dass wir alle ungest\u00f6rt seinem n\u00e4chsten Thriller entgegenfiebern k\u00f6nnen. Was er sich aber hier leistet, sprengt alle Grenzen. Im australisch-indonesischem Raum jagt ein Erdbeben das n\u00e4chste, ausserdem spielen die Korallen verr\u00fcckt. Menschen werden mit einem unbekannten Gift infiziert, das sie buchst\u00e4blich versteinern l\u00e4\u00dft. Gibt es einen Zusammenhang zwischen den beiden Ph\u00e4nomenen? Commander Grayson Pierce ist sich da absolut sicher. Die Antwort liegt f\u00fcr ihn in der pr\u00e4historischen und geologischen Geschichte der Region verborgen. Leider sind auch andere an den ungew\u00f6hnlichen Vorkommnissen interessiert-man k\u00f6nnte daraus ja eine Waffe basteln. Und ein alter Feind von Sigma mischt wieder an vorderster Front mit.Als dann auch noch Vulkane in Serie ausbrechen und die Zukunft ganz S\u00fcdostasiens und auch der Welt auf dem Spiel steht, muss Sigma aufs Ganze gehen und sich dorthin begeben, wo noch kein Mensch sich hintraute..Matthew Reilly und Clive Cussler standen bei der Entstehung dieses Thrillers sicherlich Pate. Leider ist der Grat zwischen Cliffhanger-Sequenzen, wissenschaftlichem Exkurs und l\u00e4cherlich wirkenden L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tzen streckenweise recht schmal. Das \u00fcberraschende Finale er\u00f6ffnet uns einen Ausblick auf die \"Mutter aller Sigma-Thriller\", die vom Autor am Ende des Buches angek\u00fcndigt wird. Da sind wir aber gespannt..drei Sterne w\u00e4ren hier ad\u00e4quat gewesen, da der Thriller jedoch keine Langeweile beim Lesen aufkommen l\u00e4\u00dft, gebe ich gerne einen Stern aus Vulkanasche dazu.",
