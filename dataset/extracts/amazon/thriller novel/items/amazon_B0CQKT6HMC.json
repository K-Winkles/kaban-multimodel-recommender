Miss Busby, an older, intelligent, kind - thoughtful lady hits the spot for this reader who relates to all those attributes. And, Adeline, the boisterous, blunt best friend is a wonderful foil for Miss Busby. Enid adds her own rich insights which prove older ladies retain their wits, add their experiences and should not be ignored.The authors write so well; unfortunately, that is too often not the case these days. And, they know their main characters intimately. I think they must enjoy older people in their own lives.The mystery might be solved by the reader before the climax, but that leaves fine points to be revealed. And, the added fleshing out and settling of lives leaves the reader feeling content and eager for the next story. This reader loves a happy ending.",

A Jewish man who wears a yarmelka would observe the Sabbath, not eat ham and would probably not go to church to seek solace from the Lord. It is not necessarily required like the above behaviors.
