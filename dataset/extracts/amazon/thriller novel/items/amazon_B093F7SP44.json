                "reviewText": "Grisham is a terrific novelist & writer. This particular book is slow going in the early chapters which I believe his editor should have pointed out to him.Only my opinion but all writers need a good editor & proof reader. I\u2019ve tried writing a novel, attempted self publishing only to be told that very thing. \u201cSon get an editor the publisher advised adding, \u201cYou use far too many words when fewer would be more effective.\u201dI\u2019m not delusional enough to think I\u2019m even close to being in Grisham\u2019s class. My point: If you have several years in any profession, incidents, crazy stories, events, even theories will surface to give one an idea for a story to refer to or build around. I think Grisham is a good example of my theory.This story is okay, slow going as alluded to earlier but worth a read from a brilliant writer.",

                "reviewText": "JUDGE\u2019S LIST by John GrishamWell, I was so happy to go back to one of the loves of my literary like, John Grisham, and see that he\u2019s back in shape. We parted a while ago when I read some of his work that was not worthy of Grisham. But I am glad we are back together..Judge\u2019s List is part of the Lacy Stolz series. Stolz works as an investigator for the Florida Board of Judicial Conduct. A strong woman in her thirties, she is faced with unexpected complications that seem to belong more to the FBI than to the BJC. The woman who insists on seeing her, Jeri, is convinced that a respected judge is also a serial killer, and that one of his victims was her own father. For twenty years, Jeri built an enormous dossier on that judge, stalked him and, in the process, created several identities with different names, and untraceable phone numbers.What\u2019s fascinating in this thriller comes from Grisham\u2019s parallel between two obsessive and organized minds, Jeri\u2019s and the judge/serial killer\u2019s. One good and one evil, they use similar methods to get to their end, one looking for justice, the other looking for the next revenge murder. While working as a novel with psychological insights and complex analysis, it can be read also as a fable representing the human mind and its duality and inner fight between negative and positive forces. There is a paragraph toward the end where Jeri admits that part of her got strangely attached to the man who killed her father. Her decades-long investigation has made him an intimate part of her life. And, discovering the magnitude of her work, the killer himself thinks of this enemy, as brilliant as he is, with reverence.If I only gave three stars to the novel, it\u2019s not because of the journalistic, minimalist prose characteristic of this author. Simplicity is not that simple. It\u2019s because I compare Grisham to Grisham \u2013a graving on a curve of sorts. I believe he has done better in the past. I am about to read one of his old books, and should I change my mind after that, I will add a star here. The other reason is the cute, sentimental ending. This ain\u2019t a cute story and, should the reader need a release from this dark tale, Grisham could have placed it in an epilogue and not as the last chapter.It's definitely worth a read. Despite his nearly telegraphic style, or because of it and its efficiency, Grisham manages to go to the depths and conflicts of our human condition.6.5.23",
