                "reviewText": "Wow. Just wow.I feel like I can\u2019t say it enough, but I thoroughly enjoyed Horrorst\u00f6r and highly recommend it. I think the audiences that would get the most of this book would obviously be fans of horror and darker comedy, but also those who have had to work in the soul-sucking world of mainstream retail.I still shudder when I think about my experiences working in retail. Ugh.The world that Hendrix builds in this novel accurately depicts the real-life hell that working in retail usually is. From the absolutely atrocious customers to the sense that loyalty means taking one for the team (only for the good of the company), to the disconnect between corporate ideals and the reality of the sales floor\u2026you\u2019ll have disturbing flashbacks of your worst retail employee experiences. I especially liked how each of the characters felt real and entirely plausible, and could easily compare each one to a past or present coworker of my own.However, what I enjoyed most about this book was its design - which was not only insanely smart but works really well to create an immersive reading experience rather than just be exist as an attractive piece of cover art. Upon first glance, I mistook this book for an actual furniture catalog! Taking a closer look, I began to notice dark oddities - clawing hands, trapped faces, rats, ominous scratches, etc. The design continues within the cover pages, further resembling a furniture catalog with a detailed store map, index, ads, and even an Orsk order form! You can literally map out the characters\u2019 journeys through the Orsk showroom and the Beehive as you read the story.My favorite design element can be found at the beginning of every chapter. Each chapter starts with what appears to be your standard furniture ad for a variety of Swedish themed furniture pieces. Upon closer inspection, the captions reveal the darker nature of each featured piece. As the story continues, the ads become increasingly dark as they\u2019re reinvented into torture devices that foreshadow the fates of the characters. See a spoiler-free example below:\u201cBoasting several advantages over traditional forms of restraint, BODAVEST confines the penitent and opposes the agitated movement of blood toward the brain, forcing the subject into a state of total immobility, conducive to self-reflection and free of stressful outside stimuli.\u201dYeah, not quite what you\u2019ll find in your average Ikea catalog.Even though this was a quick and fun read, it was as creepy as it was entertaining. Not only did the story progress at an appropriate pace, but the building tension and gross imagery had me truly immersed in the Orsk showroom. In fact, this was the first book I\u2019ve ever read that physically disturbed me (refer to the H\u00fcgga and Bodavest chapters for some skin-crawling horror scenes). I had to frequently put this book down to take breaks after some of the more gory scenes.Lesson learned: don\u2019t mix shrink wrap with an office chair\u2026Overall, I loved this fun horror read because of how imaginative, witty, and captivating it was. Rumor has it, a film adaptation may be in the works!",

                "reviewText": "I love a classic haunted house as much as anyone. There\u2019s something wonderful about an old abandoned house (or mansion or castle or hotel or insane asylum), dilapidated, decaying, overgrown, crumbling, filled with creaking doors, dark shadows, creepy dolls, and something sinister that whispers from the attic.But there\u2019s also a place in my heart for a modern, clean, brightly-lit building that\u2019s nevertheless crawling with the unquiet spirits of the dead. The suburban home built over an Indian graveyard, the supermarket with bloody handprints appearing mysteriously on the freezer cases, the trendy nightclub plagued by unusual deaths and fashionable vampires. Horror writers love this stuff, too \u2014 you can find horror wrapped around modern suburban and retail settings in films like \u201cPoltergeist\u201d and \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (and many other early-outbreak zombie movies) and in books and stories like Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Mist,\u201d Anne Rivers Siddons\u2019 \u201cThe House Next Door,\u201d and Mark Z. Danielewski\u2019s \u201cHouse of Leaves.\u201dAnd there\u2019s also this book, \u201cHorrorst\u00f6r,\u201d a short horror novel (with strong humor elements) written by Grady Hendrix. Its focus is on a haunting at an IKEA-style big box retail store.The lead character in the story is Amy, a slacker in a thoroughly dead-end job working retail at ORSK, a furniture and housewares store designed from the ground up to look and feel like an IKEA store. It has the same winding pathway through the store, the same \u201cMagic Tool\u201d required to put every piece of furniture together, the same style of faux-Scandinavian names for all the products. Amy wants to transfer back to the ORSK store she used to work at, mainly because she thinks she\u2019s about to get fired by Basil, an assistant manager and gung-ho ORSK fanboy. But as it turns out, Basil actually wants to ask Amy and another co-worker, Ruth Anne, an older long-term employee who lives for her job, loves stuffed animals, and is adored by everyone on the staff, to take on a special duty \u2014 patrolling the store at night.You see, the store has been suffering unusual vandalism. Some of the glassware has been broken, furniture has been soiled, and there are odd smells in the building. Basil wants Amy and Ruth Anne to join him on a secret late-night patrol, after everyone has gone home, to see if anyone is breaking into the building. They soon find some interesting problems. There are rats in the kitchen showcases, even though there\u2019s no food there and no water hookups. Everyone keeps getting lost, which might make sense if they were just customers and not employees trained to find their way around the store quickly. And the mysterious grafitti messages in the restrooms referring ominously to \u201cthe Beehive\u201d are multiplying rapidly.And they do find some unexpected interlopers. Matt and Trinity are a couple of fellow co-workers at ORSK who have sneaked into the store because they thinks there are ghosts in the building and want to make a reality-TV ghost hunter show. And there\u2019s also a homeless man, Carl, who has been secretly living in the store for a few weeks.Trinity has an idea. She still thinks there are ghosts in the building, and what\u2019s the best way to contact ghosts? Let\u2019s everyone hold a seance!And then everything goes straight to hell.Can Amy and her coworkers survive the night shift at ORSK? Can they escape the store? Or are they doomed to toil forever in the stone walls and iron restraints of the Beehive?I really enjoyed this book. I burned my way through it as quickly as I could, and a couple nights, where I made the mistake of reading it too close to bedtime, it actually kept me up late. I did think that the very best parts of the novel were fairly early on, when the scares were subtle and more creepy than heart-stopping. The seasoned employees getting lost in their own store? That was weirdly realistic \u2014 you could imagine it happening, but you could also see why it would be really unnerving. The odd sounds after the store closes, combined with the sudden unfamiliarity of the environment of the store was also spooky \u2014 and definitely familiar for anyone who\u2019s ever had to work late in their office, where darkness and emptiness make the comfortable surroundings feel strange and dangerous.Even better than that was the graffiti in the restroom. The dozens of scrawled names and scratched-out years, all referencing the mysterious Beehive, feel intensely eerie, a perfect element to place in a modern retail ghost story. There are also some very effective moments when the employees discover that the purely decorative doors in the showcases now open into dank, cavernous hallways leading deep into the earth.And the seance may have been a monumentally stupid move on the part of the characters, but the way they did it was an original and wonderful thing to have in a horror novel. It\u2019s simultaneously terrifying \u2014 because you know what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 and hilarious \u2014 because you know what\u2019s going to happen.Once the Big Bad makes his appearance, and especially when he captures Amy for the first time, the story starts moving away from being a ghost story and edging more into torture porn. The story shows some serious cracks in this section, in part because it\u2019s too long \u2014 I just don\u2019t enjoy reading multiple pages about someone being strapped into a torture chair that tightens to the point where she loses sensation in her limbs and can barely draw a breath. (This may also indicate that I have never enjoyed torture porn.) But it\u2019s also a bit too short \u2014 we\u2019re told that Amy\u2019s mind breaks almost entirely not long after she\u2019s strapped in, to the point where Stockholm Syndrome sets in and she starts worshiping her captor. And then, when she\u2019s released from confinement, it\u2019s not too many more pages before her mind has completely recovered to its previously healthy state \u2014 and even improved, as she\u2019s much braver and more resourceful for the rest of the novel.One of the real selling points of this novel is the fantastic graphic design by Andie Reid and illustrations by Michael Rogalski. The book cover looks like one of the big, glossy IKEA design catalogs \u2014 with a few subtle and not-so-subtle differences to give some visual cues to the horrors within \u2014 and each chapter opens with a page from the fictional ORSK catalog spotlighting one of their products, complete with IKEA-style art, a faux-Scandinavian name, and upbeat flavor text. But after the supernatural terrors start climbing out of the woodwork after the seance, all the featured furniture gets replaced with medieval torture devices. It makes the story a lot more fun and a lot funnier, while still giving a nice dose of the chills to readers.",

                "reviewText": "Inicialmente, Horrorstor parece uma mistura da divertida s\u00e9rie \"Superstore\" com uma narrativa sobre lugares mal-assombrados. N\u00e3o deixa de ser, de certa forma, mas \u00e9 bem mais que isso; o tom mais leve da narrativa vai progressivamente sendo \"contaminado\" pela escurid\u00e3o que habita o lugar e os horrores que descreve - sempre envoltos em trevas - s\u00e3o realmente perturbadores.Mais al\u00e9m, o romance ganha for\u00e7a ao comparar essa loja - a Orsk, uma esp\u00e9cie de Ikea, ou Etna, Leroy Merlin etc. - \u00e0 pris\u00e3o pan\u00f3ptica que havia naquele mesmo lugar, s\u00e9culos antes: o trabalho repetitivo, sempre sob supervis\u00e3o, an\u00e1logo \u00e0 escravid\u00e3o, apagando individualidades, sobre diferentes pretextos - no caso da pris\u00e3o, os \"penitentes\" precisavam ser curados de seus pecados; no caso da loja, os funcion\u00e1rios se submetiam \u00e0 m\u00e1quina capitalista pois precisavam sobreviver. E mal conseguiam, como no caso da protagonista (que curiosamente (?) se chama Amy, mesmo nome da protagonista de Superstore), sempre individada.Esse foi meu terceiro livro do Hendrix (gostei dos 3) e cada vez mais creio que ele - que por alguma raz\u00e3o ainda n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o reconhecido (talvez ap\u00f3s um de seus romances ser inevitavelmente adaptado, isso mude) - \u00e9 um dos grandes nomes da literatura de terror contempor\u00e2nea.",
