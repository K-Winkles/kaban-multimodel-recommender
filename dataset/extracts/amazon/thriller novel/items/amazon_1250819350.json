If I could give it more than 5 \u2b50\ufe0f I would.I started this book with trepidation hoping it wasn\u2019t TOO much of a thriller mystery. But with Stephen King saying he loved it \ud83d\ude0d you can\u2019t quite be sure what you\u2019re getting into!I have to say I wished I could\u2019ve just read the whole thing at once. I didn\u2019t want to put it down!The author does an amazing job of stringing you along with bits and pieces. He keeps the suspense going till the very end.It\u2019s not often I read \u2018suspense, thriller\u2019 type books anymore because sometimes they\u2019re just too realistic. When I was younger and didn\u2019t know the woes of the world I love suspense, thriller, horror. So thank you for making the book not quite too dark!This is a must read! Thank you Kindle for pushing your readers into a few things with the reader achievements. This was a Goodreads Beat of the year book. Yes I realize you don\u2019t have to get that achievement, but hey I like it!So one more time READ THIS BOOK.",

All in all a great thriller from Jason. :)_________ Spoilers ___________I knew right away when she mentioned she was christian there would be some kind of demon/possesed aspects, that trope is pretty obvious. Also one of the reasons I cant give this a full 5 stars is because Teddy did not feel like a 5 year old, his language was way too grown up. Another aspect is that it feels icky to me to mention both J.K rowling and trans into one book. I dont think thats a great combo. But I will deifntly read something from Jason again.",

                "reviewText": "This is not just an entertaining read, it's quite original. Although the story contains many tropes of ghost stories, thrillers, etc it easily steps far beyond the box. The areas of story that often drag in other novels move along well, and keep the flow of the story moving forward. It is rare that I don't have a clue a twist is coming, but Mr. Rekulak succeeded employing a very unexpected twist. Hidden Pictures is entertaining., and well paced. The characters are well developed, the scenes are easy to imagine and work well with the story. A suspenseful read that does not forget the bones of a story.",

I connected with this quite a bit since I have 2 young boys so I could put myself in this situation and it seriously gave me the creeps. The ending \u201ctwist\u201d caught me by surprise for sure and I was shocked, then I ended up crying at the end. What a rollercoaster, I loved this and how the pictures are used throughout the book to really drive the point home!I ended up falling in love with the child in this book, such a sweet kid with a great imagination and really rooting for the FMC, despite her flaws and past issues. The story line has been done a ton in horror movies and books but had a great twist here that made it stand out and not feel redundant. The ending really felt realistic and was a great finish to the story. I am not always a thriller person as I feel they are usually predictable and all so similar but this one bordered more on the horror side and I think that\u2019s why I liked it so much.",

Shorty after getting the job the boy who she's caring for, Teddy, starts drawing very concerning pictures and Mallory is concerned. She's convinced these drawings are clues to the unsolved murder that happened in her cabin in the early 1900s. She would never have imagined the truth she would uncover.I really enjoyed reading the book. I found Mallory's backstory quite intriguing and was curious to learn more about it. The unsolved murder in her cabin was also a fascinating mystery that captivated me throughout the book. The twist at the end caught me off guard and was quite mind-blowing. Although the ending left me feeling sad and empty, it was a realistic conclusion, even though I was hoping for a happy ending. I do wish there was more closure in the ending, such as finding out who finished 3rd in the race.",

However, Hidden Pictures kept me flipping through the pages wanting to know what will happen next. It was an incredible read and didn't take long to finish because I kept sitting down with the book. The ending surprised me, I wasn't expecting it but the ending had me on the edge until it ended, I had to finish the last bit without stopping.I definitely recommend this book if you love thrillers with a little bit of supernatural in it. I found it via Tiktok and was glad I looked more into it. I'll have to take a look at more of this author's work.",

When I saw how many 5 star reviews it had I knew it must be special. It is so cleverly written that I found myself thinking, \u201cjust one more chapter and I\u2019m going to bed\u201d. I finally laid down at 5 am. The uniqueness of the story made it so enticing. What makes it flow with the suspense in the background like music in a movie is exceptional. It doesn\u2019t have to knock you over the head with violence and gore. It has a life of its own. I love that it\u2019s not obvious. You really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening until it does. Anyone who reads this genre will totally enjoy this book.",

They know that she is in recovery, but they give her a chance. She ends up doing wonderful with Teddy and is in charge of helping him get ready to start school soon. But soon Teddy starts to draw some strange and disturbing pictures. Mallory gets caught up in trying to find out what the pictures mean, and she feels that the cottage she\u2019s staying in, is haunted. Such a great read!!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok, primeiramente a entrega foi espetacular! Chegou em uns 3/4 dias se n\u00e3o me engano, novinho, super bem embalado e como podem ver no v\u00eddeo e nas fotos \u00e9 em ingl\u00eas mesmo.Agora vamos para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o liter\u00e1ria. Bem, na vdd eu li o e-book ano passado quando tinha lan\u00e7ado (eu li em junho e lan\u00e7ou em maio) e n\u00e3o tinha nenhuma ideia do que esperar. Geralmente n\u00e3o curto bastante o g\u00eanero suspense mas tava na pilha do Stranger Things que teria uma nova temporada e decidi dar uma chance pro autor que nunca tinha nem ouvido ningu\u00e9m comentar antes. Gente\u2026 foi amor \u00e0 primeira lida kkkk al\u00e9m de ser uma hist\u00f3ria ao mesmo tempo gostosa, com um ar de \u201cver\u00e3o suburbano estadunidense\u201d tamb\u00e9m vai pegando embalo e criando aquele suspense ao passar dos cap\u00edtulos que me deixou perdida nas p\u00e1ginas por horas! A personagem principal \u00e9 bem escrita em minha opini\u00e3o. O Rekulak conseguiu deixar ela bem humana, sem aqueles clich\u00eas horrorosos que deixam mulheres escritas por homens t\u00e3o 2-dimensionais. A fam\u00edlia \u00e9 bastante interessante e as intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os personagens \u00e9 perfeito pra quem gosta de psicanalisar relacionamentos interpessoais. E o reviravolta do final!! Perfeito de toda forma!Enfim acho que deu pra entender que eu sou f\u00e3 desse livro.Podem comprar sem medo e ali\u00e1s n\u00e3o me surpreenderia se essa hist\u00f3ria virasse filme logo logo.",
