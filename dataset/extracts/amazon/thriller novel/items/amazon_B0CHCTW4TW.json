Two female victims in quick succession, the same brutal MO, and every indication that victim number three is only days away. Also in the killer\u2019s scope is Constant herself. When she interviews a local family who may be potential witnesses, she leads the devil to their doorstep, throwing their lives into chaos. Constant will do anything to protect them, but it won\u2019t be easy. Because nothing in Clark Valley is quite what it seems.",

                "reviewText": "Unlike many very prolific & successful authors, the quality of Deaver\u2019s writing never declines! Whether it\u2019s a short story, novella or full-length novel, you are still treated to a fast paced, intricate plot with multiple fascinating characters that still keep you on the edge of your seat! Ordinarily, I\u2019m not a huge fan of short stories or novellas, but I make an exception for Deaver\u2019s works because I don\u2019t have to sacrifice quality. The main character in this novella made a previous appearance in either a short story or another novella. Because she\u2019s such a complex character, I was happy to see her fill the central role in this novella.If you\u2019re new to Deaver and are looking for a good entry point, I highly recommend reading this novella! You\u2019ll get a feel for his writing style, plot pacing & character development so you can decide if you\u2019re interesting in reading more of Deaver\u2019s work.",

                "reviewText": "It's nice to have a few familiar authors this month, and seeing a Jeffrey Deaver story made the First Reads choice easy. Deaver has a talent for surprise twists in a short story format and I always enjoy his stories.\"The Rule of Threes\" is described as a Novella, and while not as long as a full-length book, it's still substantial enough to make it a worth-while First Reads selection. Just keep in mind that Amazon often adds Deaver short stories to their \"Prime Reading\" selection to borrow for free so if another book catches your eye this month there is a good chance you will have an opportunity to read this one as well for free at a later time.The first surprise twist comes later on in this story, but once it does, the twists and turns come as often as one has come to expect with this author. Perhaps a little more predictable than usual but they are there, along with a cast of nasty characters. We also see a return of tough, take-law-in-her-own-hands Agent Constant Marlowe from the Broken Doll series of short stories.Some language but not excessive enough to be distracting. Rape, murder, hate crimes etc are main themes but while present, are not described in gory detail.A quick, enjoyable read for this rainy day spent at home.",

Fascinating characters \u2013 both good and bad, and an unfamiliar setting brought to life by the skills of the writer. The Novella length was just right.

                "reviewText": "I am not sure that this is a 'novella' at 261 pages but it is certainly shorter than most of Deaver's novels. An excellent story with good characters and a very twisty plot. I gasped out loud at one point! I very much liked Constant Marlowe and it seems that she has appeared in other books. It looks like my TBR will be growing again. Definitely recommend this for lovers of police procedurals with a good twisty plot.",
