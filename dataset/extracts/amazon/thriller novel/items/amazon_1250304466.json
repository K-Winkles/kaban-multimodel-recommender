I knew I needed a detective, but I didn\u2019t know anything about detectives. So I thought how well I know psychotherapists and psychiatric units, and decided to make my detective into a psychotherapist. Likewise, in The Maidens, Mariana is a group therapist, as I know a fair bit about group therapy.",

The characters are strong and well written, the setting is atmospheric and reflects the plotline wonderfully. Slow burn is a plus in this book, and the pace it builds up is wonderful. So many times I thought I'd figured it out, only to have a plot twist appear and leave me wondering.There are characters in the book that will make you go \"Oh\", if you've read The Silent Patient, but it is in no way required reading to enjoy this one. A second great offering from this Author, and it makes me want to buy his next book. Enjoy!!",

                "reviewText": "3.5\u2728I was excited when I started reading this book ~ psych thriller combined with Greek tragedies? Heck, yeah!..and while I do appreciate the slow-paced story, the red herrings thrown left and right and the 'straight from the murderer's journal' account in some chapters, the whole story just somewhat, disappoints in the 'mess my head up' category I usually enjoy in psych thrillers. I really did expect to have at least one of the red herrings be an actual 'sensible' clue to give a more appropriate background to why the killer was the killer (and not anybody else). Y'know? the right under your nose burried under a lot of red herring type of clue that all makes sense (or not) at the end.Yet, it just ends with a large heap of red herrings turned to plot holes. Like when it was made to believe that the loss of Seb was focal to the narrative of the MC and yet when the killer was revealed, t'was just, the heck happened? He just died like that? He didn't even faked his death? It was just like that and he's now filed in the 'good riddance' category?Imagine being thrown with clues left and right, only to have the story reveal that the killer was somewhat a proxy murderer ~ continuing the plan of the would be original killer as a retaliation and a mark of the beginnings of an inevitable psychological disintegration brought about by the loss of the predatory influence to which the proxy was subjected to.It is a nice book for a beginner whodunit mystery. A bit disappointing if you're really after the psychological aspect of the psych thriller category. Kinda felt that all the references to 'daddy issues', abuse, and even the innuendo of the original culprit having DID had been lost in the narrative.",

They all are plausible and therefore you don\u2019t feel cheated when the book has ended. All of them have a twist at the end that really adds to the excitement of the book.

                "reviewText": "Thanks to Celadon for the advanced readers copy!THE MAIDENS is/was one of my most anticipated reads (The Silent Patient is def in my top 5 books. EVER.) In terms of allusions to mythology, references to Tennyson and the Cambridge feel, this book knocked it out of the park.In terms of having a big reveal or shocking twist- it was kinda a let down.This one is definitely a slow burn. Not a boring one per se, but this where you feel comfortable and not at all guilty for using a book mark (book marks ARE NOT for quitters, haterz). The pacing isn't heart pounding, but it is suspenseful.The setting of Oxford/Cambridge is one of my favorites! I am also obsessed with the TV shows Endeavor/Morse/Lewis and this book put me right into that unique and quintessential English setting. Visiting Oxbridge (okay, I know I used that wrong) is definitely on my bucket list.Give me a good serial killer story and I'm hooked. The wannabe forensic psychoanalytic in me <i>loves</i> reading about gruesome motives etc. THE MAIDENS goes above and beyond with that for me. Another reason why I loved THE SILENT PATIENT so much, was that it was also super psychological.Right away, we are thrown into the conflict of the story. We aren't waiting for chapters for something to happen, if I remember correctly, the call from Zoey comes in chapter 2 or 3? The backstory's of each character is slowly revealed throughout the book.Speaking of characters, we have come to probably the most important part: the characters.Marina- girl, why in the world did you pray to the goddess of the underworld? Is there something I'm missing? I mean what did you expect?!Professor Fosca- for someone who claims their innocence so profoundly, you sure do seem suspicious.Ruth- when I read the chapter she was in I kept thinking 'wasn't there a Ruth character in TSP?' I'll let you work out the rest.In conclusion, THE MAIDENS is a dark and conceptual tale rooted in Greek mythology. It's a fascinating tale of obsession, love and powerful influence.mash ups: The Secret History, The Silent Patient and Endeavor.",

One thing I noticed is that some things didn't finish right. Some things were left unexplained. With The Silent Patient, it was more defined and every detail was explained. Regardless, I can't wait for Alex Michaelides to create more titles!!",
