                "reviewText": "The story was very good, a little slow at times but definitely for the most part suspenseful, especially toward the end. However I'm not a big fan of the British English. The lingo is different and it takes a few references and context to understand what certain situations are about. The author uses words like cross and row which seems to reference a conflict or disagreement. Or takeaway, lie in, A-levels so it's a bit distracting to understandthe references. Overall though the storyline was very good.",

                "reviewText": "There are elements that are very good in Teresa Driscoll\u2019s book, \u201cI Am Watching You.\u201d At the same time, there are other aspects of the book that were bothersome.The book is composed of short chapters, with a number of characters relating the story. The main character is Ella, identified in her titled chapters as The Witness. Ella was on a train ride and thus became one of the last people to see Anna before she disappeared. She was also able to describe the two young men who had approached Anna and her friend, Sarah. Anna\u2019s disappearance and probable murder haunts Ella throughout the book, as she blames herself for not doing anything to protect the young girls, who are both 16 years old.Other characters are introduced, and some are painted as the potential guilty party. Ms. Driscoll makes the guesswork murky as many of the characters have secrets that may or may not be connected with Anna. The overall plot is good, and the author continues to keep us questioning who might have been involved right up to the book\u2019s end.What bothered me about the book was the writing style and some plot specifics. Ms. Driscoll has a habit of using partial sentences, and while these can be effective, they lose their power when used excessively. At first, because the story started off with Ella relating everything in first person, I believed it to be more of a stream-of-consciousness thought process. However, when the author moved to subsequent chapters (everything else in third person), the phrases and partial sentences continued. While it would have worked for Ella to tell her story in that manner, having every character think the same way seemed to blur the characterizations. The other stylistic device used over and over was the introduction of a secret at the end of almost every chapter. Again, this can be a powerful tool, but when used constantly, the story becomes more bothersome than exciting.Most of the story is told a year later, and the investigation into Anna\u2019s disappearance is still being worked on by the police. When the guilty person is finally revealed, it was difficult to believe that the police would have neglected to perform a full investigation (the author tells us at the end that police only did a \u201ccursory\u201d investigation on the person). I hesitate to say more as it would potentially become a spoiler, but for me, this became a fatal flaw and made the ending feel forced.Coupled with the writing issues described a few paragraphs ago, I ended up with mixed feelings the book. I thought this could have been a great story, and there were elements \u2013 characters, a good plot idea, a number of misleading side stories, good dialogue \u2013 that might have added up to a fantastic read. Unfortunately, the writing style and the inefficient police investigation brought this down to a better-than-average tale. Three-and-a-half stars.",

The myriad of characters are true to life and reminded me of people, thoughts and experiences in my journey though life. Especially seeing something that does not sit well with you and plays on your conscience. To say something of not?",

We always are suspicious of everyone who seems too close & swear they did it. (Everyone is sus nowadays lol) We assume, but it's always who we least expect. \ud83d\ude31\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f4/5\ud83c\udf6d\ud83c\udf6dOctober bookclub pick. \ud83c\udf6d\ud83c\udf6dGathering my thoughts here..... I did not see that ending coming. It wasn't too rushed & a nice build-up even though I got a little bored with the flower science lessons. I love a book that has different POVs that tell the story going forward & not a repetition of the same scene with the POVs. Also appreciated the chapters are numbered & provide the POV name. This is very helpful in our bookclub when we make references during our meetings.Favorite characters: Sammy the dog & Caroline.Favorite moment: Caroline suggests the name Dawn. \"Because you don't like yourself very much....You need a fresh start, lovely......You need the sun to come up.\" \ud83e\udd7a@tkdriscoll_author really stumped me here & I don't get stumped often! \ud83d\ude05I haven't seen this on #bookstagram.
