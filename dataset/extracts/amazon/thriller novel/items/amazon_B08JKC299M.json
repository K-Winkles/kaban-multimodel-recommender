JEAN HANFF KORELITZ: Like most writers I\u2019m fascinated by plagiarism and the murkiness around creative appropriation: chefs stealing recipes from other chefs, comedians helping themselves to other comedians\u2019 jokes, academic theft, and above all creative writers appropriating work by others. I\u2019m hardly the first novelist to write about this \u2014 there\u2019s an entire sub-genre of Stephen King work on this theme \u2014 and it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve touched on it in my own work, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve placed it front and center in a book. I think it makes sense to write about the things that fascinate us.",

Do you think you\u2019d ever steal a genius idea for a book if you knew it would never be used? I wouldn\u2019t, but only because I\u2019m squeamish by nature and I\u2019d be terrified about that degree of exposure and disapproval. But like most artists, I also understand that stories run underneath the ground of our collective experience, and we all dip into them, whether we\u2019re aware of it or not. The real question is: At what point does a collective story become the individual property of a person or an artist? A contender for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Drama was The Inheritance by Matthew Lopez, which openly adapts Forster\u2019s Howards End to contemporary New York City. This is a normal, even laudatory practice, which artists fully understand. But to help yourself to the specific plot of a recently deceased author who never completed his book? I don\u2019t know where the line is, exactly, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s over it.",

                "reviewText": "Hanff Korelitz created a main character that I initially loathed, then later liked, despite his flaws, and then even eventually rooted for in the end. Not an easy task, so kudos on that front. Jake is a novelist who experienced early modest acclaim, but he hasn\u2019t been able to replicate that success in his subsequent efforts. He longs for the dreamed-of accolades of a truly famous writer, but instead teaches creative writing at a small, obscure MFA program in Vermont. He\u2019s envious of his student\u2019s youth and potential talent, and also disdainful of what he views as their na\u00efvet\u00e9 and inferiority. Then, he meets his new student, Evan Parker, who has obvious confidence in himself and his work. Jake automatically assumes Evan is without merit or skill and is stunned when Evan reluctantly shares his story ideas with him, begrudgingly agreeing that he can indeed write and has a viable, potential blockbuster plot on his hands. Jake is morose, competitive and churlishly waiting for Evan\u2019s mega-hit to reach publication, but nothing happens. Jake is understandably curious, and assumes that the dazzling idea just never made it to completion. He\u2019s mollified and appeased. Years pass. Jake gets curious again and searches for Evan and his book online. He finds nothing, but instead, stumbles on Evan\u2019s obituary. Jake is shocked. He mulls over the thought of a fresh idea languishing unused with the now-deceased Evan. Jake decides to take the original idea and craft it into a novel of his own. Staggering success comes to him as a result. He basks in the glory that he has always wanted, but is vaguely uneasy, fearful that someone will nullify his success if they discover where the initial book idea originated. Jake pushes down his reservations and misgivings, enjoying book tours and radio and television appearances. During one such appearance on a popular radio show, he meets, Anna, a smitten fan. They have a whirlwind courtship and marriage, and she moves to NY from WA to begin their life together. Jake can\u2019t believe his good fortune and they settle in happily. Anna improves his life, his diet, his apartment and his relationships. Then, suddenly out of nowhere, Jake begins receiving online messages from a stranger, who claims to know that Jake stole and plagiarized his stratospheric novel. He threatens exposure, and the threats escalate rapidly. Jake is in turmoil and sets out on a long journey to determine who his tormentor is. The book was slow to start, but the suspense ratchets up, once the story gains momentum. The book is well-written and carefully-plotted, with an intricate, disturbing and unsettling story. Somewhat implausible that a stranger (Jake) on a quest, with a shoestring of attachment to Evan, could garner so much information from townspeople in various states, who would more likely be suspicious and reticent of an outsider. I guessed the perpetrator/antagonist early on, but wondered if the author intended that, and wanted the reader to know, and only for Jake to be unaware. I disliked the ending, and thought it might veer in another direction. I hoped for feline intervention!This is a well-paced, dark thriller, with a glimpse into the world of publishing, exploring the complex motives and ambitions of authors seeking notoriety and all that entails. A good read.",

                "reviewText": "I was interested in this book because Jimmy Fallon mentioned it on The Tonight Show, when he was doing 'Summer Reads' My top two choices were this and Razorblade Tears. I'm Happy 'The Plot' won, because I was definitely intrigued by the story. In a way, it reminded me of a mix between I Know What you Did Last Summer and a Stephen King story called Secret Window, Secret Garden. This is not horror, but it's a mystery/thriller. This was the first book I read by Jean Hanff Korelitz, and I'm happy I did. I finished the book in about 4 days. I thought it started out a little slow, but when I got to chapter 7, it definitely started to pick up.Our main protagonist is a has-been author named Jacob 'Jake' Finch Bonner. Jake has written two books, but nobody really knows about his work. He becomes a writing teacher at Ripley college and one of his students is named Evan Parker. Parker is a narcisstic and full of himself. He looks down on everyone, including Jake. Jake wants his students to share their stories and ideas with each other, but Evan refuses, thinking he's writing the greatest book of all time. A book that everyone will read and a famous director will turn it into a movie someday.One day, Evan shares a few pages with Jake. The story is about a teenaged girl who lives in a large house and wants desperately to escape her mom. Jake is intrigued by the story, but goes on to try and do better things. Over the next two years, Jake is really struggling to find work, and eventually looks up to see if Evan ever published his 'great' novel. Turns out, Evan Parker died by an overdose, so Jake, desperate to make ends meet, decides to steal aspects of Evan's story for himself.Three years later, Jake has finally written a successful novel titled 'Crib' He's going on book tours, making television and radio appearances and even meets the love of his life named Anna. His book is so successful, that Steven Spielberg is turning it into a movie. Life is going great for Jake Bonner, until one day, he receives an e-mail from someone named Talented Tom that says \"You are a thief\"Jake begins to play detective and tries to figure out who Talented Tom is, why they're sending e-mails, and Evan's family history. The e-mails keep coming and even harassment on all social media. Clearly, someone doesn't want this story to be told, but why?Overall, I'm really glad I read this book. I was very intrigued by it, and it has a pretty cool twist. Hopefully someday, they'll turn it into a movie or tv series. I highly recommend THE PLOT!!!",

Mesmo antevendo o segredo que \u00e9 revelado no final, a autora consegue manter o interesse na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o do protagonista, mesmo ele n\u00e3o sendo um personagem carism\u00e1tico. J\u00e1 a hist\u00f3ria dentro da hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o empolga tanto e nem convence se tratar de um enredo surpreendente capaz de torna a hist\u00f3ria um best-seller internacional.Relevando-se estes detalhes, o livro \u00e9 muito bem escrito e para quem gosta do g\u00eanero, \u00e9 uma leitura recomendada.",

                "reviewText": "Writers writing about writers is not exactly an automatic \u201cgo-to\u201d for fiction lovers. I am not even sure it merits being considered as a subgenre on its own. Or maybe I haven\u2019t come across many that attracted me to read them. I picked up \u201cThe Plot\u201d because it made a top 2021 fiction list I saw, probably the result of great marketing by a strong publishing house, of the sort one will find in this novel. This is a novel to be enjoyed as a thriller that steadily builds suspense in an almost deceptive way, until you realise you cannot stop thinking about it and have to continue reading. On a lighter note, it also portrays the inner workings of the editorial and publishing world, and, finally, it takes a few stabs at a writer\u2019s ethical dilemmas regarding authorship and appropriation. All in all, a very entertaining read as we wrap up another year.",

I knew relatively early who did what.Disappointing.",
