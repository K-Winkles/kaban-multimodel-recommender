                "reviewText": "This is a review of Lisa Jewell's WATCHING YOU: A Novel. I found this book hard to put down. As with all this author\u2019s books, they always grab me from the start. This book was no exception.This story starts with a murder and evidence found. It introduces Joey Mullen and her husband Alfie Butter, in the beginning as major characters in the book. They are moving into her brother\u2019s home, to live temporarily with him, Jack Mullen, a heart surgeon at Bristol General Hospital and his wife, Rebecca. Their lives soon intertwine with neighbors in the posh Bristol community of Melville Heights, a row of 27 Victorian villas, which were all painted bright colors. Jack and Rebecca live in the cobalt blue house #14. Joey was so moved and excited to take Jack up on his offer of moving into their attic room and helping Rebecca with the baby. Rebecca is several months pregnant. Joey had always admired the homes that graced Melville Heights. As a young girl they were a sign that she was close to home. She fantasized about living up there and now found herself doing just that in the cobalt blue house.As the story goes on, it introduces you to several of the neighbors who are key to this mystery of subterfuge among the locality of Melville. A headmaster of their local state school, Tom Fitzwilliam, an elder, nice looking, gentleman and his family, wife Nicola, with their son, Freddie. They live in the canary yellow villa, two doors down from the Mullens. Another neighbor in the vicinity, who lived in the village, with her daughter Jenna was Frances, a small blonde middle aged woman who is obsessed with fear that she is a target of stalkers. Tom Fitzwilliam being one of them.As the story goes on we are drawn into the drama of these neighbors, each dealing with issues of their own, until towards the end, when they all come together tied up in a neat little bow. This novel keeps you guessing until its conclusion about who is the victim and who is the murderer.Simply a joy to read. Kept me up quite late last night, trying to finish it. I gave this book a rating of 5 out of 5 stars because I thoroughly had a good time reading it. Examine it and determine if you concur with the same conclusion.",

                "reviewText": "This book was told from many different points of view. Its mainly told in present tense by these people though it is all in the past and the actual present is a police inquiry into a death, A death that is attached to each person. About half way through it was obvious to me who the killer would be and I was right. That's ok though because the way the book wraps up had all of the loose ends of each persons story come to fruition. One thing about this book is that it really makes you realize the consequences of jumping to conclusions. You see characters come to conclusions as they look in from the outside but then find out it was something totally different from the inside. Ie. You never know what happens behind closed doors! The letter from the killer at the end was so terribly tragic and sad; it really makes one think about how ones actions can affect someone and how it can have a ripple effect (in this case, one that rippled back to its origins). So while it did take me a while to really get into the book, I ended it having loved it.",
