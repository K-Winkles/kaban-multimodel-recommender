        "description": "\"Chevy Stevens is a brilliant and unique talent and Dark Roads is an instant classic. My hat\u2019s off to her.\" (C. J. Box, number one New York Times best-selling author of Long Range)The Cold Creek Highway stretches close to five hundred miles through British Columbia\u2019s rugged wilderness to the west coast. Isolated and vast, it has become a prime hunting ground for predators. For decades, young women traveling the road have gone missing. Motorists and hitchhikers, those passing through or living in one of the small towns scattered along the region, have fallen prey time and again. And no killer or abductor who has stalked the highway has ever been brought to justice.Hailey McBride calls Cold Creek home. Her father taught her to respect nature, how to live and survive off the land, and to never travel the highway alone. Now he\u2019s gone, leaving her a teenage orphan in the care of her aunt whose police officer husband uses his badge as a means to bully and control Hailey. Overwhelmed by grief and forbidden to work, socialize, or date, Hailey vanishes into the mountainous terrain, hoping everyone will believe she\u2019s left town. Rumors spread that she was taken by the highway killer - who\u2019s claimed another victim over the summer.One year later, Beth Chevalier arrives in Cold Creek, where her sister Amber lived - and where she was murdered. Estranged from her parents and seeking closure, Beth takes a waitressing job at the local diner, just as Amber did, desperate to understand what happened to her and why. But Beth\u2019s search for answers puts a target on her back - and threatens to reveal the truth behind Hailey\u2019s disappearance....A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press \"Dark Roads is a chilling, pulse-pounding thriller that also tugs at the heartstrings. It's everything you've come to love from a master of the psych thriller genre!\" (Mary Kubica, New York Times bestselling author of The Other Mrs.)\"My favorite Chevy Stevens book since Still Missing. Stevens reliably creates complex, resilient female characters, and Hailey and Beth - whose lives collide in Dark Roads - are utterly compelling. The suspense builds with every page, and the ending is a complete shocker.\" (Sarah Pekkanen, number one New York Times best-selling Author of The Wife Between Us) Read more",

At first I was unsure if I would like it but by the end of the first chapter I was hooked. I also finished this in a day. I do wish more of this authors books were on kindle unlimited.

I was so looking forward to this book but it fell short for me.The first 2/3 of the book felt like it was written by someone else and didn't hold any of those intense thriller aspects that I love in Chevy's books. Frankly, it was hard for me to get into and I wasn't invested at all.The last 1/3 of the book, when it all came together, was more like what I expect when picking up a book by this author.I'd recommend this book for readers who have never read a Chevy Stevens book before. If, like me, you've read them all, go into this one expecting a different kind of story than what she usually tells.",

I could not stop reading, I was absolutely had to know what was going to happen next!<b>SUMMARY</b>Seventeen year old Hailey lost her beloved father in a car accident, making her an orphan. She always believed that her mother's premature death by cancer would be the worst thing she would have to live through, but it turns out she was wrong. She was sent to live with her aunt who happens to be married to Vaughan, the unyielding police chief of their small British Columbian mountain town.Vaughn does not approve of much that happens in their town and particularly disapproves of Hailey's BFF Jonny. He seems hell bent on controlling Hailey and trying to find a reason to bust Jonny.In addition to Hailey's family drama, the town has a long history of women going missing along the highway that runs through town. For decades women have mysteriously disappeared, some bodies have been found, others have never been found. This small town has a lot of natural beauty, with its mountains and lakes, it attracts many campers and hikers. No one has ever been sure if the murderer is local or a trucker or tourist who passes through regularly.Hailey becomes extremely uncomfortable under her uncle's control and makes a plan to escape. The more Hailey digs, the more reasons she finds to get as far away from Vaughn as possible. Around that same time, another girl disappears and things in this already tense town reach a boiling point.Then Beth, the sister of the most recent victim, pops up in town, also looking for answers and stirs things up even more. Something has got to give! The plot takes the reader on a fast paced, unpredictable journey with Hailey, Jonny and Beth, none of whom will give up until the truth is uncovered.<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>I'm a big Chevy Stevens fan! This is my fourth Chevy Stevens book and definitely my favorite. Looking back at <i>Never Knowing</i>, <i>Still Missing</i> and <i>Never Let You Go</i>, I liked all of them, but in this book, Stevens seems to have mastered writing a thriller. The suspense sucked me right in. Although I knew this is a work of fiction, I found myself stressing out over the safety of this seventeen year old girl! I felt like I HAD to keep reading, if I stopped, she'd be stuck in limbo. Its safe to say I was very absorbed in the book and invested in all the characters.I LOVED the setting! British Columbia is such a beautiful place. I visited once and have never stopped thinking about it. I loved reading about this lovely town and could picture it in my head.The suspense was fantastic! I loved it all.There was a LGBTQ aspect to the story, a relationship between two girls. I loved the way it was woven into the story in a way that didn't distract from the plot but was undeniably there. I think we will see a lot more of that in literature moving forward.There was a fantastic dog. He was everything a dog should be; loyal, smart, loving and funny. I loved him!<b>WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE</b>There was really nothing I didn't like about the book, hence my 4.5 rating. It's not quite timeless enough to be a 5, but very few books are per my rating scale.<b>OVERALL</b>If you like fast paced thrillers and getting emotionally attached to characters, this is the book for you! I loved it and wish it was not over while simultaneously being happy for the characters that they have had some sort of resolution.",

In Hailey, Chevy Stevens has conjured up a seventeen year old going on forty. After losing her father in a tragic accident, the girl is forced to live with her maternal aunt and herdictatorial police officer, husband. Monitoring her life, the officer keeps her on a tight leash and forces Haley to sneak out to join her friends. Wanting to escape from under his thumb, Haley runs away and lives in a minors cabin deep in the forest. It is thought that she is another victim of the cold creek highway murderer.Haley\u2019s friend Amber is murdered and another victim of the cold Creek highway. When Amber sister BETH arrives in town. She is determined to find out who murdered her sister. What she and covers is shocking.This was a dark story in the subject matter difficult to grasp in that so many girls have been victims. To say I enjoyed this book doesn\u2019t pay justice. It really held my interest and I felt the angst Haley and BETH experienced.",
