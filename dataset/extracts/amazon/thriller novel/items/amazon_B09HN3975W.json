When Jack, Jr. visits South Korea with Lisanne to meet with a future Campus helper, he unexpectedly finds himself in the midst of a turmoil that engulfs all of South Korea. Amidst the chaos, Jack, Jr. reunites with the Green Berets duo he met in the previous Syrian episode. With the help of the duo, Jack, Jr\u2019s strenuous efforts begin. What emerged as the background of various events was the movement of a within North Korea. It was a coup d\u2019etat attempt by an influential Politburo member to seize power while the supreme leader was recovering from radiation exposure during testing of a Soviet-made nuclear warhead cruise missile. He plans to unify Korea, force the North Korean army to go south, and is trying to shake the world with a nuclear-equipped cruise missile. The domestic unrest in South Korea was the work of North Korean sleepers in response to this move. Will Jack, Jr. be able to stop this movement in \u201cZero Hour\u201d before the cruise missile launches?In the episode, a character who seems to be Kim Yo Jong appears. While enlisting Jack, Jr.\u2019s cooperation, she tries to prevent a coup d\u2019etat and and is shot down. It seems like an interesting attempt to try to understand what she really means in the episode by looking at her real life through the media. The thing that caught my attention the most was the North Korean commandos led by Ju Min Jun. Where does their sense of mission and passion for following orders come from? Even if their families\u2019 peace is threatened, don\u2019t they have time to calmly judge their actions in light of good and bad? Jack, Jr., by contrast, recalls a conversation with his father before moving into action. \u201cThe trick is to never give in to evil\u2019s stain. Never stop fighting for what is noble and good in the name of expediency.\u201d These words guide Jack, Jr.\u2019s action and are the source of his strength. Perhaps because of his experience as an Apache helicopter pilot, Don Bentley\u2019s depictions of the inside of the cockpit piloted by Mike Reese are full of realism. Can\u2019t wait for his third book in this series.",

I believe it's packed with action, and there's a particularly thrilling episode involving Korean soldiers that left me impressed. The only thing that left me wanting more was the part about the Campus team. Their involvement wasn't well expressed, and I wish the story would return to its origins, where they operated realistically and covertly as originally conceived by Clancy. I appreciated the inclusion of the snipers, who will later become a crucial part of the Campus, but I would have liked more depth for characters that have been established in previous installments. A general suggestion is to please maintain the storyline's continuity; Jerry Heandley, who makes important decisions, seems to have been forgotten, and Ding's role has been downplayed from his potential. Overall, this adventure is quite thrilling \u2013 don't miss out on reading it.",
