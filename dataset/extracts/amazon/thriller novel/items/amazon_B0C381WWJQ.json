        "description": "In the thrilling first crime novel from former FBI director James Comey, a murder investigation reveals deadly connections between high-ranking politicians and the mafiaWhen a years-long case against a powerful mobster finally cracks and an unimpeachable witness takes the stand, federal prosecutor Nora Carleton is looking forward to putting the defendant away for good. The mobster, though, has other plans. As the witness's testimony concludes, a note is passed to the prosecution offering up information into the assassination of a disgraced former New York governor, murdered in his penthouse apartment just days before. It's enough to blow the case wide open, and to send Nora into a high-stakes investigation of conspiracy, corruption, and danger.Drawing from the author's decades in federal law enforcement, including his years in Manhattan as a mob prosecutor and later the chief federal prosecutor, Central Park West is a fast-paced legal thriller with an intriguing plot enriched by real-life details and experiences. That unique perspective gives the novel much of its allure, but it's the unforgettable characters, shocking twists, and courtroom scenes as authentic as they are dramatic that will leave listeners looking forward to more from this bold new talent in the genre.

                "reviewText": "Given the author's long career and background in the criminal justice field, I was intrigued to dive into this crime case and to see if Comey could take the leap from non-fiction to fiction; and to reveal a little more of what goes on behind the scenes of a criminal investigation and how it all plays out in court. I was not disappointed. The characters were interesting, and the plot had enough drama and excitement to hold me to the page and there was a twist at the end that pushed it a little higher up on my rating scale. I think the inner workings of our justice system isn't quite understood or appreciated by the average American who is watching it from the outside. Comey's Crime Novel reveals both the good and the not so good components of how justice is approached in America. Do the good guys always win? No, they don't. In this true to life fictional story deals are made that would make many law-abiding citizens cringe but it is the way that it is done. It can be messy and deadly, and it can haunt many people like Comey for the rest of their lives.I hope Mr. Comey continues his new career as both a non-fiction and fictional writer. He is very good at it. I loved Central Park West: A Crime Novel.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible debut thriller from James Comey!",
                "reviewText": "This I learned from the former FBI Director: if you consistently order from the Starbucks secret menu, even while in disguise, using a burner phone, and paying cash, the FBI can find you.Let\u2019s welcome James Comey to the group of crime novelists who really know what goes on behind the scenes \u2014 his knowledgeable descriptions in this debut novel assure you that he has insider knowledge about the way federal attorneys and FBI agents really work (not as lone wolves with secret past personal histories driving them forward).This is a legal thriller that primarily follows Nora Carleton, a US Attorney, dealing with organized crime, whose latest case has a connection to the murder of a Harvey Weinstein-ish ex-governor. The \u201cLuv Guv\u2019s\u201d ex-wife has been accused of the murder, but Nora\u2019s federal defendant in another case opens a suspicion that maybe the swine-ish politician was knocked off by the mob. Included on Nora\u2019s team is a seasoned ex-cop investigator, Benny, and a fresh out of Quantico FBI agent, Jessica. She also has Carmen, an experienced boss, supporting her. There is some warring between the FBI and NYPD and their respective attorneys, so it is necessary to keep a scorecard. For whatever reason, the Manhattan DA does not want the feds affecting the sensational murder case, so it\u2019s up to the United States Attorney team to determine if Kyra Burke is being framed even as the trial is ongoing.I appreciated the lengthy procedural and acronym explanations that lended to the authenticity and complicity of the novel. (No yarn strings for the FBI, just different colored Expo markers). This is a psychological drama about whether the justice system will work properly (is there a \u201cnexus\u201d or we can\u2019t prosecute even though we have a pile of evidence?) provides as much suspense as the whodunit. And, surprisingly, from a new male author, women are the primary good guys (Nora, Jessica, Carmen, Kyra) and integral to the plot. Comey\u2019s insider knowledge can also be scary \u2014 as when he talks about the digital dust we all leave behind (not just from our phones) with likes, logins, Starbucks orders (!), Uber rides, Google geolocations, that the government can sweep into a pile and collect a \u201cpretty detailed picture of a life.\u201dThis turns out to be a suspenseful, believable story, very worthy of a continuing series, if Comey chooses to reunite this team in the future. 5Literary Pet Peeve Checklist:Green Eyes (only 2% of the real world, yet it seems like 90% of all fictional females): YES Dominic \u201cThe Nose\u201d D\u2019Amico has penetrating green eyes.Horticultural Faux Pas (plants out of season or growing zones, like daffodils in autumn or bougainvillea in Alaska): NO But I had to look up the garden-like Pomander Walk to see if it was a real place.",

It was fun trying to deduce which real life characters inspired the make believe. The characters are well drawn and definitely have an emotional tie to the reader. The plot flows very smoothly.The reason for only four stars is probably partly prejudicial, I hate to give Comey credit for anything, and partly because I figured out who the guilty parties were early on in the book. I just didn't know how they pulled it off.All in all, well written and entertaining. I'm sorry to say it but Mr. Comey has entered the list of must buy authors.",

Courtroom and family life add to the mix, making this a great read. The ending was a surprise, didn't see it coming. Definitely in the top three favourite books I've read this year.",

Unfortunately (in spite of my great respect for the author and his integrity) I struggled to connect with any of the characters in this novel. The descriptions of legal proceedings were detailed and interesting, as were the investigative elements. But overall, the book was not outstanding.",

                "reviewTitle": "very entertaining, and well worthy of the hype that attended its publication",
                "reviewText": "I was initially wary about reading this, worried that the hype around it might be deceptive. The author is, after all, James Comey, former head of the FBI, who was peremptorily dismissed in 2017 by President Trump. I wondered whether it was the back story that had really been behind all the plaudits strewn over the cover. Indeed, owing to my Jock parsimony, it was only because I was offered the Kindle version at a bargain price that I decided to take a punt on it.In fact, my fears were unfounded, and this is a very enjoyable legal thriller, following the investigation and subsequent prosecutions arising from the murder of a former Governor of New York. Comey highlights the tensions between the local District Attorney\u2019s office and its federal counterpart, and different investigative approaches adopted by the New York Police department and the FBI.Comey does not waste much time developing his characters \u2013 this is a plot driven story, but none the worse for that. In the tradition of John Grisham and the recent flood of legal thriller writers, he keeps the story moving, but never compromises its plausibility.I am a huge fan of Michael Connelly, and would have to say that this book lacks the polish of his novels featuring Mickey Haller, the \u2018Lincoln Lawyer\u2019. Still, Connelly has been writing novels for more than thirty years, while I believe this is Comey\u2019s first. I hope it won\u2019t be his last.",
