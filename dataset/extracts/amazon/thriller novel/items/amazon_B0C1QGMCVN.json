                "reviewText": "In the future, America finds a way to solve most problems of unhappiness, boredom, and criminal activity. Virtual reality and brain implants seem to control impulses or let the impulses fly in an imaginary space, keeping people safe. However, some crimes still happen. Mind Burn by T. E. Bakutis and Rhett C. Bruno is the story of two futuristic detectives who utilize advanced tech methods to solve those crimes to which they are assigned. I loved this \u201cLaw and Order\u201d set many years from now and the special characters within it. The novel is voiced in the point of view of several different characters, but mostly by the two detectives who are partners on their first case. The writing is descriptive, as it should be in a highly detailed technological situation. You do not have to be an IT grad to read this book, the science is well explained. However it flows at a great pace, keeping the reader engaged. As clues stop surfacing on one case, another crime happens, making the partners seem realistically overworked and real. The Mission Impossible type ending is a bit long and explosive but does tie up the crime. Mind Burn is a science fiction police procedural with great world building including laws and government offices so different from today. I am hoping that a series begins with all the crew, brain augmentation and relationships created in this novel. I suggest for those who like Blake Crouch.",
