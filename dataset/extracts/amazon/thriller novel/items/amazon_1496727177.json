The chapters are confusing as hell because they\u2019re not in first person and just say he\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d so idk who tf is talking.And what happened to the judge?? Did Garrett kill Jim?

                "reviewText": "I originally downloaded this on KU because I was trying to earn an achievement. The premise of the book sounded good enough and it is a genre I enjoy reading. Little did I know how much I'd love this book.The Quinlan family is murdered by an unseen intruder in the middle of the night. Mother, father and son all gunned down in a matter of minutes, but there is another Quinlan family member who the killer can't find. Alex Quinlan.Thus begins our journey to finding out who the killer is. The chapters switch between POVs and years. Although Alex is the main focus there are surrounding cases and people who enter into the story.This book had twists that left my jaw open and just when I thought I had the whole book figured out BAM a new twist and this one was a doozy. Although I believe the book was insanely long, it needed to be. I believe it needed the different avenues and other cases to help build the clues. I will say the pace is somewhat slow to start off but once things get rolling they really start rolling.There are definitely some trigger warnings in the book, all necessary to the story but there is s3x trafficking, SA, child SA, (g)rape and of course deaths.These are my opinions on this book, and I believe everyone finds there ups and downs with every book. I truly enjoyed this one. Especially the ending! Read it for yourself it may not be for you and that's ok. For me it made me realize I may enjoy this genre more than I realized!",

But, the more books I read, by many authors I've never heard of before (thanks to Kindle Unlimited), I've become more reserved in my ratings.That's not to say anything negative about this book or the author. I simply reserve 5 star ratings for really great books.Empty Eyes was a truly good read. Mr. Donlea has a style of writing that kept me interested and intrigued. Even the details that may seem too much at the time are written in a way that kept me reading. I thoroughly enjoyed it!I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery with some twists that you won't expect. And to anyone who appreciates an author with a superior writing style that keeps you wanting to read even when you know you should get back to your daily responsibilities or get some sleep so that you can function the next day.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first Charlie Donlea book and I\u2019m so happy it crossed my reading list! The storyline was awesomely laid out through a meticulous layering of life stories of many characters all overlapping with the finest of threads connecting the dots between the seemingly unrelated clues held to the murder board of Those Empty Eyes. I was lead down a path traveled by the innocent, the abused, those trusted to pursue justice, those responsible for providing justice, and those willing to end the lives of the guilty when all others failed to provide justice to the innocent and abused as well as their families. This book will keep you reading long into the night and early again the next morning IF you are able to lay it down at all. I highly recommend this book!!",

                "reviewText": "The best thing about this is the way it puts everything out in these short, article like pieces. Those pieces are quick and easy to read through, so it really feels like you're tearing through the story.Except you aren't.That's the worst thing about this. It's longer than it needs to be. Twists and reveals are interesting, but too slow in occurring. Information gets repeated a few times like we've likely forgotten it and some of it was easily overlooked, but I tried to read this as quickly as I could so those details hadn't escaped me. Staying more focused on the central story rather than building up all the sidestories would have eliminated the need to repeat and retread elements of the story.The mid aspects of the story are its intent. It does well as commentary for and against the true crime community and obsessive nature of media for stories like this. The glorification, villainization and tokenization of victims based on the seeming whims of certain opinions or trends is fascinating to study, but not really the focus of this story. I think, for that reason, it's actually a pretty neutral story and wants to just show both sides without firmly aligning with or against true crime enthusiasts. Rather it wants all attention on the idea of justice with or without the courts. The clearer commentary is on how some are able to skirt justice through wealth, power and/or influence. I liked how the book handled that. A little vigilante action is always somewhat cathartic, but the buildup was longer and more involved than necessary. Arguments can be made for and against all the elements that were woven in. All the pieces did have a place and it all fit into the picture that the author wanted to present, but the puzzle would have been just as effective with 500 pieces as 1000.",

                "reviewText": "Alexandra Quinlan lost everything the night her family were slaughtered. Years down the line, Alex is still searching for answers and not just for herself. With a narrative that simply does not release its hold for a split second, this is crime fiction to salivate over. The story adds layers as it goes and you are comfortable in the knowledge that every new strand you come across plays its part in the bigger picture. How they do so though, well, that\u2019s the prize awaiting you.With likeable and tangible characters thrown into a storyline most authors could only dream of, this tale thrills, shocks but never fails to entertain. Absolutely top drawer and if this isn\u2019t my book of the year to date, it\u2019s certainly in the top one.",
