        "description": "\u201cWhy run from a haunted house when you can stay and ignore the ghosts? Just when you thought you'd seen everything a haunted house novel could do, The September House comes along and delivers an eerie, darkly funny, and emotionally grounded book about the ghosts that haunt houses and marriages.\"\u2013 Grady Hendrix, New York Times bestselling author of How to Sell a Haunted House A woman is determined to stay in her dream home even after it becomes a haunted nightmare in this thoroughly enjoyable, twisty, and layered debut novel. When Margaret and her husband Hal bought the large Victorian house on Hawthorn Street\u2014for sale at a surprisingly reasonable price\u2014they couldn\u2019t believe they finally had a home of their own. Then they discovered the hauntings. Every September, the walls drip blood. The ghosts of former inhabitants appear, and all of them are terrified of something that lurks in the basement. Most people would flee. Margaret is not most people. Margaret is staying. It\u2019s her house. But after four years Hal can\u2019t take it anymore, and he leaves abruptly. Now, he\u2019s not returning calls, and their daughter Katherine\u2014who knows nothing about the hauntings\u2014arrives, intent on looking for her missing father. To make things worse, September has just begun, and with every attempt Margaret and Katherine make at finding Hal, the hauntings grow more harrowing, because there are some secrets the house needs to keep.

                "reviewText": "The September House is one of the most original thrillers I\u2019ve read in a while. This stunning character-driven story is an emotional roller-coaster: shock, humour, fear, comfort\u2026it has it all!We follow the story of Margaret, who lives in a haunted house with her husband, Hal. Or at least she did, until Hal went missing. Throughout the years of their stay in the house, the couple realized that something wasn\u2019t quite right with the beautiful Victorian mansion\u2014what with the walls bleeding, the endless screaming at night and the unwanted ghostly visitors that would literally take a chomp out of your flesh if you gave them a chance. Eventually, the couple\u2019s only choices were to leave the house, or make peace with it and follow the rules of the entity controlling their lives. Margaret chose the latter. When Hal goes missing, their daughter, Katherine, wants to come stay in the house to investigate her father\u2019s strange vanishing incident\u2026only she isn\u2019t aware that the house is haunted, and Margaret will try everything in her power to stop her daughter from finding out.What stood out to me while reading The September House was the amazing character work. The three main characters are Margaret, Katherine and Fredericka:Margaret could be a truly frustrating character at times\u2014but for valid reasons. Her voice was balanced and well developed, with well-placed humour combined with a sad reality of loneliness and trauma. Watching her process her ever-changing environment and the changes in herself was fascinating, making her feel so very realistic. It is especially interesting watching her live in denial, building coping mechanisms that the reader sees straight through:\u201cThis house was everything I\u2019d ever wanted. Sure, it wasn\u2019t perfect, but sometimes it actually was. Or at least as close as anything could come to perfect in this life, which admittedly was not very close\u2026I knew how to survive here, and I always had the sense that if\u2026I just played by the rules well enough, I could make it into a perfect home\u2026I loved this house. And you didn\u2019t give up on the things you loved.\u201d(Page 191)Katherine was so annoying\u2014in a good way! She helped drive the plot forward by placing constant conflict in her mother\u2019s life, forcing Margaret to question her beliefs and the lies to tells herself to survive. It was Katherine\u2019s character arc that felt the strongest in the end.Fredericka was my favourite character, adding fun and a good deal of sarcasm to the story. I still catch myself thinking \u201cNeeds must when the devil drives\u201d (Page 16) whenever an unpleasant situation that I cannot avoid arises.The story setting was FANTASTIC. Bleeding walls? Victorian d\u00e9cor? Ghosts who snap and love and murder? Hell yes! The setting contributed wonderfully to the overall moodiness and creepy vibes of the book.As for the plot: creative, unpredictable and filled with strong moral codes. I really enjoyed the pace of the story; it built up to an utter wild ride towards the end. Those last few chapters were hectic in all the best ways!What I loved and appreciated most about this book is the theme of finding beauty in darkness:\u201cA leopard cannot change his spots,\u201d she (Fredericka) said before moving into the living room to fluff the pillows.\u201cCan\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d want to,\u201d I (Margaret) thought. \u201cThe spots are part of what makes leopards so beautiful.\u201d(Page 106)The September House inspires one to carry on despite difficult situations, but also evokes a warning of becoming too comfortable with the darkness.5 stars and one of my new favourite books!",

                "reviewText": "I have to say I did not expect this book to be all that it was. I thought it was just going to be your basic ghost/haunted house story... and boy it was not that at all. It was honestly a masterpiece in the way it tackled some tough topics. Margaret may be one of my new favorite characters of all time. She has had a past that is far from ideal and it shows in that she's just like \"oh cool we have ghosts.\" I loved how Margaret had developed these rules for living with the ghosts, an easy task for her considering her entire relationship with Hal is built on these rules. We get a sense pretty early on in the story that Margaret knows where Hal is given her lack of concern when Katherine comes searching for him. I think it was interesting to see how both Katherine and Margaret were victims of Hal's abuse but reacted in such different ways. Margaret has made her life about rules and following them and Katherine has become this angry almost child... at least seen through Margaret's eyes. I think the ghost element was done really well in this book. It was the perfect level of creepy and wait a minute.. is this even real? I think the author took an interesting tactic, because once Katherine comes into the picture we start to question whether or not Margaret is even sane.. It's this beautiful balance of wait a minute what to I even believe is happening right now. I absoultely loved that I only knew one element of this book... and in all fairness it was a pretty obvious one. This whole book took me by surprise to be honest. I adored Margaret even when I was questioning her sanity, because I was like well yeah no wonder. I was rooting for her the whole time. She is probably one of the strongest character's that I have seen written in a long time. And I loved the little ways the author juxtaposed her strength compared to Hal. I went through about 95 theories in the last three chapters of this book. It was insane. The only issue I had was that I wished a few other things had been cleared up or explained more at the end. But overall, this is a killer horror.",

                "reviewText": "The only thing I admired about this book was Margret's nonchalance with all the horror. It definitely took me by surprise and even made me laugh in places, this woman who was so willing to put up with well-- everything. Casually ducking bitey ghost children and cleaved housekeepers. But everything else about the book was weak and slow. Not original with no sense of urgency or stakes. Kind of just read it to get it over with. A horror story with horror that was told by a prim British woman over tea:\"I daresay that waterfall of blood was positively ghastly this morning. Spent all my energy cleaning it. Oh and did I tell you about the gobbets of meat in the sink? Good heavens, I'll be inhaling the smell of pennies and tin for weeks!\"I can't believe I paid full kindle price for this. Refreshingly boring for a horror novel?",
