Broad brush generalizations with no real development of characters. And since this is the first book in this series, I would expect some drama, but found nothing that will cause me to buy book two. Middle school readers may like it, but nothing for an adult reader.",

But I almost quit reading that genre because they all seemed to be the same and I found myself skipping parts like when the attorney gives the opening statement at trial. I now realize those parts were just fillers to make the book longer -and more boring. J.J. Miller did not need any fillers in this book. Everything was perfect: grammer, mystery, edge of your seat. I have already down loaded the next book in the Madison series",

                "reviewText": "This was entertaining, my first read by this author. I'll probably buy another book by the author, J. J. Miller. Not having read \"about the author\" notes, I'm not certain whether he writes primarily for a British audience but, based on quite a few British english uses throughout the book, I think he does.That's probably the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. There were many instances where I had to look things up in order to understand the author's meaning. That's not a very big deal but the author might consider two versions of his books; one for American readers and one for British. (If the author or his editors are interested, I have a couple of pages of things I looked up for clarity.)All in all, a good read.",
