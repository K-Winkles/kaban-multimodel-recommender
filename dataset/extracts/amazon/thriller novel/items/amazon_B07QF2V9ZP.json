And while I understand hnow some of Wayne's reader\"s disappointment in the rapid switch in Charity's personality, I feel that we need to stick around and see what they have in store for us. We need to remember that Charity still has a JOB and is dedicated to that. Can she carry on with that, with her new found empathy/heart? Can she successfully turn it off and on like a switch? Only time will tell. I think the readers need to not bail .... give Wayne and Kimberli a chance to find a happy medium. We don't know what they have planned for the next book, keep an open mind and hang around. This is not a bad book, it is just different from what we have come to expect. For most, it appears that bad-ass Charity is what they prefer. As a woman, I like like strong female characters, as well. Maybe the changes were just not gradual enough for most readers. I did still enjoy the story and certainly will not be running away.",

                "reviewText": "It is getting very difficult to rate Wayne Stinnett books. They are all exceptional stories. And yes, I have read every one and enjoyed every single one immensely. Like John Elseworth, a Wayne Stinnet book will never let you down. However, after reading so many of his titles, I find my self wanting to compare one book to another when I rate them. The truth is, I do have my favorites. However there is not one that I would not highly recommend. All his characters seem to become old friends that get revisited in different stories. There is a real comfort level in reading his books and in reading each book never knowning which of those old friends you are going to get to hear from. And so it is with this story. We find old friends throughout the journey that are always there to lend a helpfuling hand. This book added some depth to Jessie's daughter and her mom and opened the door to maybe a new future for them with Jessie. The book was great, the story fun and interesting, the good guys were as good as ever and the bad guys get what they deserve as is the usual case. So, no mystery there. Wayne's characters are really becoming a kind of far flung family. So open this book up and enjoy. And, welcome home :-)",

I had read all of the adventures of Jesse and Charity that I could find. I hoped all that was happening was just a sabbatical or maybe more writings that weren't done yet. I'm so pleased to find that I was right! Now I just finished both a Jesse book AND a Charity book on kindle! I just went right through them and, of course, I want lots more, right no. It just doesn't work that way! After I finished both of these books plus another Jesse book that I had somehow missed, I read a preview of his next book. Once again, I can hardly wait! I highly recommend that everyone read all of Stinette's books as soon as possible. I also recommend that you read them in order. Honestly, they are excellent any way you read them, but I prefer them in the order in which they have been written.",

We love both of their characters. It is such an unusual thing to see another author's character in someone else's book. Reading Dolphin Spirit, Jesse popped up and I had to reread the title to see which book I'd started. The more I read the more entertained and enthused we became. I LOVE IT. Couldn't wait to get to Wayne's new book. Both books are phenomenal. I think it adds another layer to the characters of both books. I love the way Charity is growing and that there may be a little tiptoeing around an interest in Jesse and the other way around. Can't wait to see how they continue to develop. You have both done an amazing job. What a terrific idea.",

                "reviewText": "Wayne did a fair job, and tackled very tough subjects while writing Charity. He correctly understood his limitations, and picked the right person for the job.I would take this opportunity to ask if he could get her to write the bedroom scenes for his books as well. Fad to black, it's getting old. ;)Kimberli's bedroom scenes said more about Derrick, than 5 pages of deeds... Also added to the Cult book, were the couple meet their end.I shall be reading your series next, on the strength of your writing.Definitely not because of the cross over. That was an utter disaster, ridiculous, clumsy effort, that when removed, made the book 40 pages long and unsatisfactory waste of time. Waste of a terrorist submarine plot, poof its gone. Oh well!3 totally suspicious character's, strange and forced banter.Wayne has achieved the incredible, keeping a series going and advanced time over 17 years. But that crossover was the worst, utterly meaningless and a waste of 60 pages of a new Armstrong Research adventure. Its been 9 months and l'm still upset.",
