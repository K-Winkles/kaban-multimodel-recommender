                "reviewText": "Within a few pages, I predicted what a twist would be and it came halfway through the book- I thought that it was weird and was upset there was so much book left, and then other twists occurred and they weren't good at all.There was alot of 'shocking' imagery that really didn't work for the story and just felt crammed in for cheap, morbid entertainment.Alot of different plot devices were used and none of them were used well. It was like the author scrambled to figure out how to make the story flow and just threw things in as a vain attempt. Example: the tuna can bit- like there was literally no other way that could have been brought about? Also the whole plotlines for Adler and Heather were just a bad crutch.The characters were unlikable. Toni with her twist at the end was lame and just used as an excuse for bad behavior to try to shock the audience or gain sympathy for this unrealistic character. Sunney because he was just wooden and boring.Technically speaking, there were spelling errors, clunky grammar, and the dialogue was not believable- people don't speak like that.There were a few odd word choices that took me out of the story because it was like the author wanted to impress with a few big vocabulary wordsMany bits could have been edited out or revised to flow better. There really was no need for the story to have been that long for what it was- it really needs more revisions, editing, cutting things to make the story more concise and trying to make the story flow without using cheap and clich\u00e9d plot devices to no avail.Overall this was not a good recommendation and a weak story to read.",

                "reviewText": "I should have stopped right there, but I didn't.I would say this book is predictable, and it mostly is, except for the parts that don't make sense at all. Those parts are baffling and add to the general wtf-ness of the story. The characters, though meant to be full of surprises, are boring and one-dimensional. I'm not actually sure if I was supposed to like any of them. (I didn't.)Many of the word choices were extremely strange, like the author wanted to use a big word but didn't know one that worked so she took a took a swing anyway. They were close, but not quite there. \"Amiss\" is not a fancy way to say \"missing\", for example. A few times could be forgiven, but it happened so often on top of the utter absurdity of the story that it was all the more glaring.I really can't recommend this one, unfortunately. Perhaps the author's later works are more polished.",
