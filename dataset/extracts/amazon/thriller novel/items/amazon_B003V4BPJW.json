                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 1866 - 1892 England\u2019s banking industry",
                "reviewText": "The world runs on currency of different kinds: coins, relationships, world-trade, sex, ideas. I enjoyed this novel very much because it reflects the time period of England/Europe and same time mentions that the US Civil War had ended. Living in Colorado, as I do now, this gave me a reference point of what was happening in the \u2018old world\u2019. I know our Civil War history and settling of Old West as people moved in wagon trains. I wanted to know more about England at this time.Children are born into family groups and situations. Hugh Pilaster\u2019s father died. That set him on a life path to be a \u2018poor relation\u2019 in the Pilaster banking family. Banking was considered as \u2018upper middle class\u2019 working positions. Making interest on loans was how a bank succeeds, even today. How well that money is managed determines how successful the bank will be. I looked at this book from several perspectives. What was the banking industry like at that time? Who were these people? And what effect did the management have on others, good or bad.The characters were intriguing! Hugh made his own way after his father\u2019s death. He met Maisie and fell in love. He wasn\u2019t spoiled, like his cousin Edward Pilaster. Edward was overindulged by his mother, Augusta. She was ruthless and manipulative to move her son, Edward, into the head position of the bank. But could Edward do the job?No. We all can reach a level of incompetence where we can\u2019t function. This is a fact even for the 21st century. Follett reveals this. Edward had no ambition, integrity, brains to help the bank move forward. Just because you are son of a lead partner doesn\u2019t automatically mean you can do the job. We see this also today.Women were dependent on their men\u2019s positions. How \u2018well\u2019 you married determined your status and success.As the boys at the elite boys school were all affected from a boy\u2019s drowning, the book focuses on the Pilaster banking family. They were directly involved. Or were they? They were directly affected by the tragic event.Miguel (Micky) Miranda was the protagonist. But so was Augusta Pilaster, Edward\u2019s mother. This leaped off the page for me. How far would they go to get their needs met?These two wonderful characters had their \u2018own secret agendas\u2019 to further advance their lives to wealth and fame. They both were ambitious people and put no limits on themselves to get what they wanted.TV shows today lack revealing the internal thought process of what makes a person do something, what makes a character \u2018tick\u2019. Reading is where I go to find great novels that reveal the inner thought-process.Edward\u2019s indulgence in brothels with friend, Micky Miranda, was an excellent reminder of how men entertained themselves and how women used sex as their trade at that time. It again is a form of currency.I won\u2019t write the ending. It was fascinating to see how far the characters were pushed and what they did.I highly recommend this psychological drama in this novel. It\u2019s about different currencies and what we each trade during our lives.I am age 74, a retired accountant, female. I love books. I learned to read at age 4. My grandmother raised me, pushed me early to read. It was the very best gift I ever received. She and my father taught me how to \u2018think\u2019. He was a business owner. I learned about banking and trade early in life.We all have options. This novel is a great demonstration of this. Yes, the book is about banking. But our choices can determine and define our success.Loved this book! Please read it. It is shocking, intriguing, baffling. Why do people do what they do? It made me think, analyze, reflect.Buy this book!A Colorado Reader Feb 7, 2024",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very Entertaining",
                "reviewText": "In my opinion, Ken Follett is one of the better writers working currently, and A DANGEROUS FORTUNE is one of his best books to date. I liked his EYE OF THE NEEDLE and PILLARS OF THE EARTH very much, too, and while I don't think FORTUNE is quite that good, it is still one of the most entertaining books I've read recently. The story is set in England in the latter half of the 19th century, and revolves around the wealthy Pilaster family. The Pilasters are bankers and control the large and powerful Pilaster Bank. As schoolboys, both Edward Pilaster and his cousin Hugh, son of the family black sheep, are involved in the death by drowning of a fellow student. That event is the beginning of 25 years of intrigue, corruption and murder as the fortunes of the Pilasters and those close to them play out. Follett weaves an intricate and fast-paced, if not always surprising, plot around his characters that carries the reader from the mansions of London's rich and powerful, through seedy bordellos, to vile gambling dens.This is contemporary pulp fiction at its best. The characters have depth and believability and Follett seems to do a good job of evoking the look and feel of the period. The pages roll by quickly and the book is hard to put down. But, if it's so good, why didn't I give it five stars? Generally, I reserve five-star status for books of what I regard to be classic status. Caesar, Tolkien, Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter (yeah, I do think Harry Potter will be around for a long time). Maybe Harry Bosch, although I may have gotten carried away, there. This is, after all, pulp fiction and it just doesn't have the depth of the above. It is very entertaining, though, and I think most readers will enjoy it very much. Consider it a strong four plus and give it a look.",

One problem, the characters often do things that make no sense, jars the narrative, but that's one of the joys of writing fiction, you create a world with characters who must do exactly what you want them to do.While it doesn't have the historical sweep of Pillars of the Earth or the suspenseful intrigue of his spy thrillers like Jackdaws or Eye of the Needle, it is a thoroughly enjoyable novel with a compulsively readable narrative that never flags.",
