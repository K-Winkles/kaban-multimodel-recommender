                "reviewText": "Ham may accept the next job, but I sure won't be reading it. I guess in the next book everybody will still be \"grunting softly\" instead of speaking and replying. That got tiresome. I love the Dustin Stevens books, but this book is very disappointing. I have begun to dislike Ham intensely. The killing is ridiculous, for instance, when she arrives for a meeting with Manson, and an old antagonist gets out of the car and is somewhat polite, she jumps him and murders him on the spot with no compunction, and walks away to casually chat with Manson. That just isn't okay with me. Her forte seems to be killing people, and who knows what happens to their bodies. She is hyped up for the next kill. Personally, I enjoyed everything about the Reed and Billie books, which were far superior to the Ham books. I just can't waste my time reading this book. The first Ham book in this series was good, but the next two are not worthy of Dustin Stevens in my opinion. If this is what the books have come to, I don't know what to look for in his more recent books to read.",

Ham is recruited to sort the mess that results from Alves being paroled and pardoned to exact revenge on the witness and prosecutor who put him away for life. Ham takes it on herself to follow the case through and find who is responsible for the release and the reason behind it, politics and money. A good story but some of the word order seems as if it was written by Yoda.",

                "reviewText": "Like others have said, there is so much filler in this story that it could have been written in about a quarter of the words actually used. I found that the short stabby sentences that were used to describe the musings of the character /story/thread meant I could skip most of the text to get to the point - not a good sign. By way of example, the main character's phone rings and it takes nearly two pages of words before they actually answer the phone!The story itself is nothing new nor nothing special, the plot is a standard one and the main protagonist is so macho it's a wonder they don't fight themselves. I found a couple of typos or misspells depending on what was actually meant, but more importantly, I must remember this author's name as I won't be reading any more of their books if this is actually their style of writing.",
