Even when it becomes clear that Theo and Alicia\u2019s stories come together, I found myself in denial that Alicia did it until the last couple of chapters. Your heart breaks for Alicia as her story unravels throughout the entire book.",

I have to say that throughout most of the book, which did hold my interest, I kept wondering why people thought this was a good book. Its towards the end when I discovered... Oh dang, this book IS fantastic!In my wise middle age, I often find myself guessing right away who could be the culprit of many \"crimes\"....from left their dirty socks in the hallway to who left the backdoor wide open...Mystery novels are not my typical genre preference but when I do five them a go, I tend to try my best to figure out who, what, where, when and why. With The Silent Patient, I honestly had no clue and when i got to the last few pages it was quite the surprise! Absolutely great writing and I can't wait to read more from Alex Michaelides.",

I almost feel frustrated at how close it was to being a mind-bending, psyche-altering experience. But it just missed the 5-star mark by a hair - purely due to the fact that I predicted the ending.Now for preface, I knew there was a twist, so for the whole story I found myself trying to piece it together. It did its job by thrilling me and popping into my everyday thoughts/daydreaming. But because I thought about it so often when I wasn\u2019t able to read it, I pieced it together before I finished.If you are not as stubborn as me to finish the puzzle too early, then it is a great, thrilling read. And I think I am on a thriller kick now - next up, Gone Girl (as recommended by the author).",

You feel so many different emotions as you go through the twists in this story.Alicia is the silent patient who murdered her husband and is now in a psych ward. For years no one has gotten through to her and she hasn't spoken since the murder. In steps Theo a psychotherapist who tries to understand his patients, to listen and to talk. His main goal is to help Alicia after seeing the painting she did after killing her husband.This book entails so much. There is excerpts from Alicia's diary, there's Theos opinions on what's going on, I don't want to give to much away because it's so good. I didn't think I would enjoy this as much as I did but I saw in the authors end discussion notes that he was a fan of Agatha Christie, which is also one of my favorite authors. I can see why I enjoyed it so much after knowing he was influenced by writing like hers!",

E foi divertido que a autora repete um personagem de \u201cThe Silente Patient\u201d em sua outra obra \u201cThe Maidens\u201d, a qual tamb\u00e9m recomendo. Foi legal ver um personagem que eu j\u00e1 conhecia num pr\u00f3ximo livro. Sacada genial!",

I took around 5 days to finish, and the twist at last was so unexpected. The writing is easy to understand. At times, I felt like certain parts were slow and not important, but it all falls in place ultimately.",

I'd previously read The Maidens by this author and adored it so really glad to say this book does live up to the hype!I'm a massive fan of a thriller and more so ones that have a twist to the tale. the twist in this book was so intelligently woven into the story and didn't cheapen the impact at all. The way it's written I'm actually so annoyed at myself that I didn't spot it!! Just a sublime book to get lost in and well drawn characters and very clever writing.",
