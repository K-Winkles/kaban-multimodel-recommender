Muddy Maggie, Governor of Louisiana, is summoned to the White House by President Brandt following the resignation of the Vice President. President Brandt asks her to accept his offer to become his Vice President. Following her Congressional approval, Brandt leaves for a conference involving Russia, Iran, Italy, and other Nations only to have Air Force One crash near the Iranian border, reason unknown. Maggie's concern, recover the black box before any other countries, and her Prosecutor, Reed Montgomery, along with Turk, are tasked to recover the black box. What ensues is an almost out and out war because Russia and Iran along with Turkey get involved, leaving Reed and Turk not only fighting for their lives, but with no clear way to extract from the area. This will keep you turning pages to reveal what happens with them, but also with now President Maggie, the Russians and the Iranians as well as other Nations. Great read.",

                "reviewText": "Brink of War was my introduction to Logan Ryles storytelling and to his Reed Montgomery series. While the author was new to me, I\u2019ve read a significant number of books published by Severn River Publishing and have enjoyed every one, so I figured based on that track record I\u2019d give this series a shot. I\u2019m sure glad I did because this is a series, I fully intend on reading from beginning to end. I love stories where the \u201chero\u201d is so obviously damaged they shouldn\u2019t be able to function, yet they have a deeply ingrained spirit of never quit.If you enjoy books that are not just action-packed but full of political intrigue and backstabbing as well as characters who are either likeable or highly questionable Mr. Ryles Prosecution Force thrillers might be your cup of tea. In my case after reading Brink of War, I purchased books two and three in preparation for book four\u2019s release in August. I guess that might qualify me as a fan of this series and Logan Ryles\u2019 storytelling.",

There were missed opportunities to expand the plot but that wasn't the intent of the writers good quick story was still told and it was memorable enough for me too take a week long break and come back without having to backtrack and catch back up. Worthy of 4.5 stars a s I'll round up this time. Been reading a lot of Ward Laden's writing g and this is just slightly beneath his efforts but in the same rating space.",
