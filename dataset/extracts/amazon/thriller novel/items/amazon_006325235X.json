One of the best books I\u2019ve ever read.\u201d \u2014Lisa Jewell, #1 New York Times bestselling authorNew York Times bestselling author Gillian McAllister has created a thriller unlike any other in this endlessly clever, twisty story of a mother who must move backward through time to prevent tragedy from striking at the heart of her family.Can you stop a murder after it\u2019s already happened?It is midnight on the morning of Halloween, and Jen anxiously waits up for her 18-year-old son, Todd, to return home. But worries about his broken curfew transform into something much more dangerous when Todd finally emerges from the darkness. As Jen watches through the window, she sees her funny, seemingly happy teenage son stab a total stranger.She doesn\u2019t know who the victim is, or why Todd has committed such a devastating act of violence. All she knows is that her life, and Todd\u2019s, have been shattered. After her son is taken into custody, Jen falls asleep in despair. But when she wakes up\u2026it is yesterday. The murder has not happened yet\u2014and there may be a chance to stop it. Each morning, when Jen wakes, she is further back in the past, first weeks, then years, before the murder. And Jen realizes that somewhere in the past lies the trigger for Todd\u2019s terrible crime\u2026and it is her mission to find it, and prevent it from taking place.Both the story of a mother\u2019s love and the sacrifices she will make for her child, and a thriller with a brilliant twist, Wrong Place Wrong Time is a one-of-a-kind novel that begs to be read in one sitting.",

Overall satisfied but wish the book was marketed properly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this book on my kindle based on the reviews. I was a bit dubious that the plot - going back in time - was a bit far fetched but I thought I\u2019d give it a go and boy was I glad I did. Such an intriguing idea to start with the murder and have to work your way back to what might have happened in the past to have got to this point. As humans we ponder this question often; what drives someone to take a particular action? This book explores that theme by gradually going further and further back in time, simultaneously unravelling more and more of the story. It is so intriguing. Would highly recommend.",

                "reviewTitle": "A beautiful thriller of recent times",
                "reviewText": "I randomly came across this and the title caught my curiosity. But it turned out to be one of my favourite thrillers of all time.The book starts pretty slow but soon catches on the speed. A mother, who sees her son stab a stranger. Before she could take it all in and make sense of what is happening , her son gets charged for murder. Who is the person? How can her beloved son become a murder? How could she not see? She is determined to find out answers and prove for herself and the world that her son is innocent. Instead when she wakes up it is the day before...The time travel element added to the murder mystery is a wonderful combination. The author pulls this of with such ease and keeps you guessing throughout the book. The portrayal of the intricate feelings and emotions of the characters is beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone who loves thrillers and also those who want to get started with psychological thrillers. It is a simple and interesting one without anything gory or dark.",
