        "description": "\u201cThe Alienist set in eighteenth-century Stockholm: Brawny, bloody, intricate, enthralling\u2014and the best historical thriller I\u2019ve read in twenty years.\u201d \u2014A.J. Finn, #1 bestselling author of The Woman in the Window \u201cThrilling, unnerving, clever, and beautiful.\u201d \u2014Fredrik Backman, #1 bestselling author of A Man Called Ove \u201cChilling and thought-provoking. Relentless, well-written, and nearly impossible to put down.\u201d \u2014Kirkus Reviews (starred review)One morning in the autumn of 1793, watchman Mikel Cardell is awakened from his drunken slumber with reports of a body seen floating in the Larder, once a pristine lake on Stockholm\u2019s Southern Isle, now a rancid bog. Efforts to identify the bizarrely mutilated corpse are entrusted to incorruptible lawyer Cecil Winge, who enlists Cardell\u2019s help to solve the case. But time is short: Winge\u2019s health is failing, the monarchy is in shambles, and whispered conspiracies and paranoia abound. Winge and Cardell become immersed in a brutal world of guttersnipes and thieves, mercenaries and madams. From a farmer\u2019s son who is lead down a treacherous path when he seeks his fortune in the capital to an orphan girl consigned to the workhouse by a pitiless parish priest, their investigation peels back layer upon layer of the city\u2019s labyrinthine society. The rich and the poor, the pious and the fallen, the living and the dead\u2014all collide and interconnect with the body pulled from the lake. Breathtakingly bold and intricately constructed, The Wolf and the Watchman brings to life the crowded streets, gilded palaces, and dark corners of late-eighteenth-century Stockholm, offering a startling vision of the crimes we commit in the name of justice, and the sacrifices we make in order to survive.

                "reviewText": "1793 Stockholm - a dirty and disgusting city. Every open body of water is an open sewer. Men, women, and even children are prostituted to survive. Out of one of these sewer-lakes a body is discovered. Limbs neatly severed like a surgeon, the eyes and tongue removed. Our protagonists are the titular watchman (watchmen are a mostly corrupt police force which enforce moral laws) with a wooden arm and demons from a past war, and an investigator who is nearly dead from what was then called consumption. They are hunting a wolf... a man that preys upon other men. How really different is he from other men in this city where everyone seemingly preys upon someone else? From \"homo homini lupus est\", which can translate as, \u201cLike a wolf is man to other men.\u201d Other novels have explored this heart of darkness in humanity, but this novel proves you don't have to travel up a river in Africa to find bloodstained teeth in a smile. This debut novel won acclaim and it\u2019s easy to see why. Chilling and haunting.Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "This one, for Nordic Noir, is Nordic and it is sort of noir but not the way you usually think of noir. The setting makes the difference. This is 19th century Stockholm and there are no gangs, no intrepid detectives, and only one real murder. The \u201cdetectives\u201d who end up solving the various mysteries that occur are not even detectives. The \u201cteam\u201d consists of a lawyer with a terminal case of consumption, Cecil Wenge, and a watchman, sort of an \u201ceye on the town\u201d kind of guy, Mickel Cordell. Cordell is usually found in a pub somewhere near the floor. He is an accomplished battler but he has one handicap that actually turns into an advantage: one of his misadventures cost him his left arm but the wooden replacement is heavy enough to do great damages in the fights that he gets into during the story. In one memorable encounter, he remembers fighting but he remembers only after he wakes up from passing out from being drunk: he has two teeth stuck in his arm. The placid existence for the two ends with the discovery of a body in a stagnant sort of bog called the Larder. The body has not been in the water long, but it is unusual in that it has no arms, legs or eyes, making identification difficult, if not impossible. Cardell enlists Winge in attacking the various aspects of the problem of identification and finding out who may have been so brutal as to dismember it while the victim was alive. In the process of finding out who the victim is, we meet a thoroughly disgusting cross-section of late-18th century Sweden: drunks, whores, pimps, cheats, pickpockets, addicts and thieves. We meet the man who amputated the victim\u2019s limbs, we meet the man who told the villain to do it, we meet a wonderful innocent who gets caught up in the life of a prostitute though she is not one and the whole mess of types mingle together in separate chapters to make a wonderfully crazy whole. Winge continues his process of dying, with momentary reprieves while Cardell ties to stop drinking and try coffee to no success. There are heart-stopping escapes, near-death experiences, various states of unconsciousness, almost-loves and all the time there is a crime to be solved. Not your normal noir, it is historical fiction at its best: good history with a good plot and memorable characters. Recommended.",

The author provided a wonderful tour of late 18th Century Stockholm - complete with all the dirt and filth.The book divided into four parts. Part One described the issue and introduced the two primary characters: a prosecutor with an indefinite brief and a former sailor, turned night watchman, who lost much of his arm in battle. These two characters hold one's interest and make the book worthwhile. Section Two describes in gory detail the 'surgery' performed on the poor subject. Part Three outlines how the description of these activities comes to be known. In Parts Two and Three, the two primary characters play almost no part. They return with a vengeance in Part Four to solve the mystery and bring the book to its conclusion. For those finding Part Two too gory for their tastes and Part Three boring (as I did), it's possible to skip them with only a modest effect on the overall enjoyment.",

I know coldness having lived in Alaska most of my adult life, and I know the darkness that robs many of their sanity. But the combination of the two along with terrible abuses from our fellow humans can lead some to the loss of their very humanity, while for others, that journey is what fulfills them. In this book, I FELT every characters emotions as if I was there! I couldn't stop reading, and finished the story at 5 am, satisfied that justice had been completely served! Great feeling!The author Matt Natt och Dag has captured the purity and the monstrosity of the human soul as clearly as his very name, night and day. An amazing debut novel!A MUST READ!

Not for the faint of heart but moments of beauty as well. I loved the characters and there is such atmosphere. True literature and mystery as well. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "A pesar de las buenas cr\u00edticas y de ser tratada como el thriller hist\u00f3rico del a\u00f1o, tiene muchas carencias.La historia est\u00e1 bien, la prosa es magn\u00edfica, pero no es suficiente porque la elecci\u00f3n del autor a la hora de contar los hechos ha sido err\u00f3nea. Al menos, para m\u00ed.Despu\u00e9s de 200 p\u00e1ginas con un thriller cl\u00e1sico, el autor decide pasarse las siguientes 100 p\u00e1ginas \u2014o m\u00e1s\u2014 con una historia que encajar\u00e1 despu\u00e9s con la historia principal pero que hace, a mi forma de ver, que se pierda absolutamente el ritmo de la lectura.Con muchos menos datos hubi\u00e9ramos entendido a los personajes de la misma forma y habr\u00edamos permanecido m\u00e1s conectados a la historia.Un error. No puedo darle m\u00e1s que 3 estrellas (y solo por la magn\u00edfica prosa).",
