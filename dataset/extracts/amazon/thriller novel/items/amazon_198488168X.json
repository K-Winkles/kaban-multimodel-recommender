While it\u2019s only the first week of January, I have a feeling this book will be one of my favorites of 2024.Blythe is determined to break the cycle and become the mother she never had. But when that connection never forms with her daughter, Violet, she fears that motherhood isn\u2019t what she hoped for. When conflict and tragedy come where Violet goes, Blythe suspects that there is something wrong with her daughter. Is it all in her head? Is her intuition correct?The Push is an addictive psychological thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. It\u2019s a story of multi-generational trauma, motherhood, maternal mental health, the argument of nature versus nurture, and the making and breaking of a family.",

We get to know her characters through flashbacks and more importantly through their actions. We decide who they are. This novel never bored me and I'm a tough critic. It moved at a perfectly quick pace. I nearly gave 5 stars; my hesitation was based on my own opinion of how certain characters should have handled impossible situations differently. I won't give anything away by elaborating. This book resonated with me, thrilled me, angered me, and broke my heart. I look forward to this author's next masterpiece. Bravo!",

                "reviewText": "This is a really hard review for me because honestly I can't decide how much I enjoyed the read .I'm not sure if I felt it deserved 3 or 4 stars.I'm going to stick with 3 stars because there was just so many situations with Voilet's and Sam ' s parents that were too unfinished and lacking and never truly discussed or understood between them as a couple. There was one scene where their laughter over a very disturbing situation left me so unhappy and confused as a reader .The back stories of the generations of the women was very interesting and I gravitated to those characters, they made the read for me .I understood them better and related to them more than the main characters.Voilet's parents were just so detached and whiney for me. I first hand understand post partum depression but reading about it for chapters upon chapters was so extreme and heavy so much so that it became too much and where you couldnt relate and say \"I remember those days\" which was a miss for me as the reader .I know some women suffer tremendously with being a new mom but this was more than depression. I can certainly see how this could and does happen and can last a long time and it's just very sad, depressingly so .The whole story is sad, depressing and then disturbing and unsettling and than tragic ,double tragic as per the ending. The ending left me feeling super angry and super sad . I can see how parents can love their children above all things good and very bad but this was way beyond bad behavior.This book wasn't super far fetched but these are characters that make the news at night or a 20/20 special. Is it nature or nurture? It will make you think for sure .All I know is it was upsetting that the mom knew and had serious doubts and concerns and had some real hard proof yet didn't have the support of others until it was and always is too late .But here is my issue and my strong resolve . I truly believe if you love your child and you see them being abused or being abusive at any age you have to get help , get involved, get help no matter what because your child is worth the help and this story just shows that not enough is done at all and it was just not acceptable. I think if the ending would have been about breaking the cycle and getting help it would have been a better read.I don't care if as a parent you have to go against a entire army if your child needs help you get help , go it alone if you have to but get it .I just feel the author should have pushed that change in the cycle because the explanations were there especially with the generations of how everyone got here yet nothing of real substance or consequences happen .I truly wanted to see better help.Know better ,do better especially in today's world. So I'm sticking with 3 stars for this read only because help didn't come when it was so clearly needed. I will say this book will make a excellent book discussion for sure .Did I mention that the ending was so depressing for me.?Hated the ending , it was dark and mysterious and just left you feeling \"now what will happen and unfortunately as a reader you just don't get to know .I'm not a fan of mysterious left to your own thoughts ending.But that is just me .Some will enjoy this book others will not .I didn't hate it or love it ,it just made me feel sad .",

Not because it wasn\u2019t done well - it *was* done well imo, but because of the emotional consistency of weight. It was heavy. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a mom. Or maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a woman. Or maybe it\u2019s because the lack of care and concern for mental illness on all sides of the fence. Important things were collectively disregarded, ignored, or even forgotten on purpose between the characters, and I could only take so much at a time.\u201cI could barely remember the mother I had been. Motherhood is like that- there is only the now. The despair of now, the relief of now.\u201dl was emotionally infuriated over the societal misogyny we can't seem to recognize in our own world.\u201cI couldn't tell you the truth: that I believed there was something wrong with our daughter. You thought the problem was me.\u201cI felt so terribly bad for Blythe. She is brutally honest with nothing and no one to support her. So vulnerable, so alone. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201cI do not wish he and I were alone without her. She talks about him when he's not there. She tells strangers about him. Every once in a while, she asks if we can go to the park alone because she misses time with just me. We do, and we swing side by side, and get vanilla ice cream cones. We go home and he is waiting for us, safe with you. I do not quietly pretend that he is my only child.\u201dI\u2019m not sure if the other timelines blended into the book were necessary, or if they benefited the main story. I think I could have done without them.\u201cI know you believe she did. But you've made it up. You saw something happen that never did. She didn't do it.\u201dSomething you should also know before picking this one up - it\u2019s chapters are unconventional. There are 85 of them and the majority are single pages.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cThe Push\u201d is a captivating novel about four generations of women - Etta, Cecilia, Blythe and Violet. It\u2019s a story about mothers struggling with motherhood and about the impact of actions on the next generations. It\u2019s also a story of the high expectations and the pressure on woman and mothers, and about regrets and grief. It\u2019s about all the feelings some mothers might feel but not supposed to feel (because it would be against this ideal image of a mother) but Audrain has the courage to address those feelings.Blythe Connor is pregnant with her first child, she is intent on being a perfect mother for her daughter, to give her all the love and comfort she never got from her own mother Cecilia.But after giving birth to Violet, Blythe sees herself confronted with a child, that behaves not like other children. But apparently nobody wants to see, what she\u2019s seeing. So, can that be true? Does it only take place in her mind? Could she suffer from postnatal depression and needs help? Or is she projecting her deepest fears, to be a bad mother, on her daughter?Either way, her husband Fox dismisses constantly her feelings. He is basically gaslighting her. This left Blythe in a spiral of self-doubt and self-hatred.But the more her feelings grow, the less Blythe can connect with Violet which leads eventually to Violet\u2018s total resentment of her mother.After their second child Sam is born, Blythe experienced a totally new aspect of motherhood and is blessed with a deep connection to her son. But this bliss comes to a sudden end when fate strikes and brings Blythe to her knees.As I read this novel, I had to think about Paul Harding\u2019s prize winning novel \u201cTinkers\u201d about the three generations of men and how he absolutely failed to describe their linked relationships. This is something, what Ashley Audrain did perfectly. She shows this devastating and shocking connection between Etta, Cecilia, Blythe and Violet.Neither Etta, nor Cecilia wanted to be mothers but were pushed into this role, which influences their behaviour towards their daughters. But also Blythe didn\u2019t chose motherhood for the right reason, not because she really wanted to be a mother but to please her husband as well as to show that she is capable to break the abusive circle and be the perfect warmly mother she desperately wanted herself.\u201cI started to understand, during those sleepless nights replaying the things I'd overheard, that we are all grown from something. That we carry on the seed, and I was a part of her garden.\u201dThis psychological thriller is beautifully crafted, with short but gripping chapters. It\u2019s a real page turner, I couldn\u2019t put down (ask my sleep).",

I have not been able to get this book out of my head for days.i will be looking for more books by this author",
