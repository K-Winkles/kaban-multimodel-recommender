Even if you start figuring it out as I did you get caught off guard at the end. Finished in 24 hours. I loved the cruise ship setting. Fast paced, with shorter chapters, cliff-hangers and twists galore. Then Boom! The last paragraph was 3 star so I compromised and rated this 4. I went into this blind. Try not to read reviews first if you read it - but man - I had to jump on my phone and google after finishing this book because the ending was like WTH lol. It did hold my attention!",

So it was only until the remaining passengers were \u201cfound\u201d, that it became a little more believable, at least in terms of how they could get away with sedating, with not one person concerned about the passenger group to call a stop to it? You get to thinking \u201coh okay, so these are really dark people doing something diabolically messed up, even killing a group member.The absurdity of it all would ordinarily turn me off and I\u2019d perhaps not even finish it, but I did - only for the suspense.There had better be a sequel as some might send the author disappointing emails. I, on the other hand, would not sit through that again.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not going to give away spoilers to those who want to read this book but I do not like cliffhanger endings for books that are not part of a series. It\u2019s like reading a half-assed class writing project. I might expect this one to get a sold C+.This story takes place aboard a cruise ship with one person, Caz, waking up to find herself completely alone after going to sleep with her partner, Pete. She ends up not being completely alone in the end, with an additional three people, Frannie, Daniel, and Smith, who join her later. They\u2019re placed in impossible situations to survive the passage. But, I\u2019ll not give anything else away to preserve the integrity of the next reader\u2019s experience.These four characters have secrets and pasts, as all people do, and it\u2019s told from Caz\u2019s pov, but I really did get tired of reading about her mum, her dad and his addictions, and her sister, Gemma. He did a bad thing but did I need to read about it fifteen different times throughout the book? It became less tragic with each retelling, and I became less interested.The story had premise but didn\u2019t really know where it wanted to go. It was less suspenseful than it could have been and maybe a little too long. It meandered, lurking in the shadows of Caz\u2019s mind way too often.I wanted to like the book because I generally like reading about places I\u2019ll never go, a cruise ship being one of them. It did reiterate why I won\u2019t go,so kudos for that. Otherwise, it was a story that missed its mark for me.",

                "reviewText": "This was absolutely one of my TOP READS in all of 2023. I was completely blown away by the entire plot, especially the conclusion at the end that left me reeling for days after finishing!Everytime I think back to this book, I remember the profound experience I had while reading! This one will stay with me a long time as it has a huge impact on the psyche.Our main character is on a cruise with her boyfriend. It is the first day of the vacation and we establish that she has never been on a cruise before, let alone had the time of money for vacations prior to this one. This is supposed to be her chance to finally have a special moment for herself. A well deserved break with the person she love.All is well, they are having fun and banter and go to bed with smiles on their faces. When she awakes to an empty bed she assumes her partner has left for breakfast already. But once she leaves their cabin she soon realizes it\u2019s not just her partner that\u2019s missing.There is literally nobody on the entire ship. No passengers, no crew, no captain in the control room. Nada. Nothing. It is entirely a ghost ship and it is in full forward motion in the middle of the ocean with no access to service, wifi or radio networks.When I tell you as a reader you get a sensation of cold dread reading this book, it\u2019s not an exaggeration. Putting yourself in our MCs shoes is no less than pure terror.The events that unfold following are action packed, tense, thrilling and so much to wrap your head around.I\u2019m obsessed, I loved this book, 10/10, 100\u2b50\ufe0fS, everyone needs to go read this book!!",

                "reviewText": "I was \u201clate to the party\u201d in reading this as I have to interspace my thrillers with romance novels for my own sanity lol.I really did enjoy this book, some reviewers were not keen on the actual reasons that they were on the boat but I thought that it was a good plot.I didn\u2019t really like the twist at the end to be honest but I\u2019m guessing our lead character may make an appearance in the next book? The passengers 2 perhaps?Awarded 5 stars though due to the decent plot, the revelations and the amount of research that the author must have put in especially in relation to the schematics of ocean liners.",

                "reviewText": "The premise is mind-bending but OK it's a fiction thriller. However, there are so many holes in the plot it never seems remotely plausible. None of it makes sense - jumping from a cruise ship into the sea in the North Atlantic as part of a reality show being one example. Bonkers. The plot is padded out by boring expositions by the 4 annoying characters. Could have been an interesting take on the lengths people and companies will go to 'entertain' but this does do the job.",
