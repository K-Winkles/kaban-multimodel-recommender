                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Davenport and Flowers Together Again",
                "reviewText": "First, some background. Many years ago, John Sandford began the \u201cPrey\u201d series. These novels all feature protagonist Lucas Davenport. We meet Davenport as a Minneapolis Police Detective Lieutenant. After an extremely eventful career, during the course of which he becomes very wealthy developing on line games and marries an extraordinarily skilled plastic surgeon, he moves to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a state level mini FBI. His adventures continue. He retires and is appointed a Deputy U.S. Marshal at the behest of some very influential federal level politicians whom he rescued from the clutches of desperate criminals. Davenport isn\u2019t a regular Deputy. He has sort of a roving commission, dictated by his very influential sponsors. He unofficially joins a variety of federal investigations.Sandford, some time after beginning the \u201cPrey\u201d series, began a second series featuring BCA Agent Virgil Flowers. Flowers is assigned to a satellite office and assists other police agencies. He is an outdoorsman. Sort of a \u201cflower child\u201d cop. As a sideline, he writes articles for wildlife magazines. While encountering and dealing with a variety of sociopaths. And is about to publish his first novel while working on the second.Several books ago, Sandford decided to partner Davenport and Flowers. This is, I believe, the third joint adventure.Any of the books in either series can be read as a standalone. I\u2019ve been with both since the beginning and heartily recommend both series and the partnership adventures. But, caution, reading all of them is easily a forty book commitment.Now, to the quibble. I\u2019m a retired prosecutor. I look for authenticity in this genre. The books were very authentic\u2026until Davenport became a free lance Deputy Marshal. Now, the premise isn\u2019t implausible. It\u2019s impossible. But, setting this aside, the books, including this one are exceptionally well written. The police seem real. The criminals, especially the sociopaths, are chilling. Sandford\u2019s dialogue is absolutely superb. Especially, the \u201cfiller\u201d conversations. They are,in my opinion, unmatched.This book opens with Lucas and Virgil recuperating from serious gunshot wounds sustained in the last book. Note\u2026in Sandford\u2019s books, the good guys frequently are injured, shot, and occasionally are killed. That gives each book an added edge.A Federal District Court Judge and his two sons are cold bloodedly murdered in a home invasion. The Judge\u2019s wife, an actress and university lecturer is fortunately away from home. The killer spares their infant daughter. This is a joint local, state, federal investigation. Davenport is requested to \u201cdrop in\u201d to the investigation because of the victim\u2019s prominence. Flowers is assigned by the BCA to join Davenport. They shadow the investigation which leads to an unrelated white collar scam involving a charitable umbrella association. Davenport and Flowers slowly unravel the cases. Unbeknownst to them (for a while) they are being shadowed by the Judge\u2019s widow, intent on revenge. There are very suspenseful chase/stalking situations, a couple more murders, and a very meticulous, if somewhat confrontational investigation by our heroes. All of which lead to a satisfactory resolution. The characters are anything but one dimensional. The widow\u2019s thirst for revenge is very interesting. And, there are some surprise reveals. All in all, this is a superb, character driven procedural that I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "as usual. While I laughed at some Virgil-Lucas word play, I didn\u2019t have the lol moments I\u2019m used to with the Prey series. Except a few insignificant references to their young kids, it\u2019s like they weren\u2019t parents at all.SPOILERS: Not having a clear reason for the Sand murders and why Hess felt it was so necessary to kill Maggie has left a big hole; yes, it\u2019s fiction but good fiction & unlike Sandford to leave gaping holes. The insinuation that Hess \u201cmay\u201d have hit on one of the boys is not enough, especially, when pushed, Maggie immediately hit on Hess - why? And no one talking or pushing Maggie to seek mental health is a big loss. (Although, if anyone had harmed a hair on my kids head, I would have gone crazy; not sure I would have been up to meticulous planning & I would probably have been caught & gone to jail.)",

                "reviewText": "Davenport and Flowers always end up in the soup up to their earlobes. Sandford spins a tale like no one else can. I pick up so much of my retired police officer brother in how he presents his characters that I often think he too spent time in a patrol car. A really great story, as usual. These are the makings of screenplays for a great TV series. When will the producers pick up on such a golden opportunity?",

There were two plots - maybe three - if you consider the mental journey of one of the main characters. Lucas and Virgil know each other so well. I hope Sandford continues writing about them. On a side note, there was quite a bit of humor sprinkled in. Maybe Sandford can get a gig in stand-up comedy.",

                "reviewText": "It's hard to write 33 books using the same characters, but Sandford keeps doing it well. The plot is solid, and the players play their parts very well. Their are enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. My misgivings are that there is nothing new. All the characters seem formularized, and although new, the plot seems to be a retread of old plots jumbled all together. There is also only occasional comedic side chatter. I miss other characters that supply that chatter, such as the 2 large detectives seen in prior novels. Overall, though, it is a very readable novel, by a master author.",

                "reviewText": "Another good Prey series read. Lucas is older and recovering from a shooting and as happens to all of us he feels the pains of being older creeping up on him, but he still wants to catch the bad guys. Flowers has never been my favourite, but they worked well together as a team and their banter was pretty good. It must be difficult for Mr Sandford must be struggling to bring new and exciting stories to this series, but he succeeded once again. Hope he can keep going there was a hint of a character for his next book. Hopefully he won\u2019t be like Mr Child and give his character to someone else as that has not worked for Reacher. I actually wish they had killed him off in a last good story that keep going with poor writing.",
