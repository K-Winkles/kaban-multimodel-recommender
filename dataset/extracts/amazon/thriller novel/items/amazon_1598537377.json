                "reviewText": "This title is not inexpensive but readers get five novels within this volume that comes in at over 900 pages so still pretty reasonable overall. The books that are included here reflect a transition in crime fiction away from the neater and less violent books of writers like Agatha Christie. Here, I would say, there is more gritty realism.The general reader may well enjoy these stories. I think that anyone who wants to study mysteries in context and in an academic way will want to add this title to their collection as well.Note: Books included are by Frederic Brown, Dan J. Marlowe, Charles Williams Dorothy B. Hughes and Richard Stark. Several of them are authors with whom I was not familiar.Many thanks to NetGalley and Library of America for this title. All opinions are my own.",
