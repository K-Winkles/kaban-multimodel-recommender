After the body is found, it eventually becomes obvious that one of the guests is responsible for murder. Told from various perspectives and alternating between the present and the days leading up to the murder, the story slowly unfolds before eventually revealing not only the killer, but the victim. In this way, this book is similar to Foley\u2019s next book, The Guest List, where the victim is not revealed until the end. This was an exciting read that was hard to put down.",

I started a bunch of books \"The Covenant of Water\", \"Tom Lake\" etc..and was unable to finish them. The \"Hunting Game\" is a murder mystery with perfectly over-the-top- characters so I guess the who-dun-it aspect kept me moving. Or the motivation to get back into the game on reading. It's been a year, (no new babies or anything, but my husband and I are divorcing, but this was predicated by a bunch of other things, so it's been a year) and I am finding a lot of books just not captivating enough. This book wasn't particularly overly captivating or anything, and the writing at time redundant. We really get beaten over the head with the various characters' personality traits, but I really enjoyed the description of the cold barren landscape. 4/5",

                "reviewText": "This novel was one of the most discussed and hyped crime fiction works of the last year and it is an excellent choice for the fans of authors such as Ruth Ware and Shari Lapena. Lucy Foley is a writer known mainly for her historical fiction books and The Hunting Party is her debut crime novel. It is a closed-room murder mystery taking place in the magnificent setting of the Scottish Highlands where the wild landscape is a character in itself. The main characters are a group of friends from the University of Oxford who are now in their mid-thirties and they decide to take a short break from their everyday reality in the exotic Highlands. They reside in an isolated lodge in the middle of the wilderness and soon tensions begin to rise and old antagonisms are brought into the surface after the first day. Moreover, extreme weather conditions will exclude any chance of communication with the outside world. A crime is going to be committed soon and the reader should focus on each character's thought process and backstory which will prove to be the key behind the murder. There is a pervasive Agatha Christie vibe and it seems that Foley is one of the most zestful fans of the English cozy mystery master.Foley uses a double timeline narrative as the reader is jumping back and forth between the present (2 January 2019) and the past (31/12/2018). In the present timeline, the gamekeeper of the lodge, Doug, a gloomy persona with a violent past, discovers the body of one of the guests. Foley doesn't reveal the identity of the victim, thus duplicating the mystery as the reader has to guess the identity of both the culprit and the victim. In the past timeline, we follow the group of friends' interactions from the moment they set foot in the lodge. We are watching the plot unfolding through the perspective of multiple characters: the gorgeous, attention-seeker Miranda, her meek though self-destructive best friend Kate, and the person who organized the trip to the Highlands, the newest member of the group, Emma. Furthermore, we watch the story's events unravel through the eyes of Doug and his overseer, Heather. All characters are multi-layered and have more than one secrets which are revealed to the reader in a steady, not too fast nor too slow, tempo.Foley's main theme is the corrosion of old friendships and the estrangement between her main characters. They once used to be one body and one soul, but now they all seem to have their own life and problems lacking the sense of closeness and camaraderie that existed during their Oxford years. The constant switching in perspectives allows the reader to become more familiar with some of the protagonists and after the first third of the novel, you will have shaped a general idea of who is who. Some may find it a bit confusing, but in reality, it's a smart trope that the author uses in order to delve deeper in terms of characterization as well as keeping the suspense alive throughout the book's 400 pages. None of the characters are particularly likable as Foley chooses to be strict with her creations. There is plenty of acidic criticism and cruel remarks made by all of them and emotions such as suppressed rage, jealousy, and resentment are ever-present in the characters' inner monologues and dialogue.Even though I enjoyed The Hunting Party, I cannot claim that it is a crime novel that the reader will remember in the years to come. It follows an over-used recipe that has not much to offer in terms of novelty or innovation. Nevertheless, it is a well-crafted work of crime fiction with interesting plot and characters that is worthy of its commercial success. Keep in mind that it is Lucy Foley's debut crime novel so that means that there will be more books in the near future.NOTE: L. Foley's new novel, The Guest List, will be released on May 5, 2020.",

                "reviewText": "This is an Agatha Christie manor house murder mystery dressed up in H&M clothes and served with triple shots and generous helpings of violence. Seven people who became friends while at Oxford have arrived at a remote Scottish hunting lodge for their annual New Year's Eve reunion. Mark has brought his girl friend Emma; Nick has brought his boyfriend Bo. Katie, as always has come alone.Ten years after college, some of these friendships are beginning to fray. Samira and Giles are married and have a child; chugging Dom Perignon by the bottle no longer appeals. Mark's easily triggered temper isn't as excusable as it once was. Miranda, the Golden Girl at Oxford, can't hold on to a job and can't get pregnant. Her husband, Julian, seems to be losing interest. Kate just seems like a drudge as she works at her law firm to make partner.Also staying at the lodge, in its bunkhouse, is an odd Icelandic couple. Heather manages the lodge and Doug serves as a game keeper.When one of the guests goes missing and then is found dead and obviously not accidentally, this New Year's Eve reunion takes a dark turn.Author Lucy Foley tells this story from changing points of view, moving backwards and forwards in time, which adds to the mystery. The victim isn't identified until the very end.If you liked Ruth Ware's THE IT GIRL or Foley's THE GUEST LIST, you'll enjoy this. It's suspenseful but I marked it down because so few of the characters are likable or particularly interesting.",

                "reviewTitle": "Intriguing, complex mystery",
                "reviewText": "This was a complicated character-driven psychological mystery. 9 people, mainly friends from Oxford meet each year over the New Years holiday. They are now in their thirties. There are four couples and a single in this reunion group who have come to a remote hunting lodge in the Scottish wilderness. They have come to celebrate being together and to party. Some have changed and others have not changed enough. They are mainly high achieving professionals and there is a feeling of snobbishness and elitism displayed by some. Also present at the lodge are two backpackers from Iceland and the female manager, Heather, as well as the gamekeeper, Doug. There is also a handyman, but he is away for the holidays. The story begins on January 2 when the body of a guest who was missing for over 24 hours is found murdered. The identity of the newly discovered body is not revealed and the killer and their motive is left a puzzle for the reader. The story is told from various perspectives by some members of the hunting party, and also by the lodge manager and gamekeeper and move back and forth in time from the arrival of the guests until the mystery is finally solved. Each chapter is clearly headed with the date and its narrator. The chapters which are told from the guests\u2019 viewpoints reveals them to be unlikeable, and the others seem boring. It becomes clear that if they were only meeting now, very few would become friends. They have little in common except for a sense of entitlement and elitism. The guest couples are: Emma and Mark. Emma has arranged the vacation. She is a relative newcomer who wants desperately to fit in. Her partner, Mark, has a volatile temper. Samira and Gilles arrive with their baby, which prevent them from participating fully in events. Miranda and Julien are considered the \u2018golden couple\u2019. Rich, self-absorbed and extremely wealthy, good looking and fashionable. Julien is not happy with the rustic setting and its lack of modern technology. Miranda tends to be rude insulting, and flirtatious but gets away with it, as the others are used to her behaviour and try to accept it.Nick and Bo are a gay couple. Bo is from New York City and a recovered drug addict. Kate is the sole lone guest. She is a successful lawyer. She was once best friends with Miranda, but in the intervening time has had no time for her. She was best friends with Nick back in University.Doug, the gamekeeper and Heather, the manager, have moved to this isolated area to be alone, due to separate unfortunate events in their lives. The separate chapters reveal something of the narrator's personality, their past friendships at University, and their impressions of the other members of the group, past and present. Long held dislikes, resentments, jealousies and affairs come to light. There is heavy drinking and some drug taking. People are behaving badly and tensions, once hidden, are simmering to the surface, ready to explode. It is no surprise that one of the guests is murdered, as we discovered at the beginning of the book. A raging snowstorm outside has cut off help from the police by road and even a rescue helicopter is delayed. People are afraid. Not knowing the identity of the murderer, anyone could be in mortal danger. Recommended to readers who like a modern take on the old fashioned 'locked-room' mystery. Where an unsolved murder has been committed amongst a small group of people with no way out in the immediate future. *3.5* to 4 stars",
