I like the way past characters are woven into the crimes. It\u2019s nice to revisit them and their stories. This time we get to go on the climax of a psychopath who has plagued New Orleans for decades. He was almost apprehended several years ago when Rick shot him and thought he was dead. But life is stranger than fiction. When his signature turns up in a murder, he knows the truth is about to get very complicated. There are so many people to investigate. So many reasons why. Excellent read. Get a cup of coffee and settle in with this book. You can read this series in order or they stand alone.",

Please, please, PLEASE can we retire the trope of the woman claiming \"if I live in fear he wins\"? There's living in fear and there's not being a moron, accepting a little protection when a killer is most certainly after you. There's got to be a way to make intelligent female characters a little more intelligent when it comes to survival and still move thrillers along. It's 2023. The characters have read those books. Anyway, this one was difficult to read because it was cruel to characters we're attached to, it teased the next book (I think) and a couple other potential problems that we now know can be enormous in the future, and it left Montoya looking kind of mean.",

                "reviewText": "I have read Lisa Jackson for a long time. I have read every book in this series, and I love both Bentz and Montoya. Having said that, I felt like there was almost too many things going on in this book. Since reading the last story, I had wondered about Cruz Montoya and where his story was going. But here you have Kristi being attacked and her husband winding up dead. Father John back again doing the same old, same old. And, yes, Cruz was part of the story, but still no real meat if you know what I mean. He needs an actual story, and it does seem like it is leading there, but how many books does it take to get there? And, is it too much to ask for the next book to focus on one story? I think that's why I feel like I missed something here - for example, Cruz showing up at the Cooke residence when Kristi was having a showdown with her husband's killer? I don't feel like there was a logical explanation for that. He was at her house, and ran from his brother and just happened to run right to the Cooke place? That didn't gel for me.So only 4 stars for me. Next time, one book, one story, please. :)",

                "reviewText": "I'm at 33% and not enjoying this. I've read loads by author including others in series, some years ago. So despite this, I was confused who what are the characters. Loads of typos and contradictions that make this very wearing and tiring to try and read. I gave up on author a few years ago because quality of her books diminished drastically. Unfortunately this book does nothing to alleviate those perspectives. I just think this whole book is a shambles. Maybe that's why it's reduced to 99p.Eventually finished this but to be honest, skip read loads and even then found more typos, inconsistencies, contradictions. Then the ultimate pet peeve, it ends in a cliffhanger. This is a very muddled book that needed serious editing before being released to paying public.",
