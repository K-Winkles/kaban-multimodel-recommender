                "reviewText": "This is different from most of the Alex Delaware novels. It is a little shorter and it is far more linear. What do I mean by that? Bob Parker used to say that much crime fiction involved going door to door and asking questions. When the questions are answered the book is finished. The alternative is a story with multiple plots, multiple characters, obfuscation, blind alleys, mystification, tricks, puzzles and, ultimately, resolution. THE GHOST ORCHID is, on the other hand, a very straightforward story. A man and a woman (married to another man) are found by his pool in Bel Air. Both are shot through the heart. The novel basically asks the question, who are these people? When the questions are finally answered the story ends.There is a single subplot and it appears to be there for simple relief from the main plot. Alex is asked to handle a custody case in which neither parent has great interest in securing the custody of their adopted son. As it turns out (mini-SPOILER) the custody case illuminates the themes that arise from the primary investigation.The final resolution(s) are brief and to the point. There is no slam-bang conclusion that occupies a fourth to a fifth of the pages (common in JK\u2019s Alex Delaware novels). The fact that the plot architectonics are simple and clear does not suggest that the book lacks urgency or even intensity. The writing is excellent. All of the elements of great fiction (character, plot, setting, theme) are there. It is just more linear and different from the average JK story. (And the title, when it is finally explained, is absolutely superb, unlike some of the JK titles, which can range from excellent to perfunctory.)Enjoy. Five stars.",

They are thoughtful, interesting, realistic and, of course, great mysteries, with great characters.At the end there was a short \u201cconsult\u201d regarding a different case. It\u2019s good that the author includes these other stories to add a bit of respite from the main murder case. But it seemed a bit odd to end with this. I kept expecting a different ending, but it kind of stopped on a positive note.(Guess I\u2019m just the suspicious type! \ud83d\ude1d)Anyway, another great Alex Delaware book. Highly recommended!",

As usual, the plot features well-constructed twists and turns.It\u2019s difficult to write a straightforward police-procedural mystery that holds a reader\u2019s attention for 300 pages. Jonathan Kellerman is the master of this because he combines an intriguing plot will skillful characterizations.One of the best mysteries of the year.",
