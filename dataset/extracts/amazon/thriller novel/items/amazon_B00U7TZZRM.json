                "reviewText": "WARNING! Cliffhanger! This rated about a 4/5 on my trauma scale, because while it\u2019s a good place to leave off, the ending really has you wondering.Scientists have done it, they\u2019ve managed to clone dinosaurs from the Jurassic Era, and with the backing of some important people, John Hammond has managed to create his own park full of them.When concerns are raised, Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ian Malcolm are brought in to assess the situation, only they find way more than they bargained for.Ok this gets a 4/5 stars for two reasons: 1. The beginning. It started off quite slowly, introduced a lot of people and places, and was not nearly as gripping as when they finally reached the island because of it. I will say, however, that parts of the beginning are actually quite creepy, which made it interesting in between the introductions, but those first one hundred pages or so were less evenly paced than the rest. 2. The cliffhanger ending. Somehow I thought it\u2019d actually have an ending, but it didn\u2019t, so you\u2019ll want to have the Lost World lined up.Now, this is actually quite different from the film. Hammond is a far more detestable figure, the kids are reversed in age, and a few characters are far more/less important than they were in the movie.That being said, the book\u2019s pace picks up the minute they reach the island, and suddenly there is action- and a whole lot more adventures than were in the movie.It\u2019s a gripping tale of scientific conceit, and the sheer ego that one man has (actually, more than one) in the belief that they can control nature.Ian Malcolm, was definitely the mouthpiece of the book, with numerous keeper quotes about the audacity of the scientists, while Alan Grant was the physical hero of the piece.Hammond, is the villain, and obnoxiously so; while the little girl Lexie, is the most frustrating and annoying character in the book (I was definitely wanting the T-Rex to eat her at times). I kind of liked the dinosaurs though!Apart from some strong language (understandably), and of course the situations, this is a book that will appeal to those who love a scientific thriller; I\u2019d put it in the PG13 and advanced reader category if you\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s good for kids.A gripping thriller, that has withstood the tests of time quite well, and is a fascinating read for fans of the films.",

                "reviewText": "The first time I read this book was somewhere around 1993-1995, when I was a teenager and well before I had taken any biochemistry or genetics classes. That was a very long time ago, and my memory of this book was probably warped by seeing the movie quite a few times in the years in between.Reading it through for the second time, as an adult, I find this book immensely fun, but there are some problems.The dinosaurs are genetically engineered to need L-lysine, so that if they leave the island, they won\u2019t die. For them, it is an essential amino acid, so it is added to their foods. Guess who also must consume L-lysine because we can\u2019t make it ourselves! That\u2019s right, humans. All essential amino acids are readily available in meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy. Lysine is available in soy, black beans, quinoa, and pumpkin seeds, and chances are many more plants available to dinosaurs that made it off island. But, for the meat eaters, all meat has lysine in it\u2026 so I\u2019m not really sure why this was ever thought to be a \u201cgood idea\u201d. Michael Crichton with his medical school background surely must have known that lysine was an essential amino acid for humans, and while difficult, it isn\u2019t top of the list for vegans to supplement like Vitamin B12.How DNA is talked about\u2026. as a piece of DNA. Presumably, dinosaur genomes comprised a certain number of chromosomes, each species may have had different numbers, such as humans have 46, chimpanzees have 48, it is mostly the same stuff but split up on the different chromosomes. In order to \u201cmake a dinosaur\u201d, or anything from a starting genome, you must have a way for that genetic material to replicate once you inject a genome into an egg that has had the original genetic material blasted out. You can\u2019t just put in one long piece of DNA, you need sites to initiate chromosome replication, you need centrosomes and telomeres. A lot of times, these are very similar on different chromosomes, and assembling a whole genome takes a lot more effort than what was described here.Ugh... the thriller trope with a very young, attractive female scientist (24?) who is an expert in her field, while the male scientists are all mid to late 30s or 40s. And\u2026 she is given absolutely nothing to do. She is the only adult woman for almost the entire book (there are some adult women at the beginning). I know this was written at a different time, but geez this could have been better.\u201cWhen you compared the DNA of man to the DNA of a lowly bacterium, you found that only about 10 percent of the strands were different.\u201d Um nope. This isn\u2019t true now, this wasn\u2019t true in 1990 when this book was published, this has never been true. Some genes overlap, some DNA bounces back and forth between human (or animals) and bacteria, but the genetic material is VERY DIFFERENT in prokaryotes versus eukaryotes. Humans have close to 50% genes in common with a banana, last common ancestor 2 Billion years ago. Humans share around 80% of DNA with fish (last common ancestor 375 Million years ago), and humans share 98% DNA with chimpanzees (last common ancestor ). So\u2026 this 10 percent \u201cdifferent strands\u201d is way out there, even if we were living in a world where dinosaur DNA could be obtained and then used to make some dinos. (This stuff erks me, just like typos in books.)All the computer charts and navigating menus\u2026 which makes up a big part of the book and hasn\u2019t aged well. Velociraptors are attacking and a kid is trying to figure out what buttons to push to turn on the electric fences. I know this was supposed to be riveting climactic stuff, but pushing buttons on a computer just doesn\u2019t get me on the edge of my seat these days.Anyway, I\u2019ve decided to rate it 5 stars, because I read this during the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when I was feeling very nervous about an upcoming surgery, so I needed some escapism and this was a great book for that.",
