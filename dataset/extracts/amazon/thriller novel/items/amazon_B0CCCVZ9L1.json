Heigelmann and it\u2019s just as good as the first one.We find Madison moving on with her life after the events in book 1; she is working at an animal shelter and enjoying her life behind the lens. She still has best friend, Brittany close by who encourages her to get out in the world and maybe date a little. It just so happens that she ends up with one of the detectives who investigated the case that led to the death of her precious son.As Madison and Alex get closer, he starts to wonder about the integrity of some of the guys he works with. Oh, and all the while there is a madman/serial killer who\u2019s been sent by the family to track her down. He kills people to get what he wants along the way. The killer is actually her cousin, Max Himmel. As Max gets closer, so do the Seattle cops that are chasing HIM.I really like this author and was happy to see that it was a trilogy. We get a chance to delve deeper into the characters. I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019d want to have a cuppa with ANYONE except Brittany. She seems like the only normal one out of the whole lot!I am really looking forward to book 3 to see how it all ends up. Unfortunately, I THINK I know where some of it might be going, but I really hope I\u2019m wrong.Thank you to BookSirens and Common Folk Press Publishing for this ARC opportunity. All opinions are my own and given voluntarily.",

I don't know if I like Madison for the way she sets up to kill, or she's just your average neighbor that you don't know whats really going on in her head. This book keeps you on your toes for sure.

Though not necessary, I would suggest reading the first in order to get all the background info. In this story, Madison is able to move on from the death of her boy, and even falls in love. But it seems that disaster is meant to follow her where ever she goes. She is hit with information that spins her world out of control.This book was more condensed then the previous, making the reading more enjoyable. Twists and turns make you wonder who is the victim. The author again takes on hard subjects, so if you are mild of heart, be warned. Looking forward to the next in the series. Thanks to BookSiren for the ARC of this book.",

She met one of the policemen that was involved in her earlier case by chance and according to both of them they are made for each other after getting to know one another. Then you have Ricci who is Shultz\u2019 partner which starts to go south after they do a call together. Shultz goes to his Olson who is his captain to talk to him about what went down. This is when the book gets really exciting because there is something going on between Ricci and Olson. There are many twists in this story and of Madison is the key player with all the characters in the book. I was going to give the book a 3 or 3.5 star rating but I pushed it up to 4 since I really didn\u2019t see the ending coming.I would like to thank C.J. for the ARC.",

This is book two in a series. The author did an outstanding job bridging the two books. He went in to enough \u201crefresher\u201d to pick up where book one left off without making it a complete rewrite of the first book. He, like in book one, makes this story relevant in todays world. So many of societies issues are touched upon in the this series, and you don\u2019t realize it was brought out. This is because it is all told in a voice of love and stability and not judgement. Speaking of stability, Madison has deep rooted, nature vs nurture issues with mental health. She knows right from wrong\u2026her natural tendencies lean toward wrong, but she works hard to live right. Best book I\u2019ve read in a while and very pleased it\u2019s a series.",
