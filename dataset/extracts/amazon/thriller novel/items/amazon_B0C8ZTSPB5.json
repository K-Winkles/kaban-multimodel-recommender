It is a roller coaster of a suspenseful book, that is told through several characters perspectives. I feel like the characters were great, but wish that Luke had been a little bit stronger in his roll, and didn\u2019t act so much and so quickly on his emotion.This book is fully about abusive relationships between family members and couples, mixed in with some drugs and alcohol and a college like lifestyle.",
