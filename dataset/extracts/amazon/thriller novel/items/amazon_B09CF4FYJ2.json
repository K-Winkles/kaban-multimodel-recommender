She\u2019s putting the finishing touches to the book in the face of a terrible winter storm that leaves her stranded with no electricity or phone service.I came into reading this book knowing nothing about it, not having read any reviews. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was a ghost story as well after she finds a small child half frozen in her yard during the storm, who is terrified and mute.Events unfold slowly, the story is told in pieces from the different perspectives of the characters involved, switching from the past events leading up to and including the murders, to present day repercussions. There is a disturbing part where a young woman with a child is being help captive a la \u2018Room\u2019 that ties into the story.There are twists which are very good, but I figured them out before they were revealed. I like being surprised, but it was still really good story telling.",

A slight criticism in that the ending was a bit too cutesy all winding up nicely, but it suited the purpose, so, meh.",
