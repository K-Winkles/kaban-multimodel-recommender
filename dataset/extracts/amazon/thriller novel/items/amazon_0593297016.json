                "reviewText": "Emma and her husband Leo are happily married and the proud parents of Ruby. Alerted by a few odd to explain events, Leo begins to delve into aspects of his wife's life and discovers secrets he was unaware of. After quite a slow start the story picked up pace and the plot became more twisty and interesting than I was anticipating. For the most part the writing and plot are fresh and original. However, certain aspects of the ending let it down a little.",
