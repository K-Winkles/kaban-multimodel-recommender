Brandon Hall is on the case even though he is not a police officer. He will do his best to get results. This case is not easy to solve.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but I\u2019m a sucker for a happy ending and hate when things aren\u2019t completely resolved in the story.There were a lot of shocks, twists, and turns, and this kept me engrossed from first page to last, which is a good thing, because if I don\u2019t, like the story or the characters the book, like the story or the characters the book goes into my did not finish file.There were some miscellaneous characters who really did not add anything to the story, I felt the character descriptions could be a little bit better, and there was just a little bit too much focus on the heroine and her frequent meltdowns. I not saying the meltdowns weren\u2019t valid, but just a little bit too frequent and they distracted from the story.The reason for the four stars, there was an aspect of the story that was not resolved, written off in the epilogue with just two sentences, and I felt that tangent needed more development. It was a critical part of the story, in my opinion, and yet it was brushed off and not resolved. The only reason for that I can think is the author intends to use that aspect as the plot for another story, so I guess we\u2019ll have to see.",

This book was so amazing i was seriously on edge and anxious the entire read. Such a pleasant surprise. 10/10 recommend",

SPOILER ALERT!!First, when the \"doctor\" Olivia decided to take the abused child into her home, she ignored advice to get an alarm system. This makes ZERO sense when she had lost her own daughter years before!! And she's constantly falling asleep at odd hours of the day - why??!!! When the ex-cop Brandon heard directly from the girl about the horrors she had endured, not only did he leave the girl and Olivia (his ex-wife) alone at home (despite the fact that the ex-wife told him she thought she had seen someone outside), but he did NOT tell the cops what he found out!! I just can't keep going. Another free monthly read wasted, although maybe all the options were as bad?",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed reading this, so much so I woke up at 3:30am (when my alarm was set for 6:00am) and decided to delve in and lose sleep over it. I really wanted to find out what happened to Delilah and to make sure that she was ok, after all she went through.I enjoyed the character development for the most part, though I did want some closure with Lisa. I also found the ending a bit anticlimactic. I think that\u2019s because the villain wasn\u2019t as fleshed out as I would like, and because Olivia seemed distant from all the goings-on. There is a lot of \u201ctell\u201d more than \u201cshow\u201d in this book, which gives the impression that it could be shortened. The romance felt unauthentic at times.I feel that the author does have great potential, however, just needs a bit more polish. She really does well with capturing the reader\u2019s heart.",
