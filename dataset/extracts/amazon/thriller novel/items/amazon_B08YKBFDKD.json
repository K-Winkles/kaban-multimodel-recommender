The way Chouinard weaves their stories together removed all fear of confusion. She provided an easy-to-read and compelling saga of three families brought together with unintended consequences.Every scene brings a twist or reversal to the story. Turmoil abounds in the relationships of the six primary characters; there is no single protagonist. While six may seem unmanageable, Chouinard pulls it off in a manner I found successful and easy for a reader to comprehend. Slowly and almost unbeknownst to me, I developed a strong affection for three of the characters and disgust for the other three.Solving the mystery challenged me unsuccessfully until late in the story when Chouinard\u2019s revelations took me by surprise.The Vacation was the first time I read her work\u2014it won\u2019t be the last.",
