                "reviewText": "The Sleep Experiment by Jeremy Bates is a chilling horror tale that will keep readers turning the pages. In 2018, Dr. Roy Wallis, the head of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley is attempting a sleep deprivation experiment using a stimulant gas. With two Australian test subjects under surveillance around the clock, he and his two student assistants (Penny Park and Guru Rampal) will record their findings. These will include general observations as well as various test results. The experiment is scheduled to last twenty-one days. But the situation soon becomes a nightmare.Wallis is fashionable, ambitious, and determined to see the experiment through to its end. Penny is sharp, has a sardonic sense of humor, is an extrovert, and she\u2019s attracted to older men. Guru is intelligent and hopes to eventually help reform the health care system in India. The two test subjects are Sharon and Chad, who met while traveling in Europe, and have become friends.While the prologue and last day of instruction chapters were interesting, the book pacing quickly slows to a crawl as readers gain insight into the various characters during the next two chapters. The following few days get more interesting as readers see how the test subjects behave as they experience boredom, lack of privacy, and endless tests that show physical and mental changes. Readers need to be prepared for a chilling, horrifying, and action-filled horrifying finish. Themes include human experiments, ethics, sleep deprivation, values, and much more.Overall, this is a book that kept me turning the pages after a slow start to see what would happen next. It was initially intriguing and this was followed by shocking.I purchased a copy of this novel. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. Publication date was July 7, 2019.",

                "reviewText": "This isn't a perfect book, but it's one that I tore through fairly quickly.First, the good:The horror and tension in this book are fairly well done. Everything builds up fairly well and while it's apparent early on that things are not OK, that just lends to the horror. It's all something that could translate into a film very easily, to the point where I wouldn't be surprised to discover that the author either created a script for this after writing it or had one outlined already. His strong suit is honestly the scenes of terror, which are the ones that seem to have been lavished upon more. And if I'm being honest, an effect scene of terror and horror can be hard to find.Now the not so good:Some of the characters are pretty one dimensional, especially the two minority characters. They aren't reduced to their exotic-ness, but a large emphasis is put on their race and accents. There is an attempt to give them some depth, but a lot of it tends to focus more on their otherness to the point when certain things happen it just doesn't feel entirely organic. They essentially come across as the cannon fodder characters in horror films, you know - the ones who are too dumb and blind for their own good? Considering that these were both highly intelligent students in one of the top universities in the US, it's disappointing to see that there wasn't more emphasis on things that would make them more likely to do the things that they do. For example, it's established with Herbert West (Reanimator) that he lacks the human compassion and ethics that a normal person would, making him a sociopath. You get a little of that here, but not enough to justify everything. The Korean character, Penny Park, is reduced to just a schoolgirl lusting after her teacher. This could have been justified by establishing a history that she's hugely competitive and that she's always gotten every guy she set her gaze on. (There's some content to this effect but not really enough to where I would say it justifies her actions.)Still, in the end I really enjoyed this and it's fun enough that I'll check out the author's other books in the series. I saw that one of the other reviewers said his other books are stronger, so hopefully the characters will be a bit more fleshed out. (Ha! - you'll understand why that turn of phrase is kind of funny here after reading the book!)",

Around the fifth day I had to start using hardcore drugs to stay awake. After starting the drugs I was fully capable of staying awake. Then on about the seventh day I started seeing shadow people. They weren\u2019t to terrible, I just had to wear shoes all the time to keep them from stealing my ankles. Then from the eighth day to the thirteen day I kept seeing mushrooms coming out of my head in the mirror which was a bit of a concern to me so I peeled the skin off my face and that solved that problem. But on the fourteenth day. I threw a small Indian man into a wall and turned a police officer into confetti. But after that I got the best sleep of my life.10/10 would recommend",

                "reviewText": "Its a solid novel with well written characters and a good thrill.The only reason for the missing 1 star is my personal preference.Imo there is a little too much backstory told about the characters. Some readers may love this as it might make the story feel more authentic and in consequence more thrilling overall. To me the way some of the characters are introduced feels wordy, boring and unnecessary. As an example Stephen Kind's Cell barely tells any backstory of the characters, yet they still feel real and believable.All in all i would have enjoyed as well as expected to read more about the experiment and its suspects than the ones conducting it and their personal life. However many might like the way it's actually written best, this is just my opinion. Thus and because of the really strong middle part and ending : solid 4/5",
