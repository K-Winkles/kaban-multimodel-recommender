Plus the characters are like real people, not the all too perfect super hero characters of most other special op books. These guys (and gals) rib each other, argue, have fun together but when it's time to gear up, they're all in, all one team. All that, plus i always learn something reading this series.Thanks, Brad Taylor!",

I do wish Pike hadn\u2019t kept harping on so much about the mission \u201cnot being in our charter\u201d. Ya ya, we get it. Spoilers alert here: The biggest hole in the plot was the fact that the Valkyrie team didn\u2019t need the Wolfs AT ALL to accomplish their mission and lead an impossibly convoluted series of threads for the GRU to pull on throughout the book. They could have simply accomplished the task themselves using 2 or 3 guys.",

His research into the areas he covers is impeccable. You feel yourself in old town squares, in ancient cathedrals, cold on a ferry or a cove. His plots are so well developed and flow so well from one aspect into the next part of the theme of the book. ALL of his books are outstanding and this one is no different. Can't wait for the next one.",
