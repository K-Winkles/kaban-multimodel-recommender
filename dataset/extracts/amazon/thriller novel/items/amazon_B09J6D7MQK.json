Wonderful characters, well written, original and all should be best sellers. I read avg 40+ novels a month and why this author's novels not at top of best seller list unbelievable. Better then Lisa Regan, Kendra Elliott and Ellie Grey by far. Clean romance. Horrific bad guy.s, serial killers and more. A must read.",
