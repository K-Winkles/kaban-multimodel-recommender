It's a financially skewed police procedural with a likeable detective with his own personal trajectory at its heart, and it's something of a \"locked room mystery\". The fact that the \"locked room\" is neither in a vicarage, nor on an island, but somewhere in the claustrophobic vastness of the Australian bush renders Force of Nature all the more original and engaging.\u201d\u2015Sydney Morning Herald\u201cAs thick with menace as the bush that seems to swallow the difficult Alice\u2026Force of Nature cuts between past and present, corporate and domestic, and cements its author as one of Australia\u2019s boldest thriller writers.\u201d \u2015Australian Women\u2019s Weekly\"The narrative is finely constructed, with perfectly measured pace and suspense. So much so that it reminded me of another master of form, Liane Moriarty...There are echoes of Picnic at Hanging Rock and Lord of the Flies as any appearance of civility slips away and the women lose direction in a hostile landscape.\"\u2015The Saturday Paper (Aus)\"Harper\u2019s mastery of pace makes Force Of Nature one of 2017\u2019s best thrillers.\"\u2015Elle (Aus)\"Gripping thriller will have readers hooked.\"\u2015Sunday Telegraph \"Force of Nature proves Jane Harper, author of The Dry, is no one-hit wonder.

Maybe because this wasn\u2019t so much focused on Aaron. He had his moments remembering his father and coming to terms with his past, but it felt more muted with this book. Add in the mystery, which was actually really good, but it wasn\u2019t really solved by anyone. We just see what happened in the flashbacks. The cops don\u2019t really do much to crack the case open. It felt like they stumbled into the answer. The constant changing of present to past with each chapter started to feel tedious by the end. Add in the story-lines which went nowhere and I\u2019m not sure this is one I\u2019ll be rereading.So, would I recommend? Yes. It wasn\u2019t bad, just didn\u2019t stand out as much to me as the first and third book.",

                "reviewText": "Remember the fun stuff you did at summer camp? When you were a boy scout or a campfire girl? Bass fishing at the lake? Sightseeing in the national park? What can be more enjoyable than sitting around a bonfire toasting marshmallows, roasting hot dogs, and telling ghost stories on a warm, moon-lit summer night? Singing \"Home on the Range,\" \"Good-bye Old Paint,\" and other traditional favorites. Hiking the trail, canoeing, spying wild animals in their natural habitats through your binoculars. How peaceful and serene it all seemed! Or, perhaps, you went out to a scenic secluded spot in a remote recreational area just so you and your best buddies could drink beer and listen to the music on a newly installed AM FM stereo radio-CD player played really loud, without disturbing anyone outside a radius of about two city blocks, while you listened to \"Dark Side of the Moon.\" You thought about installing a C.B. radio underneath the dashboard as well, but you were twenty-one, on a limited budget, didn't really need one, and couldn't afford one anyway. Now someone is thinking how the world has changed so very rapidly and dramatically, how nothing can ever really be the same as it once was. He probably thinks how he has more survival skills in his little pinky finger than all of the corporate executives combined gone fishing, hiking, bird-watching, or relaxing in their easy chairs, seated in friendly, comfortable surroundings, drinking aperitifs and telling jokes at the lodge for the duration of their long lost week-end in the national forest have in their whole bodies. He wanted to re-live the wonder years of his youth, so he volunteered as an active participant in the next corporate retreat to the great outdoors. The destination is none other than the incredible Outback of \"Crocodile Dundee's\" Australian wilderness. This is the gist of the novel, Force of Nature, written by Jane Harper, published in 2017. The story becomes very interesting quite quickly. As suspense-filled and intriguing as the question I just made up is loaded: \"Being strictly vegetarians, what were you able to survive on besides bush-meat?\" An avid book reader, one has a great tendency to look for the moral in the story--even if there doesn't appear to be one at first glance. For this particular book, although \"laughter is not necessarily the best medicine,\" having slightly modified the title of the \"Readers Digest\" periodical column, one might offer the aphorism, \"He who laughs last, laughs best\" as an alternative. But that's not right either. What transpires on their trip is no laughing matter. All right. So I ask myself a simple rhetorical question, \"What is the story about then?\" The answer which immediately comes to mind is obviously too vague, and more of a riddle than an answer, but here goes anyway: \"Close to, but not exactly the last desperate act of a dying man, going off the deep end in the secretarial pool, drowning in massive corporate debt.\" Indeed, such a blanket statement could be grossly misleading and quite plainly wrong. Upon further reflection, perhaps wanting to revise my interpretation of the book altogether, I'm reminded of two basic bits of advice that any dedicated careerist may have heard repeated over the years: \"Don't take your work home with you.\" and \"Don't bring your personal problems to work.\" Okay. That was another tangential point of departure for the rational thought process of an eccentric individual who obviously enjoys analyzing a promising work of fiction. Trying again. The story is actually about a couple of federal investigators who endeavor to solve a stunningly serious, heinous, vexing and perplexing crime. This fact alone makes reading the book worthwhile. You can often tell from the first few pages that it's going to be a good novel from the rhythm and pace of the writing by an experienced investigative reporter and competent police detective. R. Royce was deeply concerned that his ten-year-old niece might have become overly shy, withdrawn, and introverted spending so much of her time in front of a computer. He thought she needed a healthy and beneficial opportunity to break out of her shell, so to speak. Just before the upcoming Fourth of July week-end, he drove his brother Lehman and his daughter Lou Ellen to the lake one day to see if anyone was catching any fish. On the way, Lehman noticed that a fireworks stand was open for business and Royce stopped to let him buy some sparklers and firecrackers to liven up the outing a bit. All well and good. The two of them enjoyed the flashy, flaming noisemakers immensely, but Royce was not overly enthusiastic or satisfied by these less than impressive results. After they had their fun with the fireworks, the trio drove through the camp ground at the second spillway from the dam at the posted speed limit of 5 mph. Royce had an inspiration, then, wondering if the people they saw were sufficiently enjoying their vacations. He rolled down his window and got the attention of the first group of people they met, seated around a picnic table next to a smoking barbecuer. He began chatting with him for a moment. He discovered that the family lived in Tulsa and were camping at the lake for the holiday week-end. When they drove on further, he asked Lehman and Lou Ellen if they could tell whether the other people they saw along the way, were also on vacation, or not. His brother played along and said, \"I can't really tell at all. I think that you have to stop and ask them in person if you want to be absolutely certain whether they are on vacation or just out swimming for the afternoon.\" \"Let's see if we can find any happy campers,\" Royce said. He braked to a complete stop beside the very next campsite and suggested to Lou Ellen, \"Why don't you roll down your window and ask?\" Bravely, fearlessly, she rapidly rolled down the car window. She leaned out of the window and inquired of the first person she met who was standing nearby, \"Are you a happy camper?\" \"I am definitely a happy camper,\" the dashing young fellow replied, cheerfully and enthusiastically, a boy of her age and temperament, in his high-altitude jeans. \"My family and friends are going to be here for the long week-end. We've already been fishing and swimming. Later on, we're going water skiing. Our boat and trailer is over there by the picnic table. Mom is grilling frankfurters for lunch. Want a soda?\" The flood-gates had opened with his reply. \"No, thanks. Are you going to see the fireworks show tonight?\" she asked, hopefully. She had come out of her shell in no time at all. They had no need of great concern. The two of them were after all, cousins. She would meet several more at the family reunion, planned well in advance, especially for this auspicious occasion. Distant relatives would be arriving soon from Wichita.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes I hear about authors in roundabout ways. This time, the guy from my college who was helping me with my resume saw that I reviewed genre novels and told me I should read Jane Harper\u2019s thriller/mystery The Dry. I loved it so much that I almost immediately afterward went on to read Force of Nature: A Novel. It\u2019s every bit as good.The company of BaileyTennants sent a bunch of its employees on a kind of corporate retreat in the woods. The women took one trail, and the men took another. When the women arrive\u2013late and injured\u2013they\u2019re missing one of their number. Alice Russell has vanished. The group insists she left to move on in the middle of the night because she didn\u2019t want to wait until morning, but there\u2019s reason to believe that isn\u2019t the case. Federal Agent Aaron Falk and his partner Carmen Cooper were using Alice to get files and contracts implicating her bosses in money laundering, and more. On the night she disappeared, she tried to leave a voice mail for Aaron. While rescuers search the woods looking for Alice, Aaron and Carmen question everyone involved, trying not to give any hint to the employees that they are in fact already investigating the bosses. So the question is, did one or more of the ladies do something to Alice? Did the son of a serial killer who\u2019s rumored to live in the woods nearby kill her? Did someone else, like maybe the guy running the executive adventures company, do something? There\u2019s a lot of ill-will between the various women, leaving Aaron and Carmen with quite a few suspects.Force of Nature follows after The Dry. Aaron is still facing some of the fallout from what happened in that novel. I don\u2019t think you have to have read it first\u2013this is primarily about the mystery\u2013but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have that personal background for Aaron. Besides, The Dry is an excellent novel worth reading!The characters have a lot of depth to them. There\u2019s Jill, who didn\u2019t want to work for her father but when he insisted, she buckled down and got to work. Her brother is the CEO. We gradually discover that Alice isn\u2019t exactly going to be missed by a lot of people, with the exception of her teenaged daughter. Beth and Bree\u2013twins\u2013are about as different as night and day. Bree is Alice\u2019s assistant, and constantly trying to impress the woman. Beth is the troublemaker of the family, although not always in the ways you might expect. Lauren and Alice both went to the \u201cEndeavor Ladies\u2019 College\u201d together, which put some focus on learning to handle the out-of-doors, and their daughters have followed in their footsteps.The women find a mysterious, run-down cabin out in the woods, and they start to wonder whether it has any connection to a serial killer who hunted the area some years ago. He was caught, but everyone wonders if his missing son has picked up the family torch. We watch the women make their way through the woods in parallel to the unfolding investigation, and it\u2019s timed well. I never felt confused as to where or when I was.This is a really fascinating tale and I highly recommend it!Content note for death and injury of course.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a Jane Harper fan. This well-written book tells a story of a corporate retreat set in the outback of Australia. There are two parallel paths of narrative. The one traces chronologically the events of the three days of the retreat. The other is involved with the police effort to find and rescue a missing corporate officer who does not come back from the time in the bush. Harper maintain an atmospheric tension to both lines of the tale. Without many fleshed out details of the personalities engaged in the wilderness exercise or of the police who are searching and investigating, the author manages to make the reader care about the fate of the participants and their families. A good thriller you can zoom through in a weekend.",

                "reviewTitle": "Another gripping read from Jane Harper!",
                "reviewText": "I loved Jane Harper\u2019s debut novel, The Dry, when I read it a few years ago, so I\u2019m really pleased that I\u2019ve caught up on the second book in the series, Force of Nature. Aaron Falk is back, and this time, he is investigating the disappearance of a woman, Alice Russell, who has vanished while on a back packing trip with friends in the Australian outback. Aaron Falk has previously worked with Alice, who has worked with him on an investigation, so this adds a chilling note to Alice\u2019s disappearance, particularly as the investigation was to do with the company she works for. This is especially the case when we learn that one of Alice\u2019s last messages before she went missing was to Falk.I loved the tension Jane Harper creates surrounding Alice\u2019s disappearance. There is an immediate threat of danger, and you know from the outset, that the chances of the police finding Alice alive are very slim, especially given the terrain she has vanished in. But what happened to Alice? I really wanted to know, and I liked how Jane Harper went back in time, showing us what happened in the days preceding Alice\u2019s disappearance as the group of friends set off together.Jane Harper is a master at crafting landscapes in her novels, and she really captures the danger as the women set off. The way in which Jane describes the landscapes, making them feel so real in her writing, is what makes both of these two books unique. I\u2019m kicking myself that it\u2019s taken me this long to get round to reading Force of Nature. You get the sense that things can quickly change, away from the main towns and cities, and Jane Harper shows how experienced you need to be in exploring these routes. Falk and the police know how difficult their task is.Falk is a brilliant character, and his voice draws you into the story, keeping you captivated. He isn\u2019t a police detective; he is part of the financial investigation unit. From the moment when he is contacted by Alice Russell, when she leaves him a mysterious voice message, in the beginning of the book, you can sense the dread he is feeling. You can see that he is determined to find out what has happened to her.I thoroughly enjoyed Force of Nature. It is another gripping read from Jane Harper and I will make sure that I catch up on her other books as soon as possible.",

                "reviewText": "Jane Harper knows how to write and this second book after The Dry is a decent book. The stage is once more the Australian bush, the wilderness of this enormous continent. The writer uses the forces of nature to explore the depth of the human soul. She partially succeeds, but the story is long, elaborate and a bit oppressive: it could have been shorter. The usual trick of dedicating one chapter to the present and the following to the past is effective to a certain extent and soon becomes tedious. I agree with others that The Dry is better, but capturing the readers\u2019 attention throughout several books on similar subjects is very difficult\u2026",
