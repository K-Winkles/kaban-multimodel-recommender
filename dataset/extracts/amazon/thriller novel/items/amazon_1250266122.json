I have never annotated, talked out loud, dropped my jaw so many times while reading a book as I did with this one.The author is incredible at writing, and all of the little plot twists and things that make you wonder just make this book an amazing piece of work.",

While it had a good twist at the end and the different perspectives from Adam and Amelia helped tell the story, it didn\u2019t grab my attention (all the way through) like most books do.I\u2019m sure that my review will not be the norm, but I didn\u2019t care for all of the figurative language. I felt like every other sentence held a life lesson and it hurt the story. Sometime less is more. Do I think it would make a great screenplay/movie, absolutely, but I found myself skimming, scanning and sometimes skipping paragraphs just to get to the story and the end.I will admit that by the end I was just relieved that it was over. And the last chapter was just unnecessary.My version came with an excerpt of Daisy Darker so I will be reading more of Alice Feeney.",

The worn-out phrase 'couldn't put it down' has never rung truer than with this novel. While the initial chapters unsettled me with an eerie vibe, I persevered, and I'm ecstatic that I did. The author skillfully weaves a tale filled with expertly positioned twists that unfold seamlessly, never feeling contrived. This riveting narrative keeps you on your toes, maintaining an air of suspense that lasts until the very last page.",

                "reviewText": "Rock Paper Scissors is the fourth novel by Alice Feeney, and it\u2019s the second one that I\u2019ve read. I was hooked by the intriguing premise: a couple in a troubled marriage who win a weekend getaway to a remote chapel in the Scottish Highlands. What could possibly go wrong?The story alternates between the present, where Adam and Amelia Wright are trapped in the chapel by a snowstorm, and the past, where we learn about their relationship through letters that \"the wife\" wrote to Adam every year on their anniversary. The letters reveal secrets, lies, and betrayals that have shaped their marriage, and they also hint at a shocking twist that will change everything.Feeney is a master of suspense and deception. She creates a claustrophobic and creepy atmosphere that makes you feel like you\u2019re in the chapel with the characters. She also keeps you guessing with unexpected revelations and twists that make you question everything you thought you knew. The ending was just perfect: it was properly satisfying and very cleaver.I highly recommend it to fans of Feeney\u2019s previous books, and to anyone who loves a good mystery. Such a brilliant read to kick off 2024!",
