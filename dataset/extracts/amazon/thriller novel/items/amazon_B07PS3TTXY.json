There\u2019s murder, attempted murders, and fast-action mayhem. But there\u2019s no real conclusion.",

I didn't even realize that I was almost finished reading the entire series because I was into the characters and finding out how each character ties together.I enjoy MS. Cole's writing style, it is easy to follow. Also there aren't so many details that they take away from the book. In my opinion, you could read the books out if order and not be lost with the characters and what is going on in thebook.There is a seamless flow from book one until the last book in the series. I only have one more book in the series, I'm not ready to be finished with this series.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first time I have read a novella by this author and I can say that it is only the beginning of many more. I was definitely surprised with this short story and have always been a fan of excellent writing in a short amount of pages.So, what do we have on these few pages? Pure horror to start and end with....In between the beginning and the end, this novella manages to grip at the reader's intrinsic hope for survival....at least for a couple of the main characters.The character development is excellent, the plot is multi-layered and for anyone seeking action in a novella, it is on every page....every single one.As my title suggests, there is a Nanny taking care of a young baby. The parents are more than wealthy...super wealthy to be exact and their home is the epitome of money. Toss in an absolutely gorgeous necklace which adds to the mystique and the reader is ready to gallop along with this author. What is up with Alexa and why won't she respond? Alexa, Alexa....where are you?And, thank goodness for training that we may have acquired early in our life. One never knows if (or when) it may come in handy....Most highly recommended and for multiple reasons. And, I will definitely read more by this author..",
