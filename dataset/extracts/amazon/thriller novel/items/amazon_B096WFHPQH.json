After all, we're talking about military members fighting in a post-apocalyptic world.Brendon O'Neil and the rest of his sixteen-man US Navy SEAL troop meet their match in a battle they didn't see coming. While some readers of the series may know the results, they won't know the details... until they read this story.I applaud the author for his ability to blend so many different elements that kept my heart pounding.",

I enjoyed the book, even if the fighting was a bit too long for my taste ( though I understand others enjoy it). The story was really well told and I felt for the main character by the end. I just wish I had waited to read it after book 6 as now in not sure I want to go back to the begining after being hooked into the middle. I think I will give time for this story to fade from my memory a bit and come back to Tide.",

His character was the main reason the Hunters were able to survive that mission and continue to battle to save the world.
