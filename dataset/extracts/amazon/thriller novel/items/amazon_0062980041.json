I love his writing style and the way he always includes gourmet food and cool alcoholic beverages in his books. I was hungry by the time I finished this! LolThis is an engaging account of a young bride who marries a very wealthy entrepreneur. Abigail convinces herself that the marriage is right for her, but admits that Bruce\u2019s money is appealing. During her bachelorette weekend, she has too much to drink and is seduced by a handsome stranger. Unable to tell Bruce what she\u2019s done, she proceeds to marry him and go on their honeymoon to a remote island in Maine. Shortly after she arrives at the island, she discovers that the man she had a one night stand with is also there. She starts to notice other strange coincidences and occurrences, but even when she tells her husband she\u2019s creeped out, he is not agreeable to leaving. From there, a nightmare begins to unfold...This was slightly predictable at times, but moved along at a nice pace. The circumstances were a little far fetched, but I didn\u2019t mind this. The ending was action packed! I would have included a little more on the outcome, but it was satisfying enough.",

                "reviewText": "This book was interesting. The beginning peaked my interest enough that I continued with the story. Abigail is probably the 1st FMC That I found myself neither rooting for nor hoping she'd win, I just genuinely wanted to see how it would all play out. The first half of the book was a slow build that I didn't mind. The mystery doesn't really start to unfold until the 50% and once things started rolling my this book had my attention. I saw a few of the plot twists i saw coming but they still got even though I knew there were about to hit. The ending was a bit of a bore but overall I didn't mind the read, it was engaging enough that I wanted to finish it but it wasn't a book I was in a rush to finish. 3.5 stars. I purchased Peter Swanson's Eight Perfect Murders, I still plan on reading it and based on that book I may read other books from him or scratch him off the list.",

Trying to focus on her marriage and future with her newlywed husband, Abigail spots the mysterious man from her girl's weekend. He's insistent that they have something special. How did he follow her to this luxurious and remote island? And why do strange things keep happening on there?This was another interesting read by Peter Swanson. I really enjoyed this book! I was gifted a physical copy of it by my bookstore manager and checked out a bit of the audiobook; The narrator was great! I flew through this book, looking forward to finding out answers to all my questions. Many of my predictions were correct, however there were a few that caught me off guard! If you're a psychological thriller fan, check this one out!",

I thought the main character's reaction was believable and that's the author did not change his story to suit the reader.Keep the excellent stories coming.",

It would have gotten 5 stars but the beginning was a bit slow but it certainly rectifies that about halfway in. Takes place in Massachusetts, New York, and Maine. The main character Abigail is engaged to be married to Bruce. At her Bachelorette weekend she has too much to drink and has a one night stand that she decides not to tell her fiance about. The wedding goes as planned with the \"incident\" kept a secret apart from her best friend Zoe knowing about it, or so we are led to believe. The honeymoon on Heart Pond Island off the coast of Maine (which there really is an island/pond called that in Maine FYI) once there honeymooning the sh*t hits the fan. From this point on this mystery quickly intensifies and presents non stop action and drama. I really liked it, I am glad I didn't fold during the \"almost too much information\" at the beginning. The beginning chapters, especially the ones about her previous relationships just held no foundation to the overall story except for the reader to know a lot more about Abigail. Regardless, quick read and kept my interest.",
