                "reviewText": "I didn\u2019t want to see this book end. It has everything from a merciless and corrupt sheriff you love to hate to a main character you love to love. Seven people (including a two-year-old girl) are heartlessly murdered in a run-down Southern home where in its prime days presidents and celebrities vacationed. Of course, we know the four Army Rangers accused of the crime, known as the Ninja Squad, didn\u2019t do it, despite tons of condemning evidence and witnesses. Come on, Army Rangers (they reminded me of the Navy Seals that got bin Laden) would not kill a toddler. But it\u2019s a page-turner, nevertheless. Major Jeremiah Cook, a war veteran with a bad leg, and his team of investigators are wonderfully developed\u2014and I hope this is not the last we hear of him. A sequel to The Summer House would be great\u2014especially if it has Cook and special agent Connie York working together again. In terms of the book\u2019s ending, I don\u2019t want to spoil things but it was hugely satisfying to see Sheriff Emma Williams get what she deserved. Her corrupt ties to a sleazy politician were predictable, but hey, that's not uncommon in a Patterson story. I really enjoyed this book.",

                "reviewText": "The Summer House by James PattersonThis book was what I would consider a generic version of James Patterson story telling. The story line moved quickly, the characters all held their own and I enjoyed the chapters being broken up into small clips which helped the book flow.There were characters that were strong enough that they could be used in a followup novel. It was an enjoyable and simple book that held me to the finish, wanting to know how it would all conclude.The one thing I found unnecessary was the repeated use of God's name in vain. It wasn't needed in order to carry the bad guy image storyline. I am uncertain why writers use this to emphasize subject matter, you would think they could come up with hundreds of alternative words aside from his and damn togetherIt is an okay novel that I would probably read again. Patterson is a great writer and it is hard to go wrong, this is just not one of his five star award winners",

All of the lead investigator's trips in Afghanistan - yeah right. Wouldn't happen. Weren't necessary. All of that information could have been \"uncovered\" in a more realistic manner without being in-person in Afghanistan. An entire county in Georgia under the thumb of one bad character? Everyone getting killed or going missing and that doesn't raise anyone's concerns other than the Army investigators? Skyping into court??? Then POOF - the Rangers are magically free???? Too many characters killed off - for what? That doesn't make good reading - just gore. It would have been better to develop the story of Tyler and DD. There was no real build up to a satisfying ending.",
