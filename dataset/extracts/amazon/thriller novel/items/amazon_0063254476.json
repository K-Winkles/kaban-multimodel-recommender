                "reviewText": "Book condition: The book arrived new as ordered. There were no miss prints or damage to the book.Book review: This is the second book I\u2019ve read by Taylor Adams and I am just as impressed as I was the first time around. This is one of those that I literally had to put down and take a break from because there was so much suspense and anticipation that I couldn\u2019t handle it! Just when you think things are about to be settled, you notice that the number of pages you still have left in the book and know it can\u2019t possibly be over quite yet. One thing Adams knows how to do is have you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what the hell could possibly happen next. I did see two of the big reveals coming, but when it came to the actual action side of it I was never quite sure what to expect. Some of the more violent or slightly gruesome scenes were a little hard to get through because it was so easy to imagine it happening to you, but they weren\u2019t so bloody and gory that you wanted to throw up. I did like that the author gave multiple point of views also because it made it easier to connect with the story and understand just how sick and twisted the villain was. There was quite a bit of sadness to this book as well on top of the action. I honestly couldn\u2019t even imagine what I would do if I was Darby and trying to process what was happening at the rest stop and what was happening in her personal life all at the same time. I will say I was getting a little too angry and hype in some of the final chapters, but I was pleased by the end of it. If you enjoyed his book The Last Word, then I have no doubt you\u2019ll enjoy this. Or if you are someone looking for a book full of action and suspense that\u2019ll have you hooked, I would highly recommend this novel. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve read so many great reviews of this book (and the plot intrigued me) so I gave it a second go with reading it. I\u2019m so pleased that I gave it a second chance! I love how descriptive the characters and snowy scenes were in this. This played out like a movie in my mind and with the twists \u2026I was on the edge of my seat! The action kept going and I was so invested in the main character- I was rooting for her hard. Great book to read for cold weather season, It was so delightfully thrillingly Wintery.

Months later I randomly remembered it and decided to give it a read since it's a kindle unlimited book and boy am I glad I did!! This book was chalk full of plot twists, action, and suspense! I love how the people were layered with depth making them feel more real than just characters on a page. And the main character Darby is certainly one to root for! As soon as I finished the book (which I read in one day, it was that good!) I decided to give the movie a try since they have it on Hulu. The movie could not even compare to how amazingly the book captured everything! Hours later and I'm still thinking about it truly. I even ordered a paperback of the book for my bookshelf in case I want to reread it again in the future (which I will for sure). Definitely read this book!!!",

I love that we get to see Darby transform and take charge (Don't want to give anything away) This book has so much suspense in it, you will not want to put it down. There are some parts that will make you squirm but trust me, you will want to keep reading. Incredible plot, amazing characters, and an all around great book!",
