                "reviewText": "Thirty-one-year-old Dora works as an \u201cescort\u201d as she calls it. She insists that she is safe in her job and that the woman she works for, Elspeth, keeps her that way. In the beginning, she lets us know that doing sex work isn\u2019t about the money for her and that being rich isn\u2019t that important to her. Being valued is. Dora says that \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d is a core skill of hers. Because she\u2019s so adamant about what she does and why, it seems as if she\u2019s a combination of naivete and overconfidence.When she\u2019s savagely beaten by a client, it scares her so much that she opts to take her friend Evan\u2019s proposal of marriage. After spending time with him, she finds he\u2019s kind and sweet. She thinks she can love him. But she's out of practice when it comes to having those kinds of feelings. She\u2019s known poverty, and Evan\u2019s independent wealth appeals to her, contradicting her earlier bluster that money isn\u2019t important to her. Dora states that we won\u2019t like her, but she also lets us know that what she is professing is her version of the truth. \u201cWe all trade sex for something,\u201d she says. Her bluster often feels as if she\u2019s protesting too much. At other times, it comes off as belonging to a hardened woman. Is Dora a credible narrator?Dora still believes she can handle anything that comes her way. When Evan needs to leave for a week to work in Hong Kong, Dora takes a job she can\u2019t refuse. It doesn\u2019t involve sex, just accompanying a client, Daniel, to a chateau where his friends will gather and she will play his girlfriend. She rationalizes that this is not \u201csex work.\u201dOnce there, Dora is introduced to Daniel's friends who are a mixed lot, and none of them make her feel comfortable. Then she\u2019s introduced to Jonathan who she\u2019s certain is the man who savagely beat her and told her to give up the sex work or the next time would be her last. When she begins to experience frightening physical ailments, she doubts her sanity and wonders what in heaven\u2019s name is happening to her. When she tries to escape, she can\u2019t. Now she knows she shouldn\u2019t have taken this job and these people \u201caren\u2019t quite right.\u201dThe twists and reversals happen with a speed that often tangles the brain. What exactly is this group of people and who is pulling the strings? When Dora\u2019s background comes to light, the layers of craziness multiply, and what we know gets tangled to the point of wondering about everyone involved.The final secret alluded to in the title comes down like a hammer. Parks takes us on an almost surreal ride while accompanying Dora. Often what Parks lays out seems to contradict what she\u2019s previously set up, and just as we believe one thing, Parks reverses course. She does this over and over until she lands a brilliant and unexpected ending.Adele Parks creates a world from the viewpoint of a complex woman who keeps the reader confused at times or judgmental at others. Some of the observations like \u201c...money is power, and I play the game,\u201d and \u201cI guess I am the epitome of inappropriate,\u201d are meant to establish Dora\u2019s attitude toward her work. Parks keeps us confused about her ... and on edge. Why does she do what she does? Is she self-destructive or brilliant? Only the ending will tell us and then let us breathe once more.Thank you to Adele Parks, Harlequin Trade Publishing, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book.",
