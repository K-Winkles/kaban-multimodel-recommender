It was an easy read and very easy to see what the author thought,in my opinion. Think this would make a great movie! now I'm a fan and can't wait to read his other works, just have to wait tell tomorrow to get one! I've listened and read over a 1000 horror and sifi books and this one will be one of my favorites even though there's no zombies in it, kind of? Just a great book and very much worth the money and time. I'll be looking for the movie hopefully one day!!",

                "reviewText": "This book really surprised me with how good it was. The characters were very distinct and believable. The way they reacted was spot on. I suspect the author did some research or has direct experience with things that may cause severe anxiety, because the little details of how the characters behaved under these conditions was perfect. Such as when Hannah is hiding in the break room and she struggles to control her breathing. She'd alternate between forgetting to breathe and taking in giant gulps of air. Anyone who has experienced severe anxiety for any reason likely knows how accurate this is.I also loved how creepy Bishop was. If you love eerie horror with tons of blood and gore, this is for you.That said, I'll get into the reason I took a star. The book could have used a slightly better line editor. The copyediting was flawless, but a few things could have been said better.For example: When we're reading from Tyler's perspective and he notices the fingernails at the base of the door, it says that the antennas had torn them off when trying to scratch through the door \"without even noticing.\" This is something that should have been said from the perspective of someone who saw it and would know such a detail. Hannah could have been the one to notice this and it would have worked better.There's also a line that reads, \"Joe climbed into his hot, sun-heated pickup.\" Obviously, this is a redundancy. I, personally, would have and replaced it with a comparison. Something like, \"Joe climbed into his sun-heated pickup and was immediately struck with the suffocating sensation of entering a sauna\u2014not that there had been time for such leisure since he began working at the Facility.\"There was a small handful of such phrases that just could have been improved with a good line editor. There is also a developmental problem toward the end. Why did Bishop kill herself but all the other antennas rampaged through the Facility when they were taken off the gas? This never really gets explained. Perhaps she had just had more of the pain than she could take over the years, since she had been used more, but this should have been explained.Still, these small oversights were not nearly so numerous or glaring as to distract from an excellent story. The ending was immensely satisfying and revealed interesting details. The author is undeniably talented and to say I enjoyed the book is an understatement. I strongly recommend Intercepts to all horror fans.",

Good and quick story telling leaving no gaps in the story. Highly recommended!!",

Enough to keep reading, but not a book that'll stay in my mind for more than a couple days.If you want something a bit calmer, a mild horror element, some gore, human experiment stuff, and not super long then this is for you.",

                "reviewText": "This book is unnerving. It\u2019s gross. It\u2019s scary. And it\u2019s pretty damn good!Intercepts tells the story of Joe, a supervisor at a top-secret government facility that performs experimentation on human test subjects. Kept in extreme sensory deprivation, these human guinea pigs are essentially tortured into having outer body experiences which help the government locate and thwart terrorists, war lords and various other criminals.Unfortunately for Joe, one of the \u201cantennas\u201d as the test subjects are called, figures out who Joe is and uses her out of body experience ability to find and terrorize his wife and daughter.It\u2019s been decades since I read a horror novel that truly deserves the classification \u201chorror\u201d as much as Intercepts does. As I am incredibly squeamish about torture and any kind of human experimentation or imprisonment, this book bothered me on a whole other level. Brilliantly written and well-paced, it hooks you from the very first page and keeps walloping you with believable, well-executed twists and turns until the end. For days afterward, I kept peeking around corners in my house half expecting to see \u201cBishop\u201d standing at the end of the hallway screaming at me. Payne also didn\u2019t give any of his characters truly happy endings so it ends by giving you a hard gut punch which I appreciated.Would I recommend this book? Absolutely yes!!!! If you love horror and a bit of blood and guts, go buy this book right now.",
