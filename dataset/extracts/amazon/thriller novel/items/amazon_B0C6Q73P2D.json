Frankie Elkin is an expert at finding the missing persons that the rest of the world has forgotten, but even she couldn\u2019t have anticipated this latest request\u2014to locate the long-lost sister of a female serial killer facing execution in three weeks\u2019 time. She has called herself \"death,\" but people called her the devil. The case was sensational. Kaylee Pierson had confessed from the very beginning, waived all appeals. Despite the media\u2019s chronicling of her tragic circumstances\u2014the childhood spent with a violent father\u2014no one could find sympathy for \u201cthe Beautiful Butcher\u201d who had led eighteen men home from bars before viciously slitting their throats. Now, with only twenty-one days left to live, Pierson has finally received a lead on the whereabouts of the sister who was kidnapped over a decade ago, and she needs Frankie\u2019s help to find her. The Beautiful Butcher\u2019s offer: When was the last time your search ended with finding the living? Unable to resist the chance for a rescue, Frankie takes on Pierson\u2019s request. Twelve years ago, five-year-old Leilani went missing in Hawaii. The main suspect? Pierson\u2019s tech mogul ex-boyfriend, Sanders MacManus. Now, on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific\u2014the site of MacManus\u2019s latest vanity project\u2014fresh evidence has appeared. In order to learn the truth and possibly save a young woman\u2019s life, Frankie must go undercover at the isolated base camp. Her challenge: A dozen strangers. Countless dangerous secrets. Zero means of calling for help. And then the storm rolls in\u2026 Read more",
