But after the chief of police himself tells her she can write her own ticket within the department, Ballard takes back her badge, leaving \u201cthe Late Show\u201d to rebuild and lead the cold case unit at the elite Robbery-Homicide Division.For years, Harry Bosch has been working a case that haunts him\u2014the murder of an entire family by a psychopath who still walks free. Ballard makes Bosch an offer: come volunteer as an investigator in her new Open-Unsolved Unit, and he can pursue his \u201cwhite whale\u201d with the resources of the LAPD behind him.First priority for Ballard is to clear the unsolved rape and murder of a sixteen-year-old girl. The decades-old case is essential to the councilman who supported re-forming the unit, and who could shutter it again\u2014the victim was his sister. When Ballard gets a \u201ccold hit\u201d connecting the killing to a similar crime, proving that a serial predator has been at work in the city for years, the political pressure has never been higher. To keep momentum going, she has to pull Bosch off his own investigation, the case that is the consummation of his lifelong mission.The two must put aside old resentments and new tensions to run to ground not one but two dangerous killers who have operated with brash impunity. In what may be his most gripping and profoundly moving book yet, Michael Connelly shows once again why he has been dubbed \u201cone of the greatest crime writers of all time\u201d (Ryan Steck, Crimereads).

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Bosch and Ballard join forces in a cold cases unit - but it's clear where Connelly's affections lay",
                "reviewText": "I realized about halfway through Desert Star that I've been reading books about Harry Bosch for more than 25 years at this point, and it's to Michael Connelly's credit that I still enjoy the newest ones as much as ever, and that somehow, he's largely avoided falling into the kind of ruts that you would think would be an issue with that. No small part of that boils down to the way that Connelly has let Bosch age and the world evolve, to the point that, when Desert Star begins, Harry has been enlisted to help with a cold cases unit run by Ren\u00e9e Ballard, Bosch's friend (and sort of protege, though neither might admit that). In theory, Desert Star is the story of Bosch's efforts to get justice for a murdered family whose case stalled out, but that's almost a bait and switch, as the politically necessary case of discovering the murderer of a councilman's young sister comes to take up the majority of the book. This is now the fourth book where Bosch and Ballard have been allowed to co-star, so to speak, and Connelly has found the necessary rhythms pretty nicely, letting the two trade beats back and forth, allowing Bosch to still be the prickly loner that he always has been while finding in Ballard someone who marries Bosch's desire to find justice with someone who also knows how to live within the system. That doesn't keep Bosch from still being Connelly's real love here, and that's okay; while the plot of the book makes it clear that Connelly knows that Bosch's time needs to come to a close soon, it's hard to begrudge him spending time with a character who we've known for this long (more than a quarter century!). If all of this sounds like I'm talking a bit more about the big structure of the book than the plotting, don't let that sound like I'm dodging the subject; suffice to say, Desert Star is typically interesting and well-paced Connelly plotting, with a couple of great reveals and some nice beats that allow the characters to breathe and the world to still spin outside them. (There's a brief moment with Bosch in a bar towards the end of the book that's about as good of a chapter as Connelly ever wrote, all the more because of how simple it is.) Connelly still sometimes has a tendency to go for the big theatrical showdown and climax, but heck, that's part of what makes the books fun. I haven't read a bad Connelly in many years, and Desert Star keeps that streak alive, giving you an enjoyable mystery and, more importantly, a chance to hang out in Connelly's rich, observed world.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars End of the Line for Harry Bosch?",
                "reviewText": "Harry Bosch is getting old. To be precise, he is 72 years old in 2022, when the events in Desert Star take place. His motto has always been, \u201cEverybody counts or nobody counts. This is the driving force in his pursuit of justice for victims. But how long can he keep going?That\u2019s the question I had in mind when I cracked open the latest installment in Michael Connelly\u2019s long-running series of crime novels featuring Bosch. Connelly debuted the character in 1992\u2019s The Black Echo, I discovered the Bosch series in 2015, and I have been a huge fan ever since. (The television show is also very good.)With Bosch, Connelly has created a Los Angeles-centric universe of characters who interact with one another, such as Mickey Haller (the \u201cLincoln lawyer\u201d and Bosch\u2019s half-brother) and Renee Ballard (Bosh\u2019s erstwhile partner). As Bosch ages, Connelly is able to shift the focus from him to these other characters. Because fans are already invested in them, they find it\u2014I find it\u2014easy to pick up the new books.This is especially true as some of the protagonists in my other favorite series age. Jack Reacher is too old to be homeless in America. Walt Longmire\u2014who\u2019s older than Bosch\u2014is too old to be running around the Rez. And Gabriel Allon\u2014who\u2019s contemporary to Bosch\u2014has retired from Mossad. What do you do with these beloved characters?Connelly has solved that problem by moving Bosch into a secondary position as a supporting character to LAPD Detective Renee Ballard. In Desert Star, she runs the reconstituted Open-Unsolved Unit that tries to close cold cases. With Bosch as her first choice, she has created a volunteer group to sift through cold cases and use DNA or other new developments solve old murders. The team includes another retired (but lazy) LAPD officer, a retired deputy DA, a retired FBI agent, and an investigative genetic genealogist with a penchant for the psychic realm.Desert Star focuses on two cases. The first is the 1994 murder of Sarah Pearlman, sister of LA City Councilman Jake Pearlman, who has been instrumental in restarting the Open-Unsolved Unit, and who expects his sister\u2019s case to be prioritized.The second is the Gallagher Family case, the 2013 murder of Dad, Mom, and two kids. Bosch worked the case and identified a suspect, Finbar McShane, but the case went cold long before he retired. It\u2019s the one that got away.Connelly\u2019s plot is a slow burn, with the major action reserved for near the end of the book. It\u2019s a classic police procedural. The plot twists and turns as new evidence and new insights about old evidence lead readers to the book\u2019s denouement, which hits close to home.Bosch has often been in perilous, even life-threatening situations, but this is the first time I genuinely worried for him in the years I\u2019ve been reading the series. Is this the end of the line for Harry Bosch? You\u2019ll have to read the book for yourself to find out.Whether or not it is, however, I\u2019m glad that Connelly had the foresight to introduce Renee Ballard in the Bosch literary universe several years ago. She\u2019ll carry on when Harry can\u2019t. I enjoyed Desert Star, and I\u2019m looking forward to the next novel.",
