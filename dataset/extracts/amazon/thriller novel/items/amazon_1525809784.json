I think the fact that Regina bought into the plan because Thursday had an affair with her husband isn't convincing. That Hannah pretended she didn't know Thursday is just plan odd. And that Thursday (who names a child Thursday?!) is delusional to the degree portrayed in the novel and nobody realized it is just unconvincing. Why would an ex-wife, a current wife, and the current wife's husband work together to drive Thursday crazy? It just doesn't work for me.",

                "reviewText": "Talk about whiplash! I feel as if I was just thrown back about 50 feet with the abrupt ending in the denouement of this wildly inventive and intense story of trauma, abuse, and manipulation.Initially, I thought I recognized the shape of this story. I was prepared for an intimate perspective of a rebellious wife in a plural marriage. I imagined the result of her rebellion and looked forward to reading about the ultimate liberation of the first person narrator, who is the middle wife awakening from her complete and total devotion to, infatuation of, and fog of lust for her husband.I was repulsed yet intrigued with this character revealing her complete loss of personal definition of self beyond her identity as a woman sharing intimacy with a man who needed more than one woman to devote most of herself, if not all of herself, to him. While listening to her character develop through the early plot points, she became for me less and less of a reliable narrator and this is when the real fun begins. From this point forward my head was spinning in a dizzy of the psychological pathologies I thoughtI glimpsed in every character of this twisted tale of \"gaslighting \"and manipulation. Only to find that my guess was half right or entirely wrong.Readers...this one is heart breaking, but instructive. This woman gains invaluable insight into her self as she unravels this careful construct of her personae rooted in her \"love\" for her husband and complete disabusement of an authentic personhood rooted in her own unique and separate self.When traumatized enough, isolated enough, damaged enough, we all are susceptible to manipulation by a grifter, sheister, cult-leader, fraudster, public figure (uh...hum) or cold-hearted lothrio. So much so, there is a dissociation from the reality of anything existing outside the perimeter or anything that may be threatening to the construct shaped by the manipulator in the psyche of their intended target In other words, a \"cognitive dissonance\".Okay here it comes...I wonder if there is a current observable phenomenon in our society that served as a bit of inspiration for the idea that one can surrender their identity and immerse themselves so completely in the fictitious, false and completely self-serving version of events and reality created by a predator posing as a good person or lover... in the public provenance, they are often referred to as...charlatans.How does someone break free from this prison of the heart where the mind follows and dear Lord...what happens after? This is the \"juicy part\" and sheer brilliance of the read.Oh but that last part...for who I know myself to be... I am ashamed to say I enjoyed it a little too much. Perhaps it is the effect of the times we live in or the frustrations of this day that let my inner demons out to play.I was vastly entertained, yet, duly forewarned.How brilliant!",

Tuesday, the main character, (seriously who names their kid that) is a little out there , then she's the most wonderful sane person who's been unfairly deemed to be severely mentally ill and then the very ending, a total switch-up yeah . After all the time invested to make her appear to be very sane and logical it all came apart. I did appreciate the highlighting of the trials of mental illness but seemed stupid to switch it up at the very end.

                "reviewText": "What can I say about The Wives ? Other than, it is I-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E! It\u2019s genuinely one of the best books that I have ever read! The Wives, follows the protagonist Thursday as she navigates life as the wife of a polygamist. There are three wives in total & Thursday sees Seth ( her Hubbie ) every Thursday & his other wives get Monday & Tuesday. Tuesday is the original wife & Monday is the newest wife, all of them are aware of each other & have agreed to never try to get information about each other & instead live life as normal.Seemingly, Thursday is accepting of her lot until one day she discovers a hospital receipt in her husbands pocket. Closer inspection of the receipt shows that Monday is actually called Hannah & she is pregnant. Armed with the receipt & some basic computer skills Thursday starts to investigate her fellow wife. As she continues to look for info on Hannah, she starts to unravel & become obsessed with finding out as much as she can about her husbands other wives.First off, Thursday is a very complex, but very endearing protagonist who you really empathise with & want to succeed, especially when the reader discovers that Thursday is psychologically traumatised from an incident earlier in her marriage to Seth. Secondly, as the story progresses & layer after layer of secrets & lies are revealed, the story becomes increasingly more unsettling, dark & twisted. As the plot gets more & more twisty, all your initial preconceptions start to crumble.I loved the pacey, relentless and all consuming plot points, which is why I binge read it at every opportunity!Of course I now have a major book-hangover but it\u2019s worth it! I have nothing negative at all to say about this book, which is an endorsement of how clever & compelling this book is. I would definitely read more from this author & highly recommend reading this book, because for once the hype is real!! If you enjoy a domestic thriller guys, then you have to read this novel ASAP because it\u2019s genius ! This was an easy 5* star rating for me ! ! I would give it more if I could !",
