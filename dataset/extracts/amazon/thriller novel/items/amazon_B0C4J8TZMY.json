She hears a noise\u2014old houses are always making some kind of noise. But this sound is disturbingly familiar: it\u2019s the tread of footsteps, unusually heavy and slow, coming up the stairs.She sees the figure of a man appear down the hallway, shrouded in the shadows. Terrified, she quietly wakes her children and hustles them into the oldest part of the house, a tiny, secret room concealed behind a wall. There they hide as the man searches for them, trying to tempt the children out with promises and scare the mother into surrender.In the suffocating darkness, the mother struggles to remain calm, to plan. Should she search for a weapon or attempt escape? But then she catches another glimpse of him. That face. That voice. And at once she knows her situation is even more dire than she\u2019d feared, because she knows exactly who he is\u2014and what he wants.",

                "reviewText": "Excuse me for a moment while I take the time for my heart to return to its normal speed...Whew! I read this book way, way late into the night last night because everything about it is so tense and scary that I couldn't put it down. Even the middle, which was not so much of a heart-pounding thriller as it was an eerie, menacing tale, had my interest because I just wasn't sure what was going on.In a nutshell, it's the story of a woman, alone with her two young children in a fairly isolated house in the middle of an intense blizzard. When she goes to check on her son, she hears a creak on the stairs and discovers there is a strange man in her home. What happens next is a claustrophobic, very frightening tale of a mother's drive to survive in the midst of unimaginable circumstances. She ruminates on all that has happened to lead up to this moment, which creates a feeling of uncertain unease.The middle's rumination does detract a bit from the story, but I did need a little time to breathe. It helps to create some layers to the story which focus a lot on misogyny and its various forms. So much of it made me so angry and frustrated that these things could happen. But the writing is so good you wonder--is she an unreliable narrator? Is she telling the truth and no one believes her?I liked the ending, because pretty much everything is tied up and resolved with all questions answered, however some of it felt a bit like an info dump. It might have been better had more of it happened \"on screen\" but I'm not sure my rapidly beating heart could have survived.Overall, this is a taut thriller told in a really unique style and manner. Be prepared to stay up late to finish.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",

                "reviewText": "Nightwatching by Tracy Sierra is a highly recommended domestic horror novel that morphs into a psychological thriller.There is a blizzard outside and a mother is at home alone with her two children, ages 8 and 5, when she hears something and knows that someone is in the house. She happens to be in the shadows of the hall by her son's room when she seems the huge, tall man come up the stairs, hesitate, and then head in the opposite direction, to her room. She wakes the children with admonishments to make no noise and they quickly creep downstairs to hide in the hidden, tiny secret space concealed behind a wall. They can hear the man searching for them, while talking to them out loud and taunting them. The mother has one goal now - she must save her children.While the tension is almost unbearable during the current situation, the narrative has flashbacks to previous events in the protagonists life. Readers will realize her husband is missing on this night and will also learn about earlier events in her life. The novel is written in a third person limited point-of-view, which works well in this case. The descriptions within the settings are very well-written and bring the struggles and challenges facing her to life.The characters are unnamed in this debut novel, which would not be my preference in a novel, but it is handled adeptly. Everything we know is filtered through the unnamed mother's perspective and we are only following her thoughts and observations. To be honest, the frequent mentions of how tiny, small, and petite the protagonist is does become a tad bit annoying at a certain point as does her hesitation to stand up for herself.The first part of Nightwatching is definitely written as a horror novel and then the novel transforms to more closely resemble a psychological thriller. The final denouement is very satisfying and makes up for some of the earlier doubts and questions about the plot that arose while I was reading. Thanks to Penguin Viking/Pamela Dorman Books for providing me with an advance reader's copy via NetGalley. My review is voluntary and expresses my honest opinion.",
