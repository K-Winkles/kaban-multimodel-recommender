                "reviewText": "Wow wow wow! This book was great!I do have to first quickly get out of the way the fact that in the beginning of this book, the multiple POV\u2019s (7 of them to be exact!) was really throwing me off in the beginning. I was getting introduced to character after character after character, whose POV\u2019s were all CRUCIAL to the story, and I was having a really hard time keeping TWO different couples, AND everyone else\u2019s story straight.I had to go through 7 brand new POV\u2019s (the first 7 chapters) before it FINALLY circled back to a character that I was familiar with.And because of that, I literally almost DNF\u2019d this book after completing the first 7 chapters. (Which I have NEVER done!) but I was getting really confused and frustrated.But because I\u2019m stubborn and hate to DNF (and was still already invested in the story by this point, even though I was scrambling to put pieces together) I was thankfully reminded WHY I hate to DNF, which is that I always think to myself \u201cbut what if the story gets better from here and I end up being glad I continued?\u201d and \u201cwell now I can\u2019t live with myself if I don\u2019t find out what happens!\u201dI am definitely glad that I stuck to it and finished this book! YES, there were still a lot of POV\u2018s and a lot of moving parts in this story, but I think that ended up being part of the reason why it was so engaging and fascinating. Practically all I read is thrillers and horror, and sometimes the books start to all blend together when you\u2019re reading the same kind of thing constantly.But this book definitely stands out! I think this was literally the twistiest thriller I\u2019ve ever read! It was such a freakin ride, and we are constantly getting a piece of the puzzle revealed. I don\u2019t think there was a dull moment in this book (even during the parts in the beginning when I was confused \ud83e\udd23)I honestly think it\u2019s gonna be hard to find a thriller that tops this one now. I am going to have to go and see if I can find more by this author.I definitely 100% recommend this book to anyone who comes across it! Especially if you\u2019re in a reading slump! This book will definitely get your heart pounding, and your critical thinking and murder-solving skills turning again!",

                "reviewText": "This is a very difficult book to review as I have mixed feelings. I like the style of writing. The author alternates the chapters between the Maids Diary, the main characters prior to the murder and the investigators and lead characters post murder. The author does a great job developing the characters and setting the scene. The main characters are the Maid \u2013 Kit, Daisy and Jon Rittenberg, Vanessa and Haruto North, the investigators \u2013 Mal and Benoit and Kits friend Boon. Jon is an ex-gold medal winning Olympic skier and his wife Daisy is from a very wealthy and prominent family in the area.The story begins with \u201cHow it Ends - Slowly, she slides she slides between sleep and consciousness\u201d\u2026 This is the murder. The novel then goes into detail of the night of the murder by a neighbor witness and from the perspective of a couple in the midst of a scandalous sexual affair at the sight of the body dumping; they are political figures and cannot report what they have seen because it would expose their affair.When the authorities arrive at the scene of the bloody crime they notice a pie smashed and oozing out of its box on the steps of the house with a note from a friend. It doesn\u2019t take the investigators long to determine it was from a friend of the house owners (Vanessa and Haruto North) Daisy and Jon Rittenberg. We then learn a lot about those main characters. We learn the Jon has a very sordid past that Daisy has helped stay hidden. The story is leading us to believe Jon and or Daisy may be involved with the Murder since the only eyewitness (that speaks to the police) states that one of the people at the scene appeared to be a man and the other a larger (round) person and Daisy is pregnant.I think this is a good suspenseful novel with a good twist at the end, however the alternating timelines (some undated) can be a little confusing.MINOR SPOILERS:The neighbor who reported the crime never saw the body but rather a large rug being lugged out to a vehicle; a vehicle that matches the Rittenbergs. The maids car was also at the scene. However, we learn that the North\u2019s are not who we thought they are. The North\u2019s are confirmed as vacationing out of the country and have been for some time. We now know that the friend of Daisy is a poser living in the North\u2019s house. Meanwhile, another side story is Daisy\u2019s paranoia surrounding ominous and threatening messages she is receiving regarding her unborn baby. They are very personalized and refer to things only people from her past would know about. She is obsessed with who this mysterious person could be and tries tracking down people from her and Jon\u2019s past. She has no idea that that person is related to the main story. The Maid who is the protagonist is quirky in her own right. She loves pretending to be someone she is not and posting social media about a fabulous life that is not hers. She loves snooping in her clients house and learning of their secrets. She is the maid at the Norths and also starts serving at the Rittenbergs. At the Rittenberg\u2019s she realizes it is Jon\u2019s house and her past comes screaming back to her. She is part of the Rittenbergs past.MAJOR SPOILERS:Although we shift our victim(s) from the Norths to the Main; we eventually learn it is no one. We learn that Kit is playing the Rittenbergs and acting as both Kit Vanessa and Mia and has been orchestrating the entire \u201cFake murder\u201d to set up the Rittenbergs. However, due to the encounter and the devasting effects she has had on Jon\u2019s life we are led to believe that he actually did murder her\u2026My biggest issue with this book is the timelines\u2026 I love twists and I love how many authors lead you down a path but in this case I feel the book is written in a way that you cannot put pieces together. For example: On page 302 (Kindle version) the author writes:Kit says: \u201cFull disclosure\u201d, she says as she sets her glass carefully on a small table at her side. \"I only became Mia after I saw whatDaisy had locked in her safe. It really was a point of no return, seeing that recorded footage-that proof of what happened that night at the ski lodge party. This is not true. John meets Kit as \u201cMia\u201d on page 76 while John is having food and drinks with Henry on 10/17/19 and Kit doesn\u2019t discover the evidence until page 168 during the Maids Diary (undated). So since the diary is undated it could be accurate but it seems to be misleading.",
