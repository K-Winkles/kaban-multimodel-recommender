                "reviewText": "For people who have seen the Netflix movie version of this - which was excellent - you won't be disappointed in the novel. I don't read a lot of novels, but after watching the movie, I had to get this one. It's worthy of the same praise the film is getting. The writing is sparse where it has to be, yet filled with the details that often get lost in a movie. It's easy to read because it's so well-written. One of the themes that really interested me was just how anxious and worried people are in our time. It takes a while to really figure out what's going on here, but when we do, it's not really a surprise. Perhaps the worst we can imagine is just ahead.",

Of course I wanted more, but should have known the way future details were written in as Easter eggs that they were all I was getting.Honestly, the first 1/4 of the book ticked me off (too many inner dialogues, too many focuses on body parts, pointless story so far?). But it picked up, and by halfway I was in it for good. And it did get good. I only wanted to smack one of the adults by the end, not all 4.Lots to think about.

                "reviewText": "Clay and Amanda go on a family vacation with their children to a beautiful cabin far from everything and everyone... Nothing new there... One night, the owners of that house, Ruth and George, show up at the front door. There's been some sort of blackout and they had no idea where to go, except their own house... That, right there, it's the recipe for a fabulous horror / scary book... But no, it disappoints...I absolutely loved the beginning and all the details the author gives the reader: the smells, the sounds, the little movements... It's all those little things that made the situation and the characters feel alive, at least to me! And I felt right there, next to them. The story keeps getting interesting, you start wondering what's going on and if Ruth and George are truly the owners of the house....And slowly, the rhythm starts decaying. It's interesting to witness the characters getting to know each other and try to figure out what's happening in the real world, but it comes to a point when it feels the story is stuck in the same dynamics. It's pretty clear that they all feel like time is going slower, like everything gets weird and they enter this weird numbness... But it feels repetitive to me, even boring at moments...Yes, there are great phrases all around, reflections about relationships, parenthood, even a bit of racism... The topics and the situation are all perfect to create a better drama, or a nice thriller... But it kinda gets stuck in the way, in my opinion. I kept going with the audiobook thanks to the fabulous narration of Marin Ireland. She absolutely nails all the inflections for every character, the dramatic charge of the dialogues, their doubt, fears and anguish... She was amazing!It inevitably reminded me of Paul G. Tremblay's \"The Cabin At The End Of The World\" and its film adaptation, the whole \"end of the world\" idea, the emergency system, the urgency... And its weird ending, as well... I feel there's a common denominator there, and not many options to finish a story like this... Some people loved it, some felt disappointed (like me), I guess I was expecting a lot after its interesting beginning and a great writing... But it was entertaining, after all.",

                "reviewText": "Review of Leave the World Behind, 2023The book seems to be a recasting of \u201cThe Next Voice You Hear,\u201d the 1950 movie starting James Whitmore (1921-2009) and a pre-First Lady Nancy Davis Reagan (1921-2016). As in the 1950 film, the reader is never told what happened to force the end of humanity. There is too much implicit and explicit sexuality in the book as if the only purpose of humanity is animal sexuality. This is not a spiritual lifting book like the 1950 film where the \u201cVoice\u201d heard throughout the world on all radio and television channels is in the native language of the listener \u2013 except for Whitmore \u2013 who hears nothing for technical reasons. The reasons he cannot hear God is because of external factors: the radio is broken, television has a bad tube, etc.In the film, everyone knows what is coming \u2013 except for Whitmore. He only hears God\u2019s Pronouncements second-hand from other humans. In the Alam book, God is dismissed as a useless superstition of less enlightened humans.It is not a fun book to read for happy endings.Two notable quotes about President Barack Hussein Obama II are in the book \u2013 which was made into a 2023 movie produced by President Obama.\u201cThat was something he\u2019d disliked in Obama; the nebulous almost religious promise. He (G.H. protagonist) preferred a plan.\u201d Page 178 in e-Book.\u201cSo he didn\u2019t like Obama, either. It had to do only with the presumption of it. The fist bumping, the joviality. It insulted him, a mockery of the world as he understood it.\u201d Page 227 in e-Book.Basically, the book is an \u201celevator story\u201d story line used in many television shows and movies when funding is low. This is not to be confused with the Elevator Pitch used for sales presentations. This is a \u201cremote house\u201d storyline where the actors are trapped for unknown reasons in their situation.Dr. Ali Fant, WB5WAF",

Throughout the book, the author builds a feeling of menace which at first the reader might believe is just in the characters' imaginations but which gradually becomes real.This is also a book about being a parent, especially a father as the fathers in the story struggle with helplessness and despair. Not to mention their own fear.Very much recommended.",
