                "reviewText": "I love Allison Brennan's Don\u2019t Open the Door, the second book in her Regan Merritt series, it kept me on the edge of my seat and up many late nights reading. Allison Brennan has once again proven that she is an amazing storyteller. Former U.S. Marshall Regan Merritt returns to Washington, DC following the murder of her former boss, Tommy Granger. Regan discovers that Tommy took a leave from the U.S. Marshalls and was looking into the murder of Regan\u2019s ten-year-old son, Chase Warwick less than a year ago. I love how Allison Brennan incorporated the title of the book into the story. Tommy called Regan prior to his death, leaving her a voicemail because of the time difference between Washington and Arizona. He let her know that he was going to talk to his boss later that morning about his findings on the case. Unfortunately, Tommy was executed as he left his house and his phone and his files pertaining to the investigation were taken by the murderer and never talked to his boss, Charlie North. Regan begins retracing Tommy\u2019s final days and investigates his cell phone records. Regan\u2019s ex-husband, Grant Warwick, a corporate lawyer, initially blamed Regan\u2019s job as a U.S. Marshall as the reason behind Chase\u2019s death. The man who shot Chase, Adam Hannigan, was the brother of a bank robber that Regan killed during a bank robbery. The shooter was murdered in jail, so the F.B. I. closed the case. During her investigation, Regan learns that was not the case. As she continues to investigate with Charlie\u2019s assistance, a mole is discovered within the F.B.I, and Grant\u2019s life is in danger. Grant discovers that his live-in girlfriend was murdered in their home. Grant is the prime suspect in her death. I love how Regan and Charlie connect all the incidents together and hope to find the killer before he or she gets away or kills Regan and Grant. I love all the details that Regan discovered without the use of Tommy\u2019s notes. I love how Regan and Charlie find the answers behind Chase\u2019s death and how Regan and Grant finally get closure for what happened to Chase. Regan and Grant\u2019s relationship was shattered because of Chase\u2019s death, and through the investigation they began to mend their relationship. It took me by surprise who was behind Chase\u2019s murder, and how intricate all the details were. Like all of Allison Brennan's, Don\u2019t Open the Door is filled with incredible characters, thrilling plot twists and unexpected turns of events. I really love everything about Don\u2019t Open the Door. Allison Brennan continues to amaze me with her writing and to deliver incredible thrillers.",

                "reviewText": "Regan is a unique character. I recommend reading book one before book two as it gave a lot of details regarding Regan, her loss, the ex husband, friendship and former job. This book picks up a few months after book one ends with the death of her former mentor and good friend who was looking into the murder of her child. She quickly finds out that not everything is as it seems and the murder was just the tip of the ice burg. We meet her ex husband and her former supervisor. The story has a lot of details and twists to get to the truth of what happened and why. There are some great snarky moments and deep secondary characters The ending does address and solve her child\u2019s murder, so I do wonder if we will see Regan again, back in Flagstaff with her dad, as she works towards her future or if this was just a duology.",

                "reviewText": "I love Regan Merritt\u2019s tenacity and boldness, but mostly I love how real she is. This is the second book in the series but can definitely be read as a standalone. Regan thought the worst pain she could ever endure was when her ten year old son Chase was murdered. But she finds out that there is pain that is equally hard to endure when a close friend and mentor is killed and she is determined to follow the clues no matter where they may lead. All of the characters are relatable and realistic although not all of them are likable. The villains are definitely not on my \u201cI would like to meet this guy\u201d list unless I have Regan backing me up with her Glock. The pace is fast and maintained my interest from beginning to end. There are some real unexpected twists here that I did not see coming and I really enjoyed them. I liked finding out more about Regan\u2019s current situation and her quest to find peace with her past. The mystery is real, the red herrings are numerous and this is a well-written whodunit that had me on the edge of my seat. Loved it and look forward to seeing Regan in future books!DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.
