                "reviewText": "NO STRANGERS HERE (County Kerry Mystery Book #1) by Carlene O\u2019Connor is an intricately plotted and captivating murder mystery/police procedural set in County Kerry, Ireland. This is the first book in a new series from a new-to-me author that kept me completely immersed in the story.Detective Inspector Cormac O\u2019Brien is dispatched from Killarney to head the murder investigation of a prominent and wealthy landowner, Jimmy O\u2019Reilly. In Dingle, everyone knows something about everyone and there are secrets that have been kept for decades. DI O\u2019Brien is determined to unearth all of them to catch a murderer.Veterinarian Dimpna Wilde has lost everything she built in Dublin through no fault of her own. Even though she has not been home to Dingle in decades, she returns home to decide what she will do with her life now. She is shocked when she returns to find her family are the prime suspects in the O\u2019Reilly murder. Dimpna is determined to clear her family members, but her return is digging up secrets from her own past and the terrible secrets that made her leave Dingle. Besides dealing with old friends and enemies, she has a very astute DI uncovering dark secrets right along with her.This is a fantastic murder mystery story with realistic characters, a twisted plot with not only a murder, but also decades of secrets filled with lies, theft, extortion, greed and sexual assault all set in the scenic and beautiful coastal tourist town of Dingle in Ireland. Ms. O\u2019Connor brought it all to life for me while I was also trying to uncover the clues to a murderer. The plot weaves effortlessly between the present and Dimpna\u2019s revelations throughout the story of her past and her present with plenty of plot twists and red herrings that continually had me guessing. I am anxiously looking forward to the next book in this series to see how all the characters land and go forward since the resolution of this murder case.I highly recommend this exceptional murder mystery/police procedural set in Ireland and I am very glad it is going to be a series!",

                "reviewText": "I have enjoyed the Constable Siobhan series of cozy mysteries by Carlene, even though I don't prefer cozies. The new series of more intense and serious mysteries is very different. I have mixed feelings about this book and it is a bit of a mess. It starts with a murder but the first half of the book puts the murder on the back burner and focuses on the veterinarians and their family and friends, who have tangled relationships. These characters are good and well fleshed-out but I found myself wanting to get on with the murder investigation which was rather weak. The character of DI Cormac was not very well developed and he remains a mystery. There were lots of suspects and many links to past events here. There was a rich family that you will love to hate. I am not sure whether I will continue with this series",

She also makes me want to travel to Ireland to visit the locations of her novels.Dingle in Country Kerry appears to be a beautiful town on the Atlantic that is attractive to locals and tourists alike. It isn\u2019t a town where you would expect the super rich and powerful local racehorse owner, Johnny O\u2019Reilly, to be murdered.Local vet Eamon Wilde is the main suspect because the cause of death appeared to be a poison used by vets. What was his motive? And Eamon Wilde was suffering from early dementia. His daughter Dimpna was raped by Sean O\u2019Reilly, Johnny\u2019s son. She had a son, Ben, as a result of the rape.Dimpna had left Dingle 27 years ago to become a vet in Dublin, and had married Niall. She had never been back to Dingle. Ben was totally unaware that he was really Sean O\u2019Reilly\u2019s son. Dimpna\u2019s father\u2019s predicament brought her back to Dingle. Was Eamon in a right mind to kill Johnny? And why wait 27 years?Confused? I\u2019m sure you will enjoy how the author takes the reader down various paths to solve the murder.",

                "reviewText": "Review: No Strangers HereIntriguing and imaginative plot, well told but this reader was seriously irritated and disappointed by two issues to do with the writing:1. The story could have been set anywhere. Attempts to set it in Dingle were contrived and tokenistic. A casual cruise past a few items from the local tourist brochure does not capture a sense of place and authenticity. This is just lazy writing and, in choosing this book, I expected better.2. The unrelenting American spelling and language were jarring and a real turn-off. These are Irish people, speaking to each other, in Ireland. They do not say \u2013 just two examples \u2013 \u201cthe dog had not been to the bathroom\u201d or \u201cshe pressed the gas pedal\u201d!I will not be reading any more of this author\u2019s series.",
