                "reviewText": "As a major Ken Follett fan, for me to say this one was disappointing is an understatement. First, it was at least 1/3 longer than necessary.Not the least of the disappointments was that it couldn\u2019t decide whether or not it was a spy thriller or a Hallmark movie - with a plot almost as predictable as a Hallmark movie. In the novel, the Arabs are trying to build a nuclear bomb. Israel hears of it and plots to steal enough plutonium to build one of their own as a bargaining child.Throw in an Arab-ancestry girl whose university professor father\u2019s idealism causes him to treat his daughter as a household possession and servant, and stir in the fact that the daughter falls almost instantly in love with an Israeli intelligence officer plotting to steal the plutonium, mix in one too many coincidences of former students at the university together who all wind up being agents for their own countries, and you have a rather predictable, rather dull spy \u201cthriller.\u201d. He\u2019s written far better, far more enjoyable books. It was a moderately good read, but certainly not the thriller I was expecting.",
