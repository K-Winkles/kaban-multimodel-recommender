                "reviewText": "The Woman Beneath The Stairs is the best psychological suspense I\u2019ve read in a long time. Brilliantly written, it grabs you and won\u2019t let go.Tim and Ally embark on a trip to Maine to see his ill mother and twin brother Tom. When they arrive at the home on a private island things aren\u2019t as expected. When the police arrive looking for a missing woman and try to implicate her husband she isn\u2019t sure what to believe. Soon bodies are stacking up, their boat is sabotaged, and they have no communication with the outside world.Ally is already struggling with depression and taking medication. When she starts to hear a woman\u2019s voice she wonders if what\u2019s she\u2019s experiencing is real or a figment of her imagination. She needs to find out the truth.Each person in the book has quirks, attitudes, or physical characteristics that set them apart from the rest making it interesting while strengthening the mystery as to who is actually committing murder on the island, and why.I love a book that keeps me guessing right to the end and this one hit the mark. It was perfectly paced, with each clue hidden within diversions that sent me on a few side paths leading in different directions. Add in plenty of heart pounding action and I couldn\u2019t put it down. I highly recommend this book.",

We have a hypochondriacal matriarch, a \u201csuperhero\u201d twin, the unknowing husband, the depressed wife, more twins, Uncle Phillip and so much more. Old bodies, new bodies, and almost more bodies than can be counted. Readers, however, can count on the author for an interesting twist.",
