                "reviewText": "The oft-overused word \"Unputdownable\" certainly applies here. The book quickly establishes what seems to be a simple situation, but immediately introduces complications that enmesh a small ensemble of characters in an ever-expanding web of lies, and it is impossible to stop reading until all the whys and wherefores are revealed. And when the final showdown happens, unlike a lot of books that require pages and pages of boring explanation and loose-end-tying, this one is so skilfully written none of that is necessary and it stays intriguing to the end. I was going to subtract one star for its abrupt ending - I wanted to know what happened afterwards! But I decided to give it full marks because it was such a good read.",

A place for families.William Wooler is a family man, on the surface. But he\u2019s been having an affair, an affair that ended horribly this afternoon at a motel up the road. So when he returns to his house, devastated and angry, to find his difficult nine-year-old daughter, Avery, unexpectedly home from school, William loses his temper. Hours later, Avery\u2019s family declares her missing. Suddenly Stanhope doesn\u2019t feel so safe. And William isn\u2019t the only one on his street who\u2019s hiding a lie. As witnesses come forward with information that may or may not be true, Avery's neighbors become increasingly unhinged. Who took Avery Wooler?REVIEW :Prior books by this author for me were Not A Happy Family (\u201821 - 4 Stars), The End of Her ('20 - 4 Stars), Someone We Knew (\u201819 - 4 Stars), An Unwanted Guest ('18 - 3 Stars), A Stranger in the House ('17 - 4 Stars) and The Couple Next Door ('16 - Read '17 - 4 Stars).Ms. Lapena is one of my authors that just ropes you in right away. Like the title says, there are sooo many secrets and some people are enjoying this tragedy just a little too much. Ms. Lapena\u2019s writing is soooo good, the plot is almost secondary. Kept me guessing and trying to decide who I think is guilty and then BAM ! WHAT ! I can\u2019t wait to see where this goes! Loved the curvy path this book took to the end.Two books in a row for me that were 5-stars but got dropped to 4 stars because of the endings. This book and Strange Sally Diamond by Liz Nugent.",

And when a child is dismissed from school because of her terrible behavior.Avery walks home from school after being dismissed, and her father walks in on her afterwards. They argue, he slaps her, and then everything changes.Does he leave, or does he take her away?When nobody knows what happened to Avery, the police search and question everyone on the street.Many of the neighborhood are connected in one way or another. When answers are not forthcoming, we are left to wonder.As the story unfolds, the reader is glued to the pages. A 5 star read.***",

                "reviewText": "A quiet upper middle class neighborhood explodes with drama when nine-year old Avery goes missing after school one day. There were plenty of suspicious characters who could have taken her, including her own father. And there are a ton of secrets exposed as the story unravels. None of the characters was particularly likable but some were relatable. My favorite character happened to be Avery\u2019s brother Michael, a victim in his own way because he blamed himself for her disappearance. The plot was moderately well-paced, with a few twists and a real surprise at the end. Good suspense and excellent domestic drama.I checked out this book from the local library using the Libby App. All opinions expressed are my own.",
