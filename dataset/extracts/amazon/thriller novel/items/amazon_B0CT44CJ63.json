However, the middle of the book dragged on and on...and was repetitive at timesStacey is a coroner who is engaged to Henry...a Dr. At first they seem happy, but as time goes on Henry seems to have issues with intimacy and his mood swings. Stacey is always trying to make things right (ugghh)Then there is murders of young women who look a lot like stacey! Stacey's Ex, Matt is a detective and is on this case. He doesn't like Henry and it seems lke Henry is #!1 suspect. Stacey wants to prove her fiance's innocent but things aren't adding up.The investigation part is where things went slowly. There was no real twist and I saw what the ending was from the middle of this book I felt this book could've been done in 300 pages not 400. I still recommend itI",
