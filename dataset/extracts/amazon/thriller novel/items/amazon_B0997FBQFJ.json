Now that I've moved to Paris, I figured \"why not?\" I'm a big fan of Lucy Foley's writing style and have read some of her other thrillers. This one felt subpar compared to The Guest List, but was still enjoyable. Lucy always does a great job of foreshadowing just enough that you're able to make subtle guesses, yet still keeps you wondering what's actually going on. You can also learn some French curse words as well ;)",

Too hard to be clever, surprising, and mysterious and failing on all counts. I thought it seemed a bit childish, as if written by a young person eager to impress.",

Her writing style is a great style, each chapter stated in the first person, but switching back and forth, giving you a fascinating perspective as you keep seeing what happened through the perspective of all the main characters. And, the story is delightful murder mystery, our heroine, Jess, is the gutsy, nosy, bold, sister of the missing person, who refuses to back off. Jess is written so well. Flawed and filled with shortcomings, unsure of exactly what is going on, but street smart and tenacious as a bloodhound on the scent. Foley also gives some very smart twists in the story that also added a little more believability in terms of motives and how the crime unfolded. After the story Lucy Foley gives you incite into what inspired this story, and I really enjoyed reading that as well, as you could definitely see the influences of Alfred Hitchcock, Georges Simenon, and others.",

                "reviewText": "Told in short chapters through multiple POVs, in the latest Lucy Foley\u2019s thriller we follow Jess Hadley, a bartender at the Copacabana bar in Brighton, England, who finds herself in a difficult situation in which she needs to leave everything behind. So she decides to go to Paris to visit her half-brother Ben.While Jess is on her way, her brother leaves her a message giving her instructions on how to proceed when she gets into the building. But when Jess finally arrives, Ben is nowhere to be found. His apartment is much more she could have imagined. How Ben could afford such a fancy apartment being a freelance journalist? He also left his wallet behind and Jess decides to ask around his whereabouts.The reader is left in the dark for most of the story. It is impossible not to be reminded of the Hulu series Only Murders in the Building, without the podcast element, while reading this novel. Just like in the series, everyone living in this building becomes a suspect. The building holds a lot of secrets, and secret passages, and the protagonist soon realizes that things are not what they seem.The characters are well developed. Foley gives us a background story of Jess and Ben, and their different upbringing. After their mother died, the siblings were split up. Ben was adopted by a wealthy couple and had a comfortable life while Jess lived from one foster home to another. There are some unexpected twists and her writing flows. I like the author\u2019s ability to create a creepy atmosphere.It was my first Lucy Foley and I enjoyed reading this one. I also liked how the tension was built slowly but there was nothing in this novel that really wowed me. I believe The Paris Apartment would be an enjoyable read for fans of mystery/thriller in general. It is an ok book, one that will entertain the reader without being extraordinary. Now I am curious to read more from this author.",
