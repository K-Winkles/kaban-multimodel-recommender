In the last few books I\u2019ve appreciated the temporal dovetailing. The characters have aged, are less volatile (Marino and Lucy), and you see them more as real people, albeit overachievers! The technologies of drone swarms, exoskeletons, and hacking are real and real problems. You want Scarpetta to solve the mundane personnel issues and get newer equipment. I wanted to call the governor and get that troublesome pair run out of the state. Give me more of this wonderful series and make a movie. Any ideas on casting? I\u2019d love to hear about them.",

                "reviewText": "Unnatural Death by Patricia CornwellI am a Patricia Cornwell fan. I buy her books as soon as they are on the shelf without reading the cover blurb. I also love Kay Scarpetta and the cast of characters surrounding her. But this book was a bit of a struggle for me in the beginning. I thought the book started slow and didn\u2019t pick up steam until several chapters in. But nobody writes a crime scene like Cornwell. The gore is there but Scarpetta will handle it like the professional she is. The mystery is strong . When Scarpetta suited up to recover a body, I found myself holding my breath. Cornwell has her pulse on the latest technology for crime fighters and criminals and this book is no exception. The terror is real and frightening. The mark of a good crime novelist. I love the way Cornwell uses the weather in her books to up the suspense ante. Sneaking up on the building in the snowy woods was a bit over the top but then again, were the terrorists just too arrogant to have security. Could be. Once Cornwell gets this story going, the pace is fast and furious right through the surprise ending. Kay\u2019s Italian food always plays a part in Scarpetta\u2019s stories and brings warm and cozy feelings when it is prepared and served - maybe even the feelings of a safety net. But readers know in this book, this time, there just might not be a safety net. A four star read for me.",

This novel brings the whole \"family\" together again and throws in some great surprises for her fans. The setting is exotic and enticing and the suspense real. No boring narration. Sure to keep a reader engaged and make a new reader want to go back and start at the beginning to see how these characters got to where they are today.",

I like the basic Kay, Benton, and Marino characters (although there\u2019s such a thing as one autopsy too many - but not the hypo techno doomsday Cold War scenarios nor the largely improbable plotting that puts these three, plus the (to my eyes) non-credible superwoman Lucy, in key governmental or para governmental positions with their security clearances and high tech baubles and devices. Just finished rereading all the Kinsey Millhone crime novels a and think the late Sue Grafton created a far more human environment for her groundbreaking female investigator.PS someone should tell Cornwell that no one in Italy - where I live - would follow spaghetti bolognese (small b) with panzanella which is made largely of bread AND then garlic bread as well.",

I love all the characters that have been developed for this series. The book was very good and I loved the story. But as I mentioned in my headline, there is, once again, no closure to the Carrie issue. Also hopefully, the governor will deal appropriately with Maggie and Dr. Reddy in the next book. They truly deserve whatever is coming at them. But my main concern, and this is not only with this book but with books from other authors, I do not like having the author's political stance thrown in my face. I don't do that to anyone so why should they. I no longer buy books from 4 authors I have follwed for years for that same exact issue. But I always like to give them another chance. And that is why I rated this booka 4 instead of a 5. It's reallysad that author's have to throw their poitical bent into one of their books. To this reader, it is unfair and uncalled for,.",
