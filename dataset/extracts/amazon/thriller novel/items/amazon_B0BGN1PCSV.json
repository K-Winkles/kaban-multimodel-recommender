Lewis has helped Peter Ash out of more trouble than Peter cares to remember. So he doesn\u2019t hesitate when Lewis asks a favor in return. Lewis has left his criminal past behind, but a former associate may be in trouble, and he and Peter must drive into the teeth of a blizzard to find him. When they discover blood in the snow and a smoldering cabin, both men know things are bad. Then they learn that someone has stolen notebooks full of incriminating secrets about Lewis's long-ago crimes, and realize the situation is much worse than they'd thought. To save Lewis\u2019s wife, Dinah, and her two boys, Lewis and Peter must find the notebooks. With Peter's longtime girlfriend, June Cassidy, they begin the search\u2014facing ruthless and violent foes at each turn, including one powerful person who will stop at nothing for revenge.

                "reviewText": "After taking a year off, Nick Petrie has come back roaring with one of the best books in the series.The book opens with Peter waking up in the middle of the night with Lewis in his kitchen making coffee. Lewis has gotten a text from an old friend from the bad old days, and it sounded like he was in trouble, and he wants to go check on him. That quick trip ends up showing Lewis that all of his past misdeeds are about to see the light of day, and all of his former enemies are about to get a roadmap to him, and his new life, placing everyone he cares about in grave danger.Peter and Lewis are up against something unlike anything else they have gone up against before, and Lewis is forced to wade through the sins of his past while trying to maintain the life he has built for himself.This book is great, and for the first time in the series really focuses on Lewis, his past, and who he is. While I very much hope I don\u2019t have to wait two years for the next installment, this one was worth the wait. I was not able to put it down.",

It delves more into his friend Lewis, whose somewhat shady past comes back to bite him a little bit. Well written and great story as it can be tough to constantly come up with riveting story lines in this genre of tough characters that we all enjoy. People like Rapp or the Grey Man, or Levon Cade (whose latest book also just dropped and get that one too). Highly Recommend this book and author.",

                "reviewText": "Woah, I can't believe it's Peter Ash #8 already and as always I can't turn the pages fast enough!Jack Reacher's author Lee Child once said \"Lots of characters get compared to my own JACK REACHER, but Petrie's PETER ASH IS THE REAL DEAL.\"I have to say, Peter Ash may have started loosely like Reacher, but Peter is no longer a loner. What makes this series so entertaining besides the terrific MC is Peter's close-knit friends who are like family. They are always there when Peter needs backup and let me tell you he's a trouble magnet.The Price You Pay changes things up a bit. It's now Lewis, Peter's best friend who's in the hot seat. Lewis has been a star of this series from the get-go. Lewis gets a text from an old associate Teddy that bad men were at his cabin and needed help.The bad men tried to burn his cabin and killed his dogs (NOO!! \ud83d\ude2d) Thank god it's off the pages, but still. They took a notebook which Teddy jotted down things he remembers after suffering brain trauma from taking a bullet meant for Lewis. Now, they desperately need to find the people who took it.Love the pace and this was intense! I find June's character much more likable too. I've been complaining about her a lot and I think she's not as bossy anymore. This is my first time listening to my pre-ordered audiobook so let me know if you feel that way reading. I read a third but switched to listening. The narrator Stephen Mendel was terrific too.Highly recommend this series. The Price You Pay can be read on its own but I feel it's better to know Peter and Lewis from book one.Thank you G.P. Putnam's Sons and Netgalley for my DRC.",
