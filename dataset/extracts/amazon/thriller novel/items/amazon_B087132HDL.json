The focus is on Russia's attempt to build a new secret, biological warfare complex . Plot details follow:: the Russians have spies everywhere, even in the US including the CIA. The Russian lab makes a deadly new biological weapon but a deadly leak occurs so the Russians try to kill many of their scientists and lab workers as they can or need to, to cover it up. CIA agents infiltrate and rescue anti Russian scientists, Many of the CIA achievements ridiculous. one young, heroic CIA agent was captured and repeatedly and horribly tortured. Any normal person would have died but this did not really slow her down at all. Her exploits make James Bond look like a hopeless amateur. Later she and her male partner, another Bond-type, easily invade the Kremlin and escape in a helicopter, despite being shot at by thousands of of rounds of ammunition and severely wounded. The CIA double agent is killed as are the Russian spies in the US--and so on. If you can put up with with extreme fiction this is an exciting read.",

I am looking forward to reading the continue story in the next novel. Due to that which seems plausible and true the story made me pause and reflect on what a Cold war truly means and the treat of bioweapons from any country. Add to that what is going on with cyber threats and A.I., praying for peaceful and trusted agreements seems almost futile. However, I still trust and pray a solution will be found.",

This is the first book that I have ever read from this author, but I will probably read more.It features Lance Spector as a CIA asset who is working to stop the Russians from deploying a biological super weapon. I had a bit of trouble getting into the story in the first several chapters and had to go back and start over after being away from it for a few days, as the other characters didn't stick with me as well as leading characters normally doThis is the first book in this series. I don't consider it as top tier as say Brad Thor or Jack Carr, but it is still better than a lot of novels out there.",

You feel that the author knows the former Soviet Union, Moscow, the details of now Russian political investigation techniques and deception. He mixes elementary psychology about women in the forefront.I couldn\u2019t let the book down...and will definitely continue the series. Than you, Author Herzog",

When we first encounter him, he is in a remarkable situation that immediately forges an emotional connection between him and the reader.With such a great introduction, Saul Herzog sets the bar pretty high from the start and doesn\u2019t let go til the very end.The characters are among the most fully realized that I came across in this genre in quite a while. The story is deftly plotted, and Herzog pulls together the many threads of the complex narrative masterfully at the end.The pacing is also very good and the thrill-factor of the many shocking twists is amplified by the pulse-pounding action scenes, which have an alluring cinematic touch to them.THE ASSET is a truly stunning debut and I can\u2019t wait to see how the story continues in THE RUSSIAN!",
