                "reviewText": "At first it doesn\u2019t come across as a student-teacher relationship. Freida McFadden slowly works her way to that point by introducing Addie a student who came back to high school after a scandal with her previous English teacher. Her return to school has been difficult. Her classmates have ostracized her and Kenzie has started bullying her. Addie doesn\u2019t stand-up to Kenzie or tell the Principal. Nate her English notices and takes the initiative to make her feel special. He encouraged her to join the school newspaper. Addie wishes his wife was as nice as Nate since she\u2019s in her math class. Eve isn\u2019t nice like Nate in fact Eve doesn\u2019t like her very much.\u2026Freida McFadden tells the story from Addie and Eve\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s interesting that she chose those two characters one being a teacher and the other a student. Remember when I mentioned this is a student/teacher relationship? Let\u2019s refresh. Nate and Eve are married. Both are teachers at the same high school. Addie is in Nate\u2019s English class and in Eve\u2019s math class.It\u2019s freakin fantastic how Freida McFadden wrote this story into three parts. These parts helped move the story along. Excellent execution. When the story finally reaches the scandalous part I think finally something juicy to bite into. Usually I like to figure out the next move, but not in this case. I\u2019m letting Freida McFadden tell her story.",

Eve teaches math, where Nate teaches English. Eve is known for being a strict teacher, who not to many students like. Nate is the opposite, he\u2019s loved by all the students, and is known for being the most attractive teacher. Eve and Nate\u2019s marriage has been struggling for a while, and has become very routine.Addie is a trouble high school junior. She\u2019s been ostracized and is being bullied by her classmates for an alleged affair that got a teacher fired. When Nate starts to be nice to Addie because he can see she\u2019s really having a hard time, Addie develops a crush on him, then she starts to do things she shouldn\u2019t do, until one time she goes too far.I enjoyed this, but I didn\u2019t find myself at the edge of my seat like I typically do when reading one of Freida\u2019s books.",

Then Nathaniel tries to kill his wife and bury her alive. Mrs. Bennett is a math teacher at the high school. She was obsessed with shoes.. high heel shoes. She keeps going to the store and buying shoes. Jay is the one that keeps waiting on her.. She has an affair with Jay. Now back to Nathaniel trying to kill is wife. That\u2019s not enough. He talks Addie into helping him bury his wife. I won\u2019t spoil the end. You\u2019ll just have to read it yourself. Frida does such a great job and there\u2019s more than one turn of events. Like I said, read it for yourself. You won\u2019t regret it I read this book less than four days. That\u2019s with two special kids trying to take care of them. If I can read it, so can you.

                "reviewText": "I was not really sure what to expect from this book. I mean it\u2019s Freida, so you already know she\u2019s going to take you on a mind trip \u2013 you just never know which way the trip is going to go. The \u201cnot truly a twist\u201d twist that everyone could see coming in the early part of the book was, as I say, expected; however, the things that happened after were not. The twist happened so quickly that I thought maybe I missed a couple of pages, \u2014it felt like it was just thrown in there randomly. But as I scrolled back on my Kindle app, I realized I had not missed any pages. It just happened a lot quicker than I thought it would. Everything that happened after was really the impetus to continue reading something that I was initially ready to dismiss as wildly predictable. I\u2019m glad it went the way that it did, and as usual with Big Freida, as she is affectionately known in some of the online book groups I\u2019m in, you end the book thinking \u201cwow she did it again.\u201d",

                "reviewText": "spoilers aheadi liked that the chapters were super short, i feel like even shorter than other books by fmf. made it really easy to read. i wasnt a fan of the fact that 100 pages in i didnt have much backstory on the characters which is a third of the book. i think that may be on purpose now after reading the rest for suspense but i feel like we barely know the characters.one thing i loved was that the MC actually found out about the people in her life betraying her BEFORE the last chapter of the book. i love a good revenge plot.the only thing that made me give the book 4 stars was the ending. i feel like it came too quickly & wrapped up and entire story in one chapter. then i feel like the epilogue i guess makes sense, but kind of stupid and makes the story pointless. so i just spent the whole book hating the man but shes just as bad? i mean yay for jaw dropping ending i guess but couldve done without that tidbit i think, personally",

Man braucht hier etwas Geduld, aber der Schluss ist wie immer eine 10 von 10. Habe das Buch in ca 2 Tagen (Trotz einem Vollzeitjob) Durchgelesen. Vielleicht schreibe ich deswegen diese Rezession nachts um halb zwei. Werde ich es morgen bereuen? Vielleicht, w\u00fcrde ich es f\u00fcr dieses Buch wieder tun? Auf jeden Fall!!",

                "reviewText": "I love Freida Mcfadden she's the queen of plot twists and psychological thrillers, head and shoulders above everyone in my opinion. This book was one I very impatiently waited for being released. I was not disappointed, the story runs smoothly as always then the cracks appear and suddenly there's chaos and you can't put it down because you need to know what's going to happen next. I always love the little plot twists as much as the big ones and that's why she's in a league of her own!! The characters were the usual mix of love them and love to hate them and the story was amazing and actually got pretty creepy at the end but I loved it",

It's an absolute page-turner from start to finish. The author had me gripped from the beginning, and the ending totally surprised me. Definitely a worthy 5-star read!",
