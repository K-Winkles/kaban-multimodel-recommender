Her previous actions at a gunfight in Texas\u2014and her incredible skills with firearms\u2014draw the attention of several branches of the US government, and make her a perfect fit for even more dangerous work. The Department of Homeland Security and the NSA have tasked her with infiltrating a hacker group, known only as Ordinary People, that is intent on wreaking havoc. Letty and her reluctant partner from the NSA pose as free-spirited programmers for hire and embark on a cross country road trip to the group\u2019s California headquarters.While the two work to make inroads with Ordinary People and uncover their plans, they begin to suspect that the hackers are not their only enemy. Someone within their own circle may have betrayed them, and has ulterior motives that place their mission\u2014and their lives\u2014in grave danger. Read more",

As I approach middle age, I have found that my concentration has been failing. I read a few pages of a book and return to it later. I found this book to be so fast paced that I couldn't put it down! Very well written, great characters, and action. I hope that there's another Letty book coming.",

Clever to bring the war straight into it. Loved the characters, especially Baxter who I\u2019m sure we will hear more from, and glad to see Cartwright still around. Still with the quick sharp tongue and wit, that fine balance is always there, it just didn\u2019t exceed any expectations.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second Letty Davenport novel. The character is a spin off from the Lucas Davenport \u201cPrey\u201d series. That series, over thirty books now, was, until quite recently five star quality. That\u2019s for another review. Any of the series can be read as a stand-alone. I\u2019ve enjoyed each from the onset of the series.Anyway, Lucas Davenport began as a Minneapolis Police Detective. Then an Agent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Most recently, a free lance Deputy U.S. Marshal. He and his team rescued Letty from a horrific child abuse ring. Then he and his wife adopted her. Letty is very, very tough and as a teenager shoots dead two home invaders bent on murdering her adoptive family..Then, her series begins. She is a twenty something aide to a very influential Senator and an investigator for a Senate Committee. She is armed, partnered with a retired special operations soldier and tasked with looking into missing oil. This leads to a harrowing chase ending in a confrontation with militia types at the Mexican border. A bit out there, but still quite good.In this book, she is now a credentialed Special Agent of the Homeland Security Department Inspector General.Partnered with a female CIA Officer, and a male computer nerd employed by NSA, she is tasked with identifying a group of hackers who disrupted the Russian rail system in the run up to the invasion of Ukraine. She locates the hackers, now pursued by extraordinarily incompetent Russian government killers. There is a lot of very implausible action and eventually a satisfactory resolution.Sandford\u2019s strengths are character development (especially sociopaths) and dialogue.Weaknesses. I am a retired prosecutor. In this genre, I look for authenticity. Not Jack Webb/Joe Friday dialogue\u2026but at least plausibility. These characters move from gun fight to gunfight, shooting villains, most of whom, in fairness, need shooting. And then just move on with no consequences. And insert themselves into situations that even most TV scriptwriters know would result in multi-agency, super sized investigations. And, again, the villains are just so very incompetent.I gave it three stars because the plot moves. There are some very well executed segments. But, it\u2019s wildly implausible and way too long. And, disappointing to me because John Sandford has done so much better in so many prior novels.",

                "reviewText": "John Sandford introduced a slightly feral girl to his Prey series. Letty West was a half-starved pre-teen with an alcoholic mother and serious survival skills. Over time, she became the adopted daughter of Lucas Davenport, the protagonist of that series. As she grew older, she was involved in a variety of mayhem and murder, and I always thought she deserved her own series. Here it is. Letty is well-educated, very smart, and just as tough as ever. She's ready to make her mark in law enforcement and starts out with a bang. My only complaint is that Letty had dark blond hair in the Prey books, but now has brown hair, which is jarring. Sandford hits the mark on how a woman's character can be shaped by childhood trauma; Letty's personality suits what we already know of her.",
