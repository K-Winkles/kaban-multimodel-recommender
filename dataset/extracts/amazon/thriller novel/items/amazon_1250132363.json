                "reviewText": "I do not know how to feel about this book. I usually finish a book within a day or two after starting, I enjoy my wind down in the evenings to read my kindle, or during school pick up I read. This book had such a hold on me bad and good. It was so repetitive and frustrating half of the book. Grace felt that she couldn\u2019t escape, he painted this image of her using a mental illness, as said in the book - he was always one step ahead of her. But that\u2019s what made it so aggravating to read. Surely, people you would call friends in either side on the picture cannot be so oblivious to such a \u201cperfect marriage\u201d the fact they shared an email made it so unreal. I guess I looked at the situation as I\u2019m an Esther. I look at the perspective differently and I\u2019m not a naive person, which I will call out. And the fact that Jack often spoke for Grace, was so annoying and how there wasn\u2019t much more fight to this aspect. Wonderful Millie, thought of how to take him down, and I would have fought so much harder when Esther was prying. With all the dinner parties I would have clung to anyone and proved to them the red room, where she sleeps, I just felt there were so many missed opportunities by Grace that I couldn\u2019t continue reading. So I put the book down until the following night, it really wasn\u2019t until Millie gave Grace the idea that the book really intrigued and I couldn\u2019t put it down. That was disappointing because the book was basically over at that point. The ending, I wish there had been more but honestly I felt the author didn\u2019t even give us enough throughout the whole book why would I expect more at the end. It\u2019s an ok read again, until your closer to the end. I wanted to give my review because I love reading, I understand that this can be real like, but Grace was weak and I felt she could have done so much more, it was fight to keep Millie away but I truly didn\u2019t see the fight, beautiful Millie did it all on her own.",
