                "reviewText": "Decent story overall, but too long and drawn out and way too many POV characters.Also, I was turned off from the beginning because I dislike the wrongly accused trope.Ellen and Adam Walsh have purchased The Meadowhouse, with the financial help of Adam's parents for the purchase and upcoming renovations. They are parents of the rebellious teen Orla and young twins Max and Kian. Ellen is a teacher, and Adams travels a great deal for his job. It's a big balancing act for Ellen to do everything she needs to do. Then she gets a threatening note, and strange things keep happening. Is this related to Ellen's past? What secrets are hidden behind closed doors?Each point of view character seems to have a reason to threaten Ellen. For me as a reader, I knew that Ellen was being wrongly accused of at least some of the things, but others in the story believed them and it was just irritating to me as I really dislike reading this type of storyline. However, Ellen is not a great person, so some of it she deserved I suppose.I loved the Cat Kinsella series, and while the writing is equally as good here, it just got bogged down for me. Plus, none of the characters are likable, I didn't really feel like I had anyone to root for. I also didn't have buy in for the ultimate resolution to who was behind everything and why, it just didn't seem like a strong enough motive to me to cause SO much drama.If you like juicy domestic drama, this is a decent choice and I look forward to seeing what Caz Frear comes up with next.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a well-rounded domestic mystery with multiple players, each having a motive to ruin Ellen\u2019s life. Caz Frear does a wonderful job weaving each person\u2019s story together to make you wonder what will happen next and who is truly involved. As the story progresses, the lies pile up and the characters become more entangled until the jaw-dropping ending \u2013 which I never saw coming!Although Ellen\u2019s life is slightly frazzled, she has everything going for her. She\u2019s purchased her dream home and is about to embark on its total remodel, she is up for a prized position at the school where she works, and she has a loving husband who supports her. One day, she gets an anonymous letter in the mail that says \u201cpeople have to learn there are consequences.\u201d Who could have sent it and what does it mean? As she struggles to determine who is out to get her, the threats become increasingly more severe, ultimately affecting everything and everyone she holds dear. What exactly has she done to warrant such a response?Each chapter of this novel ends with a little cliffhanger that keeps you wanting to read just one more. It was hard to set this one down when I needed to and there is SO much to discuss! Perfect for fans of domestic drama, creepy circumstances, multiple points of view, and an ending you won\u2019t see coming!I received an advanced copy, all thoughts are my own.",
