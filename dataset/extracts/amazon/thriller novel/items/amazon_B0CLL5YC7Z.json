The team gets word that Americans are being held hostage by a Mexican Drug Cartel, along with a journalist who is attempting to \u201cout\u201d them. COVERTLY, even from the Board! They decide that the intel is credible enough to undertake this mission on their own with NO SUPPORT from the Board. Chase is determined to retire after this mission because he and Penny have a child on the way.There are lots of ups and downs during this mission that make the situation and rescue very fluid. The team is determined to have a positive outcome. Anya is brought in to train the team in knife fighting and joins the mission \u2026. She seems to be harboring a secret from Chase and on many occasions attempts to tell him, but interruptions persist.As always, the action is non-stop, and the cliffhanger is tantalizing. Another winner for Cap!I\u2019m one of Cap\u2019s Beta Readers \u2026 the SLOW-READING ONE! After all these years, this man\u2019s capacity for exciting, well-written storytelling is PHENOMENAL! I do pay for an additional copy in case I want to \u201ctrash\u201d him \u2026.. NOT AT ALL LIKELY because Cap is ALWAYS got his game on!Treat yourself to this FANTASTIC Chase Fulton novel.",

I am still proud to find the main character living his life with a prosthetic as he would otherwise without one.I myself try to live by the same mantra. I am the same person, just shaped different. I may be handicapped, but I am not cripple. Like in golf you may play ranked handicap but you have to still play the whole game.The loss of the child is heartbreaking and I sincerely hope Chase and Penny get another shot at being parents.Like Anya said...with the burden of the knowledge that so much life has been lost at his hands, to experience the gift of creating life would somehow make it palatable.",

The baby part of the story was at least interesting and You did do a good job writing that through. Not sure If I had a better idea for an end to that part of the book. The basic story falls in line with most of the really good shoot em-ups that Cap has put together in the 23 books. I enjoyed this as much as all the others. I did make it all the way to the landing in Cano before I spent the rest of the night finishing the book. Like so many other people I am a huge fan! Great job!",
