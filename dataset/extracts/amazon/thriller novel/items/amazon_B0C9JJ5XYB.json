As a crime thriller it ticks all the right boxes, with sufficient tension and twists to keep the reader on their toes. At times very graphic, it holds back on several details \u2014 particularly pertaining to Alana (Alan)'s back story. No doubt more will be revealed in the next instalment. A gripping and worthy addition to the genre.",

                "reviewText": "I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book, given to me by Storm Publishing via NetGalley. All thoughts and opinions are my own.A gripping, suspenseful thriller story set in Dublin, \u201cThe Puppet Maker\u201d, by Jenny O\u2019Brien (Storm Publishing), features an unusual leading detective and a cast of characters that will grow on you as the narrative progressesI liked the complexity of the plot and how the different plotlines gradually tied together and characters that initially seemed unrelated later interconnected.Alana Mack is an interesting leading character; it\u2019s great that she\u2019s a woman in a man\u2019s world, disabled, and that there\u2019s no great drama or fuss about it. She\u2019s strong, determined and brave.All the characters, relationships and interaction grew more compelling as the story went on. I was particularly curious about a potential romance between Alan and Billy, and amazed with William\u2019s dramatic baptism by fire.The story is hard and gruesome, a cruel portrayal of domestic abuse and violence and how violence perpetuates itself through generations.I liked the depiction of Dublin and its outskirts and how the scenery and the weather and climate conditions are important elements of the story.Some details seemed too unprofessional or rash to be believable: wouldn\u2019t examine carefully the child be an immediate task? Although explained, William\u2019s decision to advance alone seemed amateurish, even puerile.Even if I liked that the heroine is a wheelchair user and adjusted to her new reality, I felt sometimes the disability\u2019s portrayal was a bit superficial.",

                "reviewText": "The Puppet Maker is so, so good. Like, the kind of reading experience where you don\u2019t want to put the book down because you have to find out what happens next, kind of good. There are mysteries that reveal the culprit over time, and then there are mysteries that have already allowed you into the culprit\u2019s world, fearful of what they might do, or who will be the next target. That\u2019s the type of story the author has created here, and it worked wonderfully.There are different viewpoints provided that help to round out the plot, and I think it helped tremendously. The story is told primarily from Alana\u2019s perspective\u2013or Alan, as she\u2019s best known by\u2013but she can only relay her side of things, particularly when it pertains to the police and all they are attempting to do to save possible victims from death, or in this case, a fate even worse than death. I loved the connect-the-dot moments that tie in the little girl Casey with the human remains, and the victims and why they\u2019ve been targeted.The pacing within the pages is perfection. Nothing was sped up or slowed down in such a way that would make me feel bogged down by plot points or events that delineate from the story. I felt like I was watching some sort of real-life crime scene investigation unfold in front of me, like I was one of Alan\u2019s team members, trying to solve a mystery. At one point, we discover that there is a mole who has been working behind-the-scenes, leaking crucial information to media outlets, and when the mole is finally revealed, I was pretty shocked by that. The way Alan handles that situation was amazing and more than justified.I also wasn\u2019t sure if in the end, Casey would be reunited with her mother. That sort of resolution could have swung either way, but the discovery of that felt like it was the right call. With how quickly Casey seems to attach herself to Alan, I really didn\u2019t know how things would go, but I\u2019m glad it went down the way it did. It looks as though this is the first book I\u2019ve read by author Jenny O\u2019Brien, which is a complete shock to me. I plan on changing that. The Puppet Maker is a definite five-star page turner!",

                "reviewText": "Detective Alana Mack (Alan to her friends) was still recovering from the shattering injury which left her in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, and learning to delegate more, as her ability to be on the front line had lessened immensely. Paddy, her partner, was learning to tread the fine line in caring for Alan, but not mollycoddling her. It was the discovery of a distraught abandoned child, approximately two years old, who said her name was Casey and she wanted her Mammy, that set the small Clonabee police station on high alert. At the same time Casey was brought to the station, two homeless men fronted up with a bag which contained human remains, plus there was a report of a missing man, who had seemingly vanished from his home the night before. Suddenly from no cases to several - were they linked? - Alan and her team were inundated with work.The discovery of the note in Casey's clothes led them to keep details quiet, as it was obvious that both Casey and her mother were in danger. When another man went missing, the race was on; the clock was ticking. Could Alan and her team find the killer before more deaths? Would they be able to find Casey's mother before it was too late? And who was the mole in the department who was leaking to the media?The Puppet Maker is the 1st in the Detective Alana Mack series by Jenny O'Brien and it was fast paced, action packed, and brutal! I thoroughly enjoyed Alan's character and her determination to ignore her disability as best she could. Set in Ireland near Dublin - a place I'd love to visit - the story was narrated both by Alan, and Casey's mother. I'm looking forward to #2 in the series. Highly recommended.",

The dual point of view provided insights into the killer\u2019s motives, as well as the police investigation. All of the characters were cleverly drawn, and the team dynamics between the detectives provided several lighter moments.An excellent start to this series. Looking forward to reading the next one.",

She has a back story that is touched upon but as a wheelchair bound detective she has to use intellectual skills over physical attributes. This is a great story building up to a strong climax and an excellent read! I look forward to the next book in the series!",

I look forward to see how they develop in the series. The plot was nicely paced and loved that characters from her Welsh series made an appearance. Looking forward to book 2.",

                "reviewText": "A crime thriller set in Dublin(my home town) should have been right up my street but although this book was ok I just didn\u2019t connect with it.Two missing men, bags of human organs found in a public bin and an abandoned child at a supermarket set the scene for The Puppet Maker.Our main character is Detective Alana Mack, a recently wheelchair bound and divorced woman, her back story is hinted at but never really explained.The story really draws you in with some fascinating story lines as openers but it doesn\u2019t live up to its initial promise.The book drags quite a lot, reading a lot longer than it\u2019s page count, the characters I never really bonded with which didn\u2019t help and it did feel a bit repetitive.I wanted to empathize with Alana more and root for her but, after initial promise, her character wasn\u2019t all that interesting or well written. I do with we were given her full back story.Anyway it wasn\u2019t a bad book just not that great a one. I think 3 stars is a fair assessment.",
