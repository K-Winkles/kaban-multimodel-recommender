                "reviewText": "I gave this 4 stars because I think what could have been great storytelling was overshadowed by some serious plot holes and a rushed ending. I want to say first, that I liked the idea of who the antagonist turned out to be but the ending overall seemed rushed and completely far fetched. No spoilers but those who read it, music studio really? For all that time? Also, without giving too much away, the detective and the DNA test? Yea right that was so far fetched it was almost laughable. The author would have been better off having the reader wait for the DNA results to come back than to add that unnecessary twist for even more shock value. It didn't work and was insulting to one's intelligence. Another huge let down (without revealing who) is how the police ruled and closed two very suspicious deaths in a neat little bow and didn't investigate further? Also I felt like there were things thrown into the story and never explained just because...Who were the two people outside of Meredith's house that Cassandra saw?Who was the car following Bea and Kate?Was Marty and Shelby having an affair?Don't get me wrong, despite everything mentioned above I enjoyed this book alot. I think if it were tweaked a little and didnt have a rush ending this could have been brilliant. I would still recommend but if you read you will have questions.",

And I\u2019m always a little disappointed when I know what\u2019s going to happen at any point. This is a VERY descriptive book. The kind that takes pages to describe the weather. That gets old. I found myself skipping many paragraphs I knew were just descriptive. A little annoying. But it did allow me to finish it in just two days because I could skip so much.",
