                "reviewText": "Jack Slater is a good writer, but he could have benefited from some solid editing. The characters were engaging and well formed and Slater's writing style is crisp and skillful. I'd certainly give another one in the series a try.Here's the problem there were occasions in the story where there were serious disconnects. For example, early in the story (so as not to give away too much) he rushes into an active shooter situation unarmed and goes to a lot of trouble to get a handgun off an dead cop. Yet only a few pages before he had his own gun tucked into his waistband. Similar disconnects occur throughout the story. There are times when someone he's working with is prescient with no plausible explanation of how they acquired the information. The story line goes to great lengths to show the impossibility of getting that type of information due to a third party controlling and corrupting intelligence information. Our hero is supposed to be in the dark, yet he's not in the dark. Furthermore, he turns up when something is about to happen, thwarts it and doesn't even consider the possibility that they might try again. The person Jason Trapp saves is left alone and unprotected the next afternoon. Doesn't compute. If he tightens up his stories and clears up contradictions in the plot, his writing style and interesting characters should make him an author to read over and over again. Since there are already many books in the series, he's either done it by now or not. If he hasn't, I'll attempt to read one more and give up.I could be wrong, but I suspect a lot of ebook writers don't simulateously work with a reputable publishing company that offer the kind of help this book could have used and it may seem too tedious to reread your work several times to pick up on plot flaws. I've reread this review and bet I've missed errors, so it happens and everything written could benefit from an impartial review by experienced eyes. Thankfully, ebook writers who don't use publishing house editors do tend to improve in subsequent books. I hope Jack Slater has done that because he has one quality that only a few really good writers have. He has the ability to get you sucked into the story from the very beginning. I am often amazed how a large percentage of authors can't create a \"page turner\" from the first chapter. Only previous readers through reviews or word of mouth make you plod onward past dull openings in many books. There are so many books and so little time, I want to be engaged from the first chapter, if not the first page. On that, Slater gets 5 stars.",

Ein Plot, der ein Land an und \u00fcber den Abgrund bringt und mittendrin - Jason Trapp. Vor six month f\u00fcr KIA im Yemen erkl\u00e4rt und seitdem off grid, wird er smack dab in die blutigen Ereignisse waterboarded. In Boston wird er zum Hero als er ein weiteres Massaker verhindert. Sein Team aus hunted CIA operatives und dem Deputy Director/ CIA Mitchell, den er f\u00fcr den Tod seines Freundes und Partners Ryan Price verantwortlich macht, es aber nicht ist wie es sich herausstellt, der special activity division und former Trapp's Boss, Kyle einem IT Nerd der NSA und Perkins und Winks. dazu gesellt sich Special Agent Nadine \"Dani\" Carter, finden sich in eine Welt geworfen, die brualer und grausamer und r\u00fccksichtsloser nicht sein kann. Ein Land f\u00e4llt in sich zusammen, die NSA hacked, FBI und law enforcement kompromitiert, Nash ein neuer rookie President im Office und eine conspiracy, die genau dort hin strebt. Whoa!Klasse. Fast- paced action mit einem sehr sympathischen American Hero, der nicht nur fun, die scene am Ende im OO - herrlich!, sondern direkte unmittelbare action verspricht - und h\u00e4lt. Mehr als h\u00e4lt.Es hat richtig Spa\u00df gemacht mit Jasaon Trapp die Welt zu retten und ich freue mich riesig auf das zweite book \"False Flag.\"",
