I couldn't pass up that deal and decided to get it. Like I had heard before, the characters and story are different from the anime. I would say it was fun to read despite that since the characters were more likeable and the atmosphere wasn't as depressing at times. I will say the stalker's skin obsession creeped me out a bit and seemed to come out of nowhere. I would say if you liked the movie, go ahead and get the book. Just know that the source material is a completely different experience from the movie.",

I bought the book and it was a whole new story from what I had expected. Some parts were written simply yet had that gory cringe to them but you have to keep reading to know why and how things turn out. I feel like the film had actually taken both books into account and combined it into one story, minus the gore and sexual parts. I just wish Yoshikazu Takeuchi had written more books to read.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Solid enough release, disappointing story",
                "reviewText": "My copy arrived fast and in perfect condition. It was larger than I expected, and the words are also larger than you'd think on wide-margined pages, so the book overall is a fairly short one. The translation is a lot smoother than most English releases of Japanese novels that I've read, but it still suffers a bit from being so careful in following basic writing rules that you can almost feel the writer straining as you read it. The most common example of this is the way it insists on referencing characters by their job titles, i.e., \"The singer,\" to avoid repeating their names. It can be a good technique but it's used far too often and they should've rephrased some sentences instead in my opinion. There are two afterwards by the original author in the back, one from an earlier edition, one following the release of the movie. These are a nice bonus.Although this book is probably a huge treat to diehard fans of the famous anime film (which I have yet to see!), as a book in itself it is very flat and disappointing. There are far better mystery, thriller, and horror novels written in any language, and there is little to no substance beyond attempted suspense in this one. True, it does address the issues of fame and the obsessive fans, but it certainly isn't the only (or best) book to do so. It is not structured in a particularly suspenseful or interesting way. It includes details that aren't particularly relevant or interesting, and it jumps around from one dull scene to another, each from the perspective of a flat character. The most interesting character is the antagonist, but even he isn't too fleshed out. The author does have a good understanding of human emotions and how they change and develop during unusual situations, and I appreciated this, but it doesn't make up for the overall shallow book.Just an FYI in case anyone wonders, this book contains graphic sexual and violent content, so be forewarned. It is not excessive or out of place in the slightest, and the sexual content is brief enough to skip if you so desire. The book also has disturbing elements such as child molestation.Overall, I think whatever caused the film to be a \"cult classic\" isn't in this book, and I can only assume that's because the movie did in fact deviate a great deal from its source material. Worth the read for a diehard fan only.",
