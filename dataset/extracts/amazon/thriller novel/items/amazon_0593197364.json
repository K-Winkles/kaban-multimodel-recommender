I\u2019m very very relieved to feel calm and at peace with this ending. It was convincing, it felt natural, and it was a better case scenario than an easy-peasy profession of love. I enjoyed an ending that just showed their relationship in good spirits, not necessarily someone in the matter of a month deciding to move across states, foregoing their careers, or anything like that. It was just normal relationship adoration and I CAN GET WITH THAT. I absolutely loved the suspense in this one. I felt, FELT Brandon\u2019s frustration and most definitely their chemistry. Leigh was stupid in many moments but also up there near Tara (from Liam\u2019s story imo) with being a favorite and fiercely independent and powerful heroine. I COULD GET WITH IT.",

                "reviewText": "Last Seen Alone is the newest book in the Texas Murder Files series by Laura Griffin. This book is easily read as a stand alone. There is usually a character connected to previous books, but it is not necessary to read previous books to try and catch up.The book starts with a bang with the disappearance of Vanessa. She meets with someone and is given something in a bag in exchange for money. She stops on the side of the road to check her bag but gets out of her car and runs when she sees a car stop behind her. She is chased into the woods by someone. Her fear is intense.When Detective Brandon Reynolds is called to investigate an abandoned vehicle, he and his partner discover Vanessa has vanished. Her purse, phone and keys are all left in the car. There is blood on the car door and they find more blood in the woods. They aren't sure if this is a missing person case or a murder case. The only clue left behind is a business card for an attorney named Leigh Larson. Brandon and his partner track her down on her way to court. Detective Reynolds and Leigh don\u2019t start off on the right foot. She is in a hurry for court and he wants answers now. Of course Leigh doesn\u2019t tell him anything. She vaguely remembers Vanessa coming to see her once, but suspects Vanessa didn\u2019t tell her the full story. Leigh deals with women who have been victims of revenge porn and sexual harassment. She has her own reasons for seeking justice for her clients and wants to find Vanessa.Brandon and Leigh are constantly being thrown together with this case. For every step forward that Brandon makes, Leigh seems to be involved in some way. The mystery involving Vanessa and the give and take between Brandon and Leigh make this a great read. Ms. Griffin has once again told a story that involves real life situations. Her attention to detail makes this an extremely intense story.Last Seen Alone is a fantastic book. The mystery surrounding the disappearance of Vanessa was page turning. I was up way too late in the night finishing this book. The characters are believable and the suspense is engaging. The supporting characters were just as interesting as the main characters and I hope they their own story.Ms. Griffin is on my auto-buy list, and I eagerly look forward to each new book. I have read all of her books and thoroughly enjoyed each one. She writes fantastic characters, unbelievable suspense and creates a world I can become immersed in. I highly recommend this new book.",

There's quite a bit of questioning this person and that one, a little suspense here and there but then it slows down to a lot of new relationship drama. And a shallow plot. I am more than half way and realizing I bought the wrong book.",
