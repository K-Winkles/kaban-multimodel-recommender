        "description": "Winner of the New Blood Dagger, Arthur Ellis, Barry, Anthony, and Dilys awards. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sur\u00eat\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec and his team of investigators are called in to the scene of a suspicious death in a rural village south of Montreal. Jane Neal, a local fixture in the tiny hamlet of Three Pines, just north of the U.S. border, has been found dead in the woods. The locals are certain it\u2019s a tragic hunting accident and nothing more, but Gamache smells something foul in these remote woods, and is soon certain that Jane Neal died at the hands of someone much more sinister than a careless bowhunter. Still Life introduces not only an engaging series hero in Inspector Gamache, who commands his forces - and this series - with integrity and quiet courage, but also a winning and talented new writer of traditional mysteries in the person of Louise Penny.

Our only complaint is THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN A DAY and we can't read fast enough. We try to put a book aside, but Louise Penny's writing is addictive and heart reving.

                "reviewText": "4.5 stars\u2026I\u2019ve had this author and this series recommended to me several times and I finally decided it was time to give it a try. I\u2019m glad I finally did. The book started out slowly and I was wondering if I\u2019d made a mistake but when things finally picked up the story was totally engrossing and I my brain was completely engaged.Gamache is an interesting character and there is reference to an incident that stalled his career though we never get the details of it. Nonetheless he is a well respected homicide chief inspector. He has a unique way about him and his emphasis on observation immediately brings to mind Hercule Poirot. His right hand man is a god example of the archetype. The third member of the team however is a puzzle. She is annoying, irresponsible, and moronic in the extreme and I cannot believe that she continues beyond this book. There is nothing redeeming about her and it is puzzling that Gamache would keep her around after her actions in this case.Of course the other major character in the book is the village itself. Initially the whole thing is like reading a British country village mystery though the frequent French references and the clear cultural resentments do push in to bring you back to the setting. The villagers are an odd mix of people and certainly lend color to the proceedings.The climactic moment is exciting and the ending sets the stage for the next book. I will eagerly continue on with the series.",

I'm not quite convinced, but the main character, one Inspector Armand Gamache is intriguing as he seeks to find out what caused the death of one Jane Neal and who might have done it after he concludes it wasn't an accident.How the author weaves the clues in and out of the chapters, often revealed by yet another interesting, and flawed character makes for reading that kept me up far too late at night, the better to identify the murderer before any of the characters did. Alas, I didn't, but Inspector Armand did.",

                "reviewText": "Once I got beyond the first few chapters and began to sort through the characters, this resolved into an enjoyable small town murder mystery in a slightly foreign setting (Canadian border town) mostly manifested in the odd French word or Quebecois cultural reference. I liked the perceptive and humane Inspector Gamache and his subordinate Beauvoir. My problems with the book manifested at the beginning with two pet peeves: too many characters introduced too quickly to keep track of (but whose relationships were of course important to the solution of the mystery) and the shifting point of view. In third person narration, I don\u2019t mind getting inside the head of a few main characters, but the shifts happened abruptly, sometimes from one sentence to the next, occasionally leading to some confusion as to who was thinking these particular thoughts!This all made for a tangled web where I kept thinking I needed a browser to figure out when a given character had first appeared and what had been mentioned about them at the time.Probably the only character that aroused my emotions (very negatively!) was Nicole, to the point where I was more interested in seeing this rude, clueless and self-important young inspector get her comeuppance than I was in solving the murder.And also, did so many intelligent characters have be so behind the curve at the end? You just don\u2019t confront the murderer with \u201cI knew it was you\u201d in a dark house in a hurricane!Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book enough that I will probably read the series. The writer\u2019s skills became evident after the initial sorting out, and it\u2019s rare enough to find a book written with both moral grace and intelligence that I\u2019m glad to end the search for awhile.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve read all 18 books in the series, and I wanted to finish them all before writing a review ofStill Life, the first book.I was captivated by the characters, the settings, and most of all the outstanding writing, from the start \u2013 but I think the author might forgive me when I say that my impression of the first book is that she was feeling her way forward with her characters and their predicaments. In subsequent books she knows her characters better and the fluency of her writing, already formidable in the first book, grows into something amazing.One thing that strikes me straight away, as someone who dabbled in being an author and who drew on the expertise of editors, is that Ms Penney has no fear of delving into the minds of all her fictional personalities. I was taught not to do \u2018head-hopping\u2019 by going from one character to another and revealing their thoughts, but after reading Ms Penney\u2019s books I think that advice is flawed. In her novels, head-hopping works perfectly and adds to the pace and tension \u2013 and there is plenty of both. She conveys tension in such a way that I couldn\u2019t put the books down, and although that is rather a clich\u00e9, in my case it is true. So much so, that I couldn\u2019t pick up any other books by other authors until I\u2019d finished the entire series and I was sad that there wasn\u2019t a book 19 to be read.The pace is handled well \u2013 calm where it needs to be calm, and breathless where it needs to take off. For me, the various murders and deaths are only a part of the stories; pivotal points about which the lives and concerns of the cast swirl like several drama series in their own right. There is a wonderfully sharp observation of human nature and moments of humour which made me laugh rather than just chuckle.I know the books have been turned into a television drama series called Three Pines, and although I like Alfred Molina as the central character, Armand Gamache, I feel the TV series can\u2019t do justice to the books. Like most TV adaptations, it doesn\u2019t capture the flow of narrative, most of which is lost in the transition between book and film mediums.The books are superb. As the first one, Still Life is the gateway to a captivating experience, and I envy readers who haven\u2019t yet delved into the delights of the other seventeen books. In fact, I think I might read the whole series a second time, just to enjoy the brilliant writing and story-telling.",

The first page of every chapter (every single one of them!) is missing! While it does not take away the overall pleasure of reading a book with a good plot, strong characters and a narrative which is paced well, one keeps wondering what one has missed on those pages.",
