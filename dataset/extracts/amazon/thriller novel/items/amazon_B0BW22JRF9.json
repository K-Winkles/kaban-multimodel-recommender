                "reviewText": "The '70s have been coined the decade of serial killers. In 1978, a man escapes prison and descends on a Floridian sorority house with deadly results. Key witness and chapter president Pam Schumacher is permanently altered. Across the county, Tina Cannon is convinced the murders result from the All-American Sex Killer who claimed the life of her missing best friend. When Tina makes her way to Florida, she joins forces with Pam to get justice for those they love.Review:We will go in reverse order and begin with my complaints, of which there is only one. My sole complaint is that some metaphors and comparisons are a little off-putting. Describing the grown murderer as a \"booger-eater\" feels strange. While that may have been the point - to emasculate The Defendant, there are other odd comparisons. My complaint is undoubtedly tiny, insignificant, and doesn't affect my rating; it was weird enough to notice.Now, let's move on to what I enjoyed in the novel.Much like Luckiest Girl Alive, Knoll writes with a break-neck pace. The novel opens with The Defendent's attack on the sorority house, and that chapter is intense. You feel like you are Pamela, traipsing through the house, setting her friends' pain and death, and identifying the perpetrator. When I read the opening chapter, I held my breath and ran through the house with Pam. Knoll's writing pace is exceptional; the book never lulls or feels inconsequential. Every chapter is thoroughly thought-out and fits into the overall novel perfectly. As readers, we are aligned with Pam and Tina and feel their emotions as if they were our own. I believe Knoll's writing style sets her apart from other writers. She takes a genuine crime case and gives it the proper care and handling it deserves.According to Psychology Today, society is obsessed with serial killers because it helps us identify potential threats. If we know and understand the motivations of some killers, we are more likely to look for and actively avoid these potentially dangerous situations. While such an assertion is valid, with the obsession comes a forgetting of the victims, those who were taken without thought or concern. Herein lies Knoll's belief. We give so much thought and attention to the killers that their victims are tossed to the wayside. There are countless documentaries, movies, and books about serial killers, but not enough about their victims. Knoll draws the line here. While the book refers to Ted Bundy, and there is an author's note at the beginning that says as much, his name is never mentioned in the book. He is consistently referred to as The Defendant. Pam argues that people always make him more than he is, a serial rapist and killer. However, so much attention was given to his law school experience during the trials, even though he never graduated. Women align themselves with his story because he is a good-looking man. Still, according to Pam, he is only handsome because it's unusual for someone relatively attractive to commit such heinous acts. She argues that there is not much difference between him and any other man on the street. Knoll focuses on the victims and survivors rather than giving credence to his failed degree. She makes them human, something many true crime series do not do. She never names Bundy; instead, she devotes her time to getting to know the victims.As an outspoken survivor of sexual assault, Knoll handles the women's case with respect and honor. In her previously published essay, she writes about the gang rape she was subjected to and how people believed it to be her fault. In a tragic and triggering moment in the book, a character is raped, and she rationalizes and minimizes the experience by explaining that, in the grand scheme of life, being raped isn't so bad because so many women experience the same thing, yet they live on. While reading her inner thoughts, readers are struck by her shockingly disturbing rationalization, but this is precisely what happens with survivors. So many of us do not come forward because we fear what others will say about our stories. We fear that we will be blamed for the assault on OUR bodies. We minimize what happened to us because, unfortunately, it has become the norm. With a sexual assault occurring every 68 seconds, it becomes a regular part of life. As a survivor, I felt seen and recognized in the novel, which is Knoll's goal. Knoll takes her violent and life-altering experience and provides other survivors with safety and recognition; she takes back her story and becomes its author.I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading Knoll's third novel. Similar to Luckiest Girl Alive, Bright Young Women is fast-paced and vital. If you like thrillers or true crime, you will enjoy the book. I give Knoll's novel five out of five stars and highly recommend it.",

And, since I was reading a digital copy, I didn\u2019t have a dust jacket to remind me. I like to be surprised, so I started the book without looking up anything about it online. I found it slow going at first. The POVs shifted and the timeline danced around a *lot*. Once I started getting a sense of how the main characters connected, the story really hooked me. I found myself recommending it to friends who like true crime. I appreciated that the story didn\u2019t sensationalize the murders. The focus stayed on the victims and de-glamorized the criminal. I have a small quibble with the choice to use 1st person POV for one of the main characters, but only because it drew focus from the story for me because I kept trying to figure out if the POV was a clue to a plot twist that would show up near the end of the book.",

                "reviewText": "Bright Young Women may be connected to the story of an infamous serial killer, but it\u2019s breathtaking to read from the imagined point of view of some of the women who wound up in his path. It makes it so much more than simply another story from the true crime genre (no offense to folks who are in to those). Why is it so novel to read women\u2019s voices, naked with laser-focus anger? That emotion is one of the most believable, palpable things I\u2019ve absorbed from any book I can remember. At times the book is a little raw, perhaps not \u00ab literary \u00bb enough for some, but its ability to connect the dots of this decades-long story and make it so utterly timely is truly artful. Rounding up from 4.5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "This book posed a real conundrum for me. It is really well written, the story is very compelling and so many of the elements are introduced in genuine murder mystery fashion. I tore through the book in two sessions. And I was engrossed in every single page. I confess, I am a big fan of truer crime stories, have read a great deal over the years about Ted Bundy and the horror of his murder victims. And I did appreciate the fact that the author declined to identify him by name (although it was crystal clear who the perp in this story was) and focus more on the unfulfilled lives of the girls he murdered but therein lies my initial confusion and ultimate dissatisfaction. In fictionalizing the two sorority house victims, (who in reality were Lisa Levy, 20 and Margaret Bowman, 21 and one of the Lake Samamish victims (in reality Denise Naslund or Janice Ott) in creating entirely new entirely made up personas, (and not just changing their names thus creating a true Roman a Clef,) but everything about them. Their history, their interests, their families, I felt these \"bright young women\" were erased once again. Bundy is portrayed as the monster he truly was but his victims were completely invented. Yet so many other elements of the story are genuine and true. Even his very last victim, twelve year old Kimberly Leach is correctly identified, but the bulk of this novel, the main driving narrative, centers on three completely fictionalized characters. I know the author profusely thanks one of the surviving sorority sisters, Kathy Kleiner for her contributions to the story. I just can't help but wonder if she was satisfied with the final product. I know I ultimately wasn't.",

I found it to be a little too detailed at times and was sometimes confusing remembering whose perspective I was reading from and at what point in time. This is not a book I would normally pick for myself but I found it to be a good read. Obviously the subject matter is pretty disturbing, but I thought the author did a good job of being respectful of the survivors' POV and casting a light on the fact that the defendant was simply a monster whose name was not worth even mentioning.",
