                "reviewText": "This book was riveting from the onset. Right away I fell straight into the story. I was rooting for Victoria\u2019s innocence and cheering for Avery and Walt to clear her name.So many tiny things bother me. First we get Victoria telling us about how she killed Charlie but we don\u2019t figure out htf she made it out of the north tower alive from above the impact zone? Also on this topic I thought no one made it out alive past the impact zone because it was so hot and smoky and all the exits were cut off because of the fires raging inside that there was no hope for those above the area of impact and that it was the south tower that hit at more of an angle and allowed for a better chance of escape?Never mind the detail though I can suspend reality for a moment but why don\u2019t we hear about Victoria from that day? And did she pull her own tooth out? How did she lose the tooth? When she begin to plot this whole new life thing and also she had the forethought to plead her non existent innocent as she faced the possibility of dying?I\u2019m still not over the tooth. How did she lose the tooth? And how did she make it out? The main tension of the story was beautiful but these random straws suddenly thrown in at the end like her brother being alive and how that just suddenly appeared and concluded and also we never see the closure w her father - why did she never have some kind of visit or something w her dad ?I\u2019m slightly disappointed by the last 20 or so pages",

                "reviewText": "When I first started this book I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to enjoy it because just like the other book I read from Charlie the medical jargon and police procedural was a lot to get through. But I enjoyed the mystery so much and the characters that the jargon took a backseat and didn\u2019t bother me like the last time.The story opens up with a death in the Catskills in the summer of 2001 where new detective Walt Jenkins has been assigned to the case. Famous author Cameron Young has been found naked hanging from a second-story balcony. Is it murder or suicide? We\u2019re then taken to Sept 11, 2001, in the Twin Towers where Victoria Ford who is accused of killing her married lover Cameron is meeting with her attorney minutes before one of the planes hit.Twenty years later the medical examiners' office is still working on identifying victims from 9-11 using new technology when there is a discovery of a fragment that DNA says belongs to Victoria Ford.Avery Mason is a news anchor who is looking for a new hook to secure her position and new contract when she hears about this discovery. She knows there\u2019s a story and decides to chase it. While chasing the story she stumbles on a mystery when Victorias' sister has her listen to a voicemail Victoria left her on 9-11 proclaiming her innocence. Between trying to figure out what happened to Cameron and dealing with her family drama Avery finds herself working alongside former detective Walt Jenkins who has some secrets of his own.This was a book that was so hard to put down once I got into it because of the two big mysteries I just had to solve. There is definitely a lot going on in this book but I found the storyline so intriguing that it didn\u2019t deter me from finishing or enjoying it. I also can appreciate that just when I thought I had it all figured out there was another twist that proved me wrong. If you\u2019re looking for a fun mystery with a dabble of romance this is the book for you!",

                "reviewText": "This was an enjoyable book that had some writers quirks that bothered me. The writer jumped between characters (which I like) but would spend two or three paragraphs repeating what had just happened in the characters prior chapters. It was a little annoying as I was actively reading the book and was well aware of the actions of the book.It is a new twist on the 9/11 tragedy, without going into the tragedy greatly however I think inserting a fictional character into this mass event can be off putting for some people. As a person who is fairly removed from the tragedy, I can enjoy the piece of fiction but I can see where it would be insensitive to others who experienced the tragedy more directly. There is some large scale name dropping (such as the OJ Simpson trial) that can be easily researched and proved that these characters aren\u2019t real. That would be a large sticking point to consumers of true crime who know all the details to see a fictional character be tangentially related to cultural changing events with no ability to verify it.An enjoyable read for me but I can see where this piece of work would not be suitable for all readers and could become a polarizing piece of work",
