I never bother with books with fewer than 200 pages as I like to at least have the time and pages to get into a story. You just about get into these 104 page offerings and it's all over with. AND this one ended at 83% so I didn't even get to 100 pages !! However, cos' this is where she's taken the series I've carried on downloading them. I do wait till they come up free, though. It seems a waste of money when they're done with so fast !! Let's hope she reverts back to writing them as the full-length novels in the future.The formatting was odd on the Kindle. Just before the end of many chapters the spacing suddenly widened to at least double the size it had been......She wrote the word admirative at one which I marked as should be admiring but the red squiggly line hasn't underlined it in my review so perhaps it IS a real word....and that was it for any mistakes I'd highlighted so presentation is very good.I have instalment 6 downloaded but that's another half a book and I think she's done the same with 7, too. If this persists we'll part company.",
