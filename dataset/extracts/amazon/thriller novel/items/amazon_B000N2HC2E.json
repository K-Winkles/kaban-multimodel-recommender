He is, however, called out a CIA agent by his former girlfriend, who has already been proclaimed as a traitor for turning in an IRA operative to the British and is no longer involved in IRA operations.However, a while later he is tasked with transporting $5,000,000 in gold for the purchase of stinger anti-aircraft missiles for the IRA.The story then goes through the typical political/spy thriller story: what is the true reason for transporting this gold; what does the IRA intend to do with the missiles; what does the IRA intend to do with Paul after the delivery; and where is Paul\u2019s loyalties?With the typical twists of loyalty, motivation and miraculous escaping from numerous almost fatal situations, the story keeps you guessing, and usually wrong.Overall a good story.",

The characters were interesting, and the insights into IRA activities brought a whole new vision to me of the IRA and other terrorist organizations. I lived in England during some of the worst parts of the \"Troubles\", and appreciated Cornwell providing a viewpoint I hadn't seen, that England was stuck in a mess that they wanted out of, but Ulster intransigence on both religious sides prevented a resolution. I came away knowing that terrorism makes no sense, but that terrorists have no sense and no idea of what they think they can accomplish. It's a journey with no end, and left the Scoundrel contemplating a future with no resolution.",
