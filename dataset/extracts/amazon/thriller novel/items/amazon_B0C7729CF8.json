        "description": "\"Hailed as the queen of Irish crime fiction, French spins a taut tale of retribution, sacrifice, and family.\"\u2014TIMEFrom the New York Times bestselling author of The Searcher and \u201cone of the greatest crime novelists writing today\u201d (Vox), a spellbinding new novel set in the Irish countryside.It\u2019s a blazing summer when two men arrive in a small village in the West of Ireland. One of them is coming home. Both of them are coming to get rich. One of them is coming to die.Cal Hooper took early retirement from Chicago PD and moved to rural Ireland looking for peace. He\u2019s found it, more or less: he\u2019s built a relationship with a local woman, Lena, and he\u2019s gradually turning Trey Reddy from a half-feral teenager into a good kid going good places. But then Trey\u2019s long-absent father reappears, bringing along an English millionaire and a scheme to find gold in the townland, and suddenly everything the three of them have been building is under threat. Cal and Lena are both ready to do whatever it takes to protect Trey, but Trey doesn\u2019t want protecting. What she wants is revenge.From the writer who is \u201cin a class by herself,\u201d (The New York Times), a nuanced, atmospheric tale that explores what we\u2019ll do for our loved ones, what we\u2019ll do for revenge, and what we sacrifice when the two collide.
