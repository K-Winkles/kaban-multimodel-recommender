                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Women at war",
                "reviewText": "(Original review appears in Pantheon Magazine at http://pantheonmag.com/book-review-sharp-objects-by-gillian-flynn/)At some point in most novels, a paragraph or single sentence, cleverly situated in a way that isn\u2019t expository, etches in thumbnail the major theme of a work. The better ones find ways to incorporate it as direct function of character, as in the following:\"I felt no particular allegiance to this town. This was the place my sister died, the place I started cutting myself. A town so suffocating and small, you tripped over people you hated every day. People who knew things about you. It\u2019s the kind of place that leaves a mark.\"So muses Camille Preaker, Gillian Flynn\u2019s restless reporter and sardonic anti-heroine from her debut novel, Sharp Objects. With the current buzz still humming over her latest book, Gone Girl\u2014with film adaptation by David Fincher slated for October of 2014\u2014revisiting her first book seems an apropos primer of this dark and penetrating author.Camille\u2019s a journalist for The Daily Post, the \u201cfourth largest in Chicago,\u201d a newspaper with its head barely above water, and whose editor, Frank Curry, mines the cold-case files for the next human interest tale sure to snag a Pulitzer. When the disappearance of a second girl occurs in the town of Wind Gap, Missouri, he dispatches the reluctant Camille at once to get the scoop.There\u2019s only one problem: Wind Gap is Camille\u2019s home town. Wind Gap hasn\u2019t been good to Camille, a place she has shunned for eight years. A place she describes as \u201cOne of those crummy towns prone to misery.\u201d She says this not from dread, but from a quietly haunting intimacy with torment. At the start of the novel, we learn that Camille\u2019s been freshly released into the world after spending several months under psychiatric care. She\u2019s a cutter, specifically of words. Her body is a monument to insecurity and anger, starting at the age of thirteen with Wicked carved into her left hip, and stopping at twenty-nine with Vanish. The only unmarred spot on her body is a circle of perfect skin the size of a fist, on the small of her back which she could never reach.As with most any self-mutilation, it\u2019s but the physical manifestation of deeper emotional traumas, in Camille\u2019s case prompted by the death of her younger sister, Marian, from an ambiguous illness. The tension surrounding this mysterious passing serves as lynchpin for her strained relationship with her mother, Adora, Wind Gap\u2019s unspoken matriarch. Wealthy, priggish, steeped in passive-aggressiveness and secrets, Adora is never sparing of her disdain for Camille, telling her in a casual manner: \u201cYou remind me of my mother. Joya. Cold and distant and so, so smug. My mother never loved me either. And if you girls won\u2019t love me, I won\u2019t love you.\u201dThe other of the girls she refers to is Camille\u2019s half-sister, Amma, a sexually hyper-developed thirteen year-old who heads a clique of equally spiteful girls, and who in many ways is her mother\u2019s equal in cruelty and malice.Rattling between the warring factions of her mother and step-sister, Camille attempts to investigate the abduction-murders in Wind Gap. When the missing girl, Ann Nash, turns up dead not long after her arrival in town\u2014found strangled within a cleft between two buildings, her teeth yanked out (a virtual carbon-copy of the first victim, Natalie Keen)\u2014Camille finds little help from the male authorities. Men view her as suspicious, an outsider with a dubious agenda, yet the scorn doesn\u2019t surprise or upset Camille. She\u2019s used to it. Other than her boss, Frank, who\u2019s a well-meaning but scattershot father-figure, men are often portrayed as dichotomies rather than with any subtlety or depth. They\u2019re afterthoughts, fleeting, a part of the scenery. This isn\u2019t a detriment to the book; they are as Camille sees them based on her experiences. Bill Vickery, the police chief, is an all-business cipher, dismissive of theories that don\u2019t fit his own. The fathers in the book, namely those of the two victims, as well as her own step-father, Alan, are ineffectual and milquetoast. Even one of the chief suspects, the second victim\u2019s father, Bob Nash, is such a laconic wallflower that even Camille\u2019s suspicion of him is passive.Her impulse is to be drawn towards the damaged sorts. The dark and the indifferent. She says of some teenage boys preening on the street: \"Those kids, cocky and pissed and smelling like sweat, aggressively oblivious of our existence, always compelled me.\"Two men eventually serve this function for Camille. The first is a cocksure detective visiting from Kansas City, Richard Willis. His interest in Camille is obvious to her from the start, and though attracted to him as well, she\u2019s apprehensive. She keeps him at arm\u2019s length, at first engaging in a mutual pact of information gathering from his end in exchange for company and candor from hers. But the dearth of intimacy in her life eventually topples the pact into the sexual, albeit mostly clothed in Camille\u2019s case, as she\u2019s reluctant to let any man know that she\u2019s a cutter.That revelation is ultimately bestowed upon John Keen, the second victim\u2019s older brother and on-again, off-again murder suspect in what passes for the book\u2019s most tender, affectionate scene in a roadside motel.It isn\u2019t long though before Camille realizes that her best chance to secure clues or leads resides within the secretive cliques of female enmity prevalent in Wind Gap. It is a private world where women hurt each other both overtly and passively, even at funerals. Where gossip is both weapon and shield, wielded for social advancement. This antagonism lies at the core of Sharp Objects. The book is less murder mystery and more an exploration of the cruelty that women inflict upon one another, be it friend to friend, classmate to classmate, sister to sister, or mother to daughter\u2014all of which play a role, often spanning multiple generations.Not even the two murder victims are immune from this hostility, as it is gradually learned through Camille\u2019s piecemeal interrogations of witnesses and suspects. The first victim, Natalie, had assaulted a female classmate back in Philadelphia; \u201cThey saved her left eye,\u201d is all we\u2019re left to know. The second victim, Natalie, is a chronic biter, one of her victims being Adora who used to watch over both girls at different points, thus relegating her eventually to the suspect list.But the cruelty isn\u2019t limited to others. They\u2019re just as adept in dispensing it upon themselves. Self-abuse runs rampant, from Adora\u2019s intractable plucking out of her eyebrows while tending to her dying daughter, Marian, to Camille\u2019s equally impulsive drinking and cutting, the latter acting as a coping refrain throughout.Number of synonyms for \u201canxious\u201d carved in my skin: eleven, she ponders at one point. Later on it\u2019s, Unworthy flared up in my leg, followed by, Belittle burned on my right hip, and so the scoring goes.At the heart of it all burns a generational war over control, status, and vanity. Camille and Adora\u2019s relationship, cleaved forever with the death of Marian, is in a persistent state of escalation, even in absentia. Upon Camille\u2019s return to Wind Gap, Adora wastes no time exercising all the petty cruelties and power-plays while shamelessly utilizing the plausible deniability of victimhood, all of which Camille is privy to from the get go.Every tragedy that happens in the world happens to my mother, and this more than anything about her turns my stomach.Adora\u2019s grief at having lost Marian has become a virtual hobby, one that she attempts to relive again through her two other daughters. Camille soon realizes that the milk and pills Adora\u2019s been giving them both as \u201crelaxants,\u201d are in actuality making them sicker by the day, especially Amma who\u2019s been subjected to it longer. This prompts Camille to track down the nurse that ministered to Marian during her final days, and through the rediscovering of original medical files that had been tampered with, it is learned that Adora had been slowly poisoning her first daughter for years.Much of this serves the logistical and procedural facets of the book however, which in many respects is the least important aspect of an otherwise compelling but ruthless character study of a woman at war to wrest her identity from history and genetics. When the killer of the two girls is eventually \u201crevealed,\u201d you\u2019re more beleaguered by the inevitability of it than you are shocked. But it\u2019s only because Flynn has artfully played with genre expectations and structures to lead one to such a conclusion. A twist is added near the end that upends the original reveal, and it\u2019s a shocking revelation if unexpected, a sad one if anticipated. A kind of perverse circle has closed, and in the middle sits Camille, perhaps finally with the determination to pierce through it.",

                "reviewText": "Camille is a messed up character. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I totally watched the HBO remake before reading the book so I had expectations, I expected a gothic murder mystery. What I got was a incredibly flawed broken character that was too damaged for relatability. With the cutting, sexual trauma, and her need for intimacy so tied to parental love that it was off putting - I get the desire of children who never experienced love to what to replace their parents, but this takes it to a whole new level.You reading this book and you realize that this person is mentally coming of a child without any real understanding of what adult relationships should be or how families should interact with each other and it is really hard to get past the damage that has already been done to truly enjoy the story.Another reviewer commented on the male characters basically being window dressing, presented as one dimension props for the story. Which aside from John, the only male character who acted with any form of agency of his own, that\u2019s something I found to be true. I feel like if your gonna have characters present for the large majority of the story, have the be secondary characters that drive the plot forward, they need to be more the 1 dimensional troupes.Light spoilers about the ending ahead:I feel like the main Camille needed to be less outside of the norm to be relatable, is it common for a child who was never allowed to be one to assign other adults parental roles, sure. But this takes that to the extreme, making it a unsatisfying ending to what is a roller coaster of trauma. It just doesn\u2019t feel like a win or a loss, just more of the same.I wouldn\u2019t say I enjoyed this book, but I am glad I read it. Generally this is outside of my normal horror genre preferences and I really may have come to this book expecting a lot more from Flynn then she had the ability to give. It is something I do with dramas, reading more into them then was what intended. I just see a bunch of different ways this could have been a more put together story, all of them small tweaks that would have left me more satisfied with the resolution then I was. It\u2019s worth the read, I\u2019m not unset I bought it, I just don\u2019t see a re-read happening.",

I made me more sad than traumatized, but I have to say I still enjoy reading her books, they are real page turners and I like how her characters are flawed but still endearing.",

                "reviewText": "I think I am genuinely addicted to reading, I read such a lot- like \u2018200 books a year \u2018lot\u2019\u2019. Some weeks I can read a book almost daily- much rarer are the weeks when I have read maybe only one or two books. This one I devoured in around 24 hours (a long train journey carved out some guilt free reading time yesterday- and I had to take the afternoon off work today to read some more of this book. Some time after midnight, I had finished it). It was incredibly good- and a long time since I\u2019ve read a book this good. I don\u2019t want to spoil it for the next reader so will just say that I found this book absolutely outstanding- an incredible piece of writing that is still affecting me long after I have read the last word. Parts of it were so well written that I read them twice - just for pleasure- before moving on in the story. That never happens! The character descriptions were so well written and the depiction of the small town American society so beautifully drawn- I felt like these people were real. (It always astounds me when I am so into a book and I look up from the pages- I am shocked to find myself back in my own life.). It was such a great read. I can\u2019t recommend this book enough. In fact - I may have to go back and read it again- I am such a saddo I am missing Camille.I have read the author\u2019s more famous work (Gone Girl) previously but some years ago. I might have to start reading that again.",

                "reviewText": "For context, I had already seen the TV serie (with Amy Adams), so knew what to expect. As I had found it very interesting, I went back to \"the source\", and it was definitly worth it.The characters are really well described, with Camille's trauma emerging little by little in very clear images (or should I say words on her skin ?) ; Adora's and Amma's troubles are presented step by step, with clues clearly present so the end is definitly well prepared. If Adora's trouble is fairly clear from the beginning (though the scope remains to be revealed), Amma playing on her double image - and some of her words to her sister, reveal only progressively the damage.You may sometimes want to shake some \"sense\" into Camille (specially a later chapter), but with her issues her behavior is largely explainable.The last chapters particularly I could not put down, even knowing the end, as the author really made you feel this sickness, this urgency, this decay. I felt torn between deep sadness and disgust for these sick mother/daughter relationships, and the fascination of the excellent description of these relationship.Definitly a book well written and worth reading because of the psychology, just expect to get out of there quite shaken (and in my case, thankful for a healthy relationship with my mother!)\u201cLately, I've been leaning towards kindness.",
