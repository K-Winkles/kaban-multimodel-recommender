                "reviewText": "When my sister chose Nita Prose's The Maid to read for our book club, I thought it was Maid, the novel that became a gritty TV series. Naturally, I was relieved to find out that it wasn't that book. But once I started turning the pages of Prose's debut not-quite-whodunit, my concern returned.Twenty-five-year-old Molly Gray is a maid at a fancy hotel. But she isn't a clock puncher eager to trade her Pledge for party clothes after her shift. Cleaning is Molly's life. She takes unparalleled joy in \"returning rooms to a state of perfection\" and maintains a rigorous home housework schedule in the tenement she shares with her grandmother. Molly and her grandmother are best friends. Actually, Gran is Molly's only friend. Her wisdom, often dispensed as aphorisms, helps Molly navigate the daily challenge of social situations as well as the sometimes not-so-nice (i.e. cruel) colleagues and guests she encounters.So it isn't easy being Molly. And it gets more difficult when she finds a dead body while cleaning the penthouse. What happens next tests everything Molly knows -- and doesn't know -- about how people work. Their characters, their motivations, and their shockingly common tendency to bend the truth. Watching her forge through the forest that is this puzzle is painful, memories of her grandmother and other past moments mingling to reveal the extent of her struggles.Prose's story isn't so much about solving a murder mystery, or even the mystery of Molly herself. It's about understanding -- and ultimately respecting -- people who are different. Because as Gran herself often says, \"We're all the same in different ways.\" By placing Molly in a dangerous situation, Prose magnifies her otherness, rousing our sympathies. But she also shows us that Molly has the rare kind of courage that just might save the day.Poignant and human and sometimes hard to read, The Maid is a metaphor for life's messes. In the end, I was glad we read it for book club.If only as a little reminder that we're each equipped with our own kind of mop.",

                "reviewText": "I thought it was an ok WhoDunnit until the very end, which seemed unnecessary to the story. But then I realized that Molly actually deserved to be in jail because she was an accessory to murder, or at a minimum for obstruction of justice (hiding the pillow, erasing the fingerprints, sending Gizelle out of town, major omissions in her statements to Detective Stark). And she was just fine helping send someone to jail who she knew to be innocent only because she didn't like him. All her life she had had fantasies of vigilante justice towards those who had been unkindly to her. She finally had her opportunity. If those who cared for her had known the truth I don't think they would have stayed so enamoured with her. So, an interesting psychological twist, which all the reviews I have read so far have overlooked.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to love this - so many good reviews from some familiar names. It just wasn't that well written to grab my attention. This is probably the 10th book I've read in the past few years with a main character who is a little different. Normally I like the odd ducks, whether it is because they are somewhere on the spectrum or socially dysfunctional from past trauma, whatever the reason. I can empathize with them easily, and usually enjoy their journey and story. For some reason Molly, although hardworking, sweet and kind, just got on my nerves. I'd get so frustrated with her naivety, I'd have to take a break. Some of the situations just didn't make sense, no matter the excuse. There wasn't much tension in the mystery, it's pretty obvious from the get go what's going on.So moving right along, I wish Ms. Prose well. I hope her next book has a little more teeth to it.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m surprised many reviewers did not seem to understand that Molly is not just a quirky character. She is obviously quite intelligent and, yes, more than a bit odd, but she is also obviously on the autism spectrum with the additional trait of OCD. Every character who comes in contact with her soon realizes that she is \u201cspecial\u201d. Molly often mentions her inability to correctly read and understand other people, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from being the very best she can be\u2014which is quite awesome! Because she has the ability to cut through \u201cthe noise\u201d, tell it like it is with no embellishments, and see the fine details that other people would not notice, she makes a particularly interesting storyteller and witness even though her interpretations are sometimes wrong. This is a great read and is told first person by a lovable character who happens to be on the autism spectrum. You\u2019ll laugh with Molly and be cheering for her every step of the way.",

It's a good reminder that there are people who aren't born cynical and untrusting. The story falls apart a bit as the arrest / court room drama would never happen that way. For instance, Molly wasn't on trial - she was a witness - so why would she have her own attorney cross-examining her.? Only the prosecutor and the defense attorney would have done any questioning. But in the end, it's a cute, feel good story and the good guys win. If you're looking for a simple plot where you don't have to put in a lot of work to read the book, this is a good one.",

                "reviewText": "I found the character to be compelling, and could not stop reading after the first few chapters. Molly is clearly very intelligent, but sees things through a simpler worldview than most others. One of my favorite elements of the book is Molly's evolution from a simplistice right/wrong morality to a more nuanced understanding as she internalizes the lessons from the world around her.Also interesting is that as a reader, I experienced much stronger emotions than Molly herself as it became clear what was happening to her while she did not understand. At the very end, however, it became clear that I had underestimated her just like the other characters in the novel.",

                "reviewText": "The story:Molly the maid takes great satisfaction in her role at the Regency Grand Hotel, returning the guest\u2019s rooms to a state of perfection each day, whatever mess they might have left behind.But what she finds in Suite 401 one day isn\u2019t so easily tidied away. A very important guest is dead, and the police believe it might be more than a heart attack\u2026 There is something messy lurking at the heart of the Regency Grand, and who better to deal with a mess than the maid?My thoughts:Although \u201cThe Maid\u201d, by Nita Prose set in the modern day, Molly is an old-fashioned (or perhaps more accurately, a \u2018proper\u2019) young woman. As she says herself, she doesn\u2019t perceive the world in quite the same way others do, and struggles to deal with people who don\u2019t say what they mean (or mean what they say). She loves and takes great pride in her job as a maid at the up-market Regency Grand Hotel (where I would very much like to stay!), and is diligent and hard-working in applying the training Mr Snow, the hotel manager, has bestowed on her.Despite having passed away several months before the story begins, Molly\u2019s gran is also an important character in the story. Throughout her life she\u2019s guided Molly through a world she doesn\u2019t fully understand, and Molly calls on her memories of her gran\u2019s wisdom and advice to help her make sense of the behaviour of others.When Molly is unlucky enough to discover a body in one of the hotel\u2019s best suites, it soon becomes clear to the reader that Mr Black (who is \u201cvery dead\u201d!) was not a nice man\u2026 In fact, there are a few unpleasant people in this story, and seeing their treatment of the trusting and loyal Molly is enough to make the blood boil\u2026But there are also those who see Molly\u2019s unique characteristics in the positive light they deserve, and it\u2019s great to see them rally round her when Molly herself is brought under suspicion.As well as introducing us to a truly endearing lead character, this book is also a cracking murder mystery \u2014 of all the people who had good reason to hate Mr Black, who is responsible for his death? I\u2019ll leave it to you to find out!",
