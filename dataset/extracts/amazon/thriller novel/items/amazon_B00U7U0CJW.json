        "description": "2016 Audie Award Finalist for Best Male NarratorA masterful, intensely suspenseful novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far - a book about the power of storytelling, starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in Mr. Mercedes. \"Wake up, genius.\" So begins King's instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn't published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel. Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he's released from prison after 35 years. Not since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life - for good, for bad, forever. Read more",

                "reviewText": "Good story line, about a man Morris who is absolutely obsessed with John Rothstein novels- especially his Jimmy Gold trilogy!! But Morris absolutely HATES the way he ended the trilogy\u2026. With Jimmy selling out!This author has since retired and lives with his wife, writing in his journals.. But in these journals are actually sequels to this trilogy, unpublished and for HIS eyes only! What would have been books 4 and 5 of the series, along with about $20,000 cash is stolen from Mr. Rothstein in a home burglary, which turns deadly for him. Who killed him? you guessed it, Morris! So now he has his money, but that $20,000 is nothing compared to what these hidden journals are worth (to the right man willing to buy them on the black market). A friend of his, Andy, tells him that when things die down after this man\u2019s death, then he surely can find someone to purchase these gems!! Only problem is, Morris is now going away for many years, due to convicted rape! So now he must hide his trunk full of journals (and cash ) under a near dead tree behind his old house!Hoping that it\u2019s still there when he gets out\u2026Enter Peter Saubers, teenager in high school, main character of the story. He moves into Morrises old house, and guess what he stumbled upon? You guessed it, The trunk! And he has actually heard of Rothstein, is a huge fan of his work, and happened to love the trilogy! But when he reads these last 2 books, he\u2019s even more amazed ! He now realizes what literal GOLD he has on his hands!Also during all of this his parents are having financial (even some marital) problems, and so Pete starts anonymously sending random letters to his house addressed to his father, with mystery money in it, and does so for almost 2 years\u2026 until, one day\u2026\u2026 it runs out and he sends his last envelope!Well it certainly did help his parents get back on their feet, and almost certainly saved their marriage! Which is good, but what kind of sucks, is now Morris is out of prison, and will be looking for all his things, but Peter doesn\u2019t know this\u2026\u2026 yet..Now he is looking for more money (not so much for his parents now) but for his younger sister he wants to be able to help put her into this nice school, but it\u2019s a bit expensive. So he decides to do the unthinkable- part with some of his journals- and he KNOWS what he has, could potentially be looking at a million dollars!So he goes to the shadiest Rare Books Dealer in town, Andy Halliday! (Yep, Morrises old pal from right after the heist, who most certainly knows people who can afford so buy these VERY RARE finds). Peter knows he cannot go to just anyone- most people who knows what he has is Stolen property from a murder case, and will think Peter had something to do with it! So no police! So it\u2019s Andy, or nobody!Except Andy was wandering where these journals went after Morris went into prison, and now he knows where they are! He attempts to blackmail Pete into either lowballing him EXTREMELY, or getting the police on the phone!But before he can continue with his plan, Morris comes in to save the day- and KILL Andy. Hey, what are friends for, right? So now all Morris has to do is rid himself of Peter, but not a second before he knows where these journals are ! Will he eventually come back into possession of these last 2 Jimmy Gold Novels? Or will he die trying?Tune in next week, for the conclusion of :FINDERS KEEPERS!\u2026he dies\u2026. Peter burns the books while Morris stands aflame burning together with his one true love: Jimmy Gold at last !Great storyline, a bit of a jump from the Brady Hartsfield from the First book, but Brady certainly doesn\u2019t disappoint in the third!9.5/10 stars for me!",

The family is in deep financial trouble and it is causing a lot of fights. Then Pete finds a trunk that was buried under a tree. The trunk contained cash and moleskin notebooks with unpublished works by John Rothstein, 2 of which continue his trilogy of books starring Jimmy Gold. He keeps the moleskin notebooks, reading them in secret, and mails his parents potions of the money every month or so, anonymously, until the money finally runs out.This \u201chaul\u201d was stolen and John Rothstein was murdered by petty criminal Morris Bellamy. Morris has been incarcerated since the robbery for a drunken rape after he had tried to approach his \u201cfriend\u201d Andrew, to sell the notebooks and was rejected and was advised by him to hide them.37 years later, the money is gone and Peter\u2019s sister wants to attend a private school, and Morris is out of prison. Peter chooses the wrong bookseller to approach to sell the notebooks, Morris\u2019s friend Andrew. And Morris finding the notebooks missing from his hiding place, seeks out Andrew as the only person who knew he was hiding them.",

                "reviewText": "After reading Holly, I\u2019ve gone back to read the Bill Hodges trilogy. I\u2019ve just finished book two, Finders Keepers. I\u2019m binge reading them so it\u2019s been a seamless time spent with Bill, Holly, Jerome and his sister Barb, and now introducing Peter and his sister Tina who is Barb\u2019s BFF. Creepily, Brady Hartsfield, Mr. Mercedes, makes a comeback role as well\u2014but more on him later. Pete is the main deal in Finders Keepers, as he finds buried treasure (literally) behind his house in the form of a trunk filled with random moleskin journals of unpublished stories written by John Rothstein about the fictional adventures of Jimmy Gold, his award-winning character introduced in several books met with high praise and literary criticism decades earlier. After publication of these early books Rothstein disappeared in J.D. Salinger fashion, making his books cult favorites and Jimmy Gold a cult hero. There were rumors of more manuscripts stolen in a break-in at Rothstein\u2019s home in the 1970s, where he was also murdered, but none appeared. The murderer and thief, Morris Bellamy, buried the manuscripts and some cash in a trunk behind a home in which he lived and promptly landed himself in prison in a blackout fueled life sentence. Such irony, but not, because this is the house Peter lives in today. And so the story begins. One great phrase (and there are many) King introduces in Peter\u2019s house is \u201carkie-barkie\u201d what the kids call it when their parents argue. Perfect. I mentioned Mr. Mercedes, Brady Hartsfield, comes back in Finders Keepers. When we left him in Mr. Mercedes, Holly had rendered him into a coma with Hodges\u2019 Happy Slapper, another one of my favorites \u2014a sock knotted with ball bearings at the bottom. But in King-like fashion, oh no, Brady makes awake type moves when Hodges visits someone at the hospital and looks in on him. A photo of Brady and his mother moves and Hodges is convinced Brady is faking. But, oh wait until the end and you get treated to some real Stephen King horror when Brady shows Hodges, and the reader, what\u2019s really going on. Please, oh please, let it continue to End of Watch where I travel to next!",
