As in, she actually lost him\u2014he walked out on her and she has no idea where he is. But in her remote village in India, rumor has it that Geeta killed him. And it\u2019s a rumor that just won\u2019t die.It turns out that being known as a \u201cself-made\u201d widow comes with some perks. No one messes with her, harasses her, or tries to control (ahem, marry) her. It\u2019s even been good for business; no one dares to not buy her jewelry.Freedom must look good on Geeta, because now other women are asking for her\u201cexpertise,\u201d making her an unwitting consultant for husband disposal.And not all of them are asking nicely.With Geeta\u2019s dangerous reputation becoming a double-edged sword, she has to find a way to protect the life she\u2019s built\u2014but even the best-laid plans of would-be widows tend to go awry. What happens next sets in motion a chain of events that will change everything, not just for Geeta, but for all the women in their village.Filled with clever criminals, second chances, and wry and witty women, Parini Shroff\u2019s The Bandit Queens is a razor-sharp debut of humor and heart that readers won\u2019t soon forget.

They come to her for advice and help on how to kill their husbands. She helps Farah kill Samir, her husband. She also helps the twins get rid of one of their husbands. She and Karem, the local barkeep, start to keep company with each other. But what would happen if the village found out Geeta was telling the truth?I found this slow starting but once I got into it, I howled it was so funny. These ladies lay down the truth left and right. Geeta was probably the most serious one of the group. She is an idealist. When she learns the truth of her wedding, she loses it big time. She does not trust herself but reigns it in. She knew something was wrong. When it all comes to a head at the end, the last big scene is farcical. I laughed so hard. Everyone got what they deserved. I loved that the women banded together. It was great watching them become one unit.This is a keeper. It so much fun by the end.",

After realizing the benefits that come along with people believing you killed your husband, Geeta stopped trying to convince the town of her innocence instead taking advantage of the offered perks. That is until other women in the village come to Geeta to take care of their problems too. How far will Geeta go to protect her secret and the life she\u2019s built?\u2728\u2728Shroff has written an entertaining and insightful novel. I was surprised at how well Shroff balanced dark humor with the heavier topics surrounding women\u2019s lives discussed in The Bandit Queens. It was done in such a way that the book overall didn\u2019t veer to far toward either direction. Although, I do feel that the ending sequence went a little too far into the humor side of things. It was interesting to see how the women in the loan group interacted with each other and how their relationships changed throughout the course of the story particularly between Geeta, Farrah, and Saloni. The different circumstances they found themselves in forced the women to reevaluate their relationships and the difficulties that lead them to where they were in life. One of the more poignant elements of the story came when Geeta had to learn that the consequences of her taking a stand fall on the individual she\u2019s advocating for rather than herself. Overall, the story was well worth the read.",

I learned a lot about Indian culture and the oppression of women through Shroff's carefully crafted characters and descriptive scenes. There were a lot of Indian words I didn't know, but Shroff strategically uses context to bring the reader into the Bandit Queens world. Plus, because I read on my tablet, I was able to use the look up feature, which was helpful - most of the time. I was so enthralled with the women characters in this book that I couldn't wait to get to the point in my day when I could read more. Their nuanced friendships and support for one another was inspiring. I can't wait for anther book from Parini Shroff!",

At times, especially in the middle, the book dragged for me and I considered it for DNF. But I carried on because Geeta, the protagonist, was evolving as a woman becoming enlightened and powerful in a culture that denies women the basic rights of humanity. That a legend of a woman was her strength; Phoolan, inspired me as well.I stumbled with language, Farsi? terms, Hindu Rites & Celebrations, and caste culture specifics. But pushed on again because of Geeta.I also read this during Diwali, so that enhanced my interest.I will be in the lookout for this author's next book.",

                "reviewText": "This is mostly about the maltreatment of women in India by their husbands and their bid for a better life. It takes place in a small village, where several women belong to a \"microloan\" group. They mostly use the money to finance their cottage industry type work, but in making payments on the loan, they use up most of the money they make and remain under their abusive husbands' control. The husband of the main character, Geeta, disappeared five years ago, and the rumor is that she killed him. She did not, but based on the rumor, her friends ask for help with their husbands. I thought the story was intriguing and a good insight into life for women in India. I guess my main problem with it is that some of the story is sort of unbelievable. There is a lot of profanity in the book, which is o.k., and also a lot of Hindi words which are not explained or defined by context in some cases.",

                "reviewTitle": "Dark humour and great characters",
                "reviewText": "The Bandit Queens is a darkly comic tale of women getting the upper hand over their useless, and often abusive husbands.Geeta's husband Ramesh disappeared five years ago. Gossip has it that Geeta did away with him, a rumour she doesn't deny as a fearsome reputation is useful to keep her safe in rural India. It does also means she is generally ostracised, until that is, one of the women in her loan group approaches Geeta for help in getting rid of her own husband.It's a pretty dark tale, set in a place where women are second class citizens, effectively the property of the men they marry, mere baby-making machines and servants to be beaten into submission. The humour is black as night and lifts the story when its very real themes of subjugation and powerlessness get heavy, transforming it into a page turning feminist revenge thriller.That isn't to say that all the men are bad and all the women are saints though. The characterisation is far more realistic than that. The women are often judgemental, bitchy and cliquey, although there is a sisterhood that bonds them. And yes, most of the men are violent or drunkards or both, but they aren't all depicted as feckless and evil, although the best that can be said of one of the better husbands is the dismissive comment \"I mean, Zubin snores, but you learn to live with it.\u201dThe Bandit Queens is a fabulous debut, that makes you rage and laugh and above all, root for this remarkable group of women.",

The character development is fantastic, and each character has complexities which makes the story all the more interesting. Keeping this book forever!",
