Joe isn\u2019t clear about what the governor expects because the murderer\u2014a cagey local lawyer\u2014confessed but could not be prosecuted due to a weird jurisdictional glitch. What Joe begins to suspect is that nothing is as it seems, as murders continue to occur around him and he himself is under threat. Amid the nail-biting tension, the author provides breathtaking descriptions of the staggering beauty and mystery of the most famous national park in America, and possibly the world, that will make you want to book a reservation tomorrow. And CJ Box doesn\u2019t skimp on the descriptions of the abundant animal life either. So it\u2019s really like 2 books\u2014thrilling murder mystery and vibrant travel guide\u2014perfectly blended together. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Best of the series so far!!Joe is made an offer he can't refuse from the Governor of Wyoming. He's to be reinstated as a game warden, but he'll be working on behalf of the Governor's office investigating a mass murder that took place several months earlier. Four activists are killed in what is referred to as \"The Zone of Death,\" a desolate part of Yellowstone that doesn't fall under any governmental laws. Thus, the killer gets away with murder. Joe is to report back to the Governor his findings. Well, when Joe gets involved in anything, it usually plays out about the same as whenever Virgil Flowers gets involved in anything. Suffice it to stay, you will be glued to the pages. More unsavory characters than you can count, and some new ones that you'll love. And of course, Nate is there to help Joe out.The descriptions of nature up there in Yellowstone late in the season sound absolutely mesmerizing. Box can really put you right into the world you're reading about. Joe has a child-like fascination with the place, which is palpable to the reader. I had to google some of what was in the book because it sounded so stunning. That, along with the a gripping mystery, made this book one that you will rush right through. I'll be interested to see how the dust settles after this one.",

                "reviewText": "This Joe Pickett tale is set entirely in Yellowstone Park, where previously unemployed Joe is hired by the governor of Wyoming on a secret mission of sorts. A Lone Ranger mission\u2026all by himself, though he enlists the help of his ultra cool badass Buddy Nate Romanowski. (Very cool character! He, and Joe\u2019s immediate family, make the series, imo). This book has very little time spent on Joe\u2019s family, which I found a tad disappointing.Joe is there in Yellowstone to see what\u2019s going on. The gov\u2019ner received an appealing letter from a citizen who says something huge and potentially lucrative is showing up in Yellowstone, come see! The gov sends Joe, \u201cBut I will deny it if you say so!\u201d It\u2019s a rather dangerous mission for Joe, and Nate, and as usual it\u2019s hard to know who the good guys are, and who is a bad guy. I admit to losing track of all the characters in this tale. I was mostly listening to it when I drove, and a couple of times I went a day or 2 without reading or listening, and forgot some of the characters. I love Kindle\u2019s search feature for refreshing my memory, but there was one character I never did remember how he fit in. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal in the end, I still got the gist of the story.It was a good story, made better by the note at the end that told me the issues addressed in this story were, in fact, true issues in the state of Wyoming at the time the book was written. That tidbit was encouraging and gave me even more respect for the author.So I\u2019m ready for the next book in the series. Joe Pickett left a few things hanging, and I need to see how he takes care of it all.",

                "reviewText": "The title of this novel had me a little puzzled, because I couldn't figure out the title reference. So I decided I'd give Mr. Box a chance to tell me!Game Warden Joe Pickett, is sent by Gov, Rulon to do some undercover investigation in beautiful Yellowstone Park. It seems that the four campers/employees of Yellowstone Park are brutally murdered while enjoying a camp out and a kind of reunion. They have been shot down while still sleeping in their tent and sleeping bags. It's a mystery that no one seems to understand or reason why. Therefore, the Governor sends his \"Range Rider\", Joe Pickett to see what he can find out, however,undercover, unassisted, and absolutely hush-hush (without any knowledge of the Governor's involvement ).It happens that the murders took place in a very remote area of Yellowstone which also spills over into Idaho, and is in an area known as the Zone of Death. It gets a bit complicated with the laws that exist in a national park such as Yellowstone so you will have to find that out for yourself!Box's writing skills have improved by leaps and bounds, especially his storylines, the way he puts things together, and makes everything fit into a tightly woven, mind bending, ever moving suspense drama that simply blows you away.As the story evolves, more murders take place in the Zone of Death area, and everyone knows who the murderer is, but because of the area where the crimes are committed; the killer cannot be touched by the arm of the law.Yes folks, Joe has his work cut out for him.I would have given my review 5 stars (which it really deserves), but to me, I'd like to see a little more closeness with his wife and family. However, in this novel it seems that Mr. Box is nudging a little closer to that regard.I loved this book and couldn't seem to put it down. My dishes were piling up in the sink and my loving husband was giving me some sly looks!! Do yourself a favor and treat yourself with this great gripping read. It will amaze you.",
