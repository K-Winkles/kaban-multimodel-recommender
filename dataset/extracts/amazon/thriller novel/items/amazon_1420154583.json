                "reviewText": "This is a gothic mystery with an creepy atmosphere and some very secretive characters. Baineworth Manor is the perfect setting for this book, on an island that is accessible only by one bridge that may or may not be safe to cross depending on the weather. The sheriff, a man named Deacon, who was featured prominently in a previous book, becomes almost a secondary character in this one as Dr. Elijah Cooke, the manager of the manor, and Edie Stone, a determined reporter, come front and center in this third book of the trilogy. After reading the first two books, I had no idea that there were so many secrets left to be revealed, but there were a multitude of them. Dr. Cooke is protecting his own reputation and that of the manor by refusing to cooperate with Edie but as she begins to unravel the truth, both of their lives are endangered. There is a touch of romance here but most of the book is centered around Edie\u2019s quest for the truth about the young women who disappeared at the manor, their horrific treatment that bordered on Nazi tactics of mind control and the babies that they supposedly had who also disappeared. I did not feel close to any of the characters but I did feel empathy for Edie and for the ladies at the B & B, one of whom was a \u201cguest\u201d at the manor and her mind was irrevocably damaged because of her stay there and the loss of her baby. There are a lot of twists and turns, several switchbacks and more than a few red herrings thrown out there to keep me engaged and interested in finishing the book. I enjoyed the methodical and persuasive way that Edie went about her investigation, but I must say that I was a little disappointed that everything was not totally explained by the end of the book. However, I am delighted that another book is coming, so I look forward to more revelations in that one. The thrills were real, the chills were uncomfortably realistic and the characters were so well portrayed that I found myself giving them advice based on the clues that I was following as I read. This book can be read as a standalone but I think the entire trilogy should be enjoyed as they all tell one fantastic story of a man and his experiments that went out of control and affected an entire community. I will warn other readers that there are some disturbing scenes as well as references to abuse and violence against women, so if that is a trigger for you, then this book may not be for you. Since I have no such triggers, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute that I spent with this dynamic and brilliantly written novel.DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from Kensington via Netgalley and also an autographed copy from the author via KBS Consultant.

Have not read the first two in this series but intend to do so in short order. Won the book but unfortunately cannot post a photo as requested, do not have that capability. Not a subscriber to most social media platforms which is my own choosing. Did enjoy even though this was not my normal preference in reading material. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",
