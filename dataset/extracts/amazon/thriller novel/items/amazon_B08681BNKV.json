Its own kind of masterpiece.\" --Maureen Corrigan, The Washington Post\"A new Tana French is always cause for celebration . . . Read it once for the plot; read it again for the beauty and subtlety of French's writing.\" --Sarah Lyall, The New York TimesCal Hooper thought a fixer-upper in a bucolic Irish village would be the perfect escape. After twenty-five years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens. But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing arm-twists him into investigating, Cal uncovers layers of darkness beneath his picturesque retreat, and starts to realize that even small towns shelter dangerous secrets.\"One of the greatest crime novelists writing today\" (Vox) weaves a masterful, atmospheric tale of suspense, asking how to tell right from wrong in a world where neither is simple, and what we stake on that decision.

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars For What Is He Searching?",
                "reviewText": "The searcher in this Tana French story is a recently-divorced, recently-retired Chicago cop who has bought a small farmhouse with a patch of land near a very rural village in Ireland. Why? Because it's isolated and he really does want to get away from the life he had--you might say he was searching for what he wanted the rest of his life to be.The old farmhouse is structurally sound but a total mess. Everything has to be redone, from electrical to plumbing, to wallpaper and paint. He has virtually no furniture and is starting from scratch to build that new life.The writing of every novel is a combination of character, place, plot, and context. Who are these people, where are they, why are they where they are, and why are they doing the stuff they do. So the author has to balance color, or motivation, with plot movement.In \"The Searcher,\" Tana French has focused more on background and color than plot movement. As a result, although it's a great story, we're much more involved with learning the who and why than we are in the what.While our protagonist, Cal Hooper, is focused on stripping wallpaper and refinishing an old desk, what he assumes is a young teenage boy appears at his cottage. He enlists the help of the boy, Trey, on his project as much to engage him as anything.It turns out the boy has something on his mind, and is looking for help. Word has gotten around that Cal is an ex-cop, and the kid, Trey, has a mystery for which he's seeking answers. Trey's older (19) brother has gone missing. One day he was there, and the next he wasn't. Trey is searching for answers and wants Cal's help.What unravels is the story of how Cal at first rejects Trey's pleas for help, but finally agrees. Almost immediately, Cal starts getting pushback from the community, and most specifically from his closest neighbor. Without saying it directly, they're saying, \"Leave is alone.\"Along the way there are surprises, as one would expect, that I'm not going to reveal to you. That'd spoil your fun in learning for yourself. You'll have to read it for yourself to see.As I said previously, Tana French has focused on character and place development, but she does it masterfully. You grow to like and hate the characters for who and what they are, as they move through the storyline to its conclusion. You'll like Cal, our protagonist, but not too much. He's no Superman--he's flesh and blood with foibles like other humans. He makes mistakes, and sometimes he's unsure of what he should do--unsure of what is \"right\" and what isn't.In the end, I'm glad I read The Searcher. I think you will be, too.",

                "reviewText": "I think the problem that Tana French poses to us in \u201cThe Searcher\u201d is a very difficult one. She asks how people living in local societies should face the dark side of that society and deal with it, when they become aware of it. \u201cThe Searcher\u201d is neither a story of finding a missing person nor a story of solving a case. Former Chicago cop Cal Hooper is trying to find some peace of mind by escaping city life and renovating a shabby house in the Irish countryside. The place was a small mountain village that could never be called wealthy. Just as he\u2019s getting used to his meddlesome neighbor Mart and the local community, a young boy, self-proclaimed Trey, appears before Cal. He asks Cal to find his missing brother. Cal later learned that Trey\u2019s family was in abject poverty and seemed to be alienated from the local community. As the story progresses, the events that led to Cal\u2019s divorce and hatred of being cops are gradually told, revealing his current state of mind. Tana French prepared two big surprise for the reader. The first surprise is that the boy who asked to search for his brother was actually a girl. Another is that Cal\u2019s neighbor Mart was directly involved in the disappearance.At the beginning, Cal witnesses rooks preying on small animals, but he leaves them alone, knowing that the rooks have lived here longer than Cal. This episode sums up the content of this story. The missing boy was already dead. The boy was caught by the locals as he was trying to manufacture drugs to trade with drug dealers from outside in hope of getting rich quick, and he died after a brawl. It\u2019s an unintentional but outright murder. To the adults in the community, his behavior was insane and had to be stopped before it negatively impacted other young people. Unfortunately, it ended in an accidental murder. I can understand Mart\u2019s heartbreaking appeal that he doesn\u2019t want the place to continue to be deserted and that more and more young people are deprived of their future. But society covering up murders and pretending they never happened is another matter. Knowing what happened, Cal considered the option of reporting to the police, but decided to accept everything and continue living here. Cal\u2019s new mission is to watch the Trey grow into an adult facing her. Finally, it is impressive to see Cal and Trey silently repairing household goods as if nothing had happened.",
