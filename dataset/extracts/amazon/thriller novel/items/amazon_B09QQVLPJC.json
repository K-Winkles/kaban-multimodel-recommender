When I finally picked it up, I was so happy that I did. It was a thrill ride. There were twists and turns that made me wanted to keep reading. Some you saw coming, but it still kept my attention. I don't want to give too much away, so here is the nutshell version.When Margot Davies was six years old, her friend from across the street January was murdered. January's Mother, Father and 9 year old brother were all under suspicion that someone in that house either knew who murdered January, or one of them did it. Her murderer was never brought to justice. Margot moved on with her life as most of the townspeople did.When Margot needed to return home to care for her ailing Uncle, news breaks that 5 year old Natalie Clark, who had been missing, body was found. Two young girls murdered in the same small Indiana town?? Margot decides she is going to find out who killed Natalie and January and bring them to justice.This one had an ending that you either loved or hated\u2026 I was team LOVE!! I definitely recommend this one.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to rate this higher. I was absolutely giving it four stars until the very last page. This book is very well written overall. It reads very quickly, clearly, and makes you want to keep going every time a chapter ends. There are lots of twists and most if not all of them make sense, some even made me want to start the book over so I could see how I missed some of the connections.The subject matter is dark. Very dark. This one is not for the faint of heart. There\u2019s no real gore, but there\u2019s violence involving children, especially near the very end, that won\u2019t sit well with some people.Regardless of all of this, I was still enjoying it overall until it abruptly ended. The book answers most of the questions it asks but leaves such an important part of the plot unresolved that I can\u2019t accept it as a reader. I hate open endings, personally. I\u2019d rather not read a story at all if it doesn\u2019t have a clear ending. Perhaps the author who typically works with true crime, was trying to take a page from reality where there aren\u2019t necessarily happy endings, but this ending choice felt like a middle finger to the reader, and took away from what was overall a very solid novel.",

I listen to her podcast every Monday morning\u2026 and I was so excited when this book came out - the story line is familiar because it has remnants of a very popular 90s true crime case. Overall it was well written - I love dual timelines - BUT and I say this with a capital B-U-T the ending! I have so many questions\u2026 kept me guessing till the end but I feel as if another chapter was needed to tie loose ends. Like maybe another chapter that fast forwarded to a couple months or years later. But if you enjoy a good read, and a good mystery, read this book, but just know that you may have questions.",

For Ashley's first book, I'm insanely impressed. That ending though... Mind-blowing. I'm really hoping it leads to a sequel? And maybe a bit of small-town romance for Margot?? Either way, I was hooked from the beginning.",

Leider noch nicht - aber ich hoffe, sie bleibt beim Romane schreiben!Wirklich eine gut durchdachte Story mit glaubhaften Charakteren und vielen \u00dcberraschungsmomenten. Ich bin gespannt, wie es ausgeht!",
