Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. one Pip knew where they lived. Everyone in Fairview knew where they lived. Their home was like the town\u2019s own haunted house; people\u2019s footsteps quickened as they walked by, and their words strangled and died in their throats. Shrieking children would gather on their walk home from school, daring one another to run up and touch the front gate. But it wasn\u2019t haunted by ghosts, just three sad people trying to live their lives as before. A house not haunted by flickering lights or spectral falling chairs, but by dark spray-\u00adpainted letters of \u201cScum Family\u201d and stone-\u00adshattered windows. Pip had always wondered why they didn\u2019t move. Not that they had to; they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. But she didn\u2019t know how they lived like that. How the Singhs found the strength to stay here. Here, in Fairview, under the weight of so many widened eyes, of the comments whispered just loud enough to be heard, of neighborly small talk never stretching into real talk anymore. It was a particular cruelty that their house was so close to Fairview High School, where both Andie Bell and Sal Singh had gone, where Pip would return for her senior year in a few weeks when the late-\u00adsummer sun dipped into September. Pip stopped and rested her hand on the front gate, instantly braver than half the town\u2019s kids. Her eyes traced the path to the front door. It was possible that this was a very bad idea; she had considered that. Pausing for just a second, Pip held her breath, then pushed the creaking gate and crossed the yard. She stopped at the door and knocked three times. Her reflection stared back at her: the long dark hair sun-\u00adbleached a lighter brown at the tips, the pale white skin despite a week just spent in the Caribbean, the sharp muddy-\u00adgreen eyes braced for impact. The door opened with the clatter of a falling chain and clicking locks. \u201cH-\u00adhello?\u201d he said, holding the door half open, with his hand folded over the side. Pip blinked to break her stare, but she couldn\u2019t help it. He looked so much like Sal: the Sal she knew from all those television reports and newspaper pictures. The Sal now fading from her memory. Ravi had his brother\u2019s messy black side-swept hair, thick arched eyebrows, and oaken-\u00adhued skin. \u201cHello?\u201d he said again. \u201cUm . . .\u201d Pip faltered. He\u2019d grown even taller since she last saw him. She\u2019d never been this close before, but now that she was, she saw he had a dimple in his chin, just like hers. \u201cUm, sorry, hi.\u201d She did an awkward half wave that she immediately regretted. \u201cHi?\u201d\u201cHi, Ravi,\u201d she said. \u201cI . . . You don\u2019t know me. . . . I\u2019m Pippa Fitz-\u00adAmobi. I was a few years below you at school before you left.\u201d \u201cOK . . .\u201d \u201cI was just wondering if I could borrow a second of your time? Well, not only a second, we\u2019re already way past that. . . . Maybe like a few sequential seconds, if you can spare them?\u201d Oh god, this was what happened when she was nervous: words spewed out, unchecked and overexplained, until someone stopped her.Ravi looked confused. \u201cSorry,\u201d Pip said, recovering. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m doing my senior capstone project at school and\u2014\u00ad\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a capstone project?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a senior thesis you work on independently, alongside normal classes. You can pick any topic you want, and I was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to be interviewed for mine.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d His dark eyebrows hugged closer to his eyes. \u201cUm . . . it\u2019s about what happened five years ago.\u201d Ravi exhaled loudly, his lip curling with what looked like anger. \u201cWhy?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think your brother did it\u2014\u00adand I\u2019m going to try to prove it.\u201d Pippa Fitz-\u00adAmobi 7/30/19 Capstone Project Log\u2014\u00adEntry 1 Our capstone project logs are supposed to be for recording any obstacles we face in our research; our progress; and the aims of our final reports. Mine will have to be a little different: I\u2019m going to record all my research here, both relevant and irrelevant, because I don\u2019t really know what my final report will be yet or what will end up being important. I will just have to wait and see where I\u2019m at after all my investigating and what essay I can bring together.I\u2019m hoping it will not be the topic I proposed to Mrs. Morgan. I\u2019m hoping it will be the truth. What really happened to Andie Bell on April 18, 2014? And if\u2014\u00adas my instincts tell me\u2014Salil \u201cSal\u201d Singh is not guilty, then who killed her? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll actually solve the case and figure out who murdered Andie. I\u2019m not deluded. But I\u2019m hoping my findings might lead to reasonable doubt about Sal\u2019s guilt, and suggest that the police were mistaken in closing the case without digging further. The first stage in this project is to research what happened to Andrea Bell\u2014\u00adknown to everyone as Andie\u2014\u00adand the circumstances surrounding her disappearance. From the first national online news outlet to report on the event: Andrea Bell, seventeen, was reported missing from her home in Fairview, Connecticut, last Friday.She left home in her car\u2014\u00ada white Honda Civic\u2014\u00adwith her cell phone, but did not take any clothes with her. Police say her disappearance is \u201ccompletely out of character.\u201d Police began searching the woodland near the family home this past weekend. Andrea, known as Andie, is described as white, five feet six inches tall, with long blond hair and blue eyes. It is thought that she was wearing dark jeans and a blue cropped sweater on the night she went missing.1 Other sources had more details as to when Andie was last seen alive, and the time frame in which she is believed to have been abducted. Andie Bell was \u201clast seen alive by her younger sister, Becca, around 10:30 p.m. on April 18, 2014.\u201d2This was corroborated by the police in a press conference on Tuesday, April 22: \u201cFootage taken from a security camera outside the bank on Fairview\u2019s Main Street confirms that Andie\u2019s car was seen driving away from her home at about 10:40 p.m.\u201d3According to her parents, Jason and Dawn Bell, Andie was \u201csupposed to pick (them) up from a dinner party at 12:45 a.m.\u201d When Andie didn\u2019t show up or answer any of their phone calls, they started reaching out to her friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts. Jason Bell \u201ccalled the police to report his daughter missing at 3:00 a.m. Saturday morning.\u201d4 So whatever happened to Andie Bell that night happened between 10:40 p.m. and 12:45 a.m. Here seems like a good place to type up the transcript from my interview with Angela Johnson. Transcript of interview with Angela Johnson from the Missing Persons Bureau Angela: Hello. Pip: Hi, is this Angela Johnson? Angela: Speaking, yep. Is this Pippa? Pip: Yes, thanks so much for replying to my email. Do you mind if I record this interview for my project? Angela: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve only got about ten minutes. So what do you want to know about missing persons?Pip: Well, I was wondering if you could talk me through what happens when someone is reported missing? What\u2019s the process and the first steps taken by the police? Angela: When someone is reported missing, the police will try to get as much detail as possible so they can identify the potential risk to the missing person, and an appropriate police response can be made. They\u2019ll ask for name, age, description, the clothes they were last seen wearing, the circumstances of their disappearance, if going missing is out of character for this person, details of any vehicle involved. Using this information, the police will determine whether this is an at-\u00adrisk missing persons case. Pip: And what circumstances would make it an at-\u00adrisk case? Angela: If they are vulnerable because of their age or a disability, or if the behavior is out of character, which indicates they could have been exposed to harm. Pip: Um, so, if the missing person is seventeen years old and it is deemed out of character for her to go missing, would that be considered an at-\u00adrisk case? Angela: Absolutely, when a minor is involved. Pip: So how would the police respond? Angela: Well, there would be immediate deployment of police officers to the location the person is missing from. The officers will get further information about the missing person, such as details of their friends or partners; any health conditions; financial information, in case they try to withdraw money. Police will also need recent photographs and might take DNA samples, in case they\u2019re needed in subsequent forensic examinations. And, with consent of the homeowners, the location would be searched thoroughly to see if the missing person is concealed or hiding there and to establish whether there are any further evidential leads. Pip: So immediately the police are looking for any clues or suggestions that the missing person has been the victim of a crime? Angela: Absolutely. If the circumstances of the disappearance are suspicious, officers are instructed to document evidence early on, as though they were investigating a murder. Of course, only a very small percentage of missing persons cases turn into homicide cases. Pip: And what happens if nothing significant turns up after the initial home search? Angela: They\u2019ll expand the search to the immediate area. They\u2019ll question friends, neighbors, anyone who might have relevant information. If it is a teenager who\u2019s missing, we can\u2019t assume the reporting parent knows all of their child\u2019s friends and acquaintances. Peers are good points of contact to establish other important leads\u2014\u00adyou know, any secret boyfriends, that sort of thing. And a press strategy is usually discussed because appeals for information in the media can be very useful in these situations. Pip: So if it\u2019s a seventeen-\u00adyear-\u00adold girl who\u2019s gone missing, the police would contact her friends and boyfriend early on? Angela: Yes, of course. Inquiries will be made, because if the missing person has run away, they are likely to be hiding out with someone close to them. Pip: And at what point in a missing persons case do police assume they are looking for a body? Angela: Well, timewise, it\u2019s not\u2014\u00ad Oh, Pippa, I have to go. Sorry, I\u2019ve been called into my meeting. Pip: Oh, OK, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me. Angela: And if you have more questions, just shoot me an email and I\u2019ll get to it when I can. Pip: Will do, thanks again. I found these statistics: 80% of missing people are found in the first twenty-\u00adfour hours. 97% are found in the first week, and 99% of cases are resolved in the first year. That leaves just 1%. 1% of people who disappear are never found. And just 0.25% of all missing persons cases have a fatal outcome.5 So where does this leave Andie Bell? Floating incessantly somewhere between 1% and 0.25%. Even though Andie has never been found and her body never recovered, most people accept that she is dead. And why is that? Sal Singh is why. two Pip\u2019s hands hovered over the keyboard as she strained to listen to the commotion downstairs. A crash, heavy footsteps, skidding claws, and unrestrained boyish giggles. \u201cJosh! Why is the dog wearing my shirt!\u201d Pip\u2019s dad shouted, the sound floating upstairs. Pip snort-\u00adlaughed as she clicked to save her capstone project log and closed her laptop. It was never quiet once her dad returned from work. Downstairs, Pip found Josh running from room to room\u2014\u00adkitchen to hallway to living room\u2014\u00adon repeat. Cackling as he went. Close behind was Barney, the golden retriever, wearing her dad\u2019s loudest shirt, the blindingly green patterned one he\u2019d bought during their last trip to Nigeria. The dog skidded elatedly across the polished oak in the hall, excitement whistling through his teeth. Bringing up the rear was Pip\u2019s dad in his gray Hugo Boss three-\u00adpiece suit, all six and a half feet of him charging after the dog and the boy, laughing in wild bursts. \u201cOh my god, I was trying to do homework,\u201d Pip said, restraining a smile as she jumped back to avoid being mowed down. Barney stopped for a moment to headbutt her shin and then scampered off to jump on Victor and Josh as they collapsed together on the sofa. \u201cHello, pickle,\u201d her dad said, patting the couch beside him. \u201cHi, Dad. You were so quiet I didn\u2019t even know you were home.\u201d \u201cMy Pipsicle, you are too clever to recycle a joke.\u201dShe sat down beside them. Josh started excavating his right nostril, and Pip\u2019s dad batted his hand away. \u201cHow were your days, then?\u201d her dad asked, setting Josh off on a graphic spiel about the soccer games he\u2019d played earlier. Pip zoned out; she\u2019d already heard it all in the car when she picked Josh up from practice. She\u2019d only been half listening, distracted by the way the replacement coach had stared at her, uncertain, when she\u2019d pointed out which of the nine-\u00adyear-\u00adolds was hers and said: \u201cI\u2019m Josh\u2019s sister.\u201d She should have been used to it by now, the lingering looks while people tried to work out the logistics of her family. Victor, the tall Nigerian man, was evidently her stepfather; and Josh, her half brother. But Pip didn\u2019t like those words, those cold technicalities. The people you love weren\u2019t calculated, subtracted, or held at arm\u2019s length across a decimal point. Victor was her dad, who\u2019d raised her since she was four years old, and Josh was her annoying little brother. Her \u201creal\u201d father, the man who lent the Fitz to her name, died in a car accident when she was ten months old. And though Pip nodded and smiled when her mom would ask whether she remembered the way her father hummed while he brushed his teeth or how he\u2019d laughed when Pip\u2019s second spoken word was \u201cpoo,\u201d she didn\u2019t remember him. But sometimes remembering isn\u2019t for yourself; sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. \u201cAnd how\u2019s the project going, Pip?\u201d Her dad turned to her as he unbuttoned the shirt from the dog. \u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just researching at the moment. I did go to see Ravi Singh this morning, though.\u201d\u201cOh, and . . . ?\u201d \u201cHe was busy, but he said I could go back on Friday.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Josh said in a cautionary tone.\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a judgmental prepubescent boy who still thinks little people live inside traffic lights.\u201d Pip looked at him. \u201cThe Singhs haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201dVictor stepped in. \u201cJosh, try to imagine if everyone judged you because of something your sister had done.\u201d 1 www.ustn.com/news/2014/04/21/local-\u00adteen-\u00admissing, 4/21/142 www.fairfieldctnews.com/fairview/crime-\u00ad4839, 4/24/143 www.ustn.com/news/2014/04/22/missing-\u00adschoolgirl-\u00ad698834, 4/22/144 Forbes, Stanley, 2014, \u201cThe Real Story of Andie Bell\u2019s Killer,\u201d Fairview Mail, 4/29/14, pp. 1\u2013\u00ad4.5 www.missingpersonstats.com Read more"

                "reviewText": "It usually takes me a while to get hooked on a book, but I was in right away.I appreciate the Capstone project entries. It was a great way to relay Pip's investigative findings without feeling unnatural. They also provided a nice format for her interviews so that there could be uninterrupted dialog.This book also had a very charming writing style -- with silly phrasing that just feels good (\"Pip slipped on her not-allowed-to-be-left-in-the-kitchen sneakers, which she\u2019d left in the kitchen, and grabbed the leash.\")I have very few grievances. One being at the very beginning of the book (minor spoiler ahead). Pip mentioned multiple times at the start how unhappy the Singhs must be all the time. Her first extended conversation with Ravi, however, was very light-hearted. He joked, even flirted frequently. Now, she could only make an assumption because before this, she hadn't interacted with the family. She may not pick up on flirtatious comments, but she's very intelligent and I feel she should have mentioned that he was not as emotionally bleak as she expected.Obviously there are things here and there that people could complain about -- stupid decisions characters make that no one in their right mind would in real life -- but this is entertainment, and there was a purpose for this decisions.Wonderful story. I cannot wait to read the second book.",

                "reviewText": "Story ***** World *****Main Characters ***** Side Characters ****Emotions **** Reader Frustration **Romance * Creepiness ***Narration **** Scary *Pros- Pip is smart at seeing the connections and nice- Ravi is sweet and smart and cute- I kept changing my mind on who was guilty. Then at the end it was not what I saw coming. Great twists.- I love it when you never know when the guilty party is going to move something or leave something...creepy- Lots of bad people get what they have coming- Though 20 and 17 I do like the peak at a maybe romance cause I adore RaviCons- Too many times PIP makes dangerous and stupid choices to do things alone when she knows there is a killer, even confronts the killer- I HATE the secret trope and when she doesn't tell her parents or Ravi someone broke into the house it is too far because there are more people involved than her- The amount of time the 20 year old Ravi and the 17 year old Pip spend alone in her room or the fact he keeps coming to see her would be weird for a parent- They make Ravi seem like a teenage boyI read and listened to this book and enjoyed it both ways. The audible is really engaging. I would give it a 4.5 if they had the rating. The reason I gave it a 4 was because of her secretly wandering off alone too often. Otherwise, I spent the entire book just waiting for what would come next. I wish the friend group was a little more developed but the ones that were critical to the story were developed. I will definitely be reading the next book.",

                "reviewText": "So I\u2019m honestly not a big crime and mystery reader. I get scared way too easily and I hate that feeling. This book kept coming up in recommendations as a must read so I took the plunge, turned on all the lights in the house and started on a journey with Pippa to discover just what happened to her town\u2019s teen queen, Andie Bell, one twisted night. This book hooked me right from the beginning and I loved solving the mystery with Pippa!Holly Jackson sure knows how to write a who-dun-it. The details unfolded at such a pace I could barely keep up with them, but I loved rocketing along and never getting bored. I finished this book in 24 hours because I just couldn\u2019t put it down. It\u2019s intense without being too terrifying. I\u2019m glad it was YA to save me from nightmares, lol.Pippa, the MC, was well-written and relatable. She decides to make her senior project at school an effort to solve a 5 year old town murder and throws herself headlong into the investigation from an inside perspective as she personally knows or has connections to the key players. I admired her bravery as a character to go talk to strangers and hostile witnesses who don\u2019t want the past stirred up. I loved that one of the victim\u2019s in the story, Sal, had a brother who joined Pippa to solve the murder. I could have used a little more romance between those two as the flying sparks almost hit me in the eye a couple times! lol!Seriously, this was a fun and wild ride that I totally enjoyed and worth a read!",
