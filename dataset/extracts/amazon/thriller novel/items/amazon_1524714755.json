Chapter One Bronwyn Monday, September 24, 2:55 p.m. A sex tape. A pregnancy scare. Two cheating scandals. And that\u2019s just this week\u2019s update. If all you knew of Bayview High was Simon Kelleher\u2019s gossip app, you\u2019d wonder how anyone found time to go to class. \u201cOld news, Bronwyn,\u201d says a voice over my shoulder. \u201cWait till you see tomorrow\u2019s post.\u201d Damn. I hate getting caught reading About That, especially by its creator. I lower my phone and slam my locker shut. \u201cWhose lives are you ruining next, Simon?\u201d Simon falls into step beside me as I move against the flow of students heading for the exit. \u201cIt\u2019s a public service,\u201d he says with a dismissive wave. \u201cYou tutor Reggie Crawley, don\u2019t you? Wouldn\u2019t you rather know he has a camera in his bedroom?\u201d I don\u2019t bother answering. Me getting anywhere near the bedroom of perpetual stoner Reggie Crawley is about as likely as Simon growing a conscience. \u201cAnyway, they bring it on themselves. If people didn\u2019t lie and cheat, I\u2019d be out of business.\u201d Simon\u2019s cold blue eyes take in my lengthening strides. \u201cWhere are you rushing off to? Covering yourself in extracurricular glory?\u201d I wish. As if to taunt me, an alert crosses my phone: Mathlete practice, 3 p.m., Epoch Coffee. Followed by a text from one of my teammates: Evan\u2019s here. Of course he is. The cute Mathlete--less of an oxymoron than you might think--seems to only ever show up when I can\u2019t. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d I say. As a general rule, and especially lately, I try to give Simon as little information as possible. We push through green metal doors to the back stairwell, a dividing line between the dinginess of the original Bayview High and its bright, airy new wing. Every year more wealthy families get priced out of San Diego and come fifteen miles east to Bayview, expecting that their tax dollars will buy them a nicer school experience than popcorn ceilings and scarred linoleum. Simon\u2019s still on my heels when I reach Mr. Avery\u2019s lab on the third floor, and I half turn with my arms crossed. \u201cDon\u2019t you have someplace to be?\u201d \u201cYeah. Detention,\u201d Simon says, and waits for me to keep walking. When I grasp the knob instead, he bursts out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. You too? What\u2019s your crime?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wrongfully accused,\u201d I mutter, and yank the door open. Three other students are already seated, and I pause to take them in. Not the group I would have predicted. Except one. Nate Macauley tips his chair back and smirks at me. \u201cYou make a wrong turn? This is detention, not student council.\u201d He should know. Nate\u2019s been in trouble since fifth grade, which is right around the time we last spoke. The gossip mill tells me he\u2019s on probation with Bayview\u2019s finest for . . . something. It might be a DUI; it might be drug dealing. He\u2019s a notorious supplier, but my knowledge is purely theoretical. \u201cSave the commentary.\u201d Mr. Avery checks something off on a clipboard and closes the door behind Simon. High arched windows lining the back wall send triangles of afternoon sun splashing across the floor, and faint sounds of football practice float from the field behind the parking lot below. I take a seat as Cooper Clay, who\u2019s palming a crumpled piece of paper like a baseball, whispers \u201cHeads up, Addy\u201d and tosses it toward the girl across from him. Addy Prentiss blinks, smiles uncertainly, and lets the ball drop to the floor. The classroom clock inches toward three, and I follow its progress with a helpless feeling of injustice. I shouldn\u2019t even be here. I should be at Epoch Coffee, flirting awkwardly with Evan Neiman over differential equations. Mr. Avery is a give-detention-first, ask-questions-never kind of guy, but maybe there\u2019s still time to change his mind. I clear my throat and start to raise my hand until I notice Nate\u2019s smirk broadening. \u201cMr. Avery, that wasn\u2019t my phone you found. I don\u2019t know how it got into my bag. This is mine,\u201d I say, brandishing my iPhone in its melon-striped case. Honestly, you\u2019d have to be clueless to bring a phone to Mr. Avery\u2019s lab. He has a strict no-phone policy and spends the first ten minutes of every class rooting through backpacks like he\u2019s head of airline security and we\u2019re all on the watch list. My phone was in my locker, like always. \u201cYou too?\u201d Addy turns to me so quickly, her blond shampoo-ad hair swirls around her shoulders. She must have been surgically removed from her boyfriend in order to show up alone. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my phone either.\u201d \u201cMe three,\u201d Cooper chimes in. His Southern accent makes it sound like thray. He and Addy exchange surprised looks, and I wonder how this is news to them when they\u2019re part of the same clique. Maybe \u00fcberpopular people have better things to talk about than unfair detentions. \u201cSomebody punked us!\u201d Simon leans forward with his elbows on the desk, looking spring-loaded and ready to pounce on fresh gossip. His gaze darts over all four of us, clustered in the middle of the otherwise empty classroom, before settling on Nate. \u201cWhy would anybody want to trap a bunch of students with mostly spotless records in detention? Seems like the sort of thing that, oh, I don\u2019t know, a guy who\u2019s here all the time might do for fun.\u201d I look at Nate, but can\u2019t picture it. Rigging detention sounds like work, and everything about Nate--from his messy dark hair to his ratty leather jacket--screams Can\u2019t be bothered. Or yawns it, maybe. He meets my eyes but doesn\u2019t say a word, just tips his chair back even farther. Another millimeter and he\u2019ll fall right over. Cooper sits up straighter, a frown crossing his Captain America face. \u201cHang on. I thought this was just a mix-up, but if the same thing happened to all of us, it\u2019s somebody\u2019s stupid idea of a prank. And I\u2019m missing baseball practice because of it.\u201d He says it like he\u2019s a heart surgeon being detained from a lifesaving operation. Mr. Avery rolls his eyes. \u201cSave the conspiracy theories for another teacher. I\u2019m not buying it. You all know the rules against bringing phones to class, and you broke them.\u201d He gives Simon an especially sour glance. Teachers know About That exists, but there\u2019s not much they can do to stop it. Simon only uses initials to identify people and never talks openly about school. \u201cNow listen up. You\u2019re here until four. I want each of you to write a five-hundred-word essay on how technology is ruining American high schools. Anyone who can\u2019t follow the rules gets another detention tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhat do we write with?\u201d Addy asks. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any computers here.\u201d Most classrooms have Chromebooks, but Mr. Avery, who looks like he should have retired a decade ago, is a holdout. Mr. Avery crosses to Addy\u2019s desk and taps the corner of a lined yellow notepad. We all have one. \u201cExplore the magic of longhand writing. It\u2019s a lost art.\u201d Addy\u2019s pretty, heart-shaped face is a mask of confusion. \u201cBut how do we know when we\u2019ve reached five hundred words?\u201d \u201cCount,\u201d Mr. Avery replies. His eyes drop to the phone I\u2019m still holding. \u201cAnd hand that over, Miss Rojas.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t the fact that you\u2019re confiscating my phone twice give you pause? Who has two phones?\u201d I ask. Nate grins, so quick I almost miss it. \u201cSeriously, Mr. Avery, somebody was playing a joke on us.\u201d Mr. Avery\u2019s snowy mustache twitches in annoyance, and he extends his hand with a beckoning motion. \u201cPhone, Miss Rojas. Unless you want a return visit.\u201d I give it over with a sigh as he looks disapprovingly at the others. \u201cThe phones I took from the rest of you earlier are in my desk. You\u2019ll get them back after detention.\u201d Addy and Cooper exchange amused glances, probably because their actual phones are safe in their backpacks. Mr. Avery tosses my phone into a drawer and sits behind the teacher\u2019s desk, opening a book as he prepares to ignore us for the next hour. I pull out a pen, tap it against my yellow notepad, and contemplate the assignment. Does Mr. Avery really believe technology is ruining schools? That\u2019s a pretty sweeping statement to make over a few contraband phones. Maybe it\u2019s a trap and he\u2019s looking for us to contradict him instead of agree. I glance at Nate, who\u2019s bent over his notepad writing computers suck over and over in block letters. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m overthinking this. Cooper Monday, September 24, 3:05 p.m. My hand hurts within minutes. It\u2019s pathetic, I guess, but I can\u2019t remember the last time I wrote anything longhand. Plus I\u2019m using my right hand, which never feels natural no matter how many years I\u2019ve done it. My father insisted I learn to write right-handed in second grade after he first saw me pitch. Your left arm\u2019s gold, he told me. Don\u2019t waste it on crap that don\u2019t matter. Which is anything but pitching as far as he\u2019s concerned. That was when he started calling me Cooperstown, like the baseball hall of fame. Nothing like putting a little pressure on an eight-year-old. Simon reaches for his backpack and roots around, unzipping every section. He hoists it onto his lap and peers inside. \u201cWhere the hell\u2019s my water bottle?\u201d \u201cNo talking, Mr. Kelleher,\u201d Mr. Avery says without looking up. \u201cI know, but--my water bottle\u2019s missing. And I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d Mr. Avery points toward the sink at the back of the room, its counter crowded with beakers and petri dishes. \u201cGet yourself a drink. Quietly.\u201d Simon gets up and grabs a cup from a stack on the counter, filling it with water from the tap. He heads back to his seat and puts the cup on his desk, but seems distracted by Nate\u2019s methodical writing. \u201cDude,\u201d he says, kicking his sneaker against the leg of Nate\u2019s desk. \u201cSeriously. Did you put those phones in our backpacks to mess with us?\u201d Now Mr. Avery looks up, frowning. \u201cI said quietly, Mr. Kelleher.\u201d Nate leans back and crosses his arms. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Simon shrugs. \u201cWhy do you do anything? So you\u2019ll have company for whatever your screw-up of the day was?\u201d \u201cOne more word out of either of you and it\u2019s detention tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Avery warns. Simon opens his mouth anyway, but before he can speak there\u2019s the sound of tires squealing and then the crash of two cars hitting each other. Addy gasps and I brace myself against my desk like somebody just rear-ended me. Nate, who looks glad for the interruption, is the first on his feet toward the window. \u201cWho gets into a fender bender in the school parking lot?\u201d he asks. Bronwyn looks at Mr. Avery like she\u2019s asking for permission, and when he gets up from his desk she heads for the window as well. Addy follows her, and I finally unfold myself from my seat. Might as well see what\u2019s going on. I lean against the ledge to look outside, and Simon comes up beside me with a disparaging laugh as he surveys the scene below. Two cars, an old red one and a nondescript gray one, are smashed into each other at a right angle. We all stare at them in silence until Mr. Avery lets out an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019d better make sure no one was hurt.\u201d He runs his eyes over all of us and zeroes in on Bronwyn as the most responsible of the bunch. \u201cMiss Rojas, keep this room contained until I get back.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Bronwyn says, casting a nervous glance toward Nate. We stay at the window, watching the scene below, but before Mr. Avery or another teacher appears outside, both cars start their engines and drive out of the parking lot. \u201cWell, that was anticlimactic,\u201d Simon says. He heads back to his desk and picks up his cup, but instead of sitting he wanders to the front of the room and scans the periodic table of elements poster. He leans out into the hallway like he\u2019s about to leave, but then he turns and raises his cup like he\u2019s toasting us. \u201cAnyone else want some water?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d Addy says, slipping into her chair. \u201cGet it yourself, princess.\u201d Simon smirks. Addy rolls her eyes and stays put while Simon leans against Mr. Avery\u2019s desk. \u201cLiterally, huh? What\u2019ll you do with yourself now that homecoming\u2019s over? Big gap between now and senior prom.\u201d Addy looks at me without answering. I don\u2019t blame her. \u00adSimon\u2019s train of thought almost never goes anywhere good when it comes to our friends. He acts like he\u2019s above caring whether he\u2019s popular, but he was pretty smug when he wound up on the junior prom court last spring. I\u2019m still not sure how he pulled that off, unless he traded keeping secrets for votes. Simon was nowhere to be found on homecoming court last week, though. I was voted king, so maybe I\u2019m next on his list to harass, or whatever the hell he\u2019s doing. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Simon?\u201d I ask, taking a seat next to Addy. Addy and I aren\u2019t close, exactly, but I kind of feel protective of her. She\u2019s been dating my best friend since freshman year, and she\u2019s a sweet girl. Also not the kind of person who knows how to stand up to a guy like Simon who just won\u2019t quit. \u201cShe\u2019s a princess and you\u2019re a jock,\u201d he says. He thrusts his chin toward Bronwyn, then at Nate. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a brain. And you\u2019re a criminal. You\u2019re all walking teen-movie stereotypes.\u201d \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Bronwyn asks. She\u2019s been hovering near the window, but now goes to her desk and perches on top of it. She crosses her legs and pulls her dark ponytail over one shoulder. Something about her is cuter this year. New glasses, maybe? Longer hair? All of a sudden, she\u2019s kind of working this sexy-nerd thing. \u201cI\u2019m the omniscient narrator,\u201d Simon says. Bronwyn\u2019s brows rise above her black frames. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in teen movies.\u201d \u201cAh, but Bronwyn.\u201d Simon winks and chugs his water in one long gulp. \u201cThere is such a thing in life.\u201d He says it like a threat, and I wonder if he\u2019s got something on Bronwyn for that stupid app of his. I hate that thing. Almost all my friends have been on it at one point or another, and sometimes it causes real problems. My buddy Luis and his girlfriend broke up because of something Simon wrote. Though it was a true story about Luis hooking up with his girlfriend\u2019s cousin. But still. That stuff doesn\u2019t have to be published. Hallway gossip is bad enough. And if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m pretty freaked at what Simon could write about me if he put his mind to it. Simon holds his cup up, grimacing. \u201cThis tastes like crap.\u201d He drops the cup, and I roll my eyes at his attempt at drama. Even when he falls to the floor, I still think he\u2019s messing around. But then the wheezing starts. Read more"

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great, Suspenseful YA Mystery",
                "reviewText": "I think I went off on the wrong foot with this book; I wrongly and mistakenly assumed that this book wasn\u2019t for me \u2013 boring, full of high school dramas and teenage angst which, to tell the truth, were not my thing at the moment.It indeed took a while for this book to grow on me. As I mentioned earlier, except for the first chapter where Simon, a notorious gossip mastermind of Bayview High, mysteriously died from a severe peanut allergy, I spent a huge chunk of the first half frustrated and feeling detached from the story. I knew the book was in the middle of build up, but what I thought endless, too detailed descriptions about the four suspects \u2013 the four students \u2013 and their backgrounds and emotional conflicts were a bit too much for me. I was expecting more of the mystery \u2013 whodunnit \u2013 elements (as this book is supposedly YA mystery), definitely NOT high school dramas involving drama kings and drama queens where they whine and go on and on about what they have done wrong. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t remotely interested in such kind of stuff. It may sound harsh, but I was pretty close to giving up on this book.But I didn\u2019t want to.So I tried to throw all my preconceived ideas about this book and start over with a clean slate, seeing this book as a mere YA contemporary rather than a YA mystery.And I\u2019m glad to say, it worked. It actually took me another 20% of the book to get me fully invested in this book, it worked nonetheless. I think it was where a big secret of the Mr. Nice guy was finally out and how it leads to a debacle of his future, friendship and familial relationship. The grim undertone reeled me in the story in the true sense of the word \u2013 for the first time \u2013 and I realized this book might call for readers in the right frame of mind and being patient. Your opinions might differ from mine and you may have been hooked by this book straight away, but it wasn\u2019t the case for me. It needed me to read this book with the same approach that I usually take when reading YA contemporary/romance.Anyways, from then onwards, I found this book pretty unputdownable; I enjoyed all the elements in this book. Friendship, budding romance, suspicion, and emotional struggles and guilt from what they have done. Such elements are really well-integrated and gelled with the main plot, and I definitely enjoyed the thrills and excitement as I was inching towards the end, as I got closer to the revelations to the whole plot.Although I might have made this book out to be devoid of the mystery elements earlier, it isn\u2019t true. The disturbing and mysterious \u2018Tumbler\u2019 posts which were not ought to be published because of Simon\u2019s death certainly got me curious to know who actually killed Simon. Was it either of the four students? Or is there an accomplice??The plot twist which I didn\u2019t see it coming took me by surprise but this book doesn\u2019t end there \u2013 there\u2019s actually another important key to this murder case and I thought it was really well done. I read the last 30% in one sitting \u2013 I was kept on the edge of my seat, I couldn\u2019t put it down.The characters, especially the main four characters are all well-fleshed out. Their issues, secrets and consternation from unexpectedly embroiled in the murder case are well delineated with the solid writing and alternating multiple POVs, getting me emotionally close to them. I especially enjoyed how the four characters begin to close ranks to get down to the bottom of the case, supporting each other despite the fact they were not really friends nor particularly close before it happened.When the story, or the situations surrounding the main character(s) spin out of control, multiple POV style works really well, giving readers enough glimpse of their emotional process and what is going on in their minds. It adds a lot of tension and intrigues, a sheer delight of reading. Karen M. McManus certainly pulled off in that regard.She\u2019s also brilliant at messing with our emotions \u2013 getting our hopes up and then crushing them on the next second. I went through this agony especially in Bronwyn\u2019s chapters. I personally Bronwyn and Cooper\u2019s chapters are outstanding compared to the ones of the other two characters. I might be wrong, but I felt that way anyway.I appreciate this book ends on a light, hopeful note. The four characters have gone through their own nightmares and debacles, it has also made them stronger and be honest to themselves.This book left me with warm feelings, wondering what their future holds for them.Apart from the depictions of police procedural being pretty shoddy (I was like, \u2018Come on, they couldn\u2019t be this sloppy, could they?\u2019), I am quite satisfied with this book.This is surprisingly emotionally charged, well-written book. I am glad I ended up liking this book in the end.Another lesson NOT to easily DNF a book; Story CAN pick up where you leave off.",

When I say I could not stop myself from reading this book every second I had to spare I am not kidding. I haven't had as much time as I normally do to read here lately but as soon as I saw a chance to get a few more pages into the story I took it every single time. I really enjoyed how we see the events following that horrible day in detention play out through different perspectives but not all of them. Keeping some of the characters' point of view for certain parts of the story a mystery added this air of uncertainty as you try to unravel what actually happened and who could have been behind it. The friendships formed due to the bond they share by going through this situation together give me the \"found family\" feelings that keep me coming back to a book over and over. Then the twist in the plot and the truth being revealed was such a satisfying moment that it took the whole story to the next level for me. I am so excited to dive into the next in the series!",
