                "reviewText": "I went into this one with high hopes with the gorgeous cover that screams juicy beach read and the Fire Island setting, which seems to be the hot place for summer novels this year, and a special favorite of mine as my husband grew up as a year rounder in the town next to Saltaire so I\u2019m familiar with the area, if not the summer people themselves. I ended up liking it, but not loving it.The story takes place over the course of a summer, when the city people flock to their Fire Island houses for a few months of idyllic relaxed beach life, biking around town (no cars allowed, one of my favorite island features!), drinking freely, and in the case of this story, behaving very badly. It starts with a dead body, and then veers off into the gossipy group for so long you sort of forget someone dies until you get to the end and the plot heads back in that direction.There are a lot of characters to keep track of, and the story alternates between a lot of different perspectives so it gets a bit confusing. And they are basically all doing some form of lying, cheating, and stealing throughout, not a redeeming quality in sight. It also overlaps the timeline to share the story of the same occurrence from different perspectives, which took me a bit to pick up on. But still, I wanted to see how it all played out, and I did like that all the questions were answered by the end.Pick this one up if you like beach reads with a large dose of scandalous behavior, skip if if you\u2019re not a big fan of cheating and lying themes.",

Not sure so many people were needed and it did prove a bit confusing at times. I think the author was trying for some exciting twists at the end, but they fell flat. More like one-upmanship than actual plot twists. The author\u2019s use of \u201cbutton-down\u201d to describe everyone\u2019s shirts drove me crazy. Not sure why the author was so in love with that word\u2014it proved distracting. Recommend as a beach read, because it was a quick read with little substance.",

Let me save you the time I just wasted.Wow, what a disappointment! Sure, Bad Summer People gives an overview of life in one of the preppiest towns on FI, Saltaire (here called Salcombe). Other than that...nada.This is one of those books where every character is despicable: arrogant, posturing guys; vapid, wealthy women; desperate social climbers (everyone).BSP opens with the discovery of a body and then jumps back in time several months.The first 3/4 or so of the ENTIRE BOOK is waiting to find out who died (the cleverest part of this book is the teasing of possible murder every time a character is walking home alone- unfortunately all cleverness stops there).There is literally zero further plot. People gossip, do bad things, drink a lot. There's a lot of brand name dropping (not in the fun way), and weirdly ageist/misogynistic stuff like describing 35-year-old women as \"well-preserved\" and milking a sad, desperate singleton character who's all of 42. (Admittedly the author is pretty savage on the guys as well.)There is no whodunit here, no suspense, and basically no fun. (Also no copy editing - the grammar is messy to the point of atrocious.) The ending is as meh as meh can be.This is not the entertaining beach read it's sold as; it's a quick and boring slog through the world's dullest mean beach town. You are better off with a fros\u00e9 and a tabloid than Bad Summer People.",
