Secondly and more importantly, this is almost a word for word duplication of Bickers' The Savage Sky in many of the pages. Only the names were changed and the way it starts out was different. The Savage Sky was written much better than this book.",

In the end, the story showed the cruelty and chance of war for those that had to fly for hours of boredom then seconds/minutes of terror and helplessness of chances for survival! My father flew PBY's in the South Pacific on 20+ hour missions with similar stories (41-45).",

                "reviewTitle": "An engaging aviation thriller with a focus on the characters & operational details of their mission",
                "reviewText": "Air Patrol is promoted on Amazon as an explosive, action packed, military aviation thriller adventure novel. However, I found it more than this; it is a character driven story about both the members of an aircrew shot down during a mission searching for U-Boats in the second world war and the men who set out to try and rescue them before the enemy find them. It not only focuses on the lives of the men and women involved but also provides a lot of detail about operational aspects of the mission. It reads as if you are actually onboard the plane, or in the Ops Room with the crew members and clearly shows that the author has first hand experience of wartime operations.It is difficult to know exactly when this novel was written. The dialogue reflects that of the period (c. 1943) and as such parts of it may be considered by some readers unacceptable today ... but for me it adds authenticity to the story and its setting.So if you are looking for an explosive, action packed, military aviation thriller adventure novel then please bear in mind that this story is as much about the characters and the operational aspects of the situations in which they find themselves.",
