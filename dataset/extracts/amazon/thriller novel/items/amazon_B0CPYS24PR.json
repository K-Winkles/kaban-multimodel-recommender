        "description": "In the small upstate town of Misty River, two seemingly unconnected crimes occur in the space of two years. First, the town's beloved Italian baker Frank is found lying in a pool of blood, with his head nearly severed from his body. The brutal, cold-blooded murder that shocked the residents of Misty River was never solved. Two years later, elementary school teacher Olivia is abducted and forced at gunpoint into the secluded woods along the Misty River, where she is brutally beaten and raped on Saint Patrick's Day night.With this debut novel, David Franceschelli introduces Blake Moretti, the relentless prosecutor and witty sidekick investigator. How and why these crimes are connected is up to relentless prosecutor Blake Moretti to determine. Blake devises a plan to trap the murderer. As he takes on the slippery murderer with all the answers, what was once a cold-case murder turns piping hot. From the first heart-stopping line to the last, \"Misty River\" is a page-turner that will keep you up late into the night. Read more",
