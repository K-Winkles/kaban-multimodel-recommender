It was an action adventure story with plenty of twists and turns with sufficient political and military intertwining. This Cap Daniels series is adventurous, daring, and full of espionage intrigue that keeps the reader engaged, excited, and enthralled. Each story in the series keeps me wanting more and Daniels keeps the excitement meter running with plenty of books in the series (15 to date) If there was such a thing as an \u201cexcitement meter,\u201d author Cap Daniels would probably own the patent to it because it\u2019s amazing how he incorporates so much thrill and excitement in all the novels that I have read so far. Another thrilling read by a talented and clever author.",

                "reviewText": "In \u201cUnending Chase\u201d, Chase is taking us along on another breath-holding adventure \u2026. literally. Danger follows at every turn as he, Clark and their team try to avert disaster in the Panama Canal. Both above and below the surface of murky waters bad things are afoot and heroic efforts are being made to thwart the diabolical plan. Meanwhile, just being in the vicinity of where his family was brutally murdered, shakes Chase to his core. Yet, he has a job to do \u2026 and it almost is his last.There are a few new faces added to this one that I feel we will see again in the future and some surprises, both good and bad along the way. We see a different side of Chase, maybe more than one that even surprise him. As always, Cap leaves us with a huge tease at the end wanting assurances that he is busy on the NEXT adventure.My husband is now an avid fan of Cap Daniels. too. I am an advance reader, but I make him wait for the launch \u2026 how diabolically mean is that??? You cannot go wrong with this exciting series, be you male or female. It appeals to both!If you are a sailing enthusiast or even if you are not, you might also want to pick up Cap's \"I Am Gypsy\". It is a bittersweet story as told from the perspective of a sailboat. All proceeds from the sale of this unrelated delightful book go to Hurricane Michael Relief efforts in Florida's Panhandle.",

In the past two weeks, I have read seven books in the CHASE FULTON NOVELS series by Cap Daniels. The series is so tightly knit together that even when I have other books waiting on my Kindle, I have to read the \u201cnext\u201d book in the series to keep up with the action. They are addictive. For those of you totally unfamiliar with the series, Chase is a young \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d who works as a contractor for shadowy governmental agencies. Mostly he has been operating in the Caribbean, but he\u2019s gone from the heat of the Panama Canal to an operation in wintery Russia that made me cold just reading about it. At present he is living on a 50\u2019 catamaran which he homeports in St. Augustine, Florida.I\u2019d like to tell you more, but I really don\u2019t want to be a spoiler. I will say this: if you are a fan of the Caribbean thriller genre, you will love these books. If you are not \u2026 then what the heck is wrong with you? Too snooty?Buy these books. Read them in order. Sign up for Cap\u2019s newsletter to get the painfully short freebie backstory book. Do it. NOW!David Thatcher Wilson, authorSmith Beach Press",
