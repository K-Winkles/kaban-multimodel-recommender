        "description": "Don't miss the New York Times and USA Today bestseller and addictive psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist that\u2019s burning up Instagram and TikTok--Freida McFadden\u2019s The Housemaid is perfect for fans of Ruth Ware, Lisa Jewell, and Verity. Every day I clean the Winchesters\u2019 beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor. I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew\u2019s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it\u2019s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina\u2019s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband. I only try on one of Nina\u2019s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it\u2019s like. But she soon finds out\u2026 and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it\u2019s far too late. But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don\u2019t know who I really am. They don\u2019t know what I\u2019m capable of\u2026 Read more",

Millie was recently let go from her job, and was forced to live in her car. Desperate to find a job with room and board included, she applies for a live in maid/nanny position. Millie doesn\u2019t expect to get the job, but a week after interviewing for the job she gets a call asking if she wants it.Millie sees instantly why the Winchesters needed help, their place is a mess. Nina Winchester is rude to Millie from day one. Nina will purposely tell Millie one thing, to turn around and say she never asked her to do it to begin with. Andrew Winchester is the complete opposite, he\u2019s kind, and understanding.Millie is forced to live in their attic, on a small cot, with a door that only locks from the outside, but it\u2019s better than living in her car. After working for the Winchester\u2019s for a while, she can\u2019t understand how Andrew is married to such an awful woman as Nina. Millie and Andrew start to get close, maybe too close. Millie thinks she understands what\u2019s happening at the Winchester\u2019s, but by the time she realizes she was wrong, it\u2019s already too late.",

                "reviewText": "The Housemaid by Frieda McFadden is basically a story about two women - Millie Galloway and Nina Winchester. Millie is a prison parolee who is down on her luck and living out of her car. Nina is the wife of a successful businessman living a life of leisure and luxury. She hires Millie to be the family maid.Millie soon learns that Nina is a bit eccentric if not outright crazy. Millie begins to despise her shortly after she begins the job. She also develops an attraction to Nina\u2019s \u201chunky\u201d husband Andy who also is attracted to Millie. During a weekend when Nina is away, Millie and Andy, of course, attend a Broadway show and spend the night together. Millie secretly wishes that Nina would leave so she can have Andy to herself and become \u201cqueen of the house.\u201d Eventually, following a heated vocal argument, Andy tells Nina to \u201cget out\u201d because he does not love her anymore. Millie appears to have gotten her wish - or does she? Every story has two sides. Once the other side becomes known the reader learns the jaw-dropping twist.I found The Housemaid a little befuddling. They story is well written and the author cleverly disguises the actual events. But, the first half of the book goes on and on over the same territory - Millie dislikes Nina and has fantasies of winning her husband. The the next 25% the story is Nina\u2019s version of the same situations. It gets to the point of OK, I get it already! Finally, the surprises begin to occur and things get more interesting. But, by then, you almost do not care anymore.There is not a lot of character development and the situations are all too reminiscent to so may of a cheap romance novel. I did not find The Housemaid to be \u201caddictive psychological thriller\u201d rather it is an entangled mess of psychotic characters. The 3 main characters all seem unstable and delusional with no redeeming traits, although Nina, surprisingly, comes closest to being likable.",

                "reviewText": "This was the first book I brought when I got my Kindle. I put it off for so long and finally started to read it TWO WEEKS AGO! This is my first book read from this author even though I brought four of her books. It was a simple enough writing style that it made for an \u201ceasy\u201d read. This story follows Millie, an ex-con who\u2019s living in her car and looking for work. Nina hires her to help clean and watch her bratty daughter. This book is suppose to be a psychological thriller, but it was more of a contemporary thriller. This is about an abused wife trying to escape and getting some revenge. The way it was tickled in I disliked. I was easily put off by Nina\u2019s mistreatment of Millie and that led to me putting the book down for over a week . I guess I finally found a \u201ctrigger\u201d. Wealthy people getting off on mistreating their workers burned me deep in my soul. No matter what the intent was , her turning cruel to someone else and setting them up for it is a terrible thing. I get the author\u2019s intent was to take you to that place and bring you back with shock, but I don\u2019t forget and I rarely forgive so I disliked Nina and never felt for her even after so finished the book. When they switched to Nina\u2019s pov, I put the book down again. I tried each day to read but didn\u2019t get past more than one page . Tonight I forced myself to finish this book. I will say when they switched back to Millie\u2019s pov it picked back up and I started enjoying it again. I didn\u2019t like how choppy the storylines were and the way they lingered the mistreatment of Millie for most of the book while giving us rushed events throughout wasn\u2019t planned well. I\u2019d still recommend this to someone who is looking for a domestic violence story where the ex gets her revenge. I like where the author is taking Millie\u2019s storyline though.",

Haven't been able to get into a book for months now, just couldn't find something that grasped my attention. Bought the second one first, didn't know there was a first, and couldn't put it down. Snatched the first one on Amazon a couple days later and same thing, couldn't put it down! Read both books in under 2 weeks because I was so into it, would have been sooner if I didn't have stuff to do, or work lol! Definitely recommend! Cannot wait for the third one! Preordered and I'm just sitting here looking out the window until it arrives in June!",
