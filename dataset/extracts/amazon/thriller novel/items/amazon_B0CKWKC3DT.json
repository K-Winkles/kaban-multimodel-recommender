                "reviewText": "Train travels are romantic. Sure, there are overcrowded trains people board through the open window, as there is no way to fight the crowds of passengers trying to enter using the doorway, and those can hardly be called \"romantic.\" But there are other trains, seen in luxury travel ads, with people sipping champagne and contemplating the beautiful landscape.Such a train is \"The Ghan,\" the Australian train that passes through the desert wilderness, traveling four days to Adelaide and offering unforgettable views. However, in \"Everyone On This Train Is A Suspect\" by Benjamin Stevenson, passengers experience something they wish to never encounter \u2013 a murder.Six writers are invited to participate in an unusual writers' conference on the train. Ernest Cunningham, who wrote just one book, \"Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone\" (the first installment of the Ernest Cunningham series), has also been invited, or at least he thinks so, not suspecting other reasons for him being there. When the most obnoxious writer is murdered, other writers try to solve the puzzle before the train arrives at its destination. They all have good reasons and skills how to commit murder. Ernest turns out to be a great amateur detective, and, as the mystery is written as a personal narrative, we follow his adventures sprinkled with humorous commentaries and unexpected turns.I'm a big fan of such mysteries. Ernest's character is young, a bit goofy, but very observant and intelligent. Like other amateur detectives, he has a knack for getting into trouble. I wish the rest of the characters were better developed. Still, perhaps there needed to be more time to go into the secondary characters' depth: as I mentioned, there are six writers, a literary agent, a fan, and Ernest's girlfriend. Lots of characters! The novel is primarily action-driven, but eventually, we get the taste of psychological twists when we gradually learn more about the characters. The author references \u2013 often in a humorous way \u2013 the rules of a good mystery, especially the cozy kind, and we see how it was influenced by other \"train mysteries,\" especially Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" I hope it will be made into a movie, with all the visual advantages of pictures. It's a great ride!",

Thanks to netgalley I was able to take this Agatha Christie-like whodunnit mystery on vacation with me! I powered through the first book in this series on audio, but I enjoyed this ebook format much more!What I liked:\u2022the narrator\u2019s sense of humor and sarcasm. I definitely laughed out loud a few times. Murder, mystery and comedy?\u2022the narrator hinted often at who the suspect(s?) might be. So gets you thinking.\u2022the opening 1/3 and closing 1/3 of the book were the best parts for me and kept my attention.\u2022the setting on The Ghan Train in Australia. Google it!What I didn\u2019t like:\u2022way too many characters for me to keep track of. I had to take notes and use the kindle lookup feature often.\u2022I never really could guess who did it, because I didn\u2019t really get to know all the characters well enough.\u2022Again with this book much like his last, it was a novel about the process of writing a book, but the book was the story we were reading. Again\u2026the broken 4th wall, and occasional \u201cthis isn\u2019t fiction, it\u2019s real life\u201d comments rub me the wrong way.If you\u2019re a fan of Agatha Christie or big cast mysteries, then read both this author\u2019s books!Book 4 of 2024Read January 17-27",

                "reviewText": "This is a fun book. I did not read the first book in the series, \"Everyone in my Family has Killed Someone:\" and I plan to. I have been an avid mystery reader from a very young age and think often about form and plot. So one engaging aspect of this book is Ernest Cunningham's checklist about what features in a fair mystery. Ernest has written one book (Everyone in my Family) but it was a true crime story. Here he is also present for one or more crimes when attending a writer's conference as a panelist/speaker. It is the fiftieth anniversary of the organization and so the conference is being held on a luxury old Australian train, the Ghan. Ernest's girlfriend, Juliette, also a writer, is with him. The other invited speakers range from a wildly famous Scottish mystery writer to, well, Ernest. He is supposed to be writing a novel but nothing at all has come to him. No plot, no paragraphs, no nothing. Just a checklist showing at what point in a mystery various things should have occurred.Thanks to enmity among some of the passengers with a history and the personality of some of the passengers there is unease, a bit of nastiness amongst those at the bar, and eventually a murder. Ernest recognizes fairly quickly that he has a potential book afoot and he starts doing his research, i.e., questioning people, looking about in places that may not be public and comparing notes with one of the other writers who is also hot on the trail. The book flows nicely. Nobody is particularly deep but the characters are amusing, the formula is followed, I probably missed a dozen hidden puzzles but the clues were also there. Yes. I missed some key ones and the red herrings worked on me this time. Definitely a recommend.",

He's right, a book is not a thing without both a writer and a reader, or hopefully loads of readers, you get my point. I really enjoy reading a book where the end result makes sense, and a reader should be given a fair chance to \"work it out\" for themselves. Another entertaining read, and I learnws a few things. Like, I've always taught the kids a \"Blurb\" let's you know what a book is about, I never knew that another author's review is also called a blurb.

I love a good murder mystery, and I did my Master's thesis on \"Golden Age\" crime fiction, so I enjoy seeing the genre gently sent up, even if a bit over-explained. As a writer, yes, a published one (not self-published) with 2 awards, I also adore seeing the publishing world and a lot of writers/agents/ writing fashions/etc sent up too. All good clean sometimes laugh-aloud fun. But yes, a bit too wordy in places and the hero/detective/narrator is not as engaging as I would have liked. But worth 4 stars on the whole.
