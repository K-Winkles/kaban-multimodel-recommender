These guys are a tough group. And in this old diesel boat, far tougher. Story was top notch and believable. I thought Joan driving the boat was a stretch, but fun nonetheless less. Targeting a charging DD with a deck load of depth charges has got to be the place for a cool hand. Very Good Thank you, hoping to see Bull Shark in my Pacific!",

                "reviewText": "This book was slow going for more than half of it but picked up pace later. Unfortunately that pace increase was due to the SS landing on American shores and kidnapping the wife of the only US military unit that was trying to stop the Germans on the US eastern seaboard. A sub commander. Fortunately the Germans just happened to have a Nazi spy that was close to the sub commander's wife. Couple this with 2 German soldiers that were more than happy to betray their company after only a few hours in American hands. Just an every day event it seems. This is beyond ludicrous and into comic book land. I deleted the book unfinished.",
