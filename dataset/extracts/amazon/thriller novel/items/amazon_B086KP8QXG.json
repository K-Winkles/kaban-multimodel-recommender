        "description": "Her body is frozen, unable to move. Her eyes are locked on the blood leaving her body in a steady string of droplets, collecting in the bone ash porcelain bowl engraved with intricate gold leaves. Her parted lips let out a shriek that no one hears. He just smiles and wipes her tears with cold fingers. \u201cWow. I think I just fell head over heels in love with a fictional character. Tess Winnett is one of the smartest FBI agents and profilers I have come across yet and with analytical skills to rival Sherlock Holmes. Hats off to Leslie Wolfe for easily the best thriller I have read in this genre for many, many years!\u201d \u2013 Manie Kilianon, five stars review on Amazon.The girl: missingAfter fifteen-year-old Kaylee disappears without a trace, FBI Special Agent Tess Winnett is assigned to the case that falls outside of the normal purview of the FBI. With every lead she uncovers, more questions are posed with only one possible, terrifying answer: there are others like her who have vanished, never to be seen or heard from again.Is there a pattern in these disappearances? What happened to the others who have vanished? Is there a connection, or is Tess chasing shadows?The first twenty-four hours: criticalFrantic for answers and painfully aware of each passing moment, Tess has a choice to make, one that could save the life of a young girl: was Kaylee\u2019s disappearance a singular event, or was she the latest victim of a serial killer no one knew existed?The odds of finding the girl alive drop with every second passing by and making the wrong choice would seal her fate. Her blood would be on her hands.The best-selling author of Dawn Girl is back with another suspenseful, gripping crime thriller. If you\u2019re a fan of David Baldacci, Melinda Leigh, and James Patterson, you will enjoy Leslie Wolfe\u2019s enthralling police procedural that will keep you reading until the last page.What Readers and Reviewers Are Saying About Leslie Wolfe\u201cWolfe's strong female characters, who all appear to be flawed, never disappoint. \u201d\u201cThe action is immediate and nonstop, and just when you think you have it all figured out, Wolfe tosses in a twist so masterful that it\u2019ll make your head spin. \u201d\u201cWow... Leslie Wolfe is an incredible story teller. Can't wait for more of Agent Tess Winnett.\u201d\u201cLeslie Wolfe has a wonderful ability to make you feel as if you were right there watching the events unfold in this fast paced and nail-biting thriller.\u201d",

                "reviewText": "I did really enjoy this, though I rarely give novellas 5* as I just don't like them much. However, this author made instalments 5, 6 and 7 all shorts in this series so if I wanted to keep reading I had to cave in. I love the series but I'm pleased to see book 8 is back to a PROPER length novel at long last !!It was an intriguing tale as Tess tried to locate a girl who'd disappeared that has a connection to her boss, making it a doubly stressful job this time out !! I recently read a book featuring a 14 year-old teenage girl and was shocked at how much of a gullible nitwit she was......and in this story this one is the same but a year older !! I just don't recall ever being THAT naive or trusting when I was their age, nor any of my pals.And, I know it is a short book but I didn't spot a single mistake, and that's a proper \"whoop, whoop\" moment for this reader, as it so rarely happens !! Someone called Joni Wilson is mentioned as the editor at the end of the book and the first novella was also tremendously presented, so if she is the reason I hope she sticks around. I have instalment 7 downloaded so have to sit through another \"half a book\" but at least I know number 8 is one to really look forward to.",
