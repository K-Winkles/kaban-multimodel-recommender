After reading as many Alex Delaware novels as I have, I've come to think of Milo and his merry band of junior detectives as friends. Comfortable with their idiosyncrasies as well as their strengths, it makes me curl up on the couch and settle in for a treat when I begin each new book. Robin, Rick, Spike, followed by Blanche, even the Koi, make me feel at ease. I love their back stories and how that contributes to the pace of the stories. The murders are always off kilter, strange, and mysterious puzzles to be pieced together by the dynamic duo of Alex and Milo. I have yet to read one yet that I haven't liked, and I've been reading Kellerman's books since the mid-1980s. I hope to read many more.",

                "reviewText": "You can have money and be thought wealthy, but money isn't everything. Detective Milo Sturgis calls in his pal, Dr. Alex Delaware to help investigate the murder of a young photographer. The photographer was a son of a very wealthy man who cared little for the various ex-wives and children he left behind. He provided for them financially but that was all. The photographer's last project involved a number of homeless people. A kind hearted man, one whom Delaware suspects felt guilty for his fortunate circumstances, treated all the participants well and paid them generously. But could one of the \"Wishing\" participants have become greedy and returned to collect more?Interesting family dynamics or lack thereof are explored. The close friendship of Milo and Alex, two very different people is always a positive aspect of the series. Alex's insights into the criminals motives, as well as those about the victims are well written and sensible making him a believable psychologist. Kellerman's novels are consistently enjoyable.",
