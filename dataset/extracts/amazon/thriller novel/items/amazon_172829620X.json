I give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up for the purpose of this review. It wasn't as edge of my seat as her others, it wasn't as attention seeking as her previous books and the reader was actually able to kind of guess some of the twists in this one.The turtle's were a bit much - it became a bit overwhelming, I mean I like turtles, but the amount of turtle stuff was too much - it was filler/fluff designed to make the book longer and this reader didn't appreciate it. The character's weren't exactly likeable and the reader didn't want to root for any of them - they were just annoying at some parts.The plot was good, it was unique, and it had some really good parts, but also some really eh parts. I will read more by this author because I usually love her books, but for some reason this one just wasn't a favorite. Overall a good read, but not the best. Give it a read and see for yourself!",

                "reviewText": "Natalie is the most successful salesperson at her health and beauty products company. She is beautiful and charismatic. She hosts a yearly 5K run for cerebral palsy, in honor of her childhood friend Amelia who died of it.The story starts with her strange cubical mate Dawn who obsessively loves turtles, missing from her desk. As she is also obsessively punctual, Natalie is shocked to not see her there. Dawn\u2019s phone rings and Natalie answers it to hear a weak cry for help, then the line goes dead. Could that be Dawn? She encounters her new office boy friend, Caleb, on her way to ask her boss, Seth, if Dawn called in sick. Caleb hasn\u2019t seen Dawn, and Seth hasn\u2019t heard from her either.Natalie finds a ceramic turtle on her desk that wasn\u2019t there before, encrusted in a dried russet substance. Is someone messing with her? What does it mean?As the story unfolds, we start to see Natalie in a different light than she presents herself. She see\u2019s herself and her motives in a more generous way than reality. We also see Dawn through her emails to her friend Mia, which paints a much different picture of Natalie, though Dawn is naive in her perceptions of Natalie-assuming a friendship and kindness that we are starting to see aren\u2019t real.The police are starting to see Dawn as a potential murder victim, and things are pointing to Natalie as the murderer as the detective starts to investigate these emails and other pieces of evidence occurring.All of the characters involved coalesce into the finale with plenty of twists and strange surprising motives. It\u2019s worth reading, but I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because the motives of the characters keep changing, even at the very end. You start to root for a character, then there\u2019s an abrupt change that is interesting but at the same time implausible. It ends with a prescient self awareness that was bleak, even when some characters get a \u201chappy ending.\u201d",

I liked how it goes back and forth in time so you can see the past, but it\u2019s only in e-mail form. Then it catches up and in typical mystery style the explanation happens and you get the twist. The twists keep coming though, which makes this book fun to read till the end. It does get a tiny bit into unbelievable territory, but it still works. Good read.",
