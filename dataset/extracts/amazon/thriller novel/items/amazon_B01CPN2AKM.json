I already had an idea of what would happen and when it didn\u2019t- I was disappointed. I wish I didn\u2019t have pre-conceived ideas of it because all together it really was a good book!I think the storyline keeps you on yours toes the whole time with a few shocking \u201cwhaaaat\u201d moments in there too! Overall, I think this book was very well written- very well thought out, and executed! I would 100% recommend this book!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m pretty new to this author\u2019s books which is a shocker I know. I\u2019ve been binge watching the Netflix show\u2019s of his stories, this one included and loved them that much, I had to buy some of his books as well.Even though I had watched the show and knew how it all plays out, it does differ slightly in that the detective\u2019s role in the book is much more smaller. Other than that, it was surprisingly very similar. A lot of films/shows cut lots out or change a lot of things but I think they did a great job on this one.Enough about the show now though and lets get to the story and characters. I loved Maya. I love a strong female role and we actually get a couple in this story with Maya and her mother in law, Judith. Both are strong willed who don\u2019t hold a lot love of for each other. In some respects, they are both quite similar in wanting wants best for their families.It\u2019s great to have a strong female/male friendship which Maya and Shane have fought together in the war as well as still being close as civilians. I like how Shane is always keeping an eye out for Maya and he is almost like a big brother. Lets face it, with losing a sister and husband to killers, it\u2019s good to have someone watching out for you.There are so many twists throughout, with lots of secrets and lies. You don\u2019t know who to trust and my heart was racing as Maya gets closer to uncovering the truth. The ending had me go through an array of emotions and even though having watched the show and knowing what was coming, I still felt like I was reliving it for the first time.Fool Me Once is brilliantly written, packed full of tension and fast paced. Just how I like this genre. It has a good cast of characters and is driven at speed by the plot. You will be routing for Maya throughout, although a lot of her actions had me holding my breath and in total awe of her courage and bravery. I loved my first taste of this author\u2019s books and am desperate for more. A thrilling and shocking read!",
