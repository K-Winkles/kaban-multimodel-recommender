How the characters\u2019 storylines fit together, the mystery of what really happened, and what is in store for their futures made it one of the best books I\u2019ve read in a while.

Start out with socialite family the Lambs, CEO father, PR agent mother ignore tween children sound s like a lot of other stories. But what happens when a quirky, bohemian, musician comes calling up roots everything and everyone. Good read, bit slow at some points, but I do recommend.",
