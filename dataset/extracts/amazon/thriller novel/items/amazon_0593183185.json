                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Brimming with neon-tinted, 90s nostalgia and a good old-fashioned unreliable narrator",
                "reviewText": "3.5 stars rounded up \u2606\u201cCharlie\u2019s tempted to tell him everything. The darkness, the close quarters, the warmth\u2014all of it sustains her confessional mood.\u201dThe lights go down to reveal a night plunged in darkness and nervous, charged expectancy for what is to come. Perhaps a cinematic night is about to unfold with the potent color, music, and nostalgia of the 90s, which Riley Sager captures moodily and richly in all its overwhelmingly neon-tinted, climactic glory. Once the scene is set, Charlie, our protagonist and certified movie aficionado, is looking for a ride back to Ohio where she can escape the suffocation of the past and her guilt that haunts her like a persistent ghost always waiting in the wings to attack. Her best friend, Maddy, has recently been killed by the Campus Killer, and she shoulders a majority of the blame for throwing out words she doesn\u2019t mean in a heated moment of no-return and leaving her in a time of need.So, not being able to wait a second more, she ventures to the ride-share board in hopes of finding someone to take her home to where Nana Norma waits and they can get lost in a movie-induced haze to forget their troubles. Enter in Josh Baxter, with his mega-watt, killer (could this be literal or figurative?!) smile and Olyphant Sweatshirt, which must promise safety if he\u2019s associated with Charlie\u2019s university, right? As luck would have it, he\u2019s headed in the same direction and is willing to drive her to her destination, but, you guessed it, their trip predictably gets madly side-tracked along the way as we\u2019re led to question if Josh is truly who he says he is or in fact the infamous killer on the loose? Will either he or Charlie see the light of day? The darkness holds you captive as spectator, as it houses secrets and encourages confessional outpourings.\u201cThat\u2019s the best way to describe daily existence, with its endless parade of drudgeries and disappointments. In real life, people don\u2019t break into song. They don\u2019t battle space monsters. And they certainly don\u2019t unwittingly get into the car with serial killers.\u201dAnd throw in the fact that Charlie becomes an unreliable narrator who can\u2019t tell the fiction of the movie scenes she creates in her mind, blacking out \u00e0 la Norman Bates, and reality apart. This part for me got muddled because it felt maddening rather than an added interesting layer to the story because of how wildly it swung in many different directions that felt too self-referential and frustrating to decode as reality completely folded in on itself. I lost truth where I needed it, which perhaps was part of the point, but, at moments, it went a smidge too far. There were also unbelievable tonal shifts in certain scenes that made it hard to understand why certain characters acted in certain ways or made certain decisions in specific moments, specifically Josh and Charlie. However, I didn\u2019t find Charlie nearly as gullible and insufferable as Lora, the narrator of Cover Story, the last novel I read, even if she naively still stumbles into a stranger\u2019s car when the Campus Killer is in their midst. She does question and second guess for longer periods of time, unlike Lora, who just accepted and trusted pretty mindlessly.\u201cAnd if Charlie\u2019s learned anything from the movies, it\u2019s that few things are more dangerous than someone with nothing to lose.\u201dAll in all, it was still a thrilling ride of cat-and-mouse, menacing predator and challenged prey, gaslighter and gaslightee, even if the latter half of the story lost some of the momentum that the exciting beginning had promised. I just wonder who you\u2019ll wind up trusting. When trust can be few and far between in these loaded moments and ongoing swells of emotions that have the ammunition of Josh\u2019s car speeding recklessly through the night, threatening, in reverse fashion of the usual expression, that the devil you do know, contrarily, may be worse than the devil you don\u2019t.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Review of survive the night, spoiler alert!",
                "reviewText": "This was my first book by this author, which I came across looking for a slasher/psycho horror story. The promised plot sounded intriguing: a young woman takes a ride on a 6hour trip with a stranger who might possibly be a serial killer. In the early 90s, when cellphones weren't popular with the masses and smartphones that could receive and send texts, photos, and share location didn't exist. Stop reading here if you don't want spoilers.I have to say, the book did deliver on that promise, at least until the diner plot twist. I could excuse Charlie willingly going with Josh to the car despite the presence of a police officer in the diner, because she was afraid for Marge and wasn't exactly the best decision maker in the story. Taking dumb decisions was already in character for Charlie. What I can't excuse is the plot twist the author added once Charlie went back to the diner.When Marge tied up Charlie, I was excited. I thought, either Charlie is the unluckiest woman in the world to come across two different psychopaths, or Marge is the aunt Josh briefly mentioned in the car ride. The latter would have been a great twist. Instead, it turns out Josh was just a bounty hunter hired by the grandmother of Charlie's dead best friend. Couldn't Marge just have gone to the Olyphant dorms herself and question Charlie? That would have been simpler, less psychotic, and less risky than hiring some guy who WORKS FOR THE POLICE AS A FREELANCER!The reveal of the actual killer didn't make any sense either, it felt too convenient to tie the story in a neat little bow. The story would have flowed better if Josh had remained as the killer-he certainly acted like one the entire ride.To add insult to injury, Charlie marries the guy who kidnapped her in the first place. Talk about sending a bad message. I was going to buy a copy for my sister as a warning of being careful with strangers, but I changed my mind.3 out of 5. Solid start, but the story took a wrong turn halfway through that made me shake my head in disappoinment.",

                "reviewText": "This was my third book by Sager so by now I knew what to expect. Great story, great scenery, good characters, twists galore and so so endings. I want to say that I did enjoy this book for the most part. I was about 90 percent of the way through before I got disappointed.The story is that a movie obsessed college student, named Charlie, is leaving her college due to a string of murders that have occurred. She takes a ride home from a stranger. Over the course of the ride she becomes more and more suspicious of the drivers true nature.As I said in the beginning, Sager knows how to set a scene. So many times while reading it felt like I was actually there. Like every Sager novel, there are twists. A few that I could spot from the beginning and a few that surprised me. Overall it\u2019s a solid 4/5. Maybe not as strong as \u201cthe last one left\u201d, but still good. The reveal of the killer seemed a little too convenient but overall I enjoyed the book.",

Sager definitely knows how to pack a punch when it comes to creating unease, tension and suspense. I hated the main character but to a certain extent Charlie wasn\u2019t written to be loved\u2026 and this book isn\u2019t your average thriller! I will be thinking about this story long after I finished the last page and that in itself is why I think it was a great read.",

However, the more I read this title, the more I noticed the similarities between the main characters - always a woman, always naive, always a victim in every way.It made me see the author in a different light and now I\u2019m not sure I can\u2019t bear the book (or him. And yes, it\u2019s a he and not a she, the author). I stopped half-way and I\u2019m trying to get back to it just to finish it and properly complain haha. Pardon me.There are also a lot of moments when the female character digresses and just trips hardcore in her unusual \u201cmovie blackouts\u201d condition. That gets very boring after the first time.My opinion is: if you\u2019ve read two books from Riley, that\u2019s enough. (Read the haunted house one, it\u2019s by far the best and the one with best reviews anyway.)",
