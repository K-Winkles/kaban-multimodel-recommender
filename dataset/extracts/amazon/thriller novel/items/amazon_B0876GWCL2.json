                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Texas tragedy, with levity",
                "reviewText": "I have lived in Austin, Texas for decades but I plead innocent to previous knowledge of Texas author, Julia Haeberlin. Now that I have read this latest novel of hers, I\u2019ve ordered three more of her books! That is how impressed I am her latest psychological suspense thriller. If you\u2019re hankering for a mystery studded in rural Texas grit with an urban savvy and snaky plot, you\u2019ve come to the right book.There\u2019s desert and desert mythology, the wide and starry sky, Texas wildflowers, small town suspicions, and the unsolved ten year disappearance of a nineteen-year-old girl, Trumanell Branson, and her father. Her brother, Wyatt, is a Boo Radleyesque character who has always been the primary (but unproven) suspect. There\u2019s a lot more in here to compel the reader; I was hooked from page one.Haeberlin captured my interest with her palpable humanity and atmospheric writing. This may be a police procedural, but it is also a character-driven portrait of a community still in pain. Odette, a police officer, is the protagonist with a personal stake in finding Trumanell, as she was her friend, and Wyatt was her first and longterm boyfriend and lover. They grew up together. Odette\u2019s father was the town\u2019s top cop at the time, but he\u2019s dead now for five years.At the moment of Trumanell\u2019s disappearance, Odette was trapped under her car after an accident, losing a leg in the process. Much is focused on the symbolism of her prosthesis and her missing leg becomes a kind of motif of loss, pain, and strength. Odette is married now to a successful Chicago attorney, but made a mistake by returning to Texas with him and falling backward into Wyatt again in a weak moment. Can you love two men? Finn, her husband, and a dead ringer for \u201cEmily Blunt\u2019s husband,\u201d isn\u2019t going to tolerate that.There are several mysteries in this small town. Wyatt finds a young, mute girl with a missing eye outside on the baked ground in the hot sun, barefoot. He names her Angel. A runaway? Abandoned? Odette has a covert group with her cousin, Maggie, daughter of the town preacher. They help these unmoored children by arranging escape from whatever danger they are in. And she relates to Angel\u2019s loss\u2014Odette\u2019s leg, Angel\u2019s eye. It is reminiscent of some of John Irving\u2019s themes (Haeberlin even includes a nod to Irving within the story)--abandoned children, missing body parts, and a touch of a dreamlike quality at times within the narrative.Told in first person from various characters\u2019 perspectives, the story advances with a thrum and well-paced rhythm, misted with levity and pop culture references. I was turning the pages with anticipation and suspense, but at intervals I enjoyed slowing down to enjoy interior moments, the characters\u2019 imaginations and poetic observations. These emotionally tortured characters are relatable and sympathetic, often with a warm and mordant wit. Carefully mapped and executed, it would take a really sullen and cynical reader to not embrace this southern, tragic, and hopeful story. It may leave dust in your mouth but it\u2019s also a breath of fresh air.",

                "reviewText": "This story felt like it could have been a true one. I was intrigued by the title and read it without having read the description, so I didn't know what to expect, or if it was even the kind of book I'd want to finish. I looked forward to reading it daily, it kept me hooked until the end. I normally don't like Whodunnit stories. I am more interested in character development and relationships than solving a mystery. This story had me wanting the mystery solved because it mattered so much to the characters. The research was thorough enough to give me a new understanding of some different walks of life than my own.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed this book. I had to make myself stop reading it so that I wouldn\u2019t finish it in one sitting. It\u2019s suspenseful, interesting, and very well-written. There are twists and turns at every corner and a shocking cliff hanger in the middle of the story that only feeds curiosity. I never got suspicious of any character for a second! 10/10 highly recommend (Planning to read Black-Eyed Susans next!)",

                "reviewText": "att has always been the prime suspect in Trumanell, his sisters, death. All that was left behind was her bloody handprint and she was never to be seen or heard from again. One afternoon Wyatt finds a girl near death in a field of dandelions.Odette is the towns youngest police officer and has always had a special spot for Wyatt. She does, however, believe he is the catalyst to solving the case of Tru. Odette is determined to solve not only Tru\u2019s case, but the current case. Will she be able to do so? Or is she placing herself in harm\u2019s way?I saw this book a while ago and added it to my list because it sounded right up my alley. I was lucky and able to get a copy from the library right away. As soon as I started reading, I was worried. The book was rather slow, but I checked some reviews and they mentioned that it picked up after a while, so I kept reading. For me the book never picked up and overall, I found it rather confusing. I went back and read the ending a few times just to see if I missed something, but I remain confused with how things turned out. I would have enjoyed reading this one with a friend so we could chat and work things out. I did enjoy the story through different points of view, they are usually fun and this one was no different.",

Rather than being a frenetic page turner, it is one of those books you want to sip rather than gulp; you want to enjoy curled up with your cat while relaxing with a cup of tea at your side.We have three POVs, all of which are equally wonderful, and a midpoint that genuinely shocked me. The story is at once a slow-burn mystery and a mystery wound so incredibly taut you won\u2019t be able to put the book down.Absorbingly atmospheric with a brooding presence, I highly recommend.",

The story didn't let us get to know her, or understand her and her brother's intense relationship.
