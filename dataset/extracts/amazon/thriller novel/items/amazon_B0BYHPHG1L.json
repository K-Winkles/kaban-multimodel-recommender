                "reviewText": "Has anyone seen my socks? When finishing John Grisham\u2019s recent novel \u201cThe Exchange\u201d, the story absolutely blew my socks off. For this reader, this is simply the best novel he has written.Mitch and Abby McDeere are back. This time they are back in a big way. Mitch is now a partner of the largest law firm in the world. They have offices throughout the world with the headquarters in Manhattan.They represent Lannak, a Turkish construction company, that has done a number of projects in Libya. The latest project is a massive bridge that was supposed to have a river of water underneath it, but instead it is a river of sand. The massive project was thought up by Colonel Gaddafi himself. The challenge for Mitch is that the Colonel has lost interest in the project and thus has not paid the Turkish company.Jack Ruch, the top man at Scully & Pershing, wants Mitch to go to Libya and appraise the situation. Jack takes with him a beautiful Italian woman who works at their UK office. Giovanna\u2019s father is the head partner in Italy. His daughter wanted to get out of the office and work with Scully & Pershing\u2019s international clients. Her first assignment is with Mitch in Libya.The plan is to first go to the bridge project and get a better understanding of the situation from the onsite managers of Lannak. Sometimes plans simply do not work the way they were meant to, especially in third world countries. What really appealed to this reader was the international aspect of dealing in the third world. This reader\u2019s career was outside the United States, and he still has memories of third world countries, especially Pakistan, that he would like to forget.\u201cThe Exchange\u201d is the sequel to the author Grisham\u2019s second novel \u201cThe Firm\u201d which was published in 1991. This reader read \u201cThe Firm\u201d over three nights in Tokyo in September, 1993. A re-read of that novel is now imperative.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, revisiting Mitch and Abbie from The Firm is an excellent idea. Throughout the years, all of Grisham's novels have well-formed, interesting characters. Bringing them back with what follows in their lives is an excellent idea. It's like catching up with old friends. As usual, Grisham can write. His characters, locations and plot always have just enough information to form complete pictures in the reader's mind, without going to boring extremes. He writes about things he knows, and it shows. So why only four stars? Occasionally, the story seems more like reading a journal than following a story. And keeping it real, I didn't really love Mitch and Abbie. It's like intellectually they learned from their mistakes, but when things got tough, expediency rules. Mitch and Abbie were really quite predictable. I found myself wanting to know more about the terrorist liaisons and Abbie's guard. What motivated them? What's their side of the plot and the story? All that being said, I do hope Grisham goes back to some of his other characters. They're often just too interesting to keep on a shelf.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Not the sequel that it's supposed to be",
                "reviewText": "Of the 41 adult novels that John Grisham has written, \u201cThe Firm\u201d was second, the debut novel having been \u201cA Time to Kill.\u201d Both have been made into movies. His most recent offering, \u201cThe Exchange\u201d (2023, 368 pages in hardback), has been promoted as a sequel to \u201cThe Firm.\u201d I don\u2019t know. To me, a sequel is something that picks up where the preceding novel left off. But, except for a \u201cpassing mention\u201d in the final pages, the only carryovers from \u201cThe Firm\u201d are Mitch and Abby McDeere. In the first novel, Mitch was fresh out of law school and got a job with the Memphis law firm Bendini, Lambert, and Locke that \u2014 unbeknownst to him \u2014 was tied in with the mob. In the new book, the storyline takes place 15 years later, Mitch is now a partner in the world\u2019s largest international law firm, Scullly & Pershing, and the plot has virtually no connection to the first book. But here\u2019s full disclosure. I\u2019ve never been satisfied with any of Grisham\u2019s sequels, so perhaps I was predisposed toward skepticism when I began to read this thriller. The book is kind of low on action, except for Mitch\u2019s many airplane flights: U.S., Europe, and North Africa. Abby also manages to get some trans-Atlantic frequent-flyer miles. The international aspects of the book emerge because Mitch is burned out on taking death-row cases, which he loses, as part of Scully & Pershing\u2019s commitment to pro-bono work. So, he agrees to help Luca Sandroni, a friend and a Scully & Pershing partner in Rome. Luca is handling a lawsuit on behalf of Turkish construction company Lannak. Lannak\u2019s owners are suing the government of Libya (which means they\u2019re suing Muammar Gaddafi) for an unpaid debt of $400 million. Gaddafi wanted a bridge to cross a river that he intended to create in the desert. However, Libyan engineers were unable to produce a river through thousands of miles of sand, so Gaddafi welched on the deal. However, Luca is dying. So, Mitch agrees to represent him in Libya. Luca\u2019s daughter, Giovanna, is a lawyer in London, is unhappy there, and pleads with Luca to join Mitch in Libya. Luca says that he\u2019s been there many times, and its perfectly safe. In Libya, Mitch decides that he must go and see this \u201cBridge to Nowhere,\u201d but he comes down with a nearly fatal case of food poisoning. Giovanna goes in his stead and is kidnapped by a ruthless and bloodthirsty gang. While Luca, Mitch, and the law partners await instructions for the ransom, Abby is contacted in New York by a mysterious woman. The woman is the go-between and will only deal with Abby. The gang wants $100 million, an impossible sum. The fast-paced \u201caction\u201d in the book mainly concerns the efforts to put together such a huge amount of money by involving several sources, including the governments of England and Italy, as Giovanna has duel citizenship. This book is enjoyable reading; I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s one of Grisham\u2019s best.",

                "reviewText": "In the conclusion to an Author\u2019s Note at the end of this book, The Exchange, John Grisham says, \u201cA special thanks to the readers who have enjoyed The Firm over the years and have been kind enough to write and ask: Will we ever see Mitch and Abby (McDeere) again?\u201d Well, The Exchange is Grisham\u2019s 41st novel, and 38 others have been written by this prolific author since The Firm, the book that introduced the McDeere\u2019s to this author\u2019s readership.In terms of time, it has been fifteen years since Mitch McDeere stole $15 million from the mob and disappeared. In its passing narrative, occupying some 334 pages from the Hodder and Stoughton publishers, The Exchange fills-in some of the details of that event, by way of offering a possible reason why, since then, Mitch and his wife, Abby, have lived in relative obscurity, with Mitch working his way to being one of the top lawyers working for the biggest law firm in the world, Scully & Pershing.It is not by chance that John Grisham is amongst the foremost writers of his time, and, in The Exchange, John Grisham tells the story of how a new case takes Mitch McDeere to Libya and his involvement in one of the biggest hostage negotiations in recent history. Terrorists who have murdered, and will do so again, have captured a fellow London-based lawyer with the firm of Scully & Pershing, Giovanna, the daughter of a wealthy Italian, Luca. Mitch and Giovanna had been representing Luca in his legal battle with the Libyan government over the latter\u2019s refusal to reimburse Luca for his company's work in building a bridge for the Libyan government in the Libyan desert.Whilst in Libya, Giovanna had been captured by terrorists and held for a $100 million ransom \u2013 to be paid within ten days. Mitch, and in due course, his wife Abby, has become central to the negotiations with the terrorists for Giovanna\u2019s release. The narrative of the novel develops from this situation. In some ways, The Exchange is a follow-up to The Firm, but in other ways it is a separate story which, with Grisham\u2019s narrative skills, simply and clearly offers some parallels between Mitch McDeere\u2019s previous experiences and those he now faces and shares with Abby. The difference now is that with the clock ticking, Mitch must remain one step ahead of those who have kidnapped Giovanna. So too, unlike his experiences with the mob who are intent on revenge, there is nowhere where Mitch can now hide.Early in the novel, John Grisham prepares his readers well for what is to come. There is a gradual development of the story, with important background information concerning his major characters. There are no overwhelming emotional or physical junctures, but it is a narrative that gradually draws in the reader as the story continues and develops. When it is reached, the denouement of the plot and the conclusion to the novel provides satisfaction and literary completion, rather than great tension and surprise. This is the mark of an experienced and successful writer, and, in these areas, there are few who are the equal of John Grisham.The Exchange is, for this reviewer, one of the most enjoyable and stimulating of John Grisham\u2019s later novels. Not only does The Exchange reintroduce the character of Mitch McDeere, but there is also a gentle but firm reminder that the author, John Grisham, remains one of the modern legends of literary fiction. The Exchange is well worth its purchase price and comes with this reviewer\u2019s highest recommendation.",
