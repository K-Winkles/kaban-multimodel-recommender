Even the ending makes the reader wonder what might happen next. The protagonist starts off as a good girl with a lot of odds against her. She does not play the victim easily, yet life seems to double-cross her so many times that her personality develops into that of a sociopath. Her worst enemy is a psychopath, so she has to fight fire with fire. It takes one, to know one.",

Even though I know the purpose of only giving us Evie\u2019s point of view is deliberate in order for twists to occur, the twists were really flat.All in all I would read this author again.",

It was an exciting read.I like the short chapters and the testing between the women. I didn\u2019t have a clue how it would end and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Needless to say Alice and Evie are most definitely not friends.I would absolutely read another book by Rebecca De Winter.Good first book.",

                "reviewText": "Evie and Alice were childhood neighbours and best friends but it\u2019s been 20 years since Evie suddenly left their school and the last time they spoke. Now, Evie is moving back to the UK and despite their previously toxic relationship she just can\u2019t stop herself from contacting Alice, who seems to have everything Evie covets.I found the first half of the book quite emotional as Evie deals with her fertility issues and a failing marriage, but once she reunites with Alice the story really ramps up into a dark and twisty thriller. Told entirely from Evie\u2019s point of view we only have her word to rely on but it\u2019s clear both women have a past they\u2019d rather keep hidden and will stop at nothing to keep it that way.The plot is fast-paced, extremely readable and full of surprises. It\u2019s a tale of love, friendship, and revenge served ice cold! There\u2019s some difficult themes in the story but De Winter has managed to pull it off in style, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what she writes next.",

                "reviewText": "Rebecca De Winter has delivered a turbulent, twisting tale for her debut novel. The book is written at a steady pace and the reader is quickly drawn into Evie\u2019s world and her mixed feelings about childhood best friend, Alice.After decades of no contact, Evie and Alice reconnect, but everything isn\u2019t as rosey as is should be\u2026The story gripped me instantly and Evie was easy to connect with. De Winter\u2019s writing has feminist touches woven into it and is narrated from Evie\u2019s point of view.I read this in two sittings and found it hard to put down. I didn\u2019t see the twist coming (and it\u2019s a good one!) .I can\u2019t wait to see what other stories this writer delivers. I really enjoyed Best Friends and highly recommend it to people who like fast-moving thrillers.",
