There\u2019s not a lot to dig into with the characters, but all in all, it\u2019s enjoyable enough to continue reading in order to find out what\u2019s going on. The twist is a bit frustrating when revealed fairly late on in the story due to a narrator hold back. Either way, a decent read.",

                "reviewText": "Megan Miranda is a brilliant person and a beautiful writer. All of her novels shine with incredible imagery and complex plots. I believe her writing is not to be read quickly, by skimming the content to get to the drama. Miranda writes with an intensity that makes the reader slow down and visualize the environment and the emotion of the world she writes about. Her work does not drag, however, as the pace of the book steadily develops and draws the reader into the story. Her characters are well developed and complex, with each character becoming more involved with the others as the plot unfolds. Miranda's knowledge of the people and the atmosphere of western North Carolina makes for a remarkable background for her novels. The Last To Vanish is a perfect example of Miranda's skillful writing, plot development, and character creation. I have read each of her novels for adults, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading this latest publication. All of her novels are excellent, as each paragraph is well thought out and intense. Spend time with her books, and enjoy the work she puts forth.",

                "reviewText": "I recently read The Last to Vanish by Megan Miranda. This is the story of a woman, Abby, who works at an inn in western North Carolina. The big draw of this picturesque vacation spot is the hiking, rafting, general outdoorsiness. In the past, there have been problems when people have gone missing on the hiking trails. When a mysterious guest checks in, Abby's curiosity is peaked. She discovers that the guest, Trey, is the brother of one of those who had disappeared. As Trey begins his exploration of his brother's actions Abby is surprised by what she discovers while trying to assist him. All is not right at the inn and the evidence is mounting that something is very wrong.While I don't really consider Megan Miranda's books heart pounding thrillers, this is more thriller than usual. The mystery is interesting and complicated. The story is intriguing and grabs you quickly. The writing is pleasant, as always. I wished it was a bit shorter, but at 336 pages the length doesn't seem outrageous. Overall, this was very enjoyable and my favorite by this author so far. Can't wait until the next.",

While the end is interesting (agreeing to keep secrets) the conclusion was at a very different pace than the rest of the book with little time for development of motives or insight into character.
