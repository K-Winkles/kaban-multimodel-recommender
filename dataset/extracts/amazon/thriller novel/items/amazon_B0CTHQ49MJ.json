I knew I was in for a roller-coaster ride when I came to the end of those first few pages. And it didn't let up\u2014there where multiple times that my heart was racing just like the characters' were. So intense and scary!Like a lot of other thrillers that I have read, there are so many twists and turns to the storyline, as well as being full of those characters that you aren't sure if you can trust. Who is the bad guy, and how can he really be that evil? So many questions and doubts. But Steena has woven a story that is impossible to figure out until you get to the end of this exciting story and everything you thought you knew is wrong.I love this dark side to Steena's writing that we've been seeing lately and these dark stories of hers just keep getting better and better. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!I highly recommend The Sister Under The Stairs! If you're up for an amazing thriller, this is definitely the one you should dive into.",

But other times, I\u2019m feverishly reading through pages to see what happens next. Trigger warning because of sensitive subjects but not as hard to read as some other domestic violence based books I\u2019ve read like, BA Paris\u2019s Behind Closed Doors book.",
