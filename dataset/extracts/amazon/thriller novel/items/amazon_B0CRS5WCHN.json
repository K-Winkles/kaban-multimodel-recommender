                "reviewText": "In her first, previously unpublished book, Ellis takes us into the realm of the possible, though maybe not probable world of someone who sees and learns to interpret auras. These auras are emitted by every living thing in an array of colors and reflect much about mood, health and state of mind. In addition, she introduces a character, recently dead, who appears as a friendly and helpful \"ghost\". With this as the premise, she spins a tale both interesting and entertaining. The prose is beautiful, the plot well constructed and the characters full and rich--like the books in her several series. What she has learned since this first book is focus and streamlining. This first novel has many characters and action that is wide ranging making the book longer and more diffuse than it really needs to be to tell the story. A few subplots could have been omitted with no harm done to the overall book. It leaves this book as a long, slow read without the sense of urgency one more often finds in a mystery. It is still enjoyable, however, and an entertaining peek at Ellis' origins as a writer. I look forward to the sequel and more about the lovely aura reader and her friends.",

Can't wait for the next volume. What an incredible gift Ellie has. Great read!",

                "reviewTitle": "Joy Ellis at her best",
                "reviewText": "My initial thoughts upon starting this book are that it\u2019s absolutely amazing. It is a deeply mystical and somewhat magical story. The amount of research that this author has undertaken to dig deep into the world of reading the auras that people supposedly exude is admirable. This is something that I have heard about before, and it is certainly extremely interesting. Although there is no apparent scientific evidence that these auras exist, there certainly seems to be quite a number of people who have the ability to read them. Joy Ellis has clearly taken the immensely exciting decision to immerse herself in this idea and has created a delightful and exciting story around it. The book itself is cleverly written and is indeed an absolute joy to read. The mixture of the apparent supernatural abilities of a young woman in her quest to assist the police in an urgent hunt for a psychotic killer, make a perfectly intense and compelling read. The ending is just fantastic although desperately sad \u2013 well it certainly made me cry. I am now wanting more of this exciting world I have been introduced to and I\u2019m looking forward to the next in the series which I have already ordered. The wonderful thing about this book is that it was written 20 years ago and never published before, which I find hard to understand. Thankfully Joy\u2019s current publishers had every faith in this novel, even though it was so different to her normal stories. It has proved to me, more than ever, that Joy is one of the best authors around and I simply love reading her books.",

It is the first book she ever wrote. Ellie was involved in a car accident late one night and on recovery she has a special gift, the gift of auric sight. She stays with a very dear friend, Carole, for her recovery and is helped along in this regard by some other people she eventually holds very close. Murders of young women are being carried out by a serial killer and Ellie\u2019s help is enlisted by the police. I would never have believed it was Joy\u2019s first book. It is very well written, unpredictable, clever and grabs your attention. It is very hard to put down. I look forward to the next book. Unfortunately there will only be the 2 books in the series.",

                "reviewText": "This first novel lay in Joy's attic, unpublished for many years despite her many successes since then in the police procedural genre. It's so clear from reading this book that writing was deep in her soul well before she began in earnest. Of course, since then, Joy has become a bit of a legend but it was lovely to read this first attempt which I thoroughly enjoyed. It's really two stories which eventually merge - which makes it quite a long read compare to her other books - but both stories are so well written and weave together wonderfully towards the end when I could hardly put it down. As always in Joy's books, the characters (apart from the baddies obviously) are really lovely people and this is something that makes for a very cosy feel to the stories even when they are dealing with gruesome subjects. I look forward to starting the next in the series and hope that Joy will consider writing more as I'm keen to read how Ellie continues to use her gift as she learns to master it.",
