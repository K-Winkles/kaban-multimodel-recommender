        "description": "New York Times best-selling author C. J. Box returns with a suspenseful new Joe Pickett novel. Nate Romanowski is off the grid, recuperating from wounds and trying to deal with past crimes, when he is suddenly surrounded by a small team of elite professional special operators. They're not there to threaten him but to make a deal. They need help destroying a domestic terror cell in Wyoming's Red Desert, and in return they'll make Nate's criminal record disappear. But they are not what they seem, as Nate's friend Joe Pickett discovers. They have a much different plan in mind, and it just may be something that takes them all down - including Nate and Joe.

The concern is that the project leader is a foreign-born but American-raised Muslim who might be planning a terrorist attack. But Nate knows the man is a falconer like himself and is favorably impressed when he finally meets him. Yet Nate is haunted by a terrible dream he has had about dying in the desert. Terrible danger awaits Nate and Joe and terrible events unfold. Many gruesome scenes make this book not for the squeamish. And Nate plays a bigger role than Joe which was an interesting change of pace, although not one I\u2019d be keen on seeing repeated any time soon\u2014Nate is too brutal a character to be someone you want to spend a lot of time with. Nonetheless, for sheer fright and excitement, this book is highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I saw George Martin - the Svengali behind the Beatles Music - quoted somewhere once, he said something like \"I missed out on royalties for most of the Beatles recordings but I'm happy with what I've got. I look at a man and wonder are you a 'good' person? It's love and family that matter most in this life\". I see something of this philosophy in the work of C J Box and which is one reason as to why I both like and enjoy his writings.\"Off the Grid\" seems to me to have a pretty much more complicated, albeit fascinating plot than previously for a Joe Picket novel though I read it with my usual great pleasure. [As an animal loving vegetarian I do wish he'd ease up a bit on his description of hawks turning their prey into a mush of blood and feathers however!:-) ] I had expected publication a few moths earlier than the actual day of its release so perhaps there had been a problem with the plot? At any rate I was a bit confused only for a little while with \"Ibby\" - a gentleman of Middle East origins - being the surrogate leader of a band of Middle Eastern, obviously terrorist thugs.C J brings all the loose ends together just as successfully as usual though and I'm looking forward to the next book in the Joe Picket series coming out in early 2017.",

                "reviewText": "I stumbled across this book and recalled another CJ Box book a few years ago which I thoroughly enjoyed. \u2018Off the Grid\u2019 didn\u2019t disappoint and I think what makes this author\u2019s stories so engaging is his characterisation and in this age of superheroes in super-costumes it\u2019s refreshing to read of an ex-military hero capable of ripping the bad guy\u2019s ears off with his bare hands whilst still ensuring his hawks (peregrine, red-tail and gyrfalcon) are fed.Nate Romanowski has the true warrior mentality, and Box shows an understanding of this in that although Nate doesn\u2019t really want to kill anyone anymore he\u2019ll do so in a heartbeat if it\u2019s the right thing to do, and he will feel no guilt about this. It won\u2019t bother him. No post traumatic stress disorder for Nate, he just wants to be left alone. But he has a past, and once the FBI (or whoever they are) discovers his whereabouts they promise to make his past disappear if he\u2019ll complete just one more mission.Nate trusts them as far as he could throw them, but understands that he has no choice.I loved the description of yarak \u2013 which I understand comes from the Persian y\u00e2rak\u00ee (power and boldness) and the Turkish yara\u011f\u0131 (readiness) \u2013 and which refers to a trained hawk in proper condition for hunting. The peregrine falcon sees its prey as \u201cthe one true thing to the exclusion of everything else,\u201d and it\u2019s with this sense of yarak that Nate enters into battle with the enemy as the \u2018one true thing,\u2019 just like peregrine.",

                "reviewText": "Joe Pickett has grown older and his cases lead him from accidental murder in his home region to being some kind of special agent for Govenor Rulon - and this time he has to deal with islamic terrorism. Still, the author manages again to stay away from stereotypes and simple solutions. The overall message is Joe - his love of nature and his view of humans as part of a natural circle. Apart from that the novel is a breathtaking thriller, introducing Sheridan Pickett as a new hero and leaving enough loose threads for more stories which I can't wait to read.",
