Winstead splayed out inner secrets so raw and really put out how we carry baggage we tell absolutely no one about, even our closest friends. She laid out in detail how that pain, those secrets, rip apart families and friendships. The prose in the book was almost poetic to me. Heartbreaking and brutal.Would give it \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f on the mystery and the whodunit alone.

However, Winstead did such a fantastic job writing a flawed person that I began to understand and sympathize with her. All the characters are shown to be written in a mix of being centered, ambitious, broken, overachiever, competitive, and authentic self-destructive people.In the end, though I was not surprised by who the killer was, I found that I could understand Jessica, Coop, and the rest of the group. I enjoyed this book and will be reading from this author again.",

                "reviewText": "In My Dreams I Hold a Knife was a decent read from start to finish. I was a bit nervous at first because I thought it was going to start off slow, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are things that happen in the beginning that made me intrigued. I was always wanting more. I needed more information in every chapter. Which, in the end, made this a super quick read for me.Jessica is\u2026something else. I didn\u2019t really enjoy her character, but I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. She has all the confidence in the world, but at the same time, she has no confidence at all. She always needed everyone else\u2019s validation and I hated that for her. She was through some things when it came to her father. He wasn\u2019t very supportive and that had a huge impact on how she viewed herself.Honestly though, even though Jessica wasn\u2019t \u201clikeable\u201d I still wanted to learn more about her, and at times, I was rooting for her. The question is\u2026did I make the right decision? Should I support her? You have to read the book to find out.There are so many twists and turns throughout the whole book that you really don\u2019t know who to trust and who to believe. The ending had me absolutely shocked. There was a slight moment that I was right, but then I changed my mind and was like, \u201cNo way.\u201d Although I may have thought of the person once, I did not think of the why/how.There\u2019s actually a bit more information once we find out the whodunnit. That information is wild. Even though this book won\u2019t go down as one of my favorites, it was still a good read. You should pick it up because of the many twists and turns and how it continuously keeps you on your toes.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cMy life was a narrative I couldn\u2019t parse, full of conflicting evidence.\u201dFor a while, it was quite comforting, perhaps strangely so given the genre, to always have this book to return to to break up what I was otherwise doing, especially amidst finals. I relished in being part of this world that tilted slightly, dangerously, on its axis, drawing suspicion towards every character by the end. With the thought that each was imperfect, damaged, and at most turns messy, but definitely, undeniably, twistingly human. Author Ashley Winstead just does it right. She exacts from each character turmoil and powerfully unearths the shameful, ugly parts that they desperately wish to keep hidden from others. There were also little, surprising undertones of dark humor woven in, which only strengthened the story and made me just unabashedly feel and feel deeply and pensively.\u201cBut in a flash, a vision of torn blond hair, sticky and red, matted against white sheets. I shook my head, pushing away the glitch.\u201dNow, for the actual story: Jessica Miller, the narrator, breathlessly, urgently craves perfection, always has since college where she meets and becomes part of the coveted East House Seven, which includes herself, Mint, Caro, Frankie, Coop, Heather, and Jack. With each of her new friends, she feels all at once armed with a different sense of belonging and place, but also views them as prizes to shamelessly show off, her association to them further cementing her level of status and prestige, both of which she is relentlessly, addictively after and always yearning for. However, of all of Jessica\u2019s friends, I had a soft spot for Coop, who was filled with grit, original, no-nonsense, and all about knocking the Greek system and its toxic exclusivity. I loved every inch of him for that. However, regardless of his words of wisdom to Jessica to forget markers of status and focus, instead, on loosening up and enjoying more, she can\u2019t help herself, she is primed, by other factors and most rigorously herself, toward becoming something greater than what she believes she is.\u201cHe took my face in his hands and looked me in the eyes. How terrifying, to be truly looked at.\u201dSo, regardless of reason, does Jessica\u2019s obsession for perfection eventually go to her head and get the better of her? Do one of her friends have a vengeful, dark side they may be covering up? All these questions barge to the forefront as Heather is brutally murdered and the case eventually goes cold, with evidence, but not enough, pointing to Jack, her college boyfriend, being the main suspect. However, don\u2019t you know, that he must be too simple, the low-hanging fruit for the real perpetrator to frame. Hence in using an effective flashing between present and past approach, Winstead puts all these characters, now called back in modern day for a college reunion, right on center stage, as each feels the heat in new and pressing ways to confess to how they could be related to the crime on that fateful, terrifying night. I loved every minute of this richly fleshed out story as doom and elitism clashed in new and interesting ways that pierced through me and held me captive.",

                "reviewText": "Six Friends.One college reunion.One unsolved murder.\ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\ude31In My Dreams I Hold A Knife is a debut by Ashley Winstead that seriously packs a punch! This book had all the elements which I love and I was completely absorbed and devoured it. But not too quickly because I wanted to savour all the juicy details \ud83d\ude09. The college setting/reunion, dual time lines and characters which you kind of hate but love at the same time, plus an unsolved murder = winner for me. As with all \u201chyped\u201d books I avoided reading reviews or the synopsis when I got the book and just went in blind so I had no expectations. And I loved it! If you\u2019re a fan of dark academia, plenty of drama and a layered story which peels away beautifully with each page, give this a read.I seriously had a book hang over after this one.This was a perfect summer read!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "This was one of my most anticipated reads of this year. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it after seeing some bookstas raving enthusiastically about it.I have to say that I was not disappointed.If you love academic thrillers, you can't miss out on this one.I loved the dual timeline which is very well done in this book as we follow the reunion of former college friends (minus a dead one) today and the story of what really happened ten years ago.First of all thank you @mariesembar for buddy reading this with me and explaining everything I needed to know about sororities and US colleges. I would have been lost without you. We follow Jessica Miller who is determined to steal the show from everyone at her reunion with her once closest friends at the elite Duquette University. Today she is a successful woman, well dressed and nothing like the lost girl she once was when her roommate Heather was murdered and her life sealed forever.At the time, everyone was sure that Jack, Heather's boyfriend, was responsible for the murder, but the police could never find any evidence. When the group is unexpectedly confronted by Eric, Heather's brother, who is still looking for answers, it quickly becomes clear that each of them had the means and motives to kill poor Heather. So, if Jack is innocent, what really happened that night?I wouldn't classify it as a locked-room mystery, but even without Eric's accusations, it's clear from the start that one of these 7 people must be Heather's killer. Trying to figure out who is telling the truth and who is weaving a lie is what sucks the reader in.I couldn't quite give it 5 stars because the characters' voices seemed very childish to me. Even though they were now in their thirties, their voices and behaviour felt more like that of a teenager.But a part from that, this was a solid thriller which I can only recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Oh, my, goodness! The hype for this book was real, and it was not misplaced at all. This was my favourite book of November \u2764\ufe0f.This book is told in duel timelines: then and now. The two timelines are interwoven together perfectly to slowly drip feed us trickles of information that kept me guessing until the very last pages... I constantly had different theories, and everyone of them was wrong. In the end it was shock after shock after shock.I loved the character development in this book. Every character felt so real and was so deliciously flawed that I was enthralled. The East House Seven characters are a bunch of liars, cheaters, stalkers, drug dealers, and drug addicts. Their strong friendship bond consists of lies, betrayal, and rivalry.The other thing I loved about this book is how well timed every single twist and turn is. Some of them left me gobsmacked. I loved this wild, action packed, trickery, whodunnit premise so much and devoured it at one sit!I think I may have a slight crush on Coop, he is just the perfect bad boy made good!I liked going back and forth between different timelines which give enough clues about characters\u2019 motives and perspectives. Especially last two flashbacks involving Jess\u2019 birthday party with her family and and her talk with Heather where do they see themselves ten years later were the best flashback chapters of the book shook me to the core.This is a must read!Synopsis:Ten years after graduation, Jessica Miller has planned her triumphant return to University, down to the envious whispers that are sure to follow in her wake. Everyone is going to see the girl she wants them to see\u2014confident, beautiful, indifferent\u2014not the girl she was when she left campus, back when Heather\u2019s murder fractured everything, including the tight bond linking the six friends she\u2019d been closest to since freshman year.But not everyone is ready to move on and not everyone can let Heather\u2019s murder go unsolved. Someone is determined to trap the real killer, to make them pay!",
