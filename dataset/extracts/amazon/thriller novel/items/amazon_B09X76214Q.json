The recent James Grippando novel Code 6 takes on a big issue with sympathetic characters. Code 6 focuses on the daughter of the CEO of a major technology company. The father in a troubled marriage has deep affection for his smart daughter who ultimately is central in unwinding the mysteries of both historical and present-day misuses of big data and the global implications. Murder, kidnapping and other plausible outcomes ensue as the reader races along with the characters and follows the threads that go back to Nazi Germany and forward to today\u2019s census. Code 6 locks in as an intelligent and compelling story.",

The characters came to life. It makes you wonder what happened after they went to coffee.When you\u2019re interested in the characters lives offstage, it\u2019s the sign of an engrossing story that sucks you into the story and leaves you wondering about them as if they were real.",

                "reviewText": "CODE 6 by James GrippandoCODE 6 is an intricately created technothriller that forces the reader to question how much of our information gets into the hands of governments and companies. Grippando was extremely skillful at building the layers of the story to add the tension and heightened suspense needed to propel the events forward.What I liked the most about this crime novel is the characters. There is a human element front and center. If not present, it would have made this book far less compelling. The way the author uses Kate and Patrick\u2019s reactions, as well as their emotions, adds value to the narrative. However, it is not just these two that ground the story in a very real place. All those present throughout these pages add to the moments of peril, action, and at times, a brief levity.Of course, the central theme is technology and data sharing. Grippando does a good job of not making it too detailed or overly techy. The reader is able to grasp the problems at hand without having to have a scientific background or know too much about the technology behind the programs. It is approachable and yet, still informs the reader about the history behind compiling information and its effects on society today.All in all, this CODE 6 does not hit you over the head with high action but it does pull you down the rabbit hole with Kate in a way that is addictive.",
