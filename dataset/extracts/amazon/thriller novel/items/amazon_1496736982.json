                "reviewText": "This book may have actually been a four star read. It could possibly have been a five.The writing was good and the story was even better.But we\u2019re all familiar with the old fable in which a kingdom is lost for the want of a horseshoe nail, right? The same concept applies to a book filled with small errors, throughout.\u201cShe diverted her eyes from his\u2026\u201d\u201cShe released the break and the car rolled\u2026\u201d\u201cLivia politely rebuked his offer\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was a genuine startle, where nearly every bone in his body jerked\u2026\u201dBeing a grammar Nazi isn\u2019t my bag, but misspellings and awkward descriptive words are jarring to the reader. The entire flow of the story grounds to a halt because we are forced to back up and reread the passage, (losing momentum and interest) attempting to correct these errors mentally.Is \u201cbook editor\u201d even a thing anymore? Even the major publishing houses are printing books that are an embarrassment to this country in terms of grammar and sentence construct.I hate when a really good book, such as this one, is relegated to one or two stars, because the author was cheated of a decent book editor by their agent and their publishing house. You are better off hiring an English major at a nearby college to help with your manuscript, than allowing your work to be published by a company who doesn\u2019t employ a good book and story editor.Either that, or spend the rest of your writing days on Kindle Unlimited.",

                "reviewText": "The plot and character development was excellent. In addition, the author must have performed research on forensic and medical examination, with interesting descriptions of autopsies and the routines \u2018fellows\u2019examiners have it go through. The clues left pointed to several persons, leaving the reader guessing as to who the killer was until near the end. However, there were some typos and errors, e.g. the word \u201cimplement\u201d was used when the correct word should be \u201c implicate\u201d. Sometimes too, the sentences used were somewhat cumbersome. I have the feeling that the story was written in a hurry, especially the end. I would give this a four and a half star if I could.",
