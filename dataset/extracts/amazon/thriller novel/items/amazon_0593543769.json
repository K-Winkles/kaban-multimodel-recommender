                "reviewText": "{3.5 stars}Sometime in the future, bringing people back from the dead is a reality. We don\u2019t get the specifics, but people who have died can be cloned, and their memories returned to them with the exception of their death. Lou is one of those who have returned. It was reported that she was the victim of a notorious serial killer and we see her try to grapple with what happened to her and identify with the other survivors. The book is mostly about a new mother and her relationships, as well as the recovery from trauma. As she tries to get all the information she can about her death, she realizes that there may be more to the story.This was a \u2018like,\u2019not a \u2018love\u2019 read for me. As someone who is not a mother, I feel like I have read way too many books where postpartum and the exploration of what it is to be a new mother is a theme. I don\u2019t want to say that it doesn\u2019t work for me, but perhaps that I am just a bit tired of it. I really liked the murder mystery parts, and the exploration of a serial killer. The survivors group, and the game re-creating the murder were pretty interesting. But the twist was a bit of a letdown for me. But I think that might be a me thing rather than it just being a boring or disappointing twist. I still enjoyed the telling of the story.",

                "reviewText": "This mystery has an excellent and clever plot and the well written main character keeps the reader engaged throughout. The idea of a murdered person being replaced by a clone\u2014with all the deceased\u2019s memories intact\u2014is beautifully and believably presented (with plenty of the reader\u2019s willing suspension of disbelief) and the novel never falters in its premise. The reluctance of the protagonist\u2019s baby to accept her new mother is a poignant thread throughout. The suspense builds expertly as the protagonist gathers more clues regarding her murder. However, I gave the book only four stars because the ending is shaky. It comes rather abruptly, relies too much on the exposure of a conspiracy and, most importantly, rests ultimately on the premise that (spoiler alert!) a loving mother would walk away from her child.",

An unreliable narrator can be revelatory. This reveal just made me feel tricked. If it had been more enticing to read it with more attention I might have enjoyed deciphering the clues but frankly it wasn't so I didn't bother.I read this for a sci fi book group otherwise I never would have picked it up as I am not a fan of mysteries. It was marketed as similar to The Echo Wife which is everything this one is not: compelling, thoughtful, deeply critical of marriage and motherhood, brutally feminist, gut wrenchingly honest in its betrayals.My Murder is just meh. It takes ambiguity to a new low.",

I'm not big into sci-fi so it was a bit different for me, but liked that the sci-fi element wasn't too far fetched and still comprehendible.However I did find parts of the books dragged out far too long and I didn't really form a bond with the protagonist or any of the other characters. I didn't find the style of writing overly engaging so would end up skim reading bits that I felt were long winded.",
