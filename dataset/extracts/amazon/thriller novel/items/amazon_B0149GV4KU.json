I have a sister and I can\u2019t imagine something like this happening to my family. I try to be spoiler free in my reviews so I just want to say the villain is as sick as they come, the healing the families have to go through is inevitable, and the corruption of people who are supposed to protect us just rage inducing. I know things in real life probably happen like this and it\u2019s just incredibly sad to think about. I would definitely recommend this book, I would probably read it again.",

While extremely disturbing at certain points, the author takes you on a journey you want to see through the end. I\u2019ll need at least 3 simple, sweet beach reads to cleanse the images from this book\u2019s story from my memory. Part thriller, part family drama, and ultimately just disturbing. I haven\u2019t read a book like this, ever. Not to mention, I have never used the dictionary tool as many times as I did while reading this book.While I feel like I would have loved some better monologues and details of the psyche and emotions of Claire and Lydia at times\u2014Paul is an extremely interesting character and doesn\u2019t seem to far off from people lurking in the IRL. At points it felt drawn out and at times vignettes moved too much at surface-level.Recommend this but prepare yourself to not know how to feel and to be captivated by such disturbing imagery and plot. Your mouth will hang open at times.",

                "reviewText": "PRETTY GIRLS [2015] By Karin SlaughterMy Review Five Stars*****I was already a fan of Karin Slaughter's novels two decades ago when I was renting books on tape to \u201cread\u201d during the extensive driving that was required by my job at the time. It was more recently (2018) that I decided to read both her GRANT COUNTY and WILL TRENT series in chronological order. A few were re-reads but even those were exceptionally entertaining. Slaughter quickly ascended to the list of my top five authors on the planet Earth. I was \u201cblown away\u201d by the sheer power of Slaughter\u2019s works, and as I commented in a review of her debut novel BLINDSIGHTED [2001] she is the author that set the new gold standard for excellence. I had already read the entire WILL TRENT series before I began the earlier GRANT COUNTY books. She did not stop writing after half a dozen novels, or continue to write but with diminishing returns. We refer to \"Early Cornwell\", \"Early Patterson\", \"Early Koontz\".. and at least in my case \"Early Stephen King\" for a reason.The NYT Bestseller PRETTY GIRLS was released six years ago but it was the first standalone novel I\u2019ve read by Karin Slaughter. It was so riveting that I would have stayed up all night to finish it if I hadn\u2019t had commitments. Even so, I finished it in two sittings. I absolutely LOVED it. That was hardly a surprise to me. I have commented in the past that I become so completely mesmerized by her novels that I become almost oblivious to my immediate environment. I think there could be a tornado roaring like a train, a home invasion in progress, or a house fire blazing and I would still be holding my Kindle in a death grip reading her words and turning pages. She has the power to invoke what I like to refer to as \u201cimmediacy\u201d. As a reader I feel like I am right there in the moment.This doesn\u2019t need to be a long or wordy review. Amazon has logged 8642 ratings so heaven only knows how many readers rated this bestseller on Goodreads. I just looked it up and the answer is a whopping 205,017 (to include 18,548 reviews)! Tess Gerritsen, also among my top five favorite writers, commented that Slaughter is \u201cOne of the boldest thriller writers working today\u201d. Translated that means that Slaughter does in fact \u201cwrite with a razor\u201d and her characters and scenes cut to the quick. If a reader doesn\u2019t want to encounter raw realism and brutal reality, then stay away from Slaughter. Her works slice to the bone and deliver a visceral punch to the gut and a precordial thump to the heart that sends our emotions in freefall. Like Gillian Flynn has been quoted so often \u201cI\u2019d follow her anywhere\u201d. I have to read the rest of her standalone works on my Kindle. I intentionally wanted to parse them out to prolong the thrill, but PRETTY GIRLS was so d--- great I\u2019m not sure I can wait.The most impressive characteristic of Karin Slaughter\u2019s works IMO is that the creative genius she possesses does not seem to give any indication of waning. Her ability to take the reader into the darkest most depraved minds and acts of sadistic predation on women sets her apart from anyone writing today. She doesn\u2019t hesitate to \u201cpull the trigger\u201d on the sickest and most shocking scenes with forensic details that are not for everyone. Slaughter\u2019s peers are writing crime fiction that tackles the same underlying theme of violent crimes against women, and their works include riveting thrillers that knock my socks off. It isn\u2019t that the works of giants like Gerritsen and prolific authors like Hoag cannot deliver the goods on this theme. There is just \u201csomething\u201d about Slaughter that goes where no mainstream crime fiction queen has gone before. Gerritsen called it \u201cbold\u201d and I think that\u2019s putting it mildly.I have to say as I am ready to post my own \u201ctwo cents worth\u201d that I am surprised by not only the number of negative reviews I see but also by their relevant fervor about the visceral impact and graphic depiction of violence in PRETTY GIRLS. This is a small percentage of readers when you consider the whole of course. In any case, I find it annoying those readers post reviews saying they cannot bear to finish the book\u2026that there ought to be warnings about the content, and so on. Good heavens. If you don\u2019t want your emotions and your sensibilities to be stripped raw then don\u2019t read Karin Slaughter\u2019s works.",

It almost never lets up, but keeps you captivated.As an Atlanta native, the references to the city were a fun nod even if they did feel a bit crammed in there at times (i mean seriously, she practically does an unrealistic tour of the perimeter the entire book). Loved this, will definitely read more from Karin Slaughter.",

I didn\u2019t see any of it coming. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would because it absolutely deserves it. I cried at so many points in this book and I can count on less than one hand the amount of times a book has moved me to tears. I\u2019ve been estranged from my family. I know what those complicated feelings are like. It felt like my family was getting closure from fictional characters. It broke me.

Gripping from the beginning. Writing style is fast paced & characters draw you in. Some scenes are quite graphic but leads to more suspense & reveals the horror of such attacks and the story is better for it.",
