        "description": "\"Reader Vacker does a remarkable job voicing the main characters and keeping the tension high....Mystery and true crime fans will be drawn in and ultimately satisfied by this complex, tense tale read expertly by a talented narrator.\"\u2014Booklist\"[Karissa] Vacker switches easily between the higher female voices and the lower male voices, creating recognizable and believable characters.... Listeners will enjoy a gripping and twisty story.\" (AudioFile on Earphones Award winner A Flicker in the Dark)Following up her instant New York Times bestseller, A Flicker in the Dark, Stacy Willingham delivers a totally gripping thriller about a desperate mother with a troubled past in All the Dangerous Things.One year ago, Isabelle Drake's life changed forever: her toddler son, Mason, was taken out of his crib in the middle of the night while she and her husband were asleep in the next room. With little evidence and few leads for the police to chase, the case quickly went cold. However, Isabelle cannot rest until Mason is returned to her\u2014literally.Except for the occasional catnap or small blackout where she loses track of time, she hasn\u2019t slept in a year.Isabelle's entire existence now revolves around finding him, but she knows she can\u2019t go on this way forever. In hopes of jarring loose a new witness or buried clue, she agrees to be interviewed by a true-crime podcaster\u2014but his interest in Isabelle's past makes her nervous. His incessant questioning paired with her severe insomnia has brought up uncomfortable memories from her own childhood, making Isabelle start to doubt her recollection of the night of Mason\u2019s disappearance, as well as second-guess who she can trust... including herself. But she is determined to figure out the truth no matter where it leads.A Macmillan Audio production from Minotaur Books. Read more",

                "reviewText": "I gave this domestic thriller 4 Stars!SUMMARYThis is quite a story. It starts out very sad, Isabelle\u2019s baby Mason has been kidnapped and a year later there are still no clues as to what happened to him. It has been effected every aspect of her life. She and her husband are separated, she cannot work. She cannot function. She spends all her time searching for him, she speaks at conventions and has turned her house into search headquarters. Literally can do nothing else. She doesn\u2019t sleep, she has accused a couple people of being involved. She doesn\u2019t come off as very stable.To make things even more complicated, she grew up in a house that was a civil war hospital at one time and it may or may not be haunted. And her baby sister died mysteriously when they were very young.Some people, maybe even the local police wonder if she had anything to do with Mason\u2019s disappearance.Desperate and sleep deprived, she meets a true crime podcaster who wants to feature her story. As they work together, she starts to see things from a different point of view and begins to doubt everything she thought about the kidnapping.WHAT I LOVEDThis book had everything I like, in a thriller. There was an old historic home that was potentially haunted. There was a solid mystery with some good twists and turns. The characters were three-dimensional. Even the heroine of the story definitely had some gray areas in her life. I love a story with some very complicated relationships. This one definitely had that. I loved the setting, it had a very Southern Gothic feel.WHAT I DIDN\u2019T LOVEFamily thing I can say I really didn\u2019t like about this purpose that it started out. Very sad. The first maybe 50 or so. Pages were hard to read and I almost gave up. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because the story stopped focusing just on how desperately sad Isabellle was, and started to get more into the mystery and suspense.OVERALLI would definitely recommend this book to anybody who likes a nice twisty roller. Just be prepared for the beginning to be sad and hard to read.",

                "reviewText": "A story about about a mother's desperate attempt to find her missing son who'd been abducted one year earlier from his bed in the middle of the night. All the while battling severe sleep deprivation and guilt as well as coming to terms with her crumbling marriage. As if that weren't enough, repressed secrets from her past threaten to break her..I love the authors writing, it can be very poetic. The short chapters make the storie feel fast paced, though I'd say it's more medium paced. There is enough mystery and enough questions that I just couldn't put this down. I had my own theories but they proved to wrong and there was a surprising twist which I always love. I feel like the story was wrapped up nicely in the end and left no loose ends..I read the authors first book, A Flicker in the Dark, and jus couldn't pass up reading this one. I'm glad I did! I will definitely be reading more of her work in the future!",
