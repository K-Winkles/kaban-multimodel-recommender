Personally, I\u2019m tired of the loose-cannon, corner-cutting cops who buck the system. OPEN CARRY is a refreshing, respectable read. It has an interesting plot that openly carries the reader quickly from one page to the next. It is the perfect bedtime book for our current sub-zero nights.",

This is a very good beginning to the Arliss Cutter series. We get to know US Marshall Cutter, his deceased brother\u2019s wife and kids, whom he is helping out, and many other characters that he works with. He has many life rules he follows, learned from his grandfather \u201cGrumpy.\u201d I sure wish we could have met him as well, but I feel like I know him because Arliss thinks of him often.I fluctuated between 3 and 4 stars while reading this because it bogged down a little in the middle of the book. However, the last third of the book had me quickly turning the pages. Because of that and knowing how good the second book is, I have bumped it up to 4 stars. I\u2019m anxious to keep on reading these for the mystery that plays out among the beautiful terrain of Alaska, be it land or sea.",

He has been able to create realistic Alaska State Troopers, US Deputy Marshall\u2019s, and local law enforcement officers.

With the wild Alaska wilderness as a backdrop, there was nonstop action and thrills!",

                "reviewText": "Not a lot of gunfights or slug-outs here if you are looking for non-stop violence, but if you want that stuff added in as a spice to the overall book, then you will be satisfied. Cutter is an old fashioned sort of guy but not in a dumb way or sexist way. He is just veiled in his emotions, but when he lets loose on a really bad guy, watch out! The opening scene is crazy!There are also some of those scenes where he sets right some young punk being a smart ass, and I always find those fun.Not a lot of mystery here. You get chapters of Cutter and his people working and you get chapters of the bad guys being bad. Of course they converge at the end.I like the characters here and enjoyed watching them in action and interacting with one another. I would say give it a try. I think the people and their motivations in here are more complex than the people in a Reacher book. I also like the way the author does not use the worn out BS of the noble guy who is faithful to the memory of his one true love......... until a bikini walks by.Good characters, good dialogue, action, a bit of violence here and there.... Give it a try!",

Always a roller coaster ride, navigating through each chapter. After reading the book, it made me want to pay a visit to wild, mostly uninhabited Alaska! I want to meet its peoples and learn more about its heritage. The story was quite unique and as the title to my review says\u2026I couldn\u2019t put it down!

                "reviewText": "... ein blasser US Marshal Arliss Cutter, der lieber Suppe kocht als auf M\u00f6rderjagd geht. Dazu eine etwas strange anmutende Beziehung zu der Frau seines verstorbenen Bruders und seiner Kollegin Lola, die ihrerseits eine etwas strange anmutende Beziehung zu ihrem Mann, dann Ex-Mann unterh\u00e4lt. Mmmh.Die Dialoge sind langweilig, ohne Esprit und Creativit\u00e4t. Die Story d\u00fcmpelt vor sich hin, nimmt nie richtig Fahrt auf, obwohl sie in einer der atemberaubensten Landschaften der Welt spielt, in der ein fl\u00fcchtiger Kidnapper Unterschlupf bei einer Film Crew findet, ein Cartel Drogenboss der \u00fcbelsten Sorte sein Unwesen treibt und nat\u00fcrlich, ein Storm im Anmarsch ist. Aber Arliss Cutter kocht Suppe oder schnitzt, weil er nachdenken muss.Dem Plot fehlt das Leben, die Identifikation mit seinen Helden, die Sch\u00e4rfe der Charactere, die Action und der big final shoot-out. So sind es beschriebene Seiten, mehr nicht.Schade. Schade. Schade.Auch wenn das jetzt kein pageturner ist, gebe ich Arliss Cutter noch eine Chance. Vielleicht \u00fcberrascht er mich, vielleicht auch nicht. You never know.",
