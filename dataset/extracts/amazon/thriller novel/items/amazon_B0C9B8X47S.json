They are so diverse and so well described that is doesn\u2019t leave me wondering what the character looks like. And all their backstories are so meticulously crafted I can\u2019t even explain how much I enjoy learning about each one of them. It leaves you having a deeper connection and over all appreciation for the character. And 2) is how different each plot and story line is in each book. C.C is full of creativity and you never know what to expect! Please read this series! You won\u2019t regret it!",

                "reviewText": "When I got this book, I was ready for more of Holly and her gang. I truly feel they have become my friends and I want to know what is happening with them. I love reading about how the relationships between all the characters are developing.This story was full of action and suspense, with some fun relational moments mixed in.I love CC Warrens\u2019 writings. She packs so much into her books and of course, Holly gets into the most interesting (and sometimes life-threatening) situations.In this book, there are some dark moments battling the evils of people mixed up in cults. It shows the strong pull cults can have on a soul.CC Warrens is a gifted author. One of the things I appreciate about her writing is that she\u2019s not afraid to speak the truth. She wove moments of hope and life lessons throughout this book. Lessons like reaching out to God when it feels like things are out of control and out of our hands. God has got it all in His hands and timing. When it feels the darkest, He\u2019s still there with us!If you love books that will keep you spellbound until the very end, then this is one for you!I highly recommend you pick this book up and read it.I was given this book by the publisher which did not influence my review in any way, all thoughts and opinions are my own.",
