                "reviewText": "It is hard to find really good books that keep you enthralled, and I have bought many that were mediocre, and some that I just could not even finish. When I started reading Dustin Stevens, about Reed and Billie and then Hawk Tate, I was so happy to be so engrossed with Dustin Stevens' writing, and his books, that when I finished those series I was very sad that I couldn't continue reading Stevens! I love his writing, and he knows how to string words together and how to make you feel as though you are THERE!Now I found this book, Ham, and found it to be absolutely breathtaking, and could barely put it down! Thank you Dustin Stevens for this series, which has me so happy in reading them! Ham is an interesting and an admirable person who is a valiant heroine! I continue on now with the other books in this series.So long as you write books I will read them, and you make multitudes of us happy. Also, your generosity in making them affordable is very appreciated, too. You uplift us now when we have had dark times in America, and for that, and for your brilliance in writing, you are our hero!",

                "reviewText": "This book is a masterful work of suspense. You are drawn into the story right from the first page and the tension just builds from there. At times my fists were clenched and I was holding my breath wondering what was going to happen next. Dustin is a master at painting a scene. You can visualize every single detail. The characters are very well written, with just enough back story to give you a sense of their personalities and motivations. Ham is one tough, dedicated heroine. If I am ever in trouble, I want her on my side. This is a great story and I would definitely recommend this book. I am looking forward to reading more by this author.",
