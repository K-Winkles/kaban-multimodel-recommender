The story is told in first person narrative, so there are not long, drawn out scenes to develop characters. The plot gets straight to the point and doesn't stop. Some people may view the elements of the plot as somewhat simplistic and unrealistic in spots, but it was the lack of deep complexity that made it work.",

They found Jesus right where they left Him. Waiting for His children to come back to Him. Evil is real but so is God\u2019s protection over us. A great reminder that when we believe Jesus honors our faith in Him. Also a great reminder that when a person can\u2019t speak he can hear. So speak peace and believe. I loved this book!",

It's the very definition of \u201cpage-turner.\" I was hooked from the first sentence to the last.I liked Hale instantly. His narration was very engaging. I loved how strong his faith was. Despite everything he was going through, it never wavered. Talk about inspiring! I was glad he had a friend like Gilbert. His belief in Hale, his loyalty, and the way he still treated him so normally (unlike some other people) was so nice to see. On the other hand, Hale\u2019s stepmom was a nightmare! Cruella de Vil was quite an apt nickname for her.If you\u2019re looking for an exciting and faith-filled thriller, grab a copy of this book. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
