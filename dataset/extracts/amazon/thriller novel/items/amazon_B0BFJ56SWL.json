                "reviewText": "This book wins for amount of times \u201cMm\u201d is said in different dialogue scenes to the point that it subtly grated on my nerves. I, however, much rather enjoyed Milena\u2019s perspective than the main character Anna\u2019s. There was a tenderness and a human vulnerability to Milena, even if she is a little meek and submissive at times, unlike Anna who remains mighty high on herself and quite unlikeable in moments.The ending is inconclusive and every character unreliable to the point that the reader\u2019s grasp on reality, too, is challenged. I thought that that was the most effective and original as truth, perspective, and someone\u2019s general positionally is subjective and can constantly be called into question and interrogated.Every year, Anna, her fianc\u00e9, Henrik, and good friend, Milena, go hiking deep in the mountains in Sweden, but this year it\u2019s different. Milena wants her boyfriend, hiking and outdoors aficionado, Jacob, to come. Reluctantly, Anna and Henrik agree with some hesitation as there\u2019s something strangely, eerily familiar about Jacob to Anna that she can\u2019t quite put her finger on. The more that time goes on the more violent things and characters become. Jacob is an all-around wildcard and while the story dragged a bit midway through, I thought closer to the ending really had me. If you enjoy action and outdoors thrillers this one is a decent read and had me hanging my head in despair at the tragic outcome of one of the characters and what could\u2019ve been.",

                "reviewText": "It's been a long time since I've been blown away by a book I've read. Well, consider Jack effectively knocked off his feet!Ulf Kvensler's \"The Couples Trip\" is (IMHO) a spellbinding tale of two couples who go on a long hike through the Nordic wilderness. Although the author captivates us with intricate descriptions of the countryside's spectacular scenery, the real story is revealed as the couples' relationships decay into something far more sinister than mere petty bickering. It's well to embrace the old maxim \"all is not as it appears\" as you course through the pages of this book. Justifiably, this book was bestowed with the Swedish Academy of Crime Writers' award as \"Best Debut of the Year.\"Read - enjoy - then ruminate over the literal feast presented to you by a true master storyteller named Kvensler.Move over Michael Connelly - there's a new boss in town.",

But this year everything is different.For starters, Henrik is less than enthusiastic to go. Helplessly watching his academic career fade away, he can\u2019t muster the motivation to train for the hike.And Milena is bringing her boyfriend Jacob, who neither Anna or Henrik know.When the two couples set off for their hike, Muriel\u2019s new man suddenly commandeers the getaway and plots a new course. One that will require tremendous skill, adding even more danger to the hike. Question: Is everyone up for this? I think not!As the hike begins and the altitude increases so does the tension between the couples. Is it too late to turn around before someone gets seriously hurt?This was an atmospheric read, allowing me to just sit back and lose myself in the magical beauty of the Swedish mountainside.I listened to the audio and Karen Cass did an amazing job of bringing the characters and storyline to life!My only drawback was the ending. It left me confused and feeling like something was left out or possibly lost in translation. I needed more clarity and closure.",

Also thought it was a very easy read with only four main characters.Some have given lower ratings due to ending but I think it really opens up lots of thinking and room for discussion. My partner and I read it at the same time. We concluded that we would never know who killed Jacob but Milena made sure Anna took the blame. Anna tried to save Milena and Milena even confirmed that. If Anna had murdered Jacob, as opposed to killing him in self defense, she wouldn\u2019t want to leave a witness. And if Milena killed him, to save Anna, Anna would again try yo save her friend\u2019s life.",
