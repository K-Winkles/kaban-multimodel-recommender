Prologue PROLOGUE Those months, the months before she disappeared, were the best months. Really. Just the best. Every moment presented itself to her like a gift and said, Here I am, another perfect moment, just look at me, can you believe how lovely I am? Every morning was a flurry of mascara and butterflies, quickening pulse as she neared the school gates, blooming joy as her eyes found him. School was no longer a cage; it was the bustling, spotlit film set for her love story. Ellie Mack could not believe that Theo Goodman had wanted to go out with her. Theo Goodman was the best-looking boy in year eleven, bar none. He\u2019d also been the best-looking boy in year ten, year nine, and year eight. Not year seven though. None of the boys in year seven were good-looking. They were all tiny, bug-eyed babies in huge shoes and oversized blazers. Theo Goodman had never had a girlfriend and everyone thought maybe he was gay. He was kind of pretty, for a boy, and very thin. And just, basically, really, really nice. Ellie had dreamed about being with him for years, whether he was gay or not. She would have been happy just to have been his friend. His young, pretty mum walked to school with him every day. She wore gym gear and had her hair in a ponytail and usually had a small white dog with her that Theo would pick up and kiss on the cheek before placing it gently back down on the pavement; then he would kiss his mum and saunter through the gates. He didn\u2019t care who saw. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the powder-puff dog or his mum. He was self-assured. Then one day last year, just after the summer holiday, he had struck up a conversation with her. Just like that. During lunch, something to do with some homework assignment or other, and Ellie, who really knew nothing much about anything, knew immediately that he wasn\u2019t gay and that he was talking to her because he liked her. It was totally obvious. And then, just like that, they were boyfriend and girlfriend. She\u2019d thought it would be more complicated. But one wrong move, one tiny kink in the time line, it was all over. Not just their love story, but all of it. Youth. Life. Ellie Mack. All gone. All gone forever. If she could rewind the timeline, untwist it and roll it back the other way like a ball of wool, she\u2019d see the knots in the yarn, the warning signs. Looking at it backward it was obvious all along. But back then, when she knew nothing about anything, she had not seen it coming. She had walked straight into it with her eyes open. Read more"

She was fifteen, the youngest of three. Beloved by her parents, friends, and teachers, and half of a teenaged golden couple. Ellie was days away from an idyllic post-exams summer vacation, with her whole life ahead of her. And then she was gone. Now, her mother Laurel Mack is trying to put her life back together. It\u2019s been ten years since her daughter disappeared, seven years since her marriage ended, and only months since the last clue in Ellie\u2019s case was unearthed. So when she meets an unexpectedly charming man in a caf\u00e9, no one is more surprised than Laurel at how quickly their flirtation develops into something deeper. Before she knows it, she\u2019s meeting Floyd\u2019s daughters\u2014and his youngest, Poppy, takes Laurel\u2019s breath away. Because looking at Poppy is like looking at Ellie. And now, the unanswered questions she\u2019s tried so hard to put to rest begin to haunt Laurel anew. Where did Ellie go? Did she really run away from home, as the police have long suspected, or was there a more sinister reason for her disappearance? Who is Floyd, really? And why does his daughter remind Laurel so viscerally of her own missing girl? Read more",

As a mom this was a hard book to read, because it literally is a nightmare for me as a mom, your daughter who you love, suddenly disappears and there is no trace of her. For years, they tell you that she has probably run away, but you know that couldn\u2019t be the case, there is something wrong. Years and years go by and as the rest of the world and your family move on, even your husband, but you still have a missing piece of your heart, questions left unanswered.

I am glad I bought the recorded version that I would listen to at night. It took a bit longer to complete. It helped this American with the British/Irish fiction story. There are definitely some cultural things that helped me by listening to the recorded version. The different accents made it so much more interesting, as well. The plot was twisty and I was not expecting where it ended up. A good story and I will definitely be looking forward to reading more by this author. Definitely will purchase the recorded version.",
