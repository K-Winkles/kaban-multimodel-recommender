                "reviewText": "Kubica certainly knows how to create nail-biting suspense and unrelenting dread. The story starts with a jolt of adrenaline. Lily confesses to her husband, Christian, that something terrible has happened. She was attacked in the park. Fearing for her life, she struck the man repeatedly with a large rock and was able to flee. In her panic, she drives home, instead of going to the police. Worse still, her attacker was their friend and respected neurosurgeon, Jake, husband to Nina, Lily\u2019s colleague.Meanwhile, Jake hasn\u2019t come home. Nina\u2019s worried because they\u2019d had a particularly heated fight the night before and both said things that she wished they hadn\u2019t. She figures that Jake just needs time to calm down. Days pass with no word. Nina thinks that maybe Jake has finally left her. They\u2019ve been going through a rough patch in their relationship lately. Nina\u2019s been caring for her ailing mother, and Jake feels neglected. When the hospital calls however, Nina\u2019s alarm skyrockets because Jake loves his job and would never do anything to jeopardize it.So where is he? Jake\u2019s disappearance baffles Nina and terrifies Lily and Christian. Lily last saw him angry and bloodied at the forest preserve where he physically assaulted her, but she didn\u2019t notify the authorities. Is Jake still out there now, full of vengeance and wrath or is it something much worse? A series of increasingly bad decisions follow, inexorably linking Jake, Lily, Christian and Nina in a twisted maze of deception and terror. Lily recoils at the thought of what might be true, and Nina pushes forward, intent on finding her husband.Kubica has crafted an intricate and riveting tale. The constant momentum is impressive. I felt Lily and Christian\u2019s palpable anxiety every time there was a knock at the door. I cringed when Christian\u2019s behavior became even more reckless and impulsive, but understood his desire to protect his pregnant wife from the dangerous web she was entangled in.This was a great book that I genuinely enjoyed.It\u2019s a propulsive read that\u2019s pensive, too, and that is no small feat. While turning pages in a flurry, I found myself contemplating as well. The idea that one decision or traumatic event can set off a cacophony of life-altering choices is sobering. Each character thought they knew themselves and each other, but were shocked and surprised when unforeseen circumstances tested their resolve. Highly recommend the book. The ending is masterfully done.",

                "reviewText": "This was... okay? I've never read Mary Kubica before, and this was chosen as our book club selection for the month. I went in completely blind. I read no reviews, only a brief synopsis of what it was about. It sounded okay, like something I would read occasionally. I do enjoy a good psychological thriller from time to time.We have 2 main couples in the one. Lily and Christian, and Nina and Jake. It's told through Nina and Christian. I went between audio and my Kindle on this one, and the audio was okay. I actually did enjoy the back-and-forth perspectives of each side of the story. Nina's husband Jake went missing after a fight one night. She doesn't think too much of it until his work calls and says he hasn't been to work. Since he's a neurosurgeon, he doesn't miss work. Period.On the opposite side of that Lily is acting strangely at home. Christian finally pries it out of her, and she explains she ran into Jake while out walking. And something bad happened.A lot of blah blah blah back and forth throughout the entire book and a few storylines that could have been completely left out. I felt like it could have been shorter. The twists we mostly all predictable until the very last one, but it honestly didn't come as too much of a shock.Not sure if I'll give this author another shot or not, but we will see.",

I've read previous Maria Kubica books that I've liked (but not one I've loved yet). This one was very meh. The storyline was pretty ridiculous and not in a mind-blowing kind of way. One of the main characters did so many stupid things that I wanted to jump into the pages and punch him. And again, not in an exciting and fun way. Just like \"why did you write it like this?\"Save your time and money and get a different book. I definitely don't recommend this one. Gave 3/5 because I did finish it and it was easy to read.",
