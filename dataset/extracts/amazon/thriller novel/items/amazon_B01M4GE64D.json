                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Not my favorite...",
                "reviewText": "I am such a Nora Roberts fan. I have read nearly all of her books through the years. She's a fantastic storyteller. I know her books tend to have patterns, familiar plots, character types, themes, etc. However, she tells a great story. She entertains you, makes you care, gives you a satisfying journey with real heart and humanity to it. Having said all of those things, I still have to rate this book 3/5 stars for \"just okay.\" It was not one of my favorites.There are plenty of reviews that summarize the plot so I'll skip to the point. The core problem with this book for me was the jarring imbalance created by juggling two storylines so different in tone. Usually, this author manages to weave storylines adeptly. This felt less like weaving and more like juxtaposition, and it didn't work for me.The JD Robb books are dark, gritty. The heroine in those books, Eve, has a horrifying childhood, and it's dealt with in a beautiful manner as she grows to understand who she is and how far she has come from that terrified child. They include mysteries, and a beautiful love story of two wounded souls finding each other. This book reminds me of that series in the sense of not shying away from the topic of abuse.This book, too, has a character (Alice) who deals with horrific abuse. However, it's presented in a series of powerful, gut-wrenching, detailed flashbacks. It's very dark, so dark that it's difficult to read at times. Alice's journey is powerful, and it's well written, but it takes over the book in a way that shoves everything else to the side.On the one hand, you have a story of two characters falling in love. There's a lightness to it that is wonderful and enjoyable. However, when I read a scene where a character is making lists and mundanely doing daily stuff, and then jump to an absolutely gut-wrenching emotional scene of horror for another character, & then back to mundane two fun people falling in love, it's like whiplash. The contrast is so great that I couldn't get into the love story. I was still gutted by Alice. How can I care much or feel much about the light banter of a couple when another character's abuse is being powerfully described, in detail?If the book was solely Alice's journey, it might have worked better for me, or if the book was solely the love story. However, to jump between the two stories lessened the impact of both in a sense. It just didn't work.Nora Roberts had a storyline in Montana Sky with some similarities to this one. There was a serial killer in that book and he killed women. It was horrific. The difference, in my opinion is the level of detail. In Montana Sky, a character is introduced well enough that we care when something bad happens. However, the level of detail is brief enough that we don't identify with the character or know the character well enough to be gutted by it entirely. There is not a lot of time spent detailing the violence either. The deaths have an emotional punch but it's not that hard to transition back to the main character's concerns and viewpoints. That book is what I'd term a love story (actually three love stories) with a mystery (suspense elements). The focus in clear. The mystery is important in that it affects the characters directly, but there's a balance & purpose to it. It's clearly the story of three sisters coming to terms with their pasts, forming a family, and falling in love with their heroes. The serial killer portion serves that story rather than detracting from it.This book takes the time to truly put the reader squarely into Alice's horrific journey. You get to know her, root for her, and are anguished when she suffers at the hands of a madman. She's really fleshed out as a character and the level of detail on what happens to her is hard to read at times. That suffering is intense. Nora Roberts knows how to move an audience and she does. Powerfully.However, when the story then switches to the love story couples, it feels unreal. Boring and mundane. The difference in the emotion level is too great. We've gone too dark to go that light that fast. I never felt like I knew those couples very well, perhaps because I knew Alice at such a strong level. They felt a little flat or not as fleshed out. I didn't care about them as much, maybe because I couldn't get into their every day comings and goings when the emotions were so high and so dark every time it switched to Alice.If Alice was the primary story of this book, then the couples falling in love felt almost like a silly distraction. If the couples falling in love part of the book was the story, then Alice's journey didn't serve to enhance that story or help it. It overshadowed and lessened the stakes. (Example: Sure, you're feeling insecure about your growing feelings for this guy, but ALICE is being BEATEN AND TORTURED so probably a little spat with your guy doesn't rank super high as a real life problem.) It felt out of whack, like two very different stories throwing each other out of balance rather than assisting each other.The bottom line here is that this is not one of my favorite Nora Roberts books. If you're new to this author and enjoy romantic suspense, I'd recommend starting with a different book. Try Montana Sky or The Witness. For darker, grittier mysteries with a wonderful love story, I'd recommend her JD Robb books. They're great. She's a wonderful storyteller.No one enjoys every single book by an author. I didn't care for this one. However, I gave it three stars because even a so-so Nora Roberts story is still better than a vast number of books out there.",

It's a family story covering generations who now run a resort and dude ranch in Montana. One daughter disappeared over 25 years ago this is Alice's story.If you can get past the story of Alice's kidnapping, torture and abuse it's a great read. I found myself skimming over her chapters because the horrific verbal, sexual, and physical abuse was too overwhelming.However, it's a romance in the alternate chapters mainly focusing on Bo and Cal, however also feature her brothers Chase and Rory. The description of the land, sunrises and sunsets makes them come alive. You are transported to this ranch by the author which provides a magnificent story of love, family and resilience. Just short of 5 stars due to the graphic nature. I read for enjoyment and some parts of this novel were too hard to stomach.",
