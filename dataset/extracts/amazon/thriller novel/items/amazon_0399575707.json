Initially uncertain of what she wants and hoping she doesn\u2019t want to reclaim the daughter she abandoned 5 years earlier, they soon learn their worst fears are realized. Meanwhile, a hateful US Forest Service official has arrived in town to investigate the death of another Forest Service employee but she seems more intent on blaming a group of antigovernment families who has also arrived in town than conducting an effective investigation. It turns out that, by coincidence, April\u2019s mother has been traveling with the antigovernment families which is how she arrived back in Saddlespring. One terrible unforeseen consequence follows another but Joe found an unexpected ally in a local falconer who was briefly a suspect in the first murder case. The complex tale has many twists and turns that will keep you up. Without revealing any spoilers, let me just say this is entry in the Joe Pickett series is highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Had this book on hand for quite awhile and finally decided to read it. I had read other Joe Picket books in the past and liked them so I knew this book should be just as good.Interestingly enough I was about halfway through Winterkill when I noticed that my cable company offered a new series called Joe Pickett on demand. Of course I had to binge the first seven episodes offered and was really concerned when I realized that Spectrum had withheld the final three episodes for a later drop. A week or so later those three became available and I quickly made time to finish the series.The first seven episodes, based on two early Joe Pickett books, introduced Joe and his family (dog included) and the episodes were reliably entertaining. Naturally you were left hanging and made to wait for the final three episodes. Those final three are reminiscent to the season three cliffhanger final episode of Yellowstone and were just about as good.So I recommend that you read the C. J. Box series of Joe Pickett books and or binge the Joe Pickett 10 episode series on Spectrum. Both are excellent forms of entertainment!!!",

                "reviewText": "I jumped into WINTER KILL\u2015book 3 of the Joe Pickett series\u2015without reading the two books that came before it, but there was enough detail and backstory to keep from feeling like I was missing something. The writing grabbed my attention and held it all the way through the book. The characters in the large cast rang true, and the opposing agendas that swirl around events that Joe finds himself in the center of create an atmosphere of potential chaos that is barely contained throughout the story.Joe Picket is one of those men who value family and duty above all else. Staying true to both presents challenges, but he never wavers. There are plenty of conflicts in his line of work, especially with the powers that be. As much as his superiors want to reign him in, he will not sacrifice his integrity or his sense of right and wrong.I will definitely be reading more of this series, and I was thrilled to find out that there is now a Joe Pickett series. Excellent storytelling and excellent characters you want to spend time with!",

                "reviewText": "Fantastic read which opens with you in the thick of the action and never lets you go. Also this is the book where we first meet Nate Romanowski, Joe Pickett's long term, and mysterious friend.It's winter and after the murder of Lamar Gardiner, Joe is forced to defend his actions, butt heads with rogue agents, and find his foster daughter who has disappeared.It's a well-written story which keeps you turning pages as you ride along with Joe to get to the bottom of yet another murder.But all is not as it seems and things don't become clear until towards the end of the story.It took me a couple of days to get through it, only because of interruptions. Not the first book I've read by Box, but certainly the best.No problems with recommending this amazing story.",
