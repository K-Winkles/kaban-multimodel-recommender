Haunting but never prurient\u2026truly unforgettable.\u201d\u2014Alafair Burke, author of The WifeAidan Thomas is a hard-working family man and a somewhat beloved figure in the small upstate New York town where he lives. He\u2019s the kind of man who always lends a hand and has a good word for everyone. But Aidan has a dark secret he\u2019s been keeping from everyone in town and those closest to him. He\u2019s a kidnapper and serial killer. Aidan has murdered eight women and there\u2019s a ninth he has earmarked for death: Rachel, imprisoned in a backyard shed, fearing for her life. When Aidan\u2019s wife dies, he and his thirteen-year-old daughter Cecilia are forced to move. Aidan has no choice but to bring Rachel along, introducing her to Cecilia as a \u201cfamily friend\u201d who needs a place to stay. Aidan is betting on Rachel, after five years of captivity, being too brainwashed and fearful to attempt to escape. But Rachel is a fighter and survivor, and recognizes Cecilia might just be the lifeline she has waited for all these years. As Rachel tests the boundaries of her new living situation, she begins to form a tenuous connection with Cecilia. And when Emily, a local restaurant owner, develops a crush on the handsome widower, she finds herself drawn into Rachel and Cecilia\u2019s orbit, coming dangerously close to discovering Aidan\u2019s secret.Told through the perspectives of Rachel, Cecilia, and Emily, The Quiet Tenant explores the psychological impact of Aidan\u2019s crimes on the women in his life\u2014and the bonds between those women that give them the strength to fight back. Both a searing thriller and an astute study of trauma, survival, and the dynamics of power, The Quiet Tenant is an electrifying debut thriller by a major talent. Read more",

He life is stripped from her all while hiding in plain sight. It is about the fear of escaping and the fear of staying in place. The will to fight and the real thoughts of just giving in because it is easier.It is a good read, but a hard read especially if you have trauma.Quote I liked from the book:\"Trauma is what happens after you see yourself die. You witness the story of your own death, and it rings so true that you're never the same again. You don't get it, until you do.\"",

For five years, you have made sure of it.\"I have read many kidnapping stories but this one is on a whole other level. It did such a great job of delving into the long game involved, the psychological aspect. The prose was flawless and thought-provoking.Rachel's fight and her patience during all she had to endure was both astounding and shocking.This is the story told from the point of views of the three women in this ruthless serial killer's life: his victim, his daughter, and the woman in his life...or is she his next victim.Loved it. But the ending felt rushed and a little underwhelming\u2026There were so many more questions I had. Really left me wanting.Great read otherwise.",

                "reviewText": "This book read like it was written by a personn who reads a lot of mysteries but did no real research for her own book. The premise was interesting but the execution was completely implausible. The story is told from three POVs that all had the same general tone. The bar owner/girlfriend, Emily, was simply unbearable and it was difficult to care what happened to someone who comes across as a weak minded, immature stalker who becomes obssessed with a man she knows nothing about and doesn't even really talk to before becoming infatuated and unhinged. The way she behaves in the end is so annoying that any sympathy I even tried to feel for her during the book was gone and I just wanted her to disappear. Rachel, the victim, isn't a terrible character but the circumstances of her disappearance and her character throughout are not believable in the least. Again, her character is the most like something that was created out of the author's experience reading a bunch of similiar books and then just writing one of her own without really thinking about the mindset and actions that felt natural. Chloe, the daughter, feels relatively incidental and I literally forgot about her by the end of book. I did not particularly enjoy this book but I did feel compelled to finish, The author clearly has talent and hopefully with experience she can develop a more complex and realistic experience in the future. 3 stars - good writing, plot and character development need work.",

The cover of this book, doesn't do it justice. Looks like your typical serial killer//thriller type book but it definitely isn't.I loved how we got the story from all the women and not from the bad guy. The way the chapters were written from the woman in the shed/house was brilliant, made me feel like I was her and I so desperately wanted her to escape, I was screaming in my head for her to escape at times I thought she could have so easily but the book portrayed how this guy had brain washed her and made her paranoid. Very insightful and thought provoking. Read this now!",

Not only was the POV interesting, but some of the story was told in the second person, and it worked.I was hooked the whole way through and was curious about a lot as I was reading. I really liked that as a reader, for some moments, we know what was happening without having to be directly told or for the author to go into explicit detail.",
