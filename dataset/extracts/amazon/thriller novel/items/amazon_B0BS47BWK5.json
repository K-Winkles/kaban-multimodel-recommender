One being that Austyn and Lowell dated for almost 10 years and Lowell was able to hide his evil side from Austyn that long. Also what happened to Sophia\u2019s parents? They made Sophia marry Simon and he took the Bass name and the fortune. when Sophia died and Celine took her place, why didn\u2019t Sophia\u2019s parents wonder what happened to Sophia and her baby? Did they just stop seeing her after she married Simon? Why didn\u2019t they live at the pond? Maybe I missed a page or two.",
