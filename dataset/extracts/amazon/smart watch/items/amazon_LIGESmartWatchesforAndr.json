                "reviewText": "First off it's large and thick. It it taking some time to get use to, but I think that all will be OK.The screen is bright and looks good. There is a decent selection of downloadable face graphics available so it should be easy to find something that's easy to see and understand and/or meets your particular style.The various functions all seem to be relatively accurate; certainly not Health Care grade accuracy, but at least close enough so that you can use them as a basic guideline. The BP readings may be off a couple of numbers from calibrated medical equipment but you should be able to track your trends. Same w/ the accuracy of the number of steps, distances, calories burned, etc. Perhaps not 100% accuracy, but good enough for a general personal guideline.Once you figure them out, the menus aren't difficult to navigate and the APP is also easy to work and has effective functions available that aren't frustrating and useless. The Bluetooth connection to my iPhone seems to be strong and consistent. Text notifications have come through just fine but I haven't had the opportunity to use it for phone calls yet.Looks good and, in my opinion, worth the price.",

I use the chain link arm band because it\u2019s such a neat classic design that fits my wrist nicely. There are a lot of cool features and apps on the watch that make it very equipped for everyday situations. The two main applications I enjoy are the wrist calling and music control. The only thing that I do wish is to voice reply to text messages. If you at LIGE decide to add that feature to this brand I would gladly purchase another. Thank you for your assistance with this purchase and replacement. I enjoyed the emails I received as well give the sender my regards and a raise",

                "reviewText": "A decent somewhat stylish smart watch for the price. Two bands are included. The metal one includes a link removal tool and the clasp has never accidentally come open. I\u2019ve turned all options on and my battery life is 2-3 days depending on how often I light it up. I also have the screen stay on for the max time. Your mileage may vary. All measurements are essentially based on algorithms that make well educated guesses that work well but can be influenced by your actions. If you keep your phone in your pocket, the step count will be more accurate than if you hold your phone flat in your hand for example. Most measurements are \u201crelative\u201d so only use them to give yourself an early heads up when there\u2019s a change. Blood pressure seems fairly accurate as does the heartbeat monitor. The only issue that really annoyed me was how the watch face keeps changing without me wanting it too. The App is better than some I\u2019ve seen but not up to par with, say, a Fitbit or Apple Watch but neither is its price point. And there\u2019s no subscription fee for it either. I still use my Runkeeper to record my walks but the watch counts all your steps all day, not just my exercise periods. I like it for that. At $50 I\u2019d say it\u2019s about the right price point. I haven\u2019t had it long enough to predict longevity but wouldn\u2019t plan on giving it to an heir in your will.",

The prongs are spring loaded and one of the springs has moved or broke and now it won't charge the phone. Battery seems to last, it looks great and is light weight. A fully customizable watch face would be nice but wasn't a deal breaker for me. You can customize the wallpaper, but then you can only have the time and date displayed with it.",

As mentioned previously, only the Google Pixel Watch/Watch 2 or Samsung Galaxy Watch 5/Watch 6 are compatible with Google Fi. Therefore, if you are still referring to your LIGE smartwatch, it won't support Google Fi services.Given that the LIGE smartwatch is not compatible with Google Fi, we do not have information or a solution for the issue of the device signaling for email alerts. In this situation, I recommend reaching out to the carrier support from which you purchased the device. They should be able to assist you accordingly.Appreciate your understanding!If you have any further issues/questions, please feel free to reply or contact us over chat. We're here to support you 24/7.Thanks,PrathibhaGoogle Fi SupportThe following is what I sent Google.Please confirm that my settings are correct to send signals to a smartwatch.Please note that the phone is set to notify the watch for only PHONE and SMS. We receive ALL calls on the watch but only some SMS messages. The watch vibrates for calls and also for the few text messages it receives. However, the watch dings (bell) for email alerts even though the cellphone settings are NOT set to notify for emails.",
