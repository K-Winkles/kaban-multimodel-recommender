                "reviewText": "Started at 3 stars, now after a few weeks of use I'm upgrading my review to 5.Well it doesn't do everything I want a smartwatch to do (acknowledge Duo Security prompts, have a Google voice app on the watch), it does just about everything else and does it amazingly well.Without having a Google Pixel watch to compare it to, but only an Apple watch of my partner's, I can say from my experience that this is as close as you'll get to an Apple watch for an Android device.Day 4: Google Assistant on my watch - so easy to set timers and reminders. Audio cues when running - SO nice to not have to look at my watch. The ability to download Spotify playlists and play them on my Bluetooth headphones while running - magic.Day 1 impressions:* The initial setup was a convoluted multi-step process, especially as I didn't even have a Samsung account.* The Galaxy Wearable app is faster and MUCH more useful than the Fitbit app. Unlike the Fitbit app, where there are some settings that you can only change from the watch, you can actually change settings in the app which are pushed to the watch. SO nice compared to flicking through a tiny screen to set settings.* The default band is too small for a larger wrist, so I'm already shopping around for replacement bands.* Unlike Fitbit, where everything is in one app, you need to install another app (Samsung Health) to look at health data. BUT it's looking like I won't have to pay for advanced data, unlike Fitbit Premium, which is $80 a year if you pay annually ($10/mo if monthly).* Compared to the Fitbit Sense, the Galaxy 5 battery is crap, but that makes sense considering how much more \"active\" and engaging the UI is (which is more akin to the Apple Watch). With my Sense, I only had to charge the battery every 3 days - I'm already getting a sense that the Galaxy 5 will have to be charged every day.* The UI on the 5 is SO much better than the Sense. And faster. OMG, I love this thing compared to the Sense.* So far, sleep data is NOT accurate. I know I got about 8 hours of sleep last night, but the 5 says 5 hours.* Apparently, WearOS 3 is NOT compatible with Duo Security - so you can't acknowledge Duo notifications from your watch. BOOO!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Better safety tool for seniors accustomed to wearing a watch!",
                "reviewText": "I am technology challenged and was still able to set up the basic features. My senior loved one uses a mobile phone but doesn't always remember to keep it close. They have also fallen previously and despite having their mobile phone in their hand at the time, were unable to use it to get help. They have always worn a watch so this was a great solution to give everyone peace of mind. They are still learning the hands free features, but this is a less stigmatizing, more cost effective, more natural, and a more overall useful alternative to typical senior safety alert systems. The hard fall detection feature can be set up to notify someone if it detects a fall and can be worn and allow the user to communicate hands free anywhere cellphone service is available, including the shower, without bulky extra equipment or devices one wouldn't ordinarily have. Some safety features can be set up to function automatically by a loved one even without an elderly wearer having to do anything other than charge and wear it. The battery needs to be charged more often (day and a half or so for us) given its advanced features, but it is way less expensive and more effective than alternatives. We got it for the safety tools but it also has health tracking features that are useful for everyone. It appears to have the ability to \"find my device\" which if set up properly by a caregiver might provide additional safety. I haven't actually tested that feature so do your own research. My mother loves it and I intend to get myself accustomed to wearing a watch so it might help my children's peace of mind later on when I become more fragile.",

                "reviewText": "Best Smartwatch I have owned. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, Huawei Watch 2 Sport Smartwatch, a Fossil Carlyle Gen 5, and Fitbit Charge 2, 3, and 4. THIS watch blows them ALL away!Pros:First of all, I have to point out that the Galaxy Watch 5 is so much lighter, it feels like the weight of a traditional watch. This was surprising because the battery life is so much better, this watch could run for nearly 3 days without a charge. Unlike previous watches,which at their best could only provide 1 daytime of use and needed to be recharged nightly. I can finally sleep with this watch through the night comfortably and see accurate stats for my sleep quality.It packs all the features you should expect from a Smartwatch and executes them so well. The integration with an android phone is just as easy as previous generations of Wear OS watches using the Wear OS app, but this one uses Samsung's Galaxy Wearable app. From a great little display, with UI that uses the space well while still being very informative and not an eye strain, allowing you to see time and notifications at a glance to the health sensors that can read your pulse, your skin temperature, your oxygen levels, your stress, your body composition, even ECG readings if you have a Samsung Phone as well, this watch covers the full slew of features. Notifications come through the watch as soon as they are on your phone. NFC payments are easy to use, so perhaps you can forego bringing your wallet or at least not having to pull it out of your pocket. Tracking walks and other exercise activity is easy as well.Cons:The fact you must have a Samsung phone for the ECG feature is very frustrating. The feature is built into the watch, the phone should not matter.The integration with other fitness apps and Health Connect is finicky and often requires stopping access and providing it again. Working with more fitness applications and services such as Virgin Pulse or even just better integration with Google Fit would improve the experience.Conclusion:A real smartwatch that can be used as a phone accessory and still look great while running for a lot longer than some other brands!",
