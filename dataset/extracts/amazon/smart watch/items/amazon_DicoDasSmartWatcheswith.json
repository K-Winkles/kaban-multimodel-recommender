                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It's much better than I thought it would be. It is not as smooth to use as a nice smartphone but it works, and it's not frustratingly slow/laggy. The watch has many useful, simple features that are all easily accessible.Connecting it to my phone was a very quick process. Download the app, press connect. The phone app is fantastic. Very simple and to the point. No ads on the app or the watch.The speaker in the watch is horrible so when you pair it, open your Bluetooth items on your phone and disable audio for the watch, or it will play all the sounds your phone normally would (videos & music included).It's nice not having to pull out my phone just to see if someone has texted me or sent a message through Snapchat. The band is extremely low quality and it is hard to pull it through the loops. The steps feature does work but I am skeptical as to how accurate it is. Same goes for the heartbeat monitor. All the health features are clunky so if that is your reasoning for buying a smart watch, you could likely do better with a different one.I think this smart watch is best for watch guys that just want to try out/own a smart watch. Or people who want a smart watch that doesn't look too techy. It looks like a normal watch so I don't feel like a traitor to my traditional watches when I wear it.Overall, great basic smart watch. 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Alright, folks! I've gotta tell you about this smartwatch I've been rockin' lately. First off, it's got a genuine leather strap that feels super comfy on the wrist. It's got that rich, quality feel to it, you know?Now, the body of this watch is all-metal and waterproof. Yeah, you heard that right! This thing can take a dunk and keep on ticking. It's been a lifesaver for those unexpected rainy days or if I just want to take a quick dip in the pool without worrying about taking it off.But the real game-changer here is the built-in NFC and GPS. I mean, talk about convenience! I've been using it to make payments on the go, and the GPS has been a lifesaver for those times when I'm out and about in the city.And the best part? It's versatile. Whether I'm at the gym, at the office, or out for a night on the town, this watch fits the bill. It's not just a smartwatch, it's a stylish accessory that can roll with the punches, no matter what life throws at it.So, if you're in the market for a new smartwatch, do yourself a favor and check this one out. You won't regret it!",

Unfortunately that is all the positive remarks as for the rest of the watch it is not good it would not connect to my iphone but would connect to my ipad which is ok as long as I do not leave my house. I could not get most of the apps to work because of this problem and therfore have had to return the watch. Tried it for a second time this time the battery lasted less than 24 hours not good.",
