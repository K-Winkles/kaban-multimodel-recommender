                "reviewText": "Bought this watch to replace my old one which broke. This watch is beautiful and the extra bands are a great plus. I get alot of compliments on this watch. Features are great. Only down side when connected to phone it cuts down on the volume of the phone and if it disconnects you can't hear any of your notifications or ringtones. Otherwise it was a great buy!!!",

Very stylish watch.",
