                "reviewText": "After doing extreme due diligence, I pulled the trigger during the cyber Monday sale. It includes 6mo Fitbit premium subscription at no additional charge - important feature to save your learned trends and offer insights and statistics you don't normally have in the Fitbit app without the premium subscription. AMAZING 7 day battery life for a change! Every feature works accurately as designed and specified as I tested the live EKG while at my cardiologist's office and the results were identical. I've been tracking my sleep since my first Fitbit Charge 2 and as old as that was, it was also as accurate. As someone with A-Fib, it saves sessions of arrhythmia in PDF form so I can quickly and easily send it to my cardiologist. During sleep, it measures your heart rate variability, your specific oxygen levels SPO2, your breathing rate in how many breaths per minute and does every single activity monitoring application that all other activity watches do. This is by far the best value for the market. Especially considering that if you were to try and do all day heart rate monitoring and sleep monitoring with an iWatch, it would be dead already while you were halfway asleep. On board it has Google wallet, Google maps and other applications you can add such as find my phone, other watch faces, etc. If you are looking for literally the best watch for the money, features, battery life etc, the Sense 2 is for you! I'm not a bot nor am I paid for this review; just an actual real review by a pleased customer.",

I chose Fitbit again because of the long battery life. I didn\u2019t want to have to charge my watch every day. Since I walk and bike in all types of weather, I wanted a tracker that was waterproof. The Sense 2 does everything I need.",

                "reviewText": "My old Charge 2 came with an XL band and I had it going for years until I broke the display. I needed a new fitbit but NONE of them had straps or straps available large enough to fit my wrist. I am a large man and needed the XL band that some rocket scientist at fitbit decided they didn't need to offer for a while. Seriously a lot of us big folks use the fitbit to track our progress to not being so big! Please don't put obstacles up! Anyway a friend recommended the Sense 2, and I figured it listed a band the right size so I ordered knowing I could return it if it didn't fit. Well it did, and all functions are as I expect from Fitbit. Now the bad part...The band is made of silicone and DOES NOT allow your skin to breathe. So it holds sweat against your skin not allowing it to dry off, this causes a flaky peeling disgusting rash.Thankfully the aftermarket apparently got on the stick and started supporting large bands in fabric again. So I ordered a nice elastic strap for mine and am tickled silly with it.I have a GI issue that I need to track symptoms, and since I am in the fitbit app already, it would be fantastic if they could offer some sort of freeform tracking / daily health diary in the app so I could track it all in one place.Battery life is good, not great, but good. And in typical fitbit fashion the charging adapter is anything but standard. Aside from those minor quirks though, function is great. Phone notifications are good, text messages are good except when my friends text me pics of dumb stuff...The ability to set the watch face to a design I like is awesome. I went with an analog sport watch face and love it.",
