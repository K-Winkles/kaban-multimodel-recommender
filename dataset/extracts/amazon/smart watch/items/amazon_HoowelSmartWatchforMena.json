It's even Alexa-compatible, so I can use it with my voice.This is well-made, trendy, and comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. It's a rechargeable device with an adequate battery life. For use with the watch, you must download and set up an app on your phone, although this is a simple process. The best part is there are no monthly fees to use this.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am really surprised with all the features this watch offers especially given the low price. The watch supports calling and lets you make and answer calls directly from your wrist, which is really convenient. You can add your frequently used contacts and personalized ringtone to each contact. There are many watch faces and you can even add a foto from your foto album as a watch face. The smartwatch actively tracks your daily steps, consumption of calories, and distance you walk. It also has advanced sensors to monitor your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and sleep patterns and store them in your phone. It also has integrated software that conducts daily in-depth analysis of your health and fitness progress, keeping you healthy and safe in real-time. Surprisingly, it supports over 100 sports modes, such as swimming, running, and rock climbing. What\u2019s even more surprising is battery life. I charged it fully before first use, and after 48hrs I still have 29% battery left, this is with all features on including Bluetooth, messaging, and phone calls. It even has Alexa built in. I went to the beach and completely forgot I had the watch on my wrist. I remembered to take it off after 30 min maybe, no water damage to it, even with the salty water. I freaked out because the instructions said it was not suitable for salty water. Very Very pleased with this watch. I am almost certain the current price is undervalued, perhaps purposely perhaps not but it\u2019s is really cheap for all it does. Did I say superior battery life? The bracelet is soft silicone but buckle style and while I like blush pink, I will be looking for a different bracelet so I can change the look every now and then. I am in the process of finding out the exact bracelet specs and if I can find a replacement, I will share here too.",

                "reviewText": "UnreliableI bought this watch to monitor my oxygen levels which are at a high 80% since I had COVID last year. The watch tells me I'm at 98%. (Even Apple now admits their watches can't monitor oxygen levels). I also wanted to monitor my sleep hours. If you get up in the night it considers you are up and stops recording. I also was interested in how many steps I take on an average day. I'm not shooting for 10,000 but just curious. You would be surprised how many steps it \"records\" while I am asleep! 200-300 a night! And it calculates my caloric intake without me entering any foods. It does get the time, date, and blood pressure correct and was fairly easy to connect with my phone.Don't get your hopes up with this device.",
