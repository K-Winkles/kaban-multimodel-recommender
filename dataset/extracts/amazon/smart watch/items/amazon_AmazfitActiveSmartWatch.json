                "reviewText": "Wow the Chinese got it right this time ! I was skeptical of these cheap watches as other off brand products based off name brand designs usually turn out crappy but this watch is not the case, it stands on it\u2019s own. I owned fitbit and samsung watches before but they lost me as a repeat customer, samsung watch2 claimed to be waterproof and broke due to water intrusion, not to mention newer models are not compatible with apple iphone. My fit bit was ok but the last few designs are not of my liking and i\u2019m too cheap to pay for a apple watch plus the battery life is laughable. This gem right here will do everything you need it to. Is waterproof, accurate, well designed, the app is very well done, no connectivity issues with the notifications and the battery life is insanely great i mean a whole week on one charge ! I highly recommend it. The only thing it does not do that other high end watches do is the ecg and temperature readings but at $169.00 vs $280+ they can keep it ! Well done Amazfit well done !Update !! 10/20 Two weeks in watch still works great except for the speaker. It broke by they are sending a replacement. i would suggest keep the volume low so that it last. other than that is great .",

Battery last a lot, but i think 14 days is hard to achieve in normal use with notifications and regular checking last some 7 to 10 days.",

The screen is bright and colorful. I have it set to about 15% brightness or less and I have no trouble seeing anything on the screen.2. Great OS. The Operating System is very responsive and easy to navigate. Virtually no latency when swiping on the screen.3. Long Battery Life. I have been using this watch for 10 days now and so far it has worked well. The battery is still at 46% on day 10. I even have the watch set to scan me at least once every minute.Cons:1. Extremely Poor selection of free watch faces2. Poor selection of apps3. Very temperamental when taking the stress test. It didn't have any issues getting a reading the first week I had it, but it does now.4. Soft glass. The screen is easy to scratch.5. My biggest complaint is that I CANNOT pair another device to the Zepp app at the same time as my watch.6. I have also found that this watch CANNOT have any devices paired with it other than headphones and the phone app.7. The Zepp app also does NOT allow devices from other manufacturers to pair with it.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Overall, the Best SmartWatch I've Found...",
                "reviewText": "Long term user/early adopter of Wear OS smartwatches, and everyone in my family (except me the lone non-Apple holdout) has an Apple Watch. I can definitely say that overall this is the best smartwatch I've used, and, yes, that even includes the Apple Watches.First of all, not even for one second am I going to invest in yet another Wear OS watch. I had a couple of Wear OS 1.0 watches, including one that was upgradeable to Wear OS 2.0, which basically rendered the watch unusable. I then upgraded to a Wear OS 2.0 watch only to have Google and the watch manufacturer just completely abandon the watch and the entire platform. Now Google has come out with Wear OS 3.0 as if they first two completely failed versions never existed, and want me to pay $300-500 for it??? No, thank you! So, I started looking at alternative watches like TicWatch, Garmin, Fitbit, etc., when I came across this AmazFit brand. I was immediately impressed with the features/price ratio. I had just about settled on the AmazFit GTS 4 Mini when I decided to go for the AmazFit GTS 4 instead.The AmazFit GTS 4 does everything and more that I want from a smartwatch. It has far more sports modes, better GPS system, vastly superior battery life, and more accurate bio sensors than any other watch out there I've tried. I've had Wear OS watches that allowed me to initiate as well as fully respond to SMS text messages, and frankly I found the whole process to be cumbersome and almost useless. This watch allows you to receive notifications of incoming texts, and even quick respond with pre-defined custom messages. You can also receive, dismiss, or even answer/talk phone calls. I can also receive (or not) notifications on my watch for every other app on my phone, control YouTube Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, and even download music to the watch and use bluetooth headphones/earbuds to listen to it without having my phone nearby. It monitors sleep very accurately, and all the bio sensors seem to be very accurate and reliable. Setting up and configuring the watch was much easier than setting up my Wear OS watches and getting them to work properly, and it was even easier than setting up my family member's Apple Watches.The AmazFit brand is also popular enough that you can get accessories for them, like charging docks, screen protectors/cases, watch bands, etc. -- everything that you can only get for like the Apple Watch, but can't get for the Wear OS watches because Android hardware is so fractured.So far the AmazFit GTS 4 has actually functioned flawlessly and I haven't encountered anything that didn't work or feel like I'm missing any feature(s). Simply put, it's just a great watch, especially if you're using an Android phone.One Week Update: I've now been using this watch for a full week and I still feel the same about it -- simply the best smartwatch I've encountered. In this week I've found even more watch faces and even found an online editor that allows me to create my own custom watch face. I'm running the same or similar faces to my family's Apple Watches, including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, etc. My sleep monitoring has been spot on as has my heart BPM. I'm counting steps, miles, and time in multiple apps, and I can definitely say that the AmazFit GTS 4 is as accurate as all of them. It also has identical accuracy to my wife's Apple Watch. The battery life has been superb. I walked all around Disney World for over 12 hours with the watch tracking my steps and heartbeat automatically, but also keeping track of my walking, as well as reading/answering texts, phone calls, etc. throughout the day, and the battery never went below 70%. At the end of the day my phone with its 5,000ah battery only had ~25% charge left. My previous Wear OS watches would've been dead after 6-8 hours of heavy use like that, and my wife's Apple Watch was at ~20% charge at the end of the day. Still absolutely loving this watch!",

                "reviewText": "This replaced another well-known brand smart watch I have. This watch has similar features to the brand name watch, but the battery life on this watch absolutely blows away the other one! I would get a day and a half, maybe 2 days out of the brand name watch before needing to be recharged. This one easily goes for well over a week and more. The features I really wanted were to be able to receive texts and phone calls on a watch and this does both very well. The screen is very bright and is easily viewable. It's also very light and hardly noticeable when I wear it. The band works well and is secure. This watch also charges very quickly to 100 percent. I'd buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "Funciona perfectamente, puedo recibir notificaciones de casi todas las app que me interesan (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, telegram, gmail, Amazon, llamadas. SMS) fscil de configurar y las funciones de ejercicio trabajan excelente.Tiene un sonido fuerte y claro. Me encanto eleg\u00ed esta versi\u00f3n porque al menos para mi la versi\u00f3n redonda en esta generaci\u00f3n es demasiado grande pero este esta mas equilibrado.Aun no se muy bien como activar Alexa, pero es cosa de investigar, las correas no son tan lindas pero esta versi\u00f3n era m\u00e1s barata que las dem\u00e1s y hay muchas opciones en colores y dise\u00f1os de correa para comprar aparte. El vidrio de la caratula resiste bastante, lo he golpeado accidentalmente y hasta ahora despu\u00e9s de dos meses de uso no tiene ni un rasgu\u00f1o.La bater\u00eda dura bastante con un uso normal, (tengo configurada una car\u00e1tula con un consumo no elevado de energ\u00eda y no reproduzco m\u00fasica en el) me diera hasta 10 d\u00edas y aun con poca bater\u00eda en el modo ahorra de energ\u00eda dura much\u00edsimo.S\u00faper recomendado",
