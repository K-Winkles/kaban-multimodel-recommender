The watch has many features and uses which are pretty decent for the price. I also love the magnetic charging cable. The look of the watch is attractive and not overwhelming on the wrist. Not sure how the health readings compare to the more expensive devices, but at this price point you will probably have to allow for less pinpoint accuracy. The company warns you not to wear the rubberized band too tight as it will irritate your skin. You will need to keep band a bit loose to allow your skin to breathe. Once established on trial and error, you should have no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Some time ago I bought an Amazfit 5 band. I wanted something a bit fancier, so I bought this. It looks good, although the generic face looks childish. It took more than a dozen attempts over a night and the next day to get the watch to \"bond\" (sinc) with the watch. It took a half-dozen attempts to get the watch to accept a programming update it wanted.App wants to link to the watch by scanning QR code on the watch, but there is no such code on the watch (or instruction on how to find it.).Program requires full access (constant) to my location or it won't record my exercise. I believe they intend to sell this information (along with my contacts and other information). That makes the watch largely useless because I don't want to be tracked all day every day and I don't want my contacts to be inundated with advertisements or worse.Watch is supposed to be able to help \"find\" my phone, but I find no instructions, so I assume it cannot actually do this.Instructions in the booklet are in font so small as to be practically illegible.\"App\" (program) instructions to \"bind\" (link) watch to phone refer to functions that do not exist on my Android phone. The directions on the \"app\" for connecting the phone and app are thoroughly confusing.Yesterday I walked a one mile course during the lunch hour but the app claims I only went 702 steps. The watch admits I went over 4,000 steps",

                "reviewText": "I bought this watch mostly to monitor my heart rate during workouts and tracking calories. It did an so so job. When I really got into it the watch was not registering heart rate anymore. Also - trying to do anything else with the watch while working out - not possible. You can only stop the workout, read your notification and then start a new workout. That totally throws off any data you might want to collect.The other thing that was very annoying to me is the fact that there are 4 watch faces in the watch memory. You can only add one extra watch face. I wanted a different watch face for sleeping (less bright, minimal) and a watch face with bigger letters to actually read my heart rate and steps. Not possible. Just one extra.The sedentary reminder was a joke. I just sat back down at my desk after walking around and it gave me a reminder to move. Eh. I just did. That happened over and over again.Sleep tracking was somewhat off too. If you wake up in the morning and you check your phone for 30 minutes - you were still sleeping according to the watch. When I wanted to track sleep accurately I used to wave my arm up and down a couple of times when I was awake and then check my phone, to make sure it knew I was awake ;-PNotification for messages and phone worked but were not useful to me other than having to get out my phone to see what it was actually saying or who was actually calling. The message doesn't show all the way and the phone numbers only show up if you sync your address book.In spite of saying it was somewhat small the watch felt really big on me and too much of an intrusion in my daily life. I returned it.",
