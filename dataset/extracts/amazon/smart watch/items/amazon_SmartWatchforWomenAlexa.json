This is my 1st smart watch. I feel the screen is a little large for my wrist but I am getting used to it. I think the price is great for all that this smart watch does.

I had to try over and over to make one call and I don't know why the watch decides you've hit 1 when in fact you've hit the # key -- and those keys are at opposite corners of the keyboard. My BPM and heart rate made it appear I'm barely alive. I tried the running and walking part of the app and both were totally wrong. It said I took steps while I was sitting down. The glitchy screen often ignored my swipes in every direction. There we very few choices for the watch's face. When you go to an app that's on the watch, it stays lighted for only a couple of seconds. And oh my goodness, the battery! It drained SUPER fast. As you might guess, I'm returning it. I can't afford an Apple watch and I'm done shopping for the cheap ones, so my wrist will continue to be naked.",

The watch face choices and limited (unless you want to pay for them). It \u2018dings\u2019 loudly EVERY TIME I GET A NOTIFICATION, and IT SCREWS UP SIRI! When I try to use Siri, the watch automatically comes on and I have to talk TO THE WATCH (talking to my wrist like a bad 1970\u2019s spy movie). Even then it doesn\u2019t correctly pick up what I said! I\u2019ve turned off Siri in the veryfit app and even turned off Bluetooth for the watch. It auto connects to my phone again, and I can\u2019t talk to my phone/call/text anyone unless I turn the watch OFF. When Siri comes on, my iPhone 14pro max seems to be at war with the watch, Siri misses words, or stops mid process. Also the dings are a problem because I have to keep everything on silent/vibrate for work and I haven\u2019t found a way to make it shut up! I may return it and buy another watch of my old version.",
