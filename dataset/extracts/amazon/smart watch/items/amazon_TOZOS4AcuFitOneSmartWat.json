                "reviewText": "I have been using a smartwatch for a few years and tried this Tozo watch. For price, performance and build quality it is superb. Seamless with a cellphone and doing micro-workouts during the day. Here are some of the good points of this watch:Price and ValueThe Tozo S4 smartwatch is very inexpensive compared to other comparable smartwatches in the market. About 1/10 of the cost of some Samsung or Apple smartwatches. It offers a great value for the money, as it has many functions and features that are comparable or even better than some of the more expensive watches.Design and DisplaySleek and elegant design that looks good yet feels sturdy. The screen has a high resolution of 240x240 pixels and a brightness of 450 nits, whatever that means. I just know its clear and visible in any light condition. Great selection of watch faces to choose from.Battery and ChargingLong battery life. I get nearly 7 days on a single charge with decent usage. , depending on how you use it. It also has a fast magnetic charging system that can fully charge the watch in about 2 hours. Always visible low battery reminder and a power saving mode that can extend the battery life even more.Health and FitnessWhere this things really shines is in this area. With all the sport selections and the convenience of immediate starting it is great for micro-workouts during the day. Nor heart rate monitoring strap fiddling. This convenience is worth the watch. It gives you read out of the details of the micro-workout and saves it so you can see how you did for the whole day. I tested the heart rate and blood oxygen levels against my two oximeters and they were perfect. No heart rate device that does not use a strap is going to be precise when moving. The Tozo S4 smartwatch is a great companion for your health and fitness goals. I do not use some of the health functions so cannot comment ( sleep tracker, pedometer, etc.). I like the way the watch can sync with your phone and the Tozo app to see data and trends in detail.Connectivity and NotificationsBluetooth connections and notifications were spot on. While the watch can also control your phone\u2019s music player and camera, and as show notifications from various apps that you can select from the app. I also like that it Google Assistant.Other FeaturesIt has the extra clock functions: a timer, an alarm, a stopwatch, and a world clock for five time zones. Nice.

                "reviewText": "Great smartwatch! Love the Tozo products. We have several of their headphones and the smartwatch has not disappointed. It's a great price and value. I compared functions of other smart watches and the functions on this are very comparable while saving a ton of money. The screen is very responsive to touch and movement. The colors are vibrant. The health functions are working. It tracks steps, oxygen levels, heart rate, and monitors sleep patterns. I like how it has a wide variety of great looking watch faces. You can even add your own picture to be one of the watch faces. Battery life is good and you can change the settings to save battery or use more (ie - brightness levels, etc). It just depends on how you use the watch. The app on the phone is great and connects easily to the watch (see screenshot).The call functions work great. I have received calls through the watch and I am able to talk and hear through the watch. The speaker is decent. I have also spoken into the watch for some google assistant things. Sometimes that is inconsistent. It allows media controls (pause, skip, etc) which is helpful if running or exercising with the watch. The clock functions have a timer and stopwatch. I also like choosing from the app, which app notifications on my phone to display on the app. As far as I can tell for text messages, you can only view the texts and not reply from the phone. But I'm fine with that as I don't want to try to type on the phone anyway. It's just nice to see what notifications are pinging me without having to pull out the phone.A few things Tozo could improve....It would be helpful if the time and stop watch could run in the background. You have to stay on those screens for them to run. The world clock allows you to add up to 5 cities. Again, an improvement for Tozo would be to add more cities in the search for world times. While the multitude of watch faces is nice, I haven't figured out how to change out the 4 preset faces that are stored on the watch that you can rotate through. It only lets me add and change the 5th preset. It would be nice if I could choose all 5.Other than those few things, I am very happy. I have been testing this for a week now pretty heavily. I am very happy.",
