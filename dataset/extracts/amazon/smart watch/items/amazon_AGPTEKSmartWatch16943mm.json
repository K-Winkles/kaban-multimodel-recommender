I wasn't expecting anything like apple but i did expect the product i purchased to do what it says it would.The temperature always reads the same. 73F. I am in Texas and its 99 degrees right now. It never gives accurate weather, at all. There is absolutely no way to sync any messages AT ALL. Even just to view. There is NO MUSIC function at all. No way to sync. There is NO WAY to know what the 1st icon even is for on the dash on the watch bc itsfunction doesn't work.The manual is vague and has obvious translation errors. The Q&A on Amazon is pointless because you can ask a question and they will answer YES, it works or you can do something but in fact it completely DOES NOT.I always try to do my research, regardless of product price. I know nothing is 100% perfect. I get that. But this watch does NOTHING of what it says it will, at least the main points mentioned. You can tell time, you can add a picture and maybe a heart rate, steps. THAT'S IT.BE WARNED. I read the manual and it's not a manual at all.I would not buy this product. Do more searching, I am sure you will find something better.Unless you just want a time clock and a picture, keep going.As far as the company, they shoud be 100% transparent. Alot of what they claim is I. Fact, INACCURATE.",

If you got it for the sleep monitor, then you may want to get one a little more focused on that. I have been using it and it does okay. You have to sync it to your handset and then every night before bed>main menu> swipe left twice past steps and heart monitor to the sleep monitor and make sure you do that before sleep otherwise it will not record. I also downloaded a random sleep monitor to help calibrate my watch. The ovulation and period monitoring is not great so sti I with your own calendar or your handset. Other than that. I had no issues with the temperature or it being in china time zone like others have had complaints about. The battery last for days. I bought it on the 18th of September and didn\u2019t need a charge until the 28th. It has not held the charge that long since. It does last every bit of 5-7 days. Dependent upon yourself and how often you are using it. I would buy it again before I bought an apple for hundreds! The app needs to be updated you can\u2019t add anything in the app to make it sync with the watch so just use your devices health app instead. Hope this helps some. Sorry I was all over the place with this.",

At first I thought the battery was bad, but after reconnecting it to a battery pack 5 volts 2 amp the battery charged up and it has been outstanding. I charged it on the 25th to full charge and my wife has been wearing it everyday and it's at 50% on the 30th.She likes the features of the watch and it looks good, well built.Not sure why the watch would not charge from the USB AC charger. But it just needs to have a compatible charger, the description says 5 volts 2 amp.",
