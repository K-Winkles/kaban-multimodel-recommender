It is now the Saturday of the following week, and it still has a 60% charge. Connects to my Android phone by Bluetooth so I can take calls and read messages etc. It's not like the Samsung watch I had, that had its own phone number, and I didn't have to have the phone with me. This is a Bluetooth connection, so the phone has to be nearby. Great watch though. Especially for what it cost. It comes with 2 straps and the tool for removing links on the metal band.",

                "reviewText": "The great thing about this watch for people like me with small wrists is that it comes with a tool that lets you adjust the size of the steel bracelet strap (there is also a rubber strap but they irritate my skin). The watch itself is easy to read and view things like texts, emails etc. Functions like Oxygen saturation, Pulse and BP work flawlessly (although only use these for reference). You can change the display watch face easily. Mine had 2 watch faces installed but equally easy to choose a different one from the App for this watch. I like how easy it is to charge as well with magnetic attachment which stops you attaching it the wrong way. I did have a problem with the weather but found the answer on the FAQ on the App.",
