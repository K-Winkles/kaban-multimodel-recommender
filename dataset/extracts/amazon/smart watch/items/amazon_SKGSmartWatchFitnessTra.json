Didn't want to spend the huge $ that some require, so I found this on Amazon and have been using it for a couple weeks. Still learning how/what to use; but so far - Pluses: 1) Big time numbers - very easy to read. 2) Customizable watch face to show what I want to see at a glance. 3) Great battery life - after a week of wear, it's still 70% charged. I charge it Sunday nights for the week. 4)Activity tracking with 14 activities - I use the Outdoor Walk, Workout and Elliptical. Excellent tracking. 5) Step tracking is right on. 6) Heart rate - watched it through a workout and it appears correct. 7) Veryfit app works well. 8) Documentation is pretty good although I continue to refer to the manual to understand how things work/are working. 8) GPS through the app works well. Minuses: 1) Doesn't seem able to track stress. Could be that my wrist is too hairy. Get the \"wear watch tightly\" too frequently. Funny though. Seems to do heart rate just fine. 2) Temperature doesn't refresh as frequently as I expected, and can be up to 8 hours late. Does refresh every time I look at the app; but then I'm on my phone anyway, so I may as well look there. 3) Don't seem to have all the functions listed in the manual.Note: I don't use the sleep function. Prefer not to wear it overnight.",

I thought I would find a cheaper replacement after spending all that money on the charge 5 I thought I would get something cheaper. This watch does everything the charge 5 does and more. It is easy to read after wearing it a week the battery is still at 63%. I like that it has a button you push to read the time and other data instead of coming on when you raise your wrist, but if you prefer the raise your wrist function you can set it to do that. The phone app is okay but I have a hard time getting it to connect to the watch some times. I can't speak to longevity yet, but I will when it fails. So far I like it better than the charge 5. The main functions I use it for are to track sleep, calories, and blood oxygen .",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a watch that I could use at my local pool where I walk that would count my steps and tell me if I had a text or phone call while I was in the pool, since I can't take my phone in the water.It is not very user friendly and the instructions come printed in a very light mint green which is pretty, but hard to read. Once you download the app and get it started then you can access a file that has some instructions, this time in black. Some instructions. Again, not user friendly, it doesn't fully explain itself. The app wants you to subscribe to a monthly plan, but I declined and just used the free version. The watch is large and not the most comfortable to wear. You have to keep it one finger width away from your hand but it felt very large. If it had worked I probably would have gotten used to it.You can change the watch face, and in the app you can tell it where you live and the watch will tell you the time and weather. It handled the pool really well and told me if I had a text or phone call.What it doesn't do is tell you how many steps you take. It'll remind you to walk more, so you get up and walk around, and it doesn't recognize the movement. I thought that maybe it was just user error so I asked my techie husband to see what I was doing wrong. He tried for 2 hours to get it to work, even wearing it and moving at different speeds around the house. Nope. It wouldn't work for him either.So I am sending this back to Amazon, and I'm grateful that they have such good customer service.",

                "reviewText": "Price for this item is very good - but style is sort of an issue. Watch slips around my wrist from side to side and eventually the band holding the extra strap slips up to the buckle and then you have a strap sticking out. I realize that the price drives function to a point but I really don't like the time (watch) displays you have to choose from - still trying all of them out but I have seen better displays. As with most things like this getting used to using the functions takes a little time. Had a few moments trying to start the \"outside\" walk function and then turning it off. Finally figured it out and I can make most functions perform now. As far as I can tell there is no automatic link to the phone app - you have to open the app before it will update the data on the phone. Also not sure why each function in the app wants access to my contacts, pictures and locations. I know why they want them but why do they \"need\" them. I have located another watch with a style I think I might like better at a similar price, they are on the way and I will decide soon if I return these and keep the others. More to follow....Spent about a week figuring out how to make the watch work, finally was able to get all the functions to work on the phone. But, the unit lost communication with the app on my phone. Spend a couple of days trying to get it to work again but the phone could not locate the watch and I could not get it to sync manually - strange that is was still sending my email to the watch. I finally decided to delete the app, and reinstall the app and attempt to bind the two, nothing... Finally tried to \"reset\" the watch which left me with only two screens - one telling me to download the app the other showing a QR Code. Unable to get anything to work after that. Sent two watches back (one unopened) and ordered watches from another company. As mentioned above - the band clasp kept slipping up my wrist until I had a \"tail\" sticking out sideways. Did not have a good experience overall...",

I like that you can change the face of the watch on your app. Another plus is the app is free dose not cost anything to use. I waited about year to do the review to see how it worked. It is still working. Do not recommend getting it wet, mind you never have so that's why I am saying that. So I high recommend this watch if you are on a budget. A lot of people think my watch is an Apple watch which says a lot on how it looks. So for all the reason above this watch is a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something simple to use and that had the indicators most relevant to me and I got what I wanted for the right price.My only drawback is that it doesn't connect to the Weight Watcher app the way my Fitbit used to. In order for it to connect, I had to link it to Google Fit which in turn connects to Weight Watcher's app. If that isn't a requirement for you then you are good to go. So far so good. Fingers crossed it has a long life.",
