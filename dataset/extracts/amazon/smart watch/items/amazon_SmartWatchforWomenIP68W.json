                "reviewText": "I've had a few fitness trackers over the past couple of years, and this one is my favorite for now. One of the things I like best about it is that it looks like a regular watch. The face is large and round, so it's easier to read and use the touch screen. Even though the screen is larger, it doesn't look or feel big and bulky. The band is soft and comfortable against my small wrist, and there are several notches to accommodate any wrist size. It has features that track your steps, monitor your heart rate, check your blood oxygen levels, record your sleep cycles and workouts, etc. As for workouts, there are several fitness activities to choose from (cycling, walking, yoga, etc.), but if none of them matches your activity, you can choose \"other.\" As far as I can tell, it's very accurate with my steps and heart rate, and fairly accurate at reporting my sleep cycles. (I don't think anything you wear on your wrist can be expected to break down sleep cycles with 100% accuracy; I've had previous fitness trackers indicate that I was sleeping at times when I was just very still but very much awake. This feature will give you a good baseline of the length and quality of your sleep, but that's about all.) The only (somewhat) negative thing I can say about this watch is that it's claim of being waterproof is a bit misleading. You can wear it while jogging in the rain, washing your hands, sweating profusely, and things of that nature, but apparently it wasn't designed for swimming. So I would say it's water resistant but not waterproof; don't submerge it in water and expect it to keep functioning accurately. A couple of other things worth mentioning are that you have a few different options for how the display looks, and you are able to change distance to miles and weight to pounds (the default is set to metric). Also, the mobile app is easy to navigate, and the watch battery lasts me about a week (but I don't leave it connected to bluetooth all the time). Would I recommend this watch? Yes, absolutely!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great smartwatch for those not looking for an exercise watch",
                "reviewText": "I like a watch with smart features (phone notifications, etc), combined with fitness features (workout tracking, etc.). I work in as a substitute teacher in an elementary school, so I need smart features on my watch. I also exercise regularly, so I need a watch that records heart rate, time, distance, different activities, etc.I have had the watch for 3 or 4 days now, and feel like I can give you a pretty good idea of what I like and what I don\u2019t like.I exercise 6 to 7 days a week. I live in Upstate NY, so right now, most of my workouts are done on a treadmill or on my indoor bike. I currently wear a Garmin Venu Square Music watch ($150 when I purchased it), but was getting sick of the square face, so I ordered this to check it out.PACKAGING:It arrived in a small Amazon box. In the box was a compact, nice looking watch box. In the box, there was the watch, a magnetic charger, and an instruction manual, an extra watch strap, and a small screw driver to change the watch strap (see picture). The extra watch strap was a nice surprise.LOOKS:This watch has a round face and is all black. The watch band is a silicone watch band that can be switched out with the replacement, but I don\u2019t think you could switch it out with any band that you wanted to purchase on Amazon. It has to be specific, which is why I think it came with an extra. I prefer the sport type bands that tuck under instead of on the outside, but it\u2019s not that big of a deal.SET UP/DIRECTIONS:Set up with the included directions was super simple. In fact, the only directions I had to follow were to install the app with the QR code that conveniently came up immediately on the watch. As soon as the app was installed, I just followed the directions in there and was able to set the watch up easily. The Bluetooth immediately connected, but I do have trouble keeping it connected. I frequently go in to the app, pull down to sync and get an error that says \u201csync failed\u201d. I must do that 2 -3 times to get it to work. When it\u2019s not synced correctly, I end up missing notifications. PLEASE NOTE: When I first set up the watch, it didn\u2019t give me the option to pick the Imperial system of measurement. For example, my weight had to be set up in kilograms, and my height had to be set up in millimeters. I did, however, find where to change that setting later.COMPATIBLE APPS:I like my watch to sync to fitness apps like Strava and Myfitnesspal. It does sync with Apple Heath, but I don\u2019t use that app much.NOTIFICATIONS:This watch functions very well with notifications from my phone. You can choose what things you want to be notified for and which things you don\u2019t want notifications for. I can read and delete notifications for most messages right from the watch (calendar, email, text, facebook, Instagram, messenger). When my phone rings, the watch lets me know who\u2019s calling. Calls can be rejected from the watch. There is no speaker or microphone, so you can\u2019t answer calls from the watch. I can\u2019t find a way to change the notification buzz, however. Usually, there is a setting for a lower buzz or a higher buzz.DISPLAY:The display is very colorful and clear. I have set up so that when I flick my wrist, the display turns on. I\u2019ve tried turning the screen on by just touching it, but that doesn\u2019t work. If it doesn\u2019t turn on when I flick my wrist, I have to push the button on the side to see the display. One thing I really hate is that I can\u2019t get the display to turn on when I\u2019m in \u201cexercise\u201d mode. I have shaken my arm, flicked my wrist, and flung my arm around to get the display to turn on to no avail. I have to push the button on the side to get the watch to turn on. This is a PAIN when you are exercising, especially when cycling. I have to take both hands off the bike to see the watch. There are many watch faces available, which surprised me. I especially liked the Christmas ones, but I found that those don\u2019t have many stats showing on the main screen. I like to see time, date, step count, and heart rate. There are some that have that though!!. Heart rate monitor works well. I compared it to my chest strap and found that it\u2019s about 3 to 4 beats faster than my chest strap.OTHER SETTINGS:1. Music control \u2013 works as it should. I can use the watch to start and pause the music on my phone.2. Healthcare \u2013 gives you menstrual and ovulation predictions.3. Timer & stopwatch \u2013 I could not find this at first, but when I contacted the seller, they were quick to get back to me. If you push the side button to get to the settings, then scroll down, you'll find more settings options that I didn't see at first.4. Alarms \u2013 alarms can be set on this watch.5. Sleep tracker \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t pay much attention to this on any watch, but this watch does track sleep. All info can be found on the app.EXERCISE:I\u2019ve only used this to track a couple rides on my indoor bike. I do like to run though, so I started a run activity on the watch to see what happens. It just counts down from 3 and starts. There is no GPS or ability to pair it with your phone to track GPS.There are 13 different activity modes built into the app (walking, running, bicycle, hiking, rope skipping, spinning, dance, yoga, aerobics, badminton, tennis, and other sports). I don\u2019t see any way to add different sports or to re-organize or order sports so that your favorites are at the top.BATTERY:This thing has amazing battery life. I can go many days without charging and it\u2019s still at 80%.IP68:I haven\u2019t done more than test this watch under running water, but I like the fact that I can wear it while swimming.BOTTOM LINE \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch with a great price, you really can\u2019t go wrong with this watch. It does everything that they say it does, and it does it well. I would suggest this watch to anyone just starting out with a smartwatch. That being said, if you\u2019re looking for a good fitness watch that includes GPS with combined smart capabilities, this probably isn\u2019t for you. You\u2019re better off with a watch that is specifically made for those who exercise regularly.",

Das Design ist sehr sch\u00f6n und sie hat alle g\u00e4ngigen Funktionen einer Sportuhr die man braucht, welche sehr pr\u00e4zise messen. Die Bedienung der Uhr ist sehr einfach und sie l\u00e4sst sich leicht mit der App verbinden. Was mir auch sehr gef\u00e4llt ist das der Akku lange h\u00e4lt und die Uhr schnell wieder aufgeladen ist. Zudem kann man zwischen mehreren verschiedenen Zifferbl\u00e4ttern w\u00e4hlen oder ein eigenes Lieblingsfoto nehmen. Die Smartwatch sitzt gut am Handgelenk und man merkt sie kaum weil sie so leicht ist. Au\u00dferdem ist sie sehr gut f\u00fcr schmale Handgelenke geeignet da sie nicht so gro\u00df wie viele andere Sportuhren ist. Die Farben finde ich alle sch\u00f6n. Ich habe sie in schwarz genommen. Laut Hersteller ist sie wasserdicht was ich noch nicht getestet habe, aber gut zu wissen. Diese Smartwatch kann ich wirklich nur weiterempfehlen, es ist eine Fitnessuhr f\u00fcr ein super Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis f\u00fcr den kleineren Geldbeutel. Meine Anspr\u00fcche werden erf\u00fcllt und die Uhr ist qualitativ hochwertig. Tolle Smartwatch!",

Came through the letter box, has an extra strap with it which is an absolute bargain as you don\u2019t usually get this and was really easy to charge and set up!I\u2019ve been wearing it since it came, the battery life appears to be fantastic, it\u2019s tracking my steps and heart rate well, with an added feature of measuring my oxygen level which is great. Last night I fell asleep with the watch on and it tracked my sleep pattern well which is interesting to see.My favourite feature is being able to change the watch face to a picture from your phone, there are also plenty of premade watch faves available to select so you don\u2019t get bored !I\u2019m able to control my music, and select which apps that are comparable with the watch from my phone to receive notifications for, although I\u2019m not able to reply this is great as I know who has messaged / who is calling before looking for my phone.Overall, the watch is great, absolutely amazing price and I would definitely purchase again and recommend to anyone looking for something sleek and something that works !",

Ho acquistato questo smartwatch perch\u00e9 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 piccolo e pi\u00f9 elegante rispetto ad altri modelli e sono rimasta piacevolmente sorpresa anche della comodit\u00e0 e leggerezza una volta indossato.Ha un diametro di soli 40 mm. Il quadrante e il cinturino dell'orologio hanno un design alla moda. Ha l'eleganza degli orologi tradizionali, pu\u00f2 essere utilizzato come orologio quotidiano ed \u00e8 anche un buon assistente per lo sport.Infatti monitorizza fino a 12 tipi di sport diversi.Puoi associare l'orologio smart ad uno smartphone compatibile e ricevere le notifiche di e-mail, chiamate, SMS, e messaggi delle APP social (come Facebook, WhatsAPP, Telegram, ecc.) direttamente sull'orologio.La sua scatola contiene l'orologio, un cinturino di ricambio, il cavo caricatore, le istruzioni e un piccolo cacciavite per cambiare pi\u00f9 facilmente il cinturino.Si carica in meno di 2 ore e la sua batteria ha una durata di 7 giorni per un uso normale.Molto carino il fatto che si possa personalizzare il quadrante e adattarlo al tuo umore o al tuo colore preferito.Lo consiglio sia per se stessi ma anche per fare un regalo, sar\u00e0 gradito.",
