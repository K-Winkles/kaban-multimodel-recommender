The construction of it is so nice, I was impressed with the quality as soon as I opened the box. The band is very comfortable and the watch sits on my wrist nicely.

She wanted a smart watch that would track her steps and workouts but the Fitbit wasn\u2019t enough. I bought this because it wasn\u2019t super expensive and it had free returns but no need because she LOVES IT! This smart watch is very similar to the Apple Watch in the sense that it has the big face to read texts and track workouts and all the other stuff. She is also able to answer phone calls and she comes in clearly through the watch. It has been her favorite watch so far and she said it was the best gift ever.",
