After setting it up and downloading the app to my phone, I was pretty surprised at all this little thing did. I won't say that my Doctor is going to take the medical readings from it as exact, but it does give me a close enough set of numbers to see how everything is going. I haven't tried the training portion of the watch yet but so far, I'd say that I am happy with what how it performs. The battery life is good for 3-5 days if I don't play with it all the time and it doesn't take all that long to charge. One review complained that they couldn't adjust the face. Well, it took a little looking but you do that from the app on your phone. Ended up it was easy enough. The only thing I wasn't overly happy with was it requesting access to to much information o my phone so I just said no to those I didn't feel comfortable with. Outside of that, for the price this was a really good buy.",

                "reviewText": "I have no interest in an Apple Watch for several hundred dollars, so I have been using a smart watch knock off for a while. This one replaced one that stopped working. Firstly, I will say that it does NOT come to life by touching the screen...you have to press the side button. Not a big deal but it is marketed differently. The oxygen saturation and blood pressure seem to be fairly accurate, but it you do it from your watch, it does NOT sync to the app when you open the app. The only way it appears on the app is if you do those functions from the app. I don't like that. The sleep information and steps sync up, but nothing else does. I like the face and the ease of moving between functions. Pretty easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "This watch provides many of the smart watch features seen in Samsung and Apple for a just tenth of the price of others. Battery life is about a week if heart rate setting is on demand. If set to montior heart rate continuously, the battery lasts about 4 days. I went through the app to get to another watch face since my middle aged eyes couldnt read the small numbers of the original face. Ther are many faces to choose from. I really like the blood pressure and oxygen saturation features. They seem right on the mark. One hiccup I am getting used to - the user must initiate an exercise event rather than the watch noticing the change. Also, instructions don't provide the bluetooth pairing instructions. My watch's bluetooth device name was P22D.",

See picture.The screen timeout is 1sec so better move quick when trying to figure out how to use the watch.I decided to write this review after I was watching a movie in theaters when the watch chimed telling me I reached my step goal. From sitting down. For last 1hr..Lastly and mostly importantly- worst software. Can't change the time or date and using the \"app\" is a nightmare. Sketchy app that is forced on you (I tried GoogleWear and didn't work) and bombards you with ads. Ads while in the app and ads through notifications throughout the day. Wouldn't even let me use my own phones QR scanner to setup, wanted me to download ANOTHER crappy app just to scan the code.Don't buy this in a bind like I did. Save up or just use the phone pedometer.",

                "reviewText": "Update - 12/8/22I do have a couple of updates for my review. I went from 4 to 3 stars, mostly due to durability issues. Over the 5 months I have had this watch, it has gotten scratched very easily. Granted, this was typically on the type of thing that would also scratch anything else made of glass, such as taping a painted brick wall, but the scratches also lead to a crack in the watch face. The crack is currently about 2/3rds of the way down the screen diagonally. The band also tore off. Replacement bands are easy to find and cheap, and I do wear the watch in the gym and other more rigorous activities, but still, I'm not running triathlons or anything like that. Also, and I'm not sure if this is related, but the sleep tracking doesn't always work. I can't really say why. For sure, it doesn't record naps, but also, it will decide I'm awake and then stop tracking sleep. It will say that I slept for 2 hours when I really was asleep for 7-8 hours. I would say it's good for about 8 or 9 out of every 10 days, and then has a hiccup.The watch itself still works fine and the app is still ok. Glitchy, like I said before, but it's still usable. Even with the cracks and scratches, the watch is still readable. And even though the band tore, I found another new band for $10, so it wasn't that bad. The watch does keep track of steps pretty well, which was the main point of getting it.--=-=---I bought this to count steps after a hip surgery. It does that quite well, and has added features to track sleep as well as measuring a few vital signs like blood pressure. I only charge this watch about once every 3 weeks and it charges up pretty fast.The mobile app is ok. It glitches out a bit if you don't open the app on your phone at least once a day. It has some kind of bug where it will not record your steps in the app properly if you don't open the app each day. Also, the sleep tracking seems a bit inaccurate. It doesn't always know when I am asleep, though I do think it does track deep sleep and brief awakenings well. It just has trouble sometimes determining if you are in a light sleep or awake.I also don't find the glass to be that durable. I got a small scratch in the corner and that lead to a crack that wasn't there originally. The crack is about 1/4 of the way down from the corner, though it does not seem to be growing anymore. I would not have thought that scratching the outside would lead to a crack like this. I can still read the watch and it seems to be working fineOverall, I'm satisfied. While the app and the glass are disappointing, I also only paid $30 for the watch, so it's hard to hold it to the same standard as an Apple watch.",

                "reviewText": "No estaba segura de si me gustar\u00eda llevar un SmartWatch ya que llevaba tiempo con la miband de xiaomi pero a veces me entraban ganas de llevar algo m\u00e1s elegante.Vi este a un buen precio con varias caracter\u00edsticas interesantes y me atrev\u00ed a probar. La verdad es que estoy bastante contenta. Mi novio tiene uno que es bastante grande y no me hac\u00eda al tama\u00f1o y se me enganchaba con el abrigo en invierno. Este es m\u00e1s ligero y de un tama\u00f1o adecuado, ni muy peque\u00f1o como la miband que a veces no se ve bien, ni demasiado grande. Se ve mejor a la luz del d\u00eda, tiene m\u00e1s brillo.Me gusta el gran n\u00famero de esferas que tiene para personalizar e ir cambiando de vez en cuando. No tuve problemas para hacerlo funcionar y si lo necesitas viene con instrucciones detalladas.La correa se puede cambiar en caso de que se te rompa sin tener que cambiar todo el reloj.La duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda me ha sorprendido ya que pens\u00e9 que durar\u00eda menos de una semana. Se carga f\u00e1cilmente con el cargador magn\u00e9tico que es muy c\u00f3modo.Un reloj muy completo que cumple con lo que promete por un precio econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n es una buena opci\u00f3n para iniciarse en este mundo antes de decidirte por uno m\u00e1s caro. Yo no necesito m\u00e1s funciones y estoy contenta con el producto. Lo recomiendo.",
