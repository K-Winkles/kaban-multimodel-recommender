All of a sudden i had to agree to the \"terms of service\" which I already had. All of my current information in my phone was lost and my settings were reset to factory settings.Now my watch won't automatically bind to to app. VERY DISAPPOINTING. if i can't solve this problem im sending it back.I do really like this watch. It has a lot of features i use. Love the ability to take calls and talk using the watch. No one has complained about voice quality. My basic texts come through well, and allow me to read and delete (on the watch, not phone). You have the abilty to remove permissions for other apps. good weather info.I haven't found ANY fit style watch to be accurate. But it gives me as information as good as the big boys for a whole lot less.I work in environments that have taken its toll on the faces/ screens of many watches. This one has lived with me 24/7 for almost a month with no damage.Lots of watch faces and it appears you can buy a lot more.Some are very difficult to see all the information that is displayed, but I'm sure you'll find one that works well.",

And works with Android and Apple iOS.Very impressed with this well made watch, and 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "This watch is a really good deal for the money. It's a very nice looking watch that is both stylish and functional in so many ways. The band is very adjustable so that you get a proper fit which is essential to get accurate readings for Oxygen saturation, heart rate and pulse. Long battery life, and charger connects magnetically. Software was easy to download/install and paired easily to android phone.There are a number of skins or themes for the watch so lots to choose from to suit your taste. So many sports modes which is great for accurate readings based on the activity type. Receiving and making calls was ok, but honestly can't find a reason why I'd want to do that through my watch. Notifications for social media and messenger. Keeps track of steps fairly accurately.The sleep monitor is also great. If you are having sleep difficulties it's a great tool to be able to track how much sleep you get, how much is deep sleep and how much is light sleep, and when they occurred, plus all the wake times and how long you were awake each time. It's not a replacement for decision making for a cpap machine, that really requires a proper sleep study. But as an ongoing tracker for your sleep habits, it can be very useful in determining whether you are sleeping well or combining that info with other factors to determine what might be causing sleep disruptions.My husband really likes the look of the watch and finds it very comfortable to wear. It's reasonably priced for all the features you get. Definitely makes a nice gift.",

                "reviewText": "I've held off on getting a smart watch for a while, but this one seemed to hit all the right notes for me: fitness/ sleep/ stress monitoring, waterproof and impact durable. I thought it sounded neat... almost a little too good to be true.The watch delivers which should be all that surprising given the ~90$ price tag. If you really want a smartwatch, fork out the cash and get a good one. As a veteran I get a kick out of 'military-grade' gear, but this watch is a brick, good and tough. Not sure how well it will hold up in the long run but so far it seems to be doing well under a fair bit of abuse.",
