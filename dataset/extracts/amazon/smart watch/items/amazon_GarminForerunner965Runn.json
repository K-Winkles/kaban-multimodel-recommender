                "reviewText": "The battery life on this watch is absolutely insane compared to the apple watch. I exercise at least once a day and sometimes up to four times. The Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 965 lasted over 8 days night and day with 13 plus hours of swimming, cycling, running, and lifting workouts. I think I took it off on day 8 with 20 something percent battery left. it is also feels lighter than the apple watch 8. I had the apple watch 8 and Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 965 on at the same time for the 8 days, one on each wrist. The data the Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 965 has to view is also very impressive with a very nice display.The only reason i didn't keep the Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 965 was because it wouldn't work with the apple activity for fitness, my apple watch can text, make calls, take photos with my phone, emails, ect. I think the Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 965 is a WAY better fitness watch with a CRAZY battery but it doesn't have the conveniences i am now used to with the apple watch now.If the Garmin Forerunner\u00ae 965 could do a couple things the apple watch could (text or work with the apple fitness tracking), I would 100% keep it. If i never had a apple watch and have always used Garmin or other smart watch this watch is an absolute beast. I was very impressed with the watch!",

                "reviewText": "I love this watch! I upgraded from a Forerunner 935 and the accuracy of the 965 is so much better.I'm not a huge fan of the screen going dark, so I set it to always on. This, of course, shortens the battery life, but I don't mind that too much.What bothers me the most is I can't see seconds all the time. I have to flick my wrist every 15 seconds or so to see the seconds come up. This doesn't sound like much to many people, but if you have to check heart rates all day, that gets old super fast. They can show my HR all the time, why not seconds.The sleep tracking is pretty good, but sometimes it gets confused about when I'm sleeping or not. One day I was just playing video games for most of the day. Chilling after a long hard run, you know how you do. Anyway, it thought I had gone to sleep. haha. And it doesn't like it too well if I get up 2 or 3 times for an hour at a time in the night if I need to tend to a sick or injured animal. But for most regular nights, sleep tracking seems to work.Other than that, not too much to complain about. It's a nice watch and works well in my use cases for trail running and long distance horseback riding.",

                "reviewText": "I moved to this watch from a Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar which I loved for the exercise/health tracking, sensors, and battery life *except* for the \"sunlight-visible, transflective memory-in-pixel\" screen which works great in bright sunlight and not so much everywhere else.This watch brings forward everything you like about the functionality of the 955 and add replaces the funky \"MIP\" screen with AMOLED while still having such a great battery life that it puts to shame the Apple Watch and WearOS watches.The only thing I wish Garmin would add to their watches is a utility to bring the settings forward from an older watch in a series (\"Forerunner\" or \"Fenix\") to a newer watch in that same series. I've suggested this to them.Altogether I am completely happy with this watch but expect to spend about a week fine tuning the display settings to get that longer battery life. I started with Always On and almost immediately moved away from that.UPDATE (7/6): I received the watch on June 26th and immediately topped off the battery (it arrived with the battery in the mid-90's). It's July 6th (10 days later) and the battery is at 44% with an estimated duration of another 10 days. That's 21 days of battery life. I'm very satisfied with that. This is why I'm never, ever tempted to order a WearOS, Samsung, or Apple watch.BTW, like all Garmin watches, it works great with the (Android) Garmin Connect app and gives you access to more data analysis in the app than on the watch.",

                "reviewText": "This watch does absolutely everything, the screen is beautiful, battery life is excellent and with only GPS tracking a few light activities, I was rewarded with 13 days of battery with it around 2% remaining, so quite simply put it has functioned exactly as expected. The watch body seems very light and comfortable - the silicone?? strap has perfect adjustability, and just feels \"right\". I was surprised by little things, such as the \"strength\" activity tracking actually correctly detected when I was doing reps of various exercises, and you can track metrics like weight (and others) to review and inform progress, which you can correct/edit later if an error was made. Neato.Some minor perturbances if I'm being picky - sometimes the heartrate monitor is sluggish, which is not the best when you're trying to observe quick changes resulting from effort/output in your activity compared to HR recovery time for example. Also, sometimes when you're twisting your wrist to have the screen wake, it doesn't, and you have to repeat once or a couple times more. Doesn't happen often, and if it bothered me enough and I didn't mind whatever increased battery burn-rate that equates to, I would enable the screen always on. There's more little improvements they can make, I can list a few more, but I'm sure they will update and patch a lot of this stuff throughout it's support lifecycle.All in all, such a solid product. Synced well with speed/cadence sensors, and other Garmin products like inReach Mini 2. It looks classy and is still pragmatic and functional. Doesn't look boorish. Buy it, and you won't regret it! Expensive, but what should something like this cost? It seems fair for what it does and is capable of.",

Todo bien por el momento llevo us\u00e1ndolo 3 semanas.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned 2 previous garmins. Both forerunners. They did ok. However, as my last one was coming to the end of its life, I began looking outside of Garmin. But, after lots of research I kept returning to the 965. I decided to give it a gamble. I'm so glad I did. Crystal clear display, big enough for me to read while running without my glasses, but not too big.The amount of information gathered during a run is very impressive. I like the HRV feature. I previously owned a Whoop and paid monthly for a year. This is much better. Being able to listen to music without bringing my phone along is great.The map feature is a lovely touch, as are the breathing exercise features. I run about 45k a week and I love this watch.",
