Even when you pass the app\u2019s formidable entry gate, your iPhone screen is deluged with a myriad of distracting information, relevant or not, to your health but surely to empty your bank.

                "reviewText": "it was packaged very well. that is really important to me, it tells me what quality of brand they are. it comes with two bands so that was a neat surprise. it says its ip68 waterproof and if it is, that's impressive because I use a lot of security cameras who have the same IP68 rating and they can handle basically a hail storm. so that's also very pleasant to see for such an economical price.I looked through the features and it has a lot of them. it has Alexa of course, and I can make my calls with it as well though bluetooth. it connected easily enough and stayed connected through bluetooth. the heart rate monitor works really well. I guess the technology isnt that new so pretty much every watch can do that now, but this one does it well. I was expecting less for some reason. very nice to see. it has a bunch of health modes too that im still looking through. I also think I can download extra features but I haven't looked into that yet. it also has blood oxygen monitor so that is very cool. useful when I get a flu I can see how im doing. that's a new feature I never had before. I have been using it a lot just to play with it.I love the look. looks just like a regular watch until you see it close up. I like the band too. feels nice and feels quality also. I chose the brown. the battery lasts a long time as well. and it seems pretty tough, so we will see how it holds up to the everyday wear and tear. overall a great purchase. A+",

                "reviewText": "This is really a great smart watch. The band is much nicer than most smart watches come with, which are usually some cheap looking, rubber situation. The watch itself is easy to set up, just download the app and customize for your needs. It holds a charge for a long time, and does every single thing the more expensive watches do. You can take calls and text, as well as all the fitness features, and time management options. I'm really happy with this and definitely recommend to anyone interested in getting a smart watch. You'll really like it.",
