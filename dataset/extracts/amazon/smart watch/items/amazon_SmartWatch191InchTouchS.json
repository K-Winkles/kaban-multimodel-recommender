Not just because the price is better but the functions it provides and the all-around quality are what make it a standout. I bought it on a flash sale because the price was amazing. It came in record time and when I opened the box I was a little concerned because there was not a book to tell me about the functions. But when I connected to the app and looked there at the functions it was very easy to figure out so a book was really not necessary. I am definitely recommending this watch to everyone that I know who wears one! Thank you for a quality product!",

Two main issues she has with it is it often does not notify when call/text received even though it is configured to (vibrate).The thing that irks her the most is that when using the fitness app to track a run or bike ride, it fails...a 29 mile bike ride will be recorded as 6 miles...not sure ifnphome or watch is to blame.",
