                "reviewText": "I have a Fitbit Charge 2 I've used to track my steps, heart rate and stairs for several years now, and it does a great job with that. However, I have never understood why the more expensive smart watches and fitness trackers do not offer BP and blood oxygen level measurement options also.I bought a set of ankle bands for my Fitbit and wear it there now (and get MUCH more accurate step counts than when wearing it on my wrist) and began a search for an affordable smart watch that measures BP and O2 levels.Over the past six months, I have bought and tried out six different BP smart watches from Amazon and returned four of them because of their extremely inaccurate algorithms used to calculate BP. The worst one was always at least 16 mmHg off systolically and 8-10 mmHg off diastolically. Also, the accompanying apps were nothing to write home about.I had just about given up when I found this watch, decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did! This is hands down THE most comfortable watch of any kind I have ever had on my wrist! It's very lightweight and the band is so soft and pliable I forget I even have it on! I love the style and for once, the BP readings are well within the ballpark of what my actual cuff monitor shows. I don't have an actual oxygen sat reader, but when I compared my result with the reading I got when I visited my physician's office and, it was only off by 1%.The mobile app which accompanies this watch, HeroBand III, it's also commendable. It paired easily with my Galaxy Note 10+ and offers a wealth of information that's easily understandable. I think it compares quite favorably to the Fitbit app regarding stat breakdowns.The notification feature works perfectly with my texting program and offers a list of other apps to connect to. The one that is missing that I use regularly is FB Messenger. I hope it will be added in a future software update. The weather function and exercise timer work great, too!Battery life on the watch is excellent. I last charged it on Tuesday morning, and two days later, the battery indicator shows there is a 90% charge left. I don't sleep with my watch on, and turn it off when I remove it for the evening, which could be one reason why it's just sipping it's battery charge.The only measurement that is off is the step counter. It is returning results of about 40% lower than what my Fitbit on my ankle says. I think this is just because it's worn on the wrist, so I don't really pay attention to that feature.This is easily the best economy smart watch I've used to date. I like it so much, I have ordered a second one as a backup in case the current one ever fails or if this model is ever discontinued.",

                "reviewText": "after being off and not charged for a couple of months, the watch stopped pairing with the app. I tried this on two phones, and it\u2019s not connecting. The app was trying to connect to the device but it was not possible even after a reset. The watch was showing incorrect time now (it worked fine before). It measured steps and supposedly heart rate and blood pressure. I initially paired it with my phone and it was sending notifications about emails received as long as the phone was on Bluetooth. The app automatically connected it. It was not necessary to do anything except have the Bluetooth on. But later, after not being charged for several months, the watch was not connecting. I followed the support instructions here (forget the device and re-pair with bluetooth and the app). It works properly again.",

                "reviewText": "This watch is exactly as advertized:-Syncs well with my Motorola Android phone. Software is straightforward and easy to use.This watch/counter has several great functions and options: Can change the face image, receive text message notifications, use of GPS, control my phone music and camera, etc. Impressive considering the cost of the watch.-Measurements of Steps: When walking, highly accurate. However, if doing any repetitive arm movements (like knitting), it will count those as steps as well (after completing my morning walk my step count went from 18,000 to a whopping 33,000 as I sat knitting a baby afghan). I reached out to the company and received an answer within 24hrs (excellent). However their suggestion did not mitigate the step-counting err. My solution is to simply take my watch off when knitting.-Measurements of Heart Rate: Reports while sedentary are pretty accurate. However, during active exercise, accuracy significantly diminishes (HR on the tracker never goes above 95; while manual count of HR is > than 100)-Measurement of BP: Accurate within less 5mm err. The measurements are consistent with other conventional measuring devises. *Be sure to hold still and position the watch AT heart-level to use this feature.-Measurement of Oxygen: Has a 1-2% err rate, so fairly accurate. \u2713-Measurement of sleep: Very inaccurate: There is not one single night of accurate reporting of sleep time, duration, quality by the software. I recognize this might be due to tightness/looseness of the watch band, etc and am working to try and get that worked out. With that being said, I would highly recommend a free software app \"Sleep By Android\" which is extremely accurate and helpful.All-in-all, you cannot beat this little watch/tracker and for what it does considering the price. I am extremely satisfied.",

The functions are amazing and unbelievably quite accurate, the selection of face settings is almost limitless, I get text messages and weather updates, I can control the music through my \"buds\" when out walking, it has a multitude of training settings (if you are young and fit enough), the battery life is really pretty good, (about 10 days with the functions running) it is comfortable to wear 24 hours a day if you so choose - and - it tells the time. In fact the only thing I don't really like about it is the name!! and I can live with that.",
