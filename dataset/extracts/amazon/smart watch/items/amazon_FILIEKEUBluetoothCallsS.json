The only problem I encountered was the clasp on the metal band. I reached out to the manufacture and explained the clasp didn't work to my satisfaction. They responded immediately with an apology. They explained they don't exchange just a band, but in the interest of good customer service, they could offer me a $15.00 refund so I could have the band repaired or buy a new one. That seemed fair to me and I accepted their kind offer. Credit was applied to my account, and I'll be ordering a new band. I must say I am very happy with the customer service I received from the FILIEKEU company. The watch looks great and so far has worked to my expectations. I'm happy to recommend this company to anyone.",

Learned early in life you get what you pay for, however I would have given the watch a better rating had it been made out of better material upon removing it from the package you can tell it is made extremely cheap. Just by shaking it lightly I can tell and hear how cheap it is. I don\u2019t expect the watch to last me any longer than 4 months I originally only got it to read my blood pressure which it seems to do rather accurately, aside from it being made cheap the watch does operate nicely and setup was rather easy. It does come with a tool to remove links if you need to which is nice I didn\u2019t expect that. To summarize made cheap but operates as expected just don\u2019t expect it to last long if you have an active day to day life.",
