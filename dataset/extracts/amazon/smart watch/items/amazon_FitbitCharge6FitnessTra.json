                "reviewText": "I tried a full-blown smartwatch, it had way too many useless features and a way too short battery life. I tried the fitness tracker that rhymes with Shoop and it was pretty good, but way too expensive and had no simple on-the-wrist display.The Charge 6 is a fitness tracker with limited smartwatch capabilities and that is exactly what I was looking for. The data collection appears to be very good and the app provides meaningful information based on collected data. The GPS so far has been very accurate, although you may have some connection delays if you travel.A lot of the negative reviews I've seen about this product seem to be people having wildly inaccurate expectations and/or simply not knowing how to use it. This is primarily a fitness tracker that uses heart rate data. It is not primarily a smartwatch or instantly updating pedometer.",

Also let's me see i got a text, and even let's me read it. Several other features I haven't gotten into yet, but seem interesting. So far it seems water proof enough to handle showers. Will see how it does in the pool, tho it's supposed to be good for 50 feet deep, so not expecting any probs in my pool. Will update later if it can't handle the water, but so far so good.My Fitbit Luxe was not shower proof, and started having probs, so I moved up to Charge 6.The Fitbit folks seem divided. One says don't wear in shower or pool. Another says it's good to 50 feet under water. Water proof is a deal breaker for me, so we'll see how well it does.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good improvements over the Charge 5 but broken app",
                "reviewText": "I upgraded from the Charge 5What I like about the Charge 6:- Great price- Sensors to track body activity are more accurate (I don't have a way to test this but other people in YouTube have and these sensors are really good for a device at this price point with no chest strap)- Same great battery life. I get 6-7 days (I use normal brightness, do not use GPS, have sleep mode programmed, and keep the screen off unless I need to see it).- The home button to return to the time screen is great.- Triple tapping to zoom in is nice- When it works the Google Maps app is really nice. When you launch the phone app it kicks in automatically (need to set it up this way in your Fitbit app) otherwise you have to start the walk on the phone app and then manually connect to the app from your Charge 6. It tells you where to turn and it is nicer/safer than staring at your phone. The connectivity to the Phone app however is unreliable. Lots of retries and fiddling with the bluetooth settings to get it to work. Feels like a beta. I hope this is improved with a future upgrade. I have my Charge device set to 12 hr time format but this app shows 24 hr format at the top which to me is confusing and it may be a bug. I hope this is addressed in a future update.- More exercise modes and more settings/mode- The double tapping for water locking the device seems to work a little better to me than the Charge 5.- The unit's vibration when alarm goes off seems to be more noticeable than in the Charge 5. Less likely to miss it.- Bluetooth integration with gym cardio workout machines is nice however I don't have any equipment to test this. I read that there is an issue with the encryption that Google uses. Just be aware that unless you are at a gym that has bought very recent equipment, the machines aren't likely to support bluetooth. Most hotels I workout in don't have this either. I don't really need this but some people may find it useful.What I don't like:- If you are on iOS you still can't reply to texts (I know there is an iOS security constraint that doesn't allow this but come on Google...time to find a workaround)- Like the Charge 5 the GPS is terrible. It drains the battery and it is very inaccurate. I use my iPhone's GPS tracking synced to my Charge 6 instead and it works great. If you don't have your phone with you then you are out of luck.- The biggest disappointment is the YouTube Music app. Like the Google Maps it is a remote control for the phone app. I'm a YouTube Music subscriber so I was really looking forward to this but the connectivity to the phone app is very unreliable (like the Google Maps app). You can't really see your music library, find an artist, and select Shuffle Play. All you can do is use the playback controls. (which I already have in Siri and on my Powerbeats pro earbuds), see a list of your recently played songs, and a couple of Google created playlists that I don't care to use. I really hope that they improve it in future software upgrades.- Some exercise modes have an Auto Detect and Auto Stop feature. Basically this feature auto starts an exercise mode if the device detects that you are exercising. It sound good but in reality I found it to be more of a nuisance. The device can't tell if I'm just in a hurry or warming up for a workout. If I'm in the middle of a workout and I slow down to catch my breath, the Charge 6 will ask me if I want to stop which means I'm forced to interact with the device when I don't really want to. Luckily you can turn this feature off per mode.- When you reach a new target zone the Charge 6 displays the new target zone and the number like the Charge 5 however Google has changed the number/graphic and made it impossibly small to read without stopping and staring or triple tapping which are tedious while you are moving during your routine. I hope Google improves this in a future software update.- When the device is on exercise mode the screens shows the time at the very top. The Charge 5 I believe showed the total calories burned which is far more useful, Not sure why Google messed with this. If I need t know the time I can scroll to it during my workout or I can ask Siri.- I use the timer a lot...it is still limited to 1 hour.The phone app was cool until Google did a complete redesign which a lot of users are unhappy about.I use the app and the web portal to log my food consumption and my weight. IMHO any fitness tracker is worthless if you don't track both. The app calories data is also broken. The calories left for the day count is incorrect compared to the web portal (there is a difference of hundreds of calories). This to me is unacceptable and It has been broken for months. Not sure what Google is waiting on to fix it. As a workaround if I need to see how many calories I can consume...I just look at the portal on a browser on my mac, iPad or iPhone..In spite of my dislikes overall I do like the Charge 6 and it is a nice upgrade specially for $100. The more accurate sensors are worth the upgrade. That said if you plan to upgrade because of the GPS or the YouTube Music app you may want to hold off.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Going Back to Apple Watch",
                "reviewText": "I've had experiences with Fitbit for quite some time now. I originally started with the Alta. It was great for what it was, but wished it could do more. Not long after, I moved onto a Charge 2. It mostly satisfied what I was looking for with what it offered compared to the Alta (heart rate tracking, bigger screen, navigating beyond touch, more screen real estate, etc). As much as I liked it, there were still some flaws. One of the biggest annoyances was how it would get disconnected and I'd miss notifications. That's when I went with the Apple Watch (Series 2) and haven't been back since.I had high hopes for the Charge 6 when it came out and was hoping Google would make big strides into improving what I remembered of the 2. It seemed to have all the checkmarks, except they took away the altimeter to count flights of stairs climbed. The first thing the product tells you to do when taking it out of the box is to open the Fitbit app to activate the Charge. I haven't opened the app in years so when I did, it told me to sign in. That's when I came to my first issue.My original Fitbit account is no longer valid. I was forced to migrate my account to Google and there was some issues when attempting. It wasn't very smooth and took 2 attempts. OK, after that we need to get the App to talk to the Fitbit. Which leads me to the second issue.For whatever reason, the Fitbit wouldn't connect to my phone. The App would recognize the Fitbit was nearby, but it wouldn't connect to it. I would open and close the app multiple times, along with toggling the bluetooth on/off on my phone, checking all permissions, and even restarting the phone. The app would see the device, so would the phone, but it just wouldn't connect. It finally connected after I upgraded my iphone to the newest ios (which was only one iteration newer and released a few days prior). I don't believe that's the true cause for my issue, but whatever. When the Fitbit connected, it then tried to upgrade it's firmware which lead to the third issue.The Fitbit needs to be near the phone while the firmware is downloading. The device couldn't have been more than 2 feet from the Fitbit, but the download would disconnect. The download takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, but it failed on my the first 2 times. It completed successfully on the third attempt and now I can finally start using it.Comparing this to my old Fitbits, the first thing is that the screen is beautiful. I like that it's smaller and a lot more refined than the Charge 2. I also like the fact that they have removed the character limit of text notifications (so I can see full message) and that I can go back to previous messages that were sent. This annoyed me before because what showed on the screen was only the last message truncated and if you didn't see it while it scrolled past, you can't see it anymore without pulling out your phone. You can see the past 10 notifications sent before it rolls over. I limit my notifications to only the basics like phone calls and text messages to maximize this functionality. The steps counter, sleep, and HR monitoring are what I would expect them to be. And the battery life is way better than an Apple Watch... I don't have to worry if I charged the watch the night before in order to use it.Unfortunately, the added functionality from Google is also stunted. You can't respond (preset responses) to messages unless you have Android. New functionality like to control Youtube music app requires a paid premium account. The touchscreen isn't that responsive, causing me to swipe multiple times or just not respond at all. But the final straw is the connectivity. Too many times I would miss notifications because somehow connectivity was lost and wouldn't re-establish. Usually a re-sync with the app would resolve this, but only after I noticed something was wrong.I really really wanted to like this device, but it would be too many compromises for this price. You can really see and feel the direction Google is taking with their acquisition, treating FitBit completely as secondary while incorporating the FitBit tech in their flagship Pixel watches. Especially with a $70 price cut a little over a month after release and them pulling Fitbit products from multiple countries. With all this, looks like I'll be upgrading to an Apple Watch Series 9 instead.",

I like the new features with the additional activity options to choose from and the side button that's been added back is nice as well. The off white color is a great neutral color and matches everything I wear. It's a very responsive watch the display actually lights up when I turn my wrist to check the time (Charge 5 didn't do this), it starts recording my walks without me having to turn anything on, and I can also receive call alerts and notifications. For the average user that just likes to generally track fitness metrics for consistency and motivation, the Charge 6 is great. I'm not concerned about it being super accurate as I'm not a serious athlete.",
