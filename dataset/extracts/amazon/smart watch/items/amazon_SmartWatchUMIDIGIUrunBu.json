                "reviewText": "This umidigi uwatch 2s is an improvement over the original uwatch. It's like the uwatch but with a touch screen and is waterproof. I've tested the waterproof feature by running both sides of the faces under water. I'm not sure if it's water proof when swimming as advertised because swimming under water has added pressure.This watch has many different functions including heartbeat monitor, sp02 oxygen, and blood pressure measurement. The heatbeat measurement is very accurate. I compared the values of my heatbeat by hand measurement for 1 minutes with the watch value and they are exactly the same values. I do not know if sp02 or blood pressure is accurate.This watch has different modes for popular exercise and sport that you can choose so you can get the data for exercise or sport that you actually do. I do not find them usefull but for people that do these exercise, it can be very helpful.The watch is very easy to pair with the da fit app that most umidigi watch uses. After pairing with the app, you can view the weather for up to 3 days. The watch needed to be pair with the app for updated time and weather. You can set many usefull features in the app such as notifications. Some popular apps is preloaded for notifications but if you want notification from apps that are on your phone, you select the \"other\" options. Many of your phone apps are not shown there either.There is also sleep monitoring but it only monitor your sleep pattern from around 8pm to 8am. I slept before 8pm and the watch did not monitor my sleep. I think this is a battery saving features umidigi program into the watch. If you are looking for a watch to measure your sleep not in that time frame then this watch is not for you. Another battery saving feature that I noticed is the ability for watch to auto turn on when you moved the watch up is turn off at night. I still use the watch at 10pm to 12 am so I have to manually turn it on. I found it a little annoying.I have used the watch for 3 days at full brightness and the battery is at 73%.One feature under the setting on this watch that I think should be on every watch is the compass. I compared it with google maps and it appeared to be accurate.Overall, if you want a budget watch that does the same thing as many of the high end watches and dont want to spend $100+ then this watch is for you. It does not have mobile pay nor the ability to download apps or musics like some high end watches but this watch is not design for an all around watch. It is a fitness watch. If you are looking for those features, then this watch is not for you.",

                "reviewText": "UMIDIGI Uwatch3 just got ordered to replace a Casio that had died. Everything works and overall is very slick piece of hardware. Does have room for improvement, primary is that choices for watch faces are very limited. I was hoping for an analog face with digital date/time combined which is what my Casio had, and was incredibly useful to see at a glance. Not a lot of control on how the watch face looks or what is displayed. Would be nice to have more options. (would like to turn off battery percentage and just leave battery bar).Problems in app should be renamed FAQDoes not appear to have photo taking option, kinda disappointing (have iPhoneX so maybe not on iOS?)Watch band size is nice, I have large wrists and fits fine with about 3 holes left. In the past I have had to order larger bands to even wear (looking at you Fitbit)Music control works, but play/pause button does not change visually when paused, so couldn't tell if paused or music stopped playing.Expected side button to work as a back function, but quick press does not appear to do anything, long press starts it up. (could be something missed in manual - will see if can find in .PDF as always like to have manuals accessible on my phone.Magnetic charger connection is a really nice feature, easy to use and satisfying to hear the snap as it connects.Plan on experimenting with alarm function for reminders and the like, currently hidden under device as an alert which is odd since it where you also can setup alarms, would be better as a popup on the plus button if you are going to change it frequently in app which I plan to do.Manual has extremely small text, may have to upgrade my reading glasses.Could not find information about wrist band size, I have seen 20, and 22mm listed on Amazon reviews/comments but did not see in manual. Really like to have several band options. Though I readily like that it has easy off wristband pins, nice touch.Will use for a couple of weeks and if I remember (maybe if app could set alarms out beyond a week, will setup up one in reminders and see what happens), will do a follow up about daily use, battery life and all that jazz.All that being said, initial impression is very nice overall for a basic smartwatch, with some nice features.",
