                "reviewText": "When I got this watch I was awed on how big it was both the phone and the wrist strap. The phone is solid and the strap is made to last. Besides being a phone it's also a fitness watch. As any device there is a learning curb but it's a no brainer to learn as it's intuitive. Included in the box is a charging dock, mini screw driver, two screen protectors and a simple instruction. The screen is bright enough with an awesome screen/colors and responsive and it has a camera. I placed my phone's nano SIM card and the settings worked automatically (TMobile) though it took awhile for the watch to respond to the network and the APN settings were correct. There are multiple networks that are compatible with it. A warning though, the screws that holds the SIM card cover is miniscule and can easily be lost when you're not careful. I recommend placing a white paper underneath the phone in case the screws falls off the cover so you can easily see it. Since the OS is Android 7.7.1 some apps from the play store will not work such as Netflix but it works with FB Messenger and YouTube Music. Since RAM is limited you have to choose wisely which apps you can load. When I first got the watch the font was small but there are size options under settings. This is an standalone phone and it's not like a Samsung watch in which you can pair with a Samsung phone to make and receive phone calls. I'm still exploring it's capability and so far it's positive. It's a shrunken Android phone or tablet.",

                "reviewText": "The Dm100 is interesting watch made in China and the seller had requested a review.Therefore this is my review. My review of the dm100 includes a few things including tests, test results, a * rating usually based on a max of 3*; with 4 and 5 being held for extremely great ratings and does not get used hardly at all; with that said let\u2019s get started.Imei check, I ran two different Imei checks online one had stated that the imei was last used on a kit kat os around a 4.1 android device; the new imei just checked on today 9/11/2020 stated, 1. Oukitel C1 Device and, 2. the imei number was clean. Therefore if your device is downloading all apps that allows os from beginning to 7.1.1 os that may be part of the issue; as I know that according to some reviews out there, there are users with this exact issue.Frequent (heavy) Charging, on this I can give it a 2.8* as one thing I notice is the metal on the bottom side of the watch does heat up some.Battery (Mah) verification = This one required a download application, actually I downloaded two of them to make absolute sure the Mah numbers matched and the second area I looked at is at if the mah actually matched the 2700 or 2800 Mah was advertised not only by other creators such as unbox therapy, also by many other sellers. The result of the finding is a 1.5*. As the two apps did match the mah section which confirmed it; however the downside, the mah size only shows 1,000 and not 2000 to 2800 mah.Phone Calls= 3* this is based on clarity of the call on both sides sender and receiver and the fact that you are using a sim card.SMS= 3* as well, this is based around any possible issues or complaints that I receive on not receiving messages, plus any error messages.Heart rate monitor= 3* based on weather or not it registered near the same as the application on a Samsung note 8.Stopwatch=3* watched for approximately two minutes to make sure there were no skipping which could have lowered the score.Size of watch 3*= it is usually difficult for people with big wrists to find a watch that fits, this will work well.Bluetooth 2*= I would like to see these watches be able to pair with Bluetooth instead of relying on Wi-Fi and apps such as hangouts (which only works half of the time)Turned off for long distance 3*= I wore it for over 3 hours on a round trip of approximately 65.2 miles or 104.8km, again the weight was good, no slipping around for the most part; overall seemed pretty high quality.Wrist sweat 2.5* I bet you never would have guessed that I would have included this. It is a true thing however; so I included it. Mostly once your watch heats up to some degree your wrist may actually sweat a little.Sim card installation initially 1.0*; however after the seller posted the video showing how to install 3.0*.Screw size, 1.0* Let me give you some advice here, do not under any circumstances attempt to install the sim card on nothing other than a hard service, and the lighter the color the better. And there is a good reason for it, if you don\u2019t and the screws land on a dark color surface or any carpet they are gone for good; they are just that tiny.Light water test 3* I washed my hands several times, having it turned on and off, nothing seemed to malfunction electrically, or any negative issues arose.Watch over score out of a possible 42 points scored a grand total of 33.8 or 80.47% which is real good in my book.Sellers ScoreEase of purchase 3*Customer service 5*Problem solving 5*Timely Response or explanation 5*Competitive Pricing 5*Out of a possible 23 I give the seller 23* or 100 percent.In closing Buying from this seller was a good choice, and I would recommend. Just remember one thing I almost forgot to mention about when considering the DM100, while it will cost you nearly $200.00 usd (which included an extra warranty). Additionally once the band brake (either side), the watch is done; and you need to buy another one. One new challenge that I would give the watch maker comes in 2 parts;1.Make one with the latest android and the same size screen2. Make the bands replaceable.Overall if you are looking for a time piece that is totally unique this could be a buy.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this watch just for fun, but after I downloaded Youtube Tv, and a few other smart apps. Turn on the hotspot from my phone, and just start watching tv on the bus. Just for the show off points it can be done, this watch is AWSOME. only down side is sim card data plans for the watch aren't yet worth buying into. But if you already have a good cellphone plan, and just want a smart watch that is smarter then the Apple watches, with a college degree. DO GET THIS WATCH, I recommend buying a small handheld portable fit in your pocket bluetooth keyboard, with mouse pad for it. Typing is a bit of a pain with your finger, but hey you can be watching the morning news, off your watch, while the stuck up Apple Watch users got to put their watch away in shame.",

The issue I have with this watch is the customer service is horrible. If there's any issues and you need assistance or repairs (such as needing a screen replacement), you're out of luck. I liked the watch so much I actually bought a second one after cracking the screen on the first one. I bought the 2nd watch because I couldn't get in contact with the seller about repairs for weeks. After getting in contact, I was asked to mail it back and when I did, they claim to have never received it ( months later)....so I bought another...now, I'm back to the same issue (needing assistance because the watch no longer turns on for some reason). So, I've spent over $400 on 2 watches and can't get any customer service. I wouldn't recommend this watch as the customer service is horrible.",
