I am not good at these kinds of electronic product, but It\u2019s easy for me to set and connect the watch with app. You can check your heart rate, blood oxygen, step count, etc., which is very helpful during working out . The design of the dial can be changed at will, many different kinds of options. It can also measure sleep quality. Highly recommended!",

While sitting talking with a friend it changed faces 3 times! It shows no historical data for heart rate or oxygen levels. Several other reviews mentioned blood pressure but if this watch has it I can't find it. I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to keep it.",

The watch can be easily connected to your phone and unlocks more features such as receiving calls, music and find my phone. It keeps an accurate step count. Another great perk is the battery life. Battery lasts about 2-3 days before having to get fully recharged. Overall very sleek and stylish design and I highly recommend purchasing as a budget friendly alternative!",

While the watch does have a mic and speaker, it doesn't have any sounds for when you set an alarm or timer or get a notification, all you get a (weak for me even at strong setting) vibration on your wrist. Not so great if you wanted to use the watch to wake up or forgot to turn the volume up on your phone. Also, while there is a nice selection of watch faces, you can only replace what is stored on the watch with one extra face at a time. You always have 8 pre-loaded faces and only 1 space to upload to. I've only been wearing the watch for one day. Everything seems to be functioning normally. Went for a walk and it tracked ok. Seems to keep a decent heart rate track as well. Bluetooth calls over the watch seem to work well and with sufficient volume as does the \"digital assistant\" function. It goes directly to my google assistant function on my phone. It would be nice if the media controls were able to read the ID3 tags from MP3s and show them on the watch as well. I'm still undecided if it will be going back just for the lack of alarm sounds.",
