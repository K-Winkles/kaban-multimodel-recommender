                "reviewText": "Prior to making this purchase I read quite a few reviews and I\u2019m ever so happy that I made this purchase. One review stated that this watch is bulky, it\u2019s a computer folks! I\u2019ve compared it to other smart watches and it is very much in line with others that cost 300 - 400 dollars. It works great making phone calls from a few favorites you add. You can answer any incoming call as long as you are no more than 10-15 feet from your phone. Works great in the car or say, while shopping and you do t want took out your phone. I have routine doctors visits and check my blood pressure reading, heart rate and oxygen levels in comparison to those done at the doctors offices. Very accurate! Weather is also very accurate and the pedometer function. Works great with my apple health and WW app. As far as it being waterproof, I\u2019m not so confident; however, it is \u201csweat proof\u201d. I does come with two watch bands, one pink and one white with more choices to purchase. I am more than pleased with this product. The only difficulty one MAY run into: getting excited and not adding it properly to the phone. The Da Fit app must be installed and the watch added to that app for it to keep current and records. When adding it to Bluetooth there are two items to add, one is FE1 and another Audio_fe1. The second is that which enables phone calls and music streamed through the watch. For me, installation and using this item has been a wonderful surprise and pleasure to use. One minor issue is once the audio is installed it will stream all audio across the watch and if you don\u2019t want that, just disconnect that one item. I love this item. From ease of installation to accuracy and wearability, I am well pleased. One other note: the battery has lasted up to a week if I don\u2019t use the audio portion to about three days if I use it making phone calls and streaming music. It is well worth it!!!",

                "reviewText": "We bought this watch for our 16 yr old daughter for christmas. She loved it and wore it every day, up until the screen stopped responding, now it is basically useless. We contacted the seller who responded very quickly and asked for an address to ship a replacement to. No fight, no questions and no fuss, they simply handled it very professionally and stood behind their guarantee. As for the watch, it does everything it says. As for the review claiming false advertising about the ad saying it's waterproof, that buyer needs to read more carefully. We had zero issues with water contact during hand washing, etc. which is exactly what the watch is rated for. Don't be an idiot and wear it in the pool or shower/bath and you won't have any problems. We are not sure what caused the screen to stop functioning, but it certainly wasn't due to water intrusion as my daughter took really good care of it. This isn't a high end fully waterproof watch rated for depth. IP67 is very standard for small electronics, and very much what the listing states, there is no false advertising from this seller. Don't hesitate to buy anything from this seller, we have had a great experience with them.",

                "reviewText": "The watch is a Nice size, wouldn\u2019t mind if it were to be Bigger either or a setting that enlarge text even more. The heartbeat are the same as my expensive brand Watch. I didn\u2019t measure on a wrist blood pressure device to know if that\u2019s accurate or not I\u2019m hoping it is. The sleep tracker data is great, I wish it were more fitness and more health related watch faces too. It charged pretty fast. It\u2019s keeping track of time of course.pairing all Bluetooth options was easy. It\u2019s convenient how you can measure HR, BP, oxygen, etc right from the app as well as the watch itself , now thats the best feature I never seen on any other watches before , good idea! ! So far I noticed a big flaw while taking from watch the mic and speaker is hitting against the wrist skin and it makes sound go in and out. A different location would have helped that problem, maybe they will design watch a bit different in the near future and maybe even adding a voice assistant like Alexa or something. This watch is a good gift for someone you like.Also, Maybe I should put both my watches on and see if the steps counter etc match up too. I\u2019m still testing everything out. Screen is clear and I recommend watch so far",

                "reviewText": "So the watch looked great when it arrived. Very large, colorful display, nifty, iPhone-esque magnetic charger, and soft rubber wrist band. After letting it charge up for a bit I checked the features and except for the watch faces being mostly goofy and substandard, everything else looked decent, and I figured I could download watch faces I liked...oh how mistaken I was.Then I scanned the QR code that took me right to the Google Play store and the V-band app, downloaded it, and began to realize the product was not what was represented. You see, a smart watch is really only as good, only as useful as the app that supports it. In the case of V-band, many, if not most of the features stated were not available. I could not select any of the presented watch faces, nor could I update my Samsung S20 Ultra to enable the app settings. I tried everything - as I'm sure many others have done, and had kind of resigned myself to just putting up with the dysfunctional app and not being able to enjoy the watch as I had expected. Then I thought, \"No, not this time. The watch might have been inexpensive, but even it it cost only a nickel, why should I accept it!\"So I jumped on Amazon to request a return authorization and send this thing back. I can tell you now, before I order the next smart watch I will first make sure to download the supporting app and see how it trials on my phone first!IF the app were functional, then maybe the watch would be great but there is no way to know if the support app is lame. READ THE REVIEWS on the app website and you will see the common theme.Do not buy any smart watch that uses the V-band app unless you've already trialed it on your phone and feel pretty sure it will work with the watch.",

Die Lieferung ging auch sehr schnell, Samstag ist ausgeschrieben gewesen und am Freitag ist sie schon da gewesen. Das Display ist sch\u00f6n gro\u00df und Bediener freundlich. Die Vibration k\u00f6nnte etwas st\u00e4rker sein oder so das man sie einstellen kann. Sch\u00f6n finde ich das man das eigene Design von seinen Bildern machen kann. Zur Akku Laufzeit kann ich noch nicht viel sagen, habe sie ja erst seit drei Tagen. Aber ich muss sagen das man hier f\u00fcr gutes Geld eine sehr gute Alternative zur Apple Watch bekommt.",
