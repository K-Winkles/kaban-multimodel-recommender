                "reviewText": "I've learned that with smart watches you always need to make a tradeoff. I like my smart watches to have fitness tracking, phone notifications, and LONG battery. Personally, battery is my main concern. I hate having to recharge a watch every day.This is the perfect smart watch I was looking for. It has enough battery so I don't have to worry about it too frequently (10 days on easy use, 6-7 for me personally as I work out with it two or three times a week and that consumes more battery).It has very good fitness tracking features, which is mostly what I was looking for. I've found the sleep tracking to be very accurate, even detecting those small midnight wake ups every now and then. Of course, since this is Zepp OS, it doesn't have too many apps and additional features to use, but that is also what helps the battery last so much.The Zepp App is a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it has a lot of useful information, and it's a lot easier to see and set up the watch from it, then having to set it in the smaller watch face. I manage and set up most of the watch settings options from the smartphone app.If you are looking to respond to Whatsapps, use Google Maps, and use more complex apps in your smartphone, then this is not for you. Look for a Samsung one, but the trade off is the battery will be considerably shorter. If you are looking for a very long battery life and absolutely only fitness tracking, then you should look into a smart band, instead of a smart watch.If you are like me, and are looking for that ideal middle point at a budget friendly price, then this is what you are looking for. This is exactly what I wanted. Very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Wear OS watch that died and wanted to replace it but that wasn't in my budget. I tried several smartwatches with my Samsung phone running Android 13 with mostly bad results; none of them did everything they claimed. Very frustrating. I wanted a circular style yet I kept looking at the BIP 5. Honestly, the only seller I found that would answer my questions honestly was Amazfit. So I gave it a chance. Glad I did.I've developed Android apps so I'm familiar with the \"inner workings\" as well as being a retired firmware engineer and one of the things that ticks me off is the fact that many Chinese watches aren't properly designed. For example, Notifications in Android are visible to all apps loaded by the OS design; Android flags them by which app generated it. Many of the watches just read some specific Notifications that they have designed their code to use and ignore others. This means, for example, if you are using Samsung Email instead of Gmail and the watch only accepts Gmail then you will never get email Notifications. This is a major problem because I couldn't find any watches that worked with everything and I found NONE that worked with a Calendar app...until this one. Based on descriptions and questions I asked, evidently to the Chinese \"Calendar\" means it will display date and time.Amazfit's Zepp app is designed to take better advantage of Android's features. In particular it seeks out all apps on your device and allows you to select whether you want Notifications from specific apps. To that purpose it uses Android's generic functions so when you look at the list you find them all. Using a different email app than Gmail? No problem. Using a messaging app different than Google Messages? No problem. Using a Calendar? No problem.I exercise often yet I usually don't wear my watch when I do because I've been known to break them. I do like using some of the fitness features yet those are usually just monitoring steps and heart rate; I have an abnormally low heart rate so I was surprised to find just how accurate the Bip 5 is for that. I can't attest to the other fitness features.I wanted a watch that could run all day without needing charging; my former Wear OS couldn't do that on busy days but most of the time it would last a single day only. The Bip 5 with heart monitoring on every few minutes has use 9% of the battery in over 24 hours so I suspect 10 days is a good estimate; I will probably charge it once a week.I wanted SMS and MMS Notifications because most \"group conversations\" are MMS; none of the watches I tried or researched would do that yet Amazfit said theirs would...and it does! Note that if you get a \"true\" MMS it notifies you that it was received but not show the video/image but I don't care about that. I just wanted to know I got a message so this works great for both SMS/MMS.I want my Calendar events on my watch...and I get them!I want to see calls coming in on my watch with the ability to reject them...and I get that!I want to get email on my watch...and I get them!I want to have a quick response to emails on my watch; Wear OS allows you to type anything but I found myself only using \"canned suggestions\" 90% of the time and usually preferred using my phone except for OK, Yes, etc. The Bip 5 allows you to reply with canned responses that you can edit...so I can do that.Supposedly I can instigate a call on the Bip 5; I haven't found that and never used that on my old watch so I probably don't care if I find that setting. For grins, I answered a call using the Bip 5 and it worked well although I wear hearing aids so I probably won't make a habit of that unless it is really quiet but it does work.Basically, the Bip 5 does the 6 things I wanted: read texts, answer texts with canned replies, read group texts, get events from my calendar, get my emails, and lasts more than a day. And it does so without drama.I honestly don't really care for the basic watch faces and didn't want to buy a custom one, especially since I wanted a round watch. To my surprise it comes with a \"photo\" watch face that you can customize with any pic you want that displays date/time over it and another optional message. I really like that so I uploaded a favorite pic. You can make multiple versions of faces, such as seasonal pics, and the app will keep them so it is easy to switch them. I only have two so far so I don't know if there is a limit to how many but it is nice to have.I read some negative comments about the Zepp app yet those were old comments. It seems well designed and easy to use. To be fair I wrote software/firmware for 35+ years, including a lot of User Interfaces so I'm better versed than most people when it comes to testing the limits of code yet honestly it looks and works pretty well. Better than a lot of other watch apps I tried.",

You can't store music on it or view maps or anything but that's to be expected at this price point. Overall a solid watch and won't be useless in 5 years because of the crazy battery life.",
