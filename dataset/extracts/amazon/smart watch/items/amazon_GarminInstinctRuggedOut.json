                "reviewText": "I purchased this watch for use in geologic field work, and it has been an excellent choice. It is light weight, has excellent battery life of over 2 weeks when paired to the phone, but not using the GPS, and even longer when you turn off phone pairing. I have not used it extensively in GPS mode for tracking courses, but I have a dedicated GPS for that. I use the GPS on the watch for the occasional location.The biggest selling point for me was the battery life, heart rate monitor, and smart watch phone pairing.My recent use case was ~3 weeks in remote Greenland at 76 North. The GPS coverage that far north was spotty on this watch, but that is not a major fault in my opinion. The watch was excellent for use in the field with the timer, alarms, and stop watch. I found I utilized the barometer a lot when planning weather related activities. The altimeter is based on the barometric pressure and was reasonably precise with elevation change, but needs to be calibrated to be accurate. I was not able to test if the altimeter could be calibrated on the GPS fix though, and I don't believe that it is. The temperature sensor is too close to skin and was effected by layers, so I did not rely on the temperature. The compass worked pretty well.The heart rate monitor worked well for me, but I don't have anything to compare it to for accuracy. I found it worked well with both tight and loose wrist band settings.The user interface was fairly straight forward to learn.I have found since getting this watch that I have been more active to see how to get better numbers. The Garmin Connect app is interesting and helpful, but my biggest announce is the app requires an internet connection in order to sync data from the watch to the app. While in remote areas without internet, I was unable to look at the trends in data I was hoping for. That is a problem with the app and not the watch, however, and I have confirmed that with Garmin.I elected to get the older version of the watch rather than the newer Instinct 2 because of the cost difference. I have been happy with it so far, and for my purposes the Instinct has fit my needs well.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this watch on a bit of a whim. Have been a big Casio G-Shock fan (like the styling) and still love them. Prior to this watch, I'd been primarily using a Casio Rangeman (not the expensive Navigation one) and Apple Watch.Things I find useful in a watch:1) Heart Rate Monitor (I'm not a serious athlete, but hey why not).2) Solid ABC (alti, baro, compass) watch. I hike in the Colorado mountains every now and then. Finding my way home can sometimes be handy.3) Can control music4) Shows my texts/notifications5) Battery Life.Again, love all my G-Shock watches. Really loved the Rangeman watch, but also liked the tech that the Apple Watch had to offer. Unfortunately, the Apple Watch lasts about a day between recharges and this ruined it for me. Sometimes I go to sleep with the watch on and have a dead watch. The regular Rangeman is great as far as battery life goes (solar), but no smart feature to speak of.Enter the Casio Rangeman Navigation watch....looks.....okay. Price....$800? WOW!!! Must do everything!!! Well it looks a bit gaudy, uses a smartphone app, and for Pete's sake....$800.While reading reviews for that watch, someone mentioned this watch. Looks good, good reviews, doesn't cost 1/2 a paycheck. Decided to order.Well, I love it. Have only had a month or so but can easily get a week's long battery life. I don't doubt the claim of 10+ days battery life, but have charged it weekly. Everything on my checklist is met:1) Heart Rate Monitor. It has one, seems to work. I'm not a superman athlete, just a regular dude.2) ABC features. Again, seems to work. The Altimeter (based on barometric pressure readings) is fairly accurate, but if you feel it's off can be set via GPS. This was a feature of that was of course missing in my regular Rangeman.3) Controls music. I mostly use this feature on vacation at the beach or at parties. Can control my phone (which is paired via Bluetooth to a speaker) via the watch. Don't have to bring my phone in the ocean and can skip songs around the campfire without messing with my phone.4) Texts come in fine. No issues. Can dismiss them via the watch, no more pulling the phone out of the pocket all the time.5) Battery life again, is great. The Apple Watch is fantastic and I love it, but it's a huge deal to have to charge the Apple Watch daily vs. this every 7-10 days.Lastly, the controls are well thought out and logical. If you can use a Casio watch, this will make sense. Just the right amount of features that this watch is not overly complex, but not too stupid either.Yeah, it's not super colorful and probably won't wow your friends, but it just works. I'm no Garmin fanboy (owned the Fenix 1, 2, and 3) which I thought were all mostly just meh, but am super impressed with this product. If your priorities in a watch are similar to mine, I think you'll be really happy with this. When the Apple Watch starts lasting a week+ between charges, I can see myself switching back to that, but until then.....",

                "reviewText": "I've always used G-Shock watches in the past so it's no surprise I like the style of this one. The Garmin Instinct is like a smart g-shock. If that appeals to you, then this is your watch.Due to the more traditional \"digital watch\" style of screen you get outstanding battery life -- up to 2 weeks without using GPS. Using GPS drains more battery so your total life will really depend how much you use that function. Speaking of the GPS, it works great. You can either use it with tracking an activity (like walking, hiking, running, biking, rowing, swimming, etc.) or simply tell it to track you. Once you're done you will get a basic map on the screen showing where you went, and if you load up the Garmin Connect app for your phone you get the detailed map and history of where you went including your speed and steps.One of the coolest GPS features is the track back, which takes you back to your starting point. It has you retrace your steps exactly rather than just pointing you in the general direction. Pretty handy if you're in the wilderness.The heart rate monitor is accurate and always keeps track of your maximum and resting heart rates, and gives you a long term history of it in the app. It's always recording this in the background, and you can also have it constantly shown on the main screen.The compass is handy and also accurate (much more than the compass in my old g-shock). The barometric pressure sensor also seems consistent. It can even warn you of potential storms due to sudden pressure changes. The temperature sensor is less useful because it is affected by your body temperature.One feature I really liked was the easy access to sunrise/sunset times and the current moon phase and rise/set times. You can even have the watch warn you if sunset is approaching.It keeps track of your steps and floors climbed at all times and dynamically updates your daily goal based on your activity.In terms of smart features, they are very basic but they get the job done with no extra fluff. Once paired with your phone, you can show notifications on the watch (it can also vibrate). You can ignore notifications from certain apps if you want, or turn them off entirely. The Garmin Connect app is easy to use and your watch stays synced without you having to open the app. I've had no bluetooth issues. You can also have the current weather and forecast on the watch.Another smart feature I appreciated was how Garmin Connect can interface with MyFitnessPal which is the app I use to track calories and my weight. It can automatically add your steps and calories burned to the MyFitnessPal app, and other things like your current weight will be transferred back to the Garmin app. My only complaint there is it seems Garmin is a bit too generous with the extra calories (even if your activity level in the MyFitnessPal app is set to sedentary).There was 6 different watch faces, with dark and light versions for each. I preferred the default one. You can completely customize the watch face and choose what you want to display on it. Date, heart rate, steps, sunrise/sunset, battery level, barometric pressure, etc. I am impressed how much useful data you can get displayed on one screen at a glance. The backlight has adjustable brightness and you can also set it to automatically turn on when you raise your wrist.The band is comfortable and fits any size wrist, even very large ones. Overall I am thrilled with this watch and wish I got one years ago when they first launched. This is the smart/fitness watch for someone who doesn't want a smart watch.",

I am using this Garmin for one month now and I am very amazed by the quality products.It has all the cool stuff I used to like with Apple Watch and which are really useful:- watsapp messages, all notifications mirrored from an iPhone- call and ID notification, though you cannot speak through the watch (which honestly I hardly never used)- music control from the watch (any app, Spotify, Deezer, music app) so you can change a song and control the volume in a shower or from your sofaIn addition it is better:- battery life, this is really great not to charge it for 8 to 10 days in my experience and usage, especially if you travel for 2 / 3 days, no need to bother for a charger,- stronger, no worries if any shock while doing outside activities,- time is always on display (no need to lift the harm),- water and shockproof, can go deep and in the sea,- strong / rugged design- internal sensors (temperature, altimeter).Of course it has no coloured / touch screen, so you have to do everything with the buttons but honestly it is less fragile / sensitive and i prefer it like this. It sometimes loses Bluetooth connection, but I restart it and it is fine. It restart very fast anyways (20s).",
