                "reviewText": "I love this watch, it's just as hardcore as my drill sergeant in Parris Island, gunnery Sergeant Thompson, accidentally I've smacked the face of this watch against metal concrete because sometimes you get into tight situations and the face of the watch will definitely smack against something metal glass concrete etc, and this watch will literally take a beating I've seen the promotional videos where they're trying to drill through it they hit it with a hammer whatever type of glass they're using it's probably more like quartz, because the name on the front of the watch describes everything a complete tank, this watch is definitely nuclear bomb proof, as far as charging capability with the wireless charger pretty cool, definitely hassle free and quick charge, even at like 5% this box will charge to 100 in less than an hour, functions extremely well the only thing that doesn't work really well is monitoring my sleep behavior, for some reason it seems like if I sleep 8 hours I'm only getting 10 to 30 minutes of actual REM sleep deep sleep, but how can the watch distinguish REM sleep from regular sleep according to your blood pressure or your pulse rate every individual is different so how can you possibly measure that for one person to the next because someone could have a higher pulse rate yet they're in a REM sleep, but as far as the other functions 100%, the heart rate monitor blood oxygen levels everything is on point, as far as thinking it to your phone and getting all your notifications and messages there is no type of sound effect when somebody basically messages you or alerts you the only thing you really have is a vibration which you could turn off in order to make the battery last longer, besides being one of the most hardcore smart watches on the market or the best possible price, definitely has a lot of features and functions that I enjoy like using my own personal pictures as the wallpaper for this watch, also the fact that there's no need to bring this watch to a jeweler or order another battery and take off the bottom panel to swap out batteries a few years later because it's rechargeable,I read some reviews for people say they get a week or two with a single battery charge but it's probably because they have all their notifications enabled for every single application they have the vibrate feature on and they also probably have the brightness as high as it'll go and that will drain your battery down within like a week or two, I'm going for performance, and longevity, so my screen is tinted down pretty much all the way to where you can almost not see it especially outside in the bright sunlight, but as far as how long it'll really last if you have the brightness and everything adjusted to get maximum power efficiency, I would say probably more than 3 weeks some people say they got over two weeks without a single charge but I'm at almost 3 weeks and still at 54% battery power, so I think the maximum amount of power and longevity you're going to get before you have to charge this is probably a month 30 days, which is actually really good because who wants the charger smartwatch like their cell phone everyday or every other day, and between having a really good battery lots of features and if you take a look at the custom military green digital analog that I set up for this watch you can take a selfie of your own face and put it on your watch if you wanted to, or you can put a picture of your beautiful wife or some of your beautiful kids of your family, features are definitely decent 9 out of 10, power and longevity excellent 10 out of 10, and my most favorite feature how hardcore this watch is, seriously if you ever get mad and lose your temper and have a conniption fit instead of throwing your phone throw your watch because this will not break you can probably run it over with your car in the parking lot and the watch will still work it might be slightly bent or disfigured or scratched but it's still going to function and work properly, I've never literally seen a smartwatch that was nuke proof, so if you're the type of person that's extremely hardcore with your technology because of your work or you're just a heavy handed person and you slam your electronics around because you just live a rough and rugged lifestyle and you're always on the go this is definitely a watch that's indestructible, I know a lot of you construction workers and Mason workers and carpentry workers are extremely hard on your gear especially your watches, so you're looking for a watch that can basically stand up till your daily activities, this is the one the tank.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this watch for about two weeks now, I'm a construction worker and a fitness fanatic. This has been an excellent smartwatch for the money. It does have some bugs but they're pretty easy to work around until it gets updated.What you're getting: the battery is amazing and charges quickly (I just throw it on the charger while I'm in the shower), the touch screen works very well (except I'd turn off the auto screen-on feature if you're going into water) and it's quite durable. The smart sport tracking works pretty well, blood oxygen and pressure work excellently (although I'd like to know how the blood pressure works), the heart rate monitor works pretty well. It's nice to be able to check texts without pulling my phone out of my pocket. I love that I can change the background, there are so many to choose from and all varied read outs, it's not just color palette swap, and they really utilize the odd screen shape. Even the included app is simple and well put together. If you work a lot of dead tree carcass like I do, you will have to occasionally take the watch off to clear the back lasers of sweat infused cellulose to restore health monitor function but that's not a flaw of the watch.What you're not getting: this is not a Garmin, there's no ABC, no gps, no tap pay or independent wifi communication. Although abc would be a nice addition, I'm fine without the rest. No solar recharge, although with the battery you don't need it. You're also not getting a watch that plays games, you can't text (you can read recent texts though) no James bond voice chat from it, and you can't take pictures or video call (although the is a handy remote control to use your phone camera).The bugs: I only include this in hopes that they fix it. First and most glaring bug is that often times when you scroll down to read old texts or additional information after a workout the watch will crash. On the positive, the phone is back online in 20 seconds or less and only takes a little more time to catch up heart rate.Second bug is a minor inconvenience, watch doesn't seem to communicate with phone specifically on sleep monitor. Everything else is good though, so it's kind of odd.The last one, I don't know if this is a bug or just an inconvenience to me, sometimes the heat rate monitor isn't the most accurate and I have to move the watch around to find a sweet spot. I can't say of this is normal for smart watches or not.",

                "reviewText": "This watch is great for the price, I have owned it since October 2022. Sleep tracking: 4 stars cause sometimes it says I sleep longer than I actually did. Also wish it tracked sleep during the day cause I am a 3rd shifter who sleeps during the dayDurability: 4.5 stars straps did break and tear as shown in pic after taking on and offHeart rate, BP, and O2: 5 stars it works great, but remember not as accurate as hospital instrumentsText message reading: 4 stars can read them, but not respondPhone call/audio: 5 stars work great and can hear well and adjust volumeWeather: 5 stars connects to phoneSteps: 3 stars not very accurate if you swing you arms to walkOverall I love the watch, you can put your own pic on the main screen, Weather works great, very comfortable. Downside wish it tracked sleep during the day or could set it to when you sleep for us 3rd shifters. Customer service was great after watch bands broke contacted them and they are sending replacement band. They responded in 1 day. I had a different brand smart watch andtyz and it lasted 90 days and said you could swim with it and it lied cause it died. This watch I have stuck in water to fix sump pump, washed in cold water everyday to get work crap off of it, and washed hands and it still works. Just don't take hot shower with it on or go in sauna with it. Also, battery has lasted me a week or more when you dont use the look feature to turn it on. Definitely recommend this watch",
