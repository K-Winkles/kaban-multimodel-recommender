While there is a music panel, the absence of confirmation on Spotify connectivity leaves some uncertainty.Music PanelThe inclusion of a music panel on the Faweio Watch is a welcome feature for music enthusiasts. While it's unclear whether it directly integrates with Spotify, the ability to control music playback adds value for those who enjoy tunes during workouts or daily activities. The interface is intuitive, allowing for easy navigation through playlists and volume control.Overall ImpressionIn conclusion, the Faweio Watch is a commendable fitness tracker with a host of features that cater to a wide range of health and wellness needs.

I use a lot more of the features than I did the halo. I believe it has more features than halo. The one thing I use everyday (besides exercise options) is the sleep tracker! It shows deep and light sleep but according to the watch I never REM with that's not accurate at all. So that's one star off of my rating. That's kinda something I really wanted!I like the app it's attached to.It's attractive and helpful and reasonably priced! I would recommend and I would probably buy again (depending on how long it lasts)***EDIT: (3 months)Junk! Woke up and overnight all the options for exercising is \"outdoor running\" I don't even use that option! Went to settings both on the app (nothing helped)Setting on the watch only\"Watch face\" and \"Display\" the rest of the options are blank and not clickable!",

I got a replacement from the seller, and this one is much better already. It just arrived today, the 30th of December 2023, but it\u2019s connected without issue. Took about 30 seconds. It runs smoothly, and so far seems to have all the features it claims.I\u2019ll update in a few days to a week with anything new.Edit: Here\u2019s the update. I had received a new phone as a graduation + Christmas present, and it was an android. The following feature review is from the perspective of being connected to an android phone. Although I did get it connected to my iPhone.It can receive notifications, but not text messages, if sent from an iPhone. It also cannot reply to messages. It does a decent job of tracking heart rate, and it seems to have a sleep tracking feature, but I don\u2019t need to be informed of how bad my sleep is, so I don\u2019t use that one. It does track my steps. Which, to be honest, is the reason I bought it in the first place. If you\u2019re getting it out of medical necessity, getting a watch that matches your phone brand, or an actual fit bit would be in your best interest. Otherwise, this is a great cheap option.",

I was able to sync 10 of my contacts from my iPhone to the watch. The watch notifies you of texts and messages. The phone also allows you to receive calls from your 10 programmed contacts. It is easy to program. If I can do it, anyone can. It has a lot of features such as recording sleep, activity, heart rate, oxygen level, weather, and Alexa. The battery stays charged for a number of days and is easy to charge. I would not hesitate to recommend this watch for others to buy.",
