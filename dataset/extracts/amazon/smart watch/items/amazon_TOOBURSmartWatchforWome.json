Is the watch compatible with iPhone and Android phones? How to pair the watch with my phone? 1. Yes, the watch is compatible with ios 9.0+ and android 6.0+ 2. Turn on the Bluetooth on your phone -->Download \"Veryfit\" from App Store -->Scan the QR code on the watch screen -->Follow the instruction.

If the screen remains black for more than 3 seconds, you need to press the button to wake up the screen. Why the watch's data tracking is not accurate 1. During initial setup, ensure the watch time is correct, and provide accurate gender, age, height, and weight information in \"VeryFit\". 2. Stabilize the watch and minimize unnecessary movement (left, right, up, or down) during physical activities. How do I get Alexa to Work? Can I use Alexa to make calls? 1. Connect the watch to your phone --> Open \"Veryfit\" App and go to \"Device\" --> Click \"Alexa\" and login to your account. 2. No, the watch doesn't support calling with Alexa.

As well as read messages instantly, set alarms monitor your steps, and so much more! Also battery life is great! And it came fully charged! And the mobile app is so easy to use! Very easy set up and connection to the watch!",

It pairs wit the fit cloud pro app. There are so many watch faces to chose from or you can use your own photo. It keeps track of my steps, kcal and miles walked. It measures my heart rate and even monitors my sleep pattern. I connect to my phone with Bluetooth so I am able to receive and answer calls as well as texts. (Note:because it is connected with Bluetooth, your phone must be nearby) it is convenient while I\u2019m out because I can see calls and messages without pulling my phone out of my purse.It is not an Apple Watch so the features are limited, but it\u2019s perfect for what I need. The price is also alot less.I recommend this watch for health monitoring. It\u2019s easy to use. Perfect for me!",

When I do this, the readings work better. Watch gets 4 stars. That's as high as I'll go.***UPDATE***Well, I guess all good things come to an end, as they say. Downgrading my rating from 5 to 3 stars. After using watch for a while, the heart rate monitor is very spotty. It doesn't work consistently. When I have the watch secured correctly, I'm still getting a reading error; it's pretty ridiculous. Maybe the developer can fix in a future firmware update? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fUntil then, they loose 2 stars.***Original Review****A gorgeous watch. I've purchased many smartwatches, from dirt cheap to hundreds of dollars, and this a very well-made watch. For the price, you'd think it'd be low quality, but no. One thing I really like is the strap. It connects underneath instead of over top. With my last watch, the strap would constantly come loose, particularly during sleep (I'm an adventurous sleeper) but this strap seems sturdy and stays in place, well, so far. Nice job. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffdI also like how the heart/stress monitoring feature is presented. Easy to know how long you need to stay still. My former watch didn't have a timer, so just had to wait an indeterminate amount of time until the watch did its thing.The screen is nice size too and there are a good number of watch faces. Screen resolution is pretty clean and sharp, again, I purchased this watch for $30, so I'm quite impressed. We've come a long way in this \"lower-priced\" smartwatch game! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdI'll see how the sleep monitoring goes, as it'll be my 1st time using that feature. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffdI'll update review periodically as I use the watch. \ud83d\ude09",

The look is sleek and nice2. The charge lasts for DAYS. Literally like 3-5 days and when you charge, it takes less than 2 hours.3. Notifications from texts, calls, alarms, and misc other things.4. Counts steps, calories, miles walked5. Can do heart rate, sleep tracking\u2014 best of all though, I lost it couldn\u2019t find it and my son found it in our hot tub. When I turned it on, it literally worked perfectly after 18+ hours in our hot tub \ud83e\udd23 I mean?!! Who\u2019s making these things. Best $30 technology I\u2019ve paid for.Drawbacks: no picture viewing, Alexa and oxygen saturation doesn\u2019t seem to work on my watch.",

                "reviewText": "I am impressed with many things about this watch but it only notifies me of phone calls but not text messages. Am I doing something wrong or does this not work? I\u2019ve poured over every setting possible, I get only phone call notifications.Additionally, it does not partner with MyFitnessPal app, therefore all the steps counting does not get synced up and measure with the app so that I can track my true calories. It syncs with the Apple Health app and I have the Health app and MyFitnessPal set up with permissions to see eachother but adding the VeryFit app added a layer that confuses both the apps, so I\u2019m not happy that MyFitnessPal has no exercise data like I would get from Fitbit.Finally, the watch lights up at night when I\u2019m moving in my sleep. It\u2019s so bright it wakes me! I set the do not disturb for a certain time but there\u2019s nothing for the watch screen.I\u2019m impressed this can make phone calls. My husband was floored that the sound quality is so good when I\u2019m talking through my watch. So if you\u2019re looking for that, and a great watch face, plus steps and other health monitoring, and you don\u2019t need it to sync to MyFitnessPal, then this is a really good watch. I recommend also buy black screen film to put it on at night, or take it off but you won\u2019t get sleep tracking.",

Replacing my 2 year old Fitbit which wasn't holding much of a charge, only charging to about 86%, so needing to be charged again 24 hours later. Fitbits are expensive to replace so I took a chance and opted for this one. Not so impressed with the notifications, they are very brief, as I often hear or feel the vibration of a message coming though but have no idea what it was often as it only lasts for a couple of seconds before disappearing, not sure where to find them after they vanish. I also have mixed feelings about the magnetic charging cable, great that it can only link up and attach in one, correct direction to charge, it attaches quickly and easily to the watch, which is great, but it can also detach very easily too if accidentally disturbed or bumped stopping charging of not noticed. A full charge lasts most of the week too. I'm still happy with my purchase, great watch for the price.",
