                "reviewText": "I needed a watch to count my steps/heart rate and use at work for controlling audio plus checking time. I like the price and options on this one so gave it a try. So far a couple of days in and I'm really happy with this smart watch. The look is simple and the feel of the watch on my wrist is good so far. Also, the wrist band seems easy to change to a new one if needed. Step count is working and has so many features that I am just getting used to. The app is very easy to use and allows me to change the phone face to anything basically. The heart rate monitor is pretty acurate as I took my heart rate in a minute and watch was only off a heart beat so I'm happy with that. I have use this on my long walks to keep a check on my heart rate and step count. The features are many and have not used them all as I'm still getting used to the watch. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and for the price, it's an awesome deal. I will update once I have use this watch for a longer period. I would recommend this smart watch.",
