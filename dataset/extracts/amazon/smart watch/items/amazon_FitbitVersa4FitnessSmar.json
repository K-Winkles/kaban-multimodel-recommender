                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Make sure you have the latest version of the fitbit app",
                "reviewText": "When I first got this, it would not maintain sync. I updated the firmware on the watch, tried doing a factory reset twice, uninstalled/reinstalled the fitbit app twice, ensured that the app wasn't allowed to go to sleep when in the background... nothing worked. It would work for a few minutes, then when I tried to command Alexa, it would say connection lost. I decided to contact support, and they informed me that my app was outdated. Come to find out, version 4.04 of the bitbit app is too old, and will not work. The latest version, 4.06.7 had not been released for my phone yet, as is typical ridiculous play store behavior. Google... are you listening? When a developer releases an update, you shall IMMEDIATELY make it available to EVERY device! I manually downloaded the apk and installed it, and everything has been working great since. Alexa follows my direct orders immediately, phone calls come through, texts come through, and I can sync with ease.Overall, I suppose this is an improvement over the Versa 2. Screen is a little bigger, but the notification vibrations don't seem to be as forceful, even when set to strong.This uses google wallet instead of google pay as the Versa 2 did, so my AmEx will not work for contactless payment.Phone call feature is nice, seems to work OK. I can hear them, they can hear me. You can only answer calls, you can't make them. The $50 brand x watch I ordered to replace this one before I got the sync figured out was able to do that. It could also control my camera and music player, neither of which is possible on the Versa 4.Google maps is nice if you walk in unfamiliar areas. I'll probably never need it, but it's nice.Battery life seems to be improved over the Versa 2, but mine was 2 years old so I'm sure the battery had gradually decreased it's charge capacity. I used it for several days, and he battery was still at 55%.Skin temperature sensor will one day be nice when it can sync with a smart thermostat and automatically adjust the temperature as needed. But for now, it's just a novelty and has no purpose. Yes, I know my skin is hot. I woke up in a puddle of sweat. Yup, I'm freezing, so my skin is cold.o2 saturation is nice if you have any relevant health problems.If you want to take full advantage of the watch, get the free \"Overview\" clock face by Chris Blyth. It gives you current and average heart rate, battery percentage, fully customizable date format, allows for a larger clock that shows seconds, and you can have weather, and 6 other health stats displayed on the main screen, all at once. I have steps, distance, calories burned, active zone minutes, floors, and BMI/BMR. It all fits, and is easy to read. Vast improvement over the default face, which shows no useful information. I had th is face on my versa 2, and loved it. So glad it's available for the 4.Bottom line, it's a good watch. There are cheaper brand x ones out there, but none of them have NFC payment, and not all of them have Alexa. And, you get what you pay for. fit & finish feels cheap, the screens get washed out in the sun, finicky alexa integration and so on. Best to pony up and get a refined product. Be sure to update your fitbit app. Their customer support said the latest version should be released within a week, but I circumvented the beurocracy and downloaded it manually. Why wait?",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Fitbit. My first was the slimline tracker. My big complaint was that I couldn't read it when outdoors where I do most of my activities. Grr! Now I can see my stats while I am outside!The Fitbit APP changed before I changed devices and it does not perform as well as the other one (why was it changed?). Mainly it is incredibly slow at catching up to the data. I have to go to the day before and return to today to get it to spin to the correct numbers. Sometimes yesterday isn't even current! What's with that??The battery life is less than the tracker, but that was expected from the info I read before buying. There is always a text to alert that the battery is low so there is not a risk of losing data. Also, it charges very fast.",

                "reviewText": "The Versa 4 is a very well designed fitness and health tracker. The watch is incredibly light weight, the band is very comfortable ( I can wear it all day long and not really notice it). The screen is incredibly bright (I turn brightness down to minimum) with deep blacks and very strong colors. The battery life is fantastic typically lasting a week and it charges very quickly (usually 30-40 minutes for a full charge) Heart metrics are excellent, I wore both my Apple Watch SE and the Versa 4 side by side on different arms for several days. The calculated heart rates for both devices including resting and HRV was the same. The sleep tracking is wonderful, very accurate measurements for duration and the scoring is a nice motivating tool and insight into your health. The app is quite a bit for the bang, you get heart, fitness, food, water, weight, calorie, sleep and mental health tracking. Overall a fantastic device, well designed, with excellent health and fitness capabilities.",

If you are like me and a careful shopper, do you by another Fitbit or listen to the media? I read 100+ reviews and decided on the Versa 4. Is it perfect and have every option? No, but either does the Apple Watch. It has been very reliable even after almost a year and you can tune the battery usage easily. I like the Google interface and the iOS interface. I believe it has better health and workout stats/metrics than Apple. Suggestion: buy a silicone cover. No watch is indestructible and is worth the money. Have fun!",
