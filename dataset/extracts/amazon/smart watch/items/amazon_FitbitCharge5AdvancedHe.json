                "reviewText": "Charge 5 is working great ever since I turned off the GPS. Battery lasts at least 8-9 days. Everything else is working great.2/14/2022Amazon replaced the Charge 5. 10/26/2021.I am hoping all is well now. I still love the features and product. However, Fitbit Customer support is atrocious unlike the amazing customer service from Amazon. .11/01/2021 Update.The new tracker still can't track distance accurately. I am not sure if it is due to the forested mountain trail or my jacket & gloves covering the tracker or a combination. The distance is off by 2 miles reporting 6+ to 7+ miles on a four mile trail. Otherwise it seems to be fine. I might as well just accept things as they are. But if you are a hiker and want to get accurate information about your hike, better hike in open dessert in the summer. Disappointed!*********I am very; active hiking and resistance training. (Weights). The old trackers did fairly well counting my steps during my hikes. But were close to worthless when it came to my weight training or even doing abdominal's. The charge 5 tracks everything.The screen is so easy to read. Very simple to navigate through all the modes. I am very pleased with it. But only had it a few days, so time will tell.2 weeks later....I still love the features but the device is full of glitches. I assume software glitches.I hike the exact same trail up the mountain and back three times a week. Each hike the Charge 5 is reporting different mileage. The difference is significant over 0ne mile and sometimes two miles off.It has gone dead apparently or else I died for one hour twice at the time I went to sleep, one hour later it starts to register a heartbeat and record my sleep.I have called Fitbit twice, got the old we will get back with you via email with instructions. No email.I would recommend waiting till they get the bugs out of the software before buying a Charge 5. No I am not going to send mine back, my old Charge 3 died a few days before I bought the Charge 5. So I will bite the bullet and hope they remedy the issues soon.October 24th .....It died or I did again for 35 minutes last night when I went to sleep. Called Fitbit was given the run around. Finally I was told again that they would contact me via email with instructions.I am sure that they know they have a problem but don't want to admit it. Probably working on a fix. So stalling for time. It is also tracking my hikes inconsistently reporting varying distances even though I am always hiking the exact same mountain trail and have been doing it now for 14 years consistently.",

                "reviewText": "I would recommend you sort reviews by most recent. I have noticed that since Google took them over, the reviews have gotten really bad.My Fitbit and a brick are now the same. Bricked four months after warranty. Customer Service told me they can't help me and tried to sell me a new Fitbit instead, with a discount. Never again.Fitbit has been a comedy of problems. I really liked the app, except the heart rate history during an exercise never worked. It always said, \"not enough data\" but I considered that a minor flaw. The heart rate monitor itself worked fine, it was only when reporting during exercise it couldn't map the history. I also had to swipe the app most of the time to get Fitbit to update on my screen. It rarely did it by itself. Also a small problem.When they recently updated the software, a bigger problem was sleep recording. It only worked intermittently, all of a sudden, when it was working fine prior to the update. I even cleaned the contacts as they instruct to clean them, and switched hands, and increased sensitivity, didn't make a difference. This was a bigger problem for me as I used that quite a bit.Then, one day, I went to put it on the charger and it wouldn't charge. I cleaned the contacts again, no difference. After a day or so, the FitBit died. I tried different charging blocks, different outlets, no difference. My wife had a new Fitbit charger she never used, so I tried that, no good. Bricked.But the real pain was when I called Customer Service and they didn't care. Only four months after warranty and they had no interest in helping me even though I was paying EIGHTY DOLLARS a year for their premium service. How does that work? The device is $125 and they are charging me $80 a year for the service - so they would rather lose $80 a year multiplied by \"x\" years than spend the $20 it probably costs them to replace my FitBit.And then they want to sell me a replacement. What?! I just spent $125 on a device that barely lasted a year and their solution is to buy another device that might only last a year with a little discount? Oh, and keep paying the $80 annual membership. Um. No. Tossed the Fitbit in the trash. Put a regular watch back on. Saved $100, and $80 and I'm sleeping better too. Guess it wasn't helping after all. Just as well, I don't need Google knowing all my health history anyway.",
