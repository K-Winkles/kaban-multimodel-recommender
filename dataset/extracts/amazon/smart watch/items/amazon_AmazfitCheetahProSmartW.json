Just after a couple weeks I went back to the gtr4 so I can go outside and not take earphones",

                "reviewText": "So here's my best review I can give from having only had the watch for 5 days. Battery- charged it up to 96% when it first arrived, haven't charged it since and it's at 45% on the beginning of the 5th day. I've used alot for walking, adding apps and watch faces, and checking blood pressure, etc. So I feel like I've given it a good push for resource use. Looks like it might hold some type of charge for maybe 10 days before recharge is needed.Usage - the app \"Zepp\" is not very intuitive so I have to click around a bit to find what I want. Othere than that it's fairly a good application for what I need. I wish you could type sms replies from the watch but you can only use \"quick replies\" which is still ok. (I like typing from my phone anyway lol) Phone answers and can call from the watch via Bluetooth so that's a +Only thing I've found to NOT work is Alexa. Simply won't connect from Zepp and it just spins and spins.I came from a Galaxy watch 46mm, and this so far blows that out of the water in my opinion due to the battery life.Update: 1/24 After 7 days of heavy use I've not had to charge it and I have 25% battery left!!!! I'm going to push it to see how long it will last! The battery life for this watch is AMAZING!!!!",
