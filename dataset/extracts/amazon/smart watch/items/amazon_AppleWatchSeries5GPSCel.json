Still really good for the price. If you don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles but still want good features. This is the watch for you. Highly recommend edit: I recently got another Apple Watch a series 7. First the battery life is so much better, get the series 7 renewed for only like $50-100 more. But still the series 5 is still a decent watch even now",

                "reviewText": "While reading the comments and further reviews, I was still skeptical of buying it with this page. Finally, made up my mind and bought it, so here\u2019s my honest opinion of what I received so far:Physically, the Watch looks as new for being refurbished, though it does show signs that was used before. I think that a further polishing and cleaning to the product would affect it before shipping it. The borders, Digital Crown, screen and speakers are totally functional and work perfectly. When charging it, I was initially scared as the first symbol of the charger appeared. Thought the battery was dead or the charger was not the proper one. After some time, it worked. Battery percentage was my biggest disappointment. I bought the product \u201cReacconditioned as new\u201d, but changing the battery to 100% wouldn\u2019t hurt to really sell something with great price and performance. For the rest, it\u2019s a matter of time to see how the Watch works through daily basis. I\u2019ll keep you posted. If you ask for my opinion, buying the product here is a great option if you\u2019re short in budget, but if you find a better one, go ahead.",
