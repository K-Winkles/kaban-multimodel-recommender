                "reviewText": "I had a Samsung watch for almost 2 years, paid $10 a month for the ability to get and receive calls and had to charge it at least once a day sometimes more because of the battery. When the battery finally died, (I could sit and watch the percentage go down), I ordered this watch. I didn't expect much since it was so much less expensive than the Samsung. I was pleasantly surprised when it came, the looks and options were really good. Then I found out I could still make or get phone calls on the watch which was again incredible, without paying $10 a month for the benefit. And then the battery. After the first charge it lasted six full days. Since then it hasn't been quite that good but it's at least 4 days. After coming from a watch that had to be charged twice a day in order to get through the night I am thrilled. Definitely worth a purchase.",

Si vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez un bracelet en silicone, un autre bracelet noir est fourni dans la bo\u00eete. J'adore son grand \u00e9cran avec ses couleurs tr\u00e8s lumineuses. Son fonctionnement est tr\u00e8s intuitif et il n'y a pas besoin de lire la notice pour savoir s'en servir rapidement. Il y a un tr\u00e8s grand nombres de choix de cadrans ce qui permet de le changer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Elle est tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te au niveau de ses fonctionnalit\u00e9s, il y en a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment ( sport, fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, sommeil, prise d'appel, consultation des messages... etc) Tout y est pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins qu'une montre connect\u00e9e doit avoir.",
