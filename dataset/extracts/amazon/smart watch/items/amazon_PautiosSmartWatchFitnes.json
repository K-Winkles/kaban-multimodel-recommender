                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Watch for the Price",
                "reviewText": "I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because of the following.Pautios customer service (support@ipautios.com) responded in under an hour when I reached out to them. They recommended a reboot to solve issues I had with the watch.The watch became much more accurate when I gave the Fitdock app location settings ALL the time, then rebooted the watch through the app. The mileage during workouts became more accurate and my bike rides now come up with a map of where I rode. I also started to get alerts when my heart rate goes into the red zone while biking. My sleep times also became more accurate with the reboot.I recommend you turn on GPS access (locations settings) at ALL times. Make any personal setting changes you like. Then reboot the phone through the app to activate all of those changes. To reboot the watch through the app go to \"Settings\"--> \"Device\" then \"Restart the device \". It will ask you to confirm the device's restart and sync data prior to the reboot.Original ReviewI received my Pautios Smart Watch three days ago. The first thing I noticed was how comfortable it felt. Almost like it wasn\u2019t there at all. Prior to buying the watch I checked the app that it syncs with to make sure it was well rated. The Fitdock app is currently rated 4.3 stars at the Google Play Store, much better than apps other smart watches link to. The watch was pretty straight forward to set up and figure out.I have run three different work out tests on it. Keep in mind that some of my issues are with the watch and others with the Fitdock app the watch links to.I initially thought the step count was off, but after going for a 2.44 mile walk I believe the step count of 5,038 indicates the step count is fairly accurate. However, the miles it recorded were off. The 2.44 miles was based on my Samsung Health App and also my bike speedometer over the same route. This watch showed only 1.9 miles for the route. I like that the watch buzzed me when my BPM hit the red zone. I am not sure what to think about the KCAL that the watch showed. It showed 216 KCAL for the walk while the Samsung Health App showed 173 KCAL.I went for an 11.85 mile bike ride. This mode was somewhat disappointing. When I turned it on it asked me to be sure my Bluetooth was connected for GPS from my phone, which I did. However, at the end of the ride it only showed a distance of 0.13 miles. The watch does not show the miles during the ride or in the training record. I was also disappointed that the watch didn\u2019t buzz me when my BPM went into the red zone. The KCAL was reversed for the bike ride compared with the walk. The Samsung Health App showing more KCAL this time, 427 KCAL, and the watch showed less at 276 KCAL.I used the watch when I golfed also. There is no golf mode, so I selected the Other mode. This mode only monitors the Heart Rate, KCAL and length of time. It would be nice if the number of training modes were increased to include other activities like golfing.During all exercise modes I was not able to see, or access the watch face, but the exercise mode did show the time of day.The notification feature only makes it possible to read notifications on the watch. You can not respond to notifications. I was disappointed to find that setting a sleep time did not silence the notifications. They still buzzed on my arm when they came through, so I turned the feature off.Battery Life seems good. I\u2019m a few hours short of 3 days since the phone was charged and the battery is at 75%.As for the watch band. While it was super comfortable initially, I have found when moisture (sweat or water) get between it and the skin it can become uncomfortable. I have also found that the piece that holds the tail of the strap in place can irritate my wrist. I would like to be able to get some watch bands to interchange, but I have not been able to find any. I would also like to find some bands like the Apple watch has that do not have a buckle at all.I played around a bit with the watch faces. I found it a bit challenging to add my own photos. For some reason they didn\u2019t want to upload. I eventually was able to load a photo.While I have found a few things that don\u2019t like, all in all, for the money this smart watch is a very good value and the quality is as good or better than expected.",

                "reviewText": "This is a definite \"where have you been, all my life?\" Watch!I LOVE the convenience of a timer, Alexa voice controls i.e. reminders, add to shopping list - quickly available wherever I am!Battery life is excellentFace choices vast and clean, filling face accurately, not truncated and hard to view. You can select just a watch, favorite read outs such as steps/date, 3 activities or even a holiday background.Actually a sensor to help you choose an exercise activity i.e. indoor/outdoor walking.The button on the side is not decorative - it allows you to change windows, giving you new options. With the touch screen you can scroll through options.Honestly, I will purchase a back up watch because I don't think my day would be happy without one!FYI for charging, if you are not sure which direction to line up the charger, no worries, it repels if it is the wrong way!The App - very colorful. Appears to have accurate sleep, walk and other monito records. Does have ads on initial open.This, in my opinion is the BEST fitness watch I have ever owned and trust me, I have owned many!Thank you",

                "reviewText": "I got diagnosed with POTS recently, so I wanted a watch that would be compatible with my phone (iPhone 11), but also had all the functionality that I needed.Personally, for the price, this is amazing. It occasionally kicks off the app, and needs to be worn super tight, but the EKG features, weather reports, phone notifications/calls, sleep monitoring, etc is worth it.I wish it didn\u2019t need to be so tight, sometimes it\u2019ll tell me it needs to be tighter (whilst cutting off circulation), but you really can\u2019t beat the price.The screen works well, has some cool features, mostly stays connected, and has done well for my job in healthcare.I dinged it one star for how tight it needs to be on my wrist, and the occasional connectivity issues.Overall, worth it.",

It's a great piece for very little money and the battery life is better than my phone! Try it!",

I needed a replacement smart watch quickly and did not want to spend a lot of money as I am in the pool 5 hours a week and that seems to affect how long watches last before the led display starts to disapear. I've used the watch two weeks now. I was disappointed that there was only a lap counter and not any for aeorbics although there is one for freestyle exercise. I'm not sure of the accuracy of steps and calories burned as this watch is showing much less than my old one and the sleep tracker thinks I'm sleeping when watching TV. The data that is displayed on your phone is not very detailed either. I do like that you can setup reminders to drink or move and can read text messages. Battery life is good. Overall it is ok for the price.",
