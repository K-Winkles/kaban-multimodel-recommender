                "reviewText": "Here are the pros and cons of this smartwatch:----Pros:+ Battery life lasted very long, I charged it fully 100% on 06/26/2021, and on 07/09/2021, the battery was at 15%, which was about 3 weeks, I connected it with Bluetooth for less than 1 hour each day. The battery is awesome!+ So many cute backgrounds to choose from. I can also use my own picture as my watch face and design it. As shown in my photos.+ So many functions: stopwatch, blood pressure, heart rate, step counting automatically, Oxygen rate, alarm, flashlight, weather, ...+ Notifications from Instagram, texts,...+ Sport mode, training mode,...+ Waterproof+ Screen is big+ There is a screen protector already applied+ Screentouch is sensitive, works very well+ Sleep tracking+ The flashlight is very bright-----Cons:+ Cannot reply to messages or notifications+ Cannot make a phone call+ Cannot take a picture via the watch (unless I connect it to the phone and use the watch to capture a photo via the phone)+ No web browser+ No recording+ No maps+ No GPS+ Only updates the weather while connecting to the phone Bluetooth+ No direct music played by the watch+ No Gmail, cannot compose any emails/messages---------***---------I love this smartwatch because it has all the features I need, I don't want to spend a few hundred dollars on a smartwatch that I have to charge every single day, so this is the best option for me. I love that this watch allows me to count down the minutes or the seconds. I also love the breathing app on the watch. I usually disconnect it to Bluetooth because I don't want to receive many notifications which are distracting.Highly recommended! This is one of the best products I've found on Amazon.-------Let me know if my photos are helpful!",

It can the next day which was great. I love the color and I love the functionality of it. It's inexpensive as well but it's definitely a great watch. I love that you can change the watch faces and it has so much it can do. It's perfect for what I use it for. I would definitely recommend this watch for anyone. One thing I also like is that the bands are replaceable, you can unclip easily and use a new set of you wanted to. This is easily my favorite new watch, for the price and the functionally it's really great.",

I guess in the end, you order something cheap, you receive what you pay for.

It measures your steps, sleep, heartbeat, tells you the weather, receives messages, and much more. This is an Apple Watch competitor that is much better for the price! It connects to Spotify which shocked me and it lets you stop and play songs. An added BONUS is that it comes with a FLASHLIGHT! It comes with a charger in the packaging and watch is the cutest thing EVER. I am very happy with my purchase.",
