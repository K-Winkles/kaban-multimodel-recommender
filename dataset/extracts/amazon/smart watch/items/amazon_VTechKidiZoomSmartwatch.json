                "reviewText": "My son asked for this from Santa after a friend of his had gotten one. He is 8 and this is just about perfect for him. It has enough features for him to be entertained with. He really likes that it has a camera and can make videos. It has some games which he likes to have while waiting around doing \u201cboring\u201d stuff like going to his sister\u2019s basketball game.I like that it isn\u2019t connected to the internet, but has smart features. It feels like a good introduction to moving towards his own smart device (as he gets older).The battery he charges every night but seems like it should last 2 or so days. The construction is well enough that it doesn\u2019t seem like it would break from everyday use. We took it off to play sports. Buttons are responsive, as is the touchscreen.Overall a great first smartwatch for an 8 year old!",

I tried to turn it on/ off and use different cable to charge it, but it did not work. I reached out to the VTech company after 3 months (because I was busy and never thought warranty would be only 3 months) and they refused to replace it. The warranty is only 3 months because it is really cheap, and it might go dysfunctional really quickly. I am very upset with this experience, as I was a big fan of their products.Update 7/28/2022:I contacted the VTech support, they advised me how to fix the issue and now the watch is working. I will update this post if it stops working again. The VTech did show cooperation to replace it if the issue did not resolve...",
