The watch is perfectly accurate in all measurements, very comfortable on the hand. All messages are perfectly readable due to the large Amoled screen. New options such as answering calls and dialing numbers. and I really like the rare non-switchable screen option. That is, if I turn on this option, then a simplified economical version of the time readings always lights up on the screen. There is a choice of digital, analog or disable option. It is clear that the energy consumption is somewhat higher, but it is worth it. A very successful and well-made model. The highest score.",

I haven't had any issues and battery lasses a good 4-5 days before recharge it. I don't know what's the range of the Bluetooth feature but I left my phone charging in my office two floors away and I was able to receive a call on the watch. If you love listening to music while working you can keep your phone on the charger and listen to music through the watch by using the media audio feature on the watch you can also play and pause the music through the watch. Any guy would love this watch for he's birthday, Father's day and Christmas. Ladies there's also a women's feature that keeps track of your pregnancy and health.",

This smartwatch can pretty much do anything that other smartwatches can do, apart from texting as this watch can only read incoming texts but it cannot send outgoing texts, which is important to me. Other than that, this is a heavy duty, solid, and easy to read and operate smartwatch.I highly recommend this to others.",
