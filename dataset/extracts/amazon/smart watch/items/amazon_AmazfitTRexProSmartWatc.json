                "reviewText": "I was not really sure I needed a smart watch, so this purchase was a test run to understand the workings and benefits a smartwatch offers.The model I am reviewing is not the latest offering and it is a refurbished item. However, it is a really good match for what I figured my discovery needs would be. It hit every mark and then some.Here are my high points in sort of bullet point form: The watch mates with an app on my cell phone. The app is easy to download, has tons of data and fairly simple to use. The short side is that it is a bit slow on my phone, an older Samsung. (My phone is off most of the day. So, this may contribute to slow.) There are a lot of features, but I just use a few regularly; workout-walking, sleep measurements, heart rate and good old time/date. Walking is what I do for exercise. The watch tracks and stores a lot of walking workout data. Some unexpected things like elevation change, heart rate chart, step count and length along with a measured GPS track. Very cool. That data is stored in the Zepp app on my phone and up-dates seamlessly when the Zepp app is active. Custom faces are available for free and up to 2 bucks inside the app. A tad addictive here since there are a lot of choices. I think I downloaded at least six and have one that seems to be my daily user. More of the cool factor here.Some closing comments since there is really too many features to detail in full. I have just covered the things I use and find helpful. My pre-purchase regimen is to look at several on-line video reviews and there was plenty of material out there for a good decision. Briefly on measurements, I have no way to test the accuracy of the data. But it does seem to be reasonably, intuitively, accurate. Finally, my experience with a renewed item: It shipped quickly and came in the original box in like new condition.This watch did inspire me to do more on my workout. The data produced showed me that I was not doing enough work even though I thought I was. Just a little more effort and the stats looked way better.In closing, it is above my expectations in build quality, features, app interface and overall utility.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased a couple months ago and overall I love it. The workout settings are great and help motivate me to get out and get working. Blutooth control works perfectly for music, the GPS for outdoor runs is very accurate. I can keep my phone on silent and the watch alerts me for calls and texts. Battery life is excellent, and it's built tough.On the not so good list,The sensors for sleep must be programmed off of the heart sensor, which kinda sucks. It skips whole hours of the day and night and sends alerts to get a sleep study.The alerts for movement and steps are very annoying and don't take into account what time of day it is. Every night without fail it tells me to get up and get moving when I'm about to fall asleep in bed. I'm sure there is a way to disable it but I haven't found it yet for the final reason I dislike.The menu system is totally non intuitive. Typical for Chinese products, it is rather hard to navigate and find what you need.Overall it's pretty good, and I'm happy with the purchase",

I whitewater kayak, hike, backpack, hunt, fish, trail run and work on all kinds of things. I don't take off my watch, because what good is a watch if it isn't on your body. This is very durable, it has gone down many class 3 - 4+ rivers and has a couple of minor scratches on the face, but that is without a screen protector, which is my fault. I love the number of features you get with this watch. It has amazing battery life. I was a little concerned about the origin of the watch, but I am very pleased with it. I have friends that use Garmin, Apple, Google, Fitbit, etc. and all are impressed with the number of features in this watch. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for watch that will withstand the abuse of physical activities. I liked it so much, I bought one for my father, who also loves the watch. I do think I will buy a screen protector for it though. Good luck and live life to it's fullest.",
