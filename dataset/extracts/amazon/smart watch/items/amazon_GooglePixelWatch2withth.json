                "reviewText": "I tried the Samsung Galaxy 5 Pro watch, then the Galaxy 6 watch, then the FitBit Sense 2, and finally this Google Pixel Watch 2. Of all of them, Pixel Watch 2 is by far the best I have used to date, including comfort, style, and most especially the intuitively designed app. It's extremely easy to use, it pairs with my phone and smart devices very easily, and the OS is incredibly responsive (all the others were very slow and sometimes glitchy, though I respect the Sense 2 for being measurably less so than the Samsung models). I'm usually a Samsung fanatic, and have been skeptical about Google hardware for many years, but after reading countless reviews, I finally decided to give the 2 a chance, and I'm very glad I did. It is very rare for me to fall immediately in love with any technology, and I am a very \"picky eater\" as a tech professional. The fact that Google is integrating the cutting-edge sensors of FitBit (after the M&A) with this crisp, intuitive OS may play into what I feel is a \"best of both worlds\" situation here. I'm not sure whether I'll try the Pixel phones again (years back I was unimpressed with an early iteration), but this watch is making me think that Google might have learned an awful lot since then, and I may have to give their Pixel another chance. In any case, I FINALLY have a smartwatch that I love after weeks of testing and study. Well done, Google; I have a feeling that the devices will only improve further from here in the watch category.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love it, I wish I had gotten a smart watch sooner",
                "reviewText": "I've been loving this watch since I first put it on. From what I've read, the Samsung Galaxy watch is considered better, but you need an additional wireless plan, and I didn't want that. The Pixel Watch 2 has a bluetooth/wifi option and that is good enough for me. I already had a Pixel 8, so it works seamlessly with my phone.I also really like how customizable the phone is. There are lots of watch face options and you can even further customize each watch face. There are also downloadable watch face apps for even more options. I have not explored this too much beyond what is included on the watch. There are lots of accessories available to customize the look of the watch. It comes with a basic silicon strap. It's fine, but you can find different colors and styles of bands and cases.I have two main complaints...1) Battery Life - You have to charge it once a day on average. I like using it to track my sleep, so I need to charge it during the day. That being said, it charges quickly. I've gotten in the habit of charging it in the morning when I sit down to start my work day.2) Charging Cable - It has a special, unique charging cable. It doesn't plug in, it uses a magnet to attach. It's always annoying having special cables for charging. It is also a different charging cable/mechanism than the previous model.Additional Concerns... You need to get a protective case. It's a watch, you will bump it into stuff, drop it, etc. Just a screen protector will not cut it. The curved body means a film protector will come off more easily. There are plenty of cheap options for protective cases available, though.",

                "reviewText": "I liked the setup of the watch. I liked how well it was made. The only flaw I've had is you can't sync photos or create a watch face without a third party app installed on the phone. It also was a little bare bones in terms of apps. I had to personally install a calculator, compass, and maps to the device. Apple has this standard on theirs. All from the app store as a separate app. I get that most people don't like some of these apps. At least they should have had it as a feature that could be uninstalled. I did not like that changing wrist straps was a little difficult to do out of the box. It took a little force to remove the straps it came with. The other thing is a fitbit account and app is also required to use basic features of this product. Not all in one like Apple. It's still a good buy for android users. Just a little bit of a resource hog on the phone for those with little built in storage. Otherwise a good product who want to get healthy. Just don't get roped into fitbit premium subscription that is yet another worthless subscription that you don't absolutely need.",

                "reviewText": "Having a battery that lasts less than 20 hours even with the always-on screen ruins most applications of this watch. You can't measure sleep if it has to charge with your sleep, and if you're not charging it every morning for an hour you're likely going to run out of battery when you need it most.That said, it also doesn't function well as an athletic tracker as checking the screen will sometimes lag the timer, meaning I often have a longer clock time than I do a stop watch time for the same unpaused periods of time.Speaking of pauses, on multiple occasions I will take the stop watch off pause only to see it has repaused a few moments after checking, and the heart rate monitor will periodically drop ten to twenty bpm for thirty seconds throughout long cardio sessions, as if it's losing detection for some of that.If you're looking for a smart watch there are better cheaperIf you're looking for a fitness band, get the sense 2 or literally anything but thisIf you have an active life this is not the watch for you",

Due to its small size and light feel, sleep tracking is not a problem as you can easily forget it's there.The biometrics seem to be good, all the regular / expected tracking is there, as well as an AFib detection and ECG features. I was worried you would need Fitbit premium to use all the features but from my perspective Fitbit premium seems useless, and you can use your watch to its fullest without. Keep in mind this watch is small, if you want a bulky watch this is not it.I use mine with my pixel 7 pro, and have had no issues, haptics are great, battery is slightly over 24 hrs with default settings (or so I found). I'd recommend finding a silicone stand to put the charger cord in to keep everything organized.",
