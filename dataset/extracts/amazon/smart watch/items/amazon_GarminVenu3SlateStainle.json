                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this! I have been a Fitbit person almost since they came out years ago. Since they were acquired by Google, quality has really gone down. The latest app update was horrible, I absolutely hate the Fitbit app now, so started looking for other alternatives. This watch is great! It is so easy to set up, very fast to get it up and going, and it\u2019s way more accurate than Fitbit. I suspected hat Fitbit was cheating me out of a lot of zone minutes in yoga, as well as in running. Where I was only getting about 11 zone minutes for power yoga on my Fitbit, I now get 40 on Garmin, which made a lot more sense to me. Heart rate is way more accurate on the Garmin. I know when my heart rate is up, and Fitbit was missing it. I also wondered what food app I was going to use (not crazy about my fitness pal) but I decided to just keep using the Fitbit app for food. It\u2019s easy enough to subtract food calories via Fitbit from total calorie expenditure via Garmin without much fuss. I do like the Fitbit app for logging food since I\u2019ve been using it for years and all my food is already in there. I don\u2019t mind staying with that. Garmin also has so many different apps that you can use, it\u2019s really great and far better than any of the Fitbits I\u2019ve had. I also love that it\u2019s a smart watch, I can make calls, answer the phone, reply to texts etc. on my iPhone. For text replies, I just use Siri which is easily accessible by pressing the side button. Overall, the Garmin is much more accurate, easy to use, and the app is really nice looking and you get a ton of stats. It\u2019s also easy to read and has a black background so it\u2019s not glaring like the Fitbit app is now. Lots of different meditations, a ton of workouts that you don\u2019t have to subscribe to get. So glad I decided to go with Garmin, highly recommend!",

I cant believe the amount of info this provides (HR, ECG, respirations body battery, steps, intensity minutes, pulse ox, HRV, calories stress, HR Zones, etc). The band is very comfortable and the watch face can be modified to your liking. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly. I love the flashlight option and the dial pad to make phone calls. The volume can be adjusted to take calls & it's quite loud. This is the BEST Garmin watch I have ever owned. Love, love, love it!",

As I had come for more than one Apple Watch this does not need charging every day like an Apple Watch I go 10 to 14 days on a charge.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Pricey but Nice Alternative to a Smart Watch or FItbit",
                "reviewText": "I started looking for a new smart watch / exercise tracker after Fitbit dumbed down their app by eliminating a good deal of precision in times and miles run and also redoing their formerly excellent data display and organization a few months ago.I do not like charging a watch every night, which is necessary for the dominant smart watches, and do not like their tight linkages to particular phone-based eco systems.So I tried purchased a Garmin Venu 3 from Amazon a little over a month ago. For my purposes, it is not a massive improvement over a good Fitbit (prior to the dumbing down), but like the Fitbits that I've owned, it has excellent battery life (4-5 days or so is common), and is smart enough for my purposes.It was, of course, more expensive than the Fitbits that I've owned, but you do get somewhat more for one's money.The screen is larger, brighter, and depending on the screen face that one adopts, more informative and easier to read--both during a daytime run and at night. The touch screen is more touch friendly--it seems more sensitive and being a bit larger is easier to touch in the \"right\" spot to activate an app etc.It also provides more data, much of it useful, than Fitbits do.Although the manner in which Garman displays the data in the app is not as good as the older fitbit data display, its generally better than their new app (as of Dec 2023). Also, many of the calculations are undertaken on the watch itself rather than transmitted to mother google, so one can, for example, look at sleep scores, run times, distances, and so forth even if one is off line.Overall, I am very pleased with the Venu 3. Its good looking, easy to read, has lots of flexibility (e.g. its pretty \"smart\") and quite easy to set up and get going--as is the app.",

                "reviewText": "This is a significant upgrade from the original Garmin Venu that I have had for years. The additional features and screen quality are exponentially better than the original version, which has been my go-to watch. I used to watch as my normal watch, and run about 30 mi a week with it. The battery is incredible, the screen is super clear, and the GPS locks almost instantly. I like it so much that my wife is probably about to upgrade her original Garmin to the smaller version (Venu 3s) of this as well.",
