                "reviewText": "The good: Value. Seriously, a legitimate smart watch that handles messages, health monitoring, apps, remote camera and more... for under $70...Right out of the box it was super easy to set up. Power on and it gives a barcode to scan with your phone to load the phone app. Click agree to pair, and you are up and running.The screen is sharp, vivid and responsive. I expected this to be a the opposite, and was pleasantly surprised.The apps are easy to access (swipe left to right)I like the weather app, and the health apps.Checks blood pressure - Apple and Samsung don't! Battery life. Absolutely epic. It drops 1% per 8 hours so far. As in, 3% per day!!! I am in disbelief, considering that my previous Samsung drops at a rate of 1.5% per hour. In other words, this watch has 10x the battery life of my Samsung. Want to charge your watch once a week? This is for you.The bad - the apps are limited and not very customizable. However, if you just want a full featured watch that does everything without needing to spend hours setting up, customizing... That is actually a good thing.To summarize, the extra health features that other watches don't have, simplicity to set up and learn, and the incredible battery life make it perfect for older people who want a smart watch but don't want a hobby just to learn it. For the money, this is a great watch.",

                "reviewText": "Watch arrived quickly and has very nice packaging. The app loaded seamlessly and I had it synced with my phone in 2 minutes. After going through the various options and features I wanted t overify the blood pressure accuracy. I compared the reading from the watch to my blood pressure monitor and it was within 5%, which is very impressive. The heart rate bpm was also very accurate.Next I wanted to see how it performed in the water. I am a competive swimmer and am in the pool daily. There were no issues.The phone works great for calls, messages and even has a decent speaker if you want to share music with your friends.The charging cable attaches with a magnet and worksvery fast. I have used the watch for a week and have yet to recharge, nice battery life.I give this watch 5 stars all around. It is comfortable, rugged, nice looking and vey useful.",
