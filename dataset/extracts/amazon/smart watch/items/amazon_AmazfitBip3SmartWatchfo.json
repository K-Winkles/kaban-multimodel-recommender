                "reviewText": "I've been really pleased with the battery life on this smart watch. Most smart watches in this price range seem to have a battery life of 3-7 days. That's a complete deal breaker for me.So far my Amazfit BIP 3 Pro lasts as much as 20 days per charge - 5 or 6 days longer than the 14 days per charge that was advertised. And recharging it (even when it is nearly dead) only takes about an hour to an hour and a half. I am VERY pleased with that aspect of its performance. Hopefully that doesn't change or degrade over time, because it is the number one thing I like most about this smart watch.The other good things are that the step counting function seems to be pretty accurate when compared to my phone. The Zepp app synchronization with my Android phone seems to work pretty well also. The blood O2 saturation and heart rate functions also seem to work well and be pretty accurate.Unfortunately the sleep monitoring function doesn't seem very accurate at all. It consistently under-reports my hours of sleep, and it shows basically none of my sleep time as deep (REM) sleep.The \"stress\" monitoring function seems a bit hit-or-miss.The Zepp app needs a little work too, as it seems to randomly disconnect from the watch and sometimes reconnecting only requires toggling my phone's bluetooth off and back on to resolve the problem, but at other times it seems that the only thing that will get it to reconnect is to a completely restart my phone. That can be pretty frustrating.All in all, for the price, I feel like this watch is a decent value. Time will tell whether I continue to feel that way over the long-term.",

                "reviewText": "I had a fitness tracker watch before this one (GRV with InxFit app). I didn't like the proprietary app that came with the first watch so I decided to look for a second one. Being able to work with Google Fit was very important to me because I like to see all my fitness data in one place. This watch syncs very easily with Google Fit and the Zepp app is pretty good on its own, too. The app shows you your walking/running/cycling route as long as you take your phone with you (and record the workout when you begin). Shows you all the fitness data points you'd expect from a watch, including something called PAI. I'm very happy with this watch, it looks very nice and works well. You will probably have to pay $1 or $2 for a nice watch face if you want the kind that has all your fitness info right on it but other than that I recommend the watch to most general users.I will also say that if you don't have a fitness tracker and are looking to get your first one, this is a very good start for a reasonable entry price. Having a fitness tracker watch really does incentivize you to move more, get healthier and I highly recommend it. Even if you don't get THIS watch, get A watch.",

Across the board, the sensors seem flawed or limited. A few examples:- For runs, the distance clocked on the watch are literally miles off. If I run 4 miles, it will say 2.5 miles.- For sleep, the watch does not seem to be able to distinguish from time spent reading vs. when I\u2019m actually asleep, causing it to consistently overestimate my sleeping time and quality.- For walking, it doesn\u2019t seem to count any steps if I\u2019m moving about with something in my hand, whereas it seems to think I\u2019m walking (and counts \u201csteps\u201d) if I\u2019m folding laundry or something.",

Os dados podem n\u00e3o ter precis\u00e3o total mas aparentemente d\u00e1 pra ir regulando isso aos poucos ao confirmar ou corrigir a dist\u00e2ncia percorrida, por exemplo, ao final do exerc\u00edcio. GPS funciona legal e d\u00e1 pra monitorar bem o b\u00e1sico, com alerta de vibra\u00e7\u00e3o a cada km, por exemplo, ou para indicar faixas de frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca. Satisfeito com a compra.",
