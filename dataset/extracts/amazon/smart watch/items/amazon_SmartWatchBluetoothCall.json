I have used the watch to track my steps and my sleep which is great. However when syncing the watch to the GloryFit app, I have had issues with it. I have had to restart the app a couple times before it works properly. I had a different watch the used the DFit app which had its own issues. This watch's battery life is great, I have not had to charge as frequently as other watches. I can't speak on how waterproof the watch is, but I think it is a very nice watch. Comfortable to wear and easy to use. I have answered my phone with it a couple times which was great. I would recommend this watch for someone who wants one that doesn't need to be synced via Bluetooth all day long. The app can be iffy, but once synced it loads all your stats to your account.",

                "reviewText": "Like many of the seemingly endless variations of budget priced Chinese made activity watches on offer the G25 (the model number, the watch itself has no brand name on it and the packaging is generic) is a mixed bag relative to premium brand watches from Garmin and Apple. The brand name watches just have more highly developed firmware, functionality and interfaces, even if they are less flashy, and a more coherent use of stats.All of these budget activity watches have certain features in common, including touch interface TFT screens, usually only a single LED emitter on the back for deriving pulse etc, a snappy and snazzy looking color display but poor readability in very bright light, and limited Bluetooth compatibility with anything other than the seller's phone app. I tend to think the real money is being made from the data collected by and from the app more than from selling the watches themselves.That said, and comparing this watch to other similar types of budget watches, this is a pretty good example of a budget priced activity and sports watch. On the plus side it has a much deeper library of watch faces and display options than some other budget watches that I have recently tried, and many that I have owned in the past. It can display the usual range of info like steps, distance, heart rate, etc. and derive stats about rest and stress and even blood pressure from what can be made of heart rate from the single LED. On the down side the watch was unable to pair with my phone, and so be a source of data to my favorite sports app, unless I was using the seller's app, the display had no time out adjustment and went to standby way too quickly, and the watch face displayed ongoing stats, like heart rate, in type so small it was almost illegible. There were other data only displays that showed heart rate and steps data more clearly, but the watch faces did a poor job of making the info readable at a glance.So, a pretty good watch relative to competing Chinese budget sports watches, although I suspect that all of the watches like this on offer are being churned out in one huge watch factory somewhere in China and then sold under a blizzard of various importer names via Amazon. ALl tha said, if you have to go for a budget solution to have a heart rate monitor sports watch this is a good looking and competent one at about fifty dollars.",

                "reviewText": "This watch arrived, and was destined to be my sons first smart watch of his own. He had previously used one of my older apple watches, and it was a total novelty. I actually think this watch is his preference, even though it's substantially cheaper.From the aesthetics, it's a decent looking watch, very large face, and decent quality image. The band felt a little cheap and plastic for my taste, but very appropriate for my son. You need to install an app to use the watch correctly, it's available on apple and android, and is super easy to get started with. My son spent hours on customizing it to his needs, and has become very attached to the watch.Battery life is OK, it certainly can last a full day on a single charge, but 2 days was pushing it, but this was with HEAVY usage. The screen must have been on at least 12 hours! With the fitness and health features, I've found my son has started wearing it every day, somewhat obsessed with monitoring his \"stats\".I'm not sure I'd recommend this for an adult, as it's a little basic, but for the price, it's a great option for someone looking for a budget watch, or a very solid option for the first watch for your child.",

At this rate, in a month, the battery will last for a few hours. Also, there is no app on the watch to measure fitness routines such as weight training or yoga or other fitness classesOriginal review:The watchface I use has an analogue clock. The second hand flows smoothly across the seconds instead of halting on each second. The watchface also has day and date, weather, heart rate, and stepsThe watch can also give blood pressure as well as the usual heart rate and blood oxygen. DaFit is the app and I like it, although the watchfaces it offers are extremely childishThe measurements of the watch are not accurate but they're in the ballpark. e.g. The blood pressure may read 118/70 and the actual is 121/72. Ditto heart rate. I don't count steps but I have a measure that I can approximate and, again, the watch is in the ballparkBy default, the app shows outdoor running. If you use an exercise on the watch, the app records that as wellThe first time I charged the watch, it lasted about eight days. The watch notifies you when the battery is low. I charged it and forgot about it. I don't know how long it was charging. Again, lasted about eight days. The third charge lasted two days and it's charging right now. It will be interesting to see how long the battery lastsThe negative is the band. Inside, it's red and it's uncomfortable to wear",
