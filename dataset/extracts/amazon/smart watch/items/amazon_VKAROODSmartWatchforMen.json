I love how straightforward setting this watch up was unlike some of the more expensive watches that like to make life difficult to look fancy. One of my favorite features is how this watch does not require constant charging like other smart watches I have used. It is lightweight, made of sturdy material, easily connects to phones, is comfortable to wear and comes with two wrist straps to choose from; one metal and one silicon. It also comes with an 18 months warranty which proves how confident the seller is in their product.As far as using the watch goes, the screen is high quality and navigating through its menus is smooth and intuitive. It has all the functionalities I need and from what I've seen so far it seems to do a better job of measuring vitals than other smart watches I have tried. It accepts calls smoothly, shows text messages I receive clearly and has a flashlight function. It is also customizable and has a good sized library of watch faces to choose from. This is a product I would recommend to anyone on a budget that is looking for a high quality smart watch.",

The messages come through on time as well as calls. The watch is lightweight and easy to wear. I like that you get both a metal and silicone strap as I am unable to wear metal due to allergies to nickle. The watch causes no issues. Well packaged, easy to put on the strap you want. Cant ask for more especially at about 1/7th the cost.Screen is bright and has a nice usb magnetic charger that clicks right in. Charges quickly.I havent tried the sleep feature, but the rest work well.",

I was looking for inexpensive, decent quality watch for daily use, exercise etc and when I came across this one I was pleasantly surprised. The wristband and the watch itself are made out of good quality materials (heavy and comfortable) and look great. The display, and the menu of the watch is easy to navigate and very intuitive. I would recommend this watch as it seems to be a great product so far.",

                "reviewText": "I used Fitbit watches for years and was accustomed to tracking some data like steps and sleep. After some failures, I switched to a Samsung watch. While it has many capabilities, I have never been satisfied and really hate having to charge the watch constantly.This watch is several times less expensive than those name brands and does everything I need in a simpler way. I have tried out a few watch-faces and have not yet decided which I prefer. It was extremely easy to set up and seems to do a better job of measuring blood pressure than the Samsung watch. I is very close to what my home blood pressure test kit registers. This gives me confidence that it\u2019s measurement will be accurate. The sleep data is as robust as others as well. I use the Heart Rate, SpO2 (Oxygen level), Blood Pressure, and sleep data to help monitor my personal health. The weather screen is superior to previous watches I have owned.It accepts calls, shows my messages, and has many features I have only started to look at. It even has a flashlight function. It isn\u2019t extremely bright, but great in a pinch.Overall, I am very please so far. I would like a second charging cord, so maybe that will be something I look for down the road. I really like that it takes a standard band vs the proprietary bands from the big brands.",

The watch effortlessly connects with my phone for calls and messages, making it seem like a fantastic deal. ! Oh, and it comes with an 18-month warranty. Will update more updates in a few days about the experience.",
