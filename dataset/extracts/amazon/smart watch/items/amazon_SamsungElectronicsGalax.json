One thing I like is it has many apps you can shop on Google Play just like a Phone. It has some interesting Health and Fitness Apps I haven't even delved into yet. I'm sure the ideas are numerous. I keep up with my Heart Rate, Daily Steps and I like an Analog with also Digital Time Face. I even got a nice Defender Type Watch Strap/Incasement for it to wear. The battery does need to be charged about once a day.",

Strap is just ok but easily changed. the charger works great. First time i charged it it only lasted about 20 hours. I was disappointed but i fully charged it and it has been going for 28 hours and is at 46% so battery life looks like it is going to be great. First day was a lot of downloads and updates so that probably did it. So far everything is working and i am still learning how to use it. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend.",
