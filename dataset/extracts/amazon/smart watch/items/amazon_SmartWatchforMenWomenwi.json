                "media_text": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------FQA-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Q: How to connect the watch to your phone? A: Since the watch has the call function, the watch needs to be connected to dual bluetooth. (Connect \"IDW19\" in VeryFit and connect \"IDW19\" in phone's Bluetooth) * NOTE: The phone and watch should not be farther than ten meters during the connection process. Q: Why can't your watch receive SMS and notifications? 1.Please ensure the permissions of App, messages, calls, etc. are allowed when you download the VeryFit app for the first time. 2.Allow the VeryFit app to send notifications: Open your phone settings--> Find \u201cVeryFit\u201d app--> Notifications--> Click \u201cAllow Notifications\u201d--> Tick Lock Screen/Notification Center/banners, and tick \u201cAlways(Default)\u201d in Show Previews. *Note: Check whether the App's messages appear in pop-up box of your mobile phone. If no, the watch will fail to receive messages. Make sure they are able to show up: Phone Settings-->Notifications> Find the app you need to get notification from-->Allow Notifications. 3.In the App: authorize the watch to receive messages. Do not enable the DND mode. Q: Why is the watch usage time shorter? A:If the call function of the watch is always turned on, it will increase the power consumption and reduce the battery usage time. Do not use the fast charging head to charge the watch. Excessive current of the fast charging head will damage the battery and lead to battery losses. Q: Why is it not recommended for deep water sports or bathing? A: The watch can be used for daily life waterproofing. Not suitable for bathing, diving, sea water, hot springs, sauna, other wading or deep water activities under high-speed water flow. Because the watch has a call function and has a sound hole. Water vapor or high-speed water flow can easily enter the inside of the watch through the small holes of the watch, causing the watch to corrode. Q: How to measure my heart rate & steps more accurately? 1. Please make sure your personal info(age,height,weight) in VeryFit app are filled in correctly.(Go to VeryFit app -> User -> My info) Swing of the arm, slight movement of the watch on your skin, etc., wearing too tight, raising the arm and making a fist, etc. can affect your blood circulation and thus affect the HR signal. This is normal that the heart rate data will be volatile at start. You will find that the data will be more accurate, if you measure more times and test longer.",

                "reviewText": "I have had Android Wear OS watches for years that cost $200 to $300. After the battery wore out in my latest watch, I decided to give this smart watch a try, although I was skeptical that it only costs around $40. Yes, this watch is plastic instead of metal and perhaps does not have a tough Gorilla Glass face, but boy, does it work well. It does not have all the integrations with my Android phone that Wear OS does, but it has the important ones, and I would say it works better and easier than Wear OS.The watch is easy to set up with the VeryFit app on my phone, and I liked how easy to was to determine what notifications you want to display on the watch. I find that if I get too many notifications, I start ignoring them, so for my watch I only wanted SMS messages and a certain email account. This was easy to select in the app. There are many watch faces to choose from, but I do wish that I could customize the face more by selecting font, font size, color, which data is displayed, etc. This is actually my biggest request, especially for my friend who also got one of these watches and is visually impaired. Being able to include more bits of weather data would be nice.The phone works very well. Calls are easy to answer and the speaker and microphone are good enough to easily have entire conversations with the watch. For an incoming call, though, there is not as much caller ID info displayed as I got with Wear OS. Also, outgoing calls need to be made from a limited favorites list that you create for the watch using the VeryFit App, so it is not as flexible as WearOS that taps into your contact list.I use other fitness tracking devices, so I have not really used the fitness and workout functions on the watch. It is nice to have your daily step count and heart rate always available. The numbers seem to be reasonably accurate, which is impressive.The Alexa feature works well, but again, is more limited than the Google assistant integration between Wear OS and Android.Battery life is excellent. I generally need to charge every three days. With my Wear OS watches, I was charging every night.In conclusion, there are watches that have a better integration with Android or Apple iOS, are more customizable, and look more like jewelry, but these generally will cost you a lot more money. If you want something affordable that gets the job done, I think this watch is an excellent choice. It does most everything it claims to do quite well and easily. I am very impressed.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got the \"Smart Watch for Men Women with Bluetooth Call, Alexa Built-in1.8 DIY Dial with Blood Oxygen Heart Rate Sleep Fitness Watch Notification Weather 100 Sport Modes Activity Trackers for Android iOS Phone\", and even though it has a silly long name, it's honestly a really good smart watch.To begin with, I am impressed by the extensive features this smartwatch provides;- The built-in heart rate monitor, and step counter have both worked great so far- it can set alarms- it also has the weather and the date & day on the watch- An activity tracker- it connects to your phone and accepts phone calls if you want along with notifications- it can connect to amazon's alexa if you log in- workout tracker/logs- it tracks your blood oxygen levels, I assume based on heart rate and activity- it has a stress tracker which does something similar- offers an optional reminder to take a breather when your heart rate is too high- it can also track menstrual cycles (you input how long yours is and when the last time was, along with how long your cycle is, and it just informs you when it's upcoming by 1-3 days)- it has music control for your phone and by extension your computer if you have spotify- it can track your sleep- it can offer a healthy breathing exercise to help calm you down- it can have a hand washing reminder and a water drinking reminder- it can wake when you raise your arm- and of course, it can tell the time.There's a long list of features, and one of the great things about this watch is that you can turn off and on all of the features that you want, the watch is highly customizable, it even has a customizable front display, so you can set a wallpaper or what info you want shown on it when you have it on. There are themes you can get from the app, and there's also a theme where you can set the wallpaper as anything and change the position/colour of the clock. (as see in my last image, the one with the fat lizard)The watch is really stylish in my opinion, it just has a nice matte look to the band and the display isn't too intrusive, it just looks nice in general. The display is very vibrant and it's really high resolution, higher than I actually expected, it's a very clear display even in direct sunlight. The battery life so far has been great, it can easily last throughout the day.The \"Smart Watch for Men Women with Bluetooth Call, Alexa Built-in1.8 DIY Dial with Blood Oxygen Heart Rate Sleep Fitness Watch Notification Weather 100 Sport Modes Activity Trackers for Android iOS Phone\" has exceeded my expectations, offering a blend of style and functionality at a reasonably low cost. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice smart watch.",

The first one I bought, just wouldn't sync up. I did everythig that 'support' said to do and still wouldn't sync. I returned it and got another. This time, everything worked seamlessly. This was in 8/23. Now 1/24, I can't talk through the device to answer calls. That was as big plus, when it worked. Now it's past the window for return so I'm stuck. Keep in mind, it's STILL a great watch for the price. Everything else on it works just fine. I work out on a treadmill that has a 'trainer' and I use a heart monitor. I compare the heart monitor that provides bluetooth info to the treadmill with this watch and they are always the same. Love that it shows me BPM, steps, calories burned, miles walked, Spo2 and SO much more. I'm still going use it just as it is. Great little smart watch.",

                "reviewText": "Choosing the MILOUZ Smart Watch over a pricier Apple Watch, a decision I'm thrilled with, has proven to be a wise investment. While friends spent over $600 on their devices, I opted to spend just a fraction of that cost for a product that impresses. The 1.8-inch screen is sizable, offering clear and crisp displays of information, reaffirming the value I've found in this budget-friendly alternative. As someone meticulous about health, the watch's meticulous health tracking features have been invaluable. Monitoring my sleep length and quality, it serves as a gentle reminder to prioritize adequate rest. Addressing concerns about a rapid heartbeat (over 90 times per minute), the watch prompts me to engage in mild exercise, fostering a proactive approach to my well-being.But it's not just about health \u2013 this watch goes above and beyond. With Bluetooth calls and Alexa Built-in, it's more than just convenient; it's a lifesaver. No need to lug my phone around the house anymore \u2013 the watch discreetly lets me know when there's a message, keeping me connected without any fuss.Oh, and I used to rock a Fitbit, but the short battery life drove me nuts. This MILOUZ watch? It lasts a whole week! I just charge it during bath time, and it's good to go before I hit the hay. Plus, I can even wear it while washing my hands \u2013 super handy.To sum it up, the MILOUZ Smart Watch isn't just a tech accessory; it's my go-to for style, practicality, and staying on top of my health game. Seriously worth checking out if you want a smartwatch that's got your back.",

The steps counting and distances are reasonably accurate, in my estimation.Sleep tracking is probably one of the most ludicrous features of ANY smart phone. Don't take it seriously.I have NO hesitation in recommending this smart watch to anyone.The appearance of the watch is fine. Only watches with smaller dimensions can be regarded more elegant or stylish.The app, VeryFit (akin to VeryFit Pro), is probably one of the best fitness-orientated apps out there.In summary, I would thoroughly recommend this smart watch.",

Would purchase this item again especially because of the extra ease of connectivity and super clear and loud speaker call feature. This is a quality item and it takes a few tries to find what watch is worth the cost. This one also has a very nice looking interface that makes it seems well planned and high end.
