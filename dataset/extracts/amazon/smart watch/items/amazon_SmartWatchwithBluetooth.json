                "reviewText": "P66 Smart Watch, my first purchase for this type of product\u2026Pros: soft, comfortable, and durable silicone wrist bands with metal buckles (and you get two); high polished rectangular glass screen about 1 5/8 inches height and 1 3/8 inches width with great color and resolution; one multi-purpose button for on/off and return to home screen; 7 screens include widgets, home/main, steps/mileage, heartrate, oxygen level, sleep monitor, weather\u2026all seem to be non-customizable except for the widgets screen which allows for different \u201cthemes\u201d in the Settings Menu to change the screen arrangement, all seven screens are very well laid out. Cons: my weather screen had the wrong location and corresponding weather details and I could not find how to select/change to the correct location in the GloryFit app; my phone Bluetooth connection showed repeated intermittent \u201cactive\u201d status, not sure why, although this didn\u2019t seem to affect performance that I\u2019m aware of; user manual, USA customer service number/email, or web site online help needs to provide better/more details for setup and operation. Note: This watch benefits greatly with the GloryFit app on your phone, if not loaded then you cannot set the correct date/time, input personal data, and many features do not work. Oxygen sensor readings are higher than my fingertip pulse oximeter, but I believe that technology is above that in smart watches. Final: I think this is a high-quality and high-value product so far and will explore it\u2019s many additional features, i.e. phone calls, text messaging, media.",

                "reviewText": "This watch was purchased to keep me active on a budget. It does pretty much everything most people want for a fraction of the price. I am able to keep track on my steps, distance and overall calories for daily targets and the APP is very easy to use. As most other smart watches, it also allows me to control music, displays messages and notifications and even lets you answer calls from the device.For the price and features, this gets a 5 star!Anyone looking for a first time smartwatch should consider this for sure. All the features of other brands for a fraction of the cost. It also looks great, and comes in different colours.Very Pleased!",
