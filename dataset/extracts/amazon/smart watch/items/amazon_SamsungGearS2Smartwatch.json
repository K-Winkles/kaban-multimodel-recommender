                "reviewText": "I currently have this and the Apple Watch. I own an iPhone 6 Plus and a Galaxy Note 5.At this time, I currently prefer this watch over my Apple Watch.It has way more customization options.It presents data in a clear and concise manner. Any app I choose to receive notifications from, it does so in a very clean and easy to use interface.S-voice on phones and tablets seem to be sub-par compared to Google Now and Siri; but on this watch, it satisfactorily fulfills its functions as needed.Compared to my Apple Watch, it is very light. This makes it easy to wear all day. With my Apple Watch, I can't wait to take it off at the end of the day. This watch, I have to remember to take it off at the end of the day.I may buy the 'Classic' version of this watch with the cellular radio inside it, but I'm not sure how much that will be needed since this watch performs all of the functions I need without it. However, the 3G version of this watch appears to be bigger so I may not:DimensionBT 42.3 x 49.8 x 11.4 mmBT classic 39.9 x 43.6 x 11.4 mm3G 44.0 x 51.8 x 13.4 mm(information obtained from Samsung's official website for the Gear S2)The bezel is a great dual function feature. Not only does it allow fast and easy navigation through the watch's interface (Tizen OS), but it already has paid itself off by protecting my watch screen from damage since the bezel is a 'lip' around the watch's screen. My Apple Watch screen already has dings and scratches on it, but not on the S2 because the bezel helps protect the Gear S2's screen. This is a big plus for me since I always seem to like to take tight turns around corners while I'm walking and always seem to somehow bang my watch against the corners of walls, doors, etc.The only thing I can see that might turn people off from this watch is the band may 'feel' cheap. But rest assured it is not. It is very light and yet durable enough for the rigors of 'normal' daily life. I'm not an avid sports activity type of person, so I cannot vouch for it on that level. For me I do a lot of walking and hiking. There's not much 'contact' as someone who plays basketball, hockey or football or whatever. Although if I were that kind of person, I would be taking it off before I did any of those things anyway.Battery Life. It's been great so far. On light use (checking notifications as they actually come in), I get down to about 65-68% by the end of the day. If I'm playing around with it and demonstrating it to someone (family/friends) because they asked me to, I've seen it go down to about 50-53%. With my type of usage, I've yet to see it drop below 50%. So for me, I could probably get 2 days out of it. I doubt I could get 3 days though, even with how light my usage of the device is.I've heard that some people were able to pair up this watch with their iPhones (albeit at the expense of less functionality), but I have not tried it and really don't intend to. The universe might implode in on itself if people were to actually wear that combo in public on a large scale (this is a joke)!All in all, it is a great watch. Is it the best watch? In my honest opinion, I believe so. This is if you consider the Apple Watch to be the King of the Hill right now. I still think Android Wear has a long way to go; but this watch (with Tizen OS) proves that it can be very flexible in its use, many customization options for its appearances, and still be very useful and presentable all in one package.If your usage and/or beliefs in how a 'smart' watch should function mirrors my own, then you will love this watch too. But if you want a 'smart' watch that acts just like a phone with 3 billion apps that you can wear on your wrist, then maybe not so much.Samsung has demonstrated that it can be innovative on its own merit, and what they did here with the Tizen OS is a giant step in the right direction.Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I'm hoping to keep this brief and to the point of the product. There have been some mixed reviews but before you buy get one in your hands and see if you like the feel of it. I love the design although I wish it was just a tad bit bigger. I can see how this watch would be suitable for both male and female buyers. It's not too big but not too small. The body seems to be sturdy, I've given it a few bumps against the wall or a door and never damaged the watch. I also like the spinning face to navigate the software... awesome. I love the ability to customize the watch faces. When I get bored of one I just make a few changes for something fresh. The watch band is great for me, it's a bit sportier. With that said I hope to see some new band styles in the near future. I use this watch while I'm running and not had problems with heavy perspiration. Speaking of which the pedometer works well for me. For now I'm using this in conjunction with S Health and no problems so far. The heart monitor also works well for me. I like the slight vibration on the wrist for notifications, this works very nicely in situations where pulling out my cell phone would be considered rude. I don't care so much about texting on this device or phone call functionality. This connected perfectly on the first attempt with my Samsung S6 Edge and I haven't had a problem with losing Bluetooth connection. Oh, and battery life has been great. I place it on the charger every night but usually by the end of the day I still have 75% charge remaining. I'm curious as to what kind of apps that will come along for this device. They're kind of limited but I suppose that is to be expected. This is my first smartwatch and it's a great fit for me. It's very simple to operate and nothing ridiculous. Just a simple smartwatch and I like that. So far I would definitely buy again. I'm halfway tempted to buy the classic version as well but I may wait a while to see what new features come along.",
