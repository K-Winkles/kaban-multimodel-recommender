I take around 50 steps and it registers over 600. I have my suspicion on why this is but I won't comment for now. I'll update this post once I get in touch with customer service. There is no reason they shouldn't be able to provide a website to pull up on a computer or phone and correct these kind of issue.",

                "reviewText": "It is nice that it has screen choices. I like the analog face. The battery lasts days before it has to be recharged. The flashlight available on the screen is a good feature. It tracks sleep, and heart rate, displays the weather through the phone; tracks steps, though they are usually overstated because of arm motion, has an alarm feature, and timer, shows text messages, and more. I wish the watch face stayed on all the time at a low light level, but I guess that is why the battery lasts so long. For the price, this is a great value.",
