                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this smartwatch, and I am absolutely thrilled with its performance. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed. The watch arrived 100% charged, sparing me the initial wait time to start using it. Setting it up was a breeze \u2013 it effortlessly synced with my smartphone through the VeryFit app.The bright display caught my attention immediately, making it easy to read in any lighting condition. What truly sets this smartwatch apart is its customizable features, allowing me to tailor it to my preferences effortlessly. I've enabled all the features, including heart rate monitoring, weather updates, blood oxygen levels, and sleep tracking. Surprisingly, the battery life is exceptional, lasting about 10 days on a single charge.The wristband provided is a perfect blend of durability, lightweight design, and comfort. Having previously owned an Apple watch, I can confidently say that this smartwatch rivals it in terms of functionality at a fraction of the cost. The added bonus of seamless integration with Alexa adds another layer of convenience to my daily activities.If I were to nitpick, I'd express a desire for more bandwidth to accommodate additional \"Watch Faces.\" The current selection is great, but a bit more variety would be appreciated. Additionally, the motion sensor for the display activation can be hit or miss when I flip my wrist. However, considering the incredible value at under $60, these minor inconveniences are easily overlooked.In summary, this smartwatch earns a solid five stars from me. It delivers outstanding performance, impressive battery life, and a sleek design\u2014all at an unbeatable price point. Pound for pound, it's a top-notch device, and I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and affordable smartwatch.",

So far the watch is serving its purpose without any issues.The WNH is a solid, nice looking, stats heavy, watch to track and hopefully improve your health with. It would make a wonderful gift for yourself, family, or friends. I sincerely recommend it! Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect out of a smart watch at a $60 price point but boy was I not disappointed!It has a sleek look that pretty clearly aims for that sleek apple watch appearance. In fact, from a distance it's hard to tell that it's not an apple watch. It has all the smart watch features that you would expect:activity tracking, heart rate monitor, sleep monitor, weather, music control, call/message alerts, etc.I am pleasantly surprised at the quality, appearance, and feel. Charging is easy and battery life is much longer than my smart phone. Overall, this is a great little device to free up your hands while staying connected. Would recommend 5/5.",

When initially opening and turning on the watch I was surprised it came with a 100% charge. The watch is solidly built and not too bulky. I love how it comes with many features like call log, activity or exercise tracker, heart rate tracker, music player, and more. The interface of the watch is very simple and easy to use unlike other budget watches I\u2019ve tried. The thing I loved most about the WNH watch is the notification center and camera control button, I\u2019ve never seen any other budget watch that\u2019s had these features!! I\u2019m so glad I got this.",

The oxygen level sensor is not even found in my more expensive watch. Both are easy to use and the Android partner app keeps your history of the measurements. This watch seems to do everything (get weather, remote to music player, text messages, connect with phone calls) and it is incredible at this price point. The Android app has 100s of watch faces that you can download both free and ones for a small charge. The watch connects with the app via Bluetooth and pairing was easy and quick. The battery is listed at 150 hours and after over a week of usage I was only down to 35%. Buying this watch was a great find.",
