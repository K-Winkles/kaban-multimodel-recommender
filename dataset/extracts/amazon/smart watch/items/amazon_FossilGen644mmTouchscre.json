                "reviewText": "First of all, the body, band and crystal are all Fossil and offers a smartwatch with style that is not boring and typical like an apple or Samsung. I love it. It's rugged and comfortable to wear.It's important to recognize that what is behind the crystal is quality hardware that is not uniquely Fossil. Rather, it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with plenty of memory and battery. Outside of the Fossil splash screen on startup this is where Fossil ends and a quality smartwatch begins.The operating system is Wear OS by Google. This is the same as that on Samsung and tweaked some by Fossil to work with the buttons on the watch and have Fossil watch faces.Having read the negative reviews prior to buying this watch and now having used it for a month, I'd like to mention some considerations that should be made before buying.Before buying any device ask,\"how am I going to use it?\" This is a fully functional device that does everything, and it comes with everything turned on and multiple apps that do the same thing. This is so you can discover all that functionality. That is definitely not the way to leave it. If you do, you'll run into some confusing scenarios, battery drain and sluggish performance.So, I uninstalled the Nike apps. I've used MyFitnessPal from UnderArmor for years. I have it on my phone and links seamlessly with Google fit that comes part of the OS. I've deactivated Alexa. Google pay links with PayPal on my phone. I've uninstalled the 3rd party pulse, O2 and step counting apps. The native apps with WearOS work perfectly with the 3rd party apps on my phone. Media control works with Pi music player.I did have to install Outlook to see MY email but that was too easy.Now that I've had it for a month, I'm totally satisfied. It is only running what I need and everything else has been removed. As such the battery it's lasting for days (3 at least).I make changes to it all the time and it's safe to say all that I have now is a stylish arm piece that does exactly what I need, when I need and only what I need.Oh, don't buy the cover glass recommended by Amazon. Get glad what is described as rounded or beveled. Though any 9H glass will protect the center of the screen is frustrating to tap the cut edge of the cover glass and have it spur and crack. Broke 3 glass covers in 2 weeks. The rounded edge is superior.",

                "reviewText": "Reading these reviews, it is clear not everyone knows how to use their smartwatch, which means updating their device. So before giving my review, I will use my review to educate people.First, plug your smartwatch into your charger. Tap the top of the screen and swipe down. Next, tap on the gear icon. Tap the bottom of the screen and swipe up until you see \"system,\" then tap on it to select \"system.\" Tap the bottom and swipe up again until you see \"about\" and then tap on it \"about\" to select it. Tap and swipe up (again) and select \"System updates,\" and install the available updates. Your smartwatch will reboot, AND you will need to repeat this process until there are no more updates.Fossil, like any Android device, is not without its partnerships. Unfortunately, that is part of why the battery may drain faster; for example, you do not need two (2) heart monitoring apps. The excellent news is Fossil had the foresight not to lock in those bundled apps, and you can uninstall (remove) them safely.To bring up the list of installed apps, quickly press the middle button. A long press will bring up Google Assistant, so be sure to press fast to bring up the app menu instead. Next, select \"Play Store,\" and within \"Play Store,\" swipe down to \"My apps.\" Select the app you may wish to uninstall (remove). You can always reinstall (re-add) if you change your mind, and the system (important) apps are protected and do not have the option to remove, so you have nothing to worry about and can do this safely.In the Wear OS app (on your phone or tablet), you should also disable any notifications you do not need to be sent to your smartwatch. My phone already receives a lot of notifications, and not all of them do I need to be passed onto my smartwatch. This, too, can save battery power.Now my opinion is Fossil did an excellent job of making a smartwatch. Although this is the 1st smartwatch that I own myself, I have experienced using a few other brands (Apple, Fitbit, Samsung, Amazfit). The truth is the technology, no matter if you use Android or Apple, is not perfect. For example, if I wake up but remain lying in bed playing with my phone, it may still be counted as \"sleeping.\" And if I try to measure my exercise inside my house, taking 100 steps may be counted as only 80 because the GPS and step counting are not perfect if you remain in a confined space. This is the same for every brand smartwatch I have used; there is a small margin of error. If you are expecting absolute perfection, the technology, in general, is not there.That said, Fossil's battery, when you disable the \"always-on screen\" (located in the display setting), is suitable for well over a day with all the features enabled. The smartwatch is also durably made of solid stainless steel with a sold screen. They did not go cheap on the quality of the watch. I even took a long warm, soaking bath, going a bit above the swim test, and my smartwatch works fine. Fossil also supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, so I have the best of both worlds.Overall, I am satisfied with my Fossil smartwatch.",

                "reviewText": "The watch feels very nice on, it has decently nice capability such as Alexa, NFC for payments, ability to place and receive call/texts. change my spotify songs on the fly. The sleep tracking is there but only deep and light sleep but doesn't seem very accurate because it only said I woke up when I went to physically check my sleep, I was up for more then an hour prior to that. I do like all the apps to change the face of the watch as the basic ones do not work out well for me. It is fairly difficult to remove links unless you have the proper press tool, I was able to get it with a cell phone tool and a hammer for removing SIM cards. My biggest concern is the battery life, it has to be charged at around 18 hours and that is running with the screen off and extremely little use. I bring my charger everywhere I go. I would love to suggest the watch but the battery life is a huge drawback",
