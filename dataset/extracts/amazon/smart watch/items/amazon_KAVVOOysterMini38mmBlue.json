                "reviewText": "Pretty excited that 1- I have a smart watch and 2- I set it up myself lol.This is a really nice looking piece, love the traditional face it has but also that I can switch it up for holidays etc. I am far from tech savvy but I downloaded the app and synched it, changed a couple settings, added a few notifications I would like on\u2026 all by myself in just a few minutes!!!! lol.I finally decided to get one of these because many of my coworkers have them, seems nice to not have to carry my phone always but get notifications I might need right away. I\u2019m in the beginning of making a big changes for my health and I am excited to use those features of the watch to encourage me\u2026 it even has a reminder you can set if you are sitting still too long it reminds you to get up and move.Highly recommend, if I can figure it out you probably can too!",

Definitely feel like a $400-500 watch for a friction of the price.",

                "reviewText": "The only smartwatch I have ever owned is a Fitbit Inspire, which I use for time and tracking steps only. When I saw this on Amazon I was shocked at how beautiful it was for the price! This watch has a large face, and fits on my small wrist wonderfully without overwhelming me. It is a very elegant looking watch, with small details that set it apart from other smartwatches I have seen.This comes absolutely beautifully packaged, and I wish I could find the watch face that is on the box, as it is stunning! It is relatively easy to set up and pair, although the instructions that come with this are sorely lacking. It's basically a fold out quick guide, that shows you what app to install, how to power on/off, how to use the button, touch screen and bezel. The quick start guide is also in 15 languages other than English.The app that accompanies this is sorely lacking, but that is another review for another place. I carefully read the User and Privacy agreement since this is such a new company and was surprised at how detailed it is. There are many areas that need work on the app, but it does work somewhat with the watch, and is not a battery hog. I do wish that there was at least a Users guide on the app, since only the basic information is included in the box. There is a place on the app where you can contact them for feedback, which I did, and never heard back from them. The last time the app was updated was 9.27.23, so it appears the watch and app were put out, but no updates have been done.The smartwatch itself is nice. It keeps time well. The alarm is an annoying song, but easy to set up right from the watch. The step count is off significantly with my Fitbit (1-3000 steps daily), but I had the same problem when I used the Amazon Halo watch. The notifications work, but I turned them off once I realized that I was receiving notifications on everything (including email), even though I only ticked the boxes for messages and phone. The weather info doesn't work at all, and since there is no users guide, I have no idea how to get it to work. The flashlight is bright enough to get me through a dark room without stubbing my toe. There are numerous other features on this watch that are probably really nice, but I have no idea how they work, because there is no users guide.The price point on this is really good for a watch this beautiful, but without some kind of more detailed information on how it works/what it is capable of doing, it just becomes a beautiful expensive watch. I am not certain I would purchase again until/unless the bugs are worked out of it.",

I really like the interface, as it lends itself nicely to someone who is getting a smartwatch for the first time. the size is great for smaller wrists, and isnt overly bulky like many smart watches ive seen on the market today. it also has many of the features would expect on a smartwatch todThe one con i can think of for this watch is that it may be a little too fancy for everyday use. Especially if you wear more sporty or casual clothing day to day. However, if you say work in an office, or are just dressed more formally day to day, then i would definitely recommend this watch if you like the look.",
