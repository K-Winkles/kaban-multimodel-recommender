                "reviewText": "UPDATE: --- 3 days after receiving replacement--- I have run more rigorous testing, this time on the new replacement Tozo 5 received. As far as step counting is concerned I and thoroughly disenchanted with the watch. This from a company that I believe is produces outstanding products (I own several of their NC ear buds and the S4 Smart Watch). The step counter is just horrible! In my latest test I wore the S5 and my Samsung Watch 4 for an entire day to see exactly how far off their steps counts would be. Result: Samsung Watch 4: 13,513 Tozo S5: 11,481 which is the same difference I'd seen with my original S5, about a 15% undercount. Why does this matter (for me)? I am on a heath care plan that actually pays me to remain fit. It keeps track of my step counts to do this so a significant and regular undercount means something to me (although I am also a 'statistics' kind of guy, I love to compare how I do over the course time). So this Smart Watch fails pretty miserably. Is it because the Samsung Watch over counts? Nope, I can count my steps in short bursts and the Samsung Watch is pretty accurate but in many of those cases the Tozo S5 will show literally ZERO steps taken! The S4 I have is much better than the S5 in that regard as well, although not 100% but still close enough. OTHER THAN THE STEP COUNTER: The watch is first class. I reiterate, it is a great watch. Very good battery life, nice large and bright screen, everything one would want in a great ignore-the step-counter- watch. Perhaps I have special needs but regardless of those it's important one is aware of this shortcoming. TOZO: probably mostly in your code (algorithm) since the accelerometer is picking things up? Watch needs an update! --------------------------- Original Review ----------------------------------This is a preliminary review but it is being written out of frustration. I received the Tozo S5 1 day ago, charged it up, loaded the app on my phone and carried on with my normal day. I immediately noticed there was a problem, no steps were being registered. This is one of the primary reasons I purchased the watch, to track steps and my exercise walks. I called for support and of course Amazon agreed to accept the return and ship out a replacement, we both concluded that the step sensor was defective. However, after wearing the watch for a couple of hours I now noticed a step count. I assumed, no doubt incorrectly, that the watch wasn't defective and perhaps something 'activated' the step sensor. I cancelled the replacement. However, something was not right. The count seemed low so I decided on a course of action. I planned on comparing step counts across 2 watches. Day 2: after setting aside 2 watches - Tozo S5 and Samsung Watch 4 for the night, I woke up and put one on each wrist. I'm now one hour into the morning and my S5 has registered 138 steps, the Samsung Watch 4 at 245 steps. With that in mind I've just put on my Tozo S4 and walked around my living room. Samsung Watch 4 added 17 steps, Tozo S4 shows 17 steps and Tozo S5 'mysteriously' added 16 steps. Totally unacceptable! So I am awaiting a new Tozo S5 and will try it out when it arrives to see if the first one is defective. I'm a bit skeptical but will update this review once it has arrived and been tested. In the meantime this has to get 1 star.",

                "reviewText": "I had never used a smartwatch before, so I didn't want to commit to an expensive Apple watch. I checked out the Tozo S3. It is a fine watch, but it looked like everything else. Also kept having issues with the app not connecting to the watch. I almost gave up on smartwatches until I found the S5. What a great watch. The display is amazing. It also gives you access to way more apps and notifications that the previous watch. There is a bit more for me to learn, but I am having fun figuring it out. Would recommend if you are looking for a great smartwatch, but don't want to break the bank.",
