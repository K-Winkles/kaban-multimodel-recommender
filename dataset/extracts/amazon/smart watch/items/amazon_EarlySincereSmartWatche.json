                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works pretty well for the price, mimics a certain watch style, okay features",
                "reviewText": "For the most part, I will say this is a really a cheaper alternative to the higher brand name watches. It has a very similar look to the apple watch look with even the button being in the same spot. That being said, the OS is somewhat of a mix of apple and android but more so apple. This is a decent watch for the price you are paying if you just looking for something that you do not really care about getting beat up. I actually enjoy having this for more of active wear and daily use. I do not have to worry about it getting scratched up or anything like apple watch. For the most part, this watch works pretty well with the readings and such. The watch does use a smartphone in order to sync the time and such so you do not have to worry about the time needing updating the time which is great. You do not need to be at your phone in order to get certain readings or use certain features. The only reason you want want your phone near by is to answer calls on your watch. It can also give you notifications from your phone although I have not been able to respond with the watch which is fine. I tried it with both apple and android and the messages do show up so you are able to receive notification from both operating systems although it works better with android in my opinion. The band is pretty solid but it does still feel a little cheap. It is easy to install but I do not expect it to be high end quality. It does fit pretty comfortably on my wrist although it does attract a good amount of dust. I do actually prefer to have a different band which is not silicone but I have not found anything that can replace this as of yet. In order to make sure the heart reading was accurate, I tested this product against a fitbit heart rate monitor. It utilizes the same technology to read pulse and heart beat. The watch reading was pretty close. It did not differ from the fitbit heart rate which is great. The sensor is pretty good but I would recommend wiping it down every so often. So the battery I would say needs to be charged every other day for me. That is because I do get a bunch of messages and I like to utilize my watch more frequently. It is not too hard to charge and takes a few hours to charge to full. Normally one overnight should be more than enough to charge it. The down side is the charger is a magnetic base and that can be a bit hard to replace in the future if you happen to need to get a replacement charger. The screen is not too easily to scratch up so I would not be too worried. The touch screen is pretty responsive which is nice. It does has the basic features I need which is to track my steps and heart rate. The app itself works relatively well and is pretty straight forward to use. It gives me my daily information. The application is required to setup. The application does not crash like many other applications do and is fairly UI friendly. It does take some time to get used to. Again the band is not bad but it does feel cheap. It is a simple silicone band and it can sometimes chafe the skin and feel bit slipper if you sweat. Overall this is a decent smartwatch to have if you are on a budget. I actually like this for how it looks and I do not care too much if it gets scratched up. I am not sure if it completely water proof and I do not intend to jump in the water with this. The battery does last at least a day. The reading for the pulse and heartbeat is pretty accurate. The watch has a nice look to it but the band is not the best. The only thing is that the charging base may be hard to replace in the future if it happens to break.",

                "reviewText": "There are so many amazing perks with this watch, I don't even know where to begin! Do not let the price of this smart watch fool you! I previously owned an Apple Watch, (very expensive) and I would recommend this smart watch over the apple watch any day!!!The first thing that I NEED to point out about this watch is how long the battery lasts!!! The first time I used the watch it lasted for 8 days, the battery lasts a long time which is soooo very convenient.The watch is extremely user-friendly and connects seamlessly to both Android and iOS devices via Bluetooth. Everything on the watch and application is super easy to set up and use. I was honestly amazed at how much I love this product. You're able to take calls, send messages, and so much more!One of my absolute favorite things about this smart watch is that it has the ability to check your oxygen levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and even better, it tracks the different stages of your sleep schedule!! (Light sleep, Deep sleep, REM, and awake)It's so fashionable, It has a large HD screen which displays crisp and clear visuals even in bright sunlight. The watch looks beautiful while wearing it, and it has a lot of free faces to choose from. The interface is very intuitive and easy to navigate.Overall, I highly recommend this Smart Watch to anyone who is especially looking for a reliable fitness tracker that doesn't compromise on style or functionality.",

It don't sync all your contacts like it should! I am able to take phone calls and make calls from the watch! I wish it had a feature to type a text from the watch! This watch works great though! The charger is a little bit tricky since the magnetic shield it has but after messing with it, I got my watch to charge! I think its neat how it tracks ovulation and menstrual periods which I got to wait for since I recently had a baby! Its nice how the watch tells you if your oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate is normal! overall good watch but needs more features for my liking! The app needs some work for the contacts to add to the watch for notifications to pop up!",

Battery doesn't even last a day a, so your step counts are never correct because you have to stop and charge it. It just STOPPED working when placed on the charger one day. Amazon could not offer a warranty page to refer to, so basically it's a waste of money as opposed to my FitBit that I had for YEARS and when that wiped out, Fitbit gave me a discount on a new one. If you work out regularly do NOT buy this product. It will only frustrate you. Spend the extra and go with an Apple Watch or FitBit. They say when you buy cheap, you buy at least 3 times and that is cedrtainly true with this product. Disappointed and a waste of 70 bucks. DONT.",

                "reviewText": "Auf den ersten Blick sieht diese Smartwatch mit Fitnesstracker sehr edel und innovativ aus und ist sehr gut und sauber verarbeitet. Das Geh\u00e4use besteht aus einer robusten und strapazierf\u00e4higen Metall-Kunststoff-Kombination. Es besteht aus robustem Silikon, hat eine robuste Schnalle und eine L\u00e4nge, die auch von Menschen getragen werden kann, die einen etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferen Gelenkumfang haben. Es ist robust, sehr gut und sauber verarbeitet und von sehr guter Qualit\u00e4t. Die Aufladung findet \u00fcber ein spezielles USB-Kabel statt. Die Kontakte werden durch eine magnetische Kopplung des Steckers am Uhrengeh\u00e4use erreicht.Beim Display handelt es sich um ein sehr gutes und hochaufl\u00f6sendes Touch-Display. Es reagiert gut und schnell und ist gut ablesbar.Der Funktionsumfang der Software ist sehr umfangreich, so wie wir uns das vorstellen. Dazu geh\u00f6rt der Herzfrequenzmonitor, Schlaf\u00fcberwachung, Schrittz\u00e4hler, Kalorienverbrauch, Sauerstoffs\u00e4ttigungsmonitor, Aktivit\u00e4ts\u00fcbersicht, Timer, Wecker, usw.Was uns jedoch besonders gef\u00e4llt ist, dass die Datenreihen sehr sch\u00f6n in Form von Grafiken bereits auf der Uhr dargestellt werden. Das ist richtig professionell umgesetzt. Wir m\u00f6chten bereits unterwegs auf der Smartwatch die einzelnen Ergebnisse auf Stundenbasis in Form einer Grafik sehen und nicht erst die Daten auf das Smartphone laden um dann erst die Ergebnisse Dargestellt zu bekommen. Bei einer professionellen Tracking-Sequenz sollte keine APP n\u00f6tig sein und das ist hier vorbildlich umgesetzt worden.Voraussetzung f\u00fcr die Nutzung und Einstellung bestimmter Stammdaten ist die Installation der APP auf dem Smartphone. Die APP m\u00f6chte einige Freigaben am Smartphone haben, dies betrifft die Kommunikation mit der Uhr. Das ist f\u00fcr uns soweit ok. Auch das ist vorbildlich. Man braucht auch nicht immer ein Smartphone mit der APP, um diese Smartwatch mit Fitnesstracker betreiben zu k\u00f6nnen. Die Verbindung zwischen dem Trecker und dem Smartphone findet \u00fcber Bluetooth statt. Wir nutzen Fitnesstracker sehr gerne, um umfangreiche Bio-Funktionen abzufragen und zu messen und danach unsere sportlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten auszurichten. Wir nutzen ihn beim Walken, Joggen, Wandern, Radfahren und w\u00e4hrend der t\u00e4glichen Arbeit.Die Blutdruckwerte sind mit Vorsicht zu sehen, denn gegen die Genauigkeit eines Armblutdruckmessger\u00e4tes kommen sie nicht an. Beispiel: Blutdruckwert auf Oberarm-Messger\u00e4t 168/89 auf dem Tracker zur fast gleichen Zeit 106/74 mmHg. Diese Werte sind nicht brauchbar. Das ist bei anderen Trackern aber \u00e4hnlich.F\u00fcr diejenigen die 30-40 Minuten Power-Napping am Nachmittag machen sei gesagt, dass der Tracker bzw. der Sleeptimer diese Phasen nicht gut erkennt, sodass die Schlaftiefe und eine eventuelle REM-Phase beim Power-Napping nicht angezeigt werden. Der Sleeptimer arbeitet nachts hingegen sehr gut und ist f\u00fcr uns sehr wichtig. Hier sieht man sogar sehr deutlich, wie sich Umgebungsl\u00e4rm auf den Tiefschlaf auswirkt. Die REM-Phasen werden permanent unterbrochen, eventuell Ohrst\u00f6psel einsetzen.Die ganzheitliche Visualisierung in der APP ist gut, unerl\u00e4sslich, sinnvoll und interessant. Sie l\u00e4uft auf unserem Samsung S23 Ultra problemlos. Auch die Bluetooth Verbindung funktionierte nach der Installation der APP sofort.Die Bedienungsanleitung ist in Wort und Bild verfasst und liegt bei.Die Smartwatch, die gleichzeitig ein Fitnesstracker ist, ist von der Software her sehr gut aufgestellt. Sie ist ein interessantes, sehr gut verarbeitetes und n\u00fctzliches Produkt, welches wir t\u00e4glich gerne nutzen, weil wir zus\u00e4tzlich auch die Tagesaktivit\u00e4t sehen.",
