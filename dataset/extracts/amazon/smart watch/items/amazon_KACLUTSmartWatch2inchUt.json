                "reviewText": "Often I miss an important call or text, my 12yo daughter said to get a smart watch. Knowing how hard I am on them, she found this one. After looking and comparing it with others, I ordered it.The pros are it is waterproof and rugged. Allows me to read just a small part of received text messages, send or receive calls, \u00e0nd some minimum health monitoring functions. Long lasting battery with in my case, over 18 days on one full charge.Has a few cons, definitely limited to design ypur own watch face as it allows the time and date placed over your pic. Preset colors, font and placement makes it difficult to fully design your own watch face. The preinstalled offerings are generic and with no options to down load any programs to add new ones.Although for the price it has few user functions and the ones it does have are fairly also generic to other smart watches. You cannot text from the watch or see the entire text message.For me, the only advantage of this smart watch is to alert me to calls or received text messages without having to pull out my phone constantly.The app you download to use the few options you can control, is sluggish but effective. You have to connect with the app to sync it to the watch, and the weather only syncs around every hour or so. Definitely not any real time sync other than the time.It would have received only 3\u2606, but because it did stay waterproof when I swim and rugged enough to withstand my daily wear, I gave it 4\u2606. Overall, not the best and certainly not the worse, just make sure and read what it will or will not do before purchasing, and your wants in a smart watch.",

Will not light the screen at all. Contacted Amazon and they gave me an online contact point for the seller. Filled out the form and never heard back from them. Checked spam folder regularly for about 10 days. They didn't care enough to even say your screwed. You probably will love this watch until it does the same thing to you. I just don't get it, why go through all the work to get reviews and make a product people want and then destroy your credibility like that?Are we all just that gullible?Bought a different Brand watch from another seller.",

                "reviewText": "I will start by saying this is the second watch. The first Identical watch was bad. When charging, the battery got so hot, you could not hold the watch. The caused the display to go out. I had it replaced with the same watch, due to all the good reviews.Second/ current smart watch as been working flawlessly for several months now. The battery live, with the way I have it set, continuously monitoring all heart rate, blood oxygen, your workouts, sleep, and even the other things it connect to on your phone, such as your calendar, text messages, phone calls, etc. The battery is lasting a long time with everything active on the watch. I charged it when I got it, here 9 weeks later, the battery is showing at 50%. So extremely long battery life.Some of the other things I like about this watch is 1) the large watch face, 2) You have many different watches to chose from, so you get to select the watch face that YOU want. 3) The app allows you to share your health data with other apps. I have to use Go365\ud83d\ude12. It does not directly connect with Go365 (that is a Go365 issue). To get around this issue, it easily connects and shares your health data with Samsung Health, which does talk to Go365. Problem solved. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d my steps are getting to Go365, maybe not directly, but this smart watches app does talk to/ shares data with other health related apps.I really like the watch and do recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Pro:-Inexpensive-2 days battery life-its not super ugly.Cons:-The BP is so off the mark as to be comical.-The supposed app to obtain other faces cant be found. Others clearly have it, but it does not seem to exist anywhere I can find it.-The \"registration\" form to register the device asks for credit card info and support was clearly not able to handle this accurately. The support appears non-existent and sorely lacking.-No way to answer texts even with a canned message.-The sound is thin and tinny (its a watch, what can you really expect?)This is an okay watch if you are looking for something very basic that can handle calls and only text notifications and calls. You can probably find better at this same price range but you can for sure find cheaper that does the same.The real shame is that when the registration form asked for credit card info to register the device, I reached out to support which appears the only way to do so is to ask questions here. That was not as bad as the answer I got on that issue- reset the watch..... to correct a form on a webpage asking for credit card info? I dont think so.I have to suggest you stay away from this one. It was a mistake to purchase this.",

They have been more than willing to make this right. They\u2019ve been professional and courteous the entire time.I understand that things like this happen.Since the issue, I\u2019ve been in contact with the company and they\u2019ve handled the corrective actions very satisfactorily. Thank you.For added context my original review is below.I bought this watch in Jun to more accurately track my steps. My phone was only so good. I loved that feature of it. The other whistles and bells were ok but I really just wanted it for my steps. Recently my family and I went to the Dominican for vacation. After about 30 minutes in a 5-foot pool, the watch started to act funny. The screen was all over the place. Obviously, it got wet. I dried it with rice, but it never came back. It will not even charge.",
