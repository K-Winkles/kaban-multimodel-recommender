The watch face was bright, and the heft was nice on the arm.The watch did not feel too plasticky. We tested out the water resistance on the watch, and it survived the test without any issues.The screen is nice and bright and can be used outdoors. The watch is responsive enough to use day to day. The watch comes with some apps preinstalled that can be fairly useful like sleep tracking and even a remote control for your cell phone's camera.",
