The app is pretty straight forward and works well. BT connection is very stable and range is as expected. The large face makes it easy to read. Phone feature works well with clear reception on both ends. Battery life has been good so far. The gold band is quite elegant. I would recommend.",

After suffering a recent stroke, I had been searcing for a smart watch that would easily keep track of health data, especially during sleep. This watch is an upgrade from my traditional watch because it has several face options, includes apps, data, and adds notifications to your wrist. I can even use it to answer my phone. Also, I use it to track my activities (Exercising, Road cycling, dancing), and enjoy looking at the data it provides. It tracks my steps, and heart rate blood presssure and so much more! Although it took me a while to figure out the features of this watch, I must say that it is a great deal for the price. And with this watch I not only have style, I have a watch that \"puts the future of health\" on my wrist.",

It looks like an Apple watch, has a lot of the same features as one as well. It definitely doesn't run as smoothly as one though. It's slower, clumsier and the icons aren't as finished looking as a true Apple watch, but man...it's pretty good for what it is. It does sleep tracking, text, the talk feature is good and clear on both ends, it has deep breathe, monitors heart rate, and does the EKG, you can change watch faces and the layout of the apps, and there are a ton more features. I'm Impressed. She's one of the boujiest 10y/o's I know and she loves this thing. Shes a Tiffany's diamond working on a pawn shop budget, kind of girl. The fact that she likes it sells it for me. I would definitely buy it again.",

I dove into Amazon and researched the others and realized he chose the perfect smart watch for me. I use so many of the health features everyday, BP, step tracker, sleep tracker. Phone calls are clear. I can choose a personal display. The only issue I have may be due to how I have it's defaults, but the display changes faces switch at will. I like to keep the flower display. I like that other straps are available. It fun to change to different color straps. I also bought the screen saver to keep the face protected.",

THE FUNCTIONALITY IS MEDIOCRE, ALMOST GENERIC TO ALL SMARTWATCHES THAT ARE NOT APPLE, FITBIT, ETC.THE MOBILE APP IS LACKING IN WHAT IT CAN CONTROL ON THE WATCH ITSELF AND IS NOT VERY USER-FRIENDLY.THE WATCH ITSELF HAS TWO NICE FEATURES BEIGN THE MAIN CONTROL (CROW) AND THE CUSTOMIZABLE BUTTON BELOW IT. MAKES IT EASIER TO NAVIGATE AROUND WITHOUT HAVING TO ALWAYS REVERT BACK TO THE WATCHFACETHE WIDE VARITY WATCHFACES IS NICE.. AND THEY ARE MORE INTRICATE THAN OTHER SMARTWATCHES I'VE EXPLORED.THE ONE MAIN CAVEAT THAT MAKES THIS WATCD DESERVE 3 STARS IS THAT THE \"VIEWING \" OF SMS IS JUST THAT; IT IS A \"PREVIEW\" AND DOES NOT DISPLAY THE ENTIRE MESSAGE.THERE ARE OTHER SMARTWATCHES OUT THERE THAT HAVE AT LEAST 3X THE CHARACTER LIMIT; IN THIS PARTICULAR ASPECCT, THIS WATCH IS DEFINITELY SUB-PAR. THE LACK OF THIS FEATURE RENDERS THE WATCH USELESS IN TERMS OF SMS AND NOTIFICATIONS BECAUSE YOU IMMINENTLY HAVE TO PICK UP YOUR PHONE TO DISPLAY THE FULL MESSAGE. THIS WAS MY MAIN FOCUS FOR USING A SMARTWATCH BUT AGAIN, IT DOES NOT PERFORM TO ITS EXPECTATIONS.OVERALL, THE WATCH IS OK... VERY GENERIC TO OTHER SMART WATCHES, AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY FEATURES THAT MAKE THIS WATCH BETTER THAN THE NEXT.HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPED YOU MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PURCHASE THIS WATCH.",

Utilisation tr\u00e8s intuitive pour passer d'un \u00e9cran \u00e0 un autre, pour param\u00e9trer la montre... On a tout de suite acc\u00e8s aux informations courantes : surveiller son rythme cardiaque (le jour, pendant le sommeil), son nombre de pas, les calories perdues... Et il existe un grand nombre d'autres modes que nous n'avons pas encore explor\u00e9s. La montre est livr\u00e9e avec 2 bracelets facilement interchangeables et tr\u00e8s jolis. Un excellent choix avec un tr\u00e8s bon rapport qualit\u00e9/prix. Je la recommande vivement.",

Mutter hat sich sehr \u00fcber das Geschenk gefreut, sie hat es schnell mit der Bedienung zurechtgefunden.Der einzige Nachteil ist der Verschluss am Armband, wenn er sich an etwas verf\u00e4ngt, besteht die M\u00f6glichkeit, das er aufgeht und Uhr f\u00e4llt von Hangelenk ab. Wir haben es bei einer Rabattaktion gekauft, Preis Leistung super.",

Der Tracker l\u00e4sst sich leicht bedienen.Er hat viele Anwendungsbereiche.Unteranderem Messung der Herzfrequenz,Messung des Schlafes und vieles mehr.Aber besondere beeindruckend finde ich,dass sie auch die K\u00f6rpertemperatur misst.Das mitgelieferte Ladeger\u00e4t ist perfekt. Der Tracker wird nur in die passende Position eingeklemmt und schon wird geladen.Somit wird auch das runterfallen des Tickets verhindert.Preis-Leistung geht zu 100%durch.",
