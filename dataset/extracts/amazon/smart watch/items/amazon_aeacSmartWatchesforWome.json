Even though it cost much less than others it was simple to install, pair and works well. I was surprised that it was delivered a day after I ordered. No with on its second day it continues to impress me and delivered all that was in the description. Definitely a good buy and good value for the price.",

Immediately I cancelled the transacci\u00f3n, but a QR with the watch model and a Mac 8728 apear and I cannot continue since I have an android. There's no telephone number or customer service link that I can use to get ride of this QR and I cannot return it because the application contains my personal info. Any suggestions????",

                "reviewText": "This smartwatch arrived in a small box and was well packaged. With the watch, you get a USB charging cable, an actual helpful user manual, and a warranty card.This is a nice-looking watch. It comes with a large 1.45\u201d round display and the watch metal is gold. The band is pink. It looks very elegant. The band is a silicon type material and feels comfortable on the wrist. It will be easy to clean.Here is a complete list of functions of this watch:1- Information reminder, texts, email etc.2- Bluetooth calling/answering phone calls.3- Step counting, distance walked, calories.4- Heart Rate.5- Blood oxygen level.6- 14 Sport Modes.7- Breathing Exercise app.8- Sleep monitoring data.9- Alarm Clock.10- Weather Screen.11- Music Control.12- Remote Photo taking from phone.13- Timer.14- Stopwatch15- Settings.Although this smartwatch doesn\u2019t have a Blood Pressure monitor, no big deal as so many watches that have it are not accurate anyway.This watch is very easy to setup and use. You can simply scan the QR code on the front of the user guide and it will bring you to the Google Play Store to download the OnWearPro App. Pairing took about 10 seconds.To use the watch:1- Swipe to the right to enter the phone call functions.2- Swipe to the left to enter daily activities and other screens.3- Swipe down to access quick menus.4- Swipe up to access messages or notifications.The watch works well; it feels comfortable on the arm. Response from touch is good. The calling function worked as it should. The audio was clear and loud enough. It worked flawlessly and I wasn\u2019t that close to my phone. The heart rate monitor is a good guide and is close to what it should be. I have a blood pressure monitor machine and its close. Perhaps reading from the wrist will read different from the arm. The battery is good; it lasts for about 3-4 days of moderate to heavy use.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this watch. It checks all the boxes for a smartwatch to help you keep track of some health data and at the same time gives you a decent experience with convenience to be able to access your notifications and make and receive calls. For the money, it is a good value.",

                "reviewText": "The Smart watch arrived in a small white box; just over 6\" (15.5cm). Comes with the battery charging cable which is about 2 ft long (60cm). Not bad; would be nice if it was longer. I charged it up immediately upon opening the box as recommended by the manufacturer and stated in the included instruction manual. The box also contains a warranty card with a QR code to help you navigate to register the product. The watch looks elegant and feels comfortable on the wrist. I have a medium to large wrist and the watch face looks good; not too big/not small at all. The band is well adjustable and has 1 strap loop to hold the band together. I found the instructions in the manual easy to use; simply scan the QR code to begin. It brought me to the Play Store where I downloaded the app. (OnWearPro) I like the look and features on the default watch face. It shows the digital and analog time, month and day, battery level, heart rate, steps, and calories. As shown in the pictures, you simply swipe from right to left to navigate through the watch features. I did setup notifications for texts and it works well. I disabled Email notifications as it gets annoying after a while with too many emails. The weather report screen is accurate and picked up right away. The app is OK; I found that sometimes the watch won't show weather or messages until I open the app again on the phone. I guess this is setup this way so both the app and phone are syncing. There are a lot of watch faces to choose from but honestly; I haven't seen one I like better than the default watch face. You can choose however a custom watch face and import pictures of your own. This is a cool feature. I've been using the watch now for about 4 days; still have 56% battery life. This is satisfactory and its better than what I expected; I have been playing with it quite a bit learning how to use. I also tried making a phone call with it; it worked well; called without a glitch and sound was audibly comfortable. Overall; I'm pleasantly pleased with this watch; it appears to be well made and crafted. I'm not demanding for any sport/workout features so it has everything I want in a smartwatch and feel its a good value for the money.",
