                "reviewText": "I purchased this watch with the intent of gifting it to my girlfriend for her birthday. I have not yet given it to her, but I know I don\u2019t have to to know she will be impressed.Garmin watches are top quality, and well worth the buy. I myself own a Garmin F\u00e9nix 5x, and love it. I\u2019ve never owned a more technologically advanced, durable, long lasting watch. This Vivoactive 3 is a bit different from mine, but it still has a multitude of amazing features, that might even beat mine!The watch is beautifully crafted, and can be worn on all occasions. Whether it be at the gym, at the beach, or even at an extravagant event. It\u2019s design is meant to be casual, but with that little extra flare that makes people say \u201cwow, nice watch!\u201d.Like I said before it has a multitude of features, that are extremely convenient, and you will end up appreciating more than you know later on. If you\u2019re an active person, being able to track your runs, trace routes, see how many strokes it takes on a paddle board to get you 100 meters, and more, makes working out even better than before. It helps you retain your progress, and strive to to better. It promotes over all better body health. It tracks your steps, heartbeat, and more, which helps you keep note on your activity, and helps remind you to go and get out there if you\u2019re not meeting your goals.Also, besides all of the neat sports features, it\u2019s extremely tech! I used to laugh at people with Apple watches because they constantly checked their wrists for texts, but now that I own a smart watch, I completely understand! (Btw I\u2019m not comparing these to apple watches, because Garmin blows them out of the water, but well get to that in the next paragraph.) it\u2019s extremely continent to be able to have your phone somewhere else, and be able to quickly check texts or answer calls. Not only that, but have you ever been in the middle of a good workout, and a song you don\u2019t like comes on, and you have to get up to change the song on your phone? Well you can do that from your watch without moving. Like I said, you\u2019ll appreciate this watch way more than you know.Now, when it comes to competing brands, garmin in for the Win. If you have an IPhone, no need to fear, Garmin is 100% compatible. Not to hate on Apple watches, but don\u2019t buy an apple watch just because you have an iPhone, and for a few reasons. First being that Apple doesn\u2019t have the extensive list of features garmin does. Secondly, apple watches die after 3 days, and take almost a whole night to charge. I can wear my garmin for a week and some change, then charge it in an hour and a half. It\u2019s insane. And finally, apple watches just don\u2019t have that extra pop that Garmins do. The square body shape doesn\u2019t compare to the look a garmin gives off. Garmin watches are almost like ford raptors. Yeah it\u2019s a truck and you can work in it and get it dirty, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a $100k truck that\u2019s built for racing.All in all, I think Garmin Watches are top notch, and there\u2019s nothing else like them. It\u2019s well worth the buy, and you won\u2019t regret it.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE July 14, 2020 - I have been wearing this watch almost every day for almost 2 years and I like it very much. (I had forgotten that I hadn't liked this watch, so am updating this review. See my previous reviews below for what my problems were at the time.) In the end, I was able to convince Garmin Support to send me a new watch instead of a refurb. I think I had to pay for shipping or something. The new watch has not had any of the step tracking issues the prior watch had. Nor any of the synching issues. I think the O/S update did in fact solve the synching problems. (I'm an Android user, for reference.)I use the Strava synch all the time and it works great. Every now and then there's a delay for the watch to synch its data to the Garmin app on the phone, but as soon as it's on the phone it posts to Strava. I primarily use this watch to track cycling activities, but have also used it for running, hiking, swimming, skiing stand-up paddle, and some others.It's been quite durable as well. I did buy a tempered glass screen protector, which now has a chip in it, but the watch itself has taken something of a beating.The waterproofing works as well. I basically never take it off. Always shower with it. Swim with it, etc.Sleep tracking has been good.HR has seemed accurate to me.Battery life has been excellent. I go about a week between charges when I'm not using the activity tracking feature. This is great. I really don't worry about the battery. When I am going to go cycling, I charge it up fully and then I can get about 8-9 hours of tracking. If you want to use it mainly for tracking runs and you run for less than an hour every other day, you could probably charge it only once every five days. When I do charge it, it will go from 20% to full in about half an hour or forty-five minutes, so even when I wake up to go cycling and realize I forgot to charge it I can just do it then while I'm getting the gear ready.Two years have passed since I bought it and I had expected that there'd be a better watch out now that was a Wear O/S watch with LTE capabilities (which is the only thing this watch lacks, IMO, b/c I\"d love to be able to leave the phone at home), but there isn't. If this watch broke today, I'd just buy another one. For the current price, it's a steal.------------------UPDATE Nov 15, 2018 - I can't recommend this watch. More and more problems are occurring. The first problem is that it stopped tracking any floors on the stair counter. This happened after I took a trip on an airplane and other posters had mentioned that maybe their altimeter (barometer) broke in conjunction with a plane trip. I called Garmin Support and they discussed this and they said that maybe and update to the O/S from 5.4 to 5.5 (which was due any day) would help, and/or they'd be happy to send me a new watch and if i wanted even faster they would send it immediately if I'd pay a deposit which they would refund when I got the new watch. I said, okay, well, I'll wait til 5.5 comes out and see and the maybe return it and they said that was all fine.So, I waited, it didn't fix it, and I contacted them to do the exchange, and they sent me a form for payment and I see that the watch they intend to give me is refurbished. They did not specify this earlier. I'm annoyed b/c at the time I was still in my 30 day return window and could have just returned it and bought another new one.Additionally, since that time, other problems have occurred:--synching has become a real problem. The watch just sometimes will go days without synching to the phone app. Also, the app seems to be built in some stupid way where it needs Internet connectivity in order to sync the watch. So, forget synching if you're traveling to some country where you only receive 2g, or are otherwise in an are with poor signal.--Relatedly, I discovered while in the middle of the Costa Rican rainforest, is that even the GPX maps that I had loaded to the Garmin Connect app cannot be displayed without an Internet connection. Seriously, Garmin?!?!? You are making fitness devices for people to use out in the wild, and yet they can't even access their loaded routes in your app without an Internet connection?--the heart rate monitor seems to have gotten much less reliable. Often it sits at 90 when I'm clearly in aerobic or anaerobic range (130+)--I have noticed... why is there no Timer app on this watch? So simple. Why didn't they include it. Or an Alarm feature.---my original review from Oct 2018-----I have had this watch for a couple of weeks and have been very happy with it. I had tried the Amazfit Bip and Ticwatch E and both failed to accurately track my heart rate when going over about 130bpm. No watch is as good as a band yet for that, but those were so obviously wrong doing things like showing 80 when I was huffing and puffing. The Garmin Vivoactive 3 seems accurate enough for my purposes.The battery life is acceptable/good. You can get multiple days unless you are tracking long activities. If you are running GPS and doing long cycling rides (4-8 hours) like I am, you will not get more than one ride per charge. I suppose this is asking a lot of the battery.The problem I am having is that already the stair step counter has stopped working. It worked for awhile but now has just stopped. Not sure if that is a common problem. Have tried to contact the seller but there doesn't seem to be any way to do that here. May have to return it for a replacement if I don't hear something back from them based on this post.",

I'd recommend to anyone.Only function that doesn't work I'd Garmin Pay as it's not avaialbe in Canada yet. Also not as many face watch selections as I thought. However it has a cool watch face feature where you can upload a background photo for you watch face (from your camera)! So cool.It has 30 programmable text back responses when your phone isn't accessible. There's many settings to play with on watch itself including brightness which was one review I read. It goes brighter than you need but sucks battery more.Battery needs changing every few days I find but charges extremely fast. Within 30-60 mins.Heart rate seems to be super accurate as is GPS!Can't wait to swim with this on the summer! Love it! Five Star \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",
