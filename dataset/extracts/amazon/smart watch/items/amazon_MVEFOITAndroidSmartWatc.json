                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have to say I did too much research \ud83d\ude02. This watch is a very nice watch. You see the side by side comparison with my Fitbit, which is giving me fits after a year and a half.Pros:For the price you can't go wrong with this watch. It is elegant and light on the waist. It does a whole lot more than my Fitbit. For fitness this is great. Movement reminders, drink water reminders, activity tracker, heart rate, and oxygen levels. It is awesome. (Remember it is not a medical device and not meant to be used as such.) Its activity tracker has many types of activities to track, unlike Fitbit, which only has a few and is supposed to be a activity tracker.It also has a ton of clock faces or you can personalize with your own pictures. Nice feature.I have used the phone feature which worked great. Now when I am not in my car, which connects to my phone, I can answer the phone without having to dig it out of my pocket or purse. Nice and in a reasonably inexpensive watch.It does have 24 hour service on the app, which I have used to ask questions. They answered in a timely fashion.Also, the player feature worked well, as it can control the player in your phone and you can listen while you exercise without having to have your phone out. The shutter worked well for controlling the camera on the phone. It is a nice feature for my selfies or group pics I want to be in.Cons:The first one is the app, as stated in other reviews it is glitchy. It may come on when needed or not. It sometimes will not keep the settings you want as in metric or imperial measures. I keep that monitored. They really do need to work on that with such a nice watch.Also, sleep function cannot be turn to any other time. It is 10-8. If you work third shifts or even second shifts you will not be able to track your sleep. If not important this is not a deal breaker.I will update if I find anything else I like or dislike. Also on the longevity of the watch. I am looking forward to using this watch over my other one.UPDATE:The battery life is as long as my Versa ever was. Depending if I leave the phone on on my watch, it will last about 3 days. If I turn off the phone and turn on battery saver (nice feature) it can last 4-6 days. Honestly this is not a problem I plug my phone in every night and I don't wear the watch 24/7. As mentioned in another review every once in a while the app gets glitchy. Hopefully they will fix that with updates. Only happened a couple of times.I love this watch! I am buying one for my husband for Christmas. The watch band fits him! He has big wrists! \ud83d\ude02Update: The only issues I have had with the watch is it will switch screens easily while wearing. I may be wearing it too close to my hand. The other thing I have encountered is the time being off. I had to re-pair the watch. This is an app thing. It only happened once while traveling. I do not consider these to be something that would keep me from buying the watch. As a matter of fact I did get one for my husband. If it lasts a year it will have lasted longer than my Fitbit. Worth it to me. Not spending a fortune either.",

It's really easy to use all you need is the app on your phone it's easy to set up and sync.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent quality watch. Keeps accurate track of my steps and walking, I can make and receive my phone calls on it, and I can even receive text my text messages on it.There is so much more on this smart watch that I\u2019m still learning\u2026. Such as sleep and calming meditative breathing. Plenty of watch faces to choose from. But what is really important to me is that I was able to receive IMMEDIATE personal help twice tonight and she was patient and completely resolved my issues.",

                "reviewText": "I got this watch after looking at others and compared to the expensive brand names this one is actually money worth spent. It does take and make calls, you can also read all your incoming messages, but you can't text back, but with most it's pretty standard. I love the heart rate high warning. I also love the tracking ability and also love how easy it was to set up and connect. Compared to others I highly suggest this one. It does the basics you need at an affordable cost",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars A little misleading",
                "reviewText": "This is not a Smart Watch that you would talk through or reply to texts with. Basically, all the call/text/a.i. features do is wake your phone. Not sure there is even a microphone in this thing. Incoming calls light up the watch and if you press the answer button, it just opens your phone. You can dial a number out on the watch but touching the \"call\" button just opens the phone to make the call. The A.I. \"assist to reply to text messages\" button only opens the voice assist on your phone.This is to be expected with the low price.However, more basic functions are lacking. Alarms can only be set in the app, are vibration only, limited to 3 and the slightest movement of the watch turns it off - which is not very useful if you are wearing this alarm to wake from sleep. No calculator. Camera shutter will not work with all phones. Music player control will not pull titles or thumbnails from phone. No sound customization, hardly any sound at all. The \"Find my device\" alert is quiet.The only positive I have for this watch is that it has many more face options available for free through the app compared to the other 3 I bought for the same price.This watch is cluttered with useless features and even less useful without the app handy. It works well as a light-up digital watch but that's about it.",
