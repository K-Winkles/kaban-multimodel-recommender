It keeps turning on phone mode when we don't want to use it, forcing us to turn off Bluetooth. 3. A small jolt on the knob changes the watch face when we don't want it to. I wish there was an option to lock the watch face. When you try to activate the google assistance from the watch, you have to have the phone out of your pocket in order to speak to the Google Assistance, defeats the purpose. It's like it doesn't use the watch mic only the phone mic. Those are the 4 main issues we have with this watch. We love the brand as we had 2 of same brand, but this specific model doesn't work the greatest. If they can have an update for this watch to fix these 4 issues it would be the best watch for your money. I wear mine because of the cool features. I've learned to adjust to the 4 issues this watch lacks and annoys us. One of the features I liked, the watch knows I answer via phone so speaker and mic on phone is what it goes to instead of the watch. If I answer via watch, it activates the watch speaker and mic. However, it has to switch back and forth from watch to phone to figure it out, probably the bug from number 2 I stated above. Please fix the 4 issues. Besides those 4 issues, the watch is pretty cool.",
