                "reviewText": "This watch replaces a Pebble Steel that has been in use since 2016. After six years the battery in the Pebble Steel is waning. The main features I was looking for were similar water resistance, at least one week of battery life and phone media control. As for the later, the Moto 100 only provides media controls for play/pause, previous and next. The Moto Watch does not show active media from the connected mobile device. The Pebble Steel does the later as well as providing volume control. The Amazon listing for the Moto 100 says it will skip tracks or turn up the volume without needing easy access to your phone. This statement is inaccurate.The aluminum case and overall build quality appear quite nice. The battery life is about one week and it charges in about an hour.The PulseOx measurement system is inaccurate in a hypoxemia situation [holding your breath; pulse ox <= 90 %] when the watch reading is compared to a conventional finger style pulse ox device. The Wyze Watch 47 watch has the same deficiency.Here are several other noteworthy items.The magnetic coupling of the charging cable to the watch should be stronger. The cable easily becomes detached if the watch is moved. The cable will not stay connected under its own weight.Unlike the Pebble Steel, the stopwatch will quit timing if one leaves the screen to do something else. The same holds true for the timers.The 10 second duration of the vibration related to the alarm functionality isn\u2019t long enough to wake me up.The short, usually one word or partial word notifications, for example from emails, provided on large LCD touch screen isn\u2019t detailed enough to be readily identifiable.After six weeks of use, the lights associated with the heart rate and PulseOx measurements quit. As a result, the related dynamic health functions fail to work. The next day the watch failed completely and no longer powers up. The product has a two-year warranty. See the photo for the likely culprit.The Motowatch support team requests numerous \u201cquick\u201d videos related to the watch functionality when simple photos suffice. There is nothing quick about the process of sending a 25 MB, 10 second video, [link] via email! The support team should be more considerate of the customers\u2019 time.After more than a week of answering emails from Motowatch and providing needless videos, the watch was replaced by eBuyNow LTD. The replacement lacks any ability to control media playback on the connected smartphone. It\u2019s also worth noting that the magnetic attraction between the charging cable and the watch is much better on the replacement compared to the watch originally received. It\u2019s unclear why there is such variability between presumably identical products.I ultimately received a RMA and returned the product. It took weeks and additional emails before I finally received the promised refund from eBuyNow LTD via PayPal. During this process, eBuyNow LTD customer support claimed more than once being overwhelmed with \u201clogistical problems\u201d. Overall, this entire experience with the seller was very frustrating and time consuming.I went on to purchase an Amazefit GTR 3 Pro LTD which has an OS like the Moto 100, only far better implemented. Except for the PulseOx accuracy, it has none of the faults noted here of the Moto 100.",

It takes too much battery and memory on my phone. I would prefer the ability to do more of the phone features on it. I wanted one with a name brand and type to be able to order accessories for it. The app reviews said it didn't work. Maybe it doesn't on other types of phones. I don't like that the app is only sports stuff and not phone things but the app works as far as I can tell since I don't use those things. I am curious if Motorola will be coming out with a new smartwatch to go with the better phones they are coming out with. Maybe one with less of the sports things",

I have pointed out that the product is defective in that it looses the Bluetooth connection to a Moto phone, but they refuse to refund my purchase price.DO NOT BUY ONE!!!!!Bought one of these to use the fall monitoring for an elderly relative. The thing kept loosing the connection to the Bluetooth on a Motorola phone that it was never more than a few feet away from. Customer support for both the watch and the extra cost monitoring service was very bad.Minimum of 4 day turn around on questions, and usually their answer was something like \"Ask the fall monitoring people\" if it was Moto and \"ask Moto\" if it was the fall monitoring people.Probably because it was loosing the Bluetooth connection the battery life was only a few days. This device is not reliable enough to use as a life safety device, and it is too expensive for a cheap watch. And to top it off, it is completely unsupported for all practical purposes.My question for the monitoring folks and for Moto was \"how do I get the system to make an audible alert on my phone when there is a fall. Their answers were wrong at first, and when I showed them that their answer was wrong, they pretty much went away. This describes both Moto and the monitoring service.",

En cuanto a la duracion de la bateria, si lo tienes todo el dia midiendo la presion y la saturacion, se acaba la pila enseguida. Yo solo lo tengo vinculado al telefono y me dura una semana, a eso yo le llamo uso minimo es decir solo recibo las notificaciones del telefono y de vez en cuando la miro hora. Mido la presion y saturacion cuando termine de correr. Tengo una semana con el y estoy contento con el producto. de calidad se siente resistente, quizas las correas vayan a durar poco, pero culquier correa de platico te dura mas bien poco. Solo tengo una queja con la presicion de la lectura de la saturacion: da lecturas superiores a las que me ha dado un oximentro en el dedo al mismo tiempo, habra que tomarlo en cuenta.Al final es un producto economico de bajas prestaciones pero cumple con su cometido. Yo lo compre para iniciar en el mundo del smartwatch y ver que tan funcional puede ser. Quizas mas adelante adquiera uno superior, pero por el momento este me ha gustado. Lo puedo recomendar para principiantes en el uso del smartwatch.Te ayuda a dejar de mirar el telefono a cada momento.",

The battery is good and the screen is off and it is hard to turn it on, you have to push on the top bottom. Moving your wrist is not working well. I liked the interface though and it did very well with the SP O2 and the Heart monitor works well too. It did well with the GPS and my run and stationary rowing machine. After 3 days the watch was not paired properly with the Moto Software. I de installed and re installed it 3 times. Then the software recommended an update and after that update the watch does not work at all. Sad, it is now a piece of beautiful junk which I am returning. I thought that a Motorolla/Lenovo product would work well within a Motorolla phone/product, it has not",
