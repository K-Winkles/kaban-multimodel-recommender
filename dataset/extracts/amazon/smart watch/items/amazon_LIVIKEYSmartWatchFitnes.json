                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Video comment: the screen works well to touchon your wrist. The beginning of the video I only struggled because it was on a table.Overall though for the price you pay this is an excellent watch. It has all the functions of a Fitbit even if all of them aren't the best. It's a million times cheaper than a Fitbit though, so it's great if like me, you don't like that higher price tag commitment.a couple of cons I have noticed:1. The sleep tracker is wholey inaccurate. I think it just cycles the light and sleep back and forth. It doesn't register your waking, it says I never wake up when I very much wake up to turn off my husband's 9 alarms every morning.2. The heart rate monitor doesn't seem to cycle super often, I will feel my HR high and it will say I'm at 80, I'll manually force it and it will jump up. It does well when you schedule a workout though.3. The app could definitely use some finagling as some of it seems hard to interpret but overall does what it is meant to.4. The connection goes in and out so the find your phone feature only works... Sometimes.All this to say if that's the worst part about it.. this watch is pretty awesome. As long as those two items aren't something you're trying really hard to keep an eye on them this will get you good.",

                "reviewText": "I usually hate leaving reviews for anything, but this one warranted a five-star review, so I had to leave one. All I can say is that this thing still has not needed to be recharged and I've had it going on 10 days already and it's still at 64% charged. It is super easy to use, and I'm not a techy genius by any stretch of the imagination. Simple Bluetooth connection to my iPhone to read and compare data on an app (free) that I downloaded for that purpose. It tracks calories burned, steps taken, distance walked and daily activity times, continuous heart rate monitoring option, hours slept (deep sleep, light sleep, and awake times), blood oxygen levels, option to remind me to drink water every hour (or up to every 4 hours), tracks my phone so I can hear it ring when I misplace it, option to remind me to move my butt every hour (or up to every 4 hours), optional heart rate warning, take photo with my phone by shaking the watch, personalize with pretty much any photo and a variety of pre-loaded watch faces through the app, receive texts (cannot reply), vibrates when my phone rings (cannot answer phone through watch), AND it is completely waterproof. I showered with it a few times and I've had no issues with it getting wet. The only thing that I would change if I could would be adding the weather app, but with all the functionality it currently has, I'm not complaining. I don't check the weather often anyway, but it still would be nice to have that feature.",

My hubby and I were spending too much on fitness watches and they only worked for a year or two until the watch's phone software was updated so that the watch was considered too old (too low tech) for the software. So we bought plain Timex watches last year. The Timex watches were simple and lasted a little longer, but we missed the fitness watch bells and whistles. So, onto this watch. Very reasonably priced with all the features of a fitbit. What a great watch this is, with all the nice features we like! The personalized watch dial faces are really nice. The step counter seems accurate. The sleep record is even pretty good. And for the price, it's remarkable. I don't know how long the watch will last, and I wish the battery power lasted longer, but at just over $20, this was a really great purchase.",
