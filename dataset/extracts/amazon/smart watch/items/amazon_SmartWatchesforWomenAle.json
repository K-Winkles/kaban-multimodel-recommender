I messaged customer service and within 24 hours the responded with the ASIN so I could purchase another one, and it was reasonably priced. The software is OK...I have one other smart watch to compare it to and I like that software better. But this certainly does the job. Keeps track of everything I want, lets me know when I've hit milestones and goals. They have a wide variety of different faces available on the store to customize it and I've always been able to find a free one I'm happy with (though they do have some cool ones that you can pay for). On the down side the watch answers the phone when I don't want it to and has even called back wrong numbers twice when I wasn't trying to place a call (and I had calls disabled at the time). Lastly it took a fall from the bathroom counter to the tile floor and the screen can no longer show black. The face is a kind of retro-70's brown...Not ideal but also not a deal breaker. I still wear it every day.",

                "reviewText": "I really needed a watch that would be accurate and hopefully provide me with a few features I need because I work as a docent in a museum so I needed a way to keep track of my tours so I know how much time I have for each one. This watch has not left my wrist since I got it because it more than exceeds my expectations! The different designs for the watch face are really cool and I love that I can control my music from this, as well as my Alexa, and I can also monitor my sleep and my cardio. There are a few features that don't seem to sync up, like the weather function, but I don't mind it that much. I live in western Massachusetts so the weather is cold and/or rainy 90% of the time which I don't need a watch to tell me. It's also a little annoying that I will rearrange the order that the different screens on the watch show up in, and then it gets reset randomly, but again it's not a huge deal. The battery life is fantastic, and I do like that I can get calls and messages on it, and that I can also turn the Do Not Disturb feature on and not be bothered by notifications. Does this have every single feature that the Apple Watch has? No. Do I need those features? No. This does everything I need and I have no complaints at all so I'm really happy I found this.",

So far this has been great: features are all easy to navigate and display is nice and clear; has a good variety of functions but not an overwhelming array, which is what turned me off some of the other watches, and has a smaller face design which works wells with my strangely small wrist. I like the wider strap it comes with and you can change it out with any strap that's compatible. Good battery life per charge; I just hope it lasts longer than 8 months!",

I have contacted customer service and have not heard back in more than a week. Very disappointing. I can not recommend this watch, nor the company.I'm still working out which functions I need, but this is a very decent watch for the price. I haven't been able to connect to Alexa and am still having trouble with using it with my phone (keypad is too small for my fingers), but that's OK. I usually have my phone close by anyway. And I like the find my phone feature!The app is a good one, and has a very detailed instruction manual - the one included with the watch is little more than a quick-start guide. Workouts are a different function than activities, and there are plenty of workouts to go through - even elliptical, which is one I use the most. Seems to give good readings for pulse, oxygen, etc.. The music and camera controls also work well.All in all a good watch for the money; a good first step if you're looking to get into this, and may be all you need. It certainly is for me.

                "reviewText": "Alexa will turn on and off my Amazon Fire TV through this Gydom Smart Watch for Men. It will switch HDMI inputs on the TV through the Alexa option. The watch will pause, play, and advance YouTube videos and YouTube Music on my Android phone (Galaxy S9+). The watch will notify me of incoming gmail and messages. It will find my phone wherever I set the phone down. It will start and stop recording a video or snap a photo on my phone. It is a timer, a stopwatch, and an alarm clock. It gives a brief weather report and two day forecast. I won't go into the health and exercise aspects, because I am so busy working on my ranch that I don't have time or need to have a structured exercise type of lifestyle. It will take my pulse if I sit real still. It will not take my oxygen level. This is probably due to my age, skin, and body fat characteristics which are no doubt outside of the cohort which went into the design of the watch. The watch is very light weight and comfortable. It shakes off water like a dog shakes off water. Really, there is a function that does that. You swipe down and there is a raindrop symbol. Press that and the watch starts its little water shake dance. Yeah, it's pretty smart I would say.",

This watch gives you both long battery life and an easy to use app from the Google Play store. There are various watch faces to choose from, customisable app notifications and you can even answer calls. What I really like about this smart watch was the ability to change the band. The one supplied is very soft and comfortable, great for sleeping however if you wanted to wear this out I'd purchase a fabric or leather replacement. Watch arrived in a nice presentation box too.",

L\u2019abbinamento bluetooth tra lo smartwatch e il telefono \u00e9 avvenuto subito, senza problemi.Non \u00e9 stato necessario impegnarsi nel posizionarlo o stringere il cinturino, le misurazioni funzionano bene e le informazioni tra i due dispositivi sono quasi immediate.\u00c9 molto comodo sia per le chiamate che per i messaggi. Ha tante funzioni utili per chi va in palestra e vuole tenere sotto controllo i valori pi\u00f9 importanti. Ha molti programmi di allenamento ma non li abbiamo ancora provati.La durata della batteria \u00e9 ottima!Quindi a meno di sorprese posso dire che il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo \u00e9 pi\u00f9 che positivo. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
