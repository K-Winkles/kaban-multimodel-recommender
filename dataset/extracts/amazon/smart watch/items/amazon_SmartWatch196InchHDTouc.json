                "reviewText": "This watch was easy to navigate. I had no problems downloading and using the app. Has tons of options for sports and activities. Blood O2, heart rate, stress level, sleep monitor, distance tracker, calorie count, alarm, text and call notification, make calls, AI assist, music, camera, calculator, games, flashlight, download watch faces (these are ok but not abundant).My only issue is the size which is my fault as I wanted the 1.9\" screen for my old eyes and clumsy fingers. The watch is 1 1/2\" wide and 1 3/4\" tall for those who care. I gave it to my son since he's a big guy it works well for him. Also, you can switch out the band on this watch which is great. I like the magnetic bands and bought one to replace the silicone one that came with it. It's a 22mm band size.",

                "reviewText": "This was perfect gift I thought for my niece with Down syndrome as she wanted an iwatch, for her birthday but isn\u2019t able to take care of such an expensive item.The next best thing is to her this cute watch, looks like an Apple Watch, she can monitor her steps and other features I thought were ideal for a beginner.I charged it completely as it came uncharged. And when she finally used it after a full charge it didn\u2019t even last an hour and it died.So I recharged again over night this time and same thing it only lasted about 1 hr.I\u2019m really displeased with this and she was very sad as we\u2019ll because it takes so long to charge and then the battery drains so rapidly.Cute, easy to use, looks great five stars for that but the quality is not what I expected the battery life to last, so that a huge disappointment when she can\u2019t even enjoy it!",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Not as expected but sufficient",
                "reviewText": "This is my first fitness tracker and its performance to my expectations is poor. But, perhaps all wrist-worn trackers are the same. It has given me many hours of entertainment so maybe worth the bargain-basement outlay.Some context. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 plus on which I run both Samsung Health and Google Fit to count steps. My Google Health syncs with Walker Tracker, which my employer uses for fun challenges and activities I sometimes take part in. I have daily step records back to September 2014. I am not fit by any means - 185lbs, beer belly, 58yo - but I do clock 20'000 - 24'000 steps a day and 40'000 - 55'000 when I challenge myself. For years I have walked the same few routes before work and know I walk 18'750 +/- 50 steps on my most usual route. On that route Samsung Health generally reports ~200 more steps but since they both source data from the same phone pedometer I assume there are different start/stop algorithms in play. I am using the lower Google Fit count as my 'official' count as I have a longer history with that.Setting this watch up was a challenge, and I am very techy. It seems to depend on timing and how many steps are already logged at the time you start. Third time around after nuking the watch back to factory defaults and scrubbing the watch's app from my phone did the trick, but it erased my steps count for that day as it sync's the '0' it knew on top on the 23'000 I had accumulated in Google Fit. So, keep a screenshot to refer to if you want to put those steps/calories/distance/heart health data back again. The instructions are clear and logical, it just doesn't always work and when it does it will not really do its thing until after midnight and the daily counts everywhere reset. For me, the second and third days are working OK so far.In my example I am happy with the battery life. Heavy first-ownership use over 5 days and I am still at 45% after a full-charge as soon as I began. The O2, heart rate sensors corresponds with my wife's clinical equipment so for now they give good comparative measures.My largest disappointment is around step accumulations and how the watch and Google Fit work together while synchronized. I had hoped that over short intervals (30s, 60s perhaps) whichever had the higher count would win and synchronize to the running total. So, if I did not wear my watch it would not affect my phone's count, and if I laid my phone down and walked with only my watch the watch's count would add to the overall total later. What seems to be happening is that the watch's count always supersedes the phone's count.When I walk I carry a 32oz vacuum insulated water bottle. It weighs about 3lbs, full. If I carry it in my left hand it damps the swing of my left arm and the watch does not count the correct number of steps. Over 2 miles if I use my right hand the tally is as expected; if I use my left hand the tally is 3300 vs 4450 and worse the too low count overwrites the one maintained by Google Fit. I tend to favor my right hand and this morning my 18750 step walk (2+ years of history with about 50 step variability) reports as 16476 steps. That is worse than useless to me.I do not see myself continuing with this very much longer. I will update this review if anything changes. I will likely explore more expensive watches and see if any have my desired step count behavior.A lot of technology and fun for the money but this watch does not deliver the step behavior I hoped for. Provides nice eye-candy heart, OS, sleep and whatever stress measures represent though.",
