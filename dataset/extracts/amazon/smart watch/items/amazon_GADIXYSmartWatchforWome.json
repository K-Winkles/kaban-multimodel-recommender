The first thing I noticed is that the instructions are lacking, especially on how to charge and how to use all the features. They were very brief. I did not like that the weather app was in Celsius and not Fahrenheit. For the life of me I could not get the messages to appear on the watch and the feature for answering a call, the audio was very grainy. I also do not think the sleep monitor was working properly.
