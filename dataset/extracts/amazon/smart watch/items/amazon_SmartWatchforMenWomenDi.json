It's very user friendly.I've had it for 10 days connected via bluetooth the entire time and it just now needs charging.It has all the features I need and many more. The best part is the phone call function. I was blown away at the volume and clarity of the sound of the calls.The heartrate, Spo2 and step count features are all extremely accurate as I have checked them while wearing other devices and they are pretty spot-on. The sleep tracker was close but, needs improvement.I purchased this watch when my Garmin died and this was supposed to fill in while I did my normal month long research before buying my next name brand smartwatch. I am so pleased with this watch I'm not getting another. This is the one!And you cant beat the price!!!",

                "reviewText": "I really am impressed with this little watch. It looks great and works far better than I was expecting. Sure it isn't a 400 dollar Samsung smart watch or an apple watch, but for the price that's paid, this makes a GREAT pedometer to track your steps, and it works great for checking in on your sleep, ESPECIALLY because the battery last like 4 or 5 days!!! It way outlasted my samsung and I was able to see how my sleep was each night instead of having to charge the watch like I do my samsung.With the app, you have a pretty decent choice of fun faces. The app has some other data tracking features that can be useful.It came with 2 watch bands, which I changed to the other one it provided right away as I liked it better. But the bands are comfortable. I have had no discomfort at all.It does a great job of relaying your texts to you. You don't get to type a reply back, but have you ever tried texting on a watch? But it is great to have the texts show up and easy to read. It also has the ability if you set up your phone, you can shake your watch to take the picture. That's pretty awesome. I also like that you can use it as a transmitter for google assistant. I have my house set up to use google assistant so I can just turn my lights on and off by talking to the watch. It can be used as a speakerphone or just play music through it.Overall I found a lot of function in this watch at this price. I was actually very surprisingly pleased with it. It's not gonna compete with a 400 dollar watch, but this is a fantastic little fitness and sleep tracker with other features as well. Great for the price.",

There are so many features Fitbit doesn't have but this one offers I'm happy. Things I love: feature to find your phone with your watch, you can have pictures as a background, voice assistant, it shows you the weather even days out, it tracks sleep and steps (Yes you don't get a sleep score like Fitbit but I'm okay with it for all these other features), place calls, show contacts, show messages (Fitbit only does text messages this one shows all messages app you choose like WhatsApp and Facebook) and you can play music. It's a great smart watch for the price!! Only downsize is that the screen is big if you have a small arm like me.",

                "reviewText": "I have owned a few fitness watches. I was not sure what to expect with one at this price. Let me just say, I have been pleasantly surprised.So far, I haven't run into anything I don't like about this watch. I love the big screen. I can easily read the information on it, and there are many watch faces to choose from. You can even have a picture on it. I like that I can choose one that tells me the temperature.This watch also has tons of fitness activities you can choose from to record your workout. I would say that whatever activity it is that you enjoy, it's very likely to be on the list.I also like the various other features that have been included. Not only can you receive text messages on it, but you can also use it to talk on the phone, play music on it, or even use it to snap a picture from your phone!I also like the app you use with this watch. It provides me with all the information I need. I like that it tells me not only how many steps I've walked, but the approximate miles I've walked, too. My last fitness watch didn't. Now, it may not give me a sleep score (which I don't really need), but it does show me my deep sleep, light sleep and time awake, and also shows it laid out in a timeline that I can actually read on my phone without my reading glasses. I actually needed reading glasses to read that for my last watch, and even then it was hard to read.So far this has proven to be a great watch. I'm extremely happy with it, and extremely happy that I decided to try it out.",

Ma \u00e8 presente anche la funzione di movimento per attivarlo, che trovo molto comoda.Un altro pregio da non sottovalutare \u00e8 che una volta indossato ti dimentichi di averlo, \u00e8 molto leggero.Le funzionalit\u00e0 sono INFINITE!- Battito cardiaco- Sonno- Contapassi- Registro distanza percorsa- Calcolo calorie bruciate- Meteo- Pressione arteriosa- Ossigeno nel sangue- Sport- Notifiche per messaggi- Ricevere e effettuare chiamate (registrando per\u00f2 un massimo di 100 contatti)- Ascoltare la musica (ovviamente essendo collegati al cellulare con il bluethoot)- Assistente vocale- Cronometro- Timer- Potete scegliere se far riprodurre i suoni del telefono, ad esempio mentre scrivete un messaggio o guardate un video (funzionalit\u00e0 attivabile o meno)- Cambiare il tema di visualizzazione delle varie funzioni (nelle impostazioni)- Cambiare la schermata di visualizzazione dell\u2019ora (cambiabile velocemente tenendo premuta la schermata e scorrendo)Tramite l\u2019app potete, oltre a controllare tutti i dati registrare fino a quel momento:- Attivare le notifiche per altre app, io ad esempio ho attivato whatsapp in modo da ricevere messaggi sullo smartwach- Effettuare la ricerca dell\u2019orologio tramite l\u2019app se lo perdete- Cambiare il tema della schermata di visualizzazione dell\u2019ora sia impostando immagini predefinite nell\u2019app, sia caricando una foto che avete nel telefono- Impostare una sveglia- Impostare una vibrazione ogni tot di tempo se state troppo sedutiSull\u2019app comunque potrete trovare tutte le informazioni e impostazioni necessarie (il nome dell\u2019app si pu\u00f2 trovare nel foglio di istruzioni e anche nell\u2019orologio tramite il QR CODE).Anche la batteria dura molto, circa 5 giorni, poi dipende ovviamente da quanto lo usate e cosa ci fate.E mi sembra inutile parlare del rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo, per 20,99\u20ac tutto questo, non me l\u2019aspettavo davvero.Sono veramente contenta di quest\u2019acquisto, straconsiglio!",
