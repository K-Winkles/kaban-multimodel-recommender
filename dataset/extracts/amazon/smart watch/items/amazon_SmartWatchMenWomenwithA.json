                "reviewText": "I have fully tested this watch. In a flood of smart watches on the market this one is good, with a couple of niggles to keep in mind. Compared to other smart watches, the interface is intuitive, easy to learn/use and is relatively bug free. The phone app is also easy to use and learn and has a comprehensive set of exercise and health monitoring tools.What this watch does not have is a blood pressure function. Nor does it have a numeric calculator. It does have Alexa functionality but not Google assistant (I found that most watches have one or the other). Nor does the phone app have a \"find watch\" function although the watch has a \"find phone\" function. Another little gripe here is that when you use the \"find phone\" function, it sets the ring tone and notification volume for the phone to 100% and leaves it there.One function all these watches seem to have is a \"do not disturb\" (DND) function. This one (and a few others) have an extended DND: Absolute and scheduled. That is, you can set the watch to DND but you can also schedule a time window for the DND. I found the absolute DND worked but the scheduled DND did not fully exit until a minute after the expire time.A final gripe is the phone app is heavily laden with prompts to create an account, subscriptions, awards, badges, hyperlinks and cartoonish graphics. Some may like this immersive type of interface, but I don't.Overall, I liked this watch and would have no problem recommending it. :O)",

Setting up this watch was a breeze. I simply downloaded app and followed the instructions and my watch was paired with my smart phone. The heart rate monitor was fairly accurate when compared to the heart rate monitor on my blood pressure cuff. It seems more accurate at rest. The watch also has a pedometer and a blood oxygen monitor, which also seem accurate. The watch feels comfortable on my wrist and can be worn throughout the day without causing irritation. The battery life is pretty impressive with charges lasting around 5 days depending on how the watch is used. The Alexa feature is an added bonus that many watches of this variety do not boast. The display is bright, the graphics are pretty impressive, and the touch screen is responsive. Overall, a really solid watch for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Before investing in a high-end smartwatch, I tried this more affordable option to see if it suited my needs. The features like heart rate monitoring, SpO2, sleep tracking, and fitness tracking seemed promising, and the 1.8\" display was a decent size.Pairing the watch with my iPhone could have been more consistent. Sometimes it worked seamlessly, but there were instances where it failed to connect, which was frustrating. Another issue I encountered was the watch randomly taking over calls from my phone. This unexpected switching between devices was not only inconvenient but also quite aggravating during important calls. On the plus side, the watch is comfortable to wear, and the ability to switch out the bands is a nice touch for personal customization. The 5ATM waterproof rating and the step and calorie tracker were functional and reliable. while this smartwatch offers some great features at an affordable price, the issues with Bluetooth connectivity and call handling were significant drawbacks. It's a decent starter option for those new to smartwatches, but be prepared for some connectivity quirks.",

                "reviewTitle": "Decent fitness tracker, poor app/privacy concern, typical build quality, inaccurate monitors",
                "reviewText": "This is a reasonably decent (albeit basic in comparison to most others) fitness tracker/smart watch (IDW19) that appears well-built and for the most part works as expected having all 2 of the most common monitors (HR and SpO2, but not BP) which is typical of these devices nowadays. However, this unlike most others with metal casing/shell, the shell/case for this is entirely made of plastic including the buckle which is a bit shocking to see (rarely) and at the same time disappointed.It does have many of the standard features as most other budget or off-brand smart watches have and it has the typical silicone/rubber straps. In addition, it also has a plastic buckle whereas most others have a metal one instead and that tells you a lot about this watch, isn't it? Lastly, it has a single crown which again is rather basic and that's certainly nothing to write home about.\u2261 NoteThese so-called SMART WATCHES are really just FITNESS TRACKERS with added features (i.e. flashlight, calculator; mostly useless ones too) and it's NOT a true smart watch/device. A true smart device operates by itself on its own without the NEED to install an App for it to run and without depending on another device (i.e. your phone) to run.For instance, if your PHONE requires an App to be installed on a LAPTOP in order for various functions on your phone to work, or if your phone would lose certain features WHEN your laptop goes offline, would you consider your phone to be a SMART phone? Well, I wouldn't and I'll be extremely upset if that's the case, and that's exactly what happens here most of these so-called smart watches.###\u2261 FeaturesBy standard I don't mean one or two, in fact, the standard nowadays is about a dozen or so including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen monitor just to name a few. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the BP monitor but perhaps more disappointingly is the fact that the HR monitor doesn't seem to be accurate at all (SpO2 appears to be reasonably accurate for the most part although we know the figures for the vast majority of healthy people is usually either 98% or 99%) which is quite upsetting to have found out after numerous tests. In addition, the steps counter seems to be off by about 3900+ so that's not exactly accurate either.It also has the typical sports and/or exercise related features that many others have. It has a reasonably large screen of 1.8\" but this has been somewhat of a norm at this point in time so that's nothing to write home about either. I should also note that the advertised 100+ sports requires the app; otherwise, only a handful or so are available (which is more than most people would need under normal circumstance).\u2261 BatteryIts battery capacity is unknown because it's NOT advertised and that's always a warning sign to me because everyone wanna brag about good things and the lack of it usually signifies the opposite. In either case, whatever the capacity might be, the only thing I really care is that it can last me an entire day (charge once a day is fine with me). Btw, I suspect it has a 300 mAh battery based on past experiences.With that being said, I also don't have a clue about the longevity of the battery but that's a common concern for all rechargeable smart watches out there (i.e. battery dies unexpected fast). Note that the default screen timeout is 5sec which is unusably short for me but it can be increased up to 30 seconds (whereas some other can't t at all while a few can do 60 sec) so that's great. I don't necessarily want 30 sec but it's nice to have the options (I set mine to 15sec).\u2261 Water resistanceBtw, these fitness trackers/smart watches are NOT meant to be submerged in water (salty or otherwise) longer than a few minute even though they advertised as being IP68 or even 5 ATM which is completely nonsensical if you know what that really means (around 50m under water but it's really meant for accidental submersion); otherwise, there is an extremely high probability that it will die prematurely.\u2261 AppFor those who are curious about what the 'VeryFit' app (3.7 rating) requires;\u2718 Any data may be shared with other companies or organizations, including but not limited to;* Email address and Phone number, Fitness info, Precise location, Photos and videos, Contacts* SMS or MMS, Files and docs, Installed apps, Device or other IDs\u2718 Data isn't encrypted (typical practice in China)* Data is encrypted during transit\u2718 Device & app history* read sensitive log data\u2718 Contacts* read your contacts\u2718 Location* approximate location (network-based), precise location (GPS and network-based)\u2718 Phone* directly call phone numbers, read call log, read phone status and identity, Photos/Media/Files* read the contents of your USB storage, modify or delete the contents of your USB storage\u2718 Storage* read the contents of your USB storage, modify or delete the contents of your USB storage\u2718 Camera & Microphone* take pictures and videos, record audio\u2718 Wi-Fi connection information* view Wi-Fi connections\u2718 Device ID & call information* read phone status and identity\u2718 Other* receive data from Internet, view network connections, pair with Bluetooth devices, access Bluetooth settings* control flashlight, full network access, run at startup, control vibration, prevent device from sleeping\u2718 NoteLike nearly all other budget smart watches (or any other 'smart' devices really) out there, an App is REQUIRED for this to function at its fullest which means you are giving the manufacturer (and whoever they decide to share it with or without your permission) AND the app OWNER (i.e. some company in China and that equates to the gov in this case) your COMPLETE and entire historical data.Some people consider some of these (i.e. precise GPS location, health info, heart rate, blood pressure, or the alike) to be 'extremely' personal information and therefore are private. Data mining, analysis, prediction, and eventually profit making and/or a form of control will be vital in many aspects of our lives in the foreseeable future. If this concerns you at all, look elsewhere.###\u2261 ValueAll things considered, this is a somewhat decent (albeit basic) FITNESS TRACKER (with some smart watch functions) that works just fine if you don't care about any of the issues mentioned above, in particular the issues with the HR monitor (and the lack of BP monitor of course). Suffice to say I'm not a big fan of the plastic shell/case/buckle and that's quite disappointing to see to say the least. It's a bit pricey at $60 for what it provides (a generic fitness tracker, IDW19) and its overall build quality and performance. There are other options and/or alternatives out there that are identical to this for about $40 or so if you care to shop around. Your mileage might vary.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this through the Amazon vine program in exchange for a honest Review. Here is my review.I own lots of smart watches. Expensive wear OS and Cheap generic versions like this one. I find some of the generic brands very good and on par with the expensive ones. This one however is not. This one is pretty bad.So let me begin with the unboxing. The watch comes with a white strap. You can get various colored options. The strap is extremely basic, Yet it feels nice on the wrist. The watch i got was silver. It comes with a magnetic USB charging cord and instructions.Upon opening the box you are informed to Charge the unit for the first time. Then when it is charged you are greeted with instructions to download a app and scan the QR code on the watch face. The app is called VeryFit. It is a standard run of the mill Generic smart watch app. It asks you to make a account. Offers free gifts and asks for your Amazon details to hook up Alexa. I used my burner Email to set up a account because I really don't trust the app.As i was doing this , I noticed the watch was extremely buggy. It was laggy. Double tapping, Triple tapping. Ignoring swipes. I set it the watch up hoping it was just the initial loading and booting. I even reset the watch. Powered it off and on. Restarted it. To my surprise the watch is just a laggy mess.Upon checking out the app I noticed something that really ticked me off. The free watch faces are extremely limited and downright ugly. All the nice watch faces cost money. Real money. This is not cool. So you are stuck with ugly watch faces unless you want to shell out some cash. The watch is not good enough to justify that type of monetization in the app.The watch is laggy. The steps do not match up with my other Generic smart watches or expensive Samsung or Ticwatch. The Heart rate monitor is off to. Almost everything was not matching up with my other watches. I can understand being a few steps off but 1000 steps is just not acceptable. Top that off with the fact they expect you to pay more money for all the nice watch faces is a hard pass for me.Alexa did not work on the watch for me. It simply would not connect to my Amazon account. Which is a major selling point of the watch.I cannot recommend this watch. Simply put, It is not good.",
