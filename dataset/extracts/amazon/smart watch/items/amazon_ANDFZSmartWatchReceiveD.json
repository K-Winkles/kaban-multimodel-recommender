I just needed something to track my steps, show my messages, take a call...track my sleep patterns. I found this watch after much searching and research. First of all the watch fits nicely. The screen is big and easy to read. The watch band is made from soft silicone and it is comfortable. It paired right away with my iPhone 8. No issue whatsoever. You can take calls from your watch, and you can ready text messages, however, you can't reply to texts... but you can make a call! I also like the different faces that you can download from the website. I also like that you can add your own. Again, very simple to use. I promise if you are looking for something simple and easy to use, and won't break the bank, this is your watch! The blood pressure was an added bonus for me plus the blood oxygen levels. Overall, without going into a lot of details, I loved this watch. It is a great buy and comes with so many helpful details. SmartWatches have come a long way, nowadays, you can get one for under $100.",

Now, this smart watch is AMAZING!!! I wear it all the time. I got it for work but the only time I take it off is to shower or clean the kitchen. It does everything it says it does. It's simple to connect to your phone. The speaker for the phone is clear. Text messages and phone calls come through without any problems. The band is pretty, the screen is large enough to read but not too big to make it look silly. I've had many compliments on my watch. This is the most worn watch I have. Looking for a new smart watch....look no further cause this is it!",

The blue tooth works really well and the speaker volume on the watch itself is the perfect volume to listen to my music. You can make calls and get your notifications on here from text to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and more! I love the band color and there\u2019s different little backgrounds and I found the perfect one for me! It has good battery life, charges relatively fast. I definitely recommend this watch!UPDATE:I forgot to take my watch off before I got into the shower and panicked when I realized that I had it on. This watch was drenched but low and behold it held up and still works like a champ!! If you\u2019re thinking about buying a smart watch look no further!!",

If your looking for a smart watch at a good price don\u2019t hesitate to purchase this watch you won\u2019t regret it!",

Happy to say it's pretty accurate to what her readings were when she visited the clinic. The only thing she has a problem with is the sleep tracking. It said she had slept and she definitely hadn't slept due to illness keeping her up. Otherwise she really loves this watch. It was easy for her to connect with the app and she loves that she can personalize the watch face with her own photos (see pic). She can go a week without having to charge it as well. Overall, we're very happy with the watch.",
