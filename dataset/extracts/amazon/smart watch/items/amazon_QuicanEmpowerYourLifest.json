                "reviewText": "Awesome watch! Tracks stress, blood oxygen, heart rate, sleep, calorie consumption, counts steps, sets exercise and weight goals, drinking water reminders, breathing excercise, several workout options, notifications, phone calls, and more. Very good app and easy to use. Perfect size, very good looking and excellent price! The only thing we would change is that the back is not very flat and sometimes it sits wrong on the wrist bones. Nothing horrible, but need to adjust at times. Apart from that it is perfection!",

They even gifted two new skins for the inconvenience. Functionality is pretty good, the measurements seem to be correct. I read other reviews that said it wasn't, but it seems to be for me. You can't text from the watch, but you can call and talk. That feature works well, the person on the other end didn't seem to find an issue with hearing me. You do receive all notifications you grant permission for, so you can read the text messages, just can't reply. It's a nice smartwatch for the cost.",

It shouldn't take forever to set it up and use it much less even sign on to the Veryfit app. It went right back into the box and will be returned. No time for toys. I get that it's a very low cost item but it needs to at least work. I wanted to see if it was something he would use before investing in a higher ticket item. I'd stay clear of this one.",

                "reviewText": "The watch looks good and has a nice, crisp display, it also has a variety of faces available for use. Battery life seems good. I have only had the watch for ten days and found the charge lasted about a week before recharging was needed. It came charged to 99% right out of the box. The watch has kept accurate time thus far. I know the step count is inaccurate when tested with an accurate pedometer (count has been high 1,500 to 2,500 steps each day) and it has already twice counted me as being asleep for a couple of hours when I was not asleep, once when I sat down to watch television one evening, another time when I sat down to read, so I really cannot count on any of the other health readings as being accurate. The phone feature seems fine based on the one time I accidentally used it since the call came through my watch when I dialed on my phone due to the close proximity of the phone and watch, I could hear well, the person I called could hear me well. I am rating the watch based on the reasons I bought it. I mostly wanted it to count steps and to track sleep and this really is not the best watch for those purposes, since it has very quickly proven to be very inaccurate in both of those areas. Since I cannot trust it in those two areas, I cannot trust it with any of the other health indicators.Update January 22, 2024: I have now updated my original review of January 18, 2024 from 1 star overall to 3 stars overall based on great customer service. They contacted me to offer a full refund or a replacement watch since this watch did not meet my expectations and they indicated they wanted another chance. I am keeping the watch due to the positives listed above (great customer service, great battery life, crisp display, accurate time, good call quality) and since I at least have a guesstimate of steps and sleep (and other health parameters too), even if the numbers are inaccurate. Based on all of those factors listed, the watch is a good value for the price.",
