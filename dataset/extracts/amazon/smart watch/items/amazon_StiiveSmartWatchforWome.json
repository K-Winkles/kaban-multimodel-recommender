I did my research and wanted one that offered lots of versatile. I decided on the Stiive smart watch because, it's a great value, easy to use, and loaded with many options. This watch will keep track of the amount of steps I walk in a day. It will monitor your heart rate. Keeps track of how many hours you sleep and many more features. You can also customize your face dial with 100 plus choices or use one of your own pictures. The watch band is adjustable, very soft to the touch, and it is very comfortable when wearing it. To me the watch can be worn with a casual or dressy attire. The size of the face dial makes it very easy to read all of the settings. To connect the devise to your phone, I downloaded the app then I was able to sink the watch to my phone. Best of all this watch will help me to be a little more health conscience of my daily activities.",

                "reviewText": "After my Michael Kors version of a Galaxy smartwatch died, I wasn't ready to commit to the current versions then available via Samsung, but I really missed my watch. I decided to give this one a go and I must admit how pleasantly surprised I was at it's functionality. Definitely rivals a Samsung more than the Fossil or Kors version does. The band is easily switched out. The face protectors are compatible. Matter of fact, I prefer this watch to the Kors version. I cannot tell you how many times I had to repurchase the charging cord for the Kors one. It seemed to be rather a lemon of a product. The software interface is great and not at all confusing for non-tech types. For the price this watch is, I am shocked not more people have / use it! Excellent pricing onthis product and I truthfully cannot recommend this watch enough!",

                "reviewText": "This watch died after just 6 months. I thought it just needed to be charged after going off, but have been charging it now for 24 hours and see no sign of life. Disappointing as prior to this, I found this a cheap but cheerful watch. It looked nice and did the job. But now I realise it was more of a fancy disposable product. Don\u2019t waste your money and time with it. Also, in general and before it completely died, the face is cute when you press a side button to light it, but otherwise the screen is black.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Looks great, works, text and phone call notifications, auto-syncs with app on phone, VERY affordableCons: the biggest con for me, and the reason I returned it, is the application did funky things to my phone. It didn't matter how I put my settings or what permissions I gave/didn't give, as soon as I downloaded the app and linked the watch, my phone alarms would no longer open on the phone - meaning, when my alarm would go off, I had to physically unlock my phone, select the alarm notification by swiping down from the top of the phone, then turn it off. The same would happen with phone calls but I didn't mind the phone calls so much. The alarm thing was really annoying when it would ring in the morning to wake me up.... Additionally, you cannot answer phone calls or texts on your watch.",

                "reviewText": "I was kinda sketched out to buy this, but it's one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. Yes, it's big- my arms are not small. But it's realistic and has never gotten in the way of any daily task. It is so straight forward, giving you your steps, heart rate and calories burned. You can switch back and forth on the screens by swiping, to get a specific recording tab, music from your phone, settings for your background, weather, etc.I have NOT taken this underwater or showered with it, however I have worn this under my boxing gloves and during workouts when I'm sweating a ton, has never bothered it. One charge lasts me well over a week.There aren't 7000 things to do on this and that's why I like it. The others seem like they have excessive features that you 1- don't need or 2- don't care about.It's worth the buy.",

The cost of this watch is super affordable.2. Simple menu, easy to navigate after a couple weeks of use.3. Time, date, steps, heart-beat.. all on main screen.4. I am asthmatic and now have instant access to my blood oxygen level.5. I can track my exercise really easily, and the data tracks on the calendar on the mobile app.6. Super comfortable.7. I get my mobile messages & can see if important or not.8. I can set it to remind me to hydrate and move9. Easy to use mobile appCons:1. Sometimes doesn't \"wake up\" without pushing the button.2. Can't reply to messages.",
