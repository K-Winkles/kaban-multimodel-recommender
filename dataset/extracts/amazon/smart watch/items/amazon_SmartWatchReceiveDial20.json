                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this smart watch for hands-free calling and wanted to have more control over my fitness routine. The setup was quick and straightforward and I was able to customize the watch face to my liking. The watch pairs easily with my phone and the dedicated app has good performance.One of the features I liked was the 10 pre-programmed workouts, but I did find the heart rate and step count estimation to be slightly inaccurate. However, this smart watch does have a weather info feature, alarm, timer, and stopwatch functions which I found very useful.One con I encountered was the touch sensitivity and swipe controls, which can be fickle at times. Additionally, the workout in the app does not automatically track GPS movement. The heart rate in the app dashboard is also only based on 30-minute polling.Overall, I think this smart watch is a good option for average users looking for a watch with basic fitness tracking features. The watch has an expensive look for an affordable price and can serve well unless you require better workout tracking capabilities. The watch also comes with its own silicone screen protector, which was a nice bonus.",
