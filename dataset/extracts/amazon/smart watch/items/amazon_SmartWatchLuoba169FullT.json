                "reviewText": "Smart watches are often hit or miss in this price range, but this one is pretty good for what you get. I will admit that the battery life could be better, but I have a smartwatch from a top brand with battery life issues as well and spent way more on that one. So the 5 stars is because this price range usually means the watch will suffer in some areas and if you are the type to not sleep with your watch on you can just let it charge at night, if you like to sleep with your watch on like I do because the vibration on my arm works as a great alarm, charging it in the morning while you shower/get ready for your day is another option that can allow you to get the battery life you need in those moments you don't need to use your watch and it should last throughout the day after doing this. You need to give this a recharge once a day or every other day depending on usage.Watches in this price range often don't have a speaker or have poor speaker quality, this watch however has a really great speaker and sound is very clear. Screen size is great and screen is very clear and responsive. I was skeptical about the watch at first but I like it better than the one I spent over $400 for. The band is easily replaceable if you like to switch up the style on your arm. I'd say it's a good, budget friendly option for those, like me, who would rather have something that functions, looks good, and is reliable.",

Same with the heart rate.The step counter is pretty accurate.I don't use it to make or get phone calls so I just turn the phone app off.You can only set 3 alarms.The sound is not very good nor is the vibration. I set one alarm with the vibration on for a test, and couldn't feel it when the alarm went off.I like it enough to keep it, but would not buy it again.",

It has a number of features such as step tracking, heart rate and blood pressure tracking. I can't verify exactly how precise the heart rate and blood pressure tracking are, but the blood pressure measurement seems pretty similar to what I've gotten at the doctor's and the pharmacy's machine, so it seems to work reasonably well.The battery life seems pretty good. I've been charging it about once every 4 days or so and it hasn't run out of battery at any point with that charging schedule, so it lasts for a while.It also has a number of features that I don't use much, such as breathing reminders, sleep trackers, a music player, a camera shutter button to control your phone camera, and a workout tracker.All the features sync through the app so you can see additional detailed information on your phone.",

                "reviewText": "Works ok as a device to notify you of messages and all from your phone.Step count is probably better than Fitbit for truck drivers, although still kind of high. I would get 10k steps in a day on my Fitbit by only driving my truck. And sometimes over 100 flights of stairs of I had lots of hills. With this device I'm averaging about half the number of steps.The most confusing part was Bluetooth pairing. I was getting stats for steps, hear taste, blood pressure, etc. However, no phone management, voice assistant or messages. The app connected fine. Not sure why this needs 2 types of connections... Anyway, after I sent an email to support, I turned the watch off. When I turned it on again, I got a notification that it wanted to pair to my phone. So I accepted and now that all works.Still haven't heard from support after 3 days.Another issue is that sleep tracking on the app starts at midnight. It doesn't count the hours if I go to sleep at 10pm, nor does it count those hours as part of the previous day. If I get up at 4:30am, it looks like I only got 3.5 hours of sleep for the day.The other gripe is that the date display on the watch is day/month. I see no way to change it to month/day as in the US I'm used to that format.I've lowered my rating. Still having major issues with Bluetooth pairing. Sometimes it's connected, most of the time it's not so I don't get notifications. No response from support.",

                "reviewText": "Wir suchten eine Smartwatch aber wollten keine 200-300 Euro daf\u00fcr ausgeben. Hauptgrund war eine Anzeige der Nachrichten wie zum Beispiel WhatsApp ohne immer das Handy aus der Tasche holen zu m\u00fcssen.Wir hatten schon eine andere Uhr probiert aber da ging das nicht sehr zuverl\u00e4ssig.Mit dieser jetzt funktioniert es sehr gut.Auch die Anbindung \u00fcber die App mit dem Handy hat auf Anhieb geklappt. Das Material ist angenehm zu tragen. Ein nettes Detail ist der Stift, mit dem man das Armband wechseln kann ist toll gemacht so geht ein Wechsel leicht und ohne Werkzeug.Dazu gibt es einige Sportfunktionen wie Schrittz\u00e4hler so das man man sie im Rahmen auch f\u00fcr den Sport benutzen kann.In Summe w\u00fcrden wir diese im Vergleich g\u00fcnstige Uhr wieder kaufen, sie macht was sie soll und bisher sehr zuverl\u00e4ssig.",
