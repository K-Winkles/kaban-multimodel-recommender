However, the watch is pretty intuitive and I got through it. Battery life is great for me. I only have step monitoring turned on. My charges last 4-5 days. If I turn on the other monitoring functions I have to charge everyday. Charging takes less than an hour.I love being able to change the watch face and to customize it. It makes the watch fun. I'm finding that I'm using Alexa on this watch quite a bit too.The phone on this device works great and so does text/email notification once your settings are in place. I genuinely recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "Works great for the price. After having it for a few weeks here are my observations.Cons:* I do not like the plastic band that this and many other watches come with these days. It was easy to replace with a 22mm band I already had* A few times it has stopped transmitting my heart rate to the phone.* Charts in the app can be hard to view. No way to expand them to make them easier to see.Pros:*Easy to see screen.* You can set it to come on when you raise your wrist to view the time. This is easy to turn off and on from the watch. I like it on when I am awake and off when I am trying to sleep.* Battery lasts me the week and then some. I charge it on Mondays and then again on Friday. It goes from ~85% change to ~50% charge. I could charge less often but if I charge on Mondays and Fridays the time it takes to charge matches the time I spend in the bathroom getting around those mornings. I put it on the changer and it is back to ~85% charged by the time a shower, brush my teeth, shave, etc. There are a number of options that effect how fast it uses charge so your experience my vary.* Many dial faces and you can make your own. Many of the faces and the ability to make your own are no change. Other faces cost a small fee. I have been plenty happy with the free ones. You can fit a number of faces on the watch and easily switch between them. It is easy to make your own custom simple digital face. You pick a background photo and a choose where the time will appear on the screen and what color to use for the time. My normal watch face is our dogs.* The sleep tracking seems to be as accurate as you would expect. Of course, if you are awake but staying really still it may think you are asleep.* The company seems to still be supporting this watch. It got a firmware update a few weeks after I purchased it.",

I didn't want to spend another 200-300 dollars for another watch so I purchased this one for under 30.00 I downloaded the app and it works better than my Versa. They offer different bands also. This watch does more than my Versa and it's easy to set up. Thanks, Amazon for offering a watch that doesn't break the bank!!",

If I use my watch on a daily with all the functions I need there it will last me 3 days at the most NOT 7 days. Be wary of your watch battery life if you do need something that will last a little longer before having to recharge. If you just need to use it simply as a watch then yes it might last you the 7 days, but if not and you want to utilize it's functions remind yourself to charge your watch every other night.",

Pour le coup c'est une feature tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante car cela permet beaucoup d'interaction avec la montre et celle-ci devient beaucoup plus \"intelligente\". Par contre, je n'ai pas os\u00e9 tester cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 .... Normalement les risques sont tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s mais je me vois mal me connecter \u00e0 mon compte amazon depuis l'application de la montre .... Pas assez confiance.- int\u00e9gration d'un calcul de stress (ca vaut ce que ca vaut ... )A noter que l'application est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et est plut\u00f4t r\u00e9ussie.Concernant la qualit\u00e9 de la mesure de la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, elle s'en tire bien sur les efforts l\u00e9gers et mod\u00e9r\u00e9s (je l'ai compar\u00e9 \u00e0 une pixel watch qui a de bonnes mesures). Par contre, comme beaucoup de montres, elle peine beaucoup dans les efforts a plus haute intensit\u00e9 et les fractionn\u00e9s.Malgr\u00e9 tout, il y a quand m\u00eame pas mal de lacunes :- pas de GPS, donc pour les sportifs, il faudra avoir votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec vous si vous souhaitez avoir le suivi GPS- pas beaucoup d'applications install\u00e9es et impossible d'en installer d'autres- beaucoup de cadrans disponibles (tr\u00e8s bon point) mais les cadrans ne sont pas int\u00e9ractifs (par exemple, celui sur la photo, on pense qu'on peut appuyer sur les petites vignettes mais non)- beaucoup de sports propos\u00e9s mais je doute que les algos derri\u00e8re chaque sport soient vraiment optimis\u00e9s.Au final cette montre offre un bon rapport qualit\u00e9 prix et son avantage par rapport aux autre, c'est l'int\u00e9gration d'Alexa, si vous avez confiance pour l'installer.",
