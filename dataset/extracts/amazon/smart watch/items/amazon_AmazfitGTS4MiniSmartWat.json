                "reviewText": "I've had the following watches: Moto 360, ZenWatch 2, Galaxy Watch (1 & 3).Most of those met an untimely end due to ONE issue, the firmware would get updated and the device would become unbearably slow. Google Watch OS or Tizen OS, didn't matter. The Moto, however, had display issues that Moto wanted me to pay for fixing (under warranty).These are a breath of fresh air. No fancy gimmicks or useless gizmos. They did a great job including features that are useful but not wasteful. Most importantly, the OS (i think it's RTOS) means it's never slow.The battery life is great. I went on a week long trip to my sister's place and didn't need to bring a charger. Used AOD 50% of the time (timed to turn off after 8pm, back on at 8am).If you want a smart watch that you can receive notifications with, but that doesn't require you to watch the battery percentage all day, this is fantastic at it.Couple of caveats (forgiven at this price point):1. Glass isn't very durable, I've got a few chips in mine.2. OS isn't super stable. I've seen it crash and reboot a few times, but the reboot time is very fast.3. Watch faces aren't really that great on the market. I attempted to make my own and you have to upload an individual picture for each number, for each position. Who designed that???4. AOD will not have the numbers line up exactly with the watch face. This is by design to save the screen from burn in.5. It should be easier to have maps display route guidance (just next turn direction and distance is all you need). Currently you need to install a companion app (which requires permissions it doesn't need) and if you put your watch down for too long (you know because you are driving...) it will put the app to sleep and you need to go back in to open it again. At the very least, remember what app was open and open back up to it.6. Duplicate text notifications. I believe this to be an API limitation from Android. However, you can solve this in software by keeping track of recent texts and double checking they aren't the same before displaying them. I've programmed a system like this before for Twitch's API due to mirror update lag. It's not beyond capability.7. The companion app (required for a lot of stuff to work) seems to collect and sell your data to offset price on watch. I'm personally fine with this, but you should know that before you buy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Style: Quite surprised how great it looks with the metal rim.Screen: Vivid and colorful screen (1.65\u201d AMOLED). Seems fine under sunlight. It makes use of the full screen size. Has auto light detection. Can set so when the wrist is raised, the screen comes on. Note: Can even upload a personal background photo as a watch face.Battery: Have not fully tested but after 2 weeks still over 50 percent left. I tested the heart rate, oxygen, and stress 2-3 time. I turn them off and do it manually to save battery. The battery seems to last quite long as described.Size: About same size as Amazfit Bip. I have a smallish medium wrist, and already use the 4th to the last slot on the band. May fit a medium to large wrist, but may not fit a much larger wrist.Weight: Solid and does not feel heavy at all.Notifications: It can receive phone notifications with the option to ignore or cancel the call. Can receive text, app notifications, and messages. However, cannot talk or text replies back on the watch, which I already knew. You can talk to Alexa to operate certain functions. Note: Apps will be listed, and notifications can be turned on once the app sends a push notification. The list starts small, and expands over the days.Alexa: I asked \u201cwhat is the weather\u201d, and it opened the weather screen immediately. Have not tried other commands.Zepp App: Downloaded the Zepp app. Linked, no problem for me, just by scanning the QR code on the watch. Most of the functions can be set both on the watch and on the app.Other Features: Integrated global positioning, water resistant (5 ATM), download calculator, alarm, workout, sleep monitor, calendar, world clock, stop watch, countdown, change time format, change temperature format, and many other features or functions.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this watch, but I can't say I love it. I bought this watch within my budget. Mainly to keep track of my activity to keep me committed to the gym. It does okay at tracking steps, but it isn't always accurate. I have my phone on me as well as my watch when I run. My phone will tell me I've ran 4 miles while my watch says I'm only at 3 1/2. The treadmill will also give me how many miles I ran and it seems my phone is more accurate at tracking my step count than the watch.For everything else, the watch works just as intended. I think it's a fair buy for the price I paid. It was very glitchy in the beginning, however with a few updates, it works trouble free. You also have several free options for watch faces too, although I did purchase my current watch face in the app. The battery life is just as described, I charge my watch every two weeks. I'm very happy with that aspect as well as the overall features of the watch. The step count is the only reason why I didn't give this a 5 star, but it's very deserving of my 4 star review",
