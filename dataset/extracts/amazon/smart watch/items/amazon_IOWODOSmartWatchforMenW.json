La opci\u00f3n de llamada funciona muy bien, se oye perfectamente sin tener que acercarlo y se sincroniza muy f\u00e1cilmente con todos los contactos, lo que permite llamar sin marcar. Los mensajes se reciben tambien correctamente. Ya me ha pedido que le compre otro para su mujer y otro para regalar a su sobrino de 17 a\u00f1os, que lo ha visto y se ha encaprichado.
