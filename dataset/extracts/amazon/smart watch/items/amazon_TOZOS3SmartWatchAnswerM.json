I really like the look of the watch and the band. It was very easy to connect to my phone and all features seem to work well. The app is easy to use. I can't speak to the exercise portion too much except to say the step counter is accurate and I like the way it monitors and records my sleep. I mostly wanted a watch that could notify me about calls/texts, emails, etc., and this watch does all of that. You can answer/make phone calls. It shows your text messages and has option to delete old messages. You can also store up to 10 contacts from your phone. It keeps up with the weather, and I can play music too. The speaker is clear and works good. I'm very pleased with this watch overall and only have 1 minor complaint which is the watchfaces. My last watch was really cheap and didn't work very well at all, but there were 200 different watchfaces for free and you could personalize them or use your own photos and choose which features you wanted to see at a glance on the screen. Hopefully Tozo will catch up with some of the other apps soon and give us more choices and control over the watchfaces, but otherwise this is a good watch for the price and I have already recommended it to a few people who have asked me about it.**edit 1 month later**Tozo watch did not last. Health features stopped working on day 28. Customer service was responsive but weren't able to restore the watches features. I am in refund process now. I take reviews seriously because I rely on other people's reviews and experiences. I still like Tozo and would purchase other products from them, but buyer beware on this S3 watch.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a customer for several of Tozo\u2019s excellent earbuds, and was offered the opportunity by Tozo to try out their S3 smartwatch. I took them up on their offer and would like to offer my take on the watch and how it compares to another smartwatch I have, the Fitbit Versa 3.Let me start out by saying that the Tozo S3 is an amazing deal. At a price that is a fraction of the price of the Fitbit, it is hard to believe that Tozo can put out a watch of this quality at the price at which they are offering it. While there are a few things that the Fitbit can do that the Tozo cannot, for the most part the Tozo can do everything most people are going to need.Here are some positives and negatives:POSITIVES:1. The battery life has been great. It is at least double what I get from the Fitbit. I know there are a lot of factors that influence battery life, and there are some things that the Fitbit can do that impact battery life that are not an option on the, such as the ability to have a power saving setting that still shows the time constantly. I do use that setting, and I\u2019m sure that impacts the Fitbit battery life. But that feature is probably not needed by most people anyway, and the battery life on the Tozo has been very impressive.2. The display is crisp and clear and set up logically. The physical button on the Tozo makes it easy to get into the menu system. Although it does not appear that you can tap the screen on the Tozo to wake it up like you can on the Fitbit, the wrist action setting works well.3. The app is excellent, and there are lots of option in the app to add many different exercise routines. More than what is available on the Fitbit.4. The Bluetooth phone connection works very well, and I was able to place and answer calls without a problem. Not unexpectedly, the sound is tinny due to the tiny speaker involved, but it was still clear and very usable.5. They have many nice watch faces available for download for free, and I found one that shows all the information on the main screen. It\u2019s nice that they give you so many options.6. The Bluetooth connection was easy to make and works well. No problem making or maintaining the Bluetooth connection.NEGATIVES:1. I like to keep track of my heart rate, and while the screen does show the heart rate on the different exercise routines, the heartbeat readout is very small, whereas it is much larger and easier to see on the Fitbit. It is not easy to see without having to bring the watch closer to you. On a personal level this is probably the biggest complaint I have with the watch, although it would not stop me from buying it. If Tozo sees this review I hope they will consider increasing the size of the heartbeat readout, since it appears that there is plenty of room to do that.2. There is no GPS. I am listing this as a negative here only because this could be an issue for some people who are walking outside and want an accurate distance calculation beyond what the watch can do on its own. The Fitbit does have GPS. Of course, I\u2019m sure that is one of the things that accounts for the big difference in price. For me the lack of GPS is not an issue at all, since my exercise is all done indoors. If that is your situation, then you would just be paying for something you don\u2019t really need with the Fitbit.3. The Fitbit has a read out that shows what they call \u201cActive Zone Minutes\u201d, which takes into account your heartbeat level to determine how good a workout you are getting. I like that because I can tell at a glance how good a workout. While the Tozo does show you what percentage of time you spent in each heart rate zone, it doesn\u2019t have this additional calculation to show you a combined score using what Fitbit calls their \u201cActive Zone Minute\u201d readout. While this is certainly not a dealbreaker by any means, this would be a great addition to the Tozo if they could do it.I don\u2019t want to put this as a positive or negative, but potential purchasers with small wrists should be aware that the watch is fairly large. That, or course, is a positive in terms of the amount of information you can put on the screen, but if you have small wrists (like I do) you might want to consider one of the smaller Tozo smart watches if you plan to wear this all day. I only wear the watch when I am exercising, so it\u2019s not an issue for me, and I like having the larger screen. The watch and the band are both comfortable. Just something to keep in mind if you have small wrists.Overall I think this watch is an incredible value. I don\u2019t know how they can put out a smartwatch this good at this price. As long as you don\u2019t need GPS I would certainly recommend giving this watch a try. I have been impressed with Tozo\u2019s earbuds, and what I found with this smartwatch is consistent with that. I recommend this product highly.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first experience with a smartwatch, so I can\u2019t make any comparisons to other popular smartwatches. But with that said, I can tell you that the S3 has quite a bit to offer for the price, but in my review I\u2019m only going to touch on the features and apps that were most useful to me after using the S3 for a couple of weeks.\ud835\udde3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\u2022 Price: About $50.00 or less if you catch it on sale (a fraction of what you\u2019ll pay for a smartwatch from Apple, Samsung, Fitbit, etc.).\u2022 Fairly easy to use with a variety of built-in apps.\u2022 Comfortable to wear.\u2022 Very good battery life.\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\u2022 The companion app for Android & IOS needs improvement.\u2022 Minor functionality issues with some of the apps.\ud835\uddda\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1: The S3 comes packaged in an attractive box and includes a watch strap, charging cable, and a small, printed user manual. The printed manual will prompt you to install the companion app (Tozo Health) on your mobile device where you are stepped through a setup routine that is pretty straightforward: creating an account for Tozo Health, pairing the S3 with your device, and entering your physical stats (i.e. height, weight, and age) \u2013 this data is used as a basis for some of the included watch apps. I had no problems paring the watch with my Samsung phone.\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf1\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2: Overall the build quality seems good: the watch is mostly plastic although I\u2019m not certain about the watch crystal covering the screen (it could be glass or a high-quality acrylic material). The watch strap appears to be made of a soft, rubber-like material that was comfortable on my wrist (I could wear the watch for hours at a time without it becoming uncomfortable) \u2013 I also appreciated that the strap pins have these little protrusions that allow you to retract the pins with your fingers for inserting the strap into the watch itself (no need to use a knife or a spring bar tool \u2013 a very nice touch). I also appreciate that the watch is waterproof (\u201cIP68 waterproof\u201d according to the online product description) as I sweat profusely when exercising (especially outdoors in the Central Texas heat)! The S3\u2019s screen can be controlled by touch and is quite responsive. The watch crown also has some functionality when you press it, although it does not appear to do anything when you twist it around (at least not in my experience \u2013 perhaps this will change with future updates). I also found the screen to be bright enough for viewing outside in bright daylight. The S3 comes with a charging cable that is different from anything else I\u2019ve seen before: one end plugs into a standard USB socket (computer or USB charger) and the other end connects to the bottom of the watch via two metal contact points that are held in place with tiny magnets on the end of the charging cable. I\u2019m not sure why Tozo went this route instead of using a standard USB-C connector \u2013 my concern here is that if the charging cable fails then you will have to obviously obtain another one from Tozo. In any case, I didn\u2019t have any issues charging the watch with this cable and it didn\u2019t take very long to get a full charge which lasted well over a week (with a mix of casual usage and running the exercising apps) before needing to charge it again.\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfd\ud835\ude00: The S3 has built in apps for various exercise routines, health monitoring (e.g. heart rate, oxygen, sleep, stress level), weather, music playback on your mobile phone, making calls on your mobile phone and viewing text messages/notifications, and other utility apps (such as an alarm, timer, and stopwatch). There is also a \u201cFind Phone\u201d feature that will ring your phone in case you misplaced it, but this only works if the Tozo Health app is running on the phone, so it may only always be useful. A calculator app would have been nice to have. Oh, and did I mention that the S3 also functions as a wrist watch? \ud83d\ude0aI do a lot of walking (both indoors and outdoors), so the apps for these activities were the ones that I used the most. When walking or running, the S3 will calculate and record your steps, calories burned, distance, average pace, average heart rate, and other metrics as well. When used outdoors with the Tozo Health app it should show you your location (based on GPS data) when the app is configured to use Google maps, but I just couldn\u2019t get this feature to work even when giving the app all the permissions it required on my phone. If you choose not to take your phone with you while walking or running then the watch will still display and record your exercise data then later sync this data with your phone automatically when you reopen the app. Interestingly, I found that the outdoor walking app seems to overcalculate my steps. I tested this several times by walking to my neighborhood mailbox which is about 210 steps one way from the front door of my house (about 420 steps round trip, give or take a couple of steps). The watch consistently calculated this anywhere between 450 and 460 steps. My guess is that the S3 is calculating an average step size based on my physical height that I entered when setting up the watch. I tend to take larger-than-average steps when walking, so perhaps that is accounting for the difference. I also noticed that the watch didn\u2019t seem to accurately monitor my activity when walking on my treadmill \u2013 I couldn\u2019t figure this out until I read the following in the manual: \u201cwhen doing outdoor sports without continuous arm swing , such as riding, please turn on the exercise interface in the app, which will record your exercise data more accurately\u201d. So I take this to mean that the watch relies on detecting arm movement when walking or running \u2013 this is a problem for me because I always keep my arms stationary on the treadmill handrails, but the solution provided in the manual does seem to work as described, so overall this is just a minor gripe.The music control app worked fine for me but not with every music app that I tested on my phone (the S3 was able to control two of the three music player apps that I have installed). And using the phone call app on the S3 was a mixed bag: I was able to answer incoming calls using the watch and initiate outgoing calls using the dial keypad on the watch, but I could not initiate outgoing calls when selecting any of the 10 contacts that I imported into the watch from my phone (the S3 would act like it was dialing the contact but would then quit and go back to the contact list). I really liked the heart rate monitor and it seems fairly accurate (I tested this against taking my own pulse manually) and the watch will give you a constant average heart rate while exercising \u2013 very useful to ensure that you don\u2019t go over your max heart rate for your age.\ud835\uddd6\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude07\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb: My favorite option here were the watch faces that you can display on the S3. There are several built into the watch that you can instantly switch between as well as many others that you can import from the Tozo Health app, however, I was disappointed that the S3 only seems to allow you to retain one imported watch face from the app (i.e. it only seems to keep the last watch face that you import). I would like to see this improved as well as having more watch faces added to the app (animated watch faces would be nice).\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb: Overall I really like the S3 (especially at its price point) and have no problems recommending it as a budget smartwatch, but there is room for improvement and some bugs to be worked out, especially with the companion app since the S3 relies heavily on it. I\u2019m hoping that Tozo continues to develop its line of smartwatches which I think are a great value.\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udfec\ud835\udff5-\ud835\udfed\ud835\udff2-\ud835\udfee\ud835\udfef: I recently noticed that an update for the Tozo Health app was available in the Google Play store, so I installed it and found that the Google map feature now works in the app when walking or running outdoors. I still cannot make outgoing calls on my phone using the contacts that I imported into the watch, but at least it seems that Tozo is being responsive to updating the app, so I'm hopeful that some of these other minor quirks will be worked out in future updates.",

Das hat TOZO richtig gut hinbekommen :)Ersteindruck:Wie schon von anderen TOZO Produkten gewohnt, kommt die Verpackung sehr edel daher. Einmal ge\u00f6ffnet, pr\u00e4sentiert sich die S3 aufger\u00e4umt und \u00fcbersichtlich in ihrer Kartonbox.Materialien:Das mitgelieferte Armand f\u00fchlt sich sehr weich und dennoch robust an. Der Touchscreen aus Glas ist ebenfalls makellos. Auch der seitliche Knopf hat einen guten Druckpunkt. F\u00fcr den Preis absolut OK.Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Display:Perfekte Gr\u00f6\u00dfe - als Vergleich hab ich eine Apple Watch SE 44mm auf einem Foto beigef\u00fcgt. Die Unterschiede des ausgeschalteten Displays sind minimal (z.B. Eckradien fast identisch).Die Aufl\u00f6sung mit 240x284 Pixeln f\u00e4llt dann aber doch deutlich von der Apple Watch mit 368x448 Pixeln ab. Die geringere Aufl\u00f6sung macht sich in einigen Watchfaces und kleinen Schriften bemerkbar, die doch etwas verpixelt aussehen. Kaum ist die Schrift gr\u00f6\u00dfer, spielt das aber fast keine Rolle mehr. F\u00fcr einen Fitnesstracker v\u00f6llig OK, aber die Apple Watch ist da doch noch edler. Aufgrund des doch riesigen Preisunterschiedes (Apple verlangt \u00fcber das 6-fache), ziehe ich f\u00fcr die TOZO Watch keinen Stern ab.Fitnesstracker:Es sind sehr viele Sport-modus enthalten. Prinzipiell geht es darum, den ungef\u00e4hren kCal Verbrauch und nat\u00fcrlich die Anzahl und Zeit der Sessions zu tracken. Je nach Fitnessart gibt es dann weitere Ansichten wie Durchschnittsgeschwindigkeiten, Herzfrequenz und \u00e4hnliches. Mit dem richtigen Watchface sieht man auch, was man am Tag schon alles erreicht hat. Das funktioniert alles tip-top und die Detailauswertung schaut man sich dann auf'm Handy an.Man muss aber, z.B. beim Joggen oder Biken, immer das Handy dabei haben. Ohne Handy keine GPS Auswertung!Herzfrequenz:Misst absolut zuverl\u00e4ssig und genau (hab ich mit einer Stoppuhr gegengecheckt).Schlaftracker:Nettes Gimmick. Als ich mal nachts aufgewacht und aufgestanden bin, wurde das auch so angezeigt. Ob die REM und anderen Schlafphasen korrekt ausgewertet werden? Keine Ahnung. Und einen Einfluss habe ich darauf (au\u00dfer rechtzeitig ins Bett zu gehen) auch nicht.Koppelung:Erst die TOZO App runterladen, dann die Uhr \u00fcber die App koppeln (sagt einem die Uhr auch, wenn man sie zum ersten Mal \"anschaltet\". Funktionierte soweit problemlos.Anruffunktion:Eins meiner liebsten Features. Handy bleibt in der Hosentasche und man kann einen Anruf schnell beantworten. F\u00fchlt man sich fast wie Michael Knight in K.I.T.T. ;-) (die j\u00fcngeren unter uns werden sich jetzt denken: H\u00e4?) Ernsthaft, der Lautsprecher ist ausreichend laut, das Mikrofon nimmt ordentlich auf. Auch hier, alles OK.Messagefunktionen/ Notifications:Hier h\u00e4tte ich mir die Einrichtung etwas leichter vorgestellt. Musste die PopUps erstmal am Handy erlauben, dann klappte auch das. Aufgrund des geringen Displayaufl\u00f6sung nutze ich die PopUps aber nur als Benachrichtigung. Lesen/Antworten dann \u00fcbers Handy.Batterie:Ph\u00e4nomenal. Wenn man die Watch nur als Uhr benutzt, dann kommt man tats\u00e4chlich an die 10 Tage ran - nach 5 Tagen war der Akkustand knapp unter 50%. Aber in der Regel benutze ich sie beim Sport, dann muss sie nat\u00fcrlich \u00f6fter an das Ladekabel, was per Magnet an der Uhr gehalten wird. Ich sag mal, bei tats\u00e4chlicher Benutzung kommt man 3-4 Tage lang mit einer Ladung aus.FInal thoughts:Zus\u00e4tzliche Apps k\u00f6nnen keine installiert werden. Wirklich vermisst habe ich aber keine, und ohne eigenen Mobilfunkempfang hat man das Handy sowieso immer dabei - das handelt dann z.B. die Notifications.Sperren kann man die Watch nicht. Wenn man sie abnimmt, kann man trotzdem das Men\u00fc etc. \u00f6ffnen.Eine kontaktlose Bezahlfunktion ist nicht enthalten.Eine Anzeige von einem Boardingpass ist auch nicht m\u00f6glich - am Gate oder an der Sicherheitskontrolle hei\u00dft es dann, wieder das Smartphone zu z\u00fccken.Musik \u00fcber die Watch streamen? Nicht m\u00f6glich. (Musik wird \u00fcber das Handy gestreamt und mit der Watch kann man z.B. den Track skippen)Fazit:Wer prim\u00e4r einen Fitnesstracker und Uhr mit Ans\u00e4tzen einer SmartWatch sucht, ohne sich finanziell zu ruinieren, ist hier sehr gut aufgehoben. Alle Funktionen funktionieren reibungslos und ohne Aussetzer. Wer auf sein Handy zeitweise verzichten will (Sport, Bezahlen, P\u00e4sse anzeigen, Musik \u00fcber die Uhr h\u00f6ren), muss dann doch deutlich mehr Geld in die Hand nehmen, um gl\u00fccklich zu werden (Samsung, Apple: 360 Euro und aufw\u00e4rts!).",

                "reviewText": "I have upgraded from Tozo S2, which I already liked, and this one's even better - really happy with my purchase so far.I find the user interface on the watch itself very fast and responsive, no weird lag. There are multiple things you can track with this watch, most of them I don't really bother with but it's nice to have an option to track sleep quality, heart rate, etc. For everyday, it's mostly steps and distance I track.The app is decent, it allows you to choose from a variety of watch faces, though my only complaint is how I'd like to customize them, for example some faces don't have a step count where I'd like to add it, others have a lot of other info that I'd like to remove as it can look too busy. For the price point this is more than adequate though.Battery life is very good, only had to charge once per week so far.It is large enough and comfortable, I like the minimalist design, and the strap has a nice quality, not the tacky kind of silicone that catches every speck of dust and grime. It's a classic strap with a metal fastener, rather than the type where you push a little knob through, and while it may at first feel fiddly, I prefer this since there are a lot of holes with tiny spaces between, which means you can find the perfect setting for your wrist.Overall, would definitely recommend.",
