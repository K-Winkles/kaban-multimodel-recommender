The connection to my phone has stayed strong, the screen is bright, and the buzz on the alarm is strong enough to wake me up. It may not be a Samsung watch, but it does everything I need. The expensive watch I had needed to be charged almost every day and had features I didn\u2019t even use. This serves me perfectly to track sleep, steps, wake me up, and notify me of emails and calls since I leave my phone on silent all the time.",

                "reviewText": "I like the watch. Looks good and super comfortable band. Pairs easily with phone, and has lots of watch faces to choose from - many that I can read w/o my glasses. Accurately records my steps when exercising and doing daily activities. Movement reminder sometimes tells me to move when it am, but it consistently reminds me when it m not, so I'm ok with that. Alarm can wake me from a dead sleep. Only complaint is it doesn't measure sleep well. The times it has me going to sleep and waking up are often wrong. There are nights I get up and tend to family member for 10- 45 minutes that it doesn't show me as awake. I assume the other sleep info is off as well. Great as activity tracker, but pass if you're looking for accurate sleep info.",

This is much cheaper than other brands and does the same thing without the fear of breaking or losing a $100 product.Would buy it again!",
