                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great GPS watch and affordable",
                "reviewText": "I wanted one of those upscale GPS watches like from Garmin or Suunto. I had the Fitbit Ionic but it was glitchy, making it very unreliable. When I ran across this Amazon watch, it had all the bells and whistles I was looking for. I didn't have much info on the brand, but I took a leap and bought this watch.After months of usage on trails, I am happy to report this watch exceeded my expectations. Here's a couple bullet points:Battery life: let's be real, all manufacturers of GPS watches provide battery life at lowest settings. Battery life is more than fine. Don't need to go into the breakdown. I know what it's like for a watch to be hungry for juice constantly. This isn't one of them.Watch face: Vibrant colors. Readable face. I take it hiking in desert sun and can read it fine with sunglasses on. The only gripe one might have is the text size might be too small to read, but hey, this a large face compared to other smart watches.Comfort: Extremely light. Much, much lighter than non-smart watches. It never gets heavy even hours on trail. Strap is stretchy and there's a learning curve on adjustment. Sometimes it feels to have a nice grip on my wrist, when in fact it's sometimes too tight. A couple of days with the watch and you'll get the hang of getting optimal comfort and usage.Durability: I hike a lot, but I don't go bushwhacking. I can't say I have tested the abuse it can take. Can handle direct sunlight and water, but I don't know more beyond that.Fashion: It's a nice piece to wear. No more bulkier that a g-shock watch, which it's modeled after.Usage and Fuctionality: Out the box, it's easy to use. Found it easy to link up with the ZEPP app. Watch face is touch screen, and at times I had to use the buttons instead because of sweaty hands. I found that to be a great feature when active and on the go.Price Point: affordable and you definitely get bang for your buck. This smart watch will make you feel like a smart shopper.Room for Improvement:- the sleep monitor is not reliable, but might be because how I wear the watch.- text small. It's still a large watch face; can only do so much.- large menu. For some users, it would be a plus. For some it's convoluted.- more watch face customizations would be welcomeOverall: T-Rex Pro is a solid GPS watch. Reliable, durable, and user friendly are my biggest take aways. Pleasantly surprised how much better it was to my previous big brand product; Fitbit Ionic. I hike and it transfers stats to third party apps like Strava with ease. This is not a you-get-what-you-pay-for product. A plethora of options and functions makes this watch feel like a steal at the low price point. At this point, I am not shopping around for new watches. I'm getting exactly what I want from this one and darn happy with it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Not overcomplicated, and for a guy who just wants a nice-looking and capable watch; this is it",
                "reviewText": "Ok, not a super in-depth review on an extremely capable watch here, but after two months of use, here's the review.It's awesome.I had a Luminox Recon (non-smart watch) for 10 years that I literally NEVER took off. Lost it in a lake because bands really never stayed on that well. So, with a wristwatch literally being an extension of my personality and my \"look\"; I stressed the hell out. I didn't want to jump on the smartwatch bandwagon and just wanted a simple good looking and tough watch to glance at the time, time my workouts, and let me know what date it was without costing me over $300. Couldn't find one that I thought was worth the price of admission. I purchased a couple of watches (Amazfit T-Rex Pro and a Suunto watch) to try out for a couple weeks and hopefully decide on one. The T-Rex Pro won.There's waaaaay more capabilities here with this watch than I've even delved into, but the things I love about it are as follows:1) Looks - this thing looks baddass. Not too big or small on my wrist. I was, surprisingly, able to find a watch face that I loved and looked extremely similar to my Luminox. Yeah, it cost an additional $1.99 in the app store, but awesome!2) Sturdy - I've knocked it around a bit since I never take it off, and it is holding up better than I thought so far. No scratches or dings (buy yourself a screen protector anyway). I especially like how the pin that holds the watch band on is a \"through-design\" pin instead of a compression pin. These pins on the T-rex are screwed on, so I don't have to worry about the watch band falling off again unless the rubber band itself breaks or deteriorates. Also the single band keeper that holds the tail of the unused band is great; it has a ridge in it that sinks into the watch band adjustment hole so that it stays in place and holds the tail of the band securely.3) Comfort - more comfortable than my Luminox rubber wrist band. This wrist band has way more holes for adjustment which I appreciate and the band is a bit stretchy/flexible. It actually feels good on my wrist.4) Capabilities - I track my workouts, and it's super awesome that the watch now tells me what my heart rate is within fat burning/aerobic/anaerobic levels when doing so. Super cool. It also has great tracking abilities with the limited amount I have used them (sleep for instance). It's actually helped me with either picking up or dropping my intensity of workouts in a positive manner. I only have to charge the watch every 7 days; and it takes just a little more over only 1 hour to fully charge the watch. So good! My wife is so mad her Samsung watch basically needs to be charged every single day.5) App - the app is cool and informative and comprehensive. One complaint is that for the weather info to show up on my watch face I have to connect the watch to the app. For whatever reason, the weather info stops showing up on the watch face eventually though and I'll have to open the app up again and connect. Not sure if it loses connection or what; seems weird that it stops relaying data to the watch for weather.Overall, with the limited functionality I use this watch for, I'm way more pleasantly surprised and happy with this watch than I thought I would be as an old-skool analog watch user who fought getting with the times and switching out. Love it.",
