                "reviewText": "I am a hardcore Garmin fan. I have had various Garmin watches for over 10 years. My current is Garmin Venu 2. I can honestly say this watch is equal to, if not better in regards to data and features! In addition to tracking activities, it can be connected to music, used as a trigger for one's phone camera, has a calculator, calendar, business card links to websites, measures blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels, on and on! It was super easy to install the app on my phone and pair it with the watch. I have had more difficulty with my Garmin. It's also easy to sync data with the app. The app is user friendly and easy to navigate. One of the reasons I love Garmin is that their Connect App is so great for data tracking. This app is fairly comparable. The watch itself is also a cinch to navigate.Another selling point is that is is a sleek looking watch! I like the magnetic watchband...allowing it to be adjusted to the perfect size. It isn't waterproof, which is unfortunate...but I don't do water sports anyways. Just need to remember to take it off before jumping in the shower or swimming. One feature that is a little peculiar is the magnetic charge connector, instead of a plug in, but that is hardly a criticism...I just haven't experienced such a way to charge and it worked quite nicely!Unfortunately, I haven't contrasted my personal data between the two brands, nor have I really had a chance to see how long the battery lasts before needing recharged. However, as is...I am completely sold, especially because the price is so amazing for all these features! My venu was well over $200 and it doesn't have all these features!! Seriously, this is worth the price! I was looking into buying a new Garmin...I may have already found the replacement!",

                "reviewText": "One of the classiest looking smart watches I've seen. The watch band is metal and has a magnetic clasp so it fits wrists of all sizes even really small ones like my 15 year old daughter. There are a lot of options and apps pre-loaded on it including all of the fitness apps you'd expect, text, phone calls music controls, etc. The watch itself is light and feels like it's made of plastic, but it works really well, and the touch screen is responsive. It requires downloading a free app that requires registration with an email address in order to pair. Overall this is a really good smart watch and it's a great price, but there are a few odd things that don't make or break anything, but wanted to disclose:As far as the odd things:1. There's no way that I can find to adjust the time if it's not paired with a phone. So for anyone just wanting a watch for fitness tracking without connecting it to your phone, you can't set the time to what it should be and there wasn't any options to connect just the watch to wi-fi for it to get updates.2. The dial does turn, but that doesn't control anything like scrolling.3. There is one single button that goes to the app screen meaning there's no \"back\" button if you're a few clicks into an app you can't go backwards one screen...you just have to go back to the main app list and start over.4. I can't figure out why they made this design decision, but the end of the button is a glossy dark green...not a big deal, but it looks a little odd on an otherwise classy looking watch (see the last picture)5. The pairing app requires you to register an account and won't let you move forward unless you enter birthday, gender, height (in cm only) and weight (in kg only). You can reset units to imperial after the fact, but you have to google height in cm and weight in kg at the start.Overal I would recommend it...a watch band like this for an apple or android watch usually costs twice as much as this entire watch!",
