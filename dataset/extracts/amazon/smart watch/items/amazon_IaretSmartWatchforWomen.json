You can both receive and make calls with the inbuilt dialpad. Speakerphone is loud and clear. You can play music. You get notifications from Whatsapp, Google / Android text messages, Facebook on the phone and you can read it. Lots of dial faces to choose from. You can use your own pictures also as the dial face. The protective covers are easily available and not pricey. Pulse, SPO\u00b2 and other health tracking features are also available. Haven't checked the accuracy of those readings. Overall a very good purchase. Infact I ended up purchasing another one because I liked it. App features and phone connectivity are also top notch.Only feature that I wish it had was the ability to send messages as well instead of just being able to read your incoming messages. That would have made this watch just awesome. Either or, it was a great purchase for me both times. The seller also follows up via email after each purchase. Kudos for that.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this watch mainly for sleep tracking, I knew it wasn't going to be super accurate as it's cheap, but the sleep times are locked to a \"normal\" night time sleep window. I have insomnia and wanted to see how much sleep I was getting, I look at the watch past 10pm and it says I'm asleep when I'm awake. I slept for about 3.5 hours the second night I had it on and it recorded over 9hours.Bluetooth connection drops if you're more than a few feet from your phone, so you're not going to get those calls or notifications. Defeats the purpose of the bluetooth if you don't want to have to bring your phone everywhere. Want to leave your phone on a close table while you're getting dirty? Not going to be able to answer the phone call on the watch.You can only add up to 8 contacts to the watch but they constantly disappear. It took me an hour to figure out that I had to go into my phone and add a country code (+1) to every contact I wanted to add or it won't show up to add in the app.DaFit app is the only way to connect this watch to your phone, it's seriously lacking. You cannot edit anything. You cannot adjust sleep recorded. You can only add one customized watch face and can't delete the 3 preloaded ones.Another watch I bought on the cheap orange shopping app for about $12 had many more features and functions and used the HryFine app that is worlds ahead of this one, I only bought this one because my last smartwatch one broke.Only positive things I have to say is that the battery life is decent, I had it on for around 48 hours from the time I set up and charged it until I gave up on the DaFit app and put it back in the box a day ago and the battery is at 74% when leaving the watch face setting to off unless turned on by the side button. It seems to be built pretty solidly, the watch straps are ok, it came with a metal one and a silicone one.I will be returning this watch. Wish I would have looked at the Amazon and DaFit app reviews before wasting my time.",

I bought it mainly to track my steps but I am finding myself using all the features of the watch. It was easily paired with my phone and works well! I especially love the heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor. You can\u2019t beat it for the price! The only thing that I would change is the sensitivity of the watch when changing screens. Sometimes the screen switches when I do not intend it to. I am not 100% sure if I can adjust this (I will find out) a very minor issue that I certainly can live with! Great value for the price! I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I initially got a cheapo cheapo smart watch that cost about $15, to see if I would even like one. And I found out that I did. I use it mostly for the sleep, steps, time, certain notifications, and stopwatch.So I upgraded to this one and it looks better. Silver metal band. But the battery dies out after 2 days.And I am not sure if the steps are accurate, as I was in a zoom meeting and by the end of it had added 600 steps to my daily total when I didn't move from my chair (sometimes there is a delay in updating the step counter, so it could have been that, as well, I just don't know).And sleep. The cheapo one I had initially showed the times I got up to go to the bathroom or took my dog out to go potty. This one doesn't.So how accurate is it? I don't know. I want one that's accurate because I am on a sleep protocol and for the first time in my 48 years of life, am sleeping 8+ hours per night! It is a game changer for me, so being able to track my sleep helps me feel like I am giving myself gold stars. hah!",
