                "reviewText": "I bought the smart watch mainly because of its blood oxygen feature, needless to say how important to know the blood oxygen level during covid-19 pandemicSetup process went smoothly (download app, set up profile, pair the watch and the phone) thanks to the very informative email about the watch I received even before the watch was delivered.Basics:24/7 continuously measures heart rate, stress level, monitor sleep, count steps, calculate working distance.14 exercise modes such as indoor/outdoor walk/run/swim meet most people\u2019s need, ball games are not included.Notification and Auto On are handy:Notifications from supported phone apps (email, instant messaging apps) are kept on the watch when they are received. It is convenient to read the short ones.Lift wrist up the watch face will be turned on briefly (adjustable), giving enough time to read info or swift to navigate to other featuresNote, Notification comes with vibration, you CANT miss the call/email/message/alarm/reminder. You can not turn the vibrate off unless notification is off. Best to set up regular do-not-disturb schedule on phone app and to easily toggle the do-not-disturb switch on the watch for other situations, On the watch You can only reject the incoming phone call you still have to use the phone to answer the call.Battery life:In my typical use the watch needs to charge once a week. (Notification is On, Auto Display is On, no Do-not-disturb schedule is set)I found setting Notification and Auto Display both off can greatly increase the battery life to last up to 3 weeksPhone app collects all measured data and exercise records and generate reports. With just $40 I get my body watched, get to know my health better, get encouraged to do more exercise to reach set goal, it is a good buy.There is a little annoying the bluetooth connection can drop sometimes although I always keep the watch and the phone nearby. It does not happen too often. When it happened, I need to try several times to get them paired again.",
