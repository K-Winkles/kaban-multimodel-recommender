I was a little nervous at first it being used and all but As a savvy shopper, getting this pre-owned gem at half the cost was a steal, especially when it performs as if it's brand new. Not a scratch to be seen, it's a testament to the durability and quality of Samsung's craftsmanship.Navigating its features feels intuitive and seamless, from the comprehensive fitness tracking to the standout sleep monitoring that has given me insightful data to improve my sleep quality. The updates promised by Samsung until 2026 assure me that my watch will stay current with the latest tech advancements.The Galaxy Watch 4 isn't just a smartwatch; it's a personal assistant, health guru, and a stylish accessory all wrapped around my wrist. If you're considering a smartwatch that balances aesthetics, functionality, and future-readiness, this is the one to watch!",

Works perfect and very classy looking. 46mm size was a concern but it is light and I don't notice it even though I haven't worn a watch in years. Battery life is good and syncs fast and easy with my Sansung Flip 4 phone. Awesome and love it.",

The watch came completely dead and I had to play around with the charger to get it to start charging. It staid at 0%. I tried a few different power blocks and it started charging. It came with possibly a bad power block. After it charged it powered right up. You use the Galaxy wearable app on your Android to sync the watch with bluetooth. It has all the apps that I use on apple watch a ton like Strava and Shazam. FYI it does not see to have a heart rate app that is native. I tried using the Samsung health app but it's not compatible unless you have Samsung phone. I found a few other apps and it works fine and the heart rate also works with Strava. Overall the watch looks great and has some cool faces. Apple watch is cool and smaller, but the Galaxy watch looks a lot better.",

                "reviewText": "When I finally received the watch, I immediately placed it on the charging station. After reaching 100% charge, I removed it from the station and went to sleep. The next morning, I woke up to an alarm indicating a low battery, despite it being at full charge the night before. Surprisingly, the device drained completely in about 6 hours while sitting idle on the table all night. Additionally, there are a couple of scratches on the face, barely noticeable up close. I had expected something closer to a brand-new condition when I ordered a watch listed as 'EXCELLENT CONDITION'.What frustrated me further was discovering similar complaints in the comments section. Someone reported the exact battery issue I encountered about 14 days before my purchase. Moreover, I noticed a trend: more positive reviews from those who bought devices in good condition rather than those listed as excellent.Overall, this was a disappointing experience. I strongly advise considering spending a bit more for a brand-new item, as there's no assurance that if I return this watch, the next recipient won't face similar issues.",

                "reviewText": "Over the past 5 years I had many smart watches and was never satisfied with any of them. This is the best so far! The first thing I like is it uses Wear OS instead of a proprietary software. I am able to use many more apps and add watch faces I like. I bought the watch for a \"health\" watch more than a \"fitness\" watch. I wanted the features of the blood oxygen, heart rate, ECG and such. I had other watches and the blood oxygen never was accurate but this one is. Of course, another advantage of the watch is it so popular there are so many accessories available at low cost. I have several bands and covers so I can change the entire look of the watch when I feel like it. The battery life is typical of smart watches. For me it is pretty much a day, but recharging is fast, and the charger is easy. I would suggest an extension cable and optional \"cradle\". Before this watch I bought the Moto watch 100 as it had great battery life but hated it. The software was terrible, and the blood oxygen test was useless. My main complaint is the software. It works really well but there is no way to generate any decent kind of report. I like to send my doctor and that is available is some cheesy PNG graphs. I am told I can link it to MyChart which many hospitals including mine, but you must get the doctor to approve it. I am waiting to see if this works. All in all, I am very happy. I like the look of the watch and for my larger wrist the 46mm looks good and gives me good view. The notifications work great and there are many ways to customize. This was a \"refurbished\" watch and as far as I am concerned it is new. There were no flaws and seems to function just great. I don't need fancy packaging and the cost savings was a blessing. I am a happy camper!",
