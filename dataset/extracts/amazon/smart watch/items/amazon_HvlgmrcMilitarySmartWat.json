I set my watch to off when I raise my arm. No need to have it come on if I'm just doing normal ROM. So, that info could help with your battery longevity. Overall, why pay more for the big names?

                "reviewText": "I just bought this mainly because my girlfriend and I started walking for exercise. She bought herself an slim activity tracker and was enjoying hers. It made me want one but I wanted something with some more personality then I saw this one. I read the reviews of this and many others and decided to order this. The first thing I noticed was the size of the face easily readable but not tacky. Then I noticed the comfort the band is stretchy making it hardly noticeable that you're wearing it. It makes our long walks even more enjoyable and we complete with our steps etc. I definitely recommend this product if you're looking for an inexpensive way to follow your progress as to aim for better health.",

All functions like heart rate, blood oxygen, and stress seem accurate at initial setup. Time and real life environment shall tell the endurance and durability. The call and media audio functions are very good ease of use to toggle on and off and calls are crisp and clear on both ends.",
