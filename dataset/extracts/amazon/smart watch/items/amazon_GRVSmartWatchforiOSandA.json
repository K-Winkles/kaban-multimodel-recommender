                "reviewText": "I was looking for an inexpensive watch to track my steps (heart rate/O2 are a bonus), this works great for that! It says it starts counting after 10 steps during 'awake' hours and 20 steps during 'sleeping' hours. I thought I walked way more than I actually did according to this watch. It is pretty accurate as I have counted my steps and checked the watch and they are within a couple steps. It tracks your heart rate and your O2 levels and saves the history in the app. It's nice to have that info at the push of a button instead of writing it all down (and misplacing the sheet of paper). I have mine set up to take my heart rate and O2 levels once an hour so I can see how I'm doing anytime I want. Great information to have for my next annual Dr appointment. It alerts me to get up and move if I haven't done so in 1 hour (vibrates 3 times and shows on the screen to get up and move). It also allowed me to set up an alert if my heart rate goes above a certain number that I have entered. Took me a while to figure out why it vibrated 5 times with nothing on the screen, that's your warning that your heart rate is above that set number you entered. The sleep tracker works fairly good, sometimes it says I have 'rapid eye movement' after I have woke up so that could use a little tweaking but overall, it does a pretty good job tracking your sleep. Tells you when you are in deep sleep, light sleep, rapid eye movement and awake. There are a lot of options to set up through the app, I don't think I'm using it to it's full potential but it works great for what I wanted. It connects to your phone via bluetooth so it rings when your phone rings, you get to see the text on your watch (I haven't figured out how to text back from the watch but I just grab my phone for the bigger screen to text anyways), it shows you emails that you receive, shows notifications from Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, etc. You can pick which apps you want notifications for through the app on your phone. I have not worn it in the shower to see if it's water proof, I take all jewelry off anyways, it seems fine when I wash my hands and splash it with a little water, never has it been submerged in water. The watch band is a little irritating if you get water/sweat behind it. Because you need it somewhat tight on your wrist for accurate readings, water/sweat can irritate your skin under the band, no worries, take it off and wipe the water/sweat off the watch, band and your wrist and it's fine. Battery life is actually better than I thought it would be, it gets down to about 25% after about 5-6 days. I charge it while I'm at work, I'm sitting at my desk anyways so I don't have to worry about missed steps or not tracking my sleep. Haven't timed a charge but I'd say it's around 1 - 1 1/2 hours to fully charge it. It does still vibrate if you get a text, call, email or other notification, however, when you tap the side button to wake it up, all you see is the charging status, you cannot see the notification. Overall, I highly recommend this watch if you are looking for a 'smart watch' but without the smart watch price and its own line on your phone plan. I have a Nord phone (same as Samsung only WAY cheaper), Android operating system, and this works just fine with my phone, no issues at all!! Highly, HIGHLY recommend this watch!!!!",

The 1st one broke from a freak accident involving a car and the driveway\u2026 This smart watch is not an Apple Watch by any means; however, it works great for steps, sleep, heart rate, and reminding you to move! It is not a 2 way communication device as it only receives alerts of a text message or call - it does not take pictures or allow you to send messages out and you can\u2019t talk into it\u2026 but as a 1 way communication device - it is sleek and easy to switch out the bands to different styles and colors. The display is easy to use and the battery life is AWESOME!! The app for your phone is easy to use and link up with the watch as well. I had to charge it every 3 days. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",

It worked well, I liked the connection with my phone. The app is definitely less than desirable, but if you want a watch that will accurately count steps, show texts, track sleep, etc, it was great. It lasted for 10 months. Compared to the price of other smart watches, I still count that as a win. I actually just replaced this with a different cheap smart watch, but I liked this one better, so I think I'll return the other and repurchase this one. Compared to the other one I bought, this one is very easy to use, tracks steps/sleep/exercise more accurately, and you can program what time of night you'd like the screen to automatically dim. My other watch is so bright when I roll over at night that is driving me crazy.",

The battery life is great. For my girls that like pink, this watch is it! I give it 5 stars for all of that. BUT this watch does NOT sync with my health apps (I use Samsung health and Google fit). I've had the watch for 2 weeks and unpaired and re-paired, gone thru every single feature and setting on this thing - there's no way to pair it. I bought this watch for the sole purpose of tracking my activity to sync with my health apps. And because it doesn't, I will be returning this.If the syncing part isn't a big thing for you, then I highly recommend this purchase. It's a lot of bang for your buck, and it's a cute watch!

Die Genauigkeit der Herzfrequenzmessung ist beeindruckend und liefert zuverl\u00e4ssige Daten w\u00e4hrend meiner Aktivit\u00e4ten.Der integrierte Schrittz\u00e4hler motiviert mich, meine t\u00e4glichen Bewegungsziele zu erreichen, indem er meine Schritte pr\u00e4zise z\u00e4hlt und mir hilft, aktiv zu bleiben. Ebenso \u00fcberwacht der Schlafmonitor meine Schlafqualit\u00e4t und liefert wertvolle Einblicke in meine n\u00e4chtlichen Ruhephasen.Die Smartwatch bietet auch neun verschiedene Trainingsmodi, darunter Laufen, Radfahren und Yoga, um meine Workouts zu diversifizieren und meine Fortschritte zu verfolgen. Diese Vielseitigkeit erm\u00f6glicht es mir, meine Fitnessziele individuell anzupassen und meine Trainingsroutine zu optimieren.Die Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che der Smartwatch ist benutzerfreundlich und intuitiv, und das Display ist klar und gut lesbar, auch bei direkter Sonneneinstrahlung. Die Batterielaufzeit ist ebenfalls beeindruckend, und ich kann die Smartwatch problemlos mehrere Tage lang nutzen, bevor sie aufgeladen werden muss.Insgesamt bin ich \u00e4u\u00dferst zufrieden mit der GRV Smartwatch. Sie bietet eine umfassende Palette an Fitness- und Gesundheitsfunktionen in einem stilvollen und benutzerfreundlichen Design. Ich kann sie jedem empfehlen, der nach einer zuverl\u00e4ssigen und funktionalen Smartwatch sucht, um seine Gesundheit und Fitness zu verbessern.",

Ich benutze die GRV Smartwatch FC1 nun schon seit einigen Wochen und sie ist wirklich ein zuverl\u00e4ssiger Begleiter bei meinen t\u00e4glichen Aktivit\u00e4ten geworden. Das moderne Design der Uhr, vor allem in der Farbvariante Green Gold, verleiht meinem Stil einen schicken Touch, und ihr geringes Gewicht sorgt den ganzen Tag \u00fcber f\u00fcr Komfort, ohne einzuschr\u00e4nken. Das TFT-LCD-Farbdisplay zeigt ein lebendiges Bild und erleichtert den Zugriff auf die zahlreichen Funktionen dieser Smartwatch.Die Verbindung mit der GloryFit-App war schnell und problemlos und erm\u00f6glicht den Zugriff auf eine breite Palette von Funktionen auf dem gro\u00dfen Display. Mit \u00fcber 100 Multi-Trainingsmodi, Herzfrequenzmessung, SpO2-Tracking und Menstruationsvorhersage deckt diese Smartwatch alle Aspekte von Gesundheit und Fitness ab. Die 9 Sportmodi, darunter Laufen, Walken und Yoga, sind auf die verschiedenen Trainingsvorlieben abgestimmt.Die Akkulaufzeit ist beeindruckend: Sie betr\u00e4gt etwa 7-10 Tage bei einer kurzen Ladezeit von 2,5 Stunden. W\u00e4hrend einige Nutzer Ungenauigkeiten bei der Schrittz\u00e4hlung bem\u00e4ngelten, empfand ich die Werte bei meinen t\u00e4glichen Aktivit\u00e4ten als realistisch. Auch die Schlaf\u00fcberwachung wird von der Uhr gut gehandhabt und liefert wertvolle Einblicke in mein Schlafverhalten.Trotz einiger kleinerer Nachteile, die von anderen Nutzern erw\u00e4hnt wurden, wie z. B. die kleine Schriftgr\u00f6\u00dfe f\u00fcr Benachrichtigungen und die etwas komplizierte Einstellfunktion f\u00fcr das Zifferblatt, bin ich insgesamt mit der Leistung der Uhr zufrieden, insbesondere angesichts des g\u00fcnstigen Preises. Insgesamt hat die GRV Smartwatch FC1 meine Erwartungen an ein preiswertes Ger\u00e4t \u00fcbertroffen, denn sie bietet ein elegantes Design, zuverl\u00e4ssige Funktionen und einen hohen Tragekomfort. Empfehlenswert!",
