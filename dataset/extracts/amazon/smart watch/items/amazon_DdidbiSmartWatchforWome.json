                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Smartwatch You\u2019ll Find Under $40",
                "reviewText": "In short, in my limited experience this seems to be the best smartwatch you will find under $40. What sets this watch above the rest are ease navigation/ use, very useful watch faces, fairly accurate biometrics, and an ability to hold 100 phone numbers. Things that could be better are: the display resolution, music control/ information, and the need for dual Bluetooth connections to make calls.I never owned a smart watch. This was my first and I bought it because it was one of the most purchased and best reviewed smart watches on Amazon. Since then I have tried others, and while each may be better in one or two ways, this seems to be the best overall at this price point.Packaging was simple in a slim cardboard box. It came with the watch, a charger, an extra strap and instructions. The watch needed some charging, for about two hours, before use.The watch requires the \u201cGloryfit\u201d app on you phone. So far, the app and the watch have worked. Through the app you can sinc 100 contacts, change weather and biometric data from metric to imperial units as well as log activity much like you can on the watch. Addition watch faces are available for download via the app as well.The watch itself has five standard faces plus one or two downloadable faces and five themes to arrange the apps. I have to say while the standard faces aren\u2019t the most artistic, at least a couple present all the health and date/ time information you\u2019d want on a single face. The watch will hold a charge for 7-14 days, though that depends on use. The watch is water resistant to the IP68 standard, which is enough to handle water sprays, but submersion is not recommended. So far I have not had issues with water intrusion during hand washing and cleaning. I have not swam or showered with the watch on, nor do I plan to do so.The watch health features include a heart rate monitor, step monitor, distance monitor using your phones GPS. I believe it uses the step/ distance to calculate calories burned each day. The watch has a blood O2 monitor that when activated takes a minute to read your blood O2. There is a sleep monitor that somehow monitors and calculates deep sleep and light sleep. The pulse, step/ distance monitor all seem to be accurate. I have no way to know if the O2 monitor is accurate and the sleep monitor is a bit hit and miss on me. Some nights it\u2019s accurate (I think). Other nights it doesn\u2019t register any sleep for me, though in fairness I am a light sleeper and I wake several times a night.The watch also displays the current weather or at least temperature in degrees Celsius but you can change it to Fahrenheit in the app. If you scroll down from the weather display, you will also see the six or seven day forecast.The music player is limited to play/ pause and track skipping forward and backwards. The song playing does not transmit to the watch or at least it is not shown. And honestly, this is my one of few complaints about the watch.You can make calls from the watch and the microphone and speaker are surprisingly good. My calls were clear and the other parties had no idea I was using a watch. Making or answering calls does require a connection both through the app and Bluetooth (or a double Bluetooth connection) If you lose the Bluetooth connection, you will not be able to answer calls from the watch. I found the easiest way to reconnect Bluetooth if it is disconnected is to simply power cycle the watch. Contacts do appear for / on calls, but only if they are on your 100 contacts that you can sinc in the app.The watch also receives texts. Again, you only see the sender\u2019s name if they are in your watch\u2019s contacts. You can\u2019t type a text response, but I\u2019m not sure who would want to on a watch. Notifications from Facebook or what\u2019s App the other hand actually always show the sender.Overall the watch has nice features for the price. But the ease of use, intuitive menu and functions, ability to hold 100 phone numbers, and accurate bio data set this watch apart from other watches at this price point. I do wish the music functionality was better and I could see the song playing on my phone. I also would appreciate a better screen resolution and a one-click connection. Still given the functionality and execution of the features you do have, this is the best smartwatch you will find under $40. Five stars.",

Once I figured it all out, I have to say I'm satisfied. Especially for the price compared to others. If your older and aren't used to dealing tech, you may want a grandkid to help. 2 reasons for 4 star review and not 5. 1. 5 stars means that it is amazing and excedeeds expectations, which it doesn't do. 2. I received a solicitation about a month later offering me $30 if I gave it 5 stars. Some people would say I'm a fool for not taking the $30 but I don't care what those people think. This is my 1st smart watch so I have nothing to compare it to. It is a handy watch once you get used to it.",

                "reviewText": "Everything sounded just like what I wanted and there were good reviews. But when it arrived the manual was totally useless. I loaded the Ap so the watch could connect to my phone and the Ap would never respond to me. I reloaded the Ap twice with the same results. So if the phone couldn't connect to the Ap then it was also useless. I gave up and sent it back.UPDATE REVIEW - After posting the above review, I received a message expressing the company's concern for my problems. I was offered three choices for making good on the watch. I chose to give them one more chance and was promised a new watch to be sent ASAP. I was surprised to receive the new watch in three days and upon setting it up, it went very smoothly. I am now very impressed with the watch. The only reason I now give it 4 stars is because some of the communications between me and the company were written in Chinese ! Once the language barrier was corrected things went well.SECOND UPDATE: UNTIL I wore it for a month trying to give it every chance to prove itself. It would not stay connected to the ap. It would not sync to most of the functions. Its only saving feature was it did tell the time and date....that's all ! I sent the first one back and the company sent me a replacement. So this second is even worse than the first after one month of continuous attempts to make it work. I have thrown the second one into the trash and have learned a valuable lesson; YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. Save yourself the trouble look elsewhere (USA).",

                "reviewText": "This is my first smart watch and I have to say it is a lot nicer than expected for the price. I like being able to track my heart rate and steps, along with sleep time, etc. It's also nice to be able to have my text messages show up on the watch, but the font size is a little small to read and I don't see a way to adjust that in the watch settings. Battery life is pretty good, I usually only have to charge it once a week and the charging process is pretty fast. The rubber wrist bands were not a good fit for me, but I was able to find other stretchy band options to fit it.",

Lo tengo todo desactivado pq al sincronizarlo con la app (Glory Fit) esta todo el rato vibrando ya sea por notificaciones o por llamadas y la bateria dura menos. Por tanto cada vez que quiero q se encienda la pantalla le doy al boton y asi la bateria dura 5-7 dias. El cargador va con unos imanes que vienen algo flojos pues me lo he llevado dentro del neceser de viaje y han llegado fuera de su sitio. Consult\u00e9 comprar el cargador solo y me contestaron que en un futuro si lo venderian suelto La car\u00e1tula de la pantalla se cambia desde la app de modo super facil y hay un pont\u00f3n de opciones. La relacion calidad - precio la creo excelente y asequible a muchos bolsillos. Resistente duradero y se me moja al lavarme las manos o al lavar platos por debajo y no da problemas. Para una ducha me lo quito eso si! Le he dado golpes o ralladuras con paredes granulas y no le pasa nada ...MUY SATISFECHO !!",
