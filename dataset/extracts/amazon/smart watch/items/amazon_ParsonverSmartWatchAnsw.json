Text messages go through, you can\u2019t reply but it\u2019s nice to get the notification and a quick look. Pretty accurate sleep tracker, my son wakes me up throughout the night and the awake times on the watch are spot on. Easy to use and looks sharp. Awesome battery\u2019s life so far, I\u2019ve had it almost a month and have charged it once. The alarm feature is great too, multiple alarms can be set with a 10 minute snooze and it vibrates so it\u2019s a much gentler wake up. Very happy with it and can\u2019t be mad at the price",

                "reviewText": "This is my first smart watch, but I generally like it. It's large but relatively thin which is a must for me. It seems to do the basics very well. I mostly bought it to monitor my activity levels and sleep which it seems to do fine. I also am beginning to appreciate receiving calls and messages on my wrist without pulling the phone from my pocket. The battery goes several days without charging and it is easily and fairly quickly charged. The app to my smart phone is considered by my phone to be a high intensity app and does drain my battery a little more than normal. However, it knocks my battery life from 4 days to 3 days, so I am not too worried about this aspect. My main annoyance is with the band. It is a basic silicon band which is not uncomfortable, but I wouldn't list as being really comfortable. It just seems to slide around a little and hasn't gotten to where I don't think about having it on. So, I have ordered a different (cloth) band and hope that changes things. For the money, I am pleased with the purchase for a starter watch.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a quick fix to the problem of my samsung watch breaking, so I got this basic watch. Got it 3 months ago. There is nothing special about it, does the basics. I really just needed something to alert me when my phone was, and by who, was calling and texting since I cannot have my phone on me all day. It served it's purpose for about 2 months. Then the notifications for texts quit working and then calls shortly after. So needless to say it was just kept for time at this point. Then 2 days ago it quit working all together. Shut off and won't turn back on.So long story short you get what you pay for. And I bought a 55 watch. I didn't even get what I needed for more then a couple months but honestly what was I expecting.My advice, if you need a watch quick that does the basics in the interim of purchasing the one you want just go get a basic watch from Target or Walmart and save some money for what you actually want.",

Ich hatte bedenken \u00fcber die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und wuchtigkeit der Uhr.Bei 13cm Umfang des armes kann die Uhr im hintersten Loch eingestellt werden (wesentlich weniger ist dann nicht mehr m\u00f6glich. Ist aber normal nicht n\u00f6tig, da gleichaltrige Kinder einen wesentlich dickeren Umfang haben als 13cm)Wir haben die Uhr heute in Betrieb genommen und das telefonieren funktioniert. Auch Puls und Schritte werden gemessen. Mehr kann ich noch nicht sagen.Design gef\u00e4llt auch.",
