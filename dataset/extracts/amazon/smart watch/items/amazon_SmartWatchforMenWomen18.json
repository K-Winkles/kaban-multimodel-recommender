                "reviewText": "Pros:- Sleek and stylish design- Bluetooth pairing works very well, including easy setup- Calls are crystal clear- Lots of useful functions- Accurate pedometer- Accurate heart rate reading- Long battery life (I\u2019ve worn it for 36 hours straight and have completed 2 long workouts in that time and the battery is at 56%. This would never be possible with an Apple Watch.)Cons:- Grossly inaccurate measurement of calorie burn- Does not track total active minutesOverall the watch has an impressive number of features, an intuitive user interface, and extremely long battery life compared to the Apple Watch. If you don\u2019t care about measurement of calories burned or tracking active minutes, this is a fantastic watch for the price.I\u2019m returning it and going back to my Apple Watch solely because I want accurate calorie burn and a display of active minutes. I\u2019m bummed though because my Apple Watch battery is usually dead after 18 hours so I have to charge it every night, and therefore can\u2019t wear it for tracking sleep patterns.",

                "reviewText": "I was first attracted to this because of the cost. We all know what the world famous smart watch costs.. and I dont need all the functions and apps .. I am looking to watch my heart rate , count steps and if available watch my OX level..This watch does so much more - however the core functions that I need, and obviously a watch are all in a package under $25.00. Ig you are looking for an Apple, or Samsung smartwatch - and the price tag that goes along with it fine, however if you only need a subset of the applications at a subset of the price congratulations you have found a great alternative.I have tried my hardest to give this a great wear test and the strap is made of a silicone like material that does not make me sweat, and is strong enough for normal use, The watch charges and syncs with your phone like those \"others\" so for my money this is a great functional watch..They always say think twice and buy only what you need.. This covers so many bases that I cannot see how it wouldn't be a serious contender for anyone looking to buy a smartwatch. Here are some of my more technical thoughts based on functionality..Sleek Design and Build:The sleek and stylish design and the white color and the IP68 waterproof feature ensures durability, making it suitable for various activities, from workouts to everyday wear.Versatile Calling and Messaging:The ability to answer and make calls directly from the smartwatch is cool. It brings convenience, especially when my phone is not readily accessible. The seamless integration with Android and iOS devices ensures compatibility for all users.lots of Sport Modes and Fitness Tracking:With over 100 sport modes, this smartwatch caters to every fitness enthusiast's needs. The precision in tracking various activities, coupled with the heart rate monitor, sleep monitor, and pedometer, provides a comprehensive overview of my healthIntuitive User Interface:Navigating through the smartwatch is a breeze thanks to its user-friendly interface. The 1.85\" display is vibrant and responsive, enhancing the overall user experience. The clear visuals make it easy to check notifications, track fitness progress,Long Battery Life:Even with frequent use and continuous heart rate monitoring, the smartwatch maintains a long-lasting charge, eliminating the need for constant recharging.Comprehensive Health Monitoring:The smartwatch goes beyond basic fitness tracking. The heart rate monitor provides real-time data, and the sleep monitor offers valuable insights into my sleep patterns.Seamless Compatibility and App Integration:Connecting the smartwatch to my Android device was seamless, and the integration with various apps enhances its usefulness.Jam packed with features at a price that cant be beat...",

It took some work to get set up, but despite all the features it was not overly difficult. Some were basic things like changing the time to 12 hour vs. 24 hour, weather degrees from Centigrade to Fahrenheit, centimeters to inches and kg to lbs. I just had to find where to make those changes. Connecting to my phone was easy. The face is large and bright and there are many different looks to choose from. The band is soft and comfortable. Still working with the app. I am very happy with my new smart watch and I hope it will last a long while. Hopefully longer than my previous one!",

Als ich den Preis sah habe ich mir nicht all zu viel Hoffnung gemacht jedoch die Uhr hat meine Erwartungen \u00fcbertroffen!Die Qualit\u00e4t, die vielen Funktionen und das Design sind perfekt! Die Beschreibung und Installation sind super einfach.Die Uhr ist au\u00dferdem auch super einafach zum Handhaben und auch sehr angenehm zum Tragen.Der Akku h\u00e4lt ca. 10 Tage.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt f\u00fcr die Uhr ist - ein personalisierbarer Hintergrund (eigenes Foto z.B.).Fazit: Der Preis ist mehr als super f\u00fcr die vielen Funktionen die die Uhr bietet!Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung!",
