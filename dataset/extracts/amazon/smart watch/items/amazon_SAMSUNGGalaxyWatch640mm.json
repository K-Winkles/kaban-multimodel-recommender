Coming from a Gear2 (which still works) this is a step up. Some functions only work with a Samsung phone, which I do not have, is a bit disappointing, but it may give me an excuse to upgrade that too. I wish battery life was better, I get a full day /day and a half, was hoping for 3/4 like my husband gets with his watch5 (or 4?) Overall I'm really happy with this purchase and happy to save $!",
