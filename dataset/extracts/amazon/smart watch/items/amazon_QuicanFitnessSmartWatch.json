However, once I became familiar with it I am very please with all the functions..I love how I can down load pictures from my photo album. Very cool. Are their any screen protectors which can be purchased for a round faced watch?",

                "reviewText": "Fitness Smart Watch for Women, Quican iOS Android Compatible Bluetooth Watch, Activity Tracker with Heart Rate/Sleep Monitor/Calorie Counter, Reloj Inteligente Support 100 Sports, IP68 Waterproof (Pink)The fitness smartwatch comes simply packaged in a shrink-wrapped white cardboard box with a line drawing of a watch on the front and manufacturers info on the back. There is also a QR code on the back that is for the very fit program for your phone.After removing the shrink wrap, the watch slides open via a ribbon p pulling up in a drawer, presentation style. Sits in a formed plastic tray, and has a warranty card on top. Underneath the tray with the watch, is a charging cable and an instruction booklet. The charging cable is a USBA to a proprietary magnet connection. There is no wall adapter included in this kit, so you'll have to use your own or use a battery pack or charge from your computer.Looking at the watch itself, it is a fairly wide watch face, with a screen size of about an inch and a quarter. The pink straps for the watch are a rubberized silicone type with a plastic buckle. The face of the watch is nearly all screen, with a single physical button that is designed to resemble a watch stem. The back of the watch has magnetic charging contacts, a heart rate sensor, and a speaker opening and microphone opening on the lower sides, along with an extra hole labeled as\" pressure relief\" in the instruction sheet.Looking at the instruction sheet, it is a long fold-out sheet written in multiple languages in a tiny font, (Seriously tiny, I had to get a magnifying glass to read part of it) with the stem on the side of the watch being used as an activation button. The instructions don't talk about most of the functions of the watch, so I'm presuming it will be on the app, once I have installed it and paired the watch. The instructions, (and the sticker on the face of the watch) recommend that you fully charge the watch to activate it before you use it.So, I guess it's time to charge the watch. The magnetic end of the charging cable connected automatically as I put the charging cable near the back of the watch. The magnets are strong enough that the attraction to the proper location was a definite pull. When you plug it into charge, the face of the watch glowed. (visible through the sticker placed on it from the factory) and there was a \u201cding\" sound, and the face read \u201cturn on\". There is nothing in the instructions about how long it will take to charge the watch, so I'm presuming that something on the watch face will change when it is fully charged.As luck would have it, we had a copy of very fit on our phone from a previous watch. Once you have paired the watch with the app, there are a lot of functions here. Call alerts, sedentary alert, an alarm alert, a message alert, heart rate detection that you can set for one time or automatically, and a lot more.The bottom line on this watch? This is a very good entry-level watch that has a larger face than some. I do wish that the charging cord was a little longer. ( It's only a little over a foot and a half) The wristband on the watch is fairly comfortable, but you have to wear it moderately tight so that it can measure your heartbeat.",

Many free watch faces from site witch pairs easily to device. Easy to read due to size but at the same time a bit on the bulky side. I've adjusted to that and highly recommend watch especially at this price.",

                "reviewText": "This is a cool little watch. The silicone strap is adjustable, strong and comfortable. The face of the watch is surprisingly large, brightly lit and easy to read. It comes with a magnetic charging cord, which is about 16 to 20 inches long. Also included is a booklet with pretty good instructions on how to set it up and use. It has an app for both android and iPhone users, which is very easy to navigate. The app collects a lot information from your watch, and displays it all. On the app you can also find helpful articles on getting better sleep, dieting, and exercise, etc. There is even a journal. You can sync the watch to your phone, and it displays texts, calls, and any notifications you have set on your phone. It monitors your sleep, exercise, activity, your stress levels, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and so much more. You can change the watch face using the app, and there are quite a few free choices. You can choose the classic watch face or digital, dark or light mode, and set it so it does not disturb you while you sleep. There are four different brightness settings, 3 different vibration intensity settings, and volume control. It has a flashlight, a timer, a stopwatch and shows you the weather. It even has the ability to sync with your Alexa, which is so handy. It's pretty amazing for the price. I've been wearing mine for over 72 hours and haven't needed to charge it yet, which is pretty awesome. I'm nowhere near tech savvy, but I found this watch and the app, easy to figure out and use. I'm very, very pleased with my new watch!",

The pink color is also super cute and chic! However, I've had some issues with notifications. It tends to alert me for every small change, like phone charging percentage or navigation updates, which can get annoying. Additionally, text and WhatsApp notifications aren't always reliable. To avoid these distractions, I've turned off notifications and now use my watch primarily for activity tracking. Despite these issues, I still think the watch is well-made and a great choice for women looking for a reliable fitness tracker.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have always had an interest in smartwatches. Back in 1983, I had the Seiko Data 2000 which was thought to be the world's first smartwatch. Since then I have been fascinated with the evolution of watches.I have owned several name-brand watches as well as several sub $100 off-brand watches.As technology improves the features on watches go up and the price comes down. When it comes to sub $100 watches I have noticed that the higher prices do not necessarily represent a better watch.It can be a daunting task nowadays to determine which watch is for you. For me, I first must like the look of the watch and secondly, it needs the features I need. Quality is then important.I saw this round-faced pink watch which had a little different look from most smartwatches and I wanted to try it.The watch came well packaged with the silicone wristband attached. There is also a USB-A to magnet charging cable, a warranty card, and a user manual included.You download the \"veryfit\" app on your phone and the watch quickly pairs with it.The watch has a very nice look to it. It seems solidly built and the single button is firm with no wobble.The screen is vibrant and very clear.You maneuver through the menus of the watch by pressing a single button and using the touch screen. It is very simple on this watch to find the features you want as you get different ways of accessing the menus depending on the way you swipe the screen.I have added a video showing this.The watch measures steps, blood oxygen level, and pulse rate. I found these to be accurate when compared to more traditional forms of measurement.There are more than 100 activities that can be monitored and tracked from the watch and the app.The watch feels comfortable on the wrist and not overly heavy or large.The watch faces are nice and made specifically for a round watch.All of the functions you expect in a watch are present including weather, stopwatch, phone calling and receiving, and much more.It also has Alexa built in so you can do many functions with your voice.I am very happy with this watch. For the current price of $40, it is great value.I do recommend this to anyone wanting their first smartwatch with a lot of features or even to someone to add a new style to their current collection.",

This sleek and stylish smartwatch caters to both men and women, making it a versatile and fashion-forward accessory while offering a wide range of impressive features that enhance your daily life.Compatibility:One of the standout features of the watch is its compatibility with both iPhone and Android devices. No matter your smartphone preference, you can seamlessly sync this watch to your device and have an enjoyable user experience.Activity Tracking:Whether you're an avid fitness enthusiast or just looking to stay more active, the watch covers a lot of activity tracking. It tracks your steps, monitors your heart rate, and calculates the calories you burn throughout the day. This real-time feedback is incredibly motivating and can help you stay on track with your fitness goals. The watch also tracks your sleep. Its advanced sleep monitoring feature provides insights into the quality of your sleep, helping you identify patterns and make improvements to ensure a more restful night.Waterproof Design:This watch boasts a waterproof design that can withstand sweat and rain, which I can attest to. However, it also mentions that its waterproof capacity is safe for even a dip in the pool (though it's not suitable for deep-water activities). I believe from my experience so far that you can confidently wear it during all your outdoor and sweaty activities without fear of damage.Bluetooth Connectivity:Furthermore, this watch uses Bluetooth technology to effortlessly connect to your smartphone. This means you can receive notifications, messages, and calls directly on your wrist, keeping you connected without having to pull out your phone constantly.Stylish Design:Fashion meets functionality with this smartwatch. Its modern and customizable face design is suitable for both men and women, making it a versatile accessory that complements any outfit or occasion. The adjustable band ensures a comfortable fit for all wrist sizes. Although this round design in particular does make it a little bulkier compared to other square shaped smartwatches. Users have the option to change the watch face (home screen wallpaper) to suit different styles or moods, however the overall design is generally more masculine and rugged.After trying out a few other similar devices, this watch is my favourite so far. The screen is responsive and the design is timeless. The only way it could\u2019ve been better is if it had a dedicated LED torch flashlight similar to a phone.",

                "reviewText": "I'm really enjoying this smart watch. The pink strap and pink plastic case appear, to my eyes, to be perfectly colour matched. And I love the slightly deeper, darker pink metal bezel with it's texture like a tiny vinyl record, and matching crown. Though the case is plastic, it has a good tough feel to it, and the finish isn't perfectly smooth which means it shouldn't get that scuffed look that shiny surfaces suffer from after a little wear and tear. The strap is comfortable, and the ridged inside surface means you're less likely to get sweaty from it since silicon is obviously not a porous material that might absorb moisture. The strap closure is a traditional buckle.I've always worn watches, and up until the era of the square(ish) Apple Watch shape, they've tended to have round faces, so when I found this smart watch / fitness tracker with a ROUND face I simply couldn't resist, and I'm so glad I got it.I haven't worn my old Fitbit alongside this Quican smart watch to see how the step counters, heart rate, and other stats compare, but the numbers reported on the screen and in the VeryFit app are completely in-line with my expectations. But the real reason I have been wearing a smart watch / fitness tracker is actually so that I can see alerts from my phone without having to reach for the phone itself.I am impressed with the message display being so complete on the screen despite it not being square or rectangular! The interface makes it easy to get to messages - tap on them when they come in, and if they disappear just swipe up to see recent messages. Swipe down for settings. Swipe right for apps. Swipe left for fitness data. It's all very easy.I am also happy with the VeryFit app. It's not as polished as what Fitbit offers, but pretty much everything is there. And I know from friends that not all smart watch / fitness tracker apps will allow you to pair your device to multiple watches... but VeryFit does allow that.I would have given this smart watch a full 5-star review, but I found a bug: it doesn't play nicely with Siri! Fortunately, I don't use Siri a whole lot... though I do sometimes use it in the car. I reached out and reported the issue, and I've been told that the logs I provided from the watch have helped identify a bug... and I'm told a new firmware will be released soon to address this. So, fingers crossed. As a result... 4-stars for now. If they fix the issue - and also, if they don't! - I'll try to come back and update this review.Siri issue aside, I do like this watch a lot. If you have an Android device or never use Siri, then I see zero reason not to take a shot at this Quican smart watch. If you use Siri a lot then you might be taking your chances...",

                "reviewText": "I'm really genuinely impressed by the myriad of budget-friendly fitness tracker / smart watches on the market right now. Most of the ones I've encountered have item numbers like IDW13, IDW18, and IDW19. This Quican one is the IDW18 model.A few years ago I was wanting to have some of the fun data that my partner was collecting with her FitBit. Being an iPhone user, the Apple Watch got first consideration but I simply couldn't tolerate such an expensive item potentially needing to be charged Every Single Night... especially because I wanted the sleep tracking like my lady has! In the end, I went with a FitBit Sense which was on sale for about half the price of an Apple Watch, but promised 5 days or more of battery life. Honestly, I've never really regretted the decision... though there are some things about the FitBit that could be improved, like the inability to see a notification after it's initial display... even if you didn't get to see it!!Lately I found myself wanting something more traditional looking because I always loved watches, and this IDW18 caught my eye for it's sharp looks... to me, at least. I also have other IDWxx watches and among the first things I've done with them is to change the watch face in the VeryFit app... but with this one from Konitee, I was happy with the watch face right out of the box. It's sleek and stylish and includes enough info that I'm happy.The touch screen is nice and easy to use -- swipe down and you get watch settings; swipe up for recent notifications that the VeryFit app can be set to push to the watch; left and right get you various activity details and additional apps, which are configurable. And yes, you can scroll back through recent notifications - yay!The rubber/silicon strap is nice, though a traditional style - not like an Apple Watch. But it feels good and works well, in any case.The VeryFit app isn't as refined as the FitBit app, but still does a good job. Fitness tracking seems to be reliable and accurate enough for me.Battery life is excellent at an easy 5-7 days depending on the number of notifications, whether you have vibration and/or sounds turned on, screen brightness, and so on. Charging to 100% only takes a couple hours too.But then I discovered something... I noticed that with this watch connected to my iPhone using Bluetooth, requests to \"Siri\" would not complete. The multi-coloured Siri listening blob would hang around for a while and then go away. And then, the watch would restart! Weird, right?! As it turns out, I have another IDW18 in a different colour and I contacted the seller via Amazon and - long story, short - they advise that a new IDW18 firmware will hopefully be available mid-October.If it wasn't for this issue, I would give the watch a full 5-star review. If it weren't for the quick response I got, I would have given the watch a 3-star review. Out of optimism, I am submitting a 4-star review and I WILL BE BACK to UPDATE this review depending on whether I see a firmware update and Siri fix in the near future.",
