                "reviewText": "I haven't owned this watch very long, but already I'm noticing a big difference with it compared to other similar smartwatches. It's much more responsive to touch, the health monitoring apps are much more detailed and thorough, and the App used for connecting with mobile devices is the BEST compared to the other 2 common Apps (DaFit & FitCloudPro) that most military-style smartwatches use.I hope I've finally found my match and won't need to look any further.Good luck, Shoppers. Cheers.2nd EDIT:I just received another order for this watch, hopinh the first one was just a defective unit. But this one has the same issue with the blood pressure readings being off by more than 20 points! I use the actual device to measure and monitor it my blood pressure, but I need a smartwatch that could continuously measure my blood pressure in 10 minute intervals so i can see how the trend looks throughout the day and also at night when I'm asleep.Everything else about this watch is next to perfect...If you want a premium smartwatch that's also affordable, and monitoring your blood pressure isn't your goal, I'd recommend this watch with all my heart. The user interface is more user friendly than any smartwatch I've tried. The App used to connect to this watch was also well made (GloryFit App).1st EDIT:I noticed my blood pressure readings are way off.It's much, much lower than it actually is.The heart rate monitor is reading just fine, so I know I'm not just wearing it wrong.I really hope this unit is simply defective, as I was so glad I thought I finally found the right Smartwatch.",

I tried wearing it loose, tight, and in between through multiple nights. Because of this, I'm thinking my steps and other things that are tracked are inaccurate as well. I contacted their support through a form on their site early on, and I've never received a response. I'm thinking I will be returning very soon. ... I had high hopes for this, especially with the ratings and reviews. I wish my Amazon Halo wasn't being discontinued. This PopGlory watch was replacing it for me.",
