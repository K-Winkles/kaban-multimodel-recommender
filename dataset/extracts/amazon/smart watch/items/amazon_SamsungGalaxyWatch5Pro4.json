This one has been on my wrist for about a week and it is a significant improvement. I was a little concerned buying a pre-owned item but the price was just too good and I was very surpised at the excellent condition of the watch upon arrival. Pros: accuracy, display, watch face options, overall functionality. One of the highlights that I did not expect was the auto recognizing of my exercise. It typically will begin within one minute regardless of what I am doing. Cons: My only issue with the watch is the charger interface. I have an official samsung charger but the magnet is so weak that you have to connect the two and then very gently set it down or the charger puck disengages from the watch. I had to buy a charging stand to address that issue. Very highly recommended fitness watch.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Galaxy 3 for almost 3 years and thought it was a great product. I got the BP to work but when I upgraded my phone, it erased the app and no longer supported so I was out of luck. Upgrading to the Watch 5 pro was easier than I expected, almost everything transferred easily with no issues (Samsung S23 Ultra). Activating mobile plan took 60 seconds and for $5 a month, it's hard to beat. The watch itself is about the same size as my old 3, but lasts twice as long, with everything on it's good for maybe 2 days. Like having GPS and Mobile network so I can leave the phone at home when I want to, which is liberating. Listen to spotify, audible with earbuds and no phone needed is easy to get used to. For under 200 refurbished, I'm completely satisfied as mine only had a couple smudges and looked new otherwise. I was also able to get the BP working (U.S.) with an onboard software mod that makes the entire process easy. The readings are fairly accurate for me, just like the 3 was. Calibrating showed it only off a few points. Best choice for android, especially samsung.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good watch with some software issues.",
                "reviewText": "It's a good watch, but there are some disappointing experiences:1) First time I went for a run and wanted to test out the cellular connection, it overheated and told me to wait. This happened twice since I've owned the watch, and it's usually been on actually hot days. I do have a protective cover, so that may be part o the problem.2) Run tracking is buggy...sometimes. I often start my run from my front door, where my watch has a connection with either my WiFi or phone. When I start a run from this location, it always seems to have trouble determining how far I've run. I'll be 3 minutes into my run and it will say I've done a mile (I wish!). If I bring my phone with me, there is no issue. If I drive to a trail and run it does perfectly fine. I have the feeling their run tracking is using a WiFi rough location to start my run.3) Spotify. This won't count against the watch so much, because it's probably mostly a software issue. I would think it's a pretty good chance that using Spotify with headphones while you're not around your phone is a pretty good use case for a cellular watch. This does work, but it's really not intuitive to use. Sometimes the Spotify UI will just sit there and not tell you whether it's trying to play something, or if it's loading, or whatever. You can literally sit there for minutes fiddling around trying to figure out what Spotify is trying to do. Sometimes when it does work, the events are delayed. For instance I may have chosen a song 10 seconds ago, and gotten no feedback from the UI, yet it will eventually play something.4) Google's apps aren't fully integrated. It's like they're still not fully committed to wearables. For instance, if someone is at the door, you will get a notification. Would you like to see who it is? Well, you will have to go find your phone. There are many apps that don't show useful notifications on the watch. There is so much opportunity to make wearables actually much better than they are, and it's frustrating that Google just doesn't put in the effort.That's pretty much the bad stuff. Now for the good news. When this watch works, it does a really nice job. The watch faces built in are really nice IMO, and you can customize them pretty well with useful shortcuts. (I added a shortcut to start a workout and another to set a timer). We do get Google Assistant now, and I've assigned mine to be triggered by long pressing one of the buttons. Google pay works fine for me. In my experience the battery is much much better than my previous Android watches, which removes some level of anxiety. The build quality is great. I am rough with my watches, and the screen on this one is pretty much scratch free at this point. I take this in the pool and in the shower, so absolutely no issues with water exposure. The workout tracking software is actually great when it is recording correctly.",
