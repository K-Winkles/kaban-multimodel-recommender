I couldn't get it to work on my galaxy 21+ so I figured I'd save it for my little girls phone. Is a samsung brand as well and nope. My oldest daughter got one for Christmas with the other one for my youngest daughter and she has an iPhone, will not work with it either so it's basically useless",

The only thing I'd change is the phone app. It's a bit clunky.",
