                "reviewText": "Got this brand new model because my Vivosmart 4 watch band finally broke. I didn't really want to go back to a watch form factor after wearing bands for many years. But this one is super light weight and I can wear it anywhere, even in the water. The battery lasts for days. You can download the Connect IQ app and customize the watch, including adding new features and faces. Interestingly, you can create a custom face in both the IQ app, and on the watch itself, although the options are not the same and results are not consistent.Pros:- Great screen, highly visible in varying light- Good battery life. Much better than the old vivosmart 4, seems like at least a week.- GPS - seems to work well enough on walks/runs I've done.- Nice selection of exercises built in. I've only used walk/run/swim so far. The app has been trying to get me to upload personalized running plans and workouts. Just haven't got to that yet either.- User interface is _mostly_ easy to use, once you figure it out.Cons- Extra info on faces (steps, heartbeat etc), and user interface has very small fonts. It's not a big device after all. But those of us who can't focus up close have a hard time seeing the small things without the glasses- Another weird charger connector. Next version should be able to charge wirelessly. Those other guys do it.- The included band is pretty utilitarian and I already see wear around where the buckle rubs on it. At least it's replaceable with standard sized bands.Overall I am happy with this watch so far.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this for almost a year now. I've not had any issues with it. Love that I can change the face to fit my needs and track what I want to track. They have several apps that you can put on the watch to use for different activities like cycling, golfing. I haven't really gotten it wet yet. Out of habit, I take it off before showering, swimming, etc. My other fitness watches were not water resistant/proof. To me it is a nice size. People mistake it for an apple watch. My battery life has been excellent between charges. I go anywhere from 7 to 14 days between charges and that usually depends on my activity as well as what the level is when I decide to charge it. Charges quickly as well. I don't have some things constantly monitor, like the O2, and that helps as well with the battery life, I'm sure. Depending on what watch face you use, some info may be too small to read if you use reading glasses and don't have them on. I get notifications for my iPhone and can read the text and see who's calling but cannot respond to call or text from watch. I'm good with that as it gives me the freedom to not feel like I have to stop what I am doing to answer. The bands are easy to change out as well.",

So I returned it and decided to go with the Venu Sq 2, since I liked the design and did not need as many features that were on other models.I does pretty good for my needs. The lack of a hiking app was dealt with a non-Garmin app. But with activities such as walking, hiking, even timer... there is not always a quick route to start. The watch does not always go right to the start function to begin tracking.And there is a lag time for some notifications.Over all I am pretty satisfied with my watch. It is stylish and battery lasts a week plus before needing to charge.",
