                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my husband.He had already tried 2 other watches (in the $25 range) to monitor sleep vitals like oxygen levels, track deep sleep patterns, etc...but they didn't work as advertised. This one cost just a little more, but was still in the lower price point vs spending over $100.Definitely impressed with the watch! For starters, the box that it came in is very nice/nicely designed. The watch came with 2 bands - a silicone and a stainless steel, which is a nice weight and makes the watch feel strong and sturdy. It also came with a tool to adjust the stainless steel watch band, which was another surprise feature. Overall he is very happy with the quality of the watch and the functions that it provides.",

Between my 2\" wide wrist, thin skin & lack of fat, I was uncertain if the watch could not make enough surface contact tomonitor vital signs. No problems at all.The first thing I did was change the skeletal gear watch face to something readable and set the screen time to 5 seconds. Unlike my smart phone, the watch time is even readable in the sun. The metal watch band is huge compared to my boney little wrist. Fortunately a nifty little tool to adjust the band length is included. The silicone band is perfect. It can easily be adjusted to comfortably fit my wrist and the watch actually stays in place. Plus the band doesn't irritate my skin like plastic bands do. This is my first smart watch and I'm unfamiliar with the symbols. Changing the menu setting to Style 2 was the solution. The symbols are now labeled. I've just started to familiarize myself with the watches many features. The pedometer, BP, heart rate & O2 monitors all work. The fitness tracker is great. So much to learn and explore. I'm a very happy camper.",

                "reviewText": "The company may be called FOXBOX, but this is straight-up a LIGE smart-watch, identical to that particular name in the mid-range smart-watch rung that is well-known for being a step above in both physical quality, and function list of features.A lot of people will accept the mid-range class as \"it's great \u2014 for the price\" but I argue that most of them are not even remotely worth paying as much as you do, for what you get. At $65 bucks this watch is no more or less than most of those, but it offers a working feature set that actually does rival the $120-150 smart watch class.Let's just start with the weight and build of this watch. It's an all-metal, tactical round-watch design with an \"actual\" high resolution touch screen that actually responds properly to the smallest touch, and that covers the entire circumference of the interface, not just pretends to until you hold it up to the light. The watch also comes with both a matching all-metal strap (and complimentary adjusting tool) but also a high grade rubber strap (which I generally prefer most days, functionally) that has grooved designed to secure it in a way I don't often see on most of the cheaper straps.The software seems much improved also, offering a \"Pro\" fitness app that in and of itself is also of a higher caliber than the alternatives. A huge collection of watch faces, apps that seem responsive and connective to the watch monitoring. And on that note: the monitoring tools on the watch themselves... WOW. The moment I laid the watch across my wrist, it was already attempting to gauge my statistics, it is incredibly sensitive and responsive on all counts. I can't believe it offers a sensor chip that monitor not merely your heart rate, but also blood oxygen, and apparently blood pressure as well??? I don't even know how that's possible, but it does so quickly and, as far as I can tell, efficiently. I really did not expect such a wide variety of health conditions offered and, as it seems, with accurate proficiency.The options do not stop here. There are subtle features across the entire watch system that just make this feel so much more like a near-to-premium device, like password protection, a variety of app screen layouts, better vibration control, voice assistant and calling options that all seem generally superior to other brands in its price range.I have tried a lot of so-called \"smart\" watches in this class and, to date, this is now my favourite of the bunch.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Decent for a semi-smart watch- Extensive number of 'apps' or options, though a few are useful you still get the options for all the rest- Nice bands, they are good for the price, and you have two options to choose from. I prefer the metal bracelet though some have said it opens or digs into their wrist I did not find that at all in my case.- Easy to adjust metal bracelet, adjustment tool is included- Silicon strap is nice, though not my style, though it is still quite good and decent quality- Watch has a nice weight to it and feels much heavier than other smart watches. I understand the trend is to light as possible and also 'not feeling it on', but that isn't for me, and this has the heft I wanted.- Finish is nicely done, anti-reflective matt black that so far is staying on well and not scratched overly. There are some spots that have a mark, but that is me wearing it working outside and all around, so it is very durable and if you wear a watch to actually use it, I say this stands up very well. Not just a show piece.- Monitoring for sleep, blood pressure and beats all worked without any issues, even if the band is slightly loose, they seemed to work and matched pretty closely to a real pulse check and a standalone blood pressure cuff machine.- Display is nice and large for the size and other watches out there, it also is bright and crisp.- Watch faces are easily changed, though it does take time to get back to the old style if you change your mind.- Connectivity with the phone via Bluetooth is stable and once paired works flawlessly. This is not a truly independent smart watch; it relies on your phone and the BT connection to actually become smart. Less cost so good choice for entry level selections.- Includes charger, extra strap as mentioned above, link tool, screen wipe and all the paperwork you would expect.Cons:- Not truly smart or independent of a phone, but for the price who cares.Conclusion:If you like all metal bands, good heft and want a reasonably priced entry to wearing a smart watch then this is probably at the top of the options currently on Amazon. This is a solid 4.5-Star watch and I recommend it as excellent option.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this watch, unlike many other smart watches I have had this one has a metal strap that clips closed and not a silicone strap. It does come with a silicone strap though if you happen to like that style more. The metal strap can be adjusted in length by removing links, included is a nice tool to help you do this, simply line up the hole with the tool point then start to turn the tools handle, this will push the tool forward and push the pin out of the link enough that you can grab it and pull it out the rest. Watch has a nice weight to it due to being metal and the finish is beautiful flat black, does not feel \"cheap\" from what I can tell the quality is very good. What I like most about this watch is that I do not have to wear it overly snug to have the monitoring functions to work, unlike other smart watches I have had that you had to wear quite snug and even then sometimes the monitoring would not work, this one has worked perfect so far every option such as blood pressure, O2 levels, heart rate all work on first attempt, again unlike other watches I have had that you had to try once to be told the watch needed to be adjusted then try again to have same error. It also will monitor sleep workout records workouts daily steps etc. The display is sharp and screen is easy to see/read, it is also a bit larger of a screen than many smart watches. You can create a custom face if you wish to, or choose from 100's that you can get with the App. The App is easy to use and does not require internet once installed, the App and phone are linked through the Bluetooth, once the watch is paired with your phone you can get the current temp/weather, make phone calls, listen to music and more The watch even has a speaker that you can listen to your music or phone calls, It also has a mic that can be used to speak on the phone, or voice assistant and other features. In the box was the charger, which is a magnetic kind, a silicone strap, the metal strap, a screen wipe as well a small micro fiber cloth, warranty card, pin removal tool for the pins in the metal band and watch strap pins. I would for sure recommend this watch to anyone who likes this style (metal strap/military) as this has to be the best smart watch I have owned thus far. 5 out of 5 all day long..",

                "reviewText": "This decently priced watch sits around the average mark for watches of this level.There are many different functions available, most of them novelty gadgets that offer a starting point to monitor some of your activities. The problem is that most of the health and activity features are not very accurate. It feels like you input an activity, cycling for example, and the app doesn't really monitor what you are doing, it just makes an internal estimate based on the time and an average.It doesn't take into account things like going uphill, riding an ebike, or tell the difference between rollerblades and walking.Still, it at least tracks something, and is almost ten times cheaper than the really good, accurate watch of this type.Again comparing to similar watch at this price range, I found that the battery life was a bit shorter than the average.The option between the two wristband is good, and the instructions along with the tool provided to change them is nice. However, bear in mind that the metallic bracelet tends to come undone if you do sports, like running or cycling. The clasp cuts right into the wrist and then comes undone.Furthermore, while the screen is responsive, I found that the ergonomy was a bit lacking. There are very few display options to choose from, and the settings menu is both very restricted and finicky. You can't preview any of the display functions, you have to try them, and then fight through them to get them back to how they were.Still, overall, it's a decent watch for the price. It isn't as bulky as some of the others of that type, and at this price it makes for a good entry-level 'smart' watch.",

                "reviewText": "I already have a watch very similar. In fact, it is the same manufacturer that is supplied to different brands to retail. Virtually nothing is different, but nothing is then special either- which is ok as it is still value for your money.For starters, the watch looked good and is sturdy, based on a classic design. Although only two of the buttons actually work. The rest are just to look nice. It comes with a metal and rubber band. The rubber is comfortable and substantial and is what I use. A pin-press to take the watchband on and off is included.Connecting to the phone is not easy, but disconnecting is. It is a pain to reconnect every time. Also annoying is the tendency for the watch to play music through it rather than through much preferred Bluetooth earphones. You can switch to those of course. But as I said, annoying. Who wants to listen to music on their watch when you have a perfectly good phone with better sound and/or earphones?You need a proprietary app to link to your phone too. This is also where you can get more watch-face designs you can switch to. None of which is the design shown in the promotional photos. But some are ok. Some just look cheap. But you can get faces at off-site marketplacesSome of the apps are nice to have like built-in step and heart rate monitor. But I don't put much stock in the accuracy. As a general guide, they are fine to have however.Patience is required overall. Maybe this reflects my newness to the technology though as I have not had a smartwatch previous so have no benchmark to work from.Battery life is good though lasting days on one charge. So, a mixed bag technologically speaking. But given the base price and competing offerings on the market, I still give it reasonable marks for overall value.",
