                "reviewText": "I had an apple watch with my iphone and really enjoyed it. Since I recently switched to a Samsung s23, I needed a new watch that was compatible, but I wanted something more affordable.For the price I am very satisfied several days in.Pros:Very inexpensive for the level of functionalityNice size. Not too big or smallNice variety of digital watch \"faces\" to choose fromSeems very accurate compared to my much more expensive apple watchImpressive battery life (I haven't charged it for several days and I'm at still over 80%)Cons:DOES NOT MAKE / RECEIVE CALLS. Just alerts you that a call is coming in and you have to answer on your phone. If that feature is important to you, this isn't your watch.Also can't reply to messages via the watch itself - need to use phoneCan't read entire text messages on watchCan't change the bandIf you just want health data and alerts to tell you to check your phone for messages and calls, this watch is an absolute steal and I'd totally recommend. If you want to be able to do most of what you can do on your phone also on the watch, this probably won't meet your expectations.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. He used to have an Apple Watch but it didn\u2019t hold a charge any longer. He really just wanted some thing that would track his steps. He absolutely loves this watch. He says it does everything the Apple Watch can do for the most part. The best thing about it is the battery lasts for close to five days without being recharged. He has told me every day it was the best purchase and you can\u2019t beat the price.",
