Lasts for over two days on battery without charging, which is nice. Have worn it in the shower with no issues. Stress is also off a bit. Finally, steps are a bit off. I stand and walk most of my shift at work. Some days I've had 15k steps and some under 5k. It's not really possible, considering my job, to be so far off.",

I was quite scared to buy this product from the bad reviews but idk what they\u2019re talking about tbh.",

It came fast, but I open the watch, it doesn't come charged from the factory, so I charge it. The watch turns on properly, but the default watch face is hideous. I scroll through the pages on the watch, the only features are: heart rate, steps, blood pressure, clock, Alexa, and a flashlight. I tested it out, none of the data is accurate. The Alexa needed to connect to an Alexa device, which was a bit frustrating, but I did connect it to my Alexa device anyways But, it doesn't work. I do some troubleshooting, nothing's working. I finally get it connected, and the answers are all wonky, and the Alexa feature was autoset to Spanish. I ended up returning the watch. I don't recommend buying this if you're looking for accurate data.",
