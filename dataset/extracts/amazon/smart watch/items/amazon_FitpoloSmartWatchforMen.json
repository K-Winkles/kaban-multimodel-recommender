                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When finding a watch that could track my steps but also have some kind of alarm function that vibrates, I found that this was the perfect choice.I share a dorm-room currently, and sometimes my poor roommate has to endure my loud alarm in the mornings. I wanted something that was more quiet but that would actually give me the motivation to wake up and get up. Since this watch has that function where it dings but ALSO shakes on my wrist, I find it easier to wake up and get out of bed.The rest of the functions, such as tracking steps, time and sleep are great. The sleep tracker is not quite as accurate so I wouldn\u2019t recommend this if you want an extremely accurate way to track your sleep. It tracks steps and fitness well, on the other hand. The battery life as well is fantastic, I only really need to charge it once a week if any.It does not come with any protective screen, so if you are active or clumsy like I am, I recommend getting a touch-sensitive film or something to protect the screen. Combined, still cheaper than an apple watch so yay for that.I recently dropped the watch while taking it off, and one of the band parts broke off. I was surprised to see how well it was made, because it was incredibly easy to put it back together (see photo that shows the back lever bit for easy application of straps). The material is nice as well, and it is comfortable enough to sleep with it on, which was important for me to have it as an alarm.I\u2019d say my wrists are somewhat thinner, and you can adjust it quite well to fit any wrist size. It stays on quite snugg for me even without the smallest setting, so I don\u2019t have to worry about it sliding off ever really.Other than that, I have only used it really for an alarm and step tracker, but the app they have you download helps with tracking all kinds of fitness stuff, so overall it\u2019s a pretty good investment.AND most importantly, for sure, is that you can customize the watch face. The kitties one shown in the photo is a free one you download on the app, where you can even set customizable images as well (as shown in the video as well). Currently they have Valentines themed watch faces, so if you want to hint to your partner to get active this is a great gift for the occasion. Totally :)",

Overall excellent value for money. The Amazon Alexa features work the best. I owned previous Fitpolo watch versions as well. This one excels all prior versions with excellent features for the same price. It came with 97% charge & worked great right out of the box. The packaging was excellent as well. The pairing with my Samsung Galaxy was a breeze. It connected instantly with the VeryFit mobile app with no issues at all. The registration & Amazon Alexa integration done pretty nicely as well. As soon as I connect the watch, I got notification about the available Firmware update. I opted to install the update & the firmware update was done (from v1.01.00 to v1.01.01) with absolutely no issues. The smart watch looks pretty neat, stylish & sturdy. The watch strap could have been a bit study as well. I wish they sell with an additional strap as well (Sure, I don't mind paying a few dollars extra for that). Other than that it's all good for me. I will use the watch for some more time & update you all with any more updates. Good luck to All! And Kudos to the team who worked on this great product!",

The phone function receives calls that are clear and I am easily heard by the caller. Controlling music and audiobooks works great. However, the heart rate alert measures higher when compared with my Oximeter reading. The sleep measurements sometimes only records 3+ hours sleep out of a 8-9 hour session. The steps record a lower number when compared with pedometer. It has prompted me a few times with a \"wear watch correctly\" when trying to get BPM/SPO2/Relax. I also found that the VeryFit app has to be running in the background for certain features to work.Still, I'm very happy with the watch as it is a good value and meets or exceeds my needs.",

I was wanting an Apple Watch as most people do but couldn\u2019t afford it so I was trying to find the next best thing and this watch is really good especially for the price! Customer service is great, when I received my watch they sent me a message on Amazon and said if I need help with anything just reach out to them, I didn\u2019t need help since it\u2019s so easy to set up but I thought them reaching out was really nice. The app is great, there\u2019s a variety of backgrounds you can choose for free or $.50 and you can upload your own photo for free as well. Alexa works well. Nice large screen which I love. My notifications come through nicely, unfortunately not all of my app notifications are compatible but my texts, emails, and calls come through so I\u2019m satisfied with that. The battery is alright, I don\u2019t think it would last a full week but I use mine often, for me it would probably last 2-3 days without charge but I charge mine once a day anyway. Has a lot of cool functions like tracking sleep, heart rate, oxygen, stress, you can control your music.. there\u2019s a lot of functions. Oh and I love the beige color watch band because it goes with everything, I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone.",

The watch fits well on my wrist. I have skinny wrists and I do not find it too big. Within the app, EVERYTHING is customizable: You can pick which types of exercise that you do, remove exercises that you\u2019ll never use. You have the option of a 12 or 24 hr clock and it has an alarm clock. The units of measurement are changeable (lbs/kg, celsius/fahrenheit, miles/km). It tracks heartrate, sleep, stress levels, Sp02, steps, distance, calories burned, weight, etc. and all these tracking items you can choose to keep or remove. You can enter in your height, weight, gender, etc. You can change what the week start day is (Sunday or Monday). It receives SMS texts & Messenger messages. You can control music with it. If you have Alexa, it can sync with that. The watch face can be changed, there are lots of different skins. And you can buy screen protectors off Amazon for it. It\u2019s so awesome to have only paid $45 for this watch vs. a brand name one, like Fitbit, which is $200+. Highly recommend and would buy again!!",

It has all of the features of a more expensive tracker. It has steps, sleep, heart rate, oxygen levels, workouts and more. The battery charges quickly and holds a charge well. The strap for this model is intergrated which makes it less likely to break. The app is easy to load and read. There are several free watch faces to choose from.

The font is perfect size, and you can tap on the message preview to see the entire message. It has a neat flashlight option, it's not super bright but helps me get to bed at night after my husband is already sleeping. The battery life is great, more than 1 week per charge! I haven't used the workout functions, but I do enjoy the sleep quality information... it seems pretty accurate for sleep start/end time and waking during the night. It also has a weather feature and customizable watch face (I chose a picture from my gallery). My one concern is that it has randomly disconnects from my phone Bluetooth, but after a few restarts of the watch and my phone it reconnects. Not sure what that's about. But as a beginner to a smartwatch I love it, and so does my 15yr old daughter, who I also bought one for. Her complaint, however, is that the band causes a rash. I presume it's her young sensitive skin and the silicone band. I haven't had this issue (50yr old female). Note that this watch has NO wifi.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this watch because my last Fitpolo broke (I couldn't charge it anymore because its magnet got inverted somehow). The Fitpolo customer service was great. After first trying to replace the charger for free, when I realized the problem wasn't the charger, they offered to pay for the latest model to replace my watch.I love this watch. It works great and has a lot of useful features. Its only flaw, for me, is its much bigger size because I have such small wrists. But apart from that, it's perfect.",
