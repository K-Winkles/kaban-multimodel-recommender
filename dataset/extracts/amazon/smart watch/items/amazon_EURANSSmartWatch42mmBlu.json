                "reviewText": "I ordered the Niudokk smartwatch kinda by mistake. A real surprise when I got it and started using it. I had one issue in changing the units from KM's to MILEs on the watch. But eventually figured it out. Between the smartwatch and the FITDOCK app that is associated with it, you have a tremendous number of options and information to work with, but still very manageable. The watch is a very comfortable fit. Previous reviews said that the band burns your skin if sensitive. Either they corrected the \"burning\" issue, or I don't have sensitive skin. No problems at all, and I can wear it for hours. Having only used a \"stopwatch\" before, the distance covered during my exercises has always been an approximation. The GPS-based software gives very accurate distance and time. It calculates out the average MPH over the duration, as well as steps, cadence and calories burned. I really look forward to my next \"event\" to rack up the points towards my weekly goals. Very happy with the purchase. Finally, a mistake that I can live with and enjoy.",

To set it up you need to download an app and scan the QR code on watch screen but it didn't come with any information on what the app is called. After just typing in \"eurans watch app\" popped up a couple different but similar apps. The first one had me type in card info. I thought it was odd but like another review, just figured it'd be for further down the road quick purchases.... almost immediately I had a fraud alert pop up for $27.34. I immediately deleted the app. And have since tried the other similar app that had no set up options to link phone to watch. Photo is what pops up when I scanned the QR code. 0/10 recommend. $30 WASTED. DONT PURCHASR FROM THIS COMPANY",

I would recommend these watches for anyone who wants a quality watch at a great price.",
