                "reviewText": "Nice looking watch but my dad wanted one that he can talk to when responding to a phone call instead of texting. It's my fault I didn't read the whole description but you can respond to a phone call with auto-reply text built into the app. So far we like the faces, it's light e.t.c. The walking pedometer seems inaccurate because it shows so many steps that my mom took when she didn't walk that much. But I may be off I still need to retest it, we only had it for a week, so I will update it on accuracy. I will still give it a try and update this review. Customer service is excellent ! The sellers reached out to see if I received all three that I ordered. I am still using it to make a final review but so far it's good for the price.Looks attractive and has a lot of options on the dial. For this price point, it's fine. Takes a little long to sync or download a new face dial but that's normal.. I need to test the accuracy of the pedometer. I Love the breathing exercises, the fun watch faces the overall look of the watch and the price. I will update this review once I use the watch longer. We had it for a week so far. Battery life is great! Maybe 3 or 4 days before you charge it, which is good because my other Samsung smartwatch I have to charge every day or often... I will keep you all posted. It looks pretty like the apple watch but I'm not about to pay 300 400 dollars yet for a smartwatch.This one will do for now. Pressing the button on the side may be a little harder compared to my Samsung but again it's two different watches so at this price point IT'S GOOD ENOUGH even just as a watch.. vibration on the wrist is good, reminders for my mom's prayers are good, etc. Has a lot of features, training, etc. SO FAR SO GOOD. Packaging was nice too comes with a charger, the face of the dial is clear and can be adjusted for bright light or dim. Has timer, alarm, yoga option, etc. I bought three of these and will see. 2 in the pink and 1 in the black. I will update this after I've used it longerUPDATED REVIEW JUNE 2023. Fantastic. I've had this watch for a year now. I bought one for my mom, myself. BatterIy life is great! 3 days without charging. The price is great for the value and quality. I get hourly reminders for water breaks and when I'm inactive. There's also an oxygen saturation feature. My mom just uses it for basics but I use it for the pedometer, the water reminders, the breaks reminders, and the time. I used this a lot. Easy to charge. It may be a little challenging syncing up to the phone but it does sync with the app. The style of the faces is nice too. Other watches like the Apple ones are overpriced. This was a good deal. I use it all the time. It looks good too. It serves my needs. I bought one in pink and black. I used the computer a lot and it's nice to have a reminder to drink water or when remind me to move a bit after being sedentary. It has other features, but I mainly use it for the pedometer, reminders, time, ease, and having a lighted watch when it's dark so I can tell time. There are also breathing exercises. timed. It's light on my wrist. Doesn't feel heavy. I used to have the Samsung Gear watch and the battery drains so fast. This one it's 3 days. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT WATCH FOR THE PRICE, FUNCTION, BATTERY LIFE, STYLE, FEATURES. Try this before trying all those fancy high-priced smartwatches. This is practical for the price. You don't need to spend so much money on those other watches when this one does pretty much the same basic features. It's a practical choice. Simple features but important features for your lifestyle. Sometimes simplicity is better. I feel good about the choice I made because I saved money and yet have a practical, good-working smart watch for my needs. It's been a year now and still works well. Nice screen too.",

                "reviewText": "I've reviewed the Sirius model and this Venus model is even better! Same lightness, comfortable band with a slightly larger and higher definition screen. I didnt think I'd like the round screen but it's so sharp and clear other brands now just look grainy to me. Excellent battery life and relatively accurate measurements of heart rate, SPO2, steps, etc.It also adds a very convenient set of responses for texts. You can choose 1 of 5 different messages you establish in the app as a reply to a text. The music control allows you to also control volume. Many of the competitors fail on this feature. I do wish it had a calendar, ideally with sync to your phone but no watch I tried does this. The phone app is acceptable and has a lot of watch faces you can choose from.It does not have features that cannot work! There is no BP, body temperature or phone calling. Many watches offer these features for more money but I've tried more than 20 different ones....they don't work or are highly inaccurate. They are also bulkier and heavier and have lower quality screens.This watch has great features and delivers them with teriffic quality at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "This watch is maybe a little TOO responsive to \u201craise to wake\u201d sometimes, while other times (rarely) doesn\u2019t wake when you raise your wrist to check the time. In the latter case, you can just press a button to turn on the display. In my opinion, having an option to wake when you tap the screen instead of raising your arm might be a better fit.It measures your heart rate constantly during \u201csport\u201d mode, and takes a reading at regular intervals the rest of the time. You can change the frequency in the settings, starting at 5 minutes. It can also measure your blood oxygen level manually, but doesn\u2019t have an automatic reading setting. In my opinion, having it able to be set to automatic, even if only two or three times daily, would be even better.You can connect the watch data to Google Fit through the TouchElex app, and then set Google Fit as the pedometer in Noom, in order to use the watch with Noom. It would be easier if you could just connect the watch or app directly to Noom instead of going through Google Fit, but you can\u2019t expect every app to be able to connect to every other app, so having a third-party app every relevant app is connected to and being able to share the data that way is pretty awesome.You can\u2019t talk to people or listen to music on the watch, but I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to. You can see messages and even emails if you want to, or turn it off if you don\u2019t. You can choose your own watch face based on your own preferences, or even use an actual photo as the background. Can track sleep cycle. Probably can do more things.This is written the day after I received the watch. Battery life is looking good, right on track for about seven days before it reaches zero. I\u2019ve recorded my sp02 at least three times today, and will likely record it again later, so I may be eating up the battery life a bit faster than normal use. I also changed the timeout setting to 10 seconds instead of 5.First fitness watch I\u2019ve actually liked, and it\u2019s affordable. Way to go, developers.",
