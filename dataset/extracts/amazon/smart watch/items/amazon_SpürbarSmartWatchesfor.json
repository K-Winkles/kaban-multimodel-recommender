                "reviewText": "This fitness tracker has all of the elements of anything you want to track and more. I've only had for a week so far, so this is a limited perspective review. I am still learning all of the functions there are so many things you can do.Likes: The size and ease of use. You can use the app to determine what you want to have visible on the watch. I like being able to use Alexa (no service required), set alarms, see weather, read text messages, know who's calling, monitor my heart rate, monitor my stress level, and take timeout for deep breathing sessions.Uncertainties: the accuracy of the fitness tracker (calories and steps). The battery lasted about 3 days before I needed to charge it. The more features used might be the reason the battery drains faster (not sure, but will continue to monitor)Dislikes: the connection is lost from phone to watch from time to time. The sleep monitor is definitely not accurate. I was up one night and it recorded I was sleep for 9 hrs, but I was awake.I will provide an update after 90 days once I learn how to use more features.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying that I owned a Fossil Sport Watch for a few years, before one of the charging bands fell of the back it and it to be a real pain to charge reliably. While this isn't a WearOS watch, I decided to give it a try and see how it compared - For only $19.99, how could I go wrong? Well, let me tell you, with the exception of it not being a WearOS watch, this Sp\u00fcrbar Smart Watch ticks all the right boxes and performs flawlessly! Correct time always shown, fitness info readily available and easily updated, reliably always shows my emails, messages, phones calls, and usual Google Android notifications, including sounds to get your attention. I can even deal with phone calls through the watch! Honestly, this is a heck of a lot of features for the price! I've been using it every day for at least 4 days now, and the battery life is at 73%. I like the charging cable, as it provides a positive, strong magnetic connection. It also connects with the VeryFit app without any issues, and then are many options available in the app, including additional watch faces, which seem to be added to on a regular basis. Highly recommended, if this is the kind of thing your're looking for and you don't want to spend an arm and a leg.",

All she said to me when I asked her a question (\"Alexa what time is it?\") was, \"I don't know that\". There was no way to reset the activity functions so if I didn't make 10,000 steps in one day, it picked up where it left off the next day. I downloaded selected contacts, but it only showed a few favorites. There was a keyboard to enter phone numbers manually, but who knows them? It did display the time, and I did get notifications when I got texts and emails. My husband was able to call me and I could answer it and talk to him. This little trinket was returned.",
