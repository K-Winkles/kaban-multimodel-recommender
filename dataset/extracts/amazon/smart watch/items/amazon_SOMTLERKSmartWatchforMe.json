Then a week ago the watch stopped working. Tried everything until I needed to reboot the watch. Then once I did, the watch worked good. But every 2 days I need to reboot the watch to start working properly.... how annoying! So I stopped using it.I really like this watch. Everything works as describes. I even like the feature you can talk on the phone thru the watch. Can't text on it but that doesn't bother me. Great purchase!",
