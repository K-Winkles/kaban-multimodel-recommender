                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good Starter Smart Watch......Update January 4, 2024 Sleep Function Problem Discovered",
                "reviewText": "Today, 1/4/2024, I believe I finally discovered why my sleep function would come and go overthe past year. Since my last update, nearly 6 months ago, I have had a couple of additional \"No Data\" experiences, when trying to determine how well I slept the previous night. I tried everything, even moved the watch to my other wrist and still the problem. I did clear the cache memory again for this app on my phone and was about to hit the reset button which would have erased all my exercise and sleep history, when it occurred to me.It was a simple problem which had nothing to do with the app or the watch itself. About 5 months ago the wrist band strap, which prevents the wrist band itself from flapping at the end, had broken. I replaced it with an older wrist band strap, from another watch, which stopped the flapping, but it was still loose up and down the band. I compensated by tightening the watch band 1 or 2 notch holes. This prevented the flapping but it apparently was too tight for the sensor to monitor my circulation sleep data at night. When I returned to the original notch hole position, sure enough.....sleep data this morning. Pretty sure this was the problem. I will use a tighter watch band strap. So I am changing my review to 5 stars today.......excellent value and information for a $30 starter smart watch. Just don't squeeze it too tight around your wrist.********************************************************************************Today, 6/18, the Sleep Function data from last night showed up this morning. I am not sure why. This is the first Sleep Data that got to my HerobandIII app since 5/14/23.The only thing I did last night was charge the watch up to a full 100%. I will now give it a 4* rating.********************************************************************I never thought I would need or want a smart watch. However, as I got older, I wanted something to keep track of my health functions, especially sleep, HR, BP, and exercise data, walking 3-5 times per week. So I found this $30 Kalinko, and figured why not give it a try. I knew it wouldn't be as accurate against standard monitors or other smart watches ,but at least is was mobile. So my expectations were very low to begin with. If it was junk, so be it, and I would spend a little more to get a watch that would give me a higher level of performanceI now have read many of the other reviews, especially the 1 or 2 stars to find out what others have been upset about compared to the one and only problem I have had so far.First, some facts I learned along the way and data to do a level set:1. I purchased my Kalinko P22 in late December, 20222. The basic HR, BP, and O2 measurements are not accurate (10-20% lower) because the accelerometer the Chinese manufacturer uses is very basic in order to improve their profit margin for inexpensive retail price you pay. However, THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT, believe it or not. What is important are the measurement changes you see in the history log. The differences will give you a trend line against previous measurements. Don't compare it to other more accurate devices like BP monitors and cuffs or other instruments at the doctor's office. Even those only give you single data points, and no trend lines good or bad.3. I believe the Steps function is not a measurement of your walking or physical steps with your feet. Think of it as an \"Activity\" monitor. It measures movement of your right or left wrist, even at night , when you toss and turn in your sleep or get up to do normal functions that wake you up. I set daily goal steps to 10,000 steps, which is just about right for my age and activity level.4. Don't expect and help from this Chinese manufacturer. No phone or email and expect poor english if you do get a hold of someone. Most Chinese products have little help available as I found out with their remote cameras and other products. The best you can do is download their User Guide which is still substandard but better than nothing. Also, the included setup guide is so small (font size 1 or 2) you can't read it.. I had to copy it to my printer and increase the copy size by 50%.5. Don't buy this watch for yourself or someone that is not good with IT. If you want the full function bluetooth hookup with the HerobandIII App on your smart phone, you must have a smart phone and understand QR codes to perform the link. Otherwise you will just get the watch functions with no exercise or sleep data history which is kept on the phone6. Keep this watch on most of the time unless you are taking a shower, swimming, or in water. If you have a regular watch, keep the Kalinko, on your other wrist, hopefully on the hand you use the most. You will get use to it. The rubber band is basic. Still have my original but you can get fancier ones if you want.7. The battery is good and lasts me normally around 7 days before I charge it up at 20%. The magnetic contacts are a little weird and it's easy to lose contact with the watch. Look for the dashed green lights that indicate \"charging\" and finally \"charging complete\" and 100% Don't move the watch while charging. Normally takes about 2-3 hours for me with the USB plugged into one of my computer ports.8. The night light Torch function. An unexpected surprise at night or dark places is the single watch button turns on a very bright face light to find things and places without a flashlight or light switch. It gives you about 5 seconds to locate anything within 5 feet.9. Don't care about other functions like weather or remote control for camera shots or messages or music. The Find Phone option might be helpful if you misplace it nearby. ItSo, why just 3 stars?1. It's a beginner smart watch for $30. It's ok, and I might just keep it until I find a more accurate or reliable one for $200 or more.2. I am an avid walker and hiker. The Exercise function has never failed me for this type of exercise. I can go back to December 2022 history on the watch and get information as to how much I have progressed on the same walks and hikes showing, HR, miles, and how they rate for my age on standard, weight loss, aerobic, and anaerobic functions. This gets a 5 * rating and worth the $30 all by itself.3. The Sleep Function is the most important function for me. It is the only function which you don not have to manually start and stop with the watch. It depends on the quality and accuracy of the accelerometer on you wrist. It worked perfectly for 137 nights from December until mid-May. It gave me good info on total sleep time, deep sleep, and times I woke up during the night. Even a sleep quality score. Then nothing with a \"No Data\" message when I woke up on the 138th morning. The User Guide says it is possible that individual sleep apps can lose data if you don't clear the cache memory on the HerobandIII app on the smart watch. This had to be it, I thought. So I cleared the cache of the 7.8 mb, which should have cleared the problem. However, it didn't and I still have all the sleep history on a calendar going back to December, but No Data for the past 2 weeks. The only other option would be to clear the data or reset the watch which defeats the history I want to keep. Not sure what else I can do, and no response from their \"helpdesk\" email address, or even their app developer. So a 1* for me on this watch on this aspect.Final Summary.Unless the Sleep Function \"No Data\" can be restored, no more Kalinko $30 specials for me. I willonly use this watch for Exercise History, Health Trend, and the torch function for seeing in darkareas at night. If anyone else has solved the Sleep Function \"No Data\" problem. Please document.Thanks.",

                "reviewText": "100% real reviewIf you're anything like me, then I know you're having a hard time trying to decide on a good, cheap smartwatch. There are sooooo many to choose from and you don't want to get a crappy made watch. You want good quality and cheap price. THIS IS IT!!I've had a few I bought off Amazon and each time I was disappointed in my purchase...You don't really know what you're gonna get until it actually arrives in the mail. Seller pictures don't help a lot because some sellers show the watch from angles that make it hard to determine if it's a good watch or not.I bought one a couple years ago that looked great in the pictures but once I got it, I couldn't believe how bad it was. It was so big it looked like one of them round tobacco containers that rednecks carry. It barely had any functions and the battery would only last a day. So now I'm really cautious when buying a new smartwatch.I bought a different one right before this purchase. The functions were really limited and it cost the same as this Kalinco smartwatch purchase so I decided to return it and bought this watch. LET ME TELL YOU...I was soooo surprised by this watch. It's actually a really awesome watch. Due to health issues there are certain functions I was looking for. The one I returned had a heartbeat monitor but nothing else that I thought it had. Then I seen this watch. It has almost all the functions I need and it's the same price. Not only does it have a heart rate monitor but it also checks blood pressure and blood oxygen levels. To find all three of those functions in one watch is easy but they all cost double or triple the price of this. Then add all the other functions this has...YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS PRICE!!This watch isn't big and bulky like most... The screen looks great and has a great response time... The battery last exactly how long they say it will. (Maybe even a little longer depending on your use.) It has all the functions for an active lifestyle. It even has a sleep monitor!! I highly recommend you give this watch a try. If you read some of the different smartwatch reviews, you'll see some people complain that certain functions don't work then they complain about the quality of the watch. What they don't realize is that it's not the watch... IT'S THEIR PHONES!!9 times outta 10 it's because their phone is low end and not good enough for the watches.I read some saying that about this watch but I guarantee it's not the watch. I have a higher end Samsung and every function of this KALINCO smartwatch works perfect.So if you want a great smartwatch and you have limited money to spend, then try this first. I guarantee you'll like it.What do you have to lose at such a low price point?",

Auch die Blutdruckmessungen,Sauerstoffgehalt stimmen genau \u00fcberein, sowie die Schritte.Eine Anzeige \u00fcber eingegangene Anrufe sofort sichtbar.Leider kann man keine Anrufe t\u00e4tigen, d.h. zur\u00fcckrufen vom Smartphone aus.Habe es zur\u00fcckgesendet, da es in der falschen Farbe geliefert wurde, es kam in kupfer an, statt gold.Aber klare Kaufempfehlung, super Preis- Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis",
