                "reviewText": "So, when purchasing this watch, my husband and I were hoping it would help us track our daily steps and monitor our health with the click of a button. What we didn't know was that we could choose our own watch face design (there are so many options to choose from!) , and we can also make/receive calls and have phone conversations with the watch! How great is that!!! My husband and I love this watch! It's fantastic! It syncs with Google Fit and also with other health tracking apps. It's also very easy to use! All in all, I give it 5 stars and it seems to be fairly accurate as far as pedometers go. It also monitors sleep. The only thing I wish about this watch is that the bands could be replaced. Other than that, definitely worth the price!",

It functions very well in the water while swimming and any other physical endurance activity you might encounter. My favorite apps are the reminder notifications for sitting too long, drink water, alarm clock, and every other app. I guess I like them all. The battery last for days literally days. Don't pass up this deal it's a very competitive price compared to other brands.",
