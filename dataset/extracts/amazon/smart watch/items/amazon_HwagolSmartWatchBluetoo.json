                "reviewText": "I purchased a total of 8 of these for Christmas gifts. I bought 3 black, 3 purple and 2 red. Out of the ones received thus far, all 3 black ones have messed up screens. I opened them to charge them up so they would be ready to use when opened at Christmas but so far these 3 in Black are useless with the screens looking like they have been squished or something since they aren't damaged on the outside, nor was the box damaged in any way, plus the shipping box had adequate airpillow packaging, so I just must've been like so many others that got DUDS!If they worked, they seem like decent smart watches, especially for kids that don't take care of the pricey name brand smart watches but they're useless if the screens are messed up.I have 3 purple and 2 red still to be delivered, so I will await those additional 5 to come in and check them and send back all that are not working.What a shame since they seem decent for the price, especially with 2 bands to select from. That's usually only seen on higher end smart watches.But it is what it is. I took a chance with hopes of getting cool Christmas gifts for older kids but as is usually my luck, I got the duds like so many others have.More stuff to return unfortunately \ud83d\ude15 I hate when stuff like this happens since it drives costs up due to returns but I won't take the loss and just toss them, especially with 5 more on the way.All 8 were ordered at the same time so why they're shipped separately is a waste of resources in my opinion.IF COMPANY WOULD HAVE SOMEONE DOING QUALITY CONTROL BEFORE SO MANY OF THESE GO OUT DEFECTIVE, IT WOULD BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN AND CUSTOMERS WOULD BE MUCH HAPPIER TO GET A WORKING PRODUCT STRAIGHT FROM THE BOX!!!!-----> BECAUSE OF THIS, I CANNOT RECOMMEND THESE WATCHES AT ALL. NOT WHEN THEY CANT EVEN FUNCTION AS A SIMPLE WATCH DUE TO THE MESSED UP SCREEN, WHICH IS AN INTERNAL ISSUE SINCE THE EXTERIOR ISNT DAMAGED <----",

That is even though I would charge it every day while I showered and I seldom used any of the other functions. I was also never able to get it to sync with my phone for more than a few minutes. I would go through the process only to find a few minutes later that it was no longer synced.So if you're looking for a beautiful Orange watch this one will do for a few days. After that, you better get it on the charger!",
