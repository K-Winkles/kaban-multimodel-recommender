I thought the silver would have been metal but it not. It still looks nice. It has the man in features that I wanted. Step monitor and calorie tracking. I\u2019m just getting use to the other features. I love the fact that you can change the watch face and personalize it. It very lightweight. I also like that it shows my emails and text messages. The big screen is great for bigger fingers. All in all, it\u2019s definitely worth the price. One thing I didn\u2019t expect but I do like, it syncs up to the Fitness App on IPhone. I\u2019ve had the hardest thing using the Fitness App because I have to have the phone on me when I exercise but now with this watch, it updates the Fitness app and I can actually complete my daily goals.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent value for money and with more useful features than many more expensive watches. I have found its various measurements to be accurate - heart rate compared to a cuff blood pressure device. The Alexa voice is surprisingly clear considering the size of the speaker and the microphone sensitive, so you don't have to shout at the watch. Always embarrassing. I have found the strap comfortable to wear. Downsides? It is a big watch, so smaller people may not like this. However, the face is large and easy to read, so you can't really have it both ways. A second problem was pairing the watch to my phone. The app said to look for the watch's Bluetooth address, but it never appeared. What did show up was the watch name - ID Sport01 BT. But it still would not pair. I had to reset my Bluetooth on the phone and then the watch paired perfectly and has not dropped the connection. The pairing process could be easier and better explained. Apart from this niggle the watch has been one of my better purchases from Amazon.",
