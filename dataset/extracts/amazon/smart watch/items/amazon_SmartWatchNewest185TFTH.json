Uses it daily. He recommended to some friends and they purchased one also. It more than meets his needs. We are impressed with the watch for the inexpensive price. Many features are comparable to more expensive watches. Outgoing/incoming calls, receives text messages, monitors heart rates, calculator, camera, weather, pedometer and more. It has a nice bright screen. Quite a long battery life that lasts several days. It\u2019s was an easy setup with the app on a Samsung s20. Only downside is that it cannot send text messages. But not a problem since he would rather send them from his phone. This smart watch is beyond expectations.",

The watch feels smooth with a nice mate finish. The band is very comfortable. Battery is amazing. I have used it two full days and it still shows almost full bar. Phone call is seamless with good volume. I can customize the notifications to include email, messages, individual apps. Alarm works fine. It will be perfect if the alarm can be snoozed after its set off. Over two dozen watch faces can be selected. Sometimes I want it techie, and other times I want it classy. No problem. Continuously heat rate monitoring is a plus. I also like the navigation. Just swipe from one of the four edges and it will bring up the menus accordingly.If you on a budget, don't care a name brand, and don't want to charge the watch every day, this is a safe choice.

                "reviewText": "I've had this watch for a couple days and I'm sending it back. Though it's paired with my phone, the watch keeps saying it's not paired. Some of the things like watch faces could be changed with the app, but it wasn't paired to see the weather or play music and gives a pairing error.The first time I set it up I could see the weather. The next day I looked again and it showed the weather for another state. No matter what I did I couldn't get it to change back. I checked the IP on my phone and it was correct. My location and GPS were on. Finally I reset the watch, that's when things really went bad. Every time I tried to look at the watch face it kept making me pick my language. Then it would tell me to download the app to my phone and wouldn't let me go any further. I reset this watch over and over and it was just stuck. I rebooted my phone, I unpaired and repaired the watch. I restarted the watch. Nothing worked.I had the screen protector on it and I couldn't get the touch screen to really work either. Nothing would slide. I was afraid I'd break the watch, since I had to press so hard.You can only store one watch face in the watch. To change the face, you have to use the app in your phone. You can make your own face with the digital time but you can't crop the picture so the placement of the time might cover the picture. You can't use your own picture with a watch face with hands. You can't slide the time with your finger to place it where you want. It gives you the option of using the corners or the middle. The time digits can't be resized.Overall I just wasn't satisfied. I think it was dying. Buy at your own risk.",

And the alarm works well.The Bluetooth communication between phone and watch works very well and the speaker is very good.The battery is great - charges quickly and holds that charge for days.The safety screen protector is a nice addition, and it does not hinder the use of the touchscreen.This watch is very customizable.

It was one of the reasons I wanted a smart watch. Several days the watch did not send/save my pedometer data and it was gone forever. The app is basic, but options are disappointing. I reloaded the app and went through all the steps that tech support said, but the watch just won't show texts. It does connect and show FB messages though. .

I get phone notifications, messenger or TikTok notifications, and so on. I even got some family and friends around me to go and buy one since they've seen our watches. Shipping was really fast and efficient as well.I highly recommend this watch as it's serving us really well. 5 stars for sure.",
