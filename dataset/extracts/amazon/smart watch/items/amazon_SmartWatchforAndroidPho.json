It has a couple of games on it that weren't really to her liking, but she was just excited for the step counter and the ability to record sound and play music on it. It was a little big for her wrist, but she does run on the smaller side. The sound recording was alright, but she liked it no matter the quality. The watch itself was pretty well made and had no issues with charging or battery life. It seemed to get a day or two of battery life which is pretty amazing for something like this. The touch screen is responsive, but just don't expect $300 smart watch smoothness when going through the menu. It's great for kids.",

There is a healthy diversity of watch faces to choose from, and setting it up with my Galaxy phone was no problem. I don't think the watch actually has a 7 day battery life unless we are talking about running it with the absolute minimum amount of features. That might actually be how they determine the battery duration of these devices, but in terms of practical use, I think the battery will last more like 4 or 5 days for the most part. I haven't tests all the features, but the heart rate monitor is accurate as well as the blood oxygen measurement. The Alexa feature allows you manage notifications using voice control. This watch can also be adjusted for 100 different sports modes whereas other watches of this variety sometimes only offer 20 sports modes. I was skeptical that this watch might be able to withstand the water exposure of a swim, but, sure enough, it did. No problems wearing this in the shower or when washing my hands. Overall, a solid choice for this price.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this watch for my granddaughter, who is 12 years old. As such, she doesn't make use of most of the features it offers.Setting it up is a fairly straightforward process. It easily paired with her phone, and she found a watch face she liked\u2014there are plenty to choose from. Notifications from her phone are displayed on the watch, although she hasn't quite figured out if it's possible to respond to texts or emails from the watch. For the most part, she's using it as a simple extension of her phone, as she's young enough that she doesn't really care about step counts or exercise tracking, given her active lifestyle.Nevertheless, this watch strikes a balance\u2014it's basic enough for a youngster to navigate but seems to have many additional features that adults might find appealing.Pros:\u2022 Easy setup.\u2022 Phone alerts are conveniently displayed on the watch.\u2022 A wide variety of watch faces to choose from.\u2022 Offers numerous functions that a youngster might not use but could be useful for an adult.Cons:\u2022 None that I could find.My Take: I would recommend this as an excellent starter watch for kids. However, if you're accustomed to using an Apple Watch and then try this, you might not be entirely satisfied.Additional Info:As a Vine reviewer, I'm aware of the influence my reviews can have on fellow consumers. Just like you, I rely on reviews when making my own purchasing decisions. Therefore, I'm committed to providing valuable insights to those considering the products I review. Additionally, given that I'm obliged to pay taxes on the retail value of the products I receive (approximately 40%, with 15.3% in Social Security/Medicare taxes and 25% in Federal Income taxes), I prioritize delivering honest reviews for every item I receive.For reference, here's how I rate products:- 1 Star: Do not buy. This item has serious flaws.- 2 Stars: Do not buy. Not as bad as a 1 Star, but it still has major downsides.- 3 Stars: Buy if you can't find an alternative. There are some issues that need to be worked out.- 4 Stars: Recommend purchase. This item met my expectations.- 5 Stars: I love this product.",

                "reviewText": "Took me while to get used to it as I've never had a smart watch. In fact I haven't worn a watch for a number of years, so I thought I would give it a try as they are so popular now. When I look at the prices of brand name watches, they are 5 - 10 times the price of this one, and I have always tended to be hard on watches in the past, I didn't want to be constantly worrying about damaging a watch while just going through everyday life. I wore it 24/7 and things like showers and washing dishes didn't seem to have any effect, which is good! It's a bit larger than I expected, but compared to many others I have seen people wearing, it's one of the smaller ones. As a former analogue watch wearer, I was used to quickly glancing at my wrist to check the time, which was not possible with this one (maybe its the same delayed response for all smart watches?). That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. If I didn't twist my wrist fast enough, the display would not light up. And then when I did, I had to wait 2 seconds until the display came alive. So, it just seems odd to me that I have to plan ahead to check the time. I sort of got used to it once I realized why the time wasn't showing when I expected it to.But it is handy to know what my heart rate is at any time and how many steps I've taken, without having to open up google fit on my watch. I managed to get 10 days out wearing it before needing to recharge, which is more than the 7 days advertised. However, I didn't use the notification feature for phone calls, text messages, etc. as I don't need to be that \"connected\" all the time and I worry about the app privacy and security. I use \"signal\" app for messaging and I didn't see that available on the VeryFit app anyways, so I didn't pursue that feature.Overall, a very functional timepiece with fitness and communication features as you wish!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great entry level smartwatch that pairs easily with my iPhone device. Its sleek design and waterproof build make it both fashionable and durable. The ability to make phone calls directly from the watch and the integration of several key apps elevate its convenience, while the inclusion of a pedometer, health monitor, sleep tracker provide a holistic approach to fitness and well-being. I find the pedometer is accurate though the heart rate monitor was a little off but only by a few BPMs.The software is easy to use but pretty basic and a bit clunky compared to my apple watch software but for the price this is easily forgiven.I haven't swam with this watch yet but I have gotten in the tub with it and there was no problem with it after.The band is a nice silicone rubberized material and feels premium and durable.In terms of battery life, I find I only need to recharge it every 7 days or so but depends on usage with my usage being pretty lite. Still its much longer than my other smartwatches which I usually need to recharge every second day.If I had one complaint is that the LCD screen doesn't have the highest refresh rate and you can definitely see the pixels (is not a retina display). For the price though this is understandable!",

                "reviewText": "There are many entry-level smart watches on the market, and, in my experience, they are all very similar. This one works and performs like many of the others I have tried in this value-range.I do have a name-brand smart watch and can compare them. This seems fairly close to the measurements on my Fitbit. Of course, I cannot say which is correct, if either, as I have no other way of measuring these stats, aside from steps/distance on my treadmill. Unfortunately, I am still healing from a broken foot, so unable to go for a walk to test this out at this time, but for my daily steps, it seems as accurate as any I have used.My sleep is comparable to my other device, the steps seem similar, heart rate, virtually the same too.It is very responsive with message notifications and emails. My alarm woke me up this morning on time. The battery life is exponentially better than my Fitbit. It looks sharp.The pink on pink color I wasn't sure of when I ordered it, but I kind of like it when wearing it. I am not a fan of any of these silicone bands and I will change this out for something more comfortable to me. There is nothing wrong with the band. It is actually softer and more comfortable than some others I have tried. It is a personal preference.The on-deck watch faces can be changed easily from the app. Connection to the app was easy and quick. It doesn't take a tech expert to figure out. It uses the same app as some of my other devices, but when I paired this one, it automatically made this my primary watch.It definitely looks a lot more high-end than the price would suggest.Overall, I like it and think it is a good value and worth a try! I hope you find this helpful.",

If I am doing something where I do not want to activate the watch while my arm is in use, I can turn off the wake gesture sensor. The pedometer keeps me aware of my activity level during the day, I find this very useful compared to using my phone as I find exercise while carrying a phone to be cumbersome rather than useful. The sleep tracker gives me the ability to track more accurately the amount and quality of sleep I get at night. Having the weather on my wrist is also really nice, though I do wish I could choose the app or the source of the forecast.I also really like the ability to customize my list of watch displays from the app, and then change them on the watch to suit my mood. I can choose a more classic watch face for every day use, or I can switch to a more digital display that contains all the fitness data I need for quick checks. The battery has a very long life, I am very impressed with it!",
