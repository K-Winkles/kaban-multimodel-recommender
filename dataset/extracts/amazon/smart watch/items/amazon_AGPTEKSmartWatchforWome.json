                "reviewText": "How much I miss when they used to put a quarter or a dollar next to the product to get a feel of the actual size.Okay, I just got this phone and I'm getting about 30 ft of bluetooth range going through one thick plaster wall. Not bad for the price. The smartwatch is really light. It's a minimalist watch. It's not too loud or screams for attention. It's simple, quiet, kind and gentle to the eyes.I added a small screen protector because I work with glass and I always have glass powder on my hands. So that weird round circle you see on top of the watch glass is the screen protector.The watch bands are easy to install. I uploaded a picture pointing to the little latch that you will need to pull when you install the watch bands.\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4dIf you are a nurse, driver or work at a counter or office this phone is perfect. It has a setting to adjust the vibrating alert levels.The \"find my phone\" feature is pretty cool! There are small remotes (TILE i have one) they sell that a person can attach to their keychain and helps them find their phone. They cost around $30. You're getting that feature for FREE with this smartwatch.Who can complain?We spend more on Chinese takeout compared to what I paid for this watch. Seriously guys!I get my text messages and calls instantly, at the same time my phone receives it with no lag. Of course that's if I'm within 30 ft.CONS:RANGE ALERTS NOTIFICATIONS:When the watch is out of range, it will disconnect from the phone and it will take anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 minute to reconnect itself when back in range. If a call or a text message comes in while out of range, it will not send the alert to the watch once you get back in range. You snooze you lose buddy! \ud83d\ude42Hopefully, they will put up an update for this. A few short simple codes on the app and watch will do it.\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4dBut like I said, even if nothing else works but the phone finder, text alerts, phone alerts, email alerts and the watch time, it's still worth it to me and I'm not kidding. You got all these extra features on the watch, like weather, timer, music, women health thingy (lol), heart rate monitor and many more... man this is a real steal guys!!C'mon! Let's be honest with ourselves!Will I ever get a more expensive watch?Absolutely!On Black Friday of course! \ud83d\ude01Why?Because by using this beautiful inexpensive watch just for work, I can see myself getting one when I'm not at working. One you can make calls and text from. But, I will definitely have an inexpensive \"work smartwatch\" from now on after this experience. That's of course, if the good Lord allows me.\ud83d\ude4fI will do another update in about 30-60 days (God willing) \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4dI will be talking about the battery, and any issues I encounter while using the phone and perhaps adjusting my rating if I need too.Shalom \ud83d\ude4f",

                "reviewText": "I was a little unsure about this item, but I\u2019m glad I bought it. The two main functions I wanted were step tracking and activity/water reminders. These two functions have been great, but I am pleasantly surprised by the watch overall. It looks nice and holds a charge forever. I haven\u2019t recharged it again yet and I got it a 8 days ago. I do like the many activity tracking options. You won\u2019t get everything but there is a good spread of activities, including yoga! I like that I can see a text and decide if I want to deal with it. Love checking the weather and my HR. Was surprised by the BP option and it seems accurate. I didn\u2019t get all scientific or anything but it reads what I would expect. I run very low and that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from the watch. For the price I am very happy.For cons, it\u2019s not super fancy or overloaded with options. The app is ok. Again, you\u2019re not going to get a lot of options or tracking info. As a matter of fact, it doesn\u2019t even do anything with your exercise tracking other than to list it. So if you want more than that, look elsewhere. It does do some graphing with your steps by day, week and month. You can set a minimum step goal each day and you get a star for reaching your goal.Honestly, now that I have this one and I know I\u2019m using it I may want something with more options in the future. But this is a great, stylish start. The watch has kept me very motivated so if you are looking for that at a basic level, buy!Other: I haven\u2019t used the sleep function. I don\u2019t sleep with technology on. The timer is limited. It\u2019s not like your phone, but there are about 6 options.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this smart watch a couple months ago, and I wanted to wear it and use it for a while before I wrote my review. This is the first smart watch I've ever owned, so my review isn't going to be a comparison with other smart watches, just the pros and cons of this one.The main selling point for me was the price, considering all the features of this watch. This watch is affordable for people on a budget, but it doesn't look cheap. I did purchase the matching metal mesh band separately (I've seen it bundled with the watch as well), because of the poor reviews of the included pink silicone band.The health monitoring features (heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen) seem to be pretty accurate. You can set the watch to regularly monitor these things within the FitCloud Pro app, and it will measure them at least once a day. The sleep tracker is pretty good, too. The only downside to that feature is that it only tracks sleep at night, so if you work the night shift and sleep during the day, it won't be of much use to you.There are 5 different watch faces to choose from on the watch itself, but there is a library of different watch faces within the FitCloud Pro app. They don't seem to be customizable, however.The watch is supposed to be water resistant, and I've worn it while washing my hands and washing dishes (not submerging the watch), but I take it off to bathe, shower, or swim. It doesn't seem to be affected by rain or sweat.I've been getting 2 weeks out of a full charge on the battery, and it takes about 2 hours to fully charge via the included magnetic USB charge cord. I did change the \"raise to wake\" feature to turn off between midnight and 6 a.m. (when I am usually asleep), which may contribute to longer battery life.You can link the watch to your smartphone to alert you to incoming calls, text messages, Facebook notifications, and Facebook Messenger messages, along with several other popular messaging apps. Text and Messenger messages will show a preview of the text, but not pictures. For incoming calls, it shows the number and/or contact name, but you can only decline calls from the watch. To answer, you have to use your phone. I have not tried using it to control music from my phone, but that is a feature.The FitCloud Pro app is okay, although I had a bit of trouble \"binding\" the watch to the app on my phone at first. For my purposes, it works fine. It keeps a running record of the health & sleep trackers, which is handy.My main issue with the watch is it doesn't have an onboard battery indicator, except when the charger is initially applied, so you have to use the app to see approximately how much life is left (or whether it's charging). The app only gives a visual indicator, and not a percentage, though.Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase.",

Aconselho comprar uma pel\u00edcula pra o visor, pois nos dias que ele ficou sem, j\u00e1 surgiram arranh\u00f5es. As funcionalidades cumprem com o que quero.
