                "reviewText": "It\u2019s not an Apple Watch!And it\u2019s not claiming to be an Apple Watch!This is a fitness tracker, watch for people that hate smart watches. I\u2019ve had 2 Apple watches 2 different fitbits, and I own several analog brand-name watches (seiko, citizen, tag).I wanted to watch that would track my basic fitness stuff ( fitness, notifications, time, ) but not look terrible like pretty much all smart watches do. also I wanted a watch that I did not have to think about too much or bother charging every day like a smart watch.The citizens CZ , was pretty much exactly what I was looking for.A watch I could wear every day.A watch that tracks my Fitness stuffA watch I did not have to charge every dayPros:First. the watch looks great. I get people asking what kind of watches all the time.Second. It does a good job of keeping track of my steps, heart rate, 02, all the normal stuff that a fitness watch should do.Third. The battery has an insanely long life.(legitimately, I waited to write this review until I went through almost a full battery life cycle. It has been roughly 2 weeks and I\u2019m still at 14% battery life.!!!!)Fourth. I love the fact that you can change the watch face at Will or even add your own pictures or designs to make it 100% custom if you should wish.Cons.First. The YouQ app \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I would love to say whether it is bad or good, but I have yet to be able to get it to actually connect to the watch.(I don\u2019t think that is the watches fault as much as the apps fault. The app simply cannot find the watch over Bluetooth.) hopefully they will fix that some day.But\u2026 the Citizen Connected app does keep track of all of my fitness stats so I\u2019m not super concerned with theYouQ app \u2026 right now.Second. The one thing I have noticed with the watch is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily update your fitness scores on the watch face in real time..ie. heart rate, there seems to be a slight lag, of a couple of minutes. (hopefully that will be fixed with an update.)All in all, I like the watch. And will continue to wear it on a daily basis as my \u201cdaily beater watch\u201d.If you\u2019re looking for a smart watch that is \u201clike an Apple Watch\u201d then just go buy an Apple Watch. If you\u2019re looking for a smart watch that looks good ,does all the basic things you need and has a great battery life then this might be the ones you\u2019re looking for. IMO",

I own 2 Skagen hybrid smartwatches. I am very familiar with smartwatches.I love this great looking watch! It is a hybrid and does NOT behave like a traditional smartwatch. If you buy this watch you need to understand and embrace this simple fact! Once you take the time to understand the watch, what it DOES do and how it works you may love it as much as I do.Customer service is amazing! I had a question right away and used the app to send it. A few hours later I had an answer. The next morning I called their number and opted for them to call me back. I spoke to a VERY knowledgeable representative who answered any and all questions that I had.If you like wearing a great looking traditional watch with some features of a smartwatch buy this!",

                "reviewText": "I am giving this watch two stars because I really like the external design. But that is where my love ends. This watch has (in theory) what I wanted: a hybrid design so I can see the time all the time without having to activate the screen (and use battery power) and a minimalistic, B&W background with just the extra info that I need. Admittedly, setting up the watch and connecting it to my phone was a breeze. The main problem is that of all the nice watch faces that are offered, only two actually show the info. All the others (including those that I've customized to show what I actually wanted to see) were just black where the info was supposed to be. Therefore, it is useless. Adding to that pain, the backlight is supposed to be activated by double-tapping the screen. Well, it doesn't. I had to tap several times until the light came off, and then it was only for a couple of seconds. Enough to see the time, but not to read a message. They could have added a small button on the left to turn it on and off and some glow-in-the-dark paint to the watch so you don't have to turn the backlight on if you only want to see the time. Maybe they get it right on generation 3?",
