The reminders and notifications are subtle and actually useful, not annoying. Battery really does last 2 weeks. Accuracy of step counter is fantastic and the heart rate monitor works great. The app is polished and works great -- it's better than Google Fit. There are other features and modes that are more specific. And for $30? Just an incredible value.",

                "reviewText": "NEW UPDATE!! Ok so I got my Amazfit 5 watch 7 months ago. It still works fine...BUT HERE'S THE KICKER....I was gifted a fitbit charge 5 which retails around $119 at the moment..but I'm sure was higher upon release....anyways...I LOVE MY AMAZFIT MORE!! So much more. I love the details on the app better...and it's laid out way better. The amazfit alerts me to my heart rate over a certain limit..perhaps the fitbit does but it's so confusing at times...it seems to check heart rate periodically. Also on my amazfit 5 I can check my oxygen level anytime...fitbit only gives a reading after so many hrs of sleep... and that's it. Also I don't see anything about daytime naps...or details about sleep on the fitbit..although it tracks rem deep and light(I never got a rem reading on amazfit but that's fine) The amazfit isn't as big and bulky as the fitbit...it actually looks more sleek to me than the fitbit charge 5.....even though the face isn't as big...and the graphics are an (irrelevant) tad bit lower pixel than fitbit. I have showered with amazfit..with the fitbit you cant...the fitbit has a few features that amazfit doesn't like skin temp and afib measurer..but you actually have to initiate it(afib)...I don't even use these so no deal breaker...also...the fitbit has functions that seem to come with (amazfit for free) that you only get if you subscribe to premium on fitbit. So overall I love my 38 dollar watch...not sure of the price now...but a 38 dollar watch which you can buy multiple bands to switch it up... for under 15 bucks is, for me, a winner. The amazfit 5 never failed me. As a matter of fact I believe I will be putting IT back on..because I've been wearing this fitbit for a couple weeks and it's just not as good. It takes long to sync and seems to disconnect from blue tooth on my phone...and has repairing issues which are ongoing.. While I appreciate the present... I just had to let you guys know. Amazfit 5 is worth it... PS...I didn't get paid to say these things. It's just true. And as a second update to intial review...I could have just bypassed...but this Amazfit is def worth trying.This is an update to my poor review of the watch. It finally worked after I figured out I had to actually touch the pair first symbol. It then paired. The features are actually good for a low price watch and the screen although is little..works for me. I don't know how accurate it is but it seems ok. It alerts when you haven't moved lately so that's a plus. It also has a breathing exercise function which is useful. ..which guides your breathing for like a minute. Yeah I like the watch. Its an ok to good buy for me. However the company needs better directions. That way we know if it works or not. I know it may be an older watch..bit if people are still buying then we deserve a better manual. Not everyone is techsmart. I vocoder myself to be savvy and I had a heck of a time. So maybe better instructions. Overall great gift buy. Good watch. Nice price.",

My 1st one came with no instructions or owners manual. The 2nd one came properly packaged probably because I didn't get a discount for the 2nd amzifit. The steps are not as accurate as they should be. I walked 75 steps the other day and it said I walked zero. So the steps is not accurate. I did ask it to track my sleep because I have terrible sleep issues and it has not been tracking my sleep. I basically use it to keep an eye on my heartbeat, stress, and to get an idea of how much I have walked. I have the new one on my left arm however when I lift it it does not activate like its supposed to, however if I touch the screen it does come on. on a scale of 1-10 Id give it a 7. The price is affordable, if you can get it at the deals and steals price. The face is very difficult to read if you have to wear reading glasses you will need your lens handy all the time.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars WOULD RETURN BUT.... UPDATED REVIEW",
                "reviewText": "****UPDATED REVIEW****So I am about a week or so from the last review.ONE cool thing I will note is that (at least on iPhone) there are widgets you can place on your phone screentop.I left off the last review on 1/27 with 57% battery, recently charge on 1/25.Battery died on 1/29, I charged it on 1/30. Wore my iWatch on 1/30 and 1/31.Put the Amazefit Band on 2/1. It's 2/3 (8am) I am at 51%.As I've mentioned previously aside from the original charge, I've had to sync up with the app every time for all the feature to work/work properly. This is highly annoying.The last 2 charging times, the band is not syncing or remaining synced.For example it's telling me it's 60/64 degree's and sunny, sorry its 43 degree's (65/40) and raining.Or it's told me I haven't walked at all - literally 0 (ZERO) steps today - I've been up wrangling kids for the bus since 5am. Three hours I haven't taken a single step? When did I learn to fly? My iPhone pedometer which hasn't even been on my person the whole time, has registered 218 steps.I have to open the app and swipe the sync for it to sync, it doesn't automatically do it.It's literally just NOT functioning in the basic capacity.And I'm about 3 days out of the return window.....of course.Guess my kids just got a new toy.Back to the have to charge every night iWatch. At least I can answer calls on it, and it has a calculator and memo recorder.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Has everything you want, maybe more so. Lacks accuracy.(Review is in compared to an iWatch.)The main reason I wanted a watch/band is: a watch, a pedometer, a rudimentary fitness tracker (including walking, treadmill, cardio and swimming), a sleep tracker (including duration, REM, # of times awaken during the night, and quality) & continuous heart rate monitor. The stress monitor would be a plus, but only useful if the information is recorded. And of course - and LONG battery life.Compared to the iWatch/iPhone technology, the AmazeFit Band 5 isWatch - Hello it's a watch - they both probably pull time from the NIST.Pedometer - Well not only did I measure the iWatch, the AmazeFit Band 5, the Xaomi Mi Band 6, the Garmin VivoActive 4S, and my Treadmill (ReeBok GT40x). I reviewed both steps and mileage. They were all wildly different. I ultimately chose the AmazeFit because it was the closest to meeting the treadmills numbers.However, after about 4 weeks, this band has become quite different than the treadmill. Almost 1/2mile to 3/4mile off from the treadmill. After each workout the band does let me calibrate the workout, and some times I can \"match\" it up to the mileage I did on the treadmill - but oftentimes I cannot match the total workout, which for me is very annoying. I didn't do all of that for nothing.* I am unaware of whether that only affects my \"workout\" mileage, or if it affects my daily step total also. I have not been able to see a correlation to daily steps - since that continues on through the day after my workout. (And the treadmill doesn't tell me steps, of course)** One other thing to note about the pedometer while in \"workout\" mode that really bothers me is that, if I am not CONTINUOUSLY swinging my arm it will go in to \"PAUSE\" mode and stop registering my movement. And I DO MEAN CONTINUOUSLY. Like if I literally just not swing my arm or if I take a sip of water or brush my hair out of my face I have use the hand that doesn't have the band or it will \"PAUSE\". That is very annoying.*** I have not had a chance to use it in the pool yet, so I cannot attest to its stroke counting or water durability.Rudimentary Fitness Tracker - I personally do not enjoy the presentation of the information in the APP.(I do not particularly enjoy it in iHealth either)Sleep Tracker - Again, the presentation in the APP is not ideal. I understand there are a lot of tid-bits presented. However, if you don't look at it each day, you are unable to view some pieces of information, such as REM, Times awake, Amount of Deep Sleep or Light Sleep. You can see they are there - just not the individual data. Which makes it redundant. When you select the date it only tells you the total amount of sleep for that day.Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring - As similar with other reports - if you don't check it that day and get whatever information you need, you wont be able to access. For today only, you can see what time your heart rate was at \"xyz,\" - but yesterday or any day prior you will only see the lowest and highest readings, with no timestamps. There are no alerts for spikes or dips either.Stress Monitor - I can manually run it on my band, but the APP doesn't recognize it. The last registered reading was 1/1/22.Battery Life - Finally the MAIN Reason I chose this, and did not continue on with my old iWatch. In late December it had a 15 day battery life.* You have to reconnect with the APP after each charge or some functions will not work, or sync back to the APP.My iWatch had buckled down to about 18hours of battery charge, which was useless to me and with it's pedometer seemingly unfixable with every re-calibration trick tried, I was ready to move on. This was approximately $40, it had a \"15day\" battery life, it was the closest pedometer accuracy I could find and the app wasn't terrible. As of late January, 4 weeks later - I have had to charge this band 3 times.Charged when received 12/28wore AmazeFit Band 12/29 - 1/13, (14 days)charged 1/14, wore the iWatch.wore AmazeFit Band 1/15-1/24, (10 days)charged 1/25, wore the iWatch.1/26- (2 days and at 57% currently).* It does NOT take all day to charge, I just did not want to interrupt my step count once the day started by change watches midday.** I do not know, nor assume that it is a trend, that the battery life will continue to drop. It's only been 2 charges post full usage, so a lot of factors go in to that. I let the battery drain completely down, because I understand that it the best way to preserve the battery. If this is a significant trend I will update.Conclusion:As most people say - it's a good watch for $40. Don't expect an iWatch or a Garmin. Don't ever expect to compare a $40 item to a $300 item. That said if you're frustrated with the APP or interfaces of iPhone or Garmin or Samsung and want something more straight forward this could work. Or if your resigned to not be fully on board with anything/everything, then you'll be happier to pay less at less for a fully functional (in the overall sense) product such as this than paying gobbloads for Apple, Garmin, Samsung, etc. I will say this - I do like the construction of this product. I don't feel like I need to buy a protective layer for it or worry about my clumsiness. It's hearty and fits well on my wrist without being too bulky.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this tracker to replace an Honor band 5 thinking that it would be very similar- I was pleasantly surprised. After a week of testing, the accuracy of the band was on-par with the Honor Band 5 (similar retail price when I bought it, now replaced by the Honor band 6), but overall, it was easier to use and had more features (but also had more bugs and small issues). Overall, I slightly preferred the Amazfit due to it's feature set- it's a great tracker with awesome customizability, and the Alexa feature is very convenient (although a bit limited- no music playback or announcements).Pros:- Almost everything is customizable- what data to show, what shortcuts to have, reminders, what shortcuts you want to have, what's displayed on your watch face, etc.- Loaded with features (PAI, Steps, SpO2, HR, Sleep, breathing & stress, alexa, etc.)- Reasonably accurate for personal referenceCons:- Battery life only 5-7 days- enough, but not as advertised- No option to quickly reply to notifications- Lots of features require Bluetooth connection to phone (GPS, Alexa, etc.)- Setup is a bit complicated if you want to customization- Can't find option to link with Google Fit- Alexa processing and connection a bit slow, sometimes server is to busy to process requestsStarting off with the smartphone app, the Zepp app is a bit complicated, but once you get everything set up, it is surprisingly convenient and easy to use- the customization options allow you to customize almost everything about the band and app to your personal preference. The band itself, much like the app, is also very customizable- from what shortcuts you want to have, to what data is displayed on your watch face, although it did take me a few days to find the option to customize the data displayed on the watch faces (avalible for the 2 pre-loaded watch faces in more>band display>settings). You can also pick from many watch faces in the store. Alexa is also avalible on the band, but the feature set right now is a bit limited- no music playing or announcements. It is very convenient and nice to have for things like simple questions and reminders though. The rest of the band is pretty self explanatory- and reasonably accurate. There are some (nitpicky) flaws though- the battery life is not as advertised, and lots of the functionality (including GPS) relies on having a BT connection to your phone. Overall, it's a great tracker (and great value if priced around $50CAD), and the flaws are excusable because of it's low price- I don't think I'll need a smartwatch unless I need to make calls.",
