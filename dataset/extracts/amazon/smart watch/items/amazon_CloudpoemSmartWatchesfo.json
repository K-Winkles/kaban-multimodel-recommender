                "reviewText": "I only use this as a fitness tracker, and not a smartwatch, so I can't speak to smartwatch functions (like notifications/device control integration.) However, I have owned 2 other 'budget smartwatches' in the last few years, and I'm pretty pleased with this one. (The other 2 were a ~2018 VeryFitPro, and the TicWatch GTH, which I ditched after a few days, when I purchased this.)First: the battery life is amazing; better than the VeryFitPro and WAY better than the TicWatch. I have been using this watch for 31 days now, and I only charged it after unboxing... It's still holding 18%, so I could let it go another week or so.It's worth noting that, along with having notifications and device control options disabled, I also turned off 'lift-to-wake' and automatic blood oxygen measurements (though the measurements I have taken were as-expected.) I imagine that while battery life would not be as stellar with nothing disabled, but it would still be great.Heart rate monitoring and step counts seem to be accurate and to track consistently. Data syncs are quick (and usually happen automatically.) The app does take a little 'sleuthing' to find different options, and some of the translations are confusing/inaccurate (such as the options for displaying distance being 'metric system' or 'British system,' which should say 'imperial system.') there is also a bug that will prompt you to visit the Play store to download an update when none is available. Despite these, however, the app is still decent compared with the apps for the other two watches I mentioned... ALSO, the watch face library is immersive (even in comparison with the Apple Watch!)I will say that sleep tracking leaves something to be desired, BUT I keep irregular hours (almost never sleeping at night,) and like most similar smartwatches it seems, this only tracks sleep at night-- and assumes one is sleeping, or trying to, when you're not even supine. I very much wish that these companies would let the user set a custom schedule, or even just have the option to turn sleep tracking on manually. Because it's such a commonplace problem, I don't fault Cloudpoem... But it does make it impossible for me to say that sleep tracking is accurate.I also really appreciate Cloudpoem making the band so easy to replace; you can use any standard 20mm watch band.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really good fitness tracker an watch and is an upgrade from my previous one. I have had a lower priced FitBit and another fitness tracker before this one I prefer this one. My previous tracker did not allow for true customized screen although they had options. This one has way more screen customization and I can change it to use one of my own pictures too. The band is comfortable and the screen size is appreciated too without being too big. The battery life is great. It has lasted 6 days of use with tracking mode activated twice each day and the next week the battery lasted 7 days. I actually forgot to charge that second week and when I realized I didn't it still had 9% left. That kind of battery life was one thing I was hoping for. I did not want a watch I had to charge daily. The tracking of exercises is good as well. It has many different kind of fitness tracking movements you can chose including walking, badminton and gymnastics as well as many others. I forgot to take it off and it got soaked and it was all good, thankfully it is water proof. It also has an SP02 sensor as well. One thing that it does not have is Google Fit integration but I don't miss that. I can still add the actions manually to Fit later. The watch will hold up to 7 days worth of data so you have time to pass that information on and even longer if you look for that info in the app. The app that is used is the Smart Band 3 app, you can pull that from appropriate app store. It is pretty simple to use and allows the customization of the watch/tracker. I have it setup to let me know when I need to move and I was able to adjust that time period, something I could not do with either or my previous trackers. There are no in box instructions on the use of the app but it is not that difficult to navigate it.I have had this purchase for almost a month now and have no no real complaints with it. All in all, I would recommend it and would buy it again if I lost it or it got damaged in some way.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second time buying a watch from this company. This one is a little different from the first. Overall it is a very nice watch. Looks good and does not feel cheap. It does not have a ton of features, but has all the basic fitness features. Everything I need for sure. Battery life is good. It was not even fully charged when I put it on and I have worn it for 4 days straight and have not had to charge it yet. I am not sure about the accuracy. The calorie count it shows seems very low. At 7:30 pm with almost 10,000 steps it shows 278 calories. My one complaint/suggestion for improvement is that I feel like there are very few instructions on how to actually use the features - almost none. The little booklet that comes with it shows what features there are and a picture of what they look like on the phone, but there is not really any instruction on how to operate them. It tells you how to download the app and pair or \"bind\" it to your watch and how to charge it, but that is about it. The watch is supposed to display text messages and give call alerts, but so far it hasn't for me, even though I have the SMS reminder turned on. I think there is a photo feature of some sort too, but I have no clue how to work that. I am not super techy and might just be doing something wrong, but without some better instructions I don't know what that is. The lack of instructions is why I only give it four stars. Otherwise I would not hesitate to give it 5 stars. At least at this point.",

It fits really well and looks so stylish.We are surprised at how long it holds its battery for. My husband uses his watch every day and the battery just seems to go on forever!It was incredibly easy to set up and sync to his phone. I it gives a detailed breakdown of his sleep patterns. He suffers with poor sleep so this has been useful in helping him understand his sleep patterns. It also allows him to monitor his blood pressure and his oxygen levels, which is brilliant and you can monitor the amount of steps you do daily.The watch face is very stylish and easy to navigate. You can use it to make calls and read your messages.Overall he is really impressed with this watch - it does everything it says and more, is sleek, stylish and an excellent price point.

                "reviewText": "La montre \u00e0 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de fonctions.Elle est top pour diff\u00e9rents types de sports (marche, course, rando montagne, \u00e9quitation etc...)Mais aussi pour le sommeil (phases de sommeil : profond, l\u00e9ger...) elle vous indique la qualit\u00e9 ou non de celui ci. Elle donne \u00e9galement des conseils pour avoir un meilleur sommeil si celui-ci n'est pas bon ou optimal.Il y a diff\u00e9rents cadrans \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger gratuitement m\u00eame si le choix et selon moi un petit peu restreint (je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 le cadran qui me tape dans l'\u0153il)Il y a aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de le personnaliser avec une photo perso, ce qui est vraiment chouette.Niveau batterie, je l'ai charg\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement il y a 8 jours et il reste encore 45% aujourd'hui.Elle se recharge facilement avec un embout magn\u00e9tique fournis.Elle est \u00e9tanche en ce qui concerne la douche et le lavage de main. Je n'ai cependant pas test\u00e9 en immersion compl\u00e8te. Mais d'autres avis r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 cette question.L'application est facilement t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeable m\u00eame sans le qr code.Elle est tr\u00e8s simple d'utilisation.Vous pouvez connect\u00e9 tous vos moyens de communication et ainsi voir vos messages SMS, whatsapp, messenger etc... La montre vibre et le d\u00e9but du message s'affiche.Pour les appels, la montre vous indique que vous en recevez mais vous ne pouvez pas d\u00e9crocher, juste raccrocher.La montre \u00e0 une fonction de recherche de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Tr\u00e8s pratique si, comme moi, vous ne savez jamais o\u00f9 vous laisser votre portable. Vous enclenchez la recherche et votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone se met \u00e0 sonner avec la sonnerie d'un appel ou vibre s'il est en vibreur.Je suis s\u00fbre que j'oublie quelque chose mais elle est tellement polyvalente que c'est difficile de tout \u00e9num\u00e9rer.Je suis vraiment ravie de mon achat qui pour un prix aussi d\u00e9risoire et vraiment parfait !Je recommande +++",

El reloj es muy bonito, la correa de goma es perfecta porque tiene suficientes agujeros para ajustarla a m\u00ed diminuta mu\u00f1eca que siempre me da problemas, la pantalla genial, trae varios modelos, pero adem\u00e1s la puedes personalizar con la fotograf\u00eda que t\u00fa quieras, la bater\u00eda a m\u00ed me dura much\u00edsimo, lo llevo 3 d\u00edas y a\u00fan no est\u00e1 por la mitad, la pantalla t\u00e1ctil va muy bien y es sencilla, el temporizador es muy pr\u00e1ctico, para hacer deporte tambi\u00e9n va genial, y las llamadas y mensajes tambi\u00e9n salen en la pantalla, adem\u00e1s te informa de qui\u00e9n los env\u00eda, cosa que en otros relojes no. Yo estoy encantada, lo aconsejo. El color rosa palo con dorado rosa tambi\u00e9n es muy bonito, y el cargador es con im\u00e1n, acopla muy f\u00e1cil.",
