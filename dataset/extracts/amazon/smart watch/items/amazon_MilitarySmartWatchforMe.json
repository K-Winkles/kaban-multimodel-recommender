                "reviewText": "I was looking for a watch to help track my fitness specifically walking more than anything. I looked at several watches but settled on this one based off my needs and price. Best decision I made. Now blood pressure and O2 are what they are for a watch but I was worried the pedometer would be one that just adds 3 steps every 10 seconds but it\u2019s actually very accurate. I was able to use photo for watch face and it\u2019s got really good resolution. Easy to see. Watch is made very well and does not feel cheaply made at all. 1 thing I really like is you can set whether you want phone audio through watch or just alerts. It uses Bluetooth and watch will ring when phone does or it will just vibrate. But it allows you to decide whether you want alert audio, music/phone calls through watch. It\u2019s very customizable. I haven\u2019t tested waterproofness (if that a word) but also don\u2019t really plan to. Only trouble I had is my wrist were a little bigger and the metal band didn\u2019t fit but the silicone band it comes with worked fine. I was however hoping for the metal band and the watch came with a card with contact info should I need any help with the product. I reached out to the customer service and asked if they sold any larger metal bands that I could get to wear. They promised a response within 24 hour on the card and all my responses from them were writhing 8 (unless it was their days off) they are getting me set up with more pieces for my band to be extended (also it comes with tool to make that easy which was an added bonus). Amazing customer service and watch was everything I needed and wanted it to be. Not disappointed in my purchase in the least.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this watch as a gift for my sibling. He loves it! He had an older android phone which it paired with. The problem was he only received messages from an ios. To send messages from an android you had to ahut the data off. He has since uogrded to a new android phone. I'm happy to report he receives all messages without anyone having to do any weird stuff.Durability- At his work he is constantly moving and hitting stuff. The watch is a champ, it takes a licken and keeps on ticket, to say the least. If this is the type of work you do. If your looking for a reasonable priced watch that not only is stylish (which in a construction type of environment or any work environment that you move or may hit your hands wrist etc.) isn't really a must, it isn't poorly made it has some weight to it (I hope that makes sense), is compatible with android and iPhone, and can even be worn out on date night or just an everyday watch. THIS IS FOR YOU! I can reassure you this is a great gift for anyone who doesn't want to pay the outrageous price for a galaxy or apple watch. That man who needs to wear a watch, likes metal watches vs the rubber bands this is the perfect option for him. It's also great for the ladies who like big faced watches. Women who of bigger stature a need bigger watches because \"ladies\" watches look like they're wear a watch the size of dime on their wrists this is for you. I have no doubt you'll be delighted with your purchase. Hopes this helps.",

                "reviewText": "I've worn a watch for many years, and it was time for me to get a new one. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a watch, but I wanted to try out a smart watch. I figured it could keep time since it would be synced to my phone and that was really all I wanted. My old watch never had to be charged, but it's not a big deal, I get about three days on a charge. I wear gloves at work with cuffs that come up over the watch, it's a problem because it rubs on the watch face and randomly changes the settings. It stopped waking up when I would look at it and I thought it had broken. It had randomly set a timer for it not to come on. That gave me the idea to use the timer when I am at work to prevent all the settings from getting jumbled up, I just have to push the button to see the time, problem solved. Over all, it does everything the description says. I love being able to see when I get a text because my wife and I text back and forth all day from work and before, I may go a couple hours before checking my texts. Now I just look at my watch when it buzzes. I chose this one because it had the metal band, I don't care for the straps. I have showered with It on with no problem. I have an android phone and have had no problem with connectivity. The app works good, not real complicated. I didn't get it for the fitness tracker but it seems to be working, most dial faces show the steps, heart rate and calories burned. One thing it really doesn't work very well at is showing an accurate temperature, not really something I need from my watch so for me it's not a problem. I know it shows that you can run over it, and use it to break walnuts, and stab it with a screw driver, but I still bought a screen protector for it, I know how my old watch looks. For the money I don't think you can go wrong, I would recommend it to people wanting a budget smart watch.",

                "reviewText": "First off, this watch has build quality, looks and functionality all rolled into one and I love it!The watch comes in a presentable box that is ideal for gift giving.The manual is not the best but it certainly provides what you need to understand the watch and be up and running.The watch comes with the typical proprietary, magnetic, multi pin USB cable, which I am not a huge fan of because I have had one go missing on my for another watch and they simply seem to be impossible to replace. That having been said, ALL the watches like this comes with proprietary cables, even though many of them look like they should be interchangeable.Setup was a little more involved than I have found to be, typical. Because of the many features, this watch (like all the others) requires an app and the has two seperate device connections for screen/data transfer as well as one for the audio feature on the watch which is a pretty functional speaker. The sound actually surprises me.Among the various features of this watch, there is also a level of aesthetic customization available through the app that allows for a few 7 different \"watch face\" backgrounds. This is becoming more common and is awesome because it is really like having a few different looking watches in your drawer to chose from.The watch features physical buttons as well. They allow for \"waking up\" the watch when it is not actively displaying anything as well as various mode selections and metrics selections for reading the data that thr watch is recording for you. Ie: steps, calories burned etc...The heart rate monitor seems quite accurate when it was compared simultaneously with an actual heart rate monitor that we have in the house. We are impressed by that.Aside from the built in exercise modes, this smart watch also provides you with the ability to make and answer calls, as music, select tracks, read emails and texts etc... All from your wrist.I have tested a number of these watches and this one, is by far, my favorite. It looks the part, is well made and is super functional. It is easily my best experience to date. At $50, I also believe it to be the best value out there at this time, as well.Definitely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Good quality screen with 360x360 resolution and bright with good contrast. Recording of many exercises and biological functions. Fast menus and many watch faces (with APP installation). Comes with two straps.Cons: App doesn't work on all devices. IP67 waterproof but not able to swim. Heavy and bulkier then more costly models. Does not have automatic brightness setting.The SUNKTA smart watch for men looks good, fits well and has a 1.32 inch screen with a resolution of 360x360. The screen looks good and you can select brightness and contrast settings. The watch has a 128MB Rom and 128K SRAM, 260mAh battery, Bluetooth 5 and is controlled manually with a button on the side.The watch has many different functions that include call control, voice assistant, set password, sleep monitor, heart rate monitor, SMS and social media alerts and tracks out your workouts and what type of activity. There is also blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, sleep and other biometrics that can be tracked.The watch is built with good quality has an IP67 and is made from metal and plastic on the outside. The watch comes with two straps and tools to remove the pins and replace them when changing straps. The package includes a USB cord charger, soft wiping cloth, instructions and warranty card. When first using the watch and app together you will need to find the watch which is easiest by looking at the Mac address found in the watch settings which will match the FitcloudPro app list of devices to pair (my house is full of Bluetooth capable devices so the Mac address helped with the unnamed ones).Using the watch on its own is possible however you need the FitcloudPro app to really get the most use out of the device. This watch does not have GPS so will rely on the phone for location. You will likely have to give a few permissions to make sure the watch is able to connect to the phone services properly.The watch is definitely a great upgrade over this price point a few years ago. The display is good quality and clear even in bright daylight (ensure you turn brightness up). There is a good amount of installed apps to record all things related to activity and health and can be tracked well with the companion app. In reality the watch lasts about 2-3 days per charge depending on how active and which settings you have set. The brightness and screen on time being the largest drain on battery power.The watch has a two year warranty and is definitely a good value for what you receive.",

                "reviewTitle": "Really beautiful but basic bluetooth watch, with good battery life",
                "reviewText": "Overall I like this smart watch, but like a lot of these non-Android/Apple/Fitbit watches, they're really just bluetooth devices for your smart phone with some typical fitness features. The heart rate and pedometer hardware, and the ability to see messages and make calls is really the primary feature of these devices. If they can do this with good battery life and avoiding the pain of constant pairings then its done its job.I really like the clear, bright screen. The display resolution is excellent. However there is no (from what I can tell) light sensor, and so the brightness is entirely dependent on you setting it. I tell you, if you go to a movie theatre with this watch and check the time regularly or simply stretch your head so the face turns on, people will ask you to turn it off. It's bright and won't auto dim.The casing is handsome but I find fake styling to be a waste. There is no compass, so including the NESW detail around the face is silly. It looks nice in a picture but if you think for 1 second about it, you'll realize it's a fake marketing bit.The crown and buttons have limited purpose. Clicking either of the buttons will bring up the apps, you can use the crown dial to scroll or just swipe on the screen, but either way, you have to touch the app/list item to select it. Which buttons get used when an app is running is up to you to figure out. The workout timers work well enough (they're timers that track heart rate and steps) but you'll just click anything expect to pause, cancel or get back to the main screen. It's basic but that's fine for a <$100 Bluetooth watch.The SmartLife app is basic and honestly I don't want to create another account with a password I need to worry about from a small company for a basic feature watch. There's a guest option when using the app. The match time is sync'd via the app, and I won't be surprised if the watch has clock drift and you'll need to sync it regularly to fix the clock if you're using it primarily has a workout BPM/step tracker.Lastly we come to the battery. I'm surprised none of the reviewers here mentioned a word about it, or how to charge it. The charging cable is proprietary, which is a disappointment actually. If it can't do wireless charging, then USB-C would be fine, even if it means worrying about its IP67 rating. The charging connector doesn't attach firmly to the back. It's magnetic but barely and the wrist band will easily push it off the back face mounting area. Charging isn't all that fast and if you thought it was doing so over night but the connector wasn't secured, you'd find a low battery in the morning. Other bluetooth watches I've seen have a kind of plastic clip to secure the contact. Maybe that's the answer as these magnets aren't reliable and if you lose the cable, that's it.As for battery life, I've used the watch infrequently over the last week. I fully charged it last Sunday and I write this review 7 days later. Since I work from home mostly, at a keyboard, I don't need or want a watch on my wrist while working. I used it during 3 workouts, an evening skiing, and 2 snow clearing sessions. I made a total of 4 calls and accepted 1. During skiing I received 3 messages (I typically have work focus on during the day, so no message alerts until evening). I did not charge the watch during this time, and I just left it on my desk when not using it. Battery drain when just sitting there, bluetooth not connected, screen off, is really great. Like the % barely moves. When I sat down to write this review, the battery indicator said 68%! I'm convinced I accidentally charged it at some point this week but I don't think I did. Impressive.",

Plus besoin de tra\u00eener mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec moi quand je m'entra\u00eene.De plus, cette montre offre de multiples options telles que le moniteur de fitness, le rappel s\u00e9dentaire, le chronom\u00e8tre, le suivi du sommeil, le moniteur d'oxyg\u00e8ne dans le sang, le contr\u00f4le de la musique, la cam\u00e9ra \u00e0 distance, les pr\u00e9visions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques, etc.La montre est tr\u00e8s belle, pr\u00e9cise, se charge rapidement et garde sa charge pendant des jours.Sa configuration est tr\u00e8s simple, install\u00e9e son application sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, se connecter sur son application sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, se connecter sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 partir de l'application et non par le Bluetooth du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone (tr\u00e8s important), et le reste de la configuration se fait \u00e0 partir de l'application.Elle vibre et affiche des messages pour Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, vibre quand il y a des appels qui entre, mais il faut au pr\u00e9alable donner les acc\u00e8s \u00e0 partir de l'application (tr\u00e8s importante).Je suis tr\u00e8s fier est tr\u00e8s flatt\u00e9 par cette belle montr\u00e9e.Mais pour ce qu'elle co\u00fbte, impossible de se tromper.
