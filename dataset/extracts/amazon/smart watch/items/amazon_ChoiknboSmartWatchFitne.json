Worst thing is that the recharge posts on the back of the watch give me a rash : ( which is odd because I have a dozen other watches with all metal backs that don't bother me . It does not bother the wife's skin though so maybe just me ?",

I am very happy with this product which is easy to use and sync with my phone. The watch is light and comfortable to wear. The screen is bright and touch-sensitive. The battery lasts several days without any problem. The health, sleep, heart rate and step tracking functions are accurate and motivating. The notifications are readable and convenient. I can also control the music and camera of my phone from the watch. I think this smart watch has a great value for money and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I've had an Apple Watch in the past but only really used a handful of features. If you want a watch that has specific app compatibility, this may not be it. But for what it DOES do, it does very well. I love the watch face/background gallery. The standard band is comfortable to wear and has more space than standard Apple Watch bands. Battery life is out of this world. With an Apple Watch, I had to charge it daily and could never use the sleep tracking functions because it had to sit on the charger all night. In comparison, this watch only uses about 10% per day. I popped it on the charger after about 5 days and it was fully charged again in under an hour. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for an intro smart watch or want a watch but know you won't use enough features to justify a $350 Apple Watch.",

                "reviewText": "(Now let me preface this review with item arrived as described etc.) However, I ordered this little guy for my kid for his birthday. Big disappointment. The watch is app driven. Works off bluetooth connection. Which I am sure that if we were to ever get the watch to connect to the app may have been the ideal choice. Alas, we could not ... we could not on several versions of devices. Although the APP is readily available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store. Regardless, the app could never find the watch. (SIDE NOTE: there is not a lot of features directly built into the watch) We tried scanning the QR code. App picked up the code but refused to connect ... again on several versions of phones and devices. My first thought was well at that price point could I really expect more? So I thought well if we can at least get the correct time set on the watch it may be fine. Well guess what? There is no way to set the time on the watch ... AT LEAST THAT I COULD FIND ... I have to allow for operator error here. The documentation that came with the unit was sparse. Troubleshooting page was not much help. Since it was a birthday gift I felt bad and ordered another brand. On the upside once the battery is charged it goes like gangbusters. So there is that.",
