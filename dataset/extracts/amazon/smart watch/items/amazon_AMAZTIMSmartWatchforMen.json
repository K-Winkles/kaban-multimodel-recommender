                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This watch looks excellent on my wrist!",
                "reviewText": "I like this smart watch because it is easy to use, has a long battery life, has heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen tracking sensors, it is waterproof and can withstand water up to 50 meters, it has a microphone and a speaker, and it has an artificial intelligent voice assistant, that I have been using to ask questions, set alarms, answer and make calls straight from my watch.Additionally, this smart watch has a 1.43-inch ultra-HD AMOLED screen which I believe may be the reason why the screen is so smooth, clear, and easy to use. It came with some resizing tools that I have used to make the length of the watch straps shorter on both sides. I started by removing a little bit but, I noticed that it was still big on my wrist so I removed a little bit more.After I shortened the straps, the watch became more comfortable on my wrist, and you can see from my pictures that my watch was looking quite loose on my wrist before I resized it, and once I resized it looked just fine.Even though this watch came with a user manual, I could pretty much figure out how to use the watch and its features simply by using it, since the watch has only two orange buttons on the side.I use the orange button on the top as the power button, so I can turn my smart watch on, I can lock the screen, I can use it to set a timer, to pause, to set alarms, and do many other things.While the other orange button on my watch is the sports button because it also works as a fitness tracker, and has 70 sport modes with smart recognition but, I had to install an app called \u201cKOSPET FIT\u201d in my iPhone to be able to use all these features, and by the way it is compatible with both android and iOS.After I installed the Kospet app, I paired this watch to my iPhone using the app, and it immediately displayed a message notifying me about a new firmware version and asking if I would like to update it and I thought that would be better for me to keep all my apps updated just for safety, so I did.Then, I programmed my smart watch to be randomly checking my heart rate from time to time throughout the day, and I set a reminder on my watch so it will vibrate in case my maximum heartbeat becomes greater than 180BPM while I am awake, moving around and staying active, and my watch will also vibrate if it gets lower than 50BPM while I am resting, but I can increase or decrease the number of heart beats per minute anytime.Since I have enabled Bluetooth calling on my smart watch, I have been able to make calls and receive calls straight from my watch what I found very cool, but I can always disable this feature by clicking on the small phone image that appears on the watch screen.At first, I have programmed my smart watch to play music by going to the settings then pressing the sound and vibration option and turning on the media audio on my watch.However, while I was listening to some of my favorite songs right from my watch, I noticed that some people near me were a little bit bothered by the music because they literally mentioned that I was too showy, that the music was very distracting so, I did not take it personal at all.In fact, I understand that not everyone has the same musical tastes that I do, and even if some people may like my music, they just happen to have a hard time staying focused on their tasks with music or any type of noise around so, I disable the music feature on my watch but I enable the music back when I am by myself anytime.Furthermore, this smart watch has seventy fitness modes such as archery, basketball, baseball, boating, boxing, cricket, golf, horse riding, hockey, swimming, volleyball, skating, spinning, skiing, shooting, softball, yoga, sit-ups, wrestling, taekwondo, tennis, treadmill, rugby, and many others.I appreciate the artificial intelligent voice assistant because I can ask questions, I can check the weather, I can set alarms in the morning to wake me up at a specific time during the week and at a completely different time on the weekends, and when I am cooking or baking, I can leave something in the oven or on the stove and set a timer, and I can also make calls using the voice assistant.In addition, this watch has smart recognition for six different sports and because I have been exploring and trying my best to use all the features that my watch has, I went to the settings, then I clicked on sport recognition to enable my watch to identify when I am walking, or running, or in a stationary state, or using the elliptical, the rower, or cycling so my watch senses these 6 specific sport modes without I have to set manually one of these modes.The only thing I dislike on this watch it is the weight, that I found a little bit heavy for me but, it may be because this watch was specifically designed for men to wear, since this watch has all sorts of certifications and it is extremely resistant to damage, corrosion, and can withstand harsh conditions, bad weather, and even be submerged to water up to 50 meters.Therefore, I do not regret getting this watch for myself, because it has 9H dual glass cover, and a 1.43-inch ultra LD AMOLED screen, which gives my watch a sharp and clear display, the body of the watch is composed of all metal, and besides the metal straps it also came with two silicone straps, so if I ever get tired of the way that my watch looks I can simply change the straps to give my watch a different appearance, and I have been using the artificial intelligent voice assistant, as well as the health and fitness tracking modes, and from personal experience this watch has a great battery life, and I am not trying to brag but, I think this watch looks excellent on my wrist.",

Also the size is really great and super impressive battery. The sports / biometric stats array of features is sizeable and impressive.I have the only few issues.1. Can't seem to change date format. Stuck on DD MM ( not my phone's setting either,)2. Media control only seems to work when used as speaker.3. Notifications for text are tricky (seems to have trouble with group text)4. Can only see text cannot do quick replies5. Doesn't show pictures or emoji.Despite the above I still rate high. It is great value for the price.Also these are all issues that could be addressed with software updates. As this is a fairly new product strongly urge manufacturer to take these notes seriously and patch.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a budget smart watch to replace my old and broken Samsung Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier. After using the watch for years, I realized the exact aspects I need in a I smart watch and what I don't, so the new Galaxy watch doesn't seem neccessary or a good value to me. Also, I was looking for a more durable build, a watch that I can do the gym, yard work, wash my hands in, use power tools with high vibration, go for days in the woods hiking and camping with a battery that would last... I didn't want to spend big money on a $1000 Garmin with the GPS and all that because I also want to be able to just throw away the watch if it breaks due to my abuse, and buy a new one, so less than $200 was my target. I went with the curved version of the Tank first. I fell in love with the bright, crisp amoled screen and the plethora of free watch faces instantly. Then the usefulness of all the stuff I had on my Samsung watch was stuffed in here at a much cheaper price point. But the shape didn't feel right to me, it felt like a large fit bit on my wrist and I like a watch. So I tried the TRex Pro by Amazfit. It was a little more money but had GPS built in. Down side was the watch was very plastic, very light and cheap feeling and the screen was too dim and not sharp enough for someone spoiled by Samsung. Then I found this watch, which is the Tank T2, and realized it's a Kospet same as the curved screen Tank I had originally bought. For the price point, I don't need GPS, but instead I get metal, solid feeling build quality, call connectivity with my phone, meets all my workout tracking needs, outdoor needs, battery life is way longer than Samsung, watch face choices are vast, the Kospet app is straight forward and easy to use. I spent $50 less on the Tank T2 than I did on the TRex Pro and in all ways other than the GPS, the Tank2 seems like the better watch...cool. I posted a couple pics to show you can customize the watch face from your gallery, but the camera on my ZFold 4 doesn't do the watch screen any justice, it's just as bright and sharp as my Samsung watch. It's only been a couple days so we'll see how it holds up under daily wear and tare. I installed the screen protector that came with the watch so I'm not worried about scratches to the face, and that metal frame will look tuff when it starts to get nicks and scratches. This is not my dress-up watch... At $100, I'm not gonna feel terrible if I destroy it working on a lawnmower or something. I'd recommend if you need a budget friendly watch with call, sms, etc. connectivity to your phone, water resistant microphone and speaker that is loud, (the TRex Pro doesn't have a mic or speaker, by the way, so no talking to your virtual assistant from your wrist and hearing responses) great fitness tracking, not overly blocky like a military style tactical watch but still very masculine and rugged looking, and feels more expensive than it is. I'm pleasantly surprised by the Tank T2 smart watch.***Quick update. I don't know if this is due to poor build quality or a more common chemical reaction, but after a couple nights out in the woods with bug spray all over me for the mosquitoes, the plastic on the back of the watch looks to be melted...? I've had the watch about 4 days. First outdoor trip with it. I'm guessing the melting is from a chemical reaction to the Deet in the insect repellent spray? Surely it couldn't be from poking the campfire and roasting marshmallows, since this mil spec watch has a higher temp tolerance than my hand... I've included some nee pics of the back of the watch. Any explanations are welcomed...Haven't changed my rating because I still like this watch.",
