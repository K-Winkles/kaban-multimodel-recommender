I also bought another watch, a different brand but another smart watch (uaue) and did the same as the other. The escorts services aren't the only charges resulting in multiple charges in different amounts causing me to close credit cards and go through the process of getting new cards and accounts. Totally not worth it. Sending both back and will purchase fitness watches elsewhere like a sporting goods store like Dickson, Academy or other",

This fitness/smart watch is surprisingly nice and works extremely well. First impressions, looks smart, nice clear glass screen with a single button on the side to depress when selecting from the touch screen. The strap is a lightweight silicone in pink but is detachable if you wish to replace. The only slight criticism at this point is the button on the side presses in and rotates but the rotation has no functionality. It would be great if you could scroll using the turning dial. Oh well, it is very cheap ,lol The overall set up was simple. Download the FitCloudPro app, follow the on screen or manual installation and within minutes it's all connected and you can receive emails, texts, weather information. You can monitor your heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen, sleep, and it is also able to count your steps and sports information. There are many screen items to select for you , and you can arrange the items you want to watch on your watch face. This smart watch supports multiple language , like English, French, Chinese, etc. You can also change the digital display to suit yourbown style. For the money I am genuinely very pleased and as its a gift I know my mother will be happy with it. I would recommend for anyone looking for a budget fitness / smart watch. Oh and the battery last for ever!",
