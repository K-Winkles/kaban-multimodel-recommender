Simple layout on app, but features do not work seamlessly as the app states. I got notifications at first, but as soon as I used dnd they stopped working. I have it set for water and move reminders, got 0. It has not monitored my sleep yet at all, and I can find no instructions to set it up at all. Instructions are just upselling the product. No actual instructions at all. I can't get it to monitor anything automatically, I actually have to tap the screen to get it to do it. Seems relatively accurate, it came on time, and is cute and stylish, good price, but does not work as \"advertised\", and instructions? Don't bother.just packing material. If I can't get it to work, I'm returning.",

                "reviewText": "Had to come back to edit this after a few days...The pink band and rose gold color is very pretty. Most of the apps are easily accessible. However, you cannot reply to messages. Unless someone has found a way please share with me. I've googled googled, can't find answers to help troubleshoot. The manual is a joke because its the size of the box it came it and probably less than 500 words. Not surprised considering it is an Amazon product. I figured it's worth is only if used for just tracking steps and heart rate. Just as any other Smartwatch don't even bother using the blood pressure feature, can't possibly be accurate. It's as stated by all the reports out there that in order to use the Smartwatch blood pressure feature, you should be calibrating with an actual arm cuff from time to time, otherwise as a standalone, it's just an estimate. If you know anything about how blood pressure is measured then you'd know it to be true that no watch can accurately measure your blood pressure without applying pressure. The reminder feature for drinking water only worked once then stopped working. I've reset, unpaired, and stilll doesn't fix that feature. The text message notifications ALSO stopped working after like the 1st day. So yeah...if you're just planning to use it for steps and HR then should be fine....for now.",

Easy to charge as well, and connects easily to my phone/bluetooth.",
