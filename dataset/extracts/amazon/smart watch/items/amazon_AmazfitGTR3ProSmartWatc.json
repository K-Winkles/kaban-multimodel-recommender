                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Full of features and an awesome battery",
                "reviewText": "I've had my GTR 3 Pro for about two weeks. This is my first ever smart watch or fitness tracker, I'm not an athlete, and so far I'm very happy with this watch. I can't imagine needing more workout options or settings or features... too many to list and review here. I use the Android Zepp app on my Samsung phone and there's a lot of information in the app and it's pretty intuitive to me; you use the phone app do most of the watch settings and see the super-detailed health and workout data, just make sure to keep the app running all the time. That means now your phone's bluetooth is always on, something new to me but I suppose not for a lot of people. If you're away from your phone, it all syncronizes the next time the watch and phone connect. The battery and price were my main reasons for choosing this watch (and it's round, like a watch should be). The battery is no joke: I think the manufacturer promises around 12 days, and after nine days it was at 14%. I logged a workout each day, made and answered a few phone calls, slept overnight with it on once, replied to texts, kept it connected to the phone, never turned it off, left most if not all of the default settings (screen NOT always on, heart rate every 10 minutes), and played with it a lot. No doubt results will vary. Just a couple hours to re-charge. I've read about high-brow ($$$) watches being charged once or even twice a day... that's a non-starter for me. I keep the big and responsive screen at about 15% brightness but it is on auto-brightness so you can see it out in the sun. GPS seems accurate after looking at the maps of my walks in the app... start an outside workout, tap start and give it 15 seconds or so to catch the GPS signal, the phone vibrates and you're off. Works everytime. I pretty much take the watch's word for it as far as heart rate, steps, calories and the rest of the fitness and health features. I have nothing to compare it to so works for me. The description says includes wifi but it isn't anything you can use like you might think or turn on or off as you please... might just be for transferring music to the watch. With just the companion Zepp app on your phone, you can make and answer phone calls with the watch's built-in microphone and speaker. And you can reply to text messages either with an emoji or from a selection of pre-set responses that you can edit or add to (you make/edit these using the Zepp app on your phone, they're syncronized to the watch, and the responses appear on your watch when you tap reply to a text). Works great. You can't create a text with the watch (maybe thru Alexa, not sure). There's a little app store in the Zepp phone app (maybe 20 apps), where you can download small apps to the watch (stocks, calculator, etc.). I am an Alexa newbie but it also works fine. Set-up is a bit clunky using the manual and Zepp app but after going through the process a couple times it works. We don't have anything else Alexa in the house so still figuring out what to do with her besides weather, lists, etc.I'm still using the supplied brown band... not sure if it's really leather but it is comfy and looks good. I was worried most about the large size of the watch with my skinny wrists, but it looks ok even with a separate cover that adds a couple mm to the overall size. I had a cover over the whole watch before I ever turned it on, so I can't comment on scratch resistance and such. I immediately cover all my devices and screens and there are several protection options on Amazon. By the way it can be worn on the right wrist, too, by swapping the band around and settings to flip the screen and buttons. Easy peezy. I've loaded over 200 MP3s to the watch and have over 1G memory left. It connects perfectly to my cheap bluetooth ear buds and so far stays connected. The watch comes with about five or six watch faces pre-installed, but through the Zepp app on your phone you can download more. A lot of them cost a couple bucks but I can't count the free ones. Loading a new face onto your watch takes a couple of taps and it's installed and active on your watch. I've downloaded one of the several separate phone apps just for Amazfit faces and it offers hundreds more for free and works great. I can't imagine anyone wanting more free watch faces, they just don't all come pre-installed on the watch. Nor should they, taking up memory space. Delete and download new faces as you feel the need for change.On the negative side I have yet to get the offline voice commands to do anything. These are built-in voice commands that let you speak to open apps and control some watch features. They are separate from talking to Alexa, which works fine for me. I haven't really sought a solution yet because it's just too easy to get to everything on the watch by swiping or rotating the crown button. The Zepp app does use a good chunk of phone memory... whenever I check it is using between 600 and 800MB of internal storage. Could be alot for some phones and I've no idea if the app can be moved to external phone storage. Hopefully it can. I recommend keeping an open mind when reading some of the negative reviews based on one or two features out of the 50 things the watch does (like 1-star reviews because the customer doesn't like having to use the rotating crown to navigate the display, or couldn't get an old watch's face on this new watch, or too hard to install watch faces (no... it's super easy), or one feature it doesn't even advertise it can do but it \"should\" do... I don't understand one-star reviews like that). Overall it's a great smart watch value with a long list of useful features.UPDATEAfter I had the watch for weeks I learned there are watchfaces with tap-able/shortcut spots on them, that'll take you directly to different apps in the watch... steps, weather, heart, alarms, etc.And, if you tap on the city name in the weather app you can select other cities that are in the weather section of the Zepp app on your phone. I did that accidentally one day. I had no idea.",

                "reviewText": "Tried out 4 different watches before settling on this one and glad it did! Spent too many hours researching and reading reviews lol. Have had this watch on my wrist now for just over a week and loving it. Checked all my boxes and more. Has a beautiful easy to read screen, even outdoors. Battery life is great. Started wearing it at 80% charge and a week later with a lot of use (including running with gps) it still has 32%. Way better than having to recharge an Apple Watch every day. Has a great amount of faces that look great and provide easy to read info. Paired super fast and easy with my iPhone. Found the Zepp app very friendly and easy to use and it provides more info than you will know what to do with! I love the PAI feature which is an automatic measure (physical activity indicator) of how much fitness you are getting in. I love that this basically sets a goal for you and is an easy way to keep track of how you are doing!. I upgraded the strap (not that there was anything with the plastic one) to a stainless one for 11.99 and it looks great and very expensive. Super light weight. Waterproof. Has built in GPS so no need to bring your phone on a run. Will notify you of text, calls etc which you can configure in the app. But you can't respond, at least not with an iPhone. Has built in Alexa. Have been using it at the gym with my personal trainer. I like that when you increase the intensity of your workout it automatically starts tracking your heart rate much more frequently than in every day usage. (this saves a lot on battery but gives it to you when you the heart rate most when you need it). Has an altimeter which seems accurate which I will put to good use when hiking in the Colorado Rockies where I live. A tons of other features, 7 day weather outlook, calendar, to do list, Heck the watch even tells you if this is a good day to get your car washed! lol. Anyways reviewing and purchasing a smart watch is a bit subjective of course. Sort of like trying to review coffee. A lot depends on your goals and personal preference. But for me this was a great option. Would be nice if it came with an owners manual (there is one available I found online) but I found it intuitive to use anyways after playing around with it for a while. One last thing is that the screen is slightly smaller than some of the other options out there (the GTR3 pro is a little larger) which suits me as well since I have somewhat smaller wrists. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this watch if these are the kind of features that you are looking for.",

                "reviewText": "After usage during a month:1. Battery life is very good, 10-11 days with everyday 1 hour workout, sometimes with GPS, without minimal \"always on\" display, \"wrist on\" for 10 secs is a reality, 3-4 days with AOD. GPS eats ~3%/hour. Local music takes about 15% per hour through speakers, a bit less through Bluetooth. That's more than enough.2. Overall look is nice. The display is perfect. There are thousands of faces available. Though neither one, probably, absolutely fits your needs, easy-to-use software exists to add small improvements.3. Base bridge application, Zepp, is acceptable.4. Amazfit OS itself is much weaker than Android or even Wear OS or Apple's one from flagman producers. You have practically no way to install applications. Proprietary application store contains nothing useful. However, based on powerful OSs watches work for just a day (and a half, maybe) and this negates almost all their advantages.5. Accuracy of heart rate measurements is very personal and depending on different conditions. I would say the same for other smartwatches. Accuracy of GPS location at outdoor runs is \u00b110m.6. If configurated properly, the watch gets notifications and allows answering phone calls when the phone is nearby.7. Water resistance is quite consistent with the description so far.8. There is blood pressure sensor, but it looks that BP measurements are available only in China so far.",
