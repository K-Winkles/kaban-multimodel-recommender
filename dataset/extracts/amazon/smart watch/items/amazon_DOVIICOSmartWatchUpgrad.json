                "reviewText": "I always have my AirPods in, and you HAVE to stay connected to it over Bluetooth for it to be able to work. But when you have it connected, it will randomly start playing whatever is supposed to be going through your AirPods, through your watch. So if your in class, someone can randomly connect to your watch and blast music and you have no control over it, or your music will disconnect from your AirPods to your watch and everyone can hear everything. I was also getting it to mimic an Apple Watch since mine broke and didn\u2019t feel like paying a lot of money, and this is HUGE. The square is way too big, you can just tell that it\u2019s off brand and terrible. The time will also keep switching from 11:30 to 16:30. You can also only have army time, not standard which was difficult for me. Overall, not impressed. Will be returning. It did turn on, but worked terrible. Don\u2019t buy.",
