The strap is really comfortable and doesn't cause irritation which she is very prone to so I am relieved .The battery is insanely good and the item looks really cool. If it wasn't pink I'd probably kept it myself :-). The health monitoring is perfect and there are plenty of nice features. Very easy to use too. you can connect it all to the app if that's what you want to do and it isn't complicated. It will be hard to find better value anywhere. Thank you",
