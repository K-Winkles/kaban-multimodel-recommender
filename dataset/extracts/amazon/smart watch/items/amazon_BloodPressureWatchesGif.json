Blood pressure reading is only a couple points off from what my arm cuff reads. It is easier to see incoming texts than my phone is because I can see them without having to take my gloves off. The charge so far lasts 4 days before needing re-charged. The phone speaker works great too. I would buy this again, but hopefully won't have to for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "All things considered, I really love this watch and I wear it almost every day. I love the tactical look of it and it pairs well with my work uniform. The strap is adjustable and comfortable. The instructions were easy to use and the app was simple to download and understand.My favorite features include the smoothness of the user interface, the user-friendliness, its ability to check your heart rate and how many steps you've walked, and to track your sleeping patters. That being said, I have run into a few issues.Firstly, the strap gets really sweaty on my wrist. I suspect it's because of the material it's created from, which feels similar to rubber. Maybe I am sensitive to the material and that is what is causing my wrist to get so sweaty after wearing it for the day but it's definitely a bit frustrating. The strap is detachable though,. so if I want to replace it with a different strap I should be able to.Secondly, the functionality of the messaging system is lacking. I am only able to view a text message and delete it. I cannot respond to a text from the watch. I have not tried out the call feature.Thirdly, you cannot disconnect the watch from your bluetooth if you want it to continue taking your vitals and steps, but you HAVE to disconnect it from the bluetooth if you don't want everything you play on your phone to be routed to the watch instead. This is the biggest downfall to me about this watch. If I forget to disconnect my watch from my phone and I'm watching youtube or started a phone call, the sound will go through the watch instead of my phone, even without the dial feature set up.For this I'm giving it four stars. I love the watch otherwise, and these things may not bother other people but they bother me.",

                "reviewText": "I picked this because it has blood pressure sensor in it. My very expensive fitness watch doesn't have that and I'm getting ready for a long trip coming up next year and I'd really like to have a blood pressure monitor with me. (I'm weird about my numbers.)I decided to give this a try to see how it would do.I got to say, I'm blown away with what all they packed into this watch at a very modest price. Getting it synced with my Apple phone was very straight forward. The screen is very clear and bright. However, it is worth noting the screen goes black after so many seconds and you have to wake it up when you want to see it. (Not really a big deal, but if this is a deal breaker for you, now you know.)The touch screen on this is very responsive. Beside just flipping through the screens there's an on screen calculator and you can even dial numbers right from from the watch face. When you dial a number you can even talk into the watch and hear the other person right on your wrist. While not super loud I was able to clearly hear my wife on a test call. She said my voice sounded loud and clear to her.I have no doubt this is waterproof as promised. I wore it over the course of several days and never took it off even when in the shower. However, the shower did mess with the touch screen.I took this for a run on my treadmill and after about an hour of jogging it was off by about a 10th of a mile. It read 5.76 miles when I'd actually only gone about 5.66 miles. I'd say that is reasonably accurate.Blood pressure monitor was consistently low by about 4 to 5. The watch would read me about 104/66 when my blood pressure was actually closer to 108/70. I can live with that though as long as I know it is consistent. Which it is.Battery life was easily over a week.This is probably not geared towards fitness as much as I'd actually use on regular basis. For example when I went for a run it didn't tell me my pace. Just how long and far I'd run. I know with that I can figure out my pace, but it is a small ask to want the watch to just have this built in. I suppose to be fair to this point I'm a runner and triathlete. So, I'm probably not the target audience for this watch. I would guess this is for the average Joe, or Jane, that is looking for an inexpensive smart watch that can also help them keep track of their health.All and all, I think this is an awesome value! It won't replace my fitness watch, but I'll definitely be taking this along next year for the blood pressure monitor feature.Happy to give this one 5 out of 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I understand the disclaimers and I am not expecting this to be a medical grade product. With that being said, the functions on this watch are great! There are a few quirks on the app. Had a bit of trouble getting it to accept the birthdate and weight. But I got it working. I wish that you could pair it on two devices simultaneously. That would be an excellent help in our situation. My husband enjoys keeping an eye on his status. While I need to be able to keep an eye on his blood pressure. When the watch is paired with my phone, I can quickly check his BP while he is anywhere in the house. Without going into details, suffice it to say that this is huge, even if it was not an exact reading. The other functions are helpful as well. Of course the stips, and heart rate. But there are some wellness things included that are fun from time to time. The display on the app is very easy to read. This watch is a great value. It looks nice on his arm, and the band will fit most. It is a soft silicone and comfortable to wear. There are clock face choices and we found several that he likes.",
