Pros: Battery lasts an average of 2 1/2 days.Screen is great, it's exactly what is advertised (1.5 in.) and crystal clear. 22mm band is a soft elastic rubber material that is comfortable.Easy to work with integrated apps.Phone call capableStreaming music from phone capable.Cons:Bluetooth overrides phone and plays through watch unless you switch Bluetooth off to phone.Limited watch faces. There is a gallery on \"Da fit\" app, but it's minimal. Only good thing is the fact that you can add your own background photo.Must have \"Da fit\" app to use watch features and to connect to phone.All in all, this is a great watch for the price. Noone would ever know you paid 1/10 the price of the flagship devices.",
