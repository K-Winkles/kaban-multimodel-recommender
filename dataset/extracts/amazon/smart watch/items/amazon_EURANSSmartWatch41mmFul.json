I also really like that it shows me when I woke up or got up in the night. Pretty sure it really is waterproof as I have accidently gotten into the shower with it on twice, took it off quickly but it was very wet. So far its fine. For $20, everyone should have one!",

We all three like them though. Are they super accurate? No, but they're also pretty inexpensive, so they're good enough for our use. I immediately had my husband replace my band. Just look for a 20mm watch band. Any will fit. It took my husband 2 minutes to pop it off and replace it. I have had ot for about a week and a tiny line has appeared on my screen, so I'm ordering a replacement, but honestly, it's barely noticeable, I am just still in the return window, so I figured I may as well. Highly recommend for the price. Oh, and DON'T enable the weather. It has a bug that they are apparently aware of, but it causes the app to continuously crash until you can catch the toggle on the phone screen and turn it off. It would be great to have, but not a deal breaker for us.",

It does have other features such as sleep monitoring however that is not the primary purpose so those punctions are just basic.The watch is nice and has all the features necessary to keep track of heartbeat, O2, calorie intake and burn, type of exercize, etc. My hisband has always claimed that he does not need or like any type of \"smart\" anything, however, he sure attaches to them easily! He didn't have this watch for 2 weeks before he was asking me how to make a phone call on it - which, of course, it does not do, IT DOES NOT do this. He said he wanted a sports watch, not a smrt phone. But after using this watch for aboout a month, we gave in and he purchaseda smart watch, complete with the ability to check his emails, messages, and make and recieve phone calls.My 15 year old son loves this watch now. He is a football player and truly is only interested in the fitness aspect of the the features available. It is perfect for him! For the price, it is a good deal, I was certain my husband could not have purchased a smart watch for such a low price, and this makes much more sense - and it is still a really good deal!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this on sale for a tenth of what I spent on my last Fitbit. I read many reviews and knew it was basic. First of all, the battery does keep its charge very well since it has way less functionality than a smarter watch. I went ten days on the initial charge, and today I am ten days out again, and will need to charge it tonight. I have not had problems with the charger like some. The heart rate data read my resting heart rate very low, but when I check the rate through out the day, it seems fairly accurate. The step counter may be a little low, but not too far off. The ap is fairly user friendly, and when downloaded from Google Play, I did not have to put in any payment information as some have mentioned. That being said, I never received the email to activate my fitdock account. You have to sync with the ap periodically throughout the day and keep your phone close if you want real time call and message notification. All of these things are expected and forgivable in a watch that cost less than $20. What has me irked today is that the alarms are not going off at the time that I've set them for. For example, I have one set to remind me to clock in at work when I'm miraculously running early. Today it went off 3 minutes late. An alarm I have set to go off every evening did not go off until forty minutes later last night. That I cannot forgive. I never use the music controls or the blood oxygen monitor, so I can't speak to that. I have splashed it while hand washing, and had no trouble, but I never wear it in the shower, or say, washing dishes. I don't know that I would trust it to be waterproof while swimming. Also, there is not option to track swimming anyway, so why would you? I miss the auto tracking of exercise I got with Fitbit, you have to start and stop with the watch, and there are limited options. I miss the elliptical option. I miss the ability to track my water consumption from my watch. It will do for now, but in the future I will see if there is a bit more functional option for less than the Fitbit price. Definitely not for anyone seriously tracking their data. More for casual users. Still, a watch pedometer combo for $15 isn't bad, but you have to have low expectations going in.",
