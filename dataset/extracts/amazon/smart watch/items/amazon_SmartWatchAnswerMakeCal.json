                "reviewText": "This is a nice replica of an Apple Watch 8. After that it\u2019s terrible. App is almost non usable due to it being in test mode which brings a constant string of advertisements which stops the use of the app. The watch buttons and screen do not respond as they should. The watch is slow to respond. At times the notifications work. Battery life is about 8 hours so it does not make it through one day and is dead before your work shift is complete. All around terrible item that isn\u2019t worth the box it\u2019s packaged in. The first watch I received was used which I seem to be receiving a lot of items from Amazon that have been previously used. Amazon needs to be more on top of there game in this area. It\u2019s okay if I know I am purchasing a previously used item for a discounted price but if not noted, I expect a new item.",
