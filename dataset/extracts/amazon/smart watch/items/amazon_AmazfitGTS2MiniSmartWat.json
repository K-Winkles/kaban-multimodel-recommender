                "reviewText": "After going through three Fitbits that have died on me after a year, I decided to try another brand of smart watch. While I would love an Apple Watch, the need to charge every day is not ideal. I don't want to have to add charging my watch each day to the many other things I have to remember to do. So, I decided to try this Amazfit GTS 2 Mini. It is among the thinnest and lightest of smart watches, and I didn't want anything bulky on my arm.I'm really happy with it so far! It has taken about four days to really play with it and understand all that it can do. For instance, today, i just discovered that I can create customized watch faces. I thought I was stuck with the pre-made ones in their watch store. This really makes me feel like I can make the watch very personalized to me.I really like the long battery life. I also like how immediately and quickly it syncs. It used to take my old fitbits FOREVER to sync. I love that I can customize the shortcuts to only see the features I want in the order I want. I love that I could customize the app to hide the features I won't use and put the features I will use in the order in which I want to see them. I really like the countdown app, the cycle tracker, the meditation breathing, the sleep tracking, the heart rate monitor, step tracker, the weather (although it could be more self-explanatory), the ability to control sound and move forward/backwards when playing music, podcasts, or other audio from my iphone.My favorite feature is that I can have a plain digital clock display with the date, day, and steps when the screen is off. That was the feature that sold me on the watch!The screen is also beautiful. The band is quite plain-looking relative to the beauty of the watch, but I'm just ordering a nicer band to put on it.I got all of these many new features in a device that still cost much less than what I was paying for those Fitbits!!I'm giving it four stars only because I had a few glitches that I hope won't become long-term issues. One issue was that some of the notifications weren't coming through. However, after restarting and changing a setting on my phone, it has been back to working fine. The other issue was that after a day or two the digital clock was not displaying when the screen was off. I'm not sure if that was a watch system issue or if I have a setting somewhere that was not configured properly.It does have Alexa (to provide text-based responses), but I disabled it. It only seemed to work when you have the Zepp app open on the phone. Doing that would get so cumbersome that it would defeat the purpose of having it readily available on the watch.Overall, I am very happy with this watch!UPDATE: I'm actually bumping to five stars. I am so much happier with this watch than my old Fitbits. The screen is gorgeous. I realized that I wasn't getting the digital screen-off clock because the watch turns it off when it thinks I'm sleeping. After I wake and get moving, it starts displaying again. Neat! The displays of notifications are still unclear to me, and it can't get the weather for the exact place where I live (only for the next county over). Still, I'm really happy with this watch given its price and the other options out there on the market. I notice that I'm using the meditation/breathing bubble app quite often!SECOND UPDATE: They need a better instruction manual for this watch. Just when I think I had discovered all that it can do, I come across other features that I didn't know about. I didn't realize that all of the watch faces can come with their own screen off watch faces. Also, the watch faces you customize have their own bare bones screen off watch face (so that you can get the color of text you want for the screen off face). Being able to customize the screen off watch face has been awesome! I also had not understood the \"lit when wrist lift\" setting. I now have that off, which is what I prefer. Realizing these functions saves battery life and helps me customize the watch even more to my style and liking. As for battery life, in the first week, I got a little over four days of battery life on a full charge. However, I was playing with it a lot and I had not realized how to use the \"lit when lift wrist\" function. Now that I turned off the \"lit when lift wrist function,\" I'm getting longer battery life. Even happier with my watch!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this watch for 2.5yrs now and it\u2019s still going strong!! Best I\u2019ve used and better than other fancy watches that are 10X+ more expensive! Battery lasts days and recharges fast! You can get alerts for calls and messages (I have it linked to direct calls and texts and WhatsApp), answer or reject calls using the phone, gives current weather when linked to your phone, tracks your cycles etc. Great and accurate at tracking heart rate, blood pressure, sleeping patterns and have good workout tracking options. And my favorite feature that really makes this watch shine is that it\u2019s waterproof! I wear it 24/7, in the shower/bath etc and wait for it for swimming on a regular basis. It tracks laps I swim and after 2.5 years it\u2019s not showing any issues with water getting in! How amazing is that! Not even Apple Watches do that, in fact my iPhone 12 died after a few months of purchase after wearing it around a water park with less than 5 mins of min shallow water submersion! Handles rough wear and tear well too! Looks great, fit and feel is great, works amazing, most durable tech gadget I\u2019ve ever owned, highly highly recommend!!! It really is the full package! Oh and affordable too!!!",

                "reviewText": "I own a Sansung smart watch but the battery life was very short. I got this Amazfit GTS2 Mini because of the great battery life. Both watches were to aid in counting steps and to use as a timer for daily physical therapy reps. Both watches do a void job at counting steps and tracking sleep.I like the weight and finish of the Amazfit. The battery life winds out hands down over the Samsung and is stellar. The short comings for me are that you can't customize your timer (countdown). I need 30 second timer for my pt exercises. There is no way to customize RECURRING timer. You have to manually scroll to 30 seconds each time. If you ask Alexa to set reoccurring timer you only get one and have to keep requesting. AMAZON PLEASE FIX THIS. Now that I have the watch I see that many people have the same issue.The mobile app is a little difficult to navigate but getting used to it.If a timer isn't an issue or answering phone calls, this is a great watch for the money.",
