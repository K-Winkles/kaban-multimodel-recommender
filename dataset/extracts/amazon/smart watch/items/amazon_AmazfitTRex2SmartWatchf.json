                "reviewText": "The battery, speed, features, durability, clarity, and accuracy are outstanding. You cannot beat the price and quality of this watch.The battery is as good as they say it is. If you use it constantly through the day for various things it will not last the full two weeks but it is still much better than any smart watch I\u2019ve owned. I\u2019m on day 3 now and at 74% battery using it a lot. I\u2019ve fiddled with it through the days using it as often as I can.The OS is smooth and runs very snappy. Running a timer and the stopwatch while using a compass? No problem! Some of the free watch faces have the ability to allow you to go directly to various apps on the device or tells you what is running or if Bluetooth is being actively used.Too many features to go through in a review here but it has plenty of information. There are some watch faces that provide you with tons of useful information. Metrics, date, weather, moon phases, barometric pressure, rain warning, sun rise/set, alarms, screen lock, humidity, etc.. it\u2019s a lot.It\u2019s durability seems to be really good. It is plastic so it\u2019s very light but still feels very solid. I haven\u2019t felt like it\u2019s going to break if I bang it on something (which I have and it is unscathed). The band I think is great but I did see where some people have broken there\u2019s. No worries though because there are replacement bands through AmazFit and aftermarket; I bought an elastic breathable band and replacement was easy. UNSCREW THE LEFT SIDE (side with up and down buttons) ONLY! Otherwise you\u2019ll strip the tool. It requires a special tool so make sure the band you order has the tool to remove the screws. Overall the quality is outstanding.Screen clarity, resolution, and readability in the sun is amazing. It will adjust screen brightness automatically depending on the lighting around you. Colors are vivid.And finally accuracy of the metrics for health and sleep seem reliable. I\u2019m not a health nut so I don\u2019t need it to be 100%. That said it tracks on par with Fitbit and various other watches I\u2019ve used. The graphs and layout of information is very in depth yet easy to read. Sleep tracking seems to be very accurate and comes with an optional subscription to allow ai enhanced ambient sounds customized to your sleep pattern. It learns what helps you sleep better and shuts off at the appropriate time and uses a smart alarm the wake you up slowly within 30 minutes of your set alarm. So not to wake you abruptly.This is a game changer for the price and I\u2019m grateful I chose to try out this watch. As long as Amazfit keeps doing what they\u2019re doing, they have me as a customer for life. 5/5 stars!",

Messages are customizable in the app.Note: You can not answer calls or SMS text messages on this watch, but who cares I do not care for those features.Customize Exercise templates to track and work up to your goals. Love that the most.Loads of informationPAIEPOCSleep monitoringHeart rate monitoring while exercising at different LevelsAccurate Step countClose to accurate heart rate tracking....I am talking off by 1/2 a beat or less which is great compared to some of the other watches.App is the Zepp app --> Very good app stable and very smooth to useThere are many features you can add to the watch via app.Watch faces are basic (Freeones)Many different watch faces all from 99 cents to 1.99 Worth it on some of the faces as they can display very clear information and make use of the surface of the watch very optimally.100% Recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My place of work started a Fitness Competition, so I decided it was time to get a new smart watch to track my fitness activities. I decided to buy the T-Rex2.WHAT I LIKE:- Looks great. It looks like a sports watch, which is my preference.- Battery Life is great. I have turned on all the features and the battery lasts almost a week before having to recharge. I do outdoor biking, and mountain biking 5-6 days of the week.- The Zepp app that pairs with the watch is responsive and easy to use. The information is clear and easy to understand.- Syncing the Zepp app with the watch is fast. I was previously using a Fitbit versa2, and that took 10 times longer to sync using the same phone.- The GPS is pretty accurate. Certainly more accurate then my Fitbit versa2.- The price is quite competitive. I paid $200 with coupon. For the price this watch is a great value.- The screen on the watch is responsive and not sluggish like other watches I've used such as the Fitbit versa2.- There are some decent looking free \"skins\" you can download to the watch. (image attached). There also skins you can purchase. I like contrast, as well as having all the info viewable on the watch. However you can also use skins that only show time for example.- It is comfortable to wear. Although it has a decent sized screen, it is still quite lightweight. I do not feel like I am wearing a big ol watch. It doesn't get in the way of any of my activities.WHAT I DON'T LIKE (or could use improvement):- Support with other applications / devices is not quite there. This is my biggest issue. For example. The Fitness Competition App my work uses can be paired with a whole host of applications such as google fit, fitbit, applefit etc.. The Zepp app was not supported. Although I cannot confirm, I suspect you will probably not be able to pair Zepp with other devices such as power output monitoring devices many people use on their bikes.- Other features outside of GPS such as the sleep app are not the most accurate. It will give you a decent ball park figure, but if you want to be as accurate as possible you will probably need to look at a much more expensive Garmin that has more sensors.- The band appears to be attached via a non standard screw. My watch watch did not come with a screw driver that I could find. There are custom bands available on the Amazefit website, so I can only assume that when you purchase one it will come with the right screw driver. (image attached).CONCLUSION:The watch is great, especially for the price. The Zepp app is pretty good, however it could use better cross support with other applications and devices. I am happy with the purchase and have since bought an Amazefit watch for my girlfriend. If you are into fitness however not ultra serious about the data collection, this is a great watch for you. If you are a professional athlete or very serious about data collection, you will probably need to look at a $700 Garmin most likely.Cheers, and happy hunting.",

I have yet to actually use the power-hungry GPS tracking app, but a very nice fitness watch for tracking my daily steps, heart rate, blood O2 levels, stress levels, sleep habits, weather and call and text message notifications. Lots of free faces available with the included Zepp app, as well as other apps available for downloading watch faces. Pretty accurate measurements, and able to link to other health apps like Google Fitness, Strava, etc. I wear this watch 24/7 and has a nice Theatre Mode, where the display can be dimmed down for sleeping or in light-sensitive areas! Would recommend highly as a fitness watch for anyone! A lot cheaper than other popular big brand names. Lots of included apps, fully customizable to whatever fitness routine you need to capture!!",

Pratico corrida ao ar livre, mountain bike e caminhada e o GPS se mostrou praticamente igual ao do celular (Google). - Bateria em um uso padr\u00e3o durou aprox. 20 dias. Se deixar todos sensores de medi\u00e7\u00e3o desativados, pode ser q dure aprox. 25 dias. Tudo vai depender se ligar todos sensores de medi\u00e7\u00e3o do aparelho em um intervalo menor de tempo. Caso o usu\u00e1rio usar medi\u00e7\u00f5es em intervalos menores, a dura\u00e7\u00e3o da bateria pode diminuir drasticamente. (o APP de medi\u00e7\u00e3o do rel\u00f3gio vai emitir um alerta de diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da bateria).CONTRAS: - O pre\u00e7o \u00e9 um dos poucos problemas desse aparelho. Ainda \u00e9 um aparelho caro que oferece um pouquinho menos op\u00e7\u00f5es do que outros concorrentes. Vale ressaltar que o foco do aparelho \u00e9 durabilidade, constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um equipamento forte pra pr\u00e1ticas esportivas, bons sensores de medi\u00e7\u00e3o e uma bateria bem dur\u00e1vel.",

Al\u00e9m de ser mais da metade do valor!Quando o rel\u00f3gio chegou ele estava com 75% de bateria e durou uma semana inteira antes da carga, e mesmo assim aguentou um dia inteiro nos 15%. N\u00e3o tive coragem pra ver se ele iria aguentar o dia seguinte e botei pra carregar a noite. Carga completa em 2h! A bateria \u00e9 maravilhosa! Eu uso ele TODO DIA, ent\u00e3o acho que durou bem.GPS super preciso e touch de qualidade. A tela \u00e9 grande e confort\u00e1vel pra usar e visualizar as informa\u00e7\u00f5es enquanto se est\u00e1 praticando o esporte.Estou muito contente e super indico o T-Rex pra quem n\u00e3o est\u00e1 disposto a pagar um Garmin da vida e mesmo assim ter um smartwhatch de qualidade e que aguente o tranco!",
