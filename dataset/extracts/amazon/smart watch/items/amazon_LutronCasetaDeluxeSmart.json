                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars My electrician recommended these - and with a few glitches, we're thrilled",
                "reviewText": "We were renovating our home office in our attic and as part of it had to update our electrical. I researched tons of smart home products, and decided against anything that required special bulbs (Hue) and anything that wasn't Homekit compatible. Why Homekit? Because the data isn't stored on the cloud, isn't sold, and must be encrypted per Apple standards. Using the Homekit app on our phone is a nice perk, but 99% of the time we use the Lutron app.The switches once installed and linked to the hub are incredibly easy to use as just normal dimmers with decent sized buttons so even grandma is happy. Setting preset dim levels is easy too, so most of the time it's a single touch on, single touch off - already better than 99% of non-smart dimmer switches out there. Pricey - yes - but you get what you pay for. We bought this starter set to get the hub, and then separate switches. My electrician used standard GFI wall plates, and the Lutrons require about the same installation space as a traditional dimmer switch - not overly deep, no special install.The hub is easy - we have it downstairs with our router and it feeds all of the switches in the house plus anything else we want (I'm considering the compatible shades for some of the rooms with a lot of sunlight). It's quite small - a single Ethernet cable to the back of our router, and a small plug into the outlet. I have a dumb email account I never use as our Lutron account - just as I do for our TV and 99% of other smart products (there are even sites that give you a 10 minute email account that is purged afterward - for free).The glitch - some of the \"open box\" orders I placed to Amazon were incomplete. Some had defective switches with corroded wires. Because this was part of a renovation, I didn't find these problems until after the 30 day return window, so I had to call Lutron's support, and they arranged replacements under the 5 year warranty. Also some switches worked, but despite system resets and Lutron's excellent technical support (call as a \"pro\"), they could not connect to the hub despite sitting next to other working switches.The app is very good. Setup via the app is easy. There's one kill switch at the top of the app screen that will turn off all Lutron-connected devices in that room at once - very handy when my kids leave lights on. Once the switch is connected to the app, it's automatically in Homekit. If you are using low-voltage lights (many spot lights are ELV), Lutron makes a special ELV dimmer that you have to use if the lights are in total < 10w. We don't use the remote since it is connected to only one switch and we have many - but I'm adding Lutron Casetas to other rooms that need a three-pole (two light switch) connection - so you use a standard Caseta and the Pico remote with a wall mount (comes with) and a magnetic cover (extra). Super-easy.I waited 4 months to post this review to see how the system would respond to wifi outages, power outages, lightning storms, etc. and it's been fine. When wifi is out, the switches work as normal dimmers. When it comes back on, nothing needs to be reset (which is more than I can say for other systems I've tried like Wemo).Lutron Casetas are expensive, reliable, relatively easy (watch the open boxes and ELV fixtures), and the LIVE tech support is very helpful. Each switch contains info and diagrams for installation and connecting to the hub. I wish they carried more Pro products because these are excellent.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The \u201cno longer a newbie\u201d take: Lutron's Hub vs. other Wifi switches",
                "reviewText": "I was once a newbie with Caseta - but no longer, so I hope this helps you. This kit is the first purchase you need for Lutron\u2019s system. Once you have the hub, no more kits are needed for future switch purchases. One hub can manage up to 75 switches (and I think the Hub is included in that count).Some buyers complain about having to wire in Lutron's hub to your network with an ethernet cable. But you can't beat the speed and reliability of a wired network connection. Given that Lutron\u2019s product works reliably and is 100% responsive all the time, this is a non-issue for me.Since I put in the first few Casetas, we truly love them and have started to replace switches all over the home. Which brings up another issue... if I had chosen a WiFi connected switches (and I did briefly for use in limited locations, more on that later) I could potentially be adding a much larger number of connected devices onto my network. If your WiFi isn't all that great to begin with - think entry level routers - this could potentially impact network performance and your connectivity with your switches. For me, that's just a no go. I really want my WiFi to work well for the things that need to be on it.The PROs of the Lutron Switches:Setting the switches up is straightforward and fast. The setup process works like expected each and every time. I cannot say the same about other non-Lutron WiFi products.Having problems setting them up or is a switch not acting right? Lutron\u2019s support is the bees knees. They have helped me several times and each time they are great.The switches are incredibly responsive both in person and via the app. There are no delays in turning things off and on. The ceiling fan switch is especially a godsend for our old ceiling fan - no more standing on the bed to pull strings or getting up out of bed to adjust things.Lutron and Ring also teamed up and added some camera integrations where movement and/or doorbell pushes can activate lights. It works quite well, but the feature was a little buried in the Lutron app. Big bonus - the integration will also turn off lights after 15 minutes.About the app (and this is a biggie)Purchasing good hardware is one thing, having an app that you only get to experience after you purchase the hardware is downright crazy. But that's the world that smart switches seem to live in, so here's the scoop on Lutron - and the apps for a couple other systems I tried.Lutron's app is well designed and intuitive. You can quickly add new devices, program in schedules and scenes. The app also interfaces with my Lennox thermostat to display the current temp in the home (with the help of Apple's Home (home kit) app that's running on a dedicated iPad that never leaves the home). The Ring cam integration is good too.Having tried WeMo and Leviton's WiFi connected switches, my take on those apps is that they are incredibly clunky. This seems like a misstep, especially when you are going to spend most of your time interfacing with the app than the switch.Since I also use Apple's Home app with my family, every time a switch gets added into the Lutron hub, it seamlessly shows up in Apple Home. This is of course magically great. Since I didn't want to add another app into the mix for my wife and family, it's nice that there have been zero issues with cross platform integration, everything works seamlessly.The Lutron App also has a geofence capability that will turn on/off lights when you arrive and depart from the home. Haven't used that yet, but it's cool. Another side benefit, Lutron's app has an Apple watch app that you can control lights and fans with.The CONS:Edited - The Caseta hub for whatever reason didn\u2019t have auto off timers built in. That said, the addition of their motion sensor product effectively solves this issue.If you have Ring cams, you can turn on the Caseta integration, and a motion or doorbell can turn on lights and after 15 minutes, turn them off again. This works beautifully.Other thoughts:Edited - I used IFTTT (If This Then This) before Ring and Lutron added their cam integration as a trigger to turn on/off lights. IFTTT works, but there was always a bit of a delay to turn on lights if you use it. Plus if you\u2019re internet went down, it didn\u2019t work.Before the Ring integration, I used a couple WeMo switches for my outdoor lighting as they had auto-off timers. But their setup and app was super clunky. Happy to be rid of them.As software support is now kinda important for app driven switches, making sure you get a switch from a company that's going to be around a while is more important than it used to be. It would be bad if your OS on your phone, requires your apps to get an update and your smart switch maker is MIA.Side note - For the two years I had WeMo switches, changes in Wifi forced me to individually reconnect all switches to it, and it was a horrible process to get them re-paired with WiFi. Lutron has never had this issue, being wired into the network.One switch I purchased from Amazon warehouse (open box) had issues with setup and Lutron\u2019s support was fantastic. They sent a replacement switch so quickly and were really nice about it.Bottom line - stick with Lutron, it works really well.",

                "reviewText": "These dimmers seem to work great. I've installed about 7 so far with a few types of regressed ceiling lights and wall sconces and they all dim smoothly.Pros:- Smooth on/off dimming. You can press and hold to change the brightness level, or tap, and it has a lot of levels between 0 and 100% so you don't get that \"skipping\" effect some dimmers have.- When the dimmer is off, there is a slight green glow to the brightness level indicator on the left side of the switch. It's very subtle, doesn't distract and helps you find it in the dark- Works with every type of light I've tested so far. \"Dim to warm\" ceiling and sconces light on and off smoothly over 1-2 seconds and look great.- Allows for wireless \"3 way switches\". This saved me a lot of electrical wiring work when I wanted two switches across an empty room to control the same lights. You can stick the wireless one anywhere, program it quickly and make it blend in with other switches.Cons:- This particular pack only has the round center \"scene\" button on the wireless switch. This may not be an issue to most, but if you press the regular \"on\" button, lights automatically go to the brightest setting, not to whatever level you had them at last time. The scene button can turn lights on just to 30% or whatever you set it to. If that's important to you, go buy the version with a scene button on all switches, wired and wireless.",
