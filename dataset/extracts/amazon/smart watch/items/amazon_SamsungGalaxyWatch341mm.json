                "reviewText": "The watch came in a generic box but was bubble wrapped inside. The item was pre disassembled but each part was well protected. It was fine since I was going To be using a different silicon band I had ordered from Amazon anyway. The watch was not charged yet so I placed on the charger and within a few minutes it showed it was charging. The device I ordered was the 44mm version and it's gorgeous and has a large touch screen and the specific model (Galaxy 3) has a rotating bezel to navigate also so your not stuck only touching it. It's looks new and not refurbished at all. I bought It in mystic silver and it looks sharp with the orange band or any color real being that it's silver. Much better than all black like a lot of other watches and definitely not boring to the eyes. The clean lines really pop with the shiny silver reflection from the light. Lets me control the Bluetooth in my car on SoundCloud and I can touch the screen or rotate the bezel to change tracks on my playlists which is pretty cool! I also can answer calls or reply to texts on the watch without having my phone on me which is awesome and convenient. I can also change the watch face to custom pics like my cat or me and my gf. I love the sleep tracker that tells me REM, deep,and overall amount of sleep, my heart rate,blood pressure and steps. I can set goals for the day or week and when you meet them it vibrates and says Good job. I can also voice reply messages with the built-in mic. So many features for u der 70 dollars. I don't know why you would need to buy one new. Amazon stands by the product and returns are easy if there is anything not right. Refurbished is better than new because it's tested and made sure to work correctly unlike a new item that is done by the end consumer. I bought my gf one and me and was still less money than a new one.",

                "reviewText": "I love that the screen looks brand new, no pixels are broken, no scratches on the screen. Perfect functionality, operating system works 100%.Only reasons I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars, was due to wrong band size so I had to purchase one at Best Buy. And because it has more scratches than expected for the refurbished quality(it\u2019s not like i wouldn\u2019t purchase it again just it\u2019s more than expected).^note that this may not happen to you just look out for that.Couple things to expect, the band and charger that came in the box with it are both off brand , they were not original to the watch. But the charger works good, just not original to the watch if that was what you were hoping/ looking for.The battery does last long, wore it since 4am till 7pm and was only at 67%.10/10 would recommend as a gift for someone.!! Quite cheap for everything I got!The band was definitely not great quality so maybe purchase a different one regardless.",

Texts can be composed and sent to anyone in contact list (some watches I've tried only allow preset quick replies). Watch can call on wifi without phone nearby but the range it stays connected is actually great. The speaker is on the top side of the face so it doesn't muffle when I move my wrist. Many of the optional faces are very customizable.Does most everything I wanted from a watch except I am unable to play my Amazon Music through it and the battery lasts about 20 hrs, give or take a couple (and I like the sleep monitor function so sucks to charge it so often).",
