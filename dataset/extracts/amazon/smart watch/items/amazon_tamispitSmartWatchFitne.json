Standard but comfortable band.Large number of screen formats to pick from- found one I really like near the end of the list!Battery life exceeds expectations at two weeks or more. Charger is great- watch clips into it so sure to resist bumps that might cause it to not charge.Description says good for swimming I've not tried it, but showering has been no problem. Haven't worn it into the steam room yet, that was the demise of my last choice (different brand).Heart rate, blood O2 look pretty accurate, but don't count on it for BP (no surprise).Sleep tracking seems a bit off, but OK for subjective \"good\" or \"not good\" night's sleep.Phone-side app is pretty basic, but does the job. I would love to see a feature that lets you download data to csv.Very good watch, would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The watch does everything you want it to do at a reasonable price. This is the new basic -- calculates steps, tells time, gives heart rate, has multiple options for face plates. It does everything fine but nothing great. For instance, the steps sometimes show up a 5-10 seconds late and then comes all at once, which has caused me to question whether the number is accurate. I've concluded from my non-scientific test that the steps are accurate there is just a delay occasionally. The App works fine but you need the app to do everything, like set time, which is why I only gave 4 stars. I should be able to set time on the watch. The battery is okay; not a long lasting Apple watch but this is about 1/10th the price. I call that a win!",

                "reviewText": "The app worked pretty good. The body temp, heart rate, and BP seemed to work and detect with a +/- ~5-7% which is REALLY good for a watch of this quality. BP measured @ 124/62 which is probably a bit low for me, but not so far that I scratched my head and thought this thing is WAY off. The body temp was @ 96.2F and granted, I was in a room with an ambient temp of 62F and near an A/C unit that was on. After I moved away from it, it measured @ 98.2 which is perfect. The sleep tracker I could never get to work so I have no data to supply, and you can't just go to sleep when you want to test something like this. The steps tracking was not the key feature I bought a smart watch for, but it seemed to sit at ~5-7% +/-, which is not bad (for me, since I really do not care) but might be a bit too much for someone who is into fitness. The heart rate monitor was also spot on, sitting around 62-68 for me in a sitting position with no movement or stress level. Blood oxygen level had me @ 97%, and I really do not have a way to measure this otherwise...so we can assume it is within 1-2% of correct since I wasn't gasping for air or on the verge of passing out, or hyperventilating. The music controls worked, (play, pause, next song etc along with a small interface for EQ style) the messaging worked, (view only, there is no respond function) and there is a timer, stopwatch and a find function - all of which worked well.This is not an Apple watch, nor is it a Samsung watch. HOWEVER: For the price, this is a very capable smart watch that works with Android and iOS and will connect to your health APP on either. (Apple's \"Health\" app for me)",

It tracks steps, calories burned, sleep, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, and temperature. The GloryFit app is great for keeping track of your health throughout the day and can be a good index for health improvement. It also has different sports profiles to train. Im a soccer player and the soccer profile tracks heart rate and calories burned while giving a graph of the moments your heart rate was at its highest and lowest. The running profile tracks your distance additionally. Overall, a great first smart watch.",

                "reviewText": "First off, the price is great! I like the looks of the watch and the size of the watch face. Another reviewer mentioned that the watch comes in three separate pieces within the box and that's true -- the watch face and two watchbands. I put one of the sides of the band backward (not the one with the clasp). I never changed it back because it was not easy to move the spring mechanism to switch around, so I just left it as it was. I don't believe the step counter is really accurate. It's not a big deal for me because I have a step counter on my phone. The heart monitor seems pretty accurate. I like having it (I am a heart patient.) It is not sophisticated at all, but it is good to have to see the high and low ranges for the day. I barely use the app (it's called GloryFit). It probably has some cool bells and whistles that I won't use. In closing, I have had the watch for about a month. I have charged it three times. One time it didn't charge and I couldn't tell, so when I took the watch off the charger it had no battery life, so I couldn't use the watch that day. I wish the watch gave some type of low battery warning. EDIT it has a battery life indicator, you just need to choose the correct clock-face. It does not show the battery life on each clock face. The charge lasts about five days which is pretty good! All in all, I am happy with my purchase.",

Measures temp, steps, heart rate, blood pressure, sleep etc.Dislikes: stops recording steps, sleep, everything until I restart it. Happens every other day or so. I usually don't realize it has stopped until halfway through a workout or in the morning when I look up sleep. The sleep monitor is not accurate. If I get up but am not excessively active (walking more than 1/4 mile non-stop), it will continue to record me was sleeping. Blood pressure always reads the same readings, which is wrong. Gps not all that accurate. I have a known length course I walk regularly, it measures it a different distance every time, few are accurate to the distance I have measured other ways.I purchased the watch mainly to track activity, which it does fairly well when it works. It's annoying when it records me as sleeping as I'm drinking coffee in the morning, but it's not a game changer",
