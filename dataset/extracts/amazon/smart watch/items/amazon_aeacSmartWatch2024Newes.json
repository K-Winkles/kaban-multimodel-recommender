                "reviewText": "When I buy a smart watch, there are certain things (features & functions) that I always look for. I do not care much for the accuracy of heart beat rate, SPO2...etc because I fully understand that these economic types (under $50) watches does not really provide accurate data. So as long as those data are somewhat accurate and useful enough, I am fine with it.for me, the most important things are the following : a lot of useful watch faces that I can download and switch back and forth, thru the watch, not via app.Tennis fitness app (I am a tennis coach) among other useful (at least for me) sport apps. very loud alarm and timer, so that it can wake me up. 44mm and up big size watch for my 7.4 inch wrist. Large battery....etcAs for watch faces, it has a lot. A lot of good ones that I can use. Also, I can delete pre-installed all the watch faces and upload with all new ones. Many other lower cost smart watches do not have this feature. I can only upload one or two that I like and I have to keep the pre-installed faces which I can not delete nor replace. As for this watch, Yes, you can basically delete all the pre-installed faces with your choice of watch faces, up to 8 of them.As for the battery life, it claims that it has 300 mAh. That is pretty big size and I think that it will last for few days.It also has a lot of fitness choices. More than 100 of them and I think that most of us can really choose what we like. Also, the app (Veryfit) can allow the watch to upload only the fitness apps that we are willing to use. Veryfit app is a very useful and well designed app for lower end watches.And the feature that I like the most is the alarm and timer. Most of watches, including expensive ones costing over $100 or more, only comes with weak vibration for alarm and timer. But this one has the \"real alarm\" sound. Not vibration, but the piercing & loud sound that will really wake you up. I had a lot of smart and fitness tracker watches, but this one is the only one that has the actual alarm sound coming out of the watch speaker. I really like this feature.This is big size enough for my wrist and the screen quality isn't so bad either. It is not amoled screen, but you really can not expect amoled for this price. However, screen is very nice and it is bright enough.I guess that the only draw back that this watch has is the strap. You can not really change to different strap because it has its own proprietary lug designs (as you can see from the photo). However, the strap is nice and soft and comfortable though...It comes with a very simple and cheap looking gift box and inner plastic container (which even looks cheaper) but as long as the watch works and it works great for me, I do not mind.",

The pins are not spring loaded, they are a solid steel piece. Anyway he was able to use plyers and manipulate the black hooking clasp under the latch and get it facing the correct way. Unfortunately I had to pay $10.60 for this repair. All in all the watch itself is very nice and has worked great the past few days I\u2019ve been able to wear it. For the price it is an excellent value but I am concerned that the band, latch, and clip having to be manipulated will wear down quicker than they should.This is an add on to my first review. I had to order a second watch because the first just stopped working...I received the new one and set it up but the charger that came with it will not work so within 3 days the watch is dead and I have no way of recharging it.",
