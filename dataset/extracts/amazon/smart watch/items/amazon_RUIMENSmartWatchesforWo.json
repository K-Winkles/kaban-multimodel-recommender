Then turn on phone's bluetooth and connect the watch in the app. It can work with most smartphones that use iOS 9.0 or Android 6.0 or above system (not work for PC and tablet). Q: Is the band changeable? and what is the size of the replacement band? Yes, the band is changeable. The band width is 22mm(0.87inch). Q: How to measure my heart rate & steps more accurately? 1. Please make sure your personal info(age,height,weight) in GloryFit app are filled in correctly.(Go to GloryFit app -> Profile) 2. Wearing too tight, raising the arm and making a fist, etc. will affect your blood circulation and thus affect the heart rate signal. It is normal that the heart rate data will be volatile at first, please wait for the heart rate value to stabilize before taking a reading. You will find that the data will be more accurate, if you measure more times and test longer. Q: Why can't your watch receive SMS and notifications? 1. Please ensure the permissions of App, messages, calls, etc. are allowed when you download the GloryFit app for the first time. 2. Allow the GloryFit app to send notifications: Open your phone settings--> Find \u201cGloryFit\u201d app--> Notifications--> Click \u201cAllow Notifications\u201d--> Tick Lock Screen/Notification Center/banners, and tick \u201cAlways(Default)\u201d in Show Previews. 3. In the App: please switch on notification reminder in \"Gloryfit\". (Go to the app -> device -> SMS/APP -> switch on SMS, Facebook, other, etc.). Do not enable the \"Do not Disturb Mode\". *Note: Check whether the App's messages appear in pop-up box of your mobile phone. If no, the watch will fail to receive messages. Make sure they are able to show up: Phone Settings-->Notifications> Find the app you need to get notification from-->Allow Notifications.",

                "reviewText": "This watch is a wonderful affordable smart watch that does everything that you need!This watch has many features available that most pricey watches have, except it\u2019s a lot more affordable. It can:- track sleep- heart rate- steps- blood oxygen- menstrual cycle- take calls- show texts- check the weather- calculator- customize watch faces- set alarms- play mini gamesthe watch is very well built! it feels almost on par to more expensive watches (apple, fitbit, etc.) while doing what said watches can do.the watch band is stylish, stretchy, and comfortable. I wore it while sleeping, working, running, etc. And it never hurt my wrist or woke me up due to being uncomfortable.everything I listed above is included in a single app. you can check your health information through the app rather than using multiple.the screen is bright and colorful, and everything is easy to use and see.the touch display feels smooth and feels exactly like an apple watch\u2019s touch display.the ui is also easy to navigate and you can customize how you navigate. similar to an Apple Watch, you can set the menu to be bubble-like or a simple list you scroll through to access applications. I never had any issues with the screen glitching out or being too slow.the screen is large! 46mm to be exact. my wrists are super tiny so the screen covered most of my wrist, but it\u2019s comfortable so it wasn\u2019t an issue.THE BATTERY LIFE. this watch has lasted days on one charge, which is what stood out to me the most when comparing to high end watches!! It\u2019s advertised to last 5 days with normal use but 30 days in standby on a two hour charge. I found charging the watch to 100% took way less than two hours, though I didn\u2019t track the exact time! Currently going 3 days and still around 90% battery.Texts messages and phones calls always show up as well!I found this watch super convenient to use and it\u2019ll make a great gift for those who want a smart watch of any kind!",

Within no time, it automatically updated to the latest software version, and its user-friendly interface made navigation easy.The battery life is good, after a full charge, I can enjoy two full days of usage without needing to recharge. The watch also has common important features like heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and exercise tracking. Plus, it's water-resistant, so I can keep it on while washing my hands or during light rain, and it has been working great so far.The fitness tracker feature offers several sports modes. It automatically tracks my daily activity, providing valuable exercise data, including steps, heart rate, calories, and distance. Additionally, the watch's ability to make and answer calls directly via Bluetooth connection is convenient. The call and message notifications displayed are useful too, although I can't respond to texts directly from the watch. In general, I recommend it for the price, is an affordable, simple, functional, and stylish watch for everyday users.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the RUIMEN smart watch 2023 Ver. in black and have been checking it out for several days now. The setup was rather effortless, and it was easy to pair the watch with my Android phone via Bluetooth. It also charges very fast, and the battery lasts for over 3-4 days.I\u2019m a petite person, and this watch feels light, and the band is adjustable to fit nicely on my small wrist. It is also comfortable to wear while sleeping. The watch is also waterproof, so you can wear it during workouts and swimming.The HD color display is sharp, very responsive to touch and is a decent size. One of the exciting features for me is the option to customize the watch face with a picture of my cats. They also have numerous other watch faces to choose from and I can change them to match what I wear. It also has a flashlight function which is very useful at night.The fitness tracker features of the watch are comparable to Fitbit and Google Fit that I have used in the past. It has several sport modes to choose from, and tracks steps, heart rate and blood oxygen levels almost as accurately as the other trackers. It also has comparable sleep tracker functions to monitor your sleep quality and duration.You can easily make and receive phone calls and text messages directly from the watch. It also has music playback control which is very nice.The app could use some work as far as English usage is concerned but it does not limit its functionality.Overall, it is a budget-friendly smart watch with many amazing features.",

Iniziamo con il design: questo smartwatch ha una forma elegante e moderna, con un display touchscreen ampio e luminoso che rende la navigazione intuitiva. \u00c8 leggero e confortevole da indossare tutto il giorno.Offre una vasta gamma di funzioni, tra cui monitoraggio della frequenza cardiaca, tracciamento del sonno, GPS integrato e persino la possibilit\u00e0 di ricevere notifiche dal mio smartphone. Queste caratteristiche sono estremamente utili per tenere traccia della mia salute e rimanere connesso in modo efficiente.La durata della batteria \u00e8 stata una piacevole sorpresa.Un aspetto che potrebbe migliorare \u00e8 la compatibilit\u00e0 con le app di terze parti. Non tutte le app che uso quotidianamente sono completamente integrate, il che pu\u00f2 essere un po' limitante.In generale, \u00e8 un dispositivo eccellente per chi cerca un equilibrio tra stile, funzionalit\u00e0 e durata della batteria. Con un prezzo competitivo, \u00e8 una scelta intelligente per chiunque voglia migliorare il proprio stile di vita con un po' di tecnologia al polso.",
