So much so that I hope they continue making the same kind of fit and style, quality and price for the next several years so I can keep purchasing it in different sizes as my children grow.I have 4 kids and have gone through several winter jackets over the years. Disappointed by many. This one doesn\u2019t disappoint in anyway at all for us.The hood is large enough to actually fight my child\u2019s head with some room but doesn\u2019t easily fall back like many other jackets do. The buttons on the hood make it so you can make the hood just a little more snug around their head for extra warmth. You can also easily remove the hood if wanted, by zipper.The jacket is a nice length, covering the bum. We\u2019ve had So many jackets before that would end at the hip and didn\u2019t provide as much warmth as this one. The inside is nice and fuzzy and thick, again providing more warmth.And it doesn\u2019t hurt that the pattern is also very cute.I love this winter coat and I love that I don\u2019t have to worry if my child is warm or covered enough!!",

The price is unbelievable because something like this is usually very expensive. It\u2019s fashionable and will not disappoint. I sized up and it definitely doesnt look too big, also I don\u2019t want to buy a new jacket every year. It fits very well when we do one fold on the sleeves. Definitely good for the next two years!",

                "reviewText": "Great quality kids jacket! I was looking for something knee length for my daughter to wear to school when it\u2019s cold in the morning. This jacket happened to be on a \u201cLimited Deal\u201d and it popped up when I searched for the Columbia brand. I decided to give it a whirl since the price was discounted. And I thought she\u2019d like the burnt orange color. Honestly, I\u2019d pay full price for this jacket now that I see what great quality it is and how much my 9 year old loves it.It\u2019s not heavy, but it\u2019s definitely not a \u201clight weight\u201d jacket. Lately, it\u2019s been in the high 40\u2019s to mid 50\u2019s in the morning here and this jacket has been keeping her warm.The jacket body and hood are Sherpa lined\u2026and it\u2019s soft Sherpa, not the cheap itchy kind. The hood is removable. It\u2019s easy enough for a child to remove and reattach it - very happy about that.I will probably purchase this again next year for her, if it\u2019s still available. :)",
