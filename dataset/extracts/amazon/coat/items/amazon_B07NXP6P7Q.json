                "reviewText": "This product is amazing quality and an absolute steal for the price. I was really surprised. it\u2019s very durable and nice thick fabric. it keeps you warm but it doesn\u2019t make you hot. it keeps your body warmth in. You can dress it up or down. I use it to run errands with just some sweat pants and tennis shoes, or to nicer, dressier events. I am 5\u201d2, 150-155 lbs with most of my weight in my hips/butt area. I ordered an XL. it fits perfect for me and i\u2019m able to button it with room left to be comfortable. it\u2019s a bit long on my arms but i don\u2019t mind. it\u2019s also a bit long on my legs, but that\u2019s just a place because it keeps my legs warm too! i should also note that it also fits my 6 ft 140 something lbs boyfriend like a glove. anyway, if you\u2019re even considering buying this, DO IT. just do it. i pondered for a long time, and i\u2019m so glad that i bought it. You can\u2019t get a better price for this quality.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the camel color and absolutely love it. I've tried several different coats this winter and this is the only one I kept. I bought a large (5'6, 175 lbs). Fits true to size, is fully lined, and has no stretch to it. It is somewhat fitted, so if I wanted to wear bulky sweaters and such underneath I would have needed to size up. I found it to be very comfortable both buttoned and unbuttoned. It gives a nice long silhouette (hiding all the middle age \"insulation\" underneath quite nicely). I live in a region that has moderate winters with only a few very cold snaps and I could see myself wearing this coat comfortably throughout. I wore it during the recent cold snap and was comfortably warm without overheating. It has some weight to it, but did not make me feel like it was dragging me down. Big, functional pockets. Looks just as classy as some of the more expensive coats that I tried on. The style is on trend, but also classic so I can see myself being able to wear it for years to come. Very pleased with this coat so far.",

This feels and looks like the level of quality I was searching for without the big price tag.For reference I\u2019m 5\u20191, 155, busty and ordered a medium.
