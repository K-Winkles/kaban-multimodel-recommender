                "reviewText": "I really like this jacket. I got the khaki - which is more orangey than it sounds. Really good color. It arrives vacuum sealed and feels like a board, but as soon as you open and remove it from the sealed package, it starts to take shape. I washed mine immediately to see how it fared. Washed in cold and dried on low setting. No problems with washing / drying. I have worn a couple of times now and have had no issues with fuzz getting on my clothes - like some other reviews claimed. The zipper is awful - which I expected based on other reviews. Cheap and catches in the fuzz of the jacket, so difficult to zip. That is why I gave only 4 stars. The jacket is unlined, so just as soft on the inside as it is on the outside. Very warm despite being unlined. I usually wear a medium in most tops and ordered the large for an oversized fit. I like the way it fits - big and cozy. For reference, I am about 5'5\" and 140 pounds. I have ordered another color at this point and am considering a 3rd - maybe with a hood. All in all, I think it is a good value for the price (I paid about $32).",

As\u00ed que me arriesgu\u00e9 pidiendo una talla m\u00e1s grande que la que usa habitualmente, y le qued\u00f3 perfecta.El material es super suave y c\u00f3modo.

I usually get smalls in jackets but wanted this to be much over-sized to fit todays trend. I ordered a large and am keeping it! It look like the picture and has a soft, teddy-bear like feel. Great for layering in fall or with a heavy sweater (which works with the over size of it). I could have gone with a medium and it still would have looked fashionable and on trend, but I will keep the large.UPDATE- Still in love with it. I work in a high school, and have teenagers commenting on the jacket. They all think it is from Aritzia, and are shocked to learn how much I actually spent. Still fits great, looks great and have not had any issues thus far.",

                "reviewText": "Had low expectations because I read the poor reviews primarily. But this met my expectations especially for the price. Is it the highest quality? No. It\u2019s true what they say about the zipper being fiddly. But mine arrived fluffy and clean and soft. I put it in the dryer on air-only setting to get any dust and loose fabric out and it\u2019s been great since. I am tempted to wear it everywhere because it\u2019s so cold right now but I got the light pink one and it isn\u2019t exactly the most chic color for my coloring. it\u2019s a very light baby pink and looks more like a house coat unless i dress it up properly with shoes and accessories. I am 5\u20196 and 118 lbs and I got the extra large. Its very roomy which is what I wanted. It covers my bum and the arm length is perfect. I am tempted to get another color because I really want to wear it everywhere and not just at the grocery store or during the school run. But I already have too many jackets. Disclaimer: I haven\u2019t washed it yet so I don\u2019t know if quality will hold up. But extended wear hasn\u2019t made it deteriorate yet.",
