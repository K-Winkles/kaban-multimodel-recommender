The sleeves are too long as I expected they would be but the coat is worth the added cost of having the sleeves altered. Very nice quilted lining too. Very warm and comfortable. You won\u2019t find a better quality coat anywhere and the sale prices make it more than affordable.",

                "reviewText": "So this jacket is a modern slimmer cut interpretation of the classic pea coat. Where a traditional pea coat is large and boxy in order to fit over several layers, this coat fits more like a sportcoat. I'm 6'1\", 196 lbs. I wear a 44R suit coat with 34W pants. I wanted a slimmer fitting pea coat for the less chilly days when a t-shirt or button down was being worn. This coat sizing is perfect for that. Shoulder seams fall perfectly and it is just roomy enough through the waist. If I wanted to wear a sweater or layer thicker clothing, this would be too tight and I would wear a traditional cut pea coat. Length is on par with the length you would find on a suit or sport jacket. The material is a softer, lighter weight, tighter woven fabric. Again warm enough for cool days, probably want something heavier if your in a colder climate or just don't tolerate cold very well. The underside of the collar has a bit of the same material used to line the jacket sewn in as a contrast. Not sure whether I like it or not, but this is a design choice and is only seen if you pop the collar to seal up your neck. Now as others have mentioned the quality control is a little off. The right side lower buttons are sewn through to the inside causing and odd constriction near the pocket. It is not sewn through the pocket and is easily remedied by removing the thread and restitching the buttons. For $80 or less, I feel this is a good coat that can have the minor QC issues easily remedied. For any higher cost or for a true original sizing or warmth level, keep looking. I already own a traditional cut wool pea coat, so this fit my needs at a reasonable price point. I would recommend this coat to others with the same needs as I.",

The color is rich and deep, the texture look really smooth and polish and the material look really upscale. I carefully inspected the stitching, buttons and pockets lining and every little detail is perfect. My skin has always been sensitive to wool and it was my neck area itches a little the first day or two but now I get used to it.It's a heavy jacket so it's really warm and I like that I can cover my neck area unlike other men's over coat that I have. It's a heavy jacket so it keeps me warm even when temperature was 31 degrees the other day and windy. But it's not overly heavy like my other full length overcoats. And because it is not a full length coat it makes it much easier to get in and out of cars.This high quality coat definitely does the Nautica name justice and I am really glad I paid a little more for this coat than other brand that I was considering. It's definitely worth the money and I trust that it will serve me well for many years to come.",
