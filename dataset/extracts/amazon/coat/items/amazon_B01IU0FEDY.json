The size I ordered ended up fitting perfectly, so I'm glad that I did go up a size. The coat is great quality, and is perfect for use in my labs! The pockets are deep, and there are plenty of them, which is definitely a plus. If you're required to have a coat that is a certain length, I would recommend going up a couple sizes, because while the coat fits me perfectly, it is a bit shorter than what I had expected (I am 5'8\" and ordered a large; it goes to about two inches above my knees when I'm standing). It also washes really well; I've washed it a few times (after spilling chemicals on it in the lab) and it looks practically brand new still! Overall, it is a really great lab coat, just make sure that you go up a size to get a good fit.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Proportioned incorrectly for Petites",
                "reviewText": "I ordered Medium, since I am size 10 and wanted some room for street clothes without bagginess. My initial thought was that it was too small because it was tight over my hips. However it was roomy on the chest. Then I realized it is proportioned for a taller person. I am 5\u20194\u201d, the global mean for a female and the transition between petite and regular sizes. The sleeves, the waistline, the bust, and the hips were all correct in length/circumference as t on the sizing chart. However, the waistline was too low: it fell about 6 cm/2+ inches below my natural waist, over the maximum width of my hips, making the labcoat appear too tight. The waist also was not adjustable to cinch it up. Altering this labcoat to make it fit would be major surgery and should not be necessary. A labcoat that is fitted like this should be manufactured in petite, regular, and tall categories. Too bad! The fabric felt excellent: thick and sturdy. The workpersonship looked great. If only it had been proportioned for my height, this labcoat would have looked wonderful. Petites beware. This is likely why some reviews say \u201csize up\u201d and others say \u201csize down\u201d. I am reluctantly ordering a straight labcoat instead.",
