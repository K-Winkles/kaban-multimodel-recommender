                "reviewText": "The coat style is nice and I like it very much the way it looks. I got the yellow color, which I find nice and happy color in gloomy rainy days. The coat is very comfortable and has nice large pockets and a nice lining. I was looking for a lightweight coat that I could wear all year round since I don't like heavy coats and even less getting wet in rainy days. Particularly good is the fact that this coat has a nice hood that covers well and can be made snug with cord adjustments. The hood is very well made, and also a positive thing for me is the fact that it has a small visor-type front that protects my eyeglasses from getting wet. I was looking forward to wearing this coat when I walk my dog as it would allow me walk in the rain without having to carry an umbrella. The first time I wore the coat it was raining quite heavily, I was out 30 minutes but under the coat my clothes stayed dry. But from the second time onwards, this coat did no longer protect me from the rain, and each time I wore it without an umbrella I got completely drenched in water. I must say I am a quite disappointed by the fact that the description said it is a waterproof coat because obviously it is not waterproof. I assume the material might have been sprayed with some type of solution to make it water resistant - though not waterproof - but that after one use it had worn off. I think this coat was shipped from China so returning it was not an option, so I may still use the it when I am able to also bring my umbrella with me but otherwise I'll have to shop for a new coat that is really waterproof hence my disappointment with it and my only 1 star rating.",

Sleeves are long but when you fold them up, that\u2019s when the contrasting stripes are seen. The overall length of the coat is good.The waist tie is actually very high on me, a good 2-3\u201d above my waist, and I think it should be on the inside, but inside, or outside, I wish it had those little locking clips to keep it where you set it.It is very wrinkled when taken out of the package so I\u2019ll have to steam and/or iron itI bought this coat nearly a year ago ago and I still have not worn it - I should\u2019ve returned it. Maybe I\u2019ll wear it this Fall",
