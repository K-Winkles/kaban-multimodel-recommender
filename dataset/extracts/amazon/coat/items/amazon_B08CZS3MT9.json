I bought a size medium blue dress and the fit is perfect around the top. It is very roomy around the middle but still looks good, not baggy. The fabric is smooth, soft, so comfy! I washed it in cold water and hung to dry. Some wrinkling but not bad, and who cares, anyway--it's a house dress! Perfect for working around the house. Love the big pockets, so useful. Love it so much I am buying another solid cotton one in a different color.",

                "reviewText": "The fit is perfect, it is comfortable & well made = sturdy. I didn't especially like white covers with a snap closure. As the print I selected is the black background with small to medium-sized white flowers all over the dark background, the white-flowers camouflage the round white snap covers down the front seam of this garment. I was searching for Hawaiian Muu Muus when this popped up. However, 100% Cotton Fabric is difficult to find & this is 100% cotton. As I'll be spending my 1st Summer in the Mojave Desert in California, and it's already 80\u00b0F's to 90\u00b0F so I had to buy this garment to be cooler & more comfortable. This garment is also quite comfortable to sleep in bed wearing. I haven't laundered it yet but soon & I'll add those results after it has hung dry. I love this \"robe\" & want to wear it every day as it is the most comfortable summer garment I now own. Buy it! You will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "This Housecoat is just the thing to clean in. I get warm when I\u2019m cleaning. I don\u2019t prefer wearing pants at home. Especially when I\u2019m cleaning. Bathrobes are thick and often hot for wearing while cleaning too. Plus no matter what I wear to clean up in it gets dusty, dirty, or wet.It\u2019s taken a long time to decide to overhaul my wardrobe. I bought this Housecoat as a start. The material is light. It fits well. And it\u2019s about the right length, for the Spring and Summer. Something has to be worn under this item because it is see through. This can be dressed up a little. If company suddenly comes over, unexpectedly, a few accessories will work: a belt, a beaded necklace, bracelet and a pair of low pumps should suffice. I would keep those handy to quickly add on, but not to use while I\u2019m cleaning.As part of my overhauling I\u2019m going to buy more of these to be added to other indoor type garments: Longer Sleeve House garments for cleaning when it\u2019s colder, Nightwear, for nighttime, and Loungers for daywear. The ideal is to wear the appropriate garment at the appropriate time.",
