                "reviewText": "So my current job has me working outside for multiple hours in the mountains. I needed a good coat to keep me warm. A coat that would cover my butt and thighs, and I hate wearing hats, so it also had to have a hood. This completely fits the bill.It\u2019s very lightweight, and very comfortable. But don\u2019t let that make you think that it\u2019s not going to keep you warm, because it\u2019s great at doing that as well. Almost feels like I\u2019m wearing a down comforter as a coat. I don\u2019t think that this will suffice in below zero temperatures. You need something a lot more heavy duty for that. But in normal cold weather, including rain or snow, it should do nicely.At just under 5 feet tall it covers me almost down to my knees. That could have caused a problem with sitting or walking, but fortunately it has a double zipper. So I can unzip the bottom as much as I need to, while having the rest of the coat zipped up to my chin.The detachable hood is roomy and warm. And it lays down nicely without bunching or pulling on the coat. The faux fur is a nice touch. My only complaint is that I wish that the hood had snaps on it so that you could close it up at the bottom when you had the hood up.As for the shape of the coat, it\u2019s nicely fitted, but as it\u2019s a \u201cpuffer\u201d coat it\u2019s not exactly slimming. But that\u2019s the least of my worries. Amazon recommended me the large, but after reading the reviews I decided to size down. And I don\u2019t regret it. In the medium I have enough room to wear thicker clothing if I want, but it\u2019s not hanging off me like a sack.In conclusion, I totally recommend this if you\u2019re looking for a longer coat with a hood that can keep you warm in reasonably cold weather.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this coat and absolutely love it. Not only is it cute but I was immediately warm/hot from just wearing it around my apartment. So this is exactly what I was looking for for the cold winter weather coming up. I did take off the ugly furry zippered trim around the hood cause it looks way better and smaller without it (or choose to remove the hood completely as it\u2019s also zippered). For reference: I\u2019m 5 foot 4 and 147lbs and got the Medium in Black. In pic I only have a long sleeve blouse underneath but could definitely wear a sweater (even a thick one) and would still have room and be comfortable. It also has one very deep pocket on the inside for ur phone & keys and even a small wallet would fit! If ur looking for a very warm, cute and affordable coat, this is it. Hope this review helps ! BTW, if ur interested in the boots in the pics, I also got these here on Amazon from Columbia \u2018Ice Maiden II, love how they match with my coat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this jacket for my teen daughter. The size was exactly as described and the jacket surprised me with its quality and detail (pockets, zippers, thickness of material). My daughter loves how warm it is, but what I love about it the most is how it's just not getting dirty even if it's very light in color (we picked light pink). The product is quite comparable to my brand name winter jacket which I purchased in a traditional retail store for twice the price. Great buy!",

The Amazon Choice badge is well-deserved for this fantastic piece. As soon as I put it on, I felt the immediate warmth and coziness it provides. The coat effortlessly filters raindrops, keeping me dry and comfortable in unpredictable weather.The hood is not only functional but also adds an elegant touch to the overall design. I appreciate the roomy fit, especially for those who prefer a larger size. The inner layer's warmth is exceptional, making this coat perfect for chilly days. The combination of style and functionality makes it a versatile choice for various winter activities. I'm confident that this investment will serve me well throughout the season. Highly recommended!",

She is about 5'7\" tall and very thin 108 lbs so the medium fit her perfectly with a little room for thick clothing. I put pictures of side, front and back of her wearing the coat. It's a beautiful deep shade of purple with removable faux fur trim and hood, plus the zippered pockets have a waterproof layer which is great and the front double zipper is easy to maneuver which is good since sometimes those double zippers are difficult but this one is smooth and doesn't get stuck. This coat has the warm fuzzy inside and super warm. Great coat! Mi hija fria loves it!",
