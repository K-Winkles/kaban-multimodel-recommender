Definitely great for cooking in the summer when the house is already warm and the burners in the kitchen just make it warmer. On top of that, it looks very cool. I like to pretend I\u2019m a Michelin star chef, when I\u2019m really just cooking fun recipes in my tiny kitchen. The utility is also a plus, add an apron and you have enough pockets and holders to never lose that tasting spoon again.",

The 3/4 sleeve is terrific as I hate sleeve cuffs in my way. I wear XXL with a 50\" chest measurement and they fit very well - some reviews say they run large but I cannot confirm. The colors are true, do not fade or bleed. Strongly recommend for hot kitchens or summer months.",
