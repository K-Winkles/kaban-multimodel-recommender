The way the knit sleeve cuffs sit inside the polyester puffer part of the sleeve makes it perfect for wearing with gloves and keeping your wrists warm. I also love that the pockets have a zipper closure. This is great for keeping my phone safe while walking my dog, playing outside with my young child, or snowblowing the driveway. Even though it is light (doesn't weigh much) it's very warm and blocks the wind well.",

I will say that compared to my other coats in the same size (Large) it seems to run a little small, but after some weight loss, my other large coats are too large, so it fits great. The only thing that I feel is missing is there is no drawstring on the hood, but it's definitely not a deal breaker.",
