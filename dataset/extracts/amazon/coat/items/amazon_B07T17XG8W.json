The jacket is very warm, has a lot of pockets (inside and out) to properly store things, and has a very soft and warm lining. It is a good-quality coat, with a strong zipper, nice sized-sleeves, and cuffs that hug your wrist to prevent cold air and snow from getting in. He is very pleased with the coat and I am very pleased with the price. I highly recommend this coat.",

                "reviewText": "Bought for wearing around the house actually. I needed to replace a very worn but warm corduroy jacket and shopped around for a couple of years hoping to find something similar. Levi's corduroy trucker jackets with sherpa lining seemed like a good option but the one I have with a canvas shell is not warm enough so I kept looking. This parka was suggested by Amazon and it was substantially discounted. It's a very warm jacket, well styled, comfortable. Don't need a hood indoors but it's nice to have. Ideally I would have preferred a shorter jacket with a more stylish collar but since I couldn't find one...The thing I like least about the jacket is that some of the inside insulation is sprouting through the shell. It's white spun polyester and must be cut or shaved off since if you try to pull it seems to have no end. Also the jacket is made of 100% polyester and doesn't breathe as well as my cotton shell corduroy jacket did but it's not bad.It's easy to wipe it clean if you spill something on it. In general I'm happy with it. Meets or exceeds my requirements for style, comfort, washability, and warmth at a decent price. I expect it will be reasonably durable, but only time will tell.",

This jacket has a huge oversized zipper that works faultlessly. In addition, many pockets and very nicely made of good material. A favorite of mine that is warm and fashionable without spending hundreds of dollars.",

You would need to wear some jacket inside this to keep the wind from coming at your stomach.3. Zippers are rough. ALL of them. You will need some lubricant to smooth them.4. The hat attached is fit for my big head, but it causes static hair, which HURTS!!! I didn\u2019t see that coming\u2026Overall, for the price range, it is good.",
