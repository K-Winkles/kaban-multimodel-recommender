                "reviewText": "The jacket is cute and fits great, however the style is more fitted towards a teen or 20 something year old, not a woman pushing 40. I will be returning, but here are some pros & cons.Pros - I'm 5'5, 160 lbs, wear a size 10 jeans, size medium shirt, and am a 34DDD top and the medium coat fit great. The material is puffy and would probably be pretty warm paired with a sweater. The hood lining is so soft and it's big and plush. The length is perfect for what I was looking for and hit me mid thigh.Cons - the style isn't for me. The material of the black jacket is really shiny and the zippers are all gold. There is also a strange cinch cord along the back waist area I'm assuming is so you can cinch for a more fitted look, but you then have this random cord hanging down your backside.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a gift for my grandma, she loves anything pink so I chose the dusty pink color. The pink is slightly darker in person. The jacket itself seems nice, love the shape and length. It has adjustable strings to cinch in the waist. A removable faux fur on the hood but some of the faux fur arrived already stuck in the zipper. Over the entirety of the coat, there were several loose threads and threads that needed to be trimmed. Believe me when I say it was all over the entire coat. I had to take a break from trimming them all away.In the back of the coat, up close, you can see thread holes as if it was sewn wrong, threads were pulled and re-sewn along the quilted pattern look. I really don\u2019t know what to say about this. I only noticed because I was trimming all the loose, dangling threads. From a regular distance away, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be noticeable. However\u2026 It looks cheaply put together and I tried to fix it the best I can to make it presentable as a christmas gift.If I had seen this exact jacket hanging in a store in this condition, I most definitely would not have purchased it unless it was deeply discounted.I have not noticed any holes though, and all zippers work as they should.I tried the coat on myself, it did feel warm and plush, the inside of the hood is very soft. I am hoping my grandma will like it.One positive, so I am not ending this on a bad note, shipping was faster than predicted.",

It looks like the needle didn\u2019t catch and the thread kept going, then it finally caught again and the sewer just kept going without addressing the problem. I can\u2019t just trim them off or it will all come undone. Also the fur on the hood looks nothing like the photos\u2026 It doesn\u2019t look fluffy, it looks flat and ratty. Also, instead of the fur being on the edge of the hood (like how it usually is), it\u2019s on a big weird \u201cflap\u201d that you have to try to flip back onto the rest of the hood juuuuust right and hope it somehow stays. No snaps or anything to help it stay in place, and heaven forbid the wind blows. Finally, the zipper is backwards (the pull is on the left like on men\u2019s wear).I usually like Jessica Simpson\u2019s clothes, but these parkas are JUNK. They\u2019re both so defective & poorly made that I had to return both. Soooo disappointed.",

The hood is fully lined in a soft fur and framed with a nice big hood with matching (different type) fur. Gold Hardware elevates the look. Inside is lined with a bit of leopard and pink piping. Pockets are deep. I like the drawstring waist and the way it graduates a bit longer in the back.Just make sure you size down by 1 size than what you normally buy. I always take a large in coats but after reading reviews (thanks guys) I ordered a medium and it is still a bit roomy but in a good way. The seller has amazing customer service so if you're on the fence just get it! Thank me later!",
