I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d, 128lbs, 36B It fits perfectly. Not too tight and not baggy (sloppy). I\u2019ve received many compliments on it.It is somewhat thin cotton material, but that works out fine for me, as I don\u2019t get hot while I\u2019m working. It wasn\u2019t stiff and uncomfortable like most of my other lab coats.It washed nicely and didn\u2019t require ironing.I would definitely recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I have been searching for a lab coat the last couple weeks and I'm so glad I tried this one. I tried Grey's Anatomy lab coats at first but they looked a bit too juvenile and hokey for my taste. I could instantly tell this was good quality when I pulled it out of the bag. The fabric is soft, much softer than anything else I have tried. I am 140lbs at 5'6\" and a small is perfect! The inside of the cuffs have a super cute print (don't worry, it's not visible from the outside) that add a really nice touch to set this apart from other average lab coats (in addition to the other pros this lab coat has already.) The fit is very flattering and looks really good overall!",
