                "reviewText": "My first purchase from this line. The faux suede texture is soft to touch, not worried of it ripping.The material is smooth. No teeth. Faux suede means many things. The coat is lined, same color fur.I purchased size Small. I wish I had purchased X-Small. it's not a deal breaker.My measurements, 5'5, 34/27/34, I don't own a scale. 120lbs ish, give or take.Length, it sets just above my knee. It's not cumbersome, it's a perfect length.The coat is sewn well. The main zipper is quality.I purchased Green. It's not emerald green. My eyes see Blue Spruce Pine. It has a shard of teal within it.The color is unique. I love it. The fur collar is easy on, easy off. The belt is a bit high for my liking.The fur collar is thick, lush, not too much, soft, no odor, lovely. The color is complimentary to the faux suede.I took off the belt The loop height is high up. The belt line doesn't offer a true fitted look. I put it back on, let it hang, so the belt loops aren't empty. This coat is Not for Cold Winter wear. Fall brisk days, Wear it, Yes.It's too lightweight to be considered a Winter Snow coat. It is a perfect coat for a Winter date night, in and out, it's not for walking in cold temps. I wore it day-time, I had to walk a mile. It was around 30 degrees. I froze my butt off.It's what I would call a car coat weight,slightly heavier, fur lining. It holds its shape well.What I do not like is the pockets. They are deep, but narrow to get your hand in.I fumble with my cell phone every time. My keys, it's a struggle to get them in and out of the pockets.Kinda bummed with the pockets. The pockets are zippered, dry skin, the zippers hurt.I went to TJ Max, I looked at all the brand name coats.99 % were simply thin, or copycat bubble puffy coats that Everyone wears, nope, No personality, I ignored the prices, not one coat appealed to me.I had been eyeing this coat for wks on Amaz.When I went to a local store, none could compare, I purchased this coat.I stare at it and smile. Something about this coat just makes me happy.It will wear well in the spring, minus the fur collar. Pleased with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The quality for the price was a nice surprise!I was expecting this coat to be thinner and more lightweight. It can handle a 40 degree day very nicely. I put it away once the temps hit the high 50's and low 60's in Spring, which was sad because the vibrant golden yellow lifted my spirits and stood out on a grey day. It has perfect finishing stitches and a super soft interior that feels nice when you put it on.The sleeves are lined but stitched down at the wrist, so it is not a hassle to get your arm through. The inside is a softer fabric that is colormatched exactly to the coat, so when you sling it over a chair or have it unzipped it looks fashionable and expensive.The fur on the collar is fun. I find it too hot and tight on my neck if I also have a scarf for my outfit and detach it on those days. It has matching buttons and elasticized hooks making is easy to put on or take off. Again, the buttons and fabric loops are color matched.I ordered the large and went through a Covid weight gain then loss. There is just enough give to handle some weight flux and the belt can cinch tighter if you lose weight. It was able to zip, without pulling, over my breasts and I am in the well endowed category. It was not tight but fitted on my curvy hips and \"just\" covered my rear when standing. (I am 5/6)The zippered pockets are deep enough for a large phone, car keys and lipstick, but you will break the line of the coat if you have all that in one pocket. (It will bulge out and you will lose fashion points.)It is dry clean only. I bought the golden color to cheer up my wintry day and people will spot you a mile away. It looks great with black, grey, brown and white. When I wore teal with it I couldn't walk anywhere without a compliment and people turning to look at me. It is a sharp look.This is one of my favorite clothing purchases of the year and I will be adding this coat in at least one more color.",

Le manteau est aussi tr\u00e8s bien sans fourrure . La couleur jaune est proche d'une jolie couleur moutarde pas d'un jaune vif. La ceinture est un peu longue mais je la repasse une deuxi\u00e8me fois autour de la boucle et elle tient bien . Je reste satisfaite de cet achat. Je vous le recommande",
