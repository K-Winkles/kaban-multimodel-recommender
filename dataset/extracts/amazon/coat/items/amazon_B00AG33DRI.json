                "reviewText": "Today was the first day that I was able to wear my jacket. I am a teacher, and every morning, for 50 minutes, I have to stand outside directing traffic and students. I live in southern Georgia, where it is either miserably hot, or miserably cold. I have had to stand on duty in 20-30 degree weather many, many times. For several years I have worn the same heavy, trench-style coat. It is very heavy, but not necessarily warm. So, I felt it was time to get something new/better.Today it was only 61-63 degrees during my traffic duty, but it was also very windy and drizzly. Basically, a miserable morning to be out guiding traffic! Despite the miserable morning, I stayed warm and dry, and I did not even have an umbrella.This jacket is SO very lightweight!! It is no heavier than a thin windbreaker. I am 5'2\", and this jacket comes down to just above/at my knees, which is PERFECT for standing on duty in inclement weather. It was just what I was looking for. It has a tailored cut--which comes in at the waist--giving the jacket a feminine style, not bulky. The outer side pockets are zippered, so they can be zipped when not in use and give a more streamlined appearance. There is also a really cool inner pocket on the left breast close to the main zipper. It came in handy today when I had to tuck some money away. I LOVE the cool thumb-hole inner sleeve. Basically, with or without gloves on, it prevents a draft from traveling up the sleeve of the jacket. This insert can easily be tucked inside the jacket when you don't want to use it. The hood didn't stay on my head like I wanted (it does not cinch with a drawstring), but today was a very windy day, so I do not consider that a negative. The jacket zips up very high to above my chin, which is going to be awesome as the temperature drops later in the year.Details: I bought a size XL in black. I followed the size chart. However, on two of the measurements I fell on the L size, but on one measurement I fell on the XL size. I always buy size M in t-shirts and blouses, but my hips are my largest measurement. So, I erred on the side of caution and bought the XL. It is not too big at all. It fits very well, but I know I will still have room to layer when the time comes. Despite being lightweight and thin, this is a warm jacket, so I am hoping not to have to layer very much anyway.I got several compliments today on my coat. Even though it seems to be a plain black jacket, something about it has flair and is very stylish.Bottom line: This is a great purchase, and for the first time ever, I am looking forward to chilly weather (that's saying a lot since I was born and raised in Florida!!). This jacket is $50 cheaper than buying it from the Columbia website. Great value, great jacket.",

(I'm 5'3\".) It is incredibly lightweight, but the warmest coat I've ever owned. The \"Omni Heat\" feature uses the heat your body generates to keep you warm - even without layering! In fact, I think I'm warmer when I don't layer. I wear it out walking my Siberian Huskies in the frigid Kansas Winters -- terrible winds and temps well below freezing. Windchills below zero. It has inner cuffs at the wrists to help lock out the wind, a nice, substantial zipper, and a hood that actually stays up! I did buy it twice - I like it that much! I wish Columbia would make gloves like this, then I'd be all set!",

                "reviewText": "I love it. I'm 5'5\", 117 lb, 34a-b, and the xs fits perfectly with enough room for a thick layer, even two, and still looks good. It falls about mid-thigh. It's so soft and comfortable. I like that it's actually not shiny (on the outside) (I got the Nocturnal). The hand things can be used, or not; the sleeves/cuffs look good either way. The hood is not adjustable but it doesn't matter; it stays on and is a good fit. I *am* exchanging for an exact replacement because of a verrry slight, almost invisible snagging on one sleeve. I could ignore it, but for the price, I want my coat absolutely perfect. Will update based on customer service and the quality of the new one that comes in. UPDATE: the replacement has already arrived. I looked it over very carefully, top to bottom and it is perfect. I'm thrilled with it. Update, one year later: still love it. It holds up well, is so comfortable and light. It's also flattering, which is saying a lot for a such an incredibly warm winter coat. Zero bulk and has a good shape. The zipper opening up from the bottom as well as the top is a great bonus. You *do* need a hat, as the hood won't stay on in the slightest breeze, but considering how fantastic this coat is in all other respects, I'll gladly do the hat.",

                "reviewText": "Joining the chorus of praise for this coat. It's featherweight-light with a good weight-to-warmth ratio, the (three) pockets are deep and the zippers and pulls solid, the sleeve cuffs block wind beautifully, and the Dark Seas color is a striking dark teal that offers a nice visual break from black outerwear. It also seems fairly true to size -- I wouldn't recommend sizing up unless you wear super-thick sweaters, or you're the type who likes to strategically layer in the cold. I also have long arms and broad shoulders for my height/frame, and this coat accommodated both really well without me having to think at all about coverage or mobility.I ended up returning because of my own finicky preferences for wearability/utility as a New Englander. There are no cinch cords/ties anywhere on this coat, and this hood seems to slip off easily without a hat on for some added bulk/friction. Fitwise, I'm a compact 5'5\"/135-140lbs and the size S (the correct size for me) falls about 6in above my knee. I tested it outside in 35F degree weather, and it kept all covered body parts comfortably warm and didn't seem like it would cause me to overheat. For that temp though, it just felt like too much coat for me. Personally, I prefer a shorter, more form-fitting coat for moderately cold temps (30-45F) and a thicker, more weatherproof parka with a more well-constructed hood for anything colder. Didn't hit the mark for me, but I think this might be perfect for folks who run cold (a good multi-season coat); those who run hot (you don't need much insulation but want coverage); or those who have more temperate winters.",
