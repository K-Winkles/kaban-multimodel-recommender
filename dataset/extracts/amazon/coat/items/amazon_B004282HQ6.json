                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fits just right for the right measurements!",
                "reviewText": "My typical Cherokee scrub size is XS, which is still roomy. I ordered S because I was going to share with a friend in a different class period. I'm 5'2, fit 120lb, 34-25-35. My friend is 5'6, fit, (upon assumption:) 140lb, 36-30-36.When it arrived, I really liked that it had the waist buttons on the back along with a slit on the bottom back; however, I don't like the buttons. The buttons look fine, but pushing them in and out of their holes is borderline decent. They don't easily slip through their holes, the stitching will grip around the button (so you'll have to break them either way), they feel a bit too thin/light/not heavy enough (but can be overlooked), and they aren't slick.The fabric compared to other lab coats and scrubs I am familiar with (same brand) was different. It was rougher, especially compared to my scrubs. You can feel and see the twills with ease. I'd say it's thicker than the scrub tops, so the roughness can be overlooked.Although I purchased a size bigger, I can say that it will fit you if you purchase according to your measurements. I still look good in it. It looked somewhat fitting on me, which was great. I'm actually thankful for getting it a bit bigger because it'd somewhat be awkward to sit down with your buttoned coat on and have protruding lumps of fabric sticking out from your abdominal region like fat rolls. The extra waist space allowed me to look more comfortable in my coat.I do have to complain that the sleeves are too long for me. I have to cuff them about 3 inches under my coat. My friend said that they fit well, but never told me how far it reached down her arm. I would consider trimming the sleeve circumference down by an inch if you have pretty frail arms (I don't, but it does look funny if you're thin-thin).If you are new to lab coats, they will feel baggy when you put them on, but sometimes it takes a look in the mirror to see how normal it fits on you. It does make my hip area look chunkier, but I don't really care since I'm not working to impress anyone. I haven't experienced whether it will hug/wrap your hips based on appropriate sizing, so I can't say much. The fabric and design has much to do with the chunky look because it's thicker, rough, likes to keep shape, there are midsection slits at the bottom of both sides, and it's a lab coat great for working.Overall, it's professionally pleasing, doesn't have anything major to complain about, and it's good quality material.I'll update next month or so with pictures and updates!UPDATE: January 23, 2016I'll take back my complaint about the buttons! The buttons and their button holes are now pretty easy to manoeuvre after the fourth wear. The buttons are really easy to unbutton when wearing, which is a plus. I will return a star now. (Five Stars Whooo!) I'll try to grab a photo with it, but it'll stay in the lab until class dissections are done. :)",

                "reviewText": "Because other reviewers claimed that this ran small, I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. Unfortunately, it was so large I was practically swimming in it. The seller was very professional and let me exchange it for my normal size, and it fits beautifully, with enough room for me to wear a thick sweater if needed. When it arrived, the sleeves were about two inches too long for me, but since I needed it for lab right away, I cuffed them for the time being. When I got the chance, I washed it and tried it on again to mark the sleeves for hemming, but they had shrunk in the wash to where they fit perfectly now. I was lucky, but if the sleeves fit well when you get it, don't put it in the dryer! As far as I can tell, it was just the sleeves that shrunk, but I'm surprised that this kind of poly/cotton blend would shrink at all. At first, I was a little thrown off at the lack of upper pockets, but now that I've gotten used to the doubled lower pockets, I prefer them. Before, I couldn't bend down without risking everything spilling out of my upper pockets ( I don't think men have the same problem...), but now everything stays where I put them with even more places to stash things (as if I needed to be more of a pocket pack-rat). Overall, it is a very flattering lab coat, with a professional-looking collar and tabs in the back to pull it in slightly at the waist. The material is also nice and heavy, unlike many other lab coats that are nearly see-through. This is a very nice piece of protective gear for the lab that I will continue to use for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "As a new doc, you really anticipate the moment when your lab coat transitions from \"short\" student coat to the \"long\" version. I needed something that would be considered long without swallowing me whole, as I'm very petite, only 5'2\" and just over 100 lbs. This coat is just short of perfect. I love the princess seams and the flattering cut and details.It has buttons that allow you to cinch in the back slightly for a more hourglass shape which is great, but there are NO pockets on the inside of the coat or slit pockets to let you reach through the coat to allow you to get into pants pockets easily. My other larger unisex coat had both of those things but swallows me whole. There is also no breast pocket on this coat which makes it easy to embroider but may be a pain for those people who are used to sticking pens on that left chest pocket.I love that this coat is adjustable and more flattering, but I miss the extra pockets. The pockets that it does have are really functional, fitting a full size iPad while also having separate pen pockets with 3 separate pocket compartments. The fabric is very durable and a bit thicker than other lab coats and not as flimsy, but this can be a little warmer as a result. Great if your clinics are cold like mine, problematic if they run warm.Add some extra inside pockets, get that fifth star Cherokee!",
