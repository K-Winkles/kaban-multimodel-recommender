                "reviewText": "This is the perfect coat for COLD weather! I was looking for something that would keep me warm walking my dog in the sub-freezing weather we've been having--he has a nice warm puffer dog coat so I chose this one for me and I'm glad I did. It fits well, not too loose and not too tight--I could layer under it but I don't need to. Just took a mile walk in 0 degrees with only a t-shirt and jeans under this coat and I was toasty warm the whole way. The zipper feels strong and serviceable, the coat material feels light but durable, not slick or easily snagged, and the \"fur\" around the hood looks ok. I wanted a warm coat long enough to keep me warm from head to thighs and this one is just what I wanted.",

                "reviewText": "For the price point this is a well made coat that performs well. It's keeping me toasty warm in the mid-west winter. I love that the hood is detachable since I prefer hats, but I also am glad it's an option if I want to use it. I love the cuffed sleeves. I have trouble finding coats that have long enough sleeves. These hit just right and the cuff keeps the cold out and fits nicely over gloves. The longer length is perfect. I have a long torso and I, again, have trouble finding coats that are a good length. This is long enough to keep you really warm, keep out the draft, but it's not hard to sit in or get in and out of a car it. While the neck zips up high, the fit at the neck is sort of loose, so on windy days you may want a scarf, but this is not a big issue for me. I am 5 foot 9 inches and weigh about 145 pounds and I got the large. I am glad I did, but I would not mind if it was a bit more snug fit around the waist. But I think a medium would be too small. It's thick without being bulky. It does well in wind and I've been out in snow and single digits in it and it did great for me. I hate cold weather but this has made walking the dogs so much less awful. I also like the multiple pockets - 4 outer ones on the front. I put my phone in a top one so they lower ones are free for my hands. They are nice and deep and a great extra layer when gloves are not quite enough. I liked mine so much I recommended the brand to my son and he got one of the men's coats and he loves it as well. Overall it's a great buy that performs well and it has a great profile that looks good on. Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This coat is attractive and fits well. I had concerns that it would be too heavy and boxy but it is not. It's a medium weight, not too stiff material. The color is a bluish grey. I wanted a coat that would be a happy medium between a long jacket and a coat that's just above my knees (I'm 5\"7,) and this coat meets that requirement. I also found it to be very warm. The one thing I don't like about it is the fur around the hood. It looks ratty and sparse, not befitting such a nice coat, so I unzipped and removed it. If I could make one suggestion to the manufacturer, it would be that they should consider providing a more attractive piece of faux fur or eliminate that part altogether.",

                "reviewText": "The Good:* The teal color is really pretty.* The coat is really warm. I bet it would keep me toasty in 15\u00b0 weather.* The XXL fit across my chest. I wear a 40H bra, And it's very difficult to find a coat that doesn't make me look and feel like a sausage.* I'm 5'9, and I have a regular length torso. The coat hits just below my butt. I wish it was a couple inches longer but it's fine.* The construction is mostly good.The Not-So-Good:* The hood is a big negative. I like the fur look, but this faux fur looks incredibly cheap and feels worse. I tried to comb it out a little when I got it. That made no difference. I am sensitive to textures. I cannot handle touching this stuff. Gross.* Yes, the fur comes off. You unzip it. But I think this function is so you can wash it at home. Without the fur, the hood becomes quite shallow. I don't think it would work at all without the fur.* As you can see in the picture, The hood is a fashion statement only. There is no way that I could find to tighten it around my face. That means any breeze is going to wrap around your face and push the hood off your head.* The fabric gets dirty very quickly. I wore this to run one quick errand, brushed against my car, and spent some time scrubbing (not wiping) to get that little bit of dirt off the fabric. Not good.* I like that the cuffs have extra fabric at the opening, but at least on the jacket I got it does not have enough elastic to stay tight around my wrist. The purpose of this is to keep wind and snow from getting up your sleeves. Those cuffs would fail at the at their job.* The main pockets have snaps, not zippers. I know for sure that I would lose my keys, my phone, my sunglasses, anything I put in those pockets except for the receipts I need to throw away anyway.* The coat is quite heavy.I decided to go with a lightweight Columbia jacket instead, and I'm returning this. Bummer.",
