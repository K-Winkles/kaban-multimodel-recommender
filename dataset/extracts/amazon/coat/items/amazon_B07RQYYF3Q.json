                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First, this is a beautiful jacket. I have the longer one though I had so much trouble deciding between the two, I may buy the shorter one in a different color if this proves to be warm enough for Michigan winters. The herringbone pattern of the puffs seems to be unique to this coat at this time and is one of the most flattering \"v shaped\" silhouettes one could wish for - especially in a winter coat. A puffer, no less! I do not like the look of most puffer jackets. The puffs all go straight across which makes your body look wider. Not this coat~! The gorgeous cascading v cuts your figure even if you aren't \"cut\". My body shape in this coat resembles (a much larger) Marilyn Monroe hourglass shape. I'm still losing weight (fasting and keto) and will probably buy smaller sizes if they keep selling these.Sizing: Amazon suggested a 3x for me, which is not available and would have been too large. My current measurements are 48\"-44\"-50\" and the seller recommended which fits perfectly:Size: XX-Large | Color: \uff08runs Large. Order Size Down) Ink Blue(shiny)-avg.36\" Long LengthThe sleeves are very, very long. I have shorter arms and need blocks in yoga for some poses, too, though. I also don't always wear gloves, so really appreciate the longer sleeves. They can be pushed up a bit a la '80's or even rolled up.The hood is delightful. It truly blocks the wind and I was able to pull it over my ears and go without my constant ear muffs. Huge plus! It also is very light and doesn't get behind your neck or bother you when it's down.Quality on this is outstanding. This is one of the best zippers I've seen on a coat. It has no hanging threads or threats of coming apart any time soon! Again, the style is just fantastic, too! It would be nice if the pockets were fully lined for they are a bit rough on one side, but that's nitpicking! Compare the price of this coat to others in its class with far inferior styling and you'll have it in your cart before you know it!I will update this to address warmth as the season changes. I know people always say that and don't, but I do. lol Hope this helps!Lightweight. Extremely lightweight. I'm kind of skeptical that it will keep me warm during a Michigan winter, but like a review from Minnesota, we shall see and even if it's only for Fall and Spring, it's a beautiful jacket. I will not return it. I am hoping the technology mentioned works. I use an NIR light therapy and it's magical, so I am very hopeful.Update: this cost has been surprisingly warm during 20 below zero 50 mph winds. I won\u2019t say it encouraged me to camp in the backyard, but going from house to car and running my dog in the backyard was doable! Whatever this technology is, it\u2019s amazing because you can wear this inside the store and also not get hot. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s warm enough to walk to school, etc outside longer than like 10-15 minutes, but it\u2019s performing better than I expected.2nd Update: My measurements are now basically 45\" - 39\"- 45\" - this coat still fits when I roll the sleeves a bit and it's very roomy. I'm going to buy another one in either Teal or Olive and thinking about the shorter style for the new coat. Looks like the sizing will be different for Olive than Teal. This Ink Blue is a terrific color and still looks and functions fantastically after almost 1 yr. Excellent wind blocking capabilities!",

So, I will be returning I guess for an XXL or time to hit the gym. Possibly ordering a different coat.The coat I did receive is very warm in cooler weather. I have worn it in feels like Temps of 20 degrees with wind chills and very light snow so far just to see if the coat was warm. Stepped outside the house. Coat kept me warm and toasty. I do wish that the coat had a cloth lining which I thought it did when I ordered. The hood is a good size, not too big not too small and didn't blow off in the big winds we had. It's just ok. Kind of thin and very light weight and soft. But I will be returning and ordering a different coat. I really need a lining inside the coat, hood and pockets.",

Makes a great warm raincoat, but not a great cold protector. I am keeping it because it fits as an in between jacket which I did not have.",
