                "reviewText": "We got this jacket to replace a different one my daughter lost at school. She picked this one out because of the pastel rainbow color. This is a lightweight coat, so I gave it 4 stars for warmth. It is cozy and works well in the winter temperatures we typically get in the south. My daughter usually fits kids size 6, and this 6/7 fit her very well, with a little room to grow. She was thrilled at the hot pink lining color! There are two inner and two outer pockets, not zipper closure. The ends of the sleeves are fitted with elastic, and fits about at her wrists. The hood is a good size, covering her head and ears, but not hanging down over her eyes or face. She is 3' 8\" tall, and the length falls well below her hips. The jacket feels and looks very well made, with quality materials and durable stitching. We are very happy with this jacket.",

                "reviewText": "Received the jacket today for my 8 year old granddaughter and tried it on immediately. Very tight fit and would not be able to zip if she had on a sweater or sweatshirt underneath. I had read several reviews that said it ran small but decided a large would be safe for an 8 year old. She is wearing 10 if individually sized but I do buy 10/12 if that sizing is available. Usually works fine but this time it didn't. The quality seemed nice and is exactly what I was looking for for our usually mild North Carolina winters. Have started my return an exchange for an X Large. If a little big that's OK so we can possibly get longer use out of it. Saw some comments on quality but keep in mind this is a $20 item not an Eddie Bauer packable down jacket for a lot more $$$$$ As a reference my granddaughter is 67.6 lbs and 4ft 3-1/4 inches tall and this jacket was definitely too small. Arm length ok but tight across shoulders .",
