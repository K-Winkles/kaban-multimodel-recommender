I actually ordered this for a High School assembly costume to help out with a particular class's student cheers so they could win the \"school spirit\" stick/award (which they did win). Many of the STEM teachers were commenting on how well constructed it was when they saw it up close as I walked the halls that day, and the price is excellent to boot. Mine ran a bit bigger than expected but it was also a rush job in ordering it since time was critical in getting it - I have to get 3X in Ts and hoodies if made in China since most articles mfg'd there run smaller. If I were actually using it in a lab (chemistry, etc) I'd personally go down at least one size as the arms were a bit big (and too long) for me and would likely cause more problems than protect me from.I like this lab coat a lot and will be using it more in the future when I can.",
