My first day out with it for ski club was windy and wet snow. This coat kept me dry and very comfortable. Also, the number, placement and size of the pockets are great and the color pictured is very accurate.",

It fit nicely otherwise but I wouldn\u2019t be able to wear layers. Since I didn\u2019t need the jacket for any activity other than walking the dog, I returned it and got a size medium. It fit perfectly. It is super warm!! I don\u2019t need to wear a scarf bc the zipper goes all the way up and covers my neck completely. The hood is a little big and when I put it up and Velcro it, it covers my mouth. But honestly I I don\u2019t mind that bc it helps keep me warm. Wearing a hat and the hood is perfect. I love that it has a bunch of pockets too! Definitely happy with my purchase.",

It keeps me nice and toasty without making me overheat. I happened to be going out, so I wore it. Gives me plenty of room to walk around. Highly recommended! Perfect for cold NJ winters! Haven't tried the hood yet as it was still 'packed' inside the jacket. I'll have to try it with the hood and give an update.",

When I added a sweater under it, it became too tight and restricted my movement. I'm 5'7 with an average length torso and prefer my jackets to come at least down to the middle of my butt, this came to the top of my jeans.",
