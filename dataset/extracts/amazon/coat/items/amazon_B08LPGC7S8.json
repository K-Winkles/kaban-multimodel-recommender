The stitching and cut of the coat look more expensive than it is. It\u2019s not wool, but has that appearance.I\u2019m 5\u20193 and 128 lbs, and the small fit perfectly. It\u2019s warmer than I expected-I\u2019ve been wearing it for errands in about 25-35* F weather and it\u2019s been warm enough for the walks to and from the car. It upgrades my outfits, and it\u2019s light enough that I don\u2019t have to take it off indoors. Definitely recommend!",

The material feels like a high-quality grade of fabric. It has nicely tailored lines, so it complemented my daughter\u2019s figure. The sizing was accurate, so it fit perfectly.Overall, we are exceptionally pleased with this garment. It looks like a coat that cost much more than what we paid. Definitely two thumbs up.",

The arms were long enough which is a plus for a tall girl. It hits slightly longer than mid thigh. It\u2019s not a terribly warm coat but would be fine for cool weather. I happened to receive mine during a cold snap when it was in the 20s and it 100% didn\u2019t do much to keep me warm. In the 40s/50s it was great. The coat LOOKS good and gives the aesthetic that I was looking for. I definitely think it\u2019s worth it for the price, which was great.",

                "reviewText": "Full disclosure, this coat is 100% polyester and not wool blend, BUT you can\u2019t tell by looking at it. I have never received so many compliments on an article of clothing as this coat (I got it in the cream color). It\u2019s fitted nicely as it comes in a little in the middle so it isn\u2019t boxy, even on me and I am boxy. I am outdoors for most of my shifts at work and even when it\u2019s in the low 50s I\u2019m warm and cozy in my coat. Last night I just bought this in two more colors.TLDR; The coat is beautiful, warm, and the price can\u2019t be beat. It does arrive folded with creases so you\u2019ll have to take it to the dry cleaners before wearing.",

The style is very nice, the proportions are wonderful, the pockets reasonably deep, and the sleeves slightly longer than expected; a bonus, better too long than too short. Since it is 100% Polyester (says the tag), it isn't very warm for the dead of winter, but it does the job, very nice appearance, and the workmanship of the construction is industry standard, and well executed. For the price, fantastic.",
