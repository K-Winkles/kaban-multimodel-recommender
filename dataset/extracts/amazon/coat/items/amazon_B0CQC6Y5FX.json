The only downside to this is that I wanted the jacket to feel more casual; however, the jacket has some shoulder pads that cause it to fit a little more formally. Nothing that a few months of regular wear can't take care of - haha! I'm 6'1, 275lbs, wear 38/40 waist pants and the XXL fit really nicely. This will be in my regular rotation for business casual wear.",

This had a 43\"+ chest for medium, also, which I never would have matched up. The size chart was spot on! First jacket that has ever fit me perfectly \"off the rack\". I would give 5 stars, but the fabric is a little more shiny than I prefer, but not so much I will not wear it a bit. Perfect with a t shirt and pair of jeans!
