The fabric is nice quality even though it\u2019s not 100% wool it looks great and is soft. I am hopeful the fabric will hold up to years of wear. There is not a lot of difference between the small and the medium, except for the sleeve length. It is small through the shoulders and arms, but fits well for me in both the small size and medium. I am 5ft 4 110 pounds and the small is a comfortable fit, but the sleeves are just a little bit short for me. The length of this coat is perfect for cold winter weather. Excellent coat for the money.",

If you like extra room for wearing something heavier than a blouse, you may need a larger size. It is made of quality materials and manufactured quite nicely.

                "reviewText": "When I lifted the coat out of the shipping bag, I knew at once it would be perfect for the mountain winter climate. It was really heavy, akin to far more expensive coats. The lining is quilted and thick. It\u2019s perfect for winter weather. The style is very traditional- double breasted with a belted back. The size was snug when I wore the coat over a wool sweater. I\u2019m size 8 and the coat was size medium. The only point of concern is that there are no fabric content labels and I\u2019m not really sure there is much actual wool in the coat. Still, I\u2019m keeping it for the warmth.",

                "reviewText": "Feels like 100% wool. Good weight and perfect for a dress coat. I was hoping it would be a bit longer, but it did hit right below my knee. You really can't beat the price for this coat. I read all the reviews and figured I would take a chance on this item. I'm so glad I did. I purchased the large and I am 5' 9\", 148 lbs. It's not fitted, but looks good over dressy clothes and is not too tight to wear a bulky sweater underneath.",

                "reviewText": "Very well made and cute coat. I love the army green color---different from the ordinary gray/black/beige choices. I have had compliments. Looks great with dresses or jeans. Nice and warm. I wear a size 18 and got XXL. It fits okay for me---I rarely button my coat--- but the top button is a bit tight when buttoned. The fabric looks and feels like wool but it is polyester which is perfect for me because I am allergic to wool!",

This coat fit me perfectly, as well as kept me warm in freezing NYC temperatures! I wasn\u2019t particularly gentle with this coat, but I\u2019m happy to say it\u2019s extremely anti-wrinkle/crease which was such a relief. Also the pockets are some of the deepest ever so there were some times where I didn\u2019t even need my purse haha highly recommend this!",
