True to size ordered 2X size, but was too big, however, good if you want to still layer and for bigger people. Will keep you super warm only issue is sleeves are longer due to larger sizing, so keep that in mind, if you are shorter in height. Also long in length so no worries about butt or legs getting frozen. Thank you!",

I have a puffer jacket that is really warm, and I wanted the same in a full-length coat. I walk my dog every morning, and it can be very cold because we have windy weather that makes cold feel even colder. It takes a really good coat to stop the wind from penetrating the outer layer of protection.This coat is very well made and it fits perfectly. I love that it has a two-way zipper so that it can e zipped up from the bottom to allow you to sit more comfortably. It\u2019s a good weight. Not too heavy, but definitely heavy enough to be warm. A plus is that it is a pretty colorand is a nice material. I love this coat!!",

I originally wanted a 2X because I wanted a roomy coat that I could wear with sweaters, sweats, etc. But I ended up going smaller with an XL. Even with that it's a bit bigger than anticipated. But that's the only issue. It's warm, comfortable and attractive. I highly recommend it, just go with 2 sizes smaller than you normally would.",

I love the detailed stiching at the wrists, the elastic synching on the back, the snaps on the bottom of the back, the zipper that zips from the top and from the bottom, the deep pockets with zippers, and the length of the coat. The size of the hood is perfect and doesn't fall in my face. It's a warm coat, but not too heavy or bulky. It's a great, stylish winter coat. Just what I was looking for.",

                "reviewText": "I live in MN and needed a long coat to keep me warm in the long and cold winters. I personally think this coat runs a little large. I originally ordered a large, knowing I wanted to be able to wear bulky sweaters and sweatshirts underneath. The large was quite large and allowed too much air to flow up and into the coat. I returned the large and ordered a MEDIUM and it fits perfectly. Fitted in the chest, but not too tight, and the cinching on the back of the coat provides a nice fitted look. With the coat being really long, just about at my ankles, I like that the zipper unzips from the bottom to make it easier getting in and out of vehicles.My measurements are: 38DD and typically a size large in clothing",

I work outside alot and I can be rough on coats,so perfect deal !",
