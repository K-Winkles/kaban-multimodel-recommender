However, the X-Large has a little longer sleeves which are so perfect in a cold climate. They slightly cover your gloves, totally blocking the wind. Additionally, with the X-Large you can wear your bulkiest hoodie and still button the coat. Or, you can leave it unbuttoned and just rap the extra cloth to your left, having more warmth in your front. Or, let it hang loose when you\u2019re shopping in warm stores. This is my very favorite coat and the pink is such a happy color! Someone else with an X-Large said she would move the 2 buttons over. Good idea if you want a fitted look, however, I\u2019ll leave my buttons where they are making the coat more versatile.",

                "reviewText": "The fit is a bit odd, but I think it\u2019s cut to be straight and either worn big or on someone who isn\u2019t super curvy. Just know that the fabric adds volume but also warmth. I am 5 months post partum so I want to feel cute, warm, and not pregnant. This ticks those boxes except when I button the bottom button I feel like the coat is a little small on my hips. That\u2019s consistent with my current sizing, which is about a 14/32 in jeans, and 36DDD/large busty in bras. I hope not to stay this size by next winter so ideally this is a fun, one winter coat for me, then I will donate it. I bought this coat on Cyber Monday and feel happy keeping the coat at that price.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this coat. The hot pink color is vibrant and gorgeous. The coat is nice quality with a satiny lining. Amazon recommended I order a L. I ordered an XL first (that's the photo with the dim lighting). It was plenty roomy in the chest and shoulders, but snug in the belly and hips when buttoned (full disclosure, I had a baby 6 months ago, but I don't think I'm THAT disproportionate) . I returned it and sized up to an XXL (the 3 brighter pics). The fit was still ridiculous. I had enough room in the hips now, but it was huge up top and the sleeves were about 4 in too long. Bottom line, if you're a curvy girl, this coat would be awesome if you didn't plan to button it. If you live in a cold climate and want a functional winter coat, I'd sadly suggest you look elsewhere.",

The tag says machine wash tumble dry low. Will update after washing.",
