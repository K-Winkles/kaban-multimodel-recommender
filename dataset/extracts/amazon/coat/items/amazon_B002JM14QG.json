                "reviewText": "I ordered one to see how it fit and the quality before I order more for work. Everyone was saying they run big so I wasn't sure what size to get. I normally wear an XL so that's what I ordered since I plan on wearing a t-shirt underneath to absorb the sweat (it gets hot in a kitchen). I tried it on and it fit very well in fact, not too big by any means. I could've gone with a large but it would have been more snug and I don't like clothing to be tight or restrictive. I'm 6'3\" tall and weigh around 230#. I have big arms but there is plenty of room in the shoulders and upper arm area. It's plenty long enough and looks very professional. The material reminded me of a karate uniform so hopefully it will last a long time. I can't wait to get my name embroidered on it. Overall it's a very nice coat for a great price. There are other cheaper coats but remember you get what you pay for. I'm going to recommend this to the rest of the cooks. I will be buying several more for myself.",
