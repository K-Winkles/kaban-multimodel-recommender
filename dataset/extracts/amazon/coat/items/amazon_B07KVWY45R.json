When arms are rested, the sleeves land past my wrist and at the top portion of my hand. It is a great length. I'm 5'8\" with a short torso and very long legs, and the hemline lands at my knee. It is very fitted on me, but I do have room for a heavier sweater or hoodie underneath. I'm 38\" bust and 30-32\" waist and 34\" hip? or close. I'm about 145 lbs now and still should be fine if I gain 5 lbs winter-weight :). I have slender legs but muscular. It is well made and heavy/warm, but not too heavy. It is lined nicely. I'm very pleased with the coat and the price I paid for it. Overall, it is a nice, classy-looking black peacoat!",

Pockets are good and roomy, some reviews mentioned they were too high on the jacket but for me they were fine, Im 5\u20196. Length just above the knee. Arms were longer but i liked that. Went just over my wrist onto my hand. The middle is not fitted. Price was right since I only wear for special occasions or nice dinners. Simple yet timeless style (IMO)",

                "reviewText": "It is a very nice coat. It is not bulky. I failed to notice that the pockets are not at a slant, so you can't really use them or they will pull out of shape. It fits a little loosely through the waist and chest, but that turns out to be not so bad when wearing a sweater underneath. That does, though, mean that the inside button that keeps the coat \"snug\" falls out when you are not wearing something heavier underneath. Overall, if I had it to do again, I'd buy another one. The price is right and the problems minor.",

                "reviewText": "(This is an honest review. I purchased the coat and I am not paid for this review.) This coat is very well made, has an excellent fit (2X) and is perfect for Southern California winters! I would tell people to order larger than your normal fit (because people wear bulky clothes in the winter). The 2X size is perfect for me, and I like my clothes loose. It fits snugly but NOT too tight, and that will make it warmer when I have to wait hours for the bus, keeping the body heat inside the coat. I would tell people to ignore the bad reviews - they must have received defective product. The coat is VERY well made, has good stitching, the sleeves are long, and the buttonholes are fine (just be careful when unbuttoning, as people should do anyway). I am looking forward to wearing this coat throughout the Southern California winter (which is milder than Boston/New York winters - we have lived on all those areas). Very, very pleased with this coat!",
