I love the color and all the zip pockets. I did size up one size based on other reviews and the fit is great. Considering I will be wearing layers underneath, it's fine for it to be slightly big. Would definitely recommend!",

I haven't tested it below 32 Deg F yet, but it's great quality for the price and I'll get plenty of wear out of it this winter. As far as fit, I'm plus size and ordered the 2x. It is not fitted, rather more boxy but comfortable.",

There\u2019s a small zippered interior pocket and two outside zippered pockets. The outside pockets are deep, so they can easily hold my keys, phone, gloves, and hat. I haven\u2019t needed to wear a hat because the hood is SO WARM! It\u2019s so soft, and I love that it has its own buttons to keep my nose and below warm. It\u2019s also detachable. The cuffs are velco adjustable so I can make them tighter to stop wind and precipitation from coming in. Th bottom has a drawstring to also keep the wind out. The color is gorgeous. I\u2019m 5\u20192 and weigh 160lbs. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly! I can wear heavy shirts underneath and have plenty of movement.",

The pockets are roomy enough to accommodate my dog's longline leash when we go out in the woods and a treat bag in the other pocket. Plus it has a left inside zipper pocket easy to access for a phone or wallet. I ordered the purple and it is a darkish purple so it doesn't stand out too much which I like. Seems like a wine color.",
