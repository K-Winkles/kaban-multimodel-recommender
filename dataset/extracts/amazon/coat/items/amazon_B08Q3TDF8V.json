I\u2019ve had it a year, worn for 5-6 months. A button on the side has fallen off, both pockets have come undone on the sides, there is a hole in the bottom of one side pockets so large my phone falls through it, so I don\u2019t use that pocket anymore. I\u2019ve been meaning to stitch these back up, but I\u2019m not much of a mender, so I\u2019ve not gotten around to it. If it was better constructed, I would give this coat 10/5 stars, I just wish it would last me longer than 1.5 winters.",
