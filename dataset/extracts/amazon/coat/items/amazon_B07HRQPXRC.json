                "reviewText": "This is a great coat. I had originally purchased the coat in a dark gray and without the pockets and buttons. It was soft, comfy and fit well (I ordered a medium) but I felt it looked a bit like a robe/sweater bc it didn't have pockets and/or buttons. I ended up returning it bc I had second thoughts on the color and the style. Additionally it did shed a bit as I took it out of the package and tried it on. I had read previous reviews of that happening to other customers and that it had stopping shedding after it was washed, but since I returned that coat I can't comment if that would of worked for me.But I did reorder the coat, this time in Camel and with the pocket and buttons and I LOVE IT!!! It is still soft and fuzzy and does keep me warm. I did not have the same problem with any shedding with this coat as I did with the previous one I ordered. I also prefer the style with the pockets and buttons bc it give a \"coat effect\" vs the style without the pockets giving it a \"sweater or robe\" effect. But that is my preference. Both options are great, I just preferred the camel color and pocket style better.The only thing I didn't like is that it came in a clear vacuumed-sealed back for all to see what I ordered. This has been happening a lot more lately on purchases I have made with Amazon. I understand it could be more cost effective and better for the climate/environment but would be great if the bags were not clear with your order on full display. Maybe a package that is opaque so its less transparent when delivered.",

                "reviewText": "After receiving this jacket I would say that the pictures in the reviews are quite accurate, versus the product photos. I wanted casual, but this was way too casual for me. It literally looks like an old bath robe. It\u2019s thick and warm and decent quality, though, so if you want a super comfy lounge coat, you\u2019ll love it. The reviews were mixed so I sized up to an XL but I think a L might have been better because the shoulders were too wide in the XL and made it look sloppy.",

                "reviewText": "I love the look and feel of this coat. Based on some reviews I got the sense coat was oversized so I ordered a Small and I should have ordered a Medium. I wear it with a scarf draping down the front so no one would know the difference. I did wash before wearing as some recommended to get rid of excess fluff. Quality is good and well made so no problem with hem as some mentioned. Overall I would buy it again and some of my friends have bought already after seeing mine. Order size you normally wear not a size smaller or larger. I so wish I had of ordered a Medium like I normally wear. I've had many compliments and it's very fashionable.",
