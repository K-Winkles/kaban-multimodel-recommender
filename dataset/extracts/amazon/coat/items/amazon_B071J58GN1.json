I don't know why it makes me feel so official, but it does. This coat. Fits really well, super durable. I actually stayed mostly clean. I bought this for Christmas. There a lot of holiday cooking to be done. I I wanted to get dressed and stay dressed and I needed something that was more than an apron to cover my clothes. I was so happy when this came. And the fit was perfect. I definitely would say buying this made me feel like Gordon Ramsay.",

SAME. SIZE. I know they\u2019re the exact same because I\u2019ve bought this THREE TIMES NOW due to them all being the WRONG SIZE. I suppose I need an extra extra extra small because it still doesn\u2019t fit, which, well - fine. I\u2019ll accept it.But two different sizes should not be the EXACT SAME??I can\u2019t even return them because of this coronavirus BS, so I wasted a bunch of money for no reason.I hate this product.",
