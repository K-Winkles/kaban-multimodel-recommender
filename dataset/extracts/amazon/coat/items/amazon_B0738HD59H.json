We picked this out as a compromise as he was going skiing and the forecast was 20 degrees. Seemed the perfect thickness and weight. Ordered an XL thinking 12/14. Nope this thing was tiny! Tag stated xl but looked more like a 7/8. I really wish the sizing wasn\u2019t so off bc it would have been the perfect coat. Luckily I was able to send back and get a full refund.",

I don't typically buy boys clothes, but have had good luck with a few items, so thought I would take a chance on this puffy jacket as the color I chose was being sold at a discount ($27). The overall length and sleeves are long on me, so the fit is like a parka, more functional than stylish. I choose the XXL size which is correct as the XL would likely be too narrow in the hip. Inside, the material is smooth, and the seams are well-finished. The outside hand warmer pockets are nice and deep, the inside pockets are large and a great addition. The cuffs and hood are loose-fitting with almost no elastic stretch, it could use a drawstring closure, but that's not included. Except for a raincoat, I don't have another favorite jacket in my closet, so for now this will likely become my primary jacket during the winter and my go-to jacket when I travel.",

It is not a big thick puffy jacket where he has a hard time moving around and he easily fits in his car seat with this jacket on. The sizing chart was spot on so was nice to order a jacket and come in and have it fit as it said it would. Definitely would buy it again great value for the price.",
