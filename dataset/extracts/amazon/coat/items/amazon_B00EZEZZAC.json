                "reviewText": "Gave away my business casual lightly insulated jacket to some homeless kid when I was on a walk downtown with my wife last year - and felt good about myself until I realized how hard it was to replace that jacket :)! So this year as fall hit, I was looking for a ~200$ HH or Kuhl lightly insulated jacket but I had no luck finding anything I liked in an LT size. After hours of comparison shopping I found this one on Amazon. It was priced lower than I preferred as I wanted a business casual coat that I would feel good wearing at the office and I wanted something that looked expensive. I have never heard of Weatherproof but they trumpet their 'since 1949'. Strangely for a company so proud of the brand they didn't have a single logo anywhere visible on the outside of the coat, just the tags inside the coat. OK - whatever. The coat itself fits absolutely perfectly and looks great. The first order was hilarious as I am an LT and Amazon sent me a 4XLT so when I put it on I looked like I was in a tent. Amazon issue not the coats - and amazon processed the return and had me a replacement in 3 days so it was all good. So I am 6'4' 230 with broad shoulders, long arms. 36' waist. This LT size is form fit for those dimensions. I typically have trouble with too short arms and too short a waist and occasionally too big a waist on the coat. This coat had none of these issues and just fits. All zippers work and the seams are well sown. Velcro sleeves aren't too bulky. I like the material for the outside and it just feels sturdy. The insulation was much better than expected and I wore it in 35F weather this week and while I won't say I was toasty I was OK. I would want to \"layer up\" colder than 35F for sure. The wife says it looks slimming and I feel good wearing it. So I feel like I met my goals of expensive look and feel, perfect fit, (bonus - decent insulation without bulk). I did not get any of the brand names I was after but I paid less than 1/2 my budget so I'll get over it. Highly recommended - I would get another in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewText": "This ended up being exactly what I was hoping for!Quality is great. The fit is perfect too. I bought a medium and it fits perfectly. It\u2019s a mid-weight jacket just as the description states. Perfect for a fall/spring weather outer layer. Though it is warm enough to be paired with a hoodie underneath and used during the winter. The inside is fleece lined and soft. The exterior is a nylon type water resistant material. Really nice quality and gives the jacket a very clean and crisp look. Which means it\u2019s also a great option for more formal situations as well. It\u2019s a great all-rounder.This will be my new go-to for any situation that doesn\u2019t require a full on bulky winter coat. I\u2019ll most likely reach for this during the winter when heading to work as well. It\u2019s warm enough for short walks to and from the car. I can\u2019t think of any reasons I wouldn\u2019t wear this, other than needing a hood, or when I need a full-on winter coat. New #1 coat.The only criticism I could offer is that it did take a full 2 weeks to receive mine. My order wasn\u2019t processed and shipped for probably 3-4 days after I ordered. Then it took another 2-3 to arrive, only to find out they sent me a small. I exchanged it for a medium no problem, but that order took another 4-5 days to ship out, and another 3-4 to arrive. Finally received the correct medium exactly 2 weeks after ordering. Both items shipped USPS which probably didn\u2019t help anything. A little frustrating when you\u2019re used to 2 day shipping on everything. But not the end of the world. Just something to keep in mind.",

                "reviewText": "Good quality jacket at a very reasonable price. Very comfortable and looks very nice for the price. A medium weight, rain-resistant jacket as advertised, perfect for fall, winter and spring here on the mild Central Coast of California. As other reviewers have noted, the sleeves are unusually long on the Medium jacket, which is odd because the torso is not long at all. But by adjusting the velcro at the sleeves you can prevent the sleeves from covering your hands. Other than that, it's a perfect jacket. My wife bought a jacket from this manufacturer years ago, and it still looks like it's new after heavy use, so I expect the same for this one.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this coat. I bought my first one 8 years ago and it's been one of my favorites for so many different weather conditions and temperatures. It's warm enough to wear in the middle of winter with just a long sleeve t-shirt underneath but I can also wear it during the spring or fall and not get too hot. It's very well made and holds up to wind and rain. I love all the pockets that zip up and have tons of room for gloves, keys, plus my cellphone fits perfectly in the chest pocket and the hidden inside pockets are also fantastic for some extra things if you need the room. The only reason I got a 2nd jacket was the zipper on my first one started to fray at the bottom from constant use throughout the cold months plus I've put it through the wash a few times and when I tried to have the zipper replaced the local tailors here in Manhattan wanted to charge me more than the cost of a brand new coat so sadly I just decided to buy a new one but otherwise my original coat was still in perfect condition except for the front zipper....but a coat like this that holds up perfectly for 8 years is an AMAZING VALUE so I was totally happy to buy a 2nd one and I would buy it again in the future if I need to. It's very stylish as well and I can wear it to a number of different outings or events and dress it up or down. This is truly one of the best and most versatile coats I've ever owned.",
