                "reviewText": "This coat is impressive. I'm not sure I've said that before, but there it is. It's big, thick, heavy, has pockets everywhere you'd even think to reach for a pocket, and it is WARM. Like, it's hard to really try it on for long indoors warm. Chicago winters are pretty cold so that's a plus for me, if you have mild winters where you live this coat will be hot as heck. I thought the shoulder straps were a gimmick when I saw the pics, now I know I'm actually going to use those bad boys lol. I'm 6'4 and like 165 lbs, so finding a coat that fits my length without being poofy and letting wind up my belly can be a challenge. I really wasn't sure which I'd like better between L and XL, but reviews said size up and my height isn't even on the chart, so I went XL. Glad I did. Plenty of room for hoodies or sweaters but not so much it'll let wind in. That said, if you fill out a traditional XL pretty well I'd go up one again. It's baggier than L but not as big as standard US XL. Perfect.",

Will do for what I need, though I might not have bought it if I'd had a chance to try it on in a store because a couple of the pockets are awkwardly sized and I'm not a big fan of high relatively stiff collars.

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my son who is 6\u20194\u201d. We went with the xl so the sleeves would be long enough. He has a thin build, so it does look a little big, but he can fit hoodies underneath it and still be comfortable. The jacket is much heavier than I thought it would be, but very warm and he got a kick out of the straps inside.",
