They keep their shape after washing and I line dry wrinkle-free after 5 mins in the dryer. My only minor complaint is that this sweater jacket isn't very flattering from the backside and it does pill after awhile. But I mostly wear them around the house, so it's no issue for me, personally.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this in the khaki and fell in love. Immediately, I wanted another neutral so I bought the black. I have had it like over a week sitting in the bag and decided I needed to steam it and hang it up. I put it on a hanger and then thought I was losing it....there are no pockets. My khaki one has pockets so then I thought maybe I ordered the wrong thing so I went to the order and it says \"with pockets.\" So, I am a pocket girl, I like them, I use them and now I have none on this item. I'm not sure if it's a deal breaker and if I want to pack it up and return it. I havent decided. Other than the false advertising or lack of pockets, the sweater quality remains the same. It's nice quality and beautiful. Classy sweater and can really dress up an outfit. There were many reviews complaining about the wrinkles but it's time to get with the program and buy a steamer. Let's be real here - you are saving money by buying a dupe of another very expensive item. I have very expensive and luxury items and many wrinkle. It's just the nature of the beast sometimes. I've found a steamer fixes the issue quickly without much hassle or harsh lines. Not to mention you can steam pretty much anything. It's worth the investment if you plan to look good on a buck!",
