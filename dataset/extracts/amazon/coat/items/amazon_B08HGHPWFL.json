I wanted something classic and timeless, double-breasted with a nice lapel and in a camel color to wear both with jeans and with more dressy outfits, especially because I travel to Europe in the winters and want to change my black puffer coat for something more sophisticated. This camel coat fits the bill to a T!!. The quality is unbelievable. It is a nice thick wool material, fully lined, quality buttons a with two button holes -- one on either side of the coat, which means that you can wrap the coat either from left to right or right to left when buttoning it closed ( I hope that makes sense). I sized up from my normal and it fits as if tailored to me. The arms are long enough to go past my wrist and although I am only 5'4, hits at the perfect spot on my calves.I wore it around the house for a few minutes and it's definitely VERY warm and a nice weighted material. Do not hesitate at all to buy, this is a great find at an amazing price point!",

                "reviewText": "This coat surprised me. There were some mixed reviews but I couldn\u2019t pass up the Amazon Big Deal Day price point. I ordered two, one large and the other medium. Medium came first and it fits perfectly. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d, 155lbs, 36C, athletic build with broader shoulders. Medium sized coats normally fit me everywhere but the shoulders, which is why I ordered the large too, but this one is perfect. I wanted to make sure I could layer underneath and it works for that. I can put on an oversized sweatshirt and it\u2019s still comfy and I can move in it (it still buttons too). The camel color has more of an orange hue than I\u2019d like but not enough for me to send it back. I was also hoping it would stop right above my knee, but instead it\u2019s right below, but again, not enough for me to send it back. And the sleeves are indeed short, can fit 3 fingers between the coat and my hand, but I\u2019ll be wearing longer sleeves under it, so not too worried. This is the same quality as the wool-ish coat I got from Target a few years ago. It will be perfect for fall!",

I was a bit unsure as I am not a very fashion-forward person, but my friend convinced me to buy it and I am pleased she did. It fits great, it\u2019s warm, and it\u2019s a nice color. I think my only gripe is that it doesn\u2019t really cover the top of your chest even when it\u2019s buttoned up, but I think this can easily be solved by wearing a scarf or just making sure what you have underneath doesn\u2019t leave your chest too exposed.",
