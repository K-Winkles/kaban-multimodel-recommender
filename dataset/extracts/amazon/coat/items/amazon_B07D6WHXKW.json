It is so soft and I love the rich color purple. It is light weight yet warm. You can zip it up or leave it open. Wear it if you have to go to hospital because you can just zip it part way if needed. It is equally soft on the inside. I haven\u2019t washed it yet but being a seamstress it will wash up nicely in cold or warm water. Hope this review helps.",

If you have a little pudge, the belt never stays closed and exposes what you're trying to keep hidden and warm. But this winter has been especially cold and I had enough. I read the reviews and decided to take the leap. Let me tell you... I'm 4'11, the sleeves are a little long and this robe goes all the way down to my ankles. It is so soft and comfy. Warm but not too heavy. It does shorten my stride walking and my black fuzzy slippers complete the penguin walk or the Fester Addams look. But I am finally warm and in my own darn house so I don't care. It even has pockets to carry tissues, for the rom coms I watch and no one can tell I was crying. You will love this robe!
