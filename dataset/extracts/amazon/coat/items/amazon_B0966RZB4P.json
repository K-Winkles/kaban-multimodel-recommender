Wear this with rubber boots and you\u2019re dry all over. Fits true to size. I appreciate the quality for the price. Not bulky. Will fold up in a backpack at a theme park (bought ours for Disney).

I am 6 feet tall and It fits me well with good room available for walking in the rain. It is long enough to cover the legs below the knees. The hood is big enough to cover my face.It does not have a lining so will work well in the summer. In cooler weather it is large enough to give room to wear a heavier sweat coat or puffy jacket to keep warm.It appears to be relatively well made with a decent zipper and snap buttons.I like it very much.",
