The waist band in the back hits me perfectly. I have always been concerned about a jacket in this length because of my shorter height, but it is much more flattering than I anticipated. I expected I would end up returning it but gave it a try anyway, I took a chance, and I am so glad that I did. Even at my shorter height the jacket length is perfect, especially when I am waring skirts or dresses for work. I especially like the fact that I can remove the hood and the collar is substantial enough to keep the warmth around my neck even without the hood. The weather has been in the -10 degrees and this jacket kept me warm! I am so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and gave this coat a try! If you are a petite woman, do not let that scare you! The Coat is very flattering even for a shorter person like myself.",

                "reviewText": "I like the warmth this provided while shoveling snow. The neck provides extra warmth and the interior cuffs keep out the cold wind. The fabric and construction are fine. The style is great, especially with the hint of a waist in the back. It's so much better than the big refrigerator look. The buttons let you run outside for a few minutes without messing with the zipper. The pockets are placed well and padded for warmth. I think I'll get many years out of this coat.",

Loved the pillow collar & length of the coat, but the pockets were very awkwardly placed & very uncomfortable. The pockets were placed on the front of the coat, on top of the hip/upper thigh area vs. the sides where your arms/hands naturally hang. Aside from that it had great fixtures, look & warmth, just wish I could've found it in a sze larger.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5' tall and this coat is almost ankle length on me. What's great about it is that the zipper ends around my knee, and I was able to sew magnetic snaps around the hem and lining to add a really killer knee length configuration to it. I can let it out if I want the full-length insulation, or tack it up to look less ridiculous when conditions are better. In New England, you do what you've got to do.I have a lot of good things to say about this coat as-is, or I wouldn't have bothered modifying it. The material is heavier than a lot of puffers, and it doesn't feel delicate around the seams, buttons, or snaps. It has a soft sheen but isn't too shiny. The panel of smocking across the back of the waist adds a mildly flattering cinch to the practical comfort of the sleeping bag silhouette.The hardware is all good quality- I've gotten some really feeble zippers lately but this isn't one of them. The zipper has chunky plastic teeth with metal zips, and the snaps and drawstring toggles are all metal. The whole lining was thoughtfully constructed from different materials (fleece and something sateen) which are pleasantly soft and warm. The pockets are deep and strong, and the hood actually stays on. The neck pillow thing is a lot less weird than it looks, it's a great alternative to nasty faux fur ruffs and keeps the wind out of the neckline. The arm cuffs are very good at sealing the wrists without any scratchy knit ribbing. This is on par with more expensive coats I have seen and owned.",

My shoulders are unusually large, and the Medium is very slightly tight with multiple layers of shirt and sweaters underneath, but I would not have been happy with a large. The hood zips off, which is great for times when you want a more formal look. The hood stays forward on your head, and is therefore perfect for snow or rain. Slightly unhappy with the fabric used to fashion the inside of the pockets. It's quite thin, and the cold wind gets to your hands, but if you use gloves, you're fine. The pockets are deep, and I like that. There is also a snap panel at the back, which is great because the coat is so long. If you need to climb or walk quickly, you can unsnap the back and open up your stride a bit. Overall, very, very happy.",
