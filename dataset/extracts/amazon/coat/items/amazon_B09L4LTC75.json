                "reviewText": "I got this coat in preparation for my first winter in Chicago and it's been put to the test so far with -10 degree weather, with wind chills in the -20 to -30 degree range. (Fahrenheit)As it's gotten colder I've started wearing sweaters underneath it. It's worked very well with light and medium-thickness sweaters and I've been able to walk my dog and spend 30+ minutes out in the cold without feeling too cold.My only nit-picks with this coat are the pockets can get cold quickly when your hands aren't in them, but they do a good job of staying warm when your hands are in them.And when wearing thicker sweaters underneath, the buttons come undone when I lean over or get in my car.Durability is decent but there is already a tear in the left armpit and I've been very careful to hang up the coat when I'm not using it and I can't think of any times I stretched it too much, so I don't know where the tear came from.",
