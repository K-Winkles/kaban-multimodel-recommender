The coat is a comfortable length, a tad shorter than standard \"car coat\" length. I feel warm as toast when I wear it. The faux fur is a bit cheesy but I'm still brushing it smooth. This was a smart purchase. I can snap it closed or use the zipper for especially cold days. Definitely waterproof. Love the look and feel of this outerwear and I will definitely repurchase in another color.",

I can\u2019t saw enough good things about this coat. Excellent quality, kept me toasty, wasn\u2019t too bulky or heavy, & it was cute. I tested it on the bay all day & during the night. Weather was mainly 28F to 12F. Kept me warm the whole time. Several of my Maine friends even asked where I got it & asked me to send them the link \ud83d\ude0e Maine approved. I\u2019m a curvy girl & the fit was great. I usually wear a 16-18 & I got a 4x ( I could have sized down, but I wanted an oversized look). The adjustable waist made it easy to cinch in if you wanted oversized with a little more structure/shape. Hood is big & a little floppy which I prefer. I wear a lot of high messy buns in my hair & it fit perfectly. 10/10 Recommend.",

It\u2019s thick without being too bulky and is perfectly weighted. My only complaint is that there aren\u2019t any pockets that go in at an angle for your hands but there\u2019s plenty of pockets overall. It did get rained on a little and it repelled it nicely. Overall, I would definitely recommend this coat! I sized up just to be on the safe side with my trip being less than 3 days from time of order but this product does fit true to size so you\u2019ll be fine ordering your regular size. I\u2019m hoping they make the pants to match because I love this coat lol",
