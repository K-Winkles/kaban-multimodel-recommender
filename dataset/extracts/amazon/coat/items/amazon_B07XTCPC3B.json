                "reviewText": "If you could find it, off the store rack it would be a $200. coat. The off white is very elegant. I notice in different lighting the color can be nearly white, or a cream ivory - mine doesn\u2019t reflect yellow at all. Love the contrasting black buttons. Arrived very folded and wrinkled, after barely 10 minutes steaming with my handheld Beautral steamer, both the lining and outer coat were wrinkle free! It\u2019s so heavy to hold, but when wearing it the weight is so well distributed that I only notice how incredibly comfortable it is. I love the nice long sleeves and the perfect length for me, 5\u20195\u201d 118lbs. Santa also purchased the wine red with matching buttons for me and it is perfect just like the off-white! (I returned the first off-white because it had specks of red and blue on it and the replacement had chips of black that came off with the tape roller - so glad I was patient because these coats are classic styles and will last for many years). Great buy!",

The color was NOT off-white, instead it was a pale pink/yellow color. It was absolutely horrible. I didn't get the item I ordered and appears it was sent from a different place. So very disappointed .",
