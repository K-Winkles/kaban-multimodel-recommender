It's light material and is especially great for humid areas. My son is 11 and almost 5ft tall and weighs 95lbs. I ordered the large and it fit perfectly over his shirt and jacket. Plenty of room for growth as well. I will definitely be ordering this again as he needs bigger sizes.",

I think we could've even gone with a medium to get even more life out of it, however the small fits perfectly on him (he is a skinny, short kid for his age). The jacket is a shell and not insulated, but it is well made and appears very waterproof and will work over a long sleeve shirt or light hoodie very well. I really like the quality of this jacket",

It is thin but I like that because my son can wear layers if it's cold or just a tshirt underneath if it's hot. The thin material also allows for flexibility when dodging raindrops and jumping in epic puddles. The construction and materials feel and look solid. I regard to the fit, my son is 8 and in 50th percentile, I bought him a medium and it looks good. I think he can get this year as well as next year out of it.",

So I returned it and bought a size 14-16 instead. Its a little big but still fits well. Its very light as the purpose is to keep one dry from the rain. It is not meant to provide warmth as it has no insulating layer. More of a spring and fall jacket when it rains but is not wintery cold. It looks great, provides good protection from rain and my son loves it.",

I just needed a light jacket that was waterproof, and I'd ordered and returned several (or found out the hard way) that most were only water RESISTANT, which doesn't work for a little boy who wants to splash and stomp in the rain in the middle of summer in New Orleans.My son is 19 months old, 26lbs, 33\" tall. Ordered 2T and it's large but that's okay, he can grow into it. The tag says this jacket is WATERPROOF. I have NOT gotten the opportunity to test this yet, but it's Columbia so I have high hopes.Pockets are angled \"up\" rather than \"down\" which I assume is to keep rain out, but it is awkward for little wrists.",
