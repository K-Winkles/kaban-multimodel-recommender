                "reviewText": "01/24: \"Chilly\" Festival Friendly! Wanted something to keep me warm in 40-50 degree weather, but that I could also compress into a hydration back pack ! This was perfect! .... love the ability to easily roll it into the included compact bag; I just wear with the bag attached as it arrived... u don't feel it...and you'll never lose it....it looks good on... fits great.... & was warm enough - it really does retain body heat.... all that plus its lightweight w/no added bulk! Ive had no issue with the zipper...but remember its only like a 30-40 dollar jacket...so just be patient & careful with it is all and don't expect to wear it snug and not have an issue with the zipper eventually ... Will also be taking it snowboarding soon. Very happy with this affordable purchase. Great value. (Size M, Black)UPDATE: 02/24.... purchased a 2nd jacket in Size: L: .... worked perfect for me as a snowboarding mid layer! ... as a 1st timer to snow, this made it easy for me paired with just a balaclava hoodie, a set of thermals, a bib pant, snowboarding socks & gloves I was comfortably warm as it was snowing with temps in the 20s described as a part cloudy, part sunny day with 2inches of snowfall expected (after 11inches the day prior) .... . I didn't need my top layer jacket... I stayed warm ... I remained dry .... I ended up purchasing the Sz: L to allow for layering & for more movement. It worked perfectly ... highly recommend...Item travels EXCELLENT! .... easy to care for... will likely purchase other colors as needed.... so for me at: 5'7\", 170 ... size M for daily casual wear, and size L for winter sports at a bargain price & nothing bulky to store as I live in a tropical climate. Stores away easily taking up no space until the next trip.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a few similar jackets from different manufacturers and the plan was to keep the one that fit the best. This one came in second place, and I had to return it because another one fit me a little better. I ordered the small, and I am 5'6\" tall and 150 lbs with short limbs and a wide frame. Nothing fits me well, so I usually have to settle for something that is close but not perfect. This jacket fit perfectly, but the sleeves and overall length were just a little bit longer than a competitor. I honestly would have kept this jacket if I had not tried the competitor's, because the extra length was negligible and comfortable. Generally speaking, this jacket style runs a little long in the sleeves for people like me with short arms. Then, if you buy a size extra-small (usually not available), it's too tight or too short in the overall length. This is a nice, well-constructed, lightweight jacket that feels warm. It's much lighter than a parka but it seems like it will work for cold and wet weather around 40-45 F. The hood also fits well without a hat and it seems like a very functional go-to jacket for cold rainy weather. The wrist elastic could be a little tighter in my opinion, but it's basically snug around the wrist. You can probably put a few stitches in the material and make it tighter with some clever sewing.",

                "reviewText": "I love the color of this jacket (green) and the feel and the weight, but it was just one of those things where the fit didn\u2019t quite work for me. When my arms were all the way down it was fine, but if I started to raise my arms at all it would kind of bunch up and pull weird at my chest and back, if you know you know. I have pretty broad boulder shoulders so this isn\u2019t a rare occurrence for me. I still think this is a great jacket and worth trying, it will likely fit and be comfortable for most people, I just have odd body dimensions. It was real nice and warm too and I love that it can be packed into a bag.",

I layer this with a rain jacket on windy days or rainy days. Works great to layer with fleece coats also. Zippers all work great and are easy to use. Lightweight and compressed into the included carry bag makes packing for travel convenient. Fits as expected for size. I appreciate the hood on those chilly days when I must pump gas without having to keep up with a hat/beanie to keep my head and ears warm.",

Ebbene, ottimo, davvero ha superato le mie aspettative, niente da indiviare a capi di marca, per 30\u20ac lo reputo un solenne affare. E' caldo, perfetto per periodo autunno/pre-inverno, molto comodo, essendo in tutto e per tutto elasticizzato, ma nel contempo copre benissimo e aderisce molto bene al corpo, rendendolo anche gradevole alla vista (niente effetto mongolfiera, per intenderci \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02). Unico appunto, e ringrazio i molti utenti che hanno recensito: io solitamente vesto 48 alias L, e sappiamo tutti che ormai le taglie sono come le opinioni \ud83d\ude09 , avevo in carrello la L, ma poi, leggendo bene, ho deciso di puntare su una M... PERFETTA!!! La L sarebbe stata abbondante!!! Consiglio anche io una taglia in meno a chi ordina. Prodotto straeccellente \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

Why? It's so light that you don't know you're wearing it, windproof, warm (surprisingly given that it's so thin and packs down into the supplied small bag), showerproof and comfortable. The warmth is the most surprising thing; -3 degrees today and I'm still not getting cold.
