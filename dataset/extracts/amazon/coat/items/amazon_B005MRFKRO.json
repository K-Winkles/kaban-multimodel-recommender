Normally I wear a 2X Tall. I ordered a 3X Tall, to be able to wear a heavy flannel shirt underneath. There will be no problem. I had originally ordered a perma loft jacket same size from LL Bean and had to return it. Even with just a T-shirt underneath the zipper barely closed and forget about being able to move my arms, very tight. This jacket is true to size and $100 cheaper. The construction is very good, detachable hood, storm cuffs, wind/rain resistant and very soft lining inside. If you\u2019re a size like me and not some skinny male model, don\u2019t be afraid about ordering it. It looks very good when worn. It will keep you warm without being bulky. Excellent job Amazon/Boulder Creek.",
