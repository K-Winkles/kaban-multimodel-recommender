                "reviewText": "I bought this jacket in black - medium. I thought about getting a small and so glad I didn't. I bought this jacket to go with my NYE dress. It is form fitting and flattering. The button is in the perfect spot (on me) and the tie makes it that much better. I am 5'4 ish, 150-160 lbs, with an hour glass shape. I'm usually a small in shirts (can fit some mediums but some can be a little big), and a 7-11 in jeans...all depends on the cut and how stretchy they are since my hips are wide and butt is big. 34c, 26-27 waist, 41 hip. I was looking for a jacket like this for an hr and a half. I saw this and showed my bf, both said hands down THIS was the winner! No question! I tried it on and fell in love \ud83d\ude0d. I saw reviews that said the arms were tight, this is why I went with the medium. They ARE right, the arms are a little tight, but comfortable on the medium. I had a tight, red, long-sleeved, velvet, bodycon, v-neck dress under it and had to hold the sleeves as i put the coat on or it pulled them up. As I get older, my arms get fatter lol. It just seemed like this jacket was made for me (and it has pockets even though theyre placed further back than im used to!! They are a good size and held my cards, etc,. I was so excited for that lol). It is flattering in my chest, waist, and butt. I can see this jacket being flattering for many body types. It is lined, it kept me warm (and it was cold). There was a lot of little threads everywhere. Most were not attached. But there was a 5 to 6 inch thread attached and hanging from the lapel. It feels heavy and sturdy. The only con, it makes my hair sooo staticky and i never have that issue lol (not a bad con). I will update my review if any of this changes.",

                "reviewText": "No matter what angle I looked at myself in this coat, it fit wide through the chest. The puff on the shoulders also accentuated the width on me. I have broad shoulders for being skinny but I just didn't look myself on top. I will probably alter the chest and back panels by an inch on each side myself. It was wishful thinking because I wear a 0-2 and this brand starts at size 4.Note, this is not warm by any means. I wore it with a tank top, thermal top and 2 thin work sweaters. I was still cold in 50 degree weather.",

                "reviewText": "I am so disappointed in this item! I wanted to love this coat, as it is gorgeous, but it arrived with no sash to tie. That seemed like a simple fix, so I emailed the company about the issue and simply asked them to send me a sash to go with my coat that was supposed to come with one anyway. They emailed back and told me that since it was ordered from Amazon, they couldn't do anything to resolve the issue. Why include a card with the product telling customers to contact them if there is an issue if they will do nothing to resolve the issue??? I am at a loss as to how to fix this issue going forward, so I will definitely be returning.",

                "reviewText": "Usually I wear size L, but the coat was a bit tight in the arms. I need to be able to wear sweaters underneath, so I went up a size. It fit much better and allows me to wear thick sweaters underneath. Of course the waist is a too big, but with the design it is no problem. Wrap it a bit tighter and use the belt. The belt is extremely long. A con for the coat is getting the wrinkles from the shipping out, took me forever. Have not dry cleaned it yet, will update with the results. The cut of the coat is very flattering and I get compliments every time I wear it.",

                "reviewText": "This coat would be really great on a smaller woman. Unfortunately, it just isn't cut right for fuller figured women. For reference, I'm 5'3\" 40DDD 165lbs and I ordered the XL. The \"waist\" was right under my breasts and it looked absurd to have the belt that high. Also, just because you're chubbier doesn't mean your shoulders are wider. I wish designers realized that. The cute puff sleeves fell too low; Not at my shoulders but on my upper arms. I ordered the lavender but the color is more mauve. Still would have kept it in mauve if it fit right.",
