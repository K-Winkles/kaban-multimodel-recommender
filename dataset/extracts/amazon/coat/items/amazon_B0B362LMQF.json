Other \"waterproof\" jackets I've owned caused me to sweat while wearing them, but not this jacket; it's more breathable than others. The jacket runs large. I'm a medium but find the small fits me, provided I'll be wearing only a t-shirt underneath. The only downside for me was the fit across the chest I wish was roomier, but it's certainly passable.",
