                "reviewText": "I was looking for a coat that would survive the well below zero windchills we were going to get because my usual winter hoodie wasn\u2019t going to cut it! Of course I waited until the last minute to order it but it came when I needed it too.I like camouflage but it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice in a coat. But when you want it by 7 AM the next day you take what you can get!I love this coat! It\u2019s very well made, it withstood -23 windchills! I wasn\u2019t super toasty but I was protected very well from the elements.I\u2019m a xxl girl - 218 with my weight focused on my middle - and this fit perfectly!! The arms are adjustable with Velcro on the wrists. The hood is adjustable as well to keep the wind out.The one, teeny tiny thing that\u2019s a little annoying is that there isn\u2019t anything that keeps the zipper from pressing against your mouth when you have it zipped all the way up. Totally not a deal breaker but annoying nonetheless.I would highly recommend this jacket!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a lighter-weight winter coat with zippered pockets to keep keys/cash/phone secure and this is a perfect coat for that. I love the color, the sizing was accurate, it is a very warm coat and I like that the hood can be taken off when not needed. The only thing I am a bit worried about is the coat's main nylon zipper, it got stuck a bit when zipped up-thought I'd have to pull over head to take it off but worked with it for a couple of minutes and its fine. I'll just be careful when zipping it but overall I am glad I picked this coat and would buy it again.",
