                "reviewText": "Both my grandson & I love this coat. The olive green color is beautiful, the coat is well made, durable & toasty warm. The hood covers the complete head & has faux fur surrounding it for additional warmth. The advertisement shows a hood with a distinctly better quality of hood fur than the coat actually has. The perceived fur quality was 1 of the reasons I chose this coat, so that was a disappointment. The fur isn\u2019t bad, it just doesn\u2019t look fluffed out & soft like the photo. The coat has many other great qualities, like the multiple pockets , the longer length & the ribbed cuffs, that overshadow the fur issue. I purchased a size 6-7, which is 1 size larger than my grandson wears ( he almost wears a 6). The coat fits nicely with room to grow , we just have to slightly roll up the ribbed area of the wrist cuffs. The coat comes in other great colors & its a must have for cold winter weather.",
