If you go to Calvin Klein's website, they have a more accurate size chart (picture attached). Luckily, I already had this coat in a different color I bought at a Dillard's, so I already knew what size I needed. As others have stated, the coat came crammed into a small plastic bag, so it was pretty wrinkled. It does seem to be a legitimate Calvin Klein coat as I compared it to the other one I have. I'm going to try steaming it to get the wrinkles out. Amazon definitely needs to improve their packaging. But overall this is a great coat - love the fit and the classic, sleek look.",

                "reviewText": "Love the coat and it looks great. It's very fitted. The pockets need to be onstitched as all good coats pockets are stitched and suits. However, the white label on the sleeve is very hard to remove. It actually pulls up some of the camel when you are trying to remove it with a seam ripper. As far as I know you never leave that white label on the sleeve, And I don't know why it is so hard to get off - other than that I adore this coat. It would not hurt to go up a size from what you normally wear, so that you can wear thick sweaters or a suit under it.",

Does come a bit creased but they ironed out and can also just take to the cleaners for a press. She\u2019s tried it on and fit is great, I think sleeves a little long as she\u2019s 5\u20192 but she likes the length. Ordered 8 think she weighs 128ish I think and smaller busted. A little snug around belly area in a very heavy hoodie but she wouldn\u2019t be wearing with that anyway. She did not think too tight however. It is not oversized but just right for her\u2026.a 10 would have been too big in the top. Very classic and lovely.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been searching for an affordable, quality wool coat that isn\u2019t too long and this is perfect! The materials listed are accurate, this is not too heavy but is still 63% wool. Total length is about 36 inches.The buttons are reinforced with thread and buttons on the back, all lines are straight. The outside pockets are large and there is even a bonus inside pocket that is deep! The lining is silky and feels really nice to slip on. The outside is not itchy like other wool coats. I wish it had another button on the bottom to keep it closed.I carefully took off the sleeve label with an eyebrow razor and tweezers, and it looks fine. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d, 130 lbs, 34 inch bust and ordered a 4, length hits above the knee, enough room without being oversized. This is listed on the Calvin Klein website for a much higher price, really great buy!EDIT: I repurchased in a size 6 after the 4 was too tight with a sweater on. As you can see in the photos they are different colors, the 6 is darker camel and the 4 is lighter tan. Size 6 has a lighter lining with a maroon trim. They both feel the same, I\u2019ll be keeping the 6 based on the fit. I recommend going up one size if you plan on layering, there isn\u2019t a huge difference between sizes, it\u2019s still flattering.",

                "reviewText": "Why anyone would take such a beautiful coat and put it all rumpled up in a plastic bag like some bedding is beyond me. Once I knew my wife liked this coat and that it fit I had to get it dry cleaned and pressed to remove all of the creases that were in it from it's bagging so there's more expense I didn't count on. Additionally the tag needs to be removed by someone who knows how. Why anyone would sow a tag like that on a beautiful coat is beyond me also. The coat itself has a classic look and appears to be well made. Just don't count on it being much of a presentation at first.",

I can\u2019t believe I found a wool/cashmere coat at such a great price! P.S. I agree with other reviewers, the tag on the sleeve is very annoying and hard to get off. I used small sharp scissors and a lot of patience.",
