                "reviewText": "The faux suede has an inky feel to it, so the fabric feels nice enough. It\u2019s pretty much the fabric pieces cut out and quick stitched side to side. The only sections that are properly hemmed are the pockets. The coat length works for me, so all that\u2019s left is to take out all the seams and resew it properly. Could work for a quick costume piece as is but this isn\u2019t something I\u2019d wear on an outing. It saved a few bucks compared to getting fabric and cutting it by hand, so it\u2019s worth the gift card I used for it at least.",

I\u2019m far too old to get bamboozled like this but alas here I am, boo-boo the fool once again thanks to the NONSENSE clothing on this site. Zero stars, do not recommend.
