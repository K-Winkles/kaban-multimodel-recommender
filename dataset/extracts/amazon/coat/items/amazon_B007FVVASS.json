                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I've been using the Red Kap Shop Coat for 17 years. It continues to be my favorite.",
                "reviewText": "The Red Kap Men's shop coat is still my favorite in comparison to other offerings on the market. I've been buying the Red Kap shop coats for close to 20 years now. I still have my original and it still is in good condition. The old coat is a size or two too small now (my fault not Red Kap's lol). I've been wearing these shop coats daily for the past several years and intermittently prior to that in an active industrial production / engineering laboratory setting. On examining the latest purchase, I was relieved to find that the fabric weight and cut hasn't changed after all these years. If you bought one in the past, you know what to expect from the current product. For those that haven't worn one of these before, this isn't a lab coat, it's a shop coat. The material is much thicker. If you hold it up to the light, it's practically opaque, whereas a lab coat is more translucent. Night and day difference. My lab is 68F (20C) and I stay comfortable when wearing a long sleeve shirt/t-undershirt combo underneath the shop coat. Another aspect of the shop coat that I like is the cut. It is 'fit' on the shoulders/torso without restricting mobility. The bottom has enough of a bell shape that I never notice any pulling of the material between my butt and the chair when I frequently transition from standing to sitting throughout the day. The slash openings are also sized and positioned well. I can get to my front, rear and cargo pockets on my pants without a problem, even when sitting. I take maybe a size large in gloves, and have no issue getting my bare hands through the opening. I haven't tried it with gloves. I wear the shop coat to keep my clothes clean and well, my gloves aren't clean so I take them off first. The pockets on the shop coat are generously sized and located in just the right spot. I carry tools in them occasionally and they haven't broken through the bottoms of the pockets. The pen divider on the left breast pocket can handle regular pens and well as something with a larger diameter like a fine point sharpie permanent marker. The upper pocket depths are deep enough that I don't often have loose objects fall out when I bend over to pick something up. The right breast pocket is also wide enough to handle a modern smart phone in a heave duty case. The collar of the coat doesn't curl up in odd ways. It holds its shape well. The arm lengths feel right. The snap closures on the front of the coat do their jobs year after year and only gave me a problem when I tried fitting too much body into too small of a shop coat. That's a personal problem though, no fault of the snaps. :-) The stitching throughout matches the durability of the material. I've snagged the slash opening pretty hard on several occasions and didn't pop any stiches. Snagging the slash openings is something to be aware of with any shop or lab coat, so it just comes with the territory and I can't knock points off for that. I'd rather have the openings than not have them. They are set far enough to the back that this is not regular issue at all. To sum it up, this is the best shop coat I've used. I will continue to trust ordering this tested and well thought out design.",
