What is unusual about this rain gear set is that it is fitted, cute, and comfortable, more like normal clothes. The material feels nice and lightweight. Easy zip and velcro, keeps the water out. I bought it for biking and garden working in the rain. It served well to keep me dry and warm, the water runs off easily, and it dries quickly. This rain gear set is great. Highly recommend. If you are doing high exertion work and sweating for 1/2 hour or more, you will get hot and need to unzip to let the air in and out. The roll-away hood is a great feature; if you wear a helmet, you can tuck it away for extra neck padding, and if you are walking down the street, you can pull the hood back out.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very pleased with this rain jacket! I did a lot of research before choosing this product and I'm glad I did. Great features and thoughtful touches I really like include the following:- It's a lightweight shell, so I can wear it in the late spring and summer as well. Really - there is no filler so you have to wear layers during colder weather.- I tried both the Large and Medium and kept the Large because the Medium felt too uncomfortably tight. I'm 5'4\" with a 37\" bust and 37\" hips, which is why I had initially ordered the Medium based on the sizing chart. However, the Large feels much much more comfortable without seeming baggy, especially around the bottom hem. (I'm wearing a thin shirt and sweater underneath in both photos.) I could've been OK with the Medium size because it didn't restrict my movement, but I'm glad I was able to return it. As the photos show, the two sizes don't look substantially different, though.- It has three pockets (yay): one on the inside and two side slit pockets on the outside. They are all zippered (yay). The outside pockets have vertical openings, but they drop down into a well so I worry less about items falling out.- There's a drawstring around the bottom hem and the hood, as well as velcro fasteners around the wrist areas to tighten those openings around your body.- The jacket has an interesting feature I've never seen before and like: you can tuck in the hood into the collar and fasten that collar closed with velcro. So the hood is not removable but you can tuck it away. I uploaded a photo of that tucking in process partly in progress.- I ordered the bright blue jacket so that it's easier for drivers on the road to see me when it's dark and raining. It's a tasteful bright blue hue rather than a garish one. (The interior lining is red.)Overall it feels like a high quality jacket, and the price is fantastic, especially given all these features.",

That was disappointing since I purchased a size L, but going up to an XL would make it too large in the shoulders and arms. Dorie",
