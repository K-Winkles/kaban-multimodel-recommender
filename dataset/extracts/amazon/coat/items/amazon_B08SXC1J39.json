My kids wear them in spring and fall. They\u2019re super cute and the colors are spot on, they fit pretty true to size- but i always size up if we are on the fence so we can get some more use of our them.I will say we have had a few zipper issues- where the zipper is sort of \u201csticky\u201d and it takes a few tries to get it moving. But that\u2019s not a deal breaker for me, it doesn\u2019t happen all the time.",

It\u2019s a great lightweight coat that\u2019s perfect for the milder Bay Area weather. I also like that it is a long coat, so even with the wind it\u2019ll keep the little warm and toasty. I\u2019m hoping this will be warm enough for the winter over a thick jumper. Zippered pockets are also a plus.",
