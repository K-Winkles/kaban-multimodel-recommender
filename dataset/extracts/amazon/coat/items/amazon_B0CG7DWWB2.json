                "reviewText": "I was rather surprised by how much I liked this fleece top. I'm usually a fan of eddie bauer (tall fit and quality), but I only buy their full zip-ups now because I'm starting to occasionally over heat in them. I'm 46 so you could maybe blame it on pre-menopause, but maybe some other agree. This lands end top never got overly hot. It was comfortable indoors and out. I just wore it on a -5 F day in Minnesota, in and out of a car. I should have worn a thicker coat outside, but had to wear a thinner, but normally winter-wearble \"work\" jacket. I was in and out of a vehicle. I do feel like the fabric \"breaths\" a bit more than my usual fleece tops and likely the reason I didn't overheat. I'm going to buy more if the price is decent. I'm 5'9\" 145lbs 36B female and hover between a medium and large (tall version). The medium (tall) fit good. Not too tight, not too loose. I questioned upon opening if it had enough shoulder room. It did and was comfortable with normal amount of arm movement. If i were trying to wear this doing some more physical tasks, sports, or repairs- I may recommend a size up for shoulder width. The waist is maybe a bit big if you're skinny, but I think it fits the average female just fine and covers slight stomach issues without having to get a larger size. The partial zip and neckline is perfect for wind and cold, but easy to unzip a little if you find yourself indoors. Soft. Thickness good, not too thick but thick enough. Tiny bit of stretch but not much. Overall very happy.",

It is also great alone w/ a vest or under a jacket.I bought 3 different colors: coral pink, red and light blue. The colors are bright and stay nice even after many washing. The top launders well.The size L is roomy, and the length is great.I normally would wear a M but bought the L to fit over a back brace. The top accommodated the exrta bulk and most people did not know I was wearing bulky brace.I would definitely recommend this 1/4 zip top.",
