It fits a little large (and isn't greatly flattering) but honestly, id rather be comfortable, warm and dry. The only downfall / Complaint i have is that there is no hood.I am from Massachusetts and recently took a weekend trip to nantucket for an event. Day 1 was fine and the jacket was great. Light weight but warm. 2nd Day - absolute down pour day and to make matters worse we had to take the ferry home and it was PACKED due to The upper outside deck being exposed to the weather.I get sea sick and with everything inside being so crammed (sitting on bags in the hallway of the ferry and stairs) I made the choice to sit outside.... let me tell you. This Jacket kept me warm and dry for the 2.5 hour ferry ride in the rain.... (i had a hat for my head) but other than that, warm and dry!!BEST jacket for the price",

                "reviewText": "Okay, I'm sure it would be warm. But would I go out of the house with it on to test it out? Ha. If I wanted to give my neighbors a laugh! It looks nothing like the picture. I died laughing at myself when I put it on. I looked like a stuffed gray roly-poly! A tube of stuffing. A sleeping bag. Absolutely no shape to it. It flared out right under the pockets to make it even more unflattering. I can't remember the size I bought. I'm normally a L/XL but I think, per the reviews, I sized down to a medium. It was just so bad on me. But all that to say, if looking gray and shapeless fills you with joy, then by all means this is the winter coat for you! I can't vouch for the warmth since I never went outside with it on.",

                "reviewText": "Just received this coat and it seems pretty substantial for keeping the winter wind and temperatures away from you. Particularly if you want to wear a hat with it. The zipper is fine; the insulation is puffy. Two outer pockets seem to be fleece-lined. You could go for a walk, sit somewhere awhile and this coat would be fine. I particularly noticed that the top shoulder seams are reinforced with tape or under-stitching which will help keep the shape of such a big puffy coat.",
