                "reviewText": "I bought this coat to wear to NYC in December. I am Texas born and raised so I don't do well in the cold. I'm 5'9\" and 250lbs. I got the size 3XL. This was the most comfortable and flattering coat out of the 4 different ones that I tried. I love this coat! The sleeves are long and cuffed which keeps your hands and arms very warm even without wearing gloves. The upper arms are very roomy and do not feel tight nor too baggy. The pockets are freakishly deep, I was able to carry a ridiculous amount of necessities while I traveled, including my hat, gloves, and a water bottle among other items. I hated the hood because it's awkwardly shaped and I honestly just threw it away. It is water resistant and insulated so I'd feel very confident wearing it in sleet and snow. The length was perfect to cover my stomach and backside; keeping cold air from coming up into the bottom of the coat. The only problem I actually experienced was with HOW WARM it actually is. When indoors or on the subway I would begin to overheat because it WAS so warm LOL! I would buy this again for sure, and wish I had tried it first before I wasted my time trying on 3 other coats. Can't wait to use it in the snow next!",

                "reviewText": "I buy A LOT of products off Amazon, but this coat has to be my absolute favorite purchase yet. The coat is a matte black. I absolutely love the material. I walk dogs so it gets dirty, but I just take a wet wipe over it and it works great to clean it. It\u2019s wipes off so easy, because of the material it doesn\u2019t get pushed and caked into it. It\u2019s so warm and it looks amazing. The pockets are deep and they can be buttoned together for extra security. There\u2019s a pocket on the inside of the coat as well. When you zip it up all the way, it will protect your neck completely. I love that the good comes on and off. I never write reviews, but I\u2019m so in love with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This is my second winter coat I purchased through this company and honestly it will be my go to for most coats from now on. My first coat lasted almost three years of rough wear which I wasn\u2019t expecting. This coat feels warm, fits perfectly, and the seams all beautiful sewn. I ordered a large and the tag ment to cut off says larger but the rage sewd to the coat itself says medium. I even got my boyfriend to order his coat from this company so I\u2019ll do a review with that one comes in also!",

I like the drawstring hidden at the waist to make it more windproof. I love the colour. I plan to add fur lining to the hood! It is not quite fitted, but the drawstring helps.",

There's another lower-down inner pocket perfect for reading glasses.It's cozy, tested at about 1C for me so far, and the pockets keep my bare hands relatively warm at that temp.The color is a tad brighter than the pictures, depending on your computer I suppose, but still a nice burgundy.",
