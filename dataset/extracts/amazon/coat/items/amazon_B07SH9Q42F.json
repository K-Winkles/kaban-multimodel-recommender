                "reviewText": "Overall this coat was durable and comfortable. I wore it through our mothers day dinner and it held up nicely. I gave it three stars because the utility pocket on the second sleeve is useless and combersome . I generally store my thermo and pens in my left shoulder pocket and my note pad in a chest utility pocket. There is no way a pad or phone or anything will stay on that other utility pocket on the sleeve so I would recommend just putting the second pocket on the front chest like the back vented coats . Other than that this is a nice cost for the price but if/when I order another one I will order the vent back instead of the side vent one .",
