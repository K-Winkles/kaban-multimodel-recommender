I would recommend using that to figure out what size you need. I honestly think I could have got an Xl and would have been ableTo button it up with room still.",

This version unexpectedly has the chest pocket sewn on the inside which is different from previous versions I've purchased. I personally dislike the chest pocket on the inside. The product description does reference this if you read the fine print. I would rate this four stars instead of three if the pocket were on the outside like previous versions. The manufacturer's website also describes the pocket as internal. Hopefully they will bring back the external chest pocket next time they do a production run.",
