                "reviewText": "I was not expecting to like or keep this but when it arrived it surprised me! The fabric is substantial and it\u2019s actually heavier than I thought but I think that\u2019s good. It\u2019s a very warm coat and the sleeves have cuffs. The zipper is substantial and works smoothly. The pockets are a nice size and close with a magnet. I was replacing a coat I lost. This coat is actually more flattering than the one I had. The length hits in the mid thigh and it fits slim not bulky. It zips without bulging and fits the body without looking like a huge puffer coat. I got the black and I love the black fur so much better than tan/brown I had before. Plus the hood is not oversized like so many coats. I had been looking at Macys and this coat is every bit as nice as coats I saw for over $200. I got a coupon for this one so the price was amazing for the quality. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this jacket last minute for a winter trip to Iceland. Did not expect much, but I wanted something longer to keep me warm and a down alternative.This jacket did impress me greatly!It passed the arctic winter test in Iceland, with heavy cold winds and temperatures around minus 10-15 Celsius! I also wore a hooded fleece jacket underneath for extra warmth and it was perfect. It kept the wind and the cold out, just absolutely amazing!!L is perfect for my size and some extra room inside (I am 5 feet 4 inches and weigh about 170 pounds and have a larger bust). I would say it is true to size. It looks good and slimming on. It has magnetic hidden buttons for the pockets which work great, but I would rather have zippers for extra security.The hood is kind of big, so be sure to wear an extra hat or hoodie underneath. And it does not have any additional drawstrings or something to adjust it around the head...Other than that, I just love the jacket so much!",

                "reviewText": "It's not that poofy for a puffer. I like the shape and stitching patterns, they're flattering. The length is good, it doesn't allow for cold and wind to get in from below. My previous jacket is very puffy and ended at my hips with an elastic band. It would ride up often and not fully cover me. Plus, the synthetic down would keep shifting, so I wound up with all the lining in the sleeves and front and none in the back. My one gripe is that there's nothing in particular that defines the waist. No pull strings or buttons. It all relies on the stitching pattern. I often work in a chiller and walk-in freezer (-10\u00b0). I used to layer two jackets going into the chiller as one was never enough. With this jacket, I only need to use this. With the freezer, we are provided freezer suits and I've also tended to layer my jacket with the suit. But now with this jacket on, I keep the suit front zipper open to vent out heat because I get too warm.Outside hasn't been too cold yet (writing this at the dawn of winter) but comparing this to my previous jacket, this one has made the weather feel more like a warm autumn day. The hood blocks my peripheral vision but it keeps the rain out. It hasn't been windy enough to comment on if the wind will pull the hood off my head.That all being said, I'm returning this color in exchange for pink because I forgot to factor in that the jackets they provide at work are the same color as this. I'm concerned if I hang it up anywhere, people are gonna use it.",

                "reviewText": "I was extremely pleased with the look and feel of this coat. I am 5\u20194\u201d, 165 and I got an XL. There is no extra room in it for bulky clothes but I really don\u2019t think I will need them. The fit is flattering!I ordered the royal blue but it is not as bright as the picture. I already knew this from reading some other reviews though and I did not want a bright blue so it was just what I wanted.It is not a 300-400 dollar coat so I wasn\u2019t expecting top of the line and it isn\u2019t, but it was better than expected for 62 dollars!The side (hand) pockets seem to be a very thin material and I don\u2019t expect them to hold up very long. Also, there is a piece of white (bias?) down the inside front seem that isn\u2019t noticeable from the outside but it doesn\u2019t look right when you look at the inside.All in all, this coat will serve me well (I hope) for walking my 2 golden retrievers and shoveling. I would not hesitate to wear this out to eat or to the store except that it might be too warm.I\u2019ll update further if I have any issues for the money, I think this is a good deal.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I live in Chicago so I need a quality winter coat and this definitely delivers. It is well-made and WARM! I love the knit cuffs for keeping cold air out. And the pockets - SO cozy and warm. I was nervous that they wouldn't be deep enough to hold my phone but they're perfect. And the magnets in the pockets - they're the thing I never knew I needed, and now I could never live without them. The hood, as others have mentioned, is big, but one thing I will say is that it actually stays in place and doesn't blow off when you put it up. It's also stylish and flattering. Personally I found the small to be just a smidge too big - I'm on the fence about trading it in for an XS (I'm 5'3, 130 lbs.) but I'll probably keep it, since I don't mind having a little extra room for bulky sweaters. All in all, great coat, especially for the price!",

Only issue I\u2019ve had is the zipper likes to stick. But that can be a common issue with any type of jacket.. the button up option works well when this happens. Another issue I noticed a few weeks after I had been wearing the jacket, is the color on the collar seemed to wear off. There is white streaked throughout the black. It is subtle, but still noticeable. I am behind my return window now or I would be asking for a refund",

I was not provided the correct tracking number from the beginning, it took four requests to finally receive the number. The company did maintain communication, but only after I initiated it. Proactive communication for late deliveries can save customers a lot of wondering!This item itself is awesome! Worth the wait, and a beautiful colour (in my opinion) I got the red coat, it is not as vibrant as in the photo it is more of a blood red which I love even more! I got a size small, which fits perfectly even with a sweater. The wrist bands are tight, I like this to keep wind and snow out!",
