                "reviewText": "Jacket is well made quality. Wore it for about 30 minutes in light/moderate rain during my 4 mile morning walk and stayed dried and surprisingly warm. I took it off when the rain stopped I was getting hot. It's not a light weight jacket to me. It's fully meshed lined, from front to back and the sleeves. No more sticking to your skin. I'm 5'10\" 165lbs and wear a large but I got a medium from looking at the size chart. It fits perfectly with room to spare. As far as the zipper being on the wrong side well mine's was on the correct side for a men's jacket. I'm gonna buy another one for the wife",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently bought this rain jacket designed to protect against wind and water and has a hood, two zipper pockets, and a spacious design. During my vacation in Kauai, where it rained heavily, this jacket proved invaluable. It kept me dry, and the well-designed breast pocket easily accommodated my iPhone 15 Pro Max. This ensured that my phone was protected and free from water damage.The only thing I wish different about this jacket, would be that the hood was a little bit bigger to cover my hat completely.I highly recommend this jacket for its functionality and reliability in unpredictable weather.",

At least you know a four-star review is genuine!",

Definitely say if you're a 2x look into a different item. Cause it definitely runs small. But it fit me still, but it snuggles on me and my curves.what I like about this jacket is it very fashionable and it does keep you warm. It is water resistant and I would say it can handle light rain or just a light down pour, but wouldn't recommend riding it in down pour, you'll still get wet. But it is very stylish and it's comfortable but will be perfect if it was a bit bigger.",
