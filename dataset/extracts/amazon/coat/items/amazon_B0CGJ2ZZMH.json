The Only drawback is they are all the same length. They need a long version. I would guess if you are 6 ft tall and above then it will be too short on you. My husband is 5\u201910\u201d and I wish it was a tiny bit longer but he likes it and so we will keep it.",

He said it was a little snug on the shoulders and short on the sleeves when he lifted his arms, but overall nice fit for the price. We might end up returning if we find a better fit elsewhere or have time to get something else tailored, but a good slim cut blazer if you need a quick find.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a size 38 for sportscoats and have ordered a number of them on Amazon from another brand in Medium that fit just fine. I haven't tried the Coofandy before, so I went ahead and ordered a gray colored one. It is a decent polyester sportscoat with a smooth exterior and a nicely lined interior. It was a little large on me both for the sleeve and the shoulders. I think that this would fit someone who is a 40, but if you are a 38 like myself, it may be too loose on you. Additionally, the shoulder pads on this sportscoat is bulky. It reminds me of the big shoulder pads in the 1980s/90s. On the sportscoat I received, the right shoulder pad was pointing a little upward at the end which made it look weird when wearing it. So in summary, if you are planning on ordering a Medium, it should fit well if you are a size 40, but will be too loose for size 38. Also, pay attention to the shoulder pad. Hopefully, you don't get one with an odd looking pad like I did. I eventually returned mine, but would have kept it if the shoulder pads weren't so big and odd looking.",
