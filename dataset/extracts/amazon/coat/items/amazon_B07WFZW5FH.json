                "reviewText": "Love this coat! I wasn't expecting too much for the price, but the quality is surprisingly decent!It's the perfect weight (not too heavy or bulky). The fabric blend is not scratchy at all- it's actually soft. I can't stand scratchy wool, it really irritates me!! I also don't like feeling confined by giant heavy coats, so this one is really comfortable.It's also very flattering, if coats can be considered \"flattering\" instead of just functional?It's fully lined with two large exterior pockets (big enough to hold my phone, keys, gloves, etc.). I like the length as well- it hits me just above the knee.For reference, I'm 5'3\", about 140 pounds, big chested with broad shoulders. I ordered a large and it's a perfect fit, even with a sweater and buttoned up.I hope this helps, I'm honestly really happy I took a gamble on this coat!",

I love the fit and look of this coat so much that I plan to get another one in a different color. It's quite warm enough for San Francisco winter, it gets as low as 30 degrees here but usually the temperature hovers around 56 degrees, so it probably will not be warm enough for an East coast winter but would work well for an East coast Fall.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this coat! Seems like most women\u2019s wool coats here in America have a tightly tailored upper trying to create a \u2018desired\u2019 silhouette. But I appreciate the oversized, gender neutral, minimalist style of this coat. It is a versatile layer for work, a dressy event and even just trying to step up your running errands look. It is exactly what I wanted.I am 5\u20193\u201d, an inverted triangle shape (broad shoulders, 38DDD, slimmer straight hips) and I love the fit. It is oversized, but I also ordered up a size (XL) because I don\u2019t like fitted things on my upper body, and I don\u2019t want my bust squeezed in and smushed look when buttoned up. This coat is double breasted, but the buttons hit below the bust line and creates a nice deep V that I like. The length hits me mid calf which is what I wanted. The sleeves are about and inch to long, but I know how to hem them up because the arms are always to long for me.The reviews were mixed on the weight and warmth, but it is plenty warm for me to wear to work everyday in DC winters. A scarf on cold days, to warm up the neck and gloves and I\u2019ll be good to go. It is not as heavy as some wool coats, buts it\u2019s got a nice weight to it. The label says 85%polyester and 15% wool.The coat will need a quick steam or ironing right out of the package, but the creases did come out easily for me. The only thing I don\u2019t like about the coat is that it attracts all the lint within like a four foot area, it\u2019s a magnet. I got the solid black so it is a little annoying, but I do think this is a trait of most wool blended coats.At right around $65, I would say it\u2019s a good value, I have no doubt I will get at least a few winter seasons from this coat. It feels well made.",

This coat, according to the measurements, fit the upper half of my body. It closed and all. But it's as if the makers of this coat did not factor in women's hips. If you have womanly hips or a derri\u00e8re, I would maybe size up.",

This coat is too expensive at $88 that's for sure. It's cheaply made and thin. A button came off as soon as I pulled it out of the package. This is not really a coat, it's too thin and not warm enough to call it a coat. It's also very clingy in the hips and should be more A-line. If it was a heavier material, it would not cling and would look better. A hoodie or a sweater would have more warmth. It's probably worth no more than $50 at the time of writing. China is taking advantage and not giving fair market value, that's for sure. I'm sending it back.",
