Which when you are 4, you need to always put on your jacket \"yourself\" so the fact that it zips easy is nice and keeps this mommy sane. Pockets are a good size for his hands and can fit 2 packs of fruit snacks or 4 medium rocks....cause you know, boy. Have washed it several times and it has no problem going in the washer or dryer, no melting or plastic smell after. Water and juice spill resistant, unlike the back seat of my car. Also keeps him warm, which is why we got the jacket.",
