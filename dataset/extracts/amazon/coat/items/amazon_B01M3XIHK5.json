Well almost.It fits just fine, but it\u2019s a tad snug in the hips. If you\u2019re planning on wearing a big, bulky sweater underneath it or if you\u2019d like a little more wiggle room around your butt, go up a size.It\u2019s poofy and warm and beautiful and I love the knitted wrists. They keep the sleeves from falling down over your hands and if you forget your mittens, you can just pull them down over your hands.I Love all the pockets and all of them are Deep!! You can easily fit your phone or a wallet in any of them, to include the 2 top zippered pockets and the inner zippered pocket!! We\u2019re going to Europe in April (to two of the pickpocket capitals of the world \u2639) and with all the pockets, I won\u2019t have to carry a purse!!P.S. I thought for sure the first thing I would do is get rid of the hood, but it actually works! I\u2019ll just have to get used to all the fur around my face \ud83d\ude0aP.P.S. Not having side pockets to slip your hands into is a bummer, but I\u2019ll live.",

                "reviewText": "This coat is phenomenal! It fits perfectly, and it's incredibly warm. It's very sturdy, with no buttons, snaps, or lining coming off. The pockets are big, which is always a plus as a girl. The colour is exactly as pictured as well. It is the warmest jacket I have ever owned. I live in a place with intense lake-effect snow and very high winds with wind chills that freeze cars into blocks of ice, and this coat actually leaves me over-heating slightly at times while out braving the elements.The only downside is how big and baggy the hood is. I know this is because it's space for a winter hat, but for when you're not wearing one, the hood just flaps and falls all over the place. It doesn't have drawstrings, unfortunately. When I'm walking in the wind, I'm usually holding the hood for dear life. It does have clasps that help hold it in place that cross a bit around my mouth but it's still pretty baggy after that. I know the answer is \"well, wear a hat\" but that's not always doable.Regardless of the hood, I have recommended this to so many people. I am always getting compliments on it and I am rarely cold (in the areas it covers, anyways). It might be too much for people in warmer climates, but if you're up north or somewhere with strong cold wind and low temps, absolutely look into this.",
