The hood is a bit too large and comes down over my eyes but I fix that with wearing a hat or beanie and it stays out of my face. I dont like the puffy plastic jackets and this having 100% cotton shell is perfect and its soft but feels very durable. Ilike that it is long enough to cover the bum but honestly wish they made a longer one that goes to the calf then Id have the best of both worlds with both jackets. The jacket does have weight to it but that is expected when its not all puffy plastic. It keeps me warm and dry here in the PNW and thats the best part. I recommend this jacket",

                "reviewText": "I am sooo happy I found this coat. After shopping at all the stores around me I couldn\u2019t find one that fit. I read reviews on all the coats on Amazon that I was interested in. Then BAM! I saw that there was a lady who had the same fitting problems I did and she loved her coat. I am short over weight and have short arms ( T Rex arms is what my girls call them) this coat fits perfect. I got a 3x and it was to big. I returned it and got a 2x (the original one was a pretty red but they didn\u2019t have it in the 2x so I got brown and it is actually a nice brown) . It fit true to size. It\u2019s not to long, the sleeves are still a bit long but , that\u2019s my life. The pockets are in a comfortable place too. I\u2019m only 4\u201910 so this is a big deal for me. It is SO warm. I live in the snow belt and it gets very cold. I\u2019m a freeze baby too. \ud83e\udd76This is going to be perfect, especially when taking the dog out and he takes forever. \ud83e\udd23 it\u2019s a warmer Christmas this year so I haven\u2019t worn it yet. If you don\u2019t mind the weight it is a heavy coat but super warm. I like the fact it has snaps as well as the zipper. I prefer a hood but for those who don\u2019t you can remove it. I definitely recommend this coat. Especially for a shorter gal like me. However it would fit great on anyone. Stay warm!! I know I will and Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84",

                "reviewText": "Very warm. The coat arrived squished into a plastic zipper bag and wrinkles from packaging/shipping were somewhat difficult to remove...it's not like you can easily iron it, but my steamer worked well. The coat is comfortable and kept me toasty warm in 20-degree weather. It's a bit bulky to carry on trips and it took up nearly half of my valuable suitcase space with the hood attached. The material will wrinkle, so perhaps not a great choice if you're choosing a coat for travel. I do love that both the hood and the fur trim on the hood are removable, as I don't always want the bulk of a hood, especially when in a car. My biggest complaint would be that the Sherpa on the inside sheds a bit onto your clothing, creating a light fuzz that stuck to my top underneath. I expect that issue will lessen with wear, but I would suggest using a Lint Roller on the lining before wearing it. Otherwise, this is a quality coat that is warm and attractive. I followed the size chart, and it suggested a size larger than I normally wear and it fit me perfectly by going up that one size, as suggested while wearing non-bulky tops. If you typically wear bulky sweaters/sweatshirts, or use multiple layers underneath, add another size, as it is a somewhat form-fitted design. I'm overall very happy with my purchase.",

I love all the features, the ribbed cuff to keep air from going up sleeves, the double closures, heavy zipper and snaps. In the car its nice to just snap the top leaving the zipper undone. The hood if great, detachable, warm faux fur and i love that it snaps over your face if you want. This coat is well thought out and worth every penny!So happy with it!",

It came wrapped in plastic but much to my horror when I took it out of the plastic to literally put it on my mom to wear it was dirty/dusty on the outside and had MANY pieces of hair on the inside liner. Gross. I told my mom I would return it and she said that\u2019s okay she didn\u2019t want to wait for another jacket to come in the mail. Bless her heart. I paid for a brand new jacket and got a used dirty one that looked like someone had picked it off the ground. So disappointed.",
