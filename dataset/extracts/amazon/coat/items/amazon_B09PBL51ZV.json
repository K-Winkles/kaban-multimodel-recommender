The hood does zip off.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a size up expecting it might run small. I\u2019m very glad I did because it just fit. The coat has a nice feel and has a little bit of weight, but isn\u2019t super heavy so much so that I feel like I can\u2019t move around. The exterior material is clearly wind, and waterproof. The hood is huge, but I like that, because it blocks out the wind and the fur around it helps to block snow from getting in your face. It does, however, limit visibility. The zipper seems to be of good quality, although it was very stiff when I first used it. I gave this four stars rather than five because it has buttons rather than snaps. This in and of itself wouldn\u2019t be an issue except the buttons are sewn on, and they don\u2019t seem to be very durable\u2026 I am confident I will lose the button shortly and will therefore need to reinforce them. The inside of the coat is warm and cozy And the cuffs are adjustable which is nice. They have the elastic band and the adjustable wind proof exterior so all in all the fit is small so definitely order up at least one size I am 5 ft 4 1/2 and weigh 275 pounds I typically wear a 3X or a size 22/24. I ordered this coat in a 4X and while it fits, I won\u2019t be wearing any hoodies or thick sweaters underneath it . Not really a concern because I could wear a tank top underneath this thing and it will keep me warm. Lol.",
