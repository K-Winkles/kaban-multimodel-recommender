                "reviewText": "As expected and as advertised!What we bought : Eddie Bauer Classic Down Heavyweight Jacket and we love it !Pluses : Great appearance, fun colors, warm but not a heavy weight and perfect fit. We got a size bigger for the age but check the measurements for your child (I have a taller kid and we wear a sweater under) Love the bright blue color, so I can actually spot my kid in a sea of grey jackets . No restrictions on movement, not a bulky fit , and the length is just right . The sleeves are perfect and have elastic cuffs. The jacket covers the lower back well but not too long so kids can be as active as they can. Sherpa lining is soft and cozy . Great call on the hood lining - it keeps kids warm when they lose the hat in school ( I\u2019m guessing we are not the only ones) We paired it with the same blue color snow pants from artix that comes w bib for those snowy winter days.We like that\u2019s this jacket versatile to be able to ski and tubing or just to walk to school ( gasp . Yes we walk a lot in Chicago winter no matter what weather and we strongly recommend it , yay for exercise, fresh air and oxygen for the brain) overall it\u2019s a cool, warm, affordable and washable jacket. (Machine wash ) good style that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s from the last century . We recommend it and Can\u2019t wait to wear it . Will update after this winter if lasted or if my kid killed it ... Huge plus of you buy it on sale as kids grow fast (always watch for Amazon deals) Hope this helps !",

This is a very warm coat with a hood that stays up! Not too heavy, but not so thin that I would worry about midwest winters. I\u2019m happy with the purchase!",
