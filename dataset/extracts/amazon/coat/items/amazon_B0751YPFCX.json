It is not snug at the shoulders and when I stretch out my arms it doesn\u2019t ride up my wrists. It is warm and comfortable. I was hesitant to but it because some reviews complained of the part behind the neck being bulky. I do not find that to be true. The hood isn\u2019t huge and falling into my face. Huge plus! Not to mention it\u2019s just a beautiful coat. I highly recommend!!",

Every time I put it on I have to pull the lining down as it bulks up and pulls the outside of the coat up. The lining is terrible. the coat is all uneven around the hem. Also when I zipper it, I have to hold the material back the whole way up as it catches on the material easily. I was busy and didn't try it on for a couple weeks so it was too late to return. I will wear it out while working outdoors at home (we have a business outdoors). Bad purchase!",

I purchased this one because my last one was just too heavy! So this one is good. It has deep pockets and a nice high collar so that the wind will not go down my neck when I take a walk. Another reviewer mentioned the zipper. I already have one coat with a less-than-ideal zipper so I am going to be careful with this one. I will probably merely step in and out of the coat to preserve wear and tear on the zipper. At present, I am very pleased with this coat and 100% satisfied with the purchase.",

It is lined with fleece and it has that purple piping inside the jacket which I didn't expect. The jacket is very warm and cozy and I like the length of the jacket. The cuffs are also lined with fleece. The jacket has nice generous deep pockets that you can put your wallet and phone. It also has lots of high quality gold detailing of buttons and hardware on the hood. Is a beautiful jacket overall! I couldn't be happier!!",
