I ordered a medium and usually wear a medium top. I did not want it oversized. Fits well enough to wear layers under but still loose. Only thing are pockets are set back a little too far and when used will be slightly tight.",

It\u2019s lined and warm but not too heavy. It\u2019s a loose fit so goes well over a turtleneck or light weight sweater. It\u2019s got side pockets which are a plus. The snap buttons are easy and look nice. Sizing is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, overall, I like this jacket. Its heavy, soft and I can tell itll be warm when weather gets cold. However, a few things I dislike about this particular one...it is very close to the listing image, but the brown is more of an unfortunate \"waste\" color than it is a nice, cozy, camel brown. It doesnt pair that well with the blue as a true camel brown would. The blue is also more faded than is shows in the listing. I think the blue would be close enough to what I wanted if the brown wasnt such an ugly color \ud83d\ude02 I added a close up of the colors in natural sunlight side-by-side with the listing photo.The jacket itself is comfortable. Lining is cheaper but soft. If you wash it frequently it'll likely matt and lose its softness. The outer jacket is a brushed flannel. Soft-ish, with a bit of scratchiness flannel sometimes has. Totally fine for outer fabric IMO. Jacket is heavy both in warmth and actual weight.. its about 3lbs. Good for layering over a tshirt in climates like mine where it can be 40 degrees in the morning and 75 degrees by noon in the fall.Sizewise, its really oversized. I bought the size recommended by Amazon on this listing, XL, and its a bit beyond the good oversized and into just being too big. Im 5'7\" and 155lbs. Definitely at least a size too big. I also wish it was a bit more drop-shoulder than it is...I think that would save it a little from being too big and would sit better for a true oversized look.Unfortunately between the size and the brown color I'll be returning this jacket. However, its nice enough I will reorder in a smaller size and a different color and hope for a better result because it really is comfortable and would be great to throw on to run errands, walk the dog etc etc.",
