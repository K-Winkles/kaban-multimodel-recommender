                "reviewText": "Worth every penny. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Zipper on my Colombia jacket of 10 yrs. Finally died. This was way cheaper. It performs the same! Super warm & soft! Fleece lining is a huge plus. Hood is not removable which is fine. Had a storm in Maine and cleaned and shoveled for 45 minutes in 17-23 degrees with flurries and I was not even a bit chilly. The coat isn\u2019t light and has some weight to it. If you\u2019re in Alaska I don\u2019t know if this works. It certainly does in Maine. Going to buy more colors and constantly look for price drops. I found the short version by Amazon for 15.00!!! Overstock price and I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s orange terracotta. Can walk outside with it for passing car visibility.I\u2019m a regular 3X but ordered up to a 4X to fit over winter clothing. I wore a thick hoodie this am and the jacket fit perfectly. Loose not tight at all.Pockets are phenomenal. There is a pocket inside on the left w. Velcro closure. My iPhone fits whole. The outside pockets have a zipper closure which rocks. Pocket size is just right not shallow at all.The arms are a bit longer on me but I don\u2019t care. I am 5\u20193. They have hand warming sleeves! You can just not wear them if not desired.",

I appreciate the hood on windy days and though the sleeve insert/extensions seem cheap and frilly, they actually work well to prevent cold air from coming up into your sleeves (much appreciated while shoveling snow). The zipper and snaps have held up well through wear and several washings. I've bought one in several colors and recommend them highly.",

It arrived as we were experiencing a big freeze, so I got to try it out straight away - it was nice and warm, and there was plenty of room for a sweatshirt and a puffy vest underneath.The only thing I would like better is if the hood could be adjusted.All in all, very happy with my purchase.",

As someone who doesn't deal with cold temps very well, this was a life saver (I live in OH). This puffer is thick, as heavyweight coats are supposed to be. The fleece inside is very comfortable and warm, keeping your upper body fully protected. It's important to say that there's no fleece inside the sleeves, which is understandable but apparently some people didn't know that. The hands details are a nice plus, which you can choose to wear or just tuck inside the sleeves around your wrists likenI do. I chose a large - 5'4\" 152lbs - in case I need to layer clothes.I really love how comfortable and warm this coat is and how it looks. I think it was a great purchase and worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "This jackets material is weak and if caught on something sharp or even a twig would rip it. I know the metallic color can be done without those things being its downfall. The look of the material is like it's old and a little dingey. Did I spell that correctly? Anyhow I didn't like the appearance. Then there's the fit. I'll admit my size nothing looks good on me in my perspective. Amazon said based on millions of reviews I should order a xxl. I ordered a XL. I'm 5 foot 4 and 195 and a large would have fit. I even ordered both sized XL in this and XXL in black. I didn't even bother trying on the other one. So I didn't like this metallic color. I've seen this metallic color puffer jacket at Walmart and they are pretty and that's what I expected this to look like but it was ugly. It fit like a big boxy tent. I did like the thing that is in the sleeves that your hands go into but when I didn't want to use them they were kind of loosely hanging over my hands getting in the way even after I thoroughly pushed them way back in the sleevesThe zippers seemed cheap and the stitching was iffy. . The hood was fine but this jacket might look cute if I wasn't so big in my upper body as I'm not used to this. I think a fitted jacket will please me more. I just want to say the material was not up to my expectations and the sizing is too large. I think a large might fit better not a xxl even though I wear XXL tops. I hope my review was thorough enough to help you make the right decision for the size and a warning about this metallic material.",

                "reviewText": "Last month, my winter coat was stolen (as well as several other things), and that same evening it started to snow and got really cold. Police and local agencies did nothing and offered no help, even when the temperature went to -40 and lower. Local stores here sell out of any plus size winter coats before winter really starts (and don't get re-stocked), so I decided to take a chance on a coat from Amazon. I'm so glad I took a chance!My experience over many years is that winter coats are sized at least three sizes too small, and the arms are usually even smaller, so imagine my shock to find this 6x (biggest available) is huge on me! It's really a 6x. Not a 3x or 2x labelled 6x.I've already recommended this coat to a relative, who's a large but ordered xl because she wants to be able to wear bulkier clothing under her coat even though I've told her she won't need extra layers. This coat is really warm, even in -45 weather, biting wind blowing while I'm wearing a t-shirt underneath.I like the big hood, the relaxed fit sleeves (the sleeves pull down and cover part of your hands), the pockets are So soft inside and zip shut, the zippers work well, this coat washed well at a laundrymat (I'm staying at a hotel at the moment) in a front loader, and dried on low heat in about 20 minutes. It still had a few damp patches around stitching, but I hung it up to dry overnight and it was totally dry the next morning.This coat is so warm, I actually start to sweat a bit at times, and I'm not doing anything particularly strenuous (not shovelling snow or running).This coat makes me feel like I'm wrapped in a hug, and the first time I put it on and zipped it up, I burst into tears. It feels that light and soft and good. It's much better than the coat that was stolen, and I'm so grateful Amazon delivered my new coat right to my hotel room. (I'd been stuck inside for over two weeks at that point because it was way too cold to go out). I'd never thought about getting a winter coat from Amazon, but I'm so glad I did, and I've been telling everyone about my lovely new puffy coat from Amazon :)",
