I\u2019m gonna order another color since you can\u2019t beat the price. I normally wear a medium and medium fits perfect with room. Also, sleeves are nice and long for those who need long arms.",

I put it on and while the sleeves are perfect and the length is great, the waste I could fit another me in there! I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to order a small tho, it will be snowing so I\u2019ll probably wear a hoodie and the jacket and it will be fine.
