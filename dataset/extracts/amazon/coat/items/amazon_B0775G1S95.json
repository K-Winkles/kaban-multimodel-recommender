                "reviewText": "I REALLY like this coat! I wanted a coat to wear hiking in the snow that was really warm without being too bulky and long enough to cover my behind but no so long as to get in the way of hiking. Check, check, check. This coat is really pretty - I got the Navy and it's perfect. It has a generously sized (maybe even a bit too large?) detachable fur lined hood and double closures up the front to keep in the heat. It also has long ribbed cuffs that come down my hands half-way, which I really like, and I have very long arms so it might cover your hands if you don't have really long arms. In most things I wear a Medium but I ordered a large based on reviews and it fits perfectly. Enough room to layer under it if needed, but I don't think I will - I was starting to sweat just trying it on and walking around in my air conditioned house lol. I love the strings on the sides, you can either tie across your waist like a belt or cinch up the sides and back and tie them off independently, which is what I did. That way the coat stays close to my body without the hassle of tying and untying it. I will say that I agree with the people saying the zipper is cheap. It feels far less study than the coat does, I'm going to wax it hoping that helps and just try to be careful since this is not a coat for every day, just for when I'm hiking in the snow. UPDATE: After 7+ days in freezing temps and back country snow hiking, this coat totally delivered. Super comfortable, kept me warm and dry in extended light rain and moderate to heavy snowfall, perfect length to keep me warm without getting in the way, lots of pockets and places to keep essentials out of the weather and within easy reach, and multiple ways to wear the hood depending on weather. The zipper did get sticky at times, I was afraid I would break it. I just made sure I was keeping the track taught and zipped very very slowly, it was fine. I am so glad I found this jacket, it was a lifesaver on my trip!",

The lower side snap openings are a nice addition for added comfort when sitting (I wish more coats would incorporate this functionality.) My one big issue is the zipper. It is a 2-way zip, which I always look for, but it's a cheap nylon zipper. A couple of weeks ago the stupid thing broke...right when the temp with wind chill dropped to below zero. Whatever warmth I would have gotten from a nicely zipped coat was lost due to the open coat flapping in the wind. Now I need to find someone to replace the cheap zipper with a good quality metal zipper. Meanwhile, I have to find another coat to wear while this one gets repaired. You really can't over stress how important a quality zipper is for a winter coat.",
