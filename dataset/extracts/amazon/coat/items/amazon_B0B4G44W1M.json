It looks so sophisticated though, even in the larger size, although it\u2019s not as slimming since I sized up.",

                "reviewText": "I recently acquired the Women's Classic Coat Lapel Collar Open Front Coat, and while it does provide warmth, I must admit that it falls short of my personal style preferences. From my perspective, it bears a resemblance to a bathrobe, which is not the look I was aiming for. In terms of functionality, this coat does deliver on its promise of warmth. The lapel collar and open front design provide ample coverage during chilly weather, making it suitable for colder climates. The material used is reasonably cozy, ensuring comfort during wear.However, when it comes to aesthetics, this coat did not meet my expectations. The design, while intended to be classic, unfortunately, lacks the elegance and sophistication I had hoped for. The resemblance to a bathrobe is a significant drawback for me, as I was seeking a more tailored and stylish outerwear option.Nonetheless, it is essential to note that style is subjective, and others may find this coat more appealing. If you prioritize warmth over style, and if the bathrobe resemblance is not a concern for you, this coat may still be a viable option. However, if you are looking for a more refined and fashionable outerwear piece, I would recommend exploring alternative options that align better with personal style preferences.",

It is so versatile and goes with everything. The pockets on the outside are nice and deep to carry all your stuff! There are no secret pockets on the inside. It\u2019s just a very well made coat and looks so amazing!! Highly recommend. Worth every penny!!!",
