Yes, the arms were a tiny bit long, but not a problem and probably not long enough to roll up. I didn't find the lower edge on the center to ride up (as pictured)\u2026.it is straight across. It's pretty light-weight, with the upper core area being lined with fleece. Works perfectly for California rain. If you need this for freezing rain, you would have to bundle another layer underneath, which is easy, as the style is relaxed and roomy. Good purchase.",
