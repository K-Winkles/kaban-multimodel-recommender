                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this cardigan. It has almost a peacoat kind of quality about it, but it's a lighter fabric. It's very comfortable and it can easily \"dress up\" a casual outfit without looking too posh. I like it so much that I ordered another one in a different color!Pros1) Very comfortable2) It's lightweight but will keep you warm in cold weather3) Nice, tight weave4) Appears more expensive than it isCons1) If you're petite, the sleeves are a bit too long",

It has a good amount of structure and weight and is a thick, close-knit material that has plenty of give to move freely. Fits very well. Not quite enough fabric to pull it closed, but it looks quite nice worn open which gives a long, vertical line. I'm 5'5\" 155lbs 36DD athletic build with broad shoulders, long arms and I ordered a Large. I think I would be swimming if I sized up. I ordered the brown- I was really hoping it was a cool brown for my color palette, but it is a warm brown \ud83e\udd0e It's close enough to work for me. I will be ordering in other colors. I haven't worn or washed it yet. I'm really hoping it holds up, but that's the trade-off with knits so we'll see. I plan to wear it around the house or running errands to feel comfy and chic. I would even wear it to work or for an interview. It's that nice! If you want to do the elevated classic trend like blazers or long coats- but still be cozy- this is it!",
