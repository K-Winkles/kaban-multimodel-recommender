Slightly big, but its perfect to layer sweaters in it since we live in area where it does get really cold!We chose the pink color, and it receives numerous compliments. Additionally, it provides excellent warmth. The inclusion of glove holes for the thumb is another feature that I appreciate. Great price too! Amazon essentials for the win!",

The coats are holding up well to 9 degrees!Once I saw them, I bought an XXLarge size for myself. It fits perfectly, for anyone else who wears small or medium petite. Mine's golden yellow. My daughter wanted me to have pink to match hers.The only thing I could wish to change on these coats is to add a drawstring for the hood, because it's too loose, even with the snap.",
