The exchange process for an XL was easy as it always is with prime. The larger size fits perfectly (XL). It's roomy enough for multiple layers underneath but still maintains its shape, so you don't feel like you're wearing a bulky blanket or look like the \"Michelin Man\" . Performance-wise, this jacket is great. It has kept me warm and dry. The insulation is effective without being overly heavy. I've been out in snow and light rain, and the waterproofing holds up. It's exactly what you need for a cold or snowy winter day.I noticed some reviews mentioned issues with the zipper, but I've had no such problems.There's ample space for your phone, ski pass, wallet, and even small snacks.Value for Money is great , I would recommend it to a friend or even buy again.",

                "reviewText": "My apologies, as this coat is a rich black color, however due to the lighting in the room you can\u2019t tell. This was a gift to my husband, as we live in the northern US where we are deep in snow. First off, this coat is a medium weight, and the inside is all soft fur. Even the hoodie is lined with fur, which worked excellent in keeping his head/neck/mouth area covered from the cold. It was roomy with a Velcro strap to keep it snug, and it is wide enough that it covers the top of the jacket when zipped. There are 3 sets of pockets: down on the side, one on the chest and one inside the jacket. This is great, as you don\u2019t always get a secure inside pocket to tuck away your wallet, keys, money, etc. The size shown is an XX-Large and is a good length in which it would cover down beneath the bum. My husband went out to snow blow wearing a long-sleeve t-shirt and this jacket. He was surprised that it kept him warm, as we were getting snow drifts from the wind. He is pretty thin and he was surprised he didn\u2019t get cold at all. We had a bit of rain a week later, which this jacket did great at repelling water. The cuffs on the sleeve are adjustable, and the coat also has small pull straps to tighten the hoodie around your face. This jacket will surprise you \u2013 it has the quality of a more expensive jacket but is affordable for most to buy. You can\u2019t go wrong with this jacket!",

                "reviewText": "So I actually bought this jacket with a different purpose in mind rather than for skiing. I am an athletic trainer and during the late fall, winter, and spring seasons, I am covering all different sports in all different kinds of weather because I am in a four seasons state. The first thing I did when I opened up this jacket was run it under a faucet and make sure waterproof meant waterproof and not water resistant. I can safely say this jacket served its purpose for me more than well. In pouring, freezing rain or snow or sleet, it kept my torso completely warm and dry. It fits very well and is comfortable to wear. On days when I want it for warmth and am not concerned about the weather, I just take the hood off. All the pockets have zippers so I don't have to worry about losing anything or my items getting wet. I definitely would recommend this jacket to any other fellow ATs or people that are forced to stand outside for hours in the pouring, cold, rain.",

                "reviewText": "Price is great for what you get. First let me say I really like this jacket a lot. The jacket is great looking. Had lots of compliments from other men, asked me where I got it. The lining is warm and the coat is great in the rain and the length is perfect, I am 5' 9\" 180 pounds I bought a size large, and it covers right to the bottom of my butt cheeks, keeping my butt dry and warm. I love the coat. It also has a removal zippered hood so you don't have to have it hanging there all the time when it's not need in warmer weather, etc. But, it will require two changes to the design to make this a perfect coat for me. #1 It needs some velcro closures on the zipper flaps to keep it closed. Yes there are two snaps, at the top and bottom of flaps, but if you're wearing gloves they are tough to deal with, and even when buttoned, snow and air could possibly sneak under the flap. Velcro would be a quick and easy way to secure the zipper flap. #2 It needs a double zipper. Because of the length of the jacket, butt cheeks covered, I have to fully unzip it when I sit down in the car, etc. I usually \"hike-it up\" and leave it zippered but it would be more comfortable if it had a double zipper which would allow me to just unzip a few inches from the bottom. It would also make it easier to get my hands into my pants pockets as well.So bottom line: If you need a warm waterproof great looking great fitting almost perfectly designed jacket, I highly recommend this one.",

This jacket checks all the boxes. It's comfy, warm, durable (well so far), looks good, and holds up nicely against the elements. I highly recommend these. Oh yeah almost forgot: I'm 6 feet tall, slender built, 175 pounds, and I purchased the size medium. I do wish they were an inch or two longer to fully cover my butt but I'm quite fine with the current length. I doubt the large would've made much of a difference anyway based on the dimensions provided on the website.",
