The lining in the jacket and hood is so soft and cozy. There are plenty of pockets, including an inside one. They secure for extra protection to not lose keys or phone. There is extra wind break over the zipper with button closure. I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend this jacket. I'm short 5'4\" and the length is perfect, the pockets aren't so far down I have to bend over to reach into them.The hood has drawstring to keep weather out and the waist can be drawn in as well.
