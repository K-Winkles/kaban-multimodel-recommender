Decided to send that back and put the money towards something I had wanted for a while...a real London Fog. I was not dissapointed, this coat immediately enhanced my self-image, made me look classy and sexy, and I get almost daily compliments. It's casual enough to wear out for a day of shopping, classy enough for work in a corporate office, and sexy enough for date night. It's a timeless, good quality, trusted brand name coat. Order a size smaller than you usually would, especially if you are below 5'4. Sleeves will be too long otherwise.",

I am a bit busty (40DDD) and am always worried that online clothing purchases will be too tight. This coat is just right at an XL. Plenty of room to button up if needed without feeling too baggy, but I likely will wear it open most of the time. Also it is water proof. I noticed many others made no mention of water repellent or water proof features. I mean, if it rain and this coat can't handle it that would be odd. Overall, a great buy for the price and sure to last a long time.",

The belt is very long to make sure you can tie it up properly!! I'm so happy!! I've been wearing a London Fog coat for years! It was my late mother-in-law's coat she left to me! It's 10year old and still in great shape!!",

                "reviewText": "This is a treat for find on Amazon as I had one years ago and was disappointed when it no longer fit. The fit is a bit boxier than with some trench coats. The fabric and lining are high quality. The coat is well made as per the quality one expects with the London Fog company. Even my grandmother would rave about London Fog coats many years ago. I am keeping the 1X and returning the 2X. I am disappointed that the 2X is $50 more and I would appreciate a discount from the company.The length is good for a professional look as it provides good coverage when getting in and out of vehicles. I chose the black for durability in bad weather (and occasional coffee spills...). The beige is lovely on some people but the upkeep dissuades me from the beige. The black is a deep black and not faded in appearance. I would highly recommend this coat. It is a workhorse piece that will last many years.",
