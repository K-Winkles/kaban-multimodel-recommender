I was willing to upsize it, but as with all of the clothing made Internationally, at least Asia, there is no size between an XL and an XXL. An XL is normally a 16 and an XXL is a 22/24. So there is too much disparity. An XXL is way too large! So that is why I will no longer trust an XL because it is like a 14/16.",

Le probl\u00e8me du produit c\u2019est que la photo du manteau sur Amazon n\u2019est pas du tout r\u00e9aliste, \u00e7a ressemble vraiment \u00e0 un manteau d\u2019hiver \u00e9pais et vous le dites bien dans votre annonce.( Mat\u00e9riau de qualit\u00e9 : le tissu ext\u00e9rieur est en cuir floqu\u00e9. Le manteau d'hiver pour femme est dot\u00e9 d'une doublure sherpa \u00e9paisse. )Mais en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c\u2019est tr\u00e8s mince et plut\u00f4t l\u2019apparence d\u2019un pull d\u2019automne. J\u2019aurais due aller lire les commentaires avant d\u2019acheter parce que la plupart des gens disent comme moi, c\u2019est mon erreur je suis aller ce matin les lire. Alors oubliez ma r\u00e9clamation \u00e7a ne vaut pas le coup pour $35.00 mais penser que sur Amazon il y a des gens de Pays froid qui ach\u00e8te et ce n\u2019est vraiment pas des v\u00eatements d\u2019hiver pour porter au Canada. Merci quand m\u00eame pour votre r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ma demande.",

There is no quality control, I can't imagine how they sell a 3x in 2 different sizes and 2 different lengths and different quality garment . The US 3x is a superior quality by far! So is at your own risk! I wear a size xl in US but I ordered 3x as the measurements in their chart showed I would be that size. 3 fit and 2 were very large but a better quality.
