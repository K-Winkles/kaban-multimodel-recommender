Believe I could have bought the small. I washed and dried the medium in hot temperatures hoping it would shrink. It may have just a little, not enough. It's still too big, but looks fine. I do like the pockets, the cut is flattering and the material is light weight for those of us who get overheated at work. I'd order this coat again. Just next time I'll order a small.",

Fit was slightly larger than expected, but I purchased a larger size for a more comfortable fit over light weight sweaters.The most disappointing factor with this lab coat is that it clearly requires ironing after laundering. Many, if not most, of the other Cherokee products launder much better. If you hate ironing (like me), then pass this one up. I have two other lab coats made by LA Rose that are well over a year old and still don't require ironing, so this was a disappointment.",

In many things I am like a 1X or 2X but I saw a lot of others saying it\u2019s a bigger than expected so that\u2019s why I hit an XL and I was hoping it would fit because in any order store I would never really fit into an XL but it fit really good not tight at all, but if I truly thought I was an XL it would have definitely been bigger then expected",
