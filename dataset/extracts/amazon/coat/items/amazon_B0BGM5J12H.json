It is reversible, but he has only wore it one way (with the fleece inside). It fit perfect! Quality seems great so far. I wash it weekly, and so far so good. It has zipper pockets which we both love. He keeps up with his gloves better that way. So that makes us both happy! Would definitely purchase again!",

                "reviewText": "As a parent, I am always looking for high-quality, versatile clothing options for my child, and this puffer coat definitely fits the bill. First, the coat is incredibly well-made with high-quality materials. The waterproof outer layer provides excellent protection from the elements, while the faux shearling lining provides warmth and comfort. The lightweight puffer design is great too as my son doesn't like heavy coats. Second, the coat is reversible, providing two different style options in one. The solid color on one side and the pattern on the other side make it easy to create a different outfit, which is great for parents who want to simplify their kids' wardrobe. My son says that the non furry side is also great when you're active outside as it allows you to keep warm without overheating. Third, the coat is very easy to care for. It is machine washable and maintains its shape and color after washing, which is essential for busy parents.Overall, I am extremely satisfied and would highly recommend it to any parent looking for a high-quality, versatile coat for their child. It is well-made, functional, stylish, and easy to care for, making it a great investment for any family. Five stars!",

                "reviewText": "My 11.5 y/o son is thin and amongst the smallest kids in his class. I would've normally ordered size 10-12, but since we live in Southern CA and don't need a warm jacket all that often, and his skinny arms are pretty long, I decided to order the next size up. Unfortunately, 12-14 wasn't available so I went for 14-16, thinking that even if he will have a major growth spurt it will fit next winter, or perhaps the one after. I assumed it will be huge. Wrong!!! Size 14-16 fits my slight boy perfectly, and the kid who normally has zero interest in clothes fell in love with this one the moment he saw it.The jacket is VERY nice indeed - so warm and soft on the inside, and waterproof on the outside. The hood is the perfect size as well.Really happy with this purchase and I'm now going to see if Eddie Bauer makes the same in adult sizes. I want one for myself!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a size 10-12 for my 10 year old boy. The size on the tag when it arrived was Medium and it was too small. The color listed was Dark Waters but the color on the tag said Princess Blue (color name doesn\u2019t matter though) I returned it and for the size 14 and it fits. Other than that it\u2019s light weight and warm and I like that it\u2019s reversible",

                "reviewText": "We live in a humid climate with only a few months when temp drops below freezing. So finding a durable, warm jacket with a hood was impossible. My son is picky with textures and design, but LOVED the jacket. Super soft. It's lined with the soft faux shearling through arms and hood. Most soft linings don't extend to sleeves and hood. Runs true to size. And the price was reasonable. Very happy with purchase :)",
