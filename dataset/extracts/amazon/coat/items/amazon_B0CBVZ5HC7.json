She said it keeps her very warm outside in the freezing cold as the faux fur lining is toasty and warm without having to wear bulky layers underneath, plus she loves the titanium color since it looks different shades, depending on the light it could look silver or a dark shade of grey. Some people may not like the color changing effect but she does! I tried it on and it is a warm and cute coat, may get one for myself in a different color! Great purchase!",

The inside fur like material is very soft and warm and trapps heat in very well and the material extends into the hood but not down the sleeves. It's perfect for temperature 40\u00b0 and below. (Currently it's in the 20s and 30s and dipping into the teens here in nyc with snow) In my opinion, it traps heat so well that it might be too much for temperature in the 50s or above. I was Afraid it would be too light weight but it's a good amount of thickness while still keeping out the cold. It's comfortable where u don't feel stiff and can move arms just fine. I will definitely get on for my daughter",

It sheds like crazy on your clothes, and acts almost like a velcro on your backside, making it creep up and hard to pull down to cover your bum! The hood is also massive, and turns in-side out on it's own. Will be returning. :(",
