                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re thinking about getting this one, do it! I wanted something stylish to take with me on vacation to a cooler climate area and found this gem. It was on sale at the time, so I snagged it up. I received it on time. It looks just like the photo, if not better. The quality of the outer material is great! Sewn, not printed, and gives it a nicer quality appearance. The details from the belts on the sleeve to the collar is beautiful. The lining material is a bit on the cheaper side, but keeps warm. You can\u2019t see that, and I usually wear long sleeve if I\u2019m wearing a coat or jacket anyway, so doesn\u2019t bother me. The only con for me is that the arms are a bit short for me, but I have an above average wingspan so it\u2019s nothing new to me. I\u2019m still keeping because it\u2019s not that short and noticeable. I\u2019ll try to get picks and update once I\u2019ve worn it.",

                "reviewText": "I like the look of the coat, on the models of course. Not so much how it looks on me. I ordered a 2xl and it just does fit and will just button. Unfortunately when being designed for larger women they did not account for a wider hip, so the skirt portion is slightly shorter rides just on the hip and makes me look bigger, despite the fact that black has a slimming effect. If I fully button the way it is intended to be worn, it is not flattering at all. I always look over size guides when ordering and the 2xl should have afforded me a little more room than it did.There is some room for improvement with this coat for sure. There is only a single loop for the belt, that is directly in the middle of the back. So you either have to tie it, or remove it as it will drag the ground otherwise. Ig there were additional loops on the sides as well you could loop through keep the belt with the coat without needing to tie it every time. For larger or plus size a little more length to the skirted area or less pleating would be a more flattering look overall.The collar could use a bit of improvement as well, perhaps a different material completely. The faux fur is the type that you cannot dry, so expect to be dry cleaning or spot cleaning your coat rather than being able to launder as you normally would. If you run it through the dryer the collar will melt and mat.Get yourself a lint roller you will need one. The coat attracts everything, lint, pet hair and more. So before heading out I have to run a lint roller over it. One of my buttons is a tad stiff to use, like the button hole is slightly smaller than it should be I can still button it but I do have to really shove it through.Do I recommend it? Not for anyone with large set hips, if you are not plus size it likely will do well for you! I did give it 4 stars because it is very warm, and a good coat to keep warm during winter. It just was not as flattering a cut as I hoped it would be. A good value for the cost it will keep you warm the coat itself is a very heavy material and even walking my dogs in -10 degrees I still stay very warm. I would love to see some improvements and larger more accurate sizes for plus size in this coat.",

I probably should have ordered a large. The coats are sized correctly but I was still worried and ordered big. I am returning the XXL and keeping the XL because I was able to tighten the fit. I love holiday coats and wearing to the theater or out for dinner with friends. This coat is well made and priced decent. I was especially happy about the Prime fast shipping. The only complaint I have is the lack of side loops for the belt. The belt only has one loop on the back of coat, so the belt drags on the ground when not tied. I am adding side loops to hold belt in place. Otherwise I am very happy!",
