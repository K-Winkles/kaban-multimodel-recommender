It can stimulate children's interest in scientific activities to the greatest extent and satisfy children's desire to explore. Conducting small science experiments can increase children's interest in science while cultivating their hands-on ability \"Knowledge comes from actions, not from objects.\" Therefore, guiding young children to conduct small scientific experiments is the best way to acquire scientific knowledge. In the small experiment, the children not only have fun, but also easily learn the knowledge that the teacher asks them to master. Scientific experiments can develop children's hand-eye coordination ability, promote the development of small muscles, exercise children's divergent thinking, hands-on ability, brain-moving ability, and language development ability.",
