I usually wear a Medium, but I ended up switching it for a small.The only point of critique I have (since the deduction of 1 star) is the odd odor that comes with the jacket. I left it hanging for a while, and wiped it down before wear, but it had this fish-like smell the entire time.",

I'm usually a size XL, so I ordered the XXL to be safe and it's perfect..not too baggy but perfectly oversized. I probably could've done the XL and it would've been fine too. Doesn't feel cheap and plasticy either, definitely recommend buying!",

I\u2019m very satisfied with this purchase! I love how basic and comfy this jacket is and it fits me very well. I normally wear an XS in tops but wanted an oversized fit. A medium fit me perfectly. I would recommend this if someone wanted a leather jacket but didn\u2019t care about quality because I have been seeing a few loose strings and I\u2019ve only worn it a handful of times.Many people mention the weird smell it comes with but it smelled like regular shipping smell to me. There wasn\u2019t anything fishy about it and it went away after a few days of it being aired out. Nothing to worry about as long as you give it time to go away!",
