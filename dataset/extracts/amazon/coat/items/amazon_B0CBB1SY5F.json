If you want to have a lot of room in this and have a baggier look, you can still cinch it at the bottom if that is your preference. However, for me I have a smaller chest (32B) and it just looks like an oversized ,extra-wide rectangle on me. It\u2019s definitely comfy\u2026but not very flattering at all. Returned.",
