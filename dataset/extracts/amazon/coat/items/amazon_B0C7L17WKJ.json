I wanted to wear it for an event so I ordered both a SM & MED. It's a relaxed fit so I kept the SM and it fits me exactly as pictured! It's a nice weight and perhaps the WARMEST coat I own! Seriously, you can feel the heat the minute you slip it on! The sleeves are nice and long and I LOVES me some pockets!!A snap, button, or hook in front for closure would catapult this compliment provoking jacket beyond perfection!",

So, a gentle brush and blow dryer, problem solved. I brushed upward while blow drying careful not to heat too much. It's now perfect and fluffy no creases or wrinkles in the fur. I ordered large, 5'6\" at 170lb and it's a good fit, I'm larger up top and wide waist. Would be able to add a closure if I wanted to. Apricot is really Ivory color, neutral and nice.",

The jacket itself seems like it wouldn\u2019t keep you warm but it kept me very warm in below freezing temperatures. It\u2019s so cute and can be styled in many ways. Highly recommend!! It\u2019s worth the money! And the inside is silky!",

                "reviewText": "Wooooowww this jacket is DOPE! Better quality than I expected for the price! It's super soft and the fur lays beautifully. Runs true to size, although I have long arms so take that as you will. Color is true to product photos. The lining is really nice and I'm picky about anything that sits on my skin. It's synthetic obviously but it seems like it would breathe well. It's heavier than I thought but not heavy enough to wear in the cold cold. But I live in Texas so I'm sure I'll get plenty of use out of it. Bought it for a costume but I will definitely be wearing it in real life! Only thing is there isn't a closure of any kind which is my bad for not noticing in the photos. I may attach a button or something. Overall I'm very impressed - I can't wait for it to be cold enough to wear out!",
