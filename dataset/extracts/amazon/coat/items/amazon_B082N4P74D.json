From the pictures I thought the buttons would look cheap but in person they are actually very nice and look much darker than in the pictures. Overall great purchase, looks very chic and it\u2019s actually warm. The pictures don\u2019t do it justice. If you\u2019re thinking about it\u2026.. order it. For perspective I\u2019m 5\u20195, 220 and ordered a XL which is my usual size in coats. It sits right above my ankles.",

                "reviewText": "This Amazon London Fog store is genuine; it does not sell fakes. I know London Fog products well, having bought many for years. This coat is the real deal. Do not hesitate to buy. I just got mine in black, size medium. It arrived in 3 days. I normally order from the manufacturer's own website, but they were out of black maxi trenches. They have this one in a lovely rose color that is tempting, but I wanted black. I had to replace my 8-year-old London Fog Juliet coat that I accidently scorched while pressing. I also tore my 6-year-old tan Sophie coat. Bad luck! Sad face! :-( Those coats had plaid felt zip-out warmers which were nice. Unfortunately, London Fog retired the styles with warmers. The quality of this exterior shell and the details are the same as before. The material resembles shiny black silk trench coats from high end manufacturers. This is not a cheap look; do not pay attention to the naysayers. I usually wear US size 10-12, and I am 5 feet 6 inches. The medium fits just fine with sweaters underneath, although I would not wear my bulkiest one. There is more room in the arms and shoulders than my old Juliet coat, probably because the lining is black satin and no warmer to take up extra room. The length is about 3/4 of my height. It does not reach the ground and no hemming is necessary. I hope London Fog stays in business because I love their coats. They had some financial difficulties during the pandemic, and I hope they recover fully to stay in business.",

Bei meiner Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von 1,64 m ist mir der Mantel bis an die Kn\u00f6chel gegangen, ich habe ihn nun zum K\u00fcrzen zum Schneider gebracht. Das K\u00fcrzen kostet ca. 2/3 von dem, was der Mantel urspr\u00fcnglich kostete, aber das ist ja klar: die Qualit\u00e4t ist derart hochwertig, dass auch eine \u00c4nderung aufwendig ist, weil es eben nicht nur eine Naht ist, die ge\u00e4ndert werden muss. Auch wenn der Mantel dadurch wesentlich teurer am Ende ist: er ist es wert. Sehr zufrieden mit meinem Kauf!",

                "reviewText": "This is a nicely weighted coat. The outer shell is a cotton-polyester mix. With a satin-twill lining, in a light blue colour.At 5.3\" this trench coat is long on me, from the hem to the floor there is a clearance of apx 16cm.The sleeves are also long which is great, as I thought they looked a little short on the model.The coat also has a rather long belt, at apx 175cm; I can wrap it around myself twice or attempt those fancy belt tying techniques. The belt also has a cleverly hidden fastening, which means the belt will never accidentally slide out of the loops.As for the hood, I would describe it as adequate. If you have lots of hair as I do, you'll need an umbrella if caught in a shower as it doesn't quite cover my head. However, if I'm feeling a bit noir I may just wear a scarf.All in all, I'm very happy with this coat as I wanted a maxi-length trench. So, for me, this is perfect for both Spring and Autumn.",
