The Lead Dentist liked my wife's so much that I ordered one for her as well. Overall, great product, and the price is well below the high quality of manufacturing.",

This is the first time in 20 years I've had a lab coat fit that wasn't custom made.The floral detailing is a cute touch. Been getting compliments on just how a properly fitted coat has elevated my look to be more professional. I think I'm even carrying myself different. It's been a good confidence booster.Will more likely be sticking with this brand from now on.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time buying this brand and I'm glad I did. I am 5'2\" and 110 lbs with a slim build. I find that most white coats are too big on me, and have spent years finding a brand that offers a good fit and good construction. I previously bought another brand (Adar) which fits great but fell apart after a few washes. This coat by Koi is made well and fits nicely especially with the sewn down waistband hitting above my hips (makes me appear taller). I also love the contrast fabric and the little button on the inside of the coat that allows me to button down the flap. All in all I am happy with my purchase and planning on wearing it first day of clinic next week. I really hope that this jacket will last me a long time and will update my review after several months of wear.",

The medium was tight in shoulder and bust but perfect in the waist. I wore it anyways with the chest buttons open and waist buttons closed Then I bought a large. The large fit my bust but the shoulders were still tight- restrictive in raising my arms. Also the waist was too wide! I still wear it, but open. I think this would fit better on a stick figure. I should have returned them but they were so cute!",
