                "reviewText": "I just received the jacket and it's hard to believe how nice it is for what it cost. I would guess a jacket like this would cost $250 or more at a posh store. I'm 6', 185 and the Large was a tad bit big so I returned and got a Medium - fits perfect. Most of the time I wear a Large, so I suggest the sizes might run on the generous side. Check your measurements.The Large I originally purchased was Coffee (medium-thick), I like the color but it looked a little too \"Sherlock Holmes\" for my taste. Went with the Army Green for the Medium and am very happy with it.The Jacket looks great, I don't think I've been more impressed from buying clothing on Amazon. I haven't worn it for a full day yet, but will in soon. I'll see how it holds up - who knows, it may completely unravel, but I highly doubt it. Really seems to be well made.",

Wasn't even too wrinkled, although I'll probably get it dry cleaned just to see it at its best. I almost ordered a Large, but sized up to an Extra Large after reading some comments. Glad I did--no way the Large would have worked for me. Even the XL is a bit tight across my chest. I wouldn't wear a suit jacket underneath it, but I have other coats for that so not an issue. It's quite a bit shorter than I expected, but I don't mind that other than the hand warmer pockets are placed a bit high, though not uncomfortable. Overall, it's a fantastic value and I'm happy with it! If I did it over again, the XXL may have been a better fit for me, but I worry it would possibly be too loose in the waist and only resolve the slightly tight chest fit issue. I'm happy enough and keeping it!",

                "reviewText": "The Wantdo Men's Wool Blend Jacket is a decent choice for those seeking style and some protection from the elements. Here's my take after giving it a spin:Classic Design: The pea coat design is timeless, and it's a versatile piece that complements both formal and casual attire.Windproof Features: It does provide some protection against the wind, making it suitable for moderately chilly days.Comfortable Collar: The stand collar adds a touch of elegance and provides extra coverage against cold winds.Affordable: This jacket offers a budget-friendly alternative to high-end pea coats without compromising too much on quality.Sizing Uncertainty: Sizing seems to be a common issue, with some users experiencing a fit that's less than perfect. Be sure to refer to the size chart diligently before ordering.Limited Warmth: While it's reasonably warm, it may not be the best option for extremely cold conditions, as it lacks the robust insulation of more expensive wool coats.Durability Concerns: Some users have reported issues with the durability of the jacket, particularly with buttons coming loose.In conclusion, the Wantdo Men's Wool Blend Jacket is a reasonable choice for those who want to stay stylish while dealing with moderate cold. However, it may not be the warmest or most durable option on the market. Three stars for its balance of style and practicality.",

Is it going to handle sub zero weather? Maybe not, but 32 degree weather it stood up. Pockets are deep, deeper than I thought they would be. The collar, it can be as snug as you wish. You have various options to close it up. Zipper for cool, buttons for cold, zipper and buttons for very cold. Not rain proof but that was a given, but it did protect me in the rain nicely.

At first I ordered an XL in Navy because that\u2019s what he always wears but I tried it on & it was too tight so I knew it wouldn\u2019t fit him. I had to send the Navy back & order a 2XL in Black which fit better! The first one wasn\u2019t true to size so watch that!",
