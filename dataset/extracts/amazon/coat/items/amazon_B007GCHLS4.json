The sleeves are like 3/4 length which is good for reaching over a Bunsen burner lol I even rolled mine once/cuffed them to make it look nicer. Highly recommend for the price point. Loves it",

                "reviewText": "The material is lightweight, and has a very subtle shimmery appearance that makes it stand out from typical lab coats that make me look and feel like I'm wearing a coat made out of a white bed sheet. I feel like the material makes it look nicer and more professional. The pockets are spacious and one of them has multiple compartments. The best thing is it doesn't wrinkle in the dryer - it comes out looking brand new and completely wrinkle free! This is an important factor for me and I was pleasantly surprised by that.The size seems to run big; I am normally an XS but this XS seems pretty big. I like that I can tighten it in the back, but I had to tighten it all the way, which causes folding in the back. The upper arm sleeves also seem to be disproportionately big.But overall I love the coat; the shape fits nicely, the length is perfect, and it is flattering overall.",

Most of the pockets are great. The only change I would make is to remove the middle stitching on the outer right pocket. To me, that makes the pocket unusable. Not sure why it is designed that way. I do recommend this because it is comfortable and flattering and I love the small pocket on the right that fits business cards perfectly.",

Pockets are perfect & are divided in layers on the R side, which is great to store my pens, sanitizer, and lightweight equipment (such as penlight or scissors). I use the left single pocket for personal items. Comfortable for my neck. This is by far my favorite lab coat in all my 11 years of wearing lab coats. I wish they made all lab coats like this, as I feel like standard lab coats are made of really stiff thick material and tend to yank down on the back of my neck.",

                "reviewText": "This lab coat has a very cute design; however it is too sheer. I ordered it in white and in black. I followed the sizing guide and ordered a medium and a large, a small would have been just right, even though the chart suggested medium and reviews said size up. I would suggest getting your usual size. The white was just too sheer, my preference is a no show fabric. Fabric on this is very crinkled and not very stretchy as advertised, I liked that is was compatible with the design and actually looks quite nice. The sleeve length was longer than expected in both sizes, which was suitable for me as I wear longer length gloves that cover just above the wrist for added protection. I give it 3 stars because of the misleading fit guide and the sheerness of the white version. I exchanged for a size small in black.",
