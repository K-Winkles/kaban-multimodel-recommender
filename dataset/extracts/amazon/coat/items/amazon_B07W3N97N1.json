                "reviewText": "I LOVE THIS JACKET!!! The quality is excellent, and the seam work is exceptional. The color I chose is light blue and it is very vibrant! The inside of the jacket and hood are lined in soft fluff type material that feels like fur. When zipped, the jacket has about 1 inch overlap that covers the zipper keeping the cold from getting in. The hood is roomy and I was able to wear my snow cap and cover my head with it. It has a Velcro strap that when the jacket is zipped all the way up, the strap is wide enough it covers the top of your jacket/neck area. I went out to snow blow and the strap not only kept the cold out of the top of my jacket, but it also kept my neck, chin, and mouth warm. I love the front zip pocket on the chest, but even more the inside zip pocket. It\u2019s hard to find a jacket that offers this, as I don\u2019t always carry a purse or backpack. I like to take my wallet, phone or keys and put them inside where they are secure. Such a great feature! The cuffs are adjustable, so you can keep the cold from getting into the sleeves. With snow comes wetness, and this jacket did not disappoint with its ability to not only keep me warm but dry. The photo shows a size XX-Large which fit snug. I don\u2019t think I could wear a thick sweater with it, however I did go out to plow in a long sleeve t-shirt and had no issues with keeping warm. I love that this jacket is functional, well made and the quality is superb. Having owned big name winter jackets, I have to they have met their match \u2013 not only on quality but affordability!",

The fur lining on the inside is a nice touch as well.There is a pocket on the inside that is perfect for keeping small items. I used it to store feminine products and some other items. The outside pocket is ideal for storing chapstick, AirPods, and anything else you want immediate access to. All the pockets have zippers, too.I will be using this again to go skiing in a few weeks. I'll post updates :)",

                "reviewText": "I had the same winter coat for a many years until it finally fell apart.After a lot of looking I purchased this coat last year and absolutely loved it. It seemed to be excellent quality and the XL fit me pretty well except for being a little tight at the bottom but once it was zipped up and pulled down over my hips it was never an issue.My keys did snag the stitching on one of the pockets causing it to easily become un stitched from the inside the first month but that was a fairly easy sewing job to repair it.Otherwise it kept me toasty warm and completely dry all of last winter, way better than any coat I have ever had and because it is such great quality that I expected it to last at least a few years.Unfortunately the zipper broke and now the teeth just separate when I am wearing it from the center so now I have this really great winter coat that is less than a year old that is basically useless because I can no longer zip it up.I always felt that the zipper was the weak link on this coat compared to the quality of the rest of it. The zipper seemed a bit cheap. And I did get a lot of use our of it as I was wearing the coat every day last season and putting it on at least 3 times a day to walk the dogs. So that definitely is a lot of zipping. Still, I did expect to get more than one season out of the coat.That said I loved it so much and the sale price is reasonable that I will be purchasing another one of the brand in a different style and hopefully have better luck with the zipper next time.For now it's loosing a star because of the zipper not lasting otherwise it would have been 5 stars all the way.",
