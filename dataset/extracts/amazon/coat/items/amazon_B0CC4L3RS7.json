It\u2019s a lightweight 100% rayon and has a nice, silky feel and soft drape. It won\u2019t be as cool as cotton in very hot weather but should be ok on all but the worst summer days. It falls to mid-calf on me (I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d), and I\u2019m happy with that. I normally wear a size 16 but ordered a 2X because I like things loose. I definitely could have gotten a size smaller but I like the flowy feel of the 2X. I don\u2019t care for the white daisy applied trim on the bodice - I think it looks dated and granny-like - so I\u2019m removing it. Easily done by unpicking the stitching on the wrong side with a seam ripper and a little patience. I\u2019ll save the trim for the next time I make a little-girl dress. Rayon can shrink, so wash in cold water & air-dry.",

Now, after wearing this dress several times, I notice that it always wraps to the right when I sit in it. Looking in the mirror I see that the button placket has a visible warp to the right. (See photo.) This warp is what makes it so uncomfortable to wear. I'm constantly trying to set it straight. I'd ask for a refund or replacement but my return window is closed. Stuck with it, I guess.",
