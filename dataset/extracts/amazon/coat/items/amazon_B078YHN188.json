                "reviewText": "We were excited about this jacket for our 4yo. We placed an order which kept getting delayed so I ended up reordering and had it shipped to another address which it delivered within one day. So not sure what happened there? Not the reason for my bummed experience. We got this for my 4yo for a ski trip. The jacket fit him perfectly and I felt he could move around easily and wasn\u2019t too stiff. He wore it for only two days one was at ski school, the other was just a couple hours playing in the snow. When we got home I wash all of our ski clothing and place in a space saving back for the \u201cnext time\u201d. I followed the washing directions which are pretty straightforward and when I pulled it out of the wash there is a hole near the button as seen on the photo. Now I would expect something like this after hard play or long wear or multiple washes. But this happened after two wears and one wash. Super bummed about it! I would hope this is kind of a one off situation but not sure if I would take my chances again with this one. The color was awesome and like I said before the fit was great but the quality is questionable unfortunately.",
