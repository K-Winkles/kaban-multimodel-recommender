She's from a warmer country and this help her get through the winter. The olive green color is stylish and fits well with different types of palettes. It is quite durable and not that heavy for the size and functionality of it. The foil material inside helps insulate the body heat well and no cold air comes through. Great for winter hikes and walking in the city with wind blow at you. Definitely considering to get another one for her and I. Recommend this to any one.",

I was apprehensive to give this one a try, but the price was hard to beat. I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised! I live in west Michigan and warmth is my biggest need in a jacket. This one definitely helps retain heat/block the cold winds, is comfortable, functional, and cute! It fits true to size. I\u2019m especially pleased with the length. I am tall and sometimes struggle with clothing lengths, not the case with this jacket! Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "After trying on, and looking for many many Parkas, this one fit my curvy, pear shape. It is super warm, zips up and down comfortably. I like the extra snaps for a super warm closure with the zipper or just a quick snap closure. The color is more of a muted black, but I still like it ..it just surprised me. The hood has a Velcro strap in the back which makes it more manageable if you just want a little bit covering you or if you really want to lose your head in it. It\u2019s not too heavy compared to many that I tried on and the longer length is also a bonus as it doesn\u2019t cut right as the widest part of the thigh. The sleeves are very long but I was able to fold them back inside and they stay fine. That would be the only drawback unless you like that look. Overall, I\u2019m super happy with this coat for an amazing price.",

The lining is reflective which I really thinks help preserve body heat when the coat is zipped up. The colors look nice with the navy and white/grey trim. I like the fleece lined hood, I hate wearing hats and this worked well with ear miffs. I like that the faux fur is removable and that the hood is adjustable.The con is the sizing, it is very straight and it tighter around the hip are for me. The sleeves are also a little long. It also makes noise, which some people do not like.",
