It's incredibly flattering whether unbuttoned or buttoned, which was especially important for my anniversary date dinner at a restaurant with a dress code.Made from a blend of 15% wool and 85% polyester, this coat strikes the perfect balance between style and functionality. The notch lapel and long sleeves give it a classic, dressy appeal. The front button-up closure, double-breasted placket, and decorative buttoned belt at the back elevate its visual appeal, and the knee length provides great coverage and style.Functionally, it's designed to keep you warm and cozy in cold weather with its windproof and thermal qualities. The addition of two hand pockets at the side adds practicality. You can pair it with various outfits, from turtleneck sweaters to jeans, dresses, hoodies, and both heels and sneakers. This coat is versatile and suitable for daily life, work, school, outdoor activities, travel, meetings, and dinner outings.I was pleasantly surprised when I realized how versatile it was, making it a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. For reference, I'm 5'4\" and weigh 155 pounds, and the medium size fits me perfectly. It's the perfect choice for special occasions and everyday wear!",

The quality of the coat is similar to some higher end brands and the Camel color is perfect for fall outfits! So far it\u2019s been comfortable in 40 degree temps but I haven\u2019t worn it in any colder weather yet but I anticipate it being fine so long as I\u2019m not outside for hours.",

The sleeves are a little long for me because I\u2019m short. I folded them inwards and it problem solved. Other than that, it fits well. It\u2019s roomy enough to wear a thick sweater underneath but it doesn\u2019t feel or look too loose on me. I guess a small could have worked for me too, but I always prefer to have some room to wear layers. However, it is warm enough by itself.The quality is good, and because of this, I am considering ordering a brown-herringbone next.",
