                "reviewText": "This is my preferred brand of white coat. I wear it daily and wash / bleach it weekly. The fabric is excellent, I like it because it's thick and it drapes well, so it doesn't ever look cheap or warped. I do have to iron out wrinkles after each wash. The sleeves hold a nice crease long after ironing. I find that after about 8 - 10 months of daily use, stains around the collar / cuffs become permanent and the shoulder seams rip open, which is very good compared to other brands. I like to sew the lapel lining down on the inside, otherwise it comes loose throughout the day and looks a little sloppy. So far, I have not lost or broken any buttons to wear.For sizing, I am 5'3 and 110lb and I wear the size 0, but I have to roll the cuffs up once. Excellent coat!",

My only issue is that the seams are starting to fray and I've only washed the product a handful of times. For long-term usage/more hours of wearing, I'd purchased something that is more durable and holds up to the usage.",
