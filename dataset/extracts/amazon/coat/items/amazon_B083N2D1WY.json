I wore a tank with a fleece shirt over it under the coat and am a big cold baby, so it did really well. The length is fabulous! My legs were warm! I have a warmer Canada goose jacket, but my legs and butt are always cold - with this coat, they were finally warm and I think that helped keep my feet warmer. I can\u2019t wait to try it out in the spring rains.",

                "reviewText": "I'll start with sizing. Normally I take a large so thats what I tried first. Was fine if my arms were down, but if I put my arms out straight forward like I was reaching for something, the cuffs of the sleeves would be at the middle of my forearms. The extra large version was what I needed.So more generally speaking, this is a very utilitarian jacket. Lots of pockets, very waterproof, suprisingly warm, and even kinda heavy for what it is (which is good!). It is a little awkward to get the zipper started, but I think any long coat is like this, and the added warmth is worth it.I would recommend this to anyone. FYI, I live in central lower peninsula of Michigan and its good enough with just a t-shirt under it most days. Just go with a size larger than you normally do.",

My only concern is that it is a little tight for a XL and shortly after receiving it the coat hanger came apart on the coat though the liner still has one. overall a good coat and received it just before we went into two weeks of Artic outflow combined with Snow and heavy freezing.",
