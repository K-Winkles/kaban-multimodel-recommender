It\u2019s easy for me to find pants in small sizes that are tall but struggle finding upper body clothes with long enough torso and arms. I needed a coat that was warm and longer than my ski jacket and tried many high end retailers thinking I\u2019d find good quality, warm, long arm &torso fit but alas, nothing fit. I happened upon this jacket and it has exceeded all my expectations in quality, fit, warmth and style. I travel a lot for my job and on long flights it feels like I am wrapped in a comfy blanket. It also compresses easily enough to squeeze into my suitcase on a whim.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a Black Maxi Size Small. It was huge! I am normally a medium, but the sizing chart is different than most. I was able to fit a DOUBLE Puffer, Down Jacket WITH Vest underneath the coat with room to spare!SO I purchased a Stone Gray XS to see if it fit would work. It still has PLENTY of room for layers but looks and fits much better. My only issue is that the Black Size Small has noticeably more fill in it. It's puffed out and when you run your hands down it, the fills is very apparent. The XS in Stone is significantly flatter, doesn't puff, and when hands are run down it, it feels most flat. This might cause a problem with warming when I take it to cold countries. Otherwise, the coat is beautiful, though the Black S feels significantly warmer than the Stone XS. I have no choice but to go with the latter due to the size. Update: even the XS is very large. That same double puffer jacket fits underneath even the XS. Still great coat!",
