Designed as a unisex style, you get the choice of buttoning on the left, or buttoning on the right--whatever fits you! 10 Pearl Buttons 10 pearl buttons embellish this coat with a classy and professional look. The buttons fasten the double-breasted front together, giving you an extra layer of protection against contact with hot objects. With buttons engraved with the Chef Code name, this isn't any other chef coat. It's made to stand above the rest. Stain Resistant and Micro-Sueded Our 7 oz. twill has been micro-sueded for extra softness and treated with a stain resistant finish. Made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester, this blend has been woven in such a way as to give itself an understated gloss and natural drape that is absent in other woven fabrics. Dress like an elite chef without trying too hard. Reinforced Durability Who doesn't love pockets? Even better are pockets with reinforced stitching details. That's why our pockets have been thoughtfully crafted to strengthen areas of the coat most susceptible to wear and tear.",

                "reviewText": "I love the design of this chef coat, the accent yellow and black piping made it feel fancier than my standard white coats and the yellow is actually more of a gold which was a cool surprise to me. The shoulders are more squared off so it gives a nice clean look with an apron over it, and who doesnt want some nice broad looking shoulders at work. It is a thinner breathable fabric but still crisp and non-transparent. I wore it a lot and received many compliments from my co workers on the fit and the accents so i am glad i got it for sure.Now for my issues. Sadly it has started to get a little fraying on the piping after multiple washes and the stitching under one of the arm pits has come undone in one spot leaving a minor frayed hole. I like to think i take good care of my chef coats but it is a uniform for a demanding work environment with a lot of heat, sweat and movement so i do feel it was too soon to see the kind of wear i was seeing. That being said i still like it and I still want to wear it so i will probably tend to this coat more than i normally would which speaks well to the design and fit.",
