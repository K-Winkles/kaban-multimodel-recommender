I am very happy with my extreme weather puffer parka coat. the fur trim zips off,and the bottom sides of the long coat unzip for easy movement, the sleeves protect very well even for bare hands. It is a very warm coat. heavy duty fabric, and stitching. The zippers look strong and good, they work. The top breast pockets are exactly that, pockets right over each breast, and when you reach into the pocket its a little funny. the coat is true to size, and fits. I am happy that my coat arrived sooner than was predicted.",

                "reviewText": "I was impressed and I would say I\u2019m kinda hard to please\u2026. This jacket fits perfect in all the right places. True to size. Roomy but not too roomy. Flexible but not too stretchy or stiff. Material is surprisingly soft and jacket is very warm! I like that you can remove the fur good rim. Only negative for me personally is the pockets don\u2019t have slits on the sides like normal jacket pockets, they open from the top only but there are lots of other places to put things.",

                "reviewText": "***2-25-23 UPDATE**This jacket is definitely warm, no doubt! But after the first couple weeks of having it, a huge seam unraveled between the pockets on my rise side and the left side on of the buttons fell off so it\u2019s just a flap. It looks trashed and I don\u2019t even wear it everyday. I had higher hopes for the quality of this jacket. I do not know how to repair the button that is lost since it was a metal one, and I do not know how to repair a 7 inch rip between pockets. I don\u2019t think I will buy again from this brand-15 with a -20 wind chill and this jacket keeps me warm. Warmer than my Columbia space jacket! Just get it. Tons of pockets, I don\u2019t have to carry a bag or purse with me when I shop in the winter. Beware, if temp is in the positive double digits the jacket is extremely warm you WILL sweat. It\u2019s a great jacket, I just love it.",
