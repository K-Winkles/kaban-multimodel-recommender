                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a great winter coat with certain features for a long time and this one did not disappoint! For reference I'm 5'3\", 149 lbs with a 42\" bustline and I normally wear a large. I purchased the large and it fits perfectly, with room to layer underneath it. I did not need to size up. The features I was after were a removable hood, tall collar, wind proof zipper flap, two way zipper, long length (yet not a midi or maxi length), welt pockets without a zipper, and ribbed trim around the cuffs. The flaps on the front pockets tuck nicely (flat) inside the flannel lined pocket and there's no scrapping your hands across a metal zipper every time you put your hands in the pockets. The fur isn't high quality, but a bit of fluffing and it will probably be okay. If not, you can easily remove the fur. As far as quality, the fabric is nice, the weight is hefty and craftsmanship is excellent. At your normal size, this jacket is form fitting, not boxy. If I had sized up, it would have been boxy on me. The durable synthetic fill will allow you to easily wash this jacket in the washing machine. Like most puffer coats it's a bit bulky however, it's a very comfortable jacket to wear and it is super warm! Last but not least, I got this jacket during a deal day sale and paid less than $70.00 for it making it a great value at this price point. I looks like it was much more expensive than it really was. If you're on the fence about this purchase, order your normal size and try it on! You won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "This coat was much heavier and warmer than I had expected for the price. It\u2019s nicely well-made, the first came very wrinkled. I needed a little bit of steaming and fluffing with a hairbrush to get it to look like for instead of really artificial, but it looks really nice. Haven\u2019t tried it out yet in cold weather, but this is a much longer coat than I was also expecting I expected it to hit just a low the wall Hip line but it\u2019s mid to high. The size runs a little small. We ordered an extra large, but could\u2019ve actually gone a little bigger than that for a 5\u20196 180 pound person. But there is a bottom zipper that you can lift to give you a wider range of motion. I felt like I did not have a lot of flattering aspects and was more straight sided. Then I would have light but since it\u2019s here I will keep it. I wish it had a belt or something to add an accent around the waist, but as it is, it will be a nice heavy duty coat. I don\u2019t think I will want to wear this every day because I do feel the movement is a little restricted, but I was expecting a very lightweight coat and I\u2019m glad that this is heavier built. It has some weight to it so if you\u2019re sensitive about the weight of your outerwear, you may consider that . It would be really difficult to pack this coat being as the fill is really fluffy it says polyester, but it feels more like down. I don\u2019t know how it will wash up but I don\u2019t in planned to find out it says surface wash, and for the most part, that is what we will do.",

I liked the look of this pretty blue and took a chance on ordering it. I am so pleased with it. It's warm but not overly \"fluffly\", a very pretty color, and is long enough to cover my posterior without making me look like I'm wearing a sleeping bag. The hood is overlarge, but I don't think most women wear the hood anyway. It's the whole hair thing. After receiving this coat, I actually ordered another in the coffee color and love it, too!",

It\u2019s actually real nice and I love it. It\u2019s thick, warm and looks good; the only thing is it\u2019s not at all form fitting. It\u2019s rather boxy but that\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019m a 160lbs and 5\u20193\u201d and got a large based on the reviews and it\u2019s perfect. I actually couldn\u2019t be happier with it. It came a bit wrinkled and you need to fluff the fur a little but it fills out right away. Super cute, warm and great for the price. I live in NewEngland and today it about 32 degrees and it\u2019s nice and warm. \ud83e\udd76I highly recommend this jacket.EDIT: I\u2019ve not warn this coat in 10 degree days and it\u2019s AMAZING!! I think it\u2019s actually one of the warmest jackets I\u2019ve ever purchased and I\u2019m a big skier (not wearing it skiing) but definitely apres.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this jacket is awesome! I bought it because I urgently needed a winter coat after the zipper on my prior jacket broke. I find it to be very warm. I have worn it in temperatures as low as 15\u00b0 and felt warm and insulated. There are two things that could be better, though. First, the hood is oversized. For that reason, it hangs down over my eyes so it's not very functional; I usually end up wearing a hat instead. Also, the zipper is a bit fiddly as you have to insert it exactly right for it to zip up.I ordered a size large and it is a little loose on me and the sleeves are a little too long. However, I think a medium would have been too tight around my hips. For reference, my measurements are as follows: 43\" hip, 33\" waist, 38\" bust.",
