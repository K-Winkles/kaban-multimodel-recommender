                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Coat. Great Price.",
                "reviewText": "Extremely happy with my purchase. The coat looks great and looks of decent quality for the price. It's nice to be able to stay outside the $200-$400 higher side coat price range and get something that looks good and fashionable. I rotate clothes a lot, so having several winter coat options at more reasonable prices fits the bill perfectly, just as this coat does. And, at the price, if can get 1 or 1.5 seasons wear, I'm happy.As for coat fit, I'm 6'3\", 34x34 pant, 15 1/2\" neck, 36\" sleeve, 40\" chest, 175 lbs, more triangular build. The large fits a bit loose at top, but that's my issue as I prefer a bit tighter fitting clothing. So, not a manufacturer problem in my opinion as some online clothes can be. More so, I wouldn't downsize due to the sleeve length which was absolutely perfect. And, above all, the extra size accommodation at top, of course, is likely given to accommodate a suit/sport coat underneath. And, while peoples suit/sport coats length can vary, if my suit/sport coat is buttoned, this coat covers such an undercoat just fine. If the suit/sport coat is unbuttoned, that coat hangs a bit out from underneath from this coat. Not an issue. Just FYI. And, with my preference for likely wearing with just a sweater, this size will be great and as tailored to one as one can expect from ordering online.I ordered the coffee 01 color, and no disappointment there. What I saw in the pictures, is what I got. I was worried the blend might look a bit cheesy. But, no. Very refined looking and just the color I wanted.Some people said they didn't like the buttons, that they are maybe a bit flashy, i.e., not just solid color or standard brown/black. If you are way conservative in dressing, or need that, perhaps so. I get it. But, I think they are a nice accent. I worried a bit about that too. But, when I got the coat. Not a problem at all. Looks great and if a real concern I think the coat is worth it to have a tailor put on the buttons you want.Last, there seems to be a bit of confusion on the reviews as to whether its too short or that its more of a waist coat. Yes, this version is. For me, it fits more to my upper thigh, or right at mid-point on pants pockets. HOWEVER!!!, within the color options, different lengths are presented, so beware! And that is perhaps what people are noting. One color you like, might be a different coat style/length than another color you like. So, carefully read the description and look at the sleeve bottom to coat bottom ratio in the pictures for length approximation or read the size charts, which I think pretty accurately depict the difference.I picked up on this difference and decided to also order a longer length coat in another color by this manufacturer, in case the first didn't seem to fit as I wanted. I am keeping both! as these are really decent wardrobe additions and each of the lengths I thought I was picking is exactly what I got. One other point on some of the comments, this coat did come with a scarf. The other coat under this manufacturer that I got with the listing shown to come with a scarf, did not. So people have noted this. Perhaps true. But, in seeing that possibility ahead of time before ordering, I knew scarf or no scarf was not going to be a deal breaker at this price. Also, I believe some folk contacted the manufacturer and got the scarf separately. Again, not a deal breaker for my purpose.Anyhow, long review....but I was really impressed with the coat(s) from this brand/manufacturer. In buying 2 at still a fraction of a $400 single coat price, I can rotate and likely get better dress options and similar wear, and I will look for this seller's clothing in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this jacket looks much more expensive than it is. I wanted a nice \"dress\" jacket for the winter months, and liked the look. For the cost, it was worth a try. The jacket looks well sewn, and the liner is comfortable. It's warm enough for casual winter wear, probably into the 20's, but it''s not a parka or ski jacket.I'm 6' tall, ~215 lbs, and went with the X-Large. It fit extremely well, although I would have preferred an extra inch in the sleeves (which is the case with almost everything I buy that isn't a \"tall\" version). The jacket isn't too bulky, it fits well enough when sitting in a vehicle for a commute.Overall, this is now my daily \"office wear\" jacket during the winter months.",

At best this could pass for a cheap fall jacket... At BEST. It may as well be a blazer/sport coat, but def not heavy enough to take you through even a moderate winter.Also, the fabric is SO cheap!! Honestly it'd almost be funny if this were at 1/2 the price. And that \"detachable scarf\" is also really cheap and didn't have any attachment system as claimed.Thank goodness for Amazon Prime returns.",

                "reviewText": "First and foremost, the jacket looks great. I've been wearing it for a few weeks now and have received multiple compliments (mostly from random guys) on how it looks. The built in inner scarf (which is annoying to actually connect to your jacket with the super tiny stretchy loops) gives a great boost of color. It's also more than warm enough for winter, especially if you layer it with a long sleeve shirt or sweater.Onto the less than great parts. While the length is perfect, the chest region is a bit tight. I'm about 5'9\" and 160-165lbs and the medium is restrictive in my shoulders and arms, so much so that I usually prefer to take my jacket off when driving as you need unrestricted full use of your limbs to drive. The other down side is that the right pocket had a giant hole in the bottom that fed into the insulation portion of the bottom of the jacket. The actual insulation is light and feels like pulled apart cotton balls (not a bad thing, just weird). I had to sew it up and now it feels weird because I'm horrible at sewing. I probably could have exchanged it...but I ordered it late into winter here and needed a new coat so I dealt with it.Otherwise, for this price this jacket was well worth it. I'm not sure I'd buy it again because the fit is a bit off. The arms are perfect length, it's just the chest that sits a bit tight. If you are more on the narrow side of chest size though, this could be perfect for you. If not for the massive hole in the pocket, I would have given this 4 stars because it really is a great value at this price point.",
