                "reviewText": "I bought this jacket for a recent trip to London. It worked out perfectly! It was lightweight enough to pack and worked in all weather conditions while I was there. The temperature was in the 40's and 50's F while there, and this jacket kept me warm and dry the whole trip - even when I got stuck out in the rain. I appreciate that it has a detachable hood too. It dries quickly and folds up pretty small. I like the length and look of the jacket as well. I think it's flattering on all body types. I live in New England and now that I'm home, it is my winter jacket. It works perfectly with layers or a sweater to keep me warm and dry in cold winter temps. I highly recommend.",

It is thicker than the puffer I recently took on a trip where the temps were 30-40 F, so I'm sure it will be quite warm with a couple layers underneath. The only problem is that the extra snaps to tighten the waist if needed/wanted, are not already sewn in. They came in a little plastic packet and now I must take the whole thing to a seamstress or tailor, since I don't sew. Too bad this wasn't specified in the item description. Also, it runs quite small. According to the measurement chart, the XL would have been my size, but thankfully I also ordered it in XXL after reading reviews. Now I'm returning the XL. Overall it was a good purchase.",

                "reviewText": "While definitely too thin for real winter wear, this is nice for those spring or fall days when there is a nip in the air. It is certainly more attractive than other puffer coats and the waist can even be adjusted. Also has a decent and removable hood. The pockets are so deep they can contain a cellphone or wallet and still have plenty of room to keep hands warm. That\u2019s a plus in my book. However, there is no wind flap over the zipper so it lets cold air in. I would deduct 1/2 star for that if I could. The zipper seems to be good, though there still ought be snaps or buttons for backup just \u2018in case.\u2019 So pretty and reasonably priced compared to local stores, I even ordered a shorter jacket in another colour from this line.",

But otherwise it\u2019s really great jacket what I wanted. It\u2019s really hard to find in stores like this. Loved it so comfy and light. So because of size I have to return it. I will keep eye on until my size arrives. Because of wrong measurements on chart I take off one star.",
