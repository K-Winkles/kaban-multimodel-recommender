I was surprised again, I got more than expected out of this jacket. I fit it perfect, I have big boobs G, and I can button this up and not feel squeezed into it, I got a 4x cause I wasn't sure, a 3x would have been tight, the sleeve is a little long on me but no problem, Love it, Buy it. I hate wasting money on clothes you see online but again I got a great surprise in this jacket.",

                "reviewText": "I love this coat! I normally wear a large, but ordered an xl for shrinkage. It did shrink a little, but I may have still been ok with a large. It washed beautifully, I use wool balls in the dryer and it was wrinkle free! I bought it to wear when I go teach fitness classes for coverage, work out clothes are not warm in the wind and cold. This is warm enough for 40-60 degree weather and I use it a lot. I feel like I can stop by the store in it after working out and still look decent. I can also wear it for casual or even semi dressy occasions like a date with heels and it's nice looking. I was pleasantly surprised and may order another when I have lost weight because now I can't be without this coat! I wear it a lot more often than I expected, especially since I don't need to iron it! Great weight material!",

None have fallen off yet but I\u2019m expecting it to happen soon. Outside of that, the size recommended was perfect (I sized up for a looser look) and it looks exactly how it\u2019s pictured.

The smell is very strong, but this is not unusual for dark denim so it should diminish once it is washed and airs out. But the buttons on the right side - like a man\u2019s jacket - will drive me crazy so I don\u2019t know yet if I will keep it. None of the photos in the ad nor in the posted reviews show the buttons on the wrong side so it was a surprise to find it this way. Also, it is not roomy enough to wear a sweater beneath it so I might decide to give it another try with a size larger.I am 5\u20194\u201d, 230 lb, and busty. I bought the XXL.",
