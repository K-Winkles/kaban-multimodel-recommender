The hood is detachable as well and I\u2019m not sure if that was in the description originally. The size is accurate so an xxl is an xxl. The outside material feels and looks well made, smooth and clean. The only issue I had was there was a hole in the right pocket at the top of the stitching. I\u2019m going to sew that up myself. Also this is minor but if I walk around with the coat unzipped, because it\u2019s very warm so I unzip it going into a store, but the sleeve cuff Velcro always gets stuck on the front Velcro and it constantly snags. It\u2019s a little annoying but not a huge deal. All in all I love this purchase and would definitely get another one!",
