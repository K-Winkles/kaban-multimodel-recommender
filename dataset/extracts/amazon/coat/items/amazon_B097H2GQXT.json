                "reviewText": "I ordered the Rose Red in size Medium. (5'3\", approx 145lbs).The coat itself fits well and as expected. I was able to layer a thick wool sweater underneath both coat layers and zip comfortably, though a bit bulky looking. The color is a bold hot pink color with a shade of purple/pink. Personally, I like the color.* The outer layer has 3 outside pockets that zip. One on the left breast and one on either side for your hands. All 3 of these pockets will hold Samsung Galaxy 9S Plus phone with a standard otter box & pop socket; a 3DS XL with a standard case or a longer wallet from Hot Topic. The hand pockets will hold two of the items at the same time, but due to the heaviness of the items, I wouldn't recommend it. It also has an inner pocket which does not zip and is made of the same material as the outside jacket. The inner pocket is large enough to hold one of the above items, however all will stick out a bit on top.* The fleece layer has 2 outside zipper pockets which will hold both the 3DS XL and the S9+ phone at the same time (though it's heavy, so again, I wouldn't recommend it). On the inside of the fleece layer, there are 2 pockets (one on either side) that will also hold both the 3DS XL and the S9+ phone at the same time. These pockets also completely cover the two items and seem much more intact/sturdy than the inside pocket on the outside liner/jacket.* There are two snap buttons for wind/zipper protection. One at the top and one at the bottom.Now for the quirks....* The hood covers your head but doesn't go beyond - so this leaves your face to get wet if it rains. If you wear glasses, as I do, this could pose a problem.* The draw string for the hood is at mouth level and not really long enough to pull tight. Again, since the hood doesn't cover much more than your head, this would again leave your face completely exposed if you were able to pull the strings tighter.* The velcro pieces for attaching the hood tightly under your chin arrived with both \"soft velcro pieces\" on the outside of both sides. Rather than a rough velcro piece on the outside and a soft velcro piece for attaching them together on the inside. Needless to say, because of this, attaching the hood together under your chin will not happen.* The fleece layer must be turned inside out in order to zip it to the outside layer. A ridiculous design if you want to wear just the fleece layer as now you'll have to remove both, turn the fleece layer right side out and then put on again.Over all, the jacket is nice. I do not plan to return it, even with its quirks. Although I live in New England, I bought this coat for an upcoming trip where it's prone to being cold, windy and rainy at the same time. I just received this jacket yesterday, so I may report back after wearing it some in the New England weather. We're only in October, so there's a whole season of Fall & Winter weather coming up.",

                "reviewText": "Morning on a farm consists of feeding 6 heathen horses, I don't even know how many angry feathered dino-chickens and some screaming goats.... all of which create more mess ( and poo. So. Much poo, like everything is just constantly pooing) then a cackle of children could ever imagine making.Then winter comes along with rain and WOW.If you don't have a decent waterproof coat, things go from gross to regretting lots of life choices. A few empty bottles of wine and maybe a existential crisis or 5 ( chicken poo - cicles mixed with half chewed horse feed and omg is a goat chewing on my coat?!)Now normally I'm a champion at avoiding all of the above, cus I'm a deep south gal and I've never had a winter coat. Never needed one. Till I did and dodged buying one because I hate frozen chicken poop, but my lovely partner needs help on the ever growing farm.No more excuses for me. Nope.The waterproofing means the poo and half chewed feed, it wipes right off.The jacket is well made, with excellent stiching and durable fabric a fact that was well tested by goats and a barn cat that thinks it's a parrot and insults on setting on my shoulder.Comfort- it's incredibly warm and soft, like a nice little cocoon, making things far less miserable.All pockets have zippers !! Never thought I'd be as excited with zippers as I am, but zipper pockets are right up there with deep Jean pockets. I can put treats in them and zip close to avoid and Pony noses from nipping treats out.It's light weight and I'm actually able to move in it, which is important for safety purposesAll jokes aside, it's a great coat. Warm, durable, easy to clean and dry. This is probably one of the best things I've bought for myself.I'll probably be buying a second to keep in my truck.I definitely recommend it to any other lady that has any type of outside work to do. You won't regret buying it.",

                "reviewText": "I usually wear the medium or small size. It depends. According to the previous reviews, I ordered the Medium. When it came in, I found that M fits me well, and there is some space for a thin sweater underneath the inner fleece jacket. Good quality. I think it will be durable for a while. And you can wear the out layer and inner jacket separately or together. The waterproof shell is a rain coat. The inner is soft and comfortable. The color is matching that in the pictures. All zippers work smoothly. Two more things need to be emphasized. One is that the front of the hood need to go into a hidden compartment within the collar to attach, otherwise the same Velcro (seems both are LOOP) of the hood can not connect by themselves. Another is that if you want to wear the fleece liner only, you need to make inside out after detaching from the out layer unless you want to wear your jacket with seams outside.",

My issue with this coat is the color... \"Red//Rose\" is what they call it, and that seems to be the colors in the initial photo... However, the coat is PINK with PURPLE on the sleeves.
