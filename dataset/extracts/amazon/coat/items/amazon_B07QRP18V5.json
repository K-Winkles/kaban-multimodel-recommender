I really like the elastic on the ends of the sleeves to keep them in place on your arm. I feel the coats do run a bit small according to the size charts. Buttoning it up it fits well in the chest area but getting to the hips and thighs it a little tight so while walking will be fine if I try to sit I have to unbutton the bottom button to make sure it doesn\u2019t rip. All on all a great product for rainy days and protection at theme parks.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5'8 and on the thinner side. This thin rain coat did a pretty good job shielding me from getting wet at the college football game. Outdoor football stadiums are great when the weather is nice but tricky when it rains.Pros - GREAT length to keep my backside dry, elastic on the wrists, super light weight, hoodedCons - I got a little wet at the game since it was closed with snaps instead of a zipper. If the snaps could be moved so that there would be more space for an overlap I think that would help..",

It certainly could not fit a backpack underneath. On wrist elastic snapped, and due to it being too tight, I was able to just snap the other. Do not recommend.",
