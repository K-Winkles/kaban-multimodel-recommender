Made for women, this great fall and winter jacket features a long silhouette with a modern fit and drop tail. Crafted of a water resistant shell, lined with Omni-HEAT reflective lining, along with a yummy plush fleece lined collar, quality assembly, construction, and stitching, the advanced technology infused into this jacket will instill a sense of confidence when the weather turns super blustery and cold. Unique to this jacket, the sleeves have built-in thumb holes and comfort cuffs to provide a sense of control and warmth to your arms and hands. The two-way main front zipper provides up/down options for flexibility of movement and warmth control when needed, while the zippered side pockets keep your small items secure (including your hands when the outdoors get extra cold). The water resistant fabric keeps you protected during unexpected downpours. This women's winter jacket is offered in multiple colors and sizes. Extended sizing available. Active and Regular Fit. To ensure the size you choose is right, utilize our sizing chart and the following measurement instructions: For the sleeves, start at the center back of your neck and measure across the shoulder and down to the sleeve. If you come up with a partial number, round up to the next even number. For the chest, measure at the fullest part of the chest, under the armpits and over the shoulder blades, keeping the tape measure firm and level.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace an old LL Bean jacket I had for over 15 years. Here are my key highlights: - Warmth is comparable, yet it is half the bulk. - Love the built in thumb cuffs. Keeps drafts out and not visible if you choose not to use them. - Not sure how the omni-shield interior works, but keeps me nice and toasty without overheating. - Fleece inside the hood is soft and washes well. - Pockets are zippered, and has an easy to access interior zip pocket at chest level which fits my phone. - Length covers more than a standard jacket and keeps your bum warm when sitting outdoors.Important note: this is water repellant, but not water proof. It does a good job of beading light rain but will not help in a storm or extended periods of rain because it will eventually soak through.Have worn this in temps down to 30's on the west coast. Absolutely would purchase again!",

                "reviewText": "I bought the dark cherry color. It looks very purple in person to me, and I thought about returning it, but I'm so glad I tried it on first. It's fantastic, and while the color wasn't what I expected, I'm warming up to it.I'm 106-108 lbs., 5'2\". I purchased the XS. It has tons of room in it to layer (and at first I worried it'd be too big), but\u2014visually\u2014the fit is very flattering and surprisingly fitted for how much I can layer under it. This will mean I could probably use it in weather that is colder. As it is, I suspect it would be fine down to 20F without much (or any) layering.This is a versatile coat that can be worn to an upscale event, but it can still look awesome worn over casual wear just going out to a movie night with friends. As someone with Raynaulds and arthritis (and hates lugging around gloves), I'm always a fan of Columbia's coat cuffs with thumbholes. These did not disappoint. They feel comfortable. They are a little longer than others I've had in the past, but since they are stretchy that's no big deal for me. They fit well around my wrist or hands\u2014depending on how I want to wear them and they don't look too long because of this once I put the coat on. A lady who is tall and has trouble finding jackets with long enough sleeves would probably the longer length of the hand warmer cuffs to be an advantage, but it works very well for us petite ladies, too.The zipper is a bit problematic. You have to take time to make sure it's very well seated before zipping it up. I expected this from other reviews and have had jackets like that in the past. Over time, I'm hoping careful zipping will \"train\" it to move better. I may try rubbing a candle along the teeth to see if it will work better.I'm very glad to have found this on sale. I look forward to wearing it this winter and know it will look just as beautiful for future winters hopefully when we can safely go back to events.",

                "reviewText": "i\u2019ve been searching for the perfect \u201cwinter jacket\" for a long time. The casual jacket you can wear during a cold fall or winter when you just don\u2019t want to wear a full length formal wool coat. One thing I have found is that the puffier jackets aren\u2019t always the warmest and they certainly aren\u2019t always the most attractive, particularly on curvier women. this jacket truly matches its height and that it is light weight, doesn\u2019t make you look like you\u2019re wearing a snowsuit, and actually keeps you super warm. I give a big shout out to the design which has a high zipper for the neck and an attached hood which gives great coverage whether wind, rain, snow or just plain cold. Also noteworthy are the extended sleeves which completely insulates the wrists and hands while wearing gloves. The jacket feels and looks high quality. It was true to size and it\u2019s slightly flared which provides an attractive silhouette.",

The jacket was still within the 1 month returns period, so when I came back, I got in touch with the amazon customer care. They told me that without the original tags the product could not be replaced or exchanged. I had obviously not kept the original tags because I had not expected such an issue to come up. I got in touch by email directly with Columbia customer care, and with some push from me, they have replaced the product, without the original tags, saying that their products go though heavy testing for harsh conditions, and that the product I received must have been a defective product and they were sorry that i received it. I\u2019m glad they took responsibility for it, because after paying so much money for a jacket, it was indeed a disappointment that it tore so quickly. Thank you Columbia, for your great service.",
