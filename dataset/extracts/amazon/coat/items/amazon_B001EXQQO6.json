                "reviewText": "This is a nice chefs coat, but it runs large. When I read that in other reviews, I thought I take a chance and order my size. I should have listened to the reviews. I normally wear a 4X and when I got it , it swallowed me. It felt like a 5X / 6X . I returned it for 3X which fit perfectly. Returning the chef coat was a complete headache, but I won't deduct a star from that. Save yourself the headache and order one size smaller than what you wear.",

I could have gotten a medium, but I like bigger, more loose tops. Compared to other coats, even chef works brand, this is the best in comfort, durable, I bleach it, not so hot, perfect.",

Chef Works is thee go to brand for me. They have a low price point but they are extremely sturdy. The first 10 or so washes they seam a little stiff, however after that they are very comfortable.",
