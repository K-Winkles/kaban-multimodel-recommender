                "reviewText": "I swear I wear this sweater almost daily. I love a long sweater that has a slim silhouette. I was a bit scared about the wash and dry but I have done both.....delicate for the wash and low for the dry and it comes out so soft each time. I like that you can use it to dress up an outfit and you aren't boiling hot in it. My only complaint is that when you hang it up, the front doesn't lay flat unless you fuss with it a little bit. It sort of bends in towards the front. I am not a iron girl. The last time I ironed something I cried out of pure frustration. If you are having that problem also, you can clip the front to force it to stay flat or of course you could air dry it flat. I will most definitely be purchasing more colors in the future.",
