        "description": "The Women\u2019s Carhartt Medical Rugged Flex Modern Fit Bonded Fleece Jacket is an ideally affordable men's jacket from a brand you can trust for all of the best technology, ultra-durable products, and a fit and comfort like no other. This men's medical coat has earned the Rugged Flex stamp of approval with the perfect amount of stretch, and is treated with the popular and reliable drying technology for durable water repellency that encourages the fluid to bead up and roll off before it gets the chance to soak in. This makes it perfect for any healthcare shift. The two large front patch side-entry pockets, with the front patch pocket on the wearers left proudly features the classic Carhartt logo, plus there is an exterior welt zip pocket on the wearer's left chest for storing smaller items securely. The jacket is a full front zip with a Carhartt logo zipper pull with a chin guard at the top of the zipper for comfort. It also features ribbed sleeve cuffs so you could pull your sleeves up if needed and they would stay put. You can also tuck the ribbed cuffs inside surgical gloves for an added barrier and to help keep anything from getting on the clothing or your skin. The bungee ID loop is placed smartly along the shoulder seam so that you can use it if needed, but it goes virtually unnoticed if not in use. At Carhartt, we make hardworking workwear for hardworking people. We stand behind the quality, craftsmanship and performance of every workwear product we make, because we are worn by the hardest-working people of all \u2014 healthcare professionals, veterinarians, construction workers, auto mechanics and other everyday heroes.",
