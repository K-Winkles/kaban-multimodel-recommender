The coat is such great quality and so warm. I have tried Alo,Milly brands and Ugg is by far the best. It has that silky feel where the material doesn't attract everything and all the teddy coats run big, that's the style , so if you don't like that big oversized look you'll have to size down a size. You can't go wrong with ugg and it's most affordable from all the other coats. Edit; after ordering the black coat I'm a little disappointed that the coat was clearly worn!! It has an unpleasant smell and long red hair over, also long white dog hair!!! I can't stand it thinking that someone used it, packed it and sent it back..it happens all the time but, the Amazon team should of inspect it better. So, the coat is not black but charcoal color, still beautiful and heavy like the first one. Same size S ( I'm always M but they run extremely big). Not sure if I'm keeping it due to the bad smell on collar or try to clean it BUT HOW!! GET THE COAT..the returns and refunds are very simple!",
