Per other comments, it runs a bit large, so if you are a small 2X, order the 1X, etc. Impressed with it all the way around. I wanted a lighter weight coat that was 'dressy' and casual - perfect. I also like the length, about fingertip length. Sleeves are not too long (I get this alot - and I am 5'8\" - they just make womens size coats strangely - but NOT this one). I am tempted to order another color.",

The 3X was way too big and the 2X was a little smaller, but still somewhat large. Very well made and heavy for extreme cold weather. Too hot for where I live in the winter. Good buy for the money, I would definitely recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "I wish I could say that this purchase is getting a good deal on a high quality item, but it\u2019s not. The fabric is somewhat better than felt and I can tell it\u2019s not going to look nice for long. I\u2019ll wear it a year, maybe two if I can remember to be very careful with it, and in the meantime do some more serious looking for a lasting quality coat, and of course be willing to spend a lot more.For the price I suppose I can\u2019t complain. I remember the days of being able to get something much better for not a lot more than this cost, and I\u2019m only in my thirties, but of course that\u2019s not the world we live in any longer, and right now I didn\u2019t want the hassle of having to travel for hours to higher-end department stores. If you need a classic looking pea coat on short notice, this will do, but don\u2019t expect to wear it for years.I\u2019d say it runs a size or so large. Amazon recommended the 2X which seemed too large to me anyway, and then I read the reviews saying it runs big so I went with the 1X. It\u2019s a hair too big but the next size down would certainly be too tight.",

I was pleasantly surprised to see this coat available on Amazon. I also ordered grey. and blueThe packaging was apalling (red coat)!!! The coat was in a box with the second coat which I ordered in grey. The grey coat was on a hanger folded in a bag. The coat was wrinkled. The red coat was literraly balled up and dumped in a plastic bag taped arround in the most bizzare manner for a garment. No hanger. And so wrinked I finally gave up and sent it to a cleaners for steaming. Absolutely incredible that someone did not notice or care about the condition and the presentation of this item to the customer! I gave five stars purely for the quality and fit of the coat.The blue coat was appropriately packaged on a hanger in a box appropriate size for this garment.",
