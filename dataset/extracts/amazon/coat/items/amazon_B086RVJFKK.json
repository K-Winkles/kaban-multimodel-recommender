Not really an issue but the lab coat isn't very form-fitting. It is slightly too big. It would help to think of the sizing as men's.Brought it back home at the end of the quarter and washed it. I noticed that there was a hole in the sleeve. I'm not too sure if this happened after I washed it or during lab. However, I didn't notice it before.",
