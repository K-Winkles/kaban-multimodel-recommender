But the caveat is the waist line- it\u2019s bulky frumpy doesn\u2019t give you any shape as you can see in my pictures. if you don\u2019t care what you look like that\u2019s fine it\u2019ll work for you, but I wanted this to look nice when I wear a dressy outfit or go somewhere nice. But I am returning it because it was eighty eight dollars and looks like a thirty to four forty dollar coat because of the waist.",

                "reviewText": "Everyone loved this coat, so I wanted to, too, but I'm not sure I'm sold. Here are my thoughts:For reference, I'm: Size 14, 5'5\", 185 Pounds, 38D.Purchased a size Large in 09_BeigePros:-If you think a loose fit in the chest and waist is a pro, then you'll be happy. It's not form fitting.-It's fairly light compared to a peat coat. It's not wool, which makes it nice for fall/spring.-The length is good - to my knees.-I always worry about my shoulders because I have thick arms and hate when tops or jackets are too tight in my upper arm area. This had plenty of room.-It has the ability to button on either side/in either direction. One side has button holes for both buttons, and the other side has a hole for just one button (see image).-It's very soft and has a little give.-It has full deep pocketsCons:-I didn't feel that the color really matched the photo. It was hard to capture in the room I was in but the image made me think it was more of a greige color, but it's definitely a light caramel beige color.-It feels a little too big and baggy overall. I may try to size down, but again, I worry about the arms, so we'll see. I don't like things to fit too snugly, but this felt a bit too much.",

The color just didn't suit me as well, as it has a lot of yellow undertone in the camel colour rather than brown or beige. It was very light weight and just didn't feel like a great quality to me. For the price I guess it's what you'd expect. Maybe it would work if you had it taylored or added a belt?",
