I got caught in a heavy rain walking home , I thought I was going to get drenched but when I got home under neath I was dry didnt get wet, my jacket was wet but not me. So that was FIRST test. Then a couple of days later it started snowing while I was walking Home, and I just brushed off the snow no damage done and it kept me warm.. I love the pockets it has with zippers and buttons. the hat keeps your head dry and warm with a beannie underneath im happy.. The look is great , get alot of compliments on it. This jacket is great. Its not to heavy but it does the job all the way around. Love it",

                "reviewText": "This seems to be a very nice quality coat, especially for the price. I just received it, so only time will tell how well it holds up over time. The outer material feels very durable - much more durable than I was expecting. All of the pockets seem to be very well made. I can tell that the coat will be plenty warm. The inner material is cozy. It\u2019s a perfect length in my opinion. I am a 5\u20198\u201d and 145lbs male, I purchased a size small, and the bottom of the coat ends at the middle of my thighs. The length of the sleeves are perfect. I appreciate the inner elastic cuffs at the wrists to help keep snow from going up the sleeves. I\u2019m personally not a fan of fur hoods, but much to my surprise, not only can you choose to remove the hood altogether, but you can also choose to remove just the fur trim on the hood. I was excited to discover that because the product description and photos don\u2019t make it clear that just the fur trim is removable. All in all, I\u2019m very pleased with the coat. I have no complaints.",

Tossed it into the dryer for a few minutes with a wet cloth to get out the wrinkles and it came out perfect. Even the faux fur looked better, I'll probably take it off unless I plan on being out in the wind. I'm 6' and 195lbs, and I ordered a large and it fits perfect. Although not too much room if you have more than one other layer on, I usually wear a kangaroo coat too and it was just right. I would highly recommend this coat for any Canadian winter.",
