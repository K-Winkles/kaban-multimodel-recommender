                "reviewText": "While the coat fit me, it was snug under the arms and when I sat in my car it rode up to just below my bottom and my legs were cold. Had to unsnap to feel comfortable.Also the material is not smooth more of a mat cotton, don\u2019t know how clean it\u2019ll stay or if lint and hair will stick to it.I was only wearing a very light sweater and the fit was snug. I bought the medium and am 5\u20196 and about 135 lbs.Keeping only because it is too hard to get back in the tiny garment bag and I needed something for trip. If I had tried in person probably would not have purchased.I do like the warmth, the hood and the big exterior pockets.",
