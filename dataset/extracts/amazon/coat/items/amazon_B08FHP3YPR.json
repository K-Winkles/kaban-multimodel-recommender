                "reviewText": "It looks great. I really like the modern style. Sort of casual, but also classy.It's very comfortable and warm. It's way more comfortable than a typical trench coat.The XL size is a bit long in the arms for me. I originally tried L, which was almost perfect, but tight around the waist. It's designed for a slim person, so I had to go a size larger.The outer pockets are nice for keeping your hands warm. There is a pretty large inner pocket at the upper left. Perfect for a very large cell phone.I like that the material is not stiff, can stretch a bit, but holds it's shape well. I could wear it right out of the bag it shipped in without needing to flatten out fold creases. Nice.I wear it almost every day since I got it several weeks ago. It's been machine washed and it still looks like new.It's holding up well. No issues. I am very happy with my purchase. And I am thinking of getting another one of a different color.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. He is a small. Always a small. Ordered it in a small and it fit perfectly. In fact, he could even wear a light sweater under it and still button it up. The tan color is a beautiful shade of tan, and Will match with anything. Whether you\u2019re dressed up in business attire or wearing something more casual like jeans and a sweater, the coat will not look out of place. The fabric is really soft and it feels like fantastic quality. The craftsmanship is very nice and everything looks very sturdy. I think my son will get a lot of use out of this and will last him for a long time. he actually wore it that night that he received it and the next day.",

Resulting in a baggy look, even after I layered up with a sweater underneath.Quality wise, its surprisingly not bad, the outer layer is not itchy and not rough and the inner layer (while made of noticeably cheap polyester) is soft and comfortable. Pockets are a bit shallow and thin feeling, but that never bothered me. Also very warm.Shame it was too big on me and arrived damaged, already initiated a return.",
