Nice touches with a mesh lining, pockets and velcro cuffs & a drawstring waist and a large hood that folds into the collar. Just what I was looking for in a rain jacket, something light weight & seems Perhaps they'll add a small inside pocket for a phone/glasses.Hmm, kinda wonder if I should have gotten an extra large. Large fits fine but wouldn't mind it being a little bigger.",

When walking around in hurricane weather, everything ended up soaked except what was under the jacket, which was bone dry. There are also various decent-sized pockets to store stuff in. Only con was the sleeves are a little long on me.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered one of the cheaper jackets on Amazon, and that didn\u2019t turn out well, and returned, then found this and though I\u2019m not a fan of Columbia(don\u2019t get me started), at least I know the brand well, and found the orange-red chili color for twenty five but Amazon showed it would take a month to deliver(watch out when ordering), so I looked again and then saw the blue one for twenty nine and ordered. Came with a retail price tag of seventy five. Whatever all that means. Was looking for a cheap rain jacket that works, that was all. I\u2019m a short guy at 5\u20194\u201d and 165lbs, 41-42\u201d chest, and usually wear a 31-32 waist. I ordered a medium and it feels exactly half a size larger, likely tailored just a tad larger to give room for layers underneath. Being short, I expected the sleeves to be long on me, but they weren\u2019t egregiously so, and the Velcro holds at wrists so sleeve length doesn\u2019t seem like a big problem. This isn\u2019t exactly like a fitted jacket but half and half between a windbreaker style and old fashioned raincoat. It\u2019s a bit baggy and roomy. The cut is rather \u201cuniversal\u201d and I wish was a bit more slim and flattering but this way will fit most body types. Not a big deal tho. It does have a packable pocket inside for packing the jacket into but I haven\u2019t tried it since I want to keep the DWR intact as long as possible before my hiking trip and don\u2019t want to wrinkle up severely beforehand. The packable pocket is vented netting which I imagine would be friendly for wet jackets though I still wouldn\u2019t pack a wet jacket for more than a day cause mold. I haven\u2019t tried the waterproofing either but I bought this for hiking and later monsoon seasons in Southeast Asia, and so I got a backup poncho anyways, and the jacket label says waterproof(look picture), so yeah, it ain\u2019t one of those windbreakers that some salesman is trying to sell as a rain jacket. I\u2019m sure it will be fine for my use. The craftsmanship and manufacturing seems very well done, and all in all, can say for sure for thirty bucks was a bargain. Happy with it, though I kinda did like that red chili color better. This is one of those rain jackets that scream, \u201chey don\u2019t judge my baggy fit cause I\u2019m a raincoat,\u201d and the orange color fits that a bit better imo. Too bad orange wasn\u2019t in stock when I ordered, but the blue looks good too. The jacket does look and feel quality for a lowly rain jacket. Thumbs up.",
