Simply a zipper for aesthetic purposes and to be honest, I would have preferred it not be there at all. Additionally, the other pockets seem smaller than I think they should be. Otherwise, color is great, nice and thick, should be warm. I\u2019m waiting on my son to get home to try it on and may be returning it. Not sure yet.",
