                "reviewText": "So glad I got this coat. Ordered 3 a few days before heading to NYC last week, from Florida. This as medium looked nice and reasonably fitted,. even with multiple layers under it. Not a blimpy look. Two other brands that were medium may have fit alone, but heading to 20s-30s from FL I needed to be able to add multiple layers. This even allowed adding my 32 degree vest underneath on a particularly cold walk. Worn over shirt and sweater on return at 40s in FL it worked well too and didn't feel overly big. The medium was perfect size for what I needed. I am 5'2\" and 125 lbs. When I took it out of box I was leary because so thin and light. But other reviews said ok with layers at 20-30 and they were right. If used to cold may need fewer layers. I was even shedding them at times. Was never uncomfortable. Could roll it up in it's carry bag and stick in a back pack or large purse in museums/theaters. On me it came about 3 \" above knees so helped keep legs warm. No problem sitting at that length. I got the Copen blue which is a nice light navy. The removable hood is also a nice feature, along with the zip pockets. No list gloves. The only down side ( no pun intended) is the feathers. They were coming out inside and getting on my wool pants and sweater, and coming out a lot on outside as well. On a site with a similar coat, similar problem, they suggested pinching fearher on inside and pulling back into coat rather than pulling them out. Easier said than done. As long as enough stay in to wear a few winters I will be happy. Overall great coat, especially for the price. Thicker fabric to contain the feathers better would make it a 5. But then may cost more.",

                "reviewText": "I love this coat! It is thin, not bulky but still provides great warmth on cold days. I'm 5'7\", 200ish pounds and got an XL for a looser fit. A large probably would have worked but I like the looser feel for when I wear bulky sweaters underneath. A very pretty green color too! Length hits a little above mid thigh.",

Depending on the color of the item you were wearing, you may not notice it, but when you are wearing black, you will definitely see small white feathers all over you.I loved that it kept me quite warm in New York, and it was light enough to carry around when it got a bit warmer.If you\u2019re in a pinch and want to buy something affordable, I would recommend.",
