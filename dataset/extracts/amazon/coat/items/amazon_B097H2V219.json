This is a true winter jacket but not too thick/heavy, the lining is soft and warm.Tested the waterproofing by turning on a water hose about 1/2 flow and forced it directly against the fabric for 30 seconds = the inside remained dry. The seams don\u2019t appear to be taped and the zipper @ the hood probably means that over time in rain or snow some moisture might get through, but for $43 I wouldn\u2019t expect expedition clothing performance. I\u2019m confident it will keep me warm and dry in normal use. Light gray is a bit darker than the ad photos.",

The box was small for the jacket. When I opened the box and it was vacuum sealed. I opened the bag an it immediately like quadrupled in size. I tested it out and fits great. I wear XL but I ordered it XXL because of the inner layers I will wear with it. The jacket is comfortable and definitely keeps you warm. I was sweating in 40 degree weather. For the price, it is good quality for years to come.",

I wore it with a T-shirt thick hoodie and was ok. I wish it had an inside pocket. The chest pocket may be waterproof but don't expect your phone to fit. It's probably big enough for a pack of smokes, if that's your thing. The side pockets are deep enough for gloves or your phone and they zip which is nice.",

I got it at a great price, it's warm, looks good, and is light weight. I recommend it for your consideration.",

The quality is very good and should last a long time. The fit is perfect. A good addition to your mans winter wardrobe",
