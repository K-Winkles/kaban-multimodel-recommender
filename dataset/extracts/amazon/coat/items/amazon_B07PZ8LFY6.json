                "reviewText": "I purchased this coat we're talking about almost 10 months ago, and it has been through an entire winter season. I can't express how impressed I am with its performance.First and foremost, durability has been a major highlight. My kid is a bundle of energy, and this coat has endured their constant adventures, roughhousing outdoor play, and all the challenges a winter can throw at it. Despite all the wear and tear, it still looks as good as new.The warmth this coat provides is truly exceptional. Even on the coldest days of winter, my kid stayed snug and toasty. The cozy lining and well-designed insulation kept them comfortable, even during extended outdoor activities.One of the things that made this coat stand out is its practical design. The zipper is easy for my child to use independently, and the hood comes in handy on those unexpectedly windy days. Plus, the pockets are a great feature for storing small essentials.As a parent, I greatly appreciate the easy care of this coat. It has been through multiple washes, and the fabric and color have held up remarkably well. No fading or loss of quality. I'm confident it will continue to serve me well this upcoming season as a hand me down.This coat has exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it.",

The seams are stitched well, the materials a warm, soft and plush, high pile (puffer)I appreciate Amazon filling a great need for coats that will be quickly grown out of, and the cycle into many hand me downs. This coat will last and it is warm most importantly! And it has a snappable snow cuff. Zipper is great quality too.",

It\u2019s very warm but probably not what I\u2019d pick if you\u2019re from up north where it gets actually cold. Fuzzy on the inside, waterproofish on the outside and has a nice attached hood. My son likes it and it seems true to size.",

The zipper is quality, with an internal waist band of soft, smooth elastic to keep cold air from blowing up the coat. Very helpful for his small waist. Holds the coat close. Love the soft interior, the hood shape is logical and the zipper doesn\u2019t poke and scratch his neck but can zip up under his chin to keep cold air out. No fraying or unraveling of seams as of yet.",

                "reviewText": "Had a cold snap and realized that our child had outgrown all his winter coats. We needed something fast. We normally buy jackets in-person but couldn\u2019t find what we needed in stores. This jacket had great reviews so I decided to purchase online, instead. This jacket has exceeded our expectations! It\u2019s soft with a plush interior lining. Roomy enough for layering. We also love the snap button closure around the waist, keeps our child warm. Our child loves his new jacket and wears it almost daily. It\u2019s held up to various cold weather activities and is easy to clean. If you are on the fence about buying this jacket, do it! Great investment!",
