It looks great on-With the only fit issue is the sleeves being too long (I\u2019m 5\u2019 1\u201d so shorter arms). I believe this will be a benefit for most people and it is pretty easy to hem them to the right length. I do recommend this if you\u2019re looking for a black lab coat.",

I wear XL in almost everything and I ordered a L this time after reading various reviews (and the fact that the XL was $12 more than the L at the time). That being said it is a bit snug on my arms and from my waist down. I generally only do up the first two buttons anyways (for movement) so the fact that it is snugger on my belly and hips doesn't affect me. I like the professional look of this coat and the bit of extra stretch it offers. It washes up well and does not need ironing!",
