                "reviewText": "I love how lightweight this jacket is and how warm it is. It feels paper thin, which is what I love but it is probably one of the warmest coats I\u2019ve ever owned. The hem and sleeve length is perfect. I am 5\u20197\u201d and 135 pounds. I hate when coats are too snug when you have bulkier clothing like a sweatshirt underneath. The large fits me really well without looking too big or too tight and I like my clothing and coats to look tailored. I would recommend this coat to anyone who wants something really lightweight and warm. I normally wear a small or a medium sized coat so this does run small. I recommend ordering up one to two sizes from what you would normally purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Reviewing to emphasize this coat *absolutely* runs small, as it did for me. Definitely heed the warnings to size up, whether or not you want to wear this with layers.I made a calculated risk ordering a small based on three factors: my measurements (32B, 28\" waist, and a broad-shouldered but compact 138 lbs), reviews saying this ran small, and my recent experience with many brands' size S being overwhelmingly boxy around my torso. The size S fit like a seriously unsexy second skin, so I'll have to try again with a medium.Am trying again because the pluses are what you see in all other reviews: lightweight, packable, great warmth to weight ratio, good quality zippers, and a more fitted silhouette - definitely not a boxy cut. And the malbec color if a nice rich reddish maroon, if that's your jam. A great value if you can get this on sale.",

I am going to order a med and a large to see if one of those fit me. I am doubting this coat will last 12 years like my other one did. Columbia you used to be so good.",
