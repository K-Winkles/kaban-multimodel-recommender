                "reviewText": "I bought this jacket in rouge pink (medium) for wearing with my workout clothes around the house since I get cold easily. It\u2019s perfect for this purpose and warmer than expected. The length is great for my 5\u20194\u201d height as it easily covers the bum and front which is good when I run to the store in leggings. It\u2019s true to size (I have 37B chest, 38\u201d hips) with ample room for clothing underneath. I would wear this in as low as 30-40 degree weather (probably not for a long period though). The fleece material and zipper are good quality and very soft inside and out. (I would prefer a 2-way zipper though which this does not have). I may purchase more colors. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Based on previous reviews stating this jacket ran small on some people, I ordered the XXL. I am returning it, as it's way.... too large on me, not flattering. I am ordering an XL for replacement, as I still want a little wiggle room in case I have a sweater underneath. The XL size will be more flattering, and nip in at the waist somewhat. As I am tall, I personally loved the length, a shorter person would not. I wear my clothing well so this jacket will be perfect for me. Received the size XL and it fits perfectly, love its longer and nipped in at the waist giving you a nice shape when zipped. I would highly suggest ordering this jacket as it feels great and looks very nice. I'm normally not a person who wears anything \"sweatshirt\", but I am very happy I ordered this. I am going to order another one as I like it so much!",

                "reviewText": "Okay, let me be Frank because I like that name. This item is made for a thinner woman. It looks lumpy otherwise. If you're svelte, you'll like how you look in it. Thankfully the person I bought it for likes how she looks in it. I don't. But as long as she likes it, I'm good.What's with sending this garment in a plastic bag with one of those pull zippers like you see on food storage bags? I'm surprised it reached me with all the crime nowadays. Anyone could have just reached in and taken it out of the bag without a problem.Now for the good parts, because we always like a happy ending after the bad stuff that happens in the movie. The color was true to its appearance online. The color was gorgeous and bright. The fabric is very soft even before washing. The quality of the construction is terrific. That's a pleasant surprise given how shoddy a lot of Made-in-China stuff is now. Thoughtfulness in design is evident. There's a flap at the top so the zipper doesn't rub your chin. There are tabs on the zippered pockets making them easy to grab. The pockets are generously deep, even to insert your hands past the wrist. Your cell phone or a hand warmer can find a place with your hand inside them. The sleeves aren't too tight. The extra length past the belt line adds warmth in cold weather. This garment services well as added insulation over thermal underwear and under a heavier winter coat in severe cold. The hood is generous. This garment can be used by joggers, walkers, at the gym on the stair climber or treadmill, and bicycling. It can keep you cozy while lounging by the firepit at night outdoors, or sitting in the shade of the park, and will serve those functions well in Spring and Fall weather.",

It\u2019s not too tight and it\u2019s loose enough to where I can move around. It\u2019s also a good length and not short at all. I also love that the pockets have zippers and there are two hidden pockets inside. Definitely not for freezing winter weather but it is warm for maybe like a 50 degree weather. Overall, I love it.",
