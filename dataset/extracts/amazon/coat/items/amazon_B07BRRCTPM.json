                "reviewText": "I got this coat to wear at the office with my dresses. I needed something that was classy, long, and warm. This is expensive for me but I think its worth it. Its a long. I am 5'2 and it go well past my knees. The fit is great. I ordered my size I normally order and it was spot on. There are two down falls though so I will go ahead and warn you. The buttons are too lose. When you get it and start taking it on and off, it will cause them to become loose. I had to reinforce them with some black thread. Not a huge deal to me personally. Also, if you have pets that shed a lot, forget it. Or order a bunch of lint brushes with the coat. Its BAD BAD BAD for that. Its the material and they have to use it because that's what keeps you warm. I struggle with the coat for the reason. I must have a lint brush at ALL times while wear it because I will get in the car and ill get it on me and I didn't even know we had it in there. We only have two small dogs. A yorkie and a small puddle so I cannot imagine big dogs.",

It's flattering with the belt to give me an hourglass figure. I got the red, and it's a beautiful color. I am 5' 8\" and 170 pounds. I got an XL and it fit's nicely. Because it's lined, my shirt sleeves slide right into the coat without bunching up. It's a great coat. If you don't mind the heaviness of the coat, then I highly recommend it.",

I am 5'4\", 132 lbs., chest 37\" and hips 38.5\". The medium should have fit me perfectly, but it was snug in the chest with no room for even a blouse underneath. The shoulders fit perfectly, and the hips were form-fitting but not too tight. It is a beautiful coat, but unfortunately not quite a perfect fit.",

Only negative thing I can say is there are two different size charts on the product profile. I didn't realize this until the first one I ordered came back too small and I was stumped. Further down in the listing is a \"new and improved\" size chart. Thankfully, the return process was simple and I love the jacket.",
