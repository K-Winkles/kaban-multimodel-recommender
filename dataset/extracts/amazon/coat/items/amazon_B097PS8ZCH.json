I have been on the hunt for a lightweight trench coat that is modern, on trend, versatile, and lightweight at a great price point. This meets all of my expectations! It does run a bit large. I originally ordered my normal size M (8/10) but had to reorder and size down to a small for a more tailored fit. Don't get me wrong, it still has give and allows for wearing a heaver material garment underneath (sweaters, professional blazer, etc.) while not looking boxy. The beautiful draping is what really set this apart from other trench coats! I'm 5' 6\" and the length hits me beautifully at the calf. It's buttery soft and fully lined. I also really love the look of the tortoise brown buttons on the bodice and sleeves. This is just that good and the quality is what you would find at Banana Republic and J. Crew for a fraction of the price!",

This coat was the perfect length for me and looks casually elegant. It's lightweight so I don't recommend it in the winter but for fall it's a great outerwear option. It looks good both buttoned and unbuttoned but honestly I think it looks a but better unbuttoned because you can get \"lost\" in the trench coat kind of easily. Overall it's a good staple piece of clothing in the fall season.",

I am 5'3\" and got a size Small, and it fit great on top. However, it was too long for my short frame and the belt hit at my hips not at my waist, so I had to return it. Like I said, it fit great on top though so I didn't want to get an X-Small because I think that would be too small then. I wish they offered a short length!

I would say size down if you want a slimmer fit and go with your true size if you want an oversized fit. It\u2019s a great jacket!",
