Upon first look, the product looks cute, but the fur falls out super easily. I personally wear a large comfortably but I ordered an XL and it didn't even fit.

                "reviewText": "The coat itself was very nice, very warm, and could've possibly been comfortable too, had it been made properly. I bought a size small which is what I always wear, but the sleeves at the armpits was sewed way too short in length, meaning they should have added more stiching, further up the armpit area of the arm, instead of starting to go down the inside part of the arm too soon. I also didn't like the zipper because after zipping it up all the way the zipper started to go sideways instead of straight up the the frontal part of the body and thoracic area. Also after zipping it up, I didn't have much room at all for movement and it felt very confining around the chest area even for me, and I have smaller breasts, so that should say something \ud83d\ude05. I don't believe this coat would fit at all on a woman with larger breasts, so be mindful of that when purchasing.",
