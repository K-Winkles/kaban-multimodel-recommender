                "reviewText": "ANOTHER UPDATE: I LOVE these fleece jackets. I have bought a number of them and just bought three more. These are fleece lined and then sherpa faced on the outside --hence a double thickness of warmth. The snaps work well. The small fit me perfectly, at 5'3 and 120lbs. The colors are pretty much as shown. The snaps are substantial, the webbed hem and cuffs are really perfect and somewhat stretchy (I even fit the sleeve over my cast), and the neck buttons up nice and high for really fiercely cold day. I do have a little trouble getting some of my coats and jackets over these as they are of substantial thickness.THESE JACKETS/FLEECES ARE A LIFESAVER AS THEY HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SUBSTANTIALLY TO LOWER MY HEAT, EVEN ON REALLY COLD DAYS, TO ABOUT 62F. ONLY MY FEET GET COLD. BUT WE HAVE AN OIL FURNACE SO HAVE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS WITH OIL PRICES SO HIGH. IT IS NOT IN MY NATURE TO GIVE RAVE REVIEWS, BUT IN MY OPINION THIS PRODUCT DESERVES 5 STARS+++++.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: I first bought two for myself to see about the fit and quality. The small fit me perfectly, with the little bit of looseness I like for a turtleneck or tee underneath. I'm 5'3 & 117 lbs. The length is good and the small size hits at my low hip, & the arms are just the right length. (My arms are longer than you'd predict from my size.) Thus, you can expect these to be true to size, & they certainly look MUCH better than they appear on the model. Why did they use those awful photos?The fleece is very thick, does not shed, and is a bit stretchy. I cannot believe how warm, -- oh so warm -- they are. The pockets are substantial; I can carry my big cell phone around in them. Be sure to keep them tucked as intended (from near the side seam & then toward the zipper) or they can make you look a bit thick around the girth -- not a big issue, though, as you simply need to adjust them when first putting the fleece on.The quality is very good. The snaps are substantial and go all the way up & down, allowing ANOTHER fleece to be worn in various styles, such as open, partly open, mostly closed, or turtle neck style. The ribbed front placket, pocket openings, & the cuffs are very nice: thick, well-sewn, & somewhat stretchy. The colors on my phone screen compared to the colors that arrived are very similar.I did not expect these to be as thick & lush as they are, so I do have some trouble fitting them under a few winter coats & jackets. This, however, would not stop me from buying more!I did not expect these to be such a good buy, BUT THEY ARE, so I bought quite a few others in different colors. The quality control & sizing remained the same. No worries about some being too big & others too small.I highly recommend these, especially if you live in cold climes or just like to lounge around in cooler weather in something really comfortable. A big thumbs up on these.UPDATE: I washed a few of these. They wash nicely on a permanent press cycle, and they dried without leaving lots of fluff in the dryer or on other clothing. Now I highly, highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this lightweight jacket on my Wishlist for awhile and it finally came up on a Lightening Sale so I grabbed one. My cream colored jacket is as beautiful as advertised! Once I shook it out and fluffed it up in my dryer on low heat it was ready to wear. The Sherpa style is as seen, the interior is smooth without rough seams and it\u2019s nice and warm. A lighter weight jacket for sure but I was warm and cozy in 50 degree weather. I really like that the sleeves are proportional, it seems that a lot of what I buy lately have really long, bulky sleeves. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and 127 pounds and this jacket fits perfectly! I\u2019m delighted with this purchase and I\u2019m thinking of buying another one, there are lots of nice colors.",

This is a great quality, warm, soft alternative to a winter jacket (think fall/ spring) but it\u2019s not one I would wear to a football game or active outing. The arms are just a bit short and it\u2019s not going to protect your waist if you need to bend over. I would\u2019ve gotten a large to be a little more wearable over sweaters and such. Still happy with the purchase and wear it frequently for quick trips/ warmth.",
