                "reviewText": "I have the black trench coat. It's a really a nice, casual trench! Seems well-made and should last. No loose or forgotten threads to trim. 100% poly so it resists water well, but does get soaked through in prolonged rain (I live in the rainy NW).Fits well. I'm busty so finding coats that will close at the bust usually means they are too big at shoulders, arms and hips. This one fits! I can close it and I'm not swimming in it everywhere else!While I would deduct 1 star for the pockets and the belt, I'm really happy with this coat so far so I won't. But...Pockets: While they are welt pockets and very roomy, they don't button closed as they appear. I know welt pockets may or may not fasten closed, but the photos convinced me they would. Full disclosure about that would have be nice in the description.Belt: Really needs a sliding buckle as is normal for trench coats. Instead, it is a fixed one on the end. This means you have a verrrrry long length of belt hanging down, or you'd have to feed it through the loops all the way around the back and to the front again. Can't imagine. I'm sure that's why the model is wearing it tied in a bow. ;o)I'm trying to find a different buckle, but looks like I will have to go for a whole new belt...or see if my dry cleaner can do anything.",

This one did fit in the chest area but it was too big everywhere else. It also came to me without a belt. (It was packaged differently, so I suspect this was another person's return.)

Sch\u00f6ner, klassischer Trench, der gr\u00f6\u00dfengerecht passt. H\u00fcbsch zu Leggings oder Rock, in jeder Farbe ein Evergreen. Gerade kleinere Frauen, die in langen Trenchcoats leicht verloren aussehen, machen bei der Wahl dieses Modells nicht viel falsch. Das Material ist fest und h\u00e4lt einem kleinen Nieselregen stand. Eine Regenjacke ersetzt der Mantel freilich nicht, zumal er keine Kapuze besitzt. Auch der Verzicht auf Schulterpolster gef\u00e4llt mir, da diese oft etwas l\u00e4cherlich wirken. W\u00e4re sch\u00f6n, wenn der Mantel einige Jahre h\u00e4lt. Er ist zeitlos und solide.",
