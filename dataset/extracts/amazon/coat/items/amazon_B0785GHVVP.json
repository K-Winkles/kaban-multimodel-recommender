It is a bit big in the waist but not bad enough to return. I felt the shoulders and arms were not restricted as some reviewers said; I felt it was perfectly suited to my frame. I feel very fashionable in this coat. I ordered a small, I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d, 120lbs, 34-28-34. I feel small was the right choice of size. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I'm returning the coat because as soon as I took it out of the plastic package it was clear one of the arm seams was unravelling and the sleeve was destined to fall off with any wear at all! Pretty shoddy construction.Assuming that the coat wasn't falling apart in that one area, I still would have returned it as it honestly felt like wearing a glorified bathrobe and I could never image wearing it outdoors. The style of coat just isn't really for me!I'm 44\" bust and 49\" hips, at 5'4\": the XXXL size was a perfect size (the size chart said that equates to a US 16 & I'd agree). The shoulders weren't tight at all and it was comfortable to have a T-shirt and light sweatshirt on under the coat at that size.The wool-blend is soft but not very thick and felt a bit cheap overall. Not sure how warm it would realistically be out in the New England cold and should have been priced at or below $50.The best part was the color! The green-plaid is exactly as pictured and a lovely pattern; I wish I could find a nice double-breasted pea coat in the exact plaid! If you want a light fall jacket and enjoy this particular style of coat, and don't care if it's a tad over-priced, then go for it!",

I read the reviews before I ordered and I did the try before you buy in my original size (2x) and the reviews said something about the arms being to small and I decided to try it out for myself. Well, they were right the arms are very small. But I absolutely LOVED this so much I doubled back and hoped maybe if I got a size up that it would make a difference. Lol I got a 3x and I lie to you not the arm size on this 3x feels smaller than the arm size on the 2x. Like what's up with the arm sizes?!? Personally I'm a thicker girl but one thing I'm not doing is squeezing in a damn coat. It's to cold to try and be cute I'd rather be comfortable lbs. But I'd recommend this to anyone who feels they can fit it lol it's stylish super cute it's thick and I say worth the price honestly, it's wool. Fix these arm sizes and I'd get it in every color.",
