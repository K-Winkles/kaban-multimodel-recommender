                "reviewText": "I was contemplating getting this trench coat for a long time. I saw some reviews where the xsmall was still quite large, so I was a little concerned. I 'm 5', but I'm about 5'5 with my shoes on. So, after waiting a while, I used the try before you buy option. I received it within two days, and I figured if I don't like it, I'll just return it. Happy to say as soon as I opened it, I really liked the trench. As I tried the trench coat on, the xsmall fit me perfectly! I bought the regular Khaki, and it is a very comfortable fit, I love this coat. It's very high quality and does a pretty good job keeping me warm as well. It makes me feel like a detective too! Highly recommended!",

One thing I wasn't too fond of wither was that it has no top button closure. I had to use another safety pin to close the top in the rain TODAY. Besides that, everyone says it looks great. One fantastic feature about it is I am 5' 4\". This jacket reaches my shoes! I prefer that length, especially in the rain. I am thinking of having a \"top\" button put in by a seamstress to make it more rain-friendly.",

It arrives folded, but is not as wrinkled as you would think it would be. As for it running large, we did not find that to be the case. My husband is just under 6 feet and weighs 220 lbs - we ordered a XXL (his usual size in Ts etc), and it fits him perfectly. He is a funeral Director, so this will be going over a suit in all kinds of weather. It's the overcoat we've been looking for. Well worth the money.",
