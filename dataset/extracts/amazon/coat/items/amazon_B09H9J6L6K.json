I won't waste my money on trendy name brands, though. Eddie Bauer has a well won reputation for being a good name and the quality of this jacket bears that out. Workmanship is excellent and zippers etc. are smooth. The hood is well designed--it doesn't stand out styling wise but fits well when it's up. A good and fairly priced choice.",

I would definitely say it's a good color and washes well. It's light enough to be comfortable but keeps him warm in a California winter. Probably not the best for extreme cold weather but we do travel and has worked well in rain, wet fog, and Coastal wind.",

We will keep it bc we like it and it\u2019s a great quality coat, just not as thick as we expected. It runs a little on the small side. The hood is good and pockets are deep and warm.",
