                "reviewText": "Bought this for a pathogenic microbiology class. I like that it has snaps instead of buttons. I love the fitted, stretch, sweatshirt like cuffs (a huge plus when working with potentially dangerous pathogens!), and it was mid-weight and repelled quite a lot of the dyes I used. Easy to wash, wrinkle resistant (kept it stored wadded up in my backpack after washing and looked perfect each time), and it was rather long. I'm 5'4 and it went down below my knees. It is sized generously and I suggest one size down. The collar doesn't roll or turn up at the ends which is nice so it doesn't need ironing. I wish it had pocket slits and a back slit for a little more movement. Getting up and down from my stool was a little challenging at times but not bad. Oh and the front pockets are generously sized but no breast pocket. Didn't miss not having one. Great buy! It's a keeper! I'll probably just have it fitted and embroidered once I finish med school because I love it!",

I ordered a size small and it was still larger than desired, however, the extra length was nice. I\u2019m 5 2 and the length was roughly to my calves. The cuffs around the wrists are wonderful though; great functionality. The snaps also make it an easy on-and-off, which is nice when dealing with harmful bacteria and tools. Lastly, there is a pocket in the front, great for holding pens, badges, etc. Overall, I recommend the purchase, but you must size down.",
