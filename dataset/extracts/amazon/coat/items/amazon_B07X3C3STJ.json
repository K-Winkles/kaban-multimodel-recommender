I have wide shoulders and have good movement in this coat which I was worried I wouldn't have. The material feels like a carhart but not as stiff. Kind of like men\u2019s dickies work pants. I included close up of the material if it helps. Hopefully it\u2019s as durable as it feels. The hood is amazing at blocking face from the wind as well. The pockets are awkwardly placed I wish it was more to the side for easy hand placement. However I can place 2 regular sized water bottles (so you can get how roomy they are) in each pocket and it is fantastic. I like that the fur on the hood zippers on and off easily. It is also exactly as pictured and described.",

I like that it is a bit longer too so it covers my waist.My FAVORITE thing is how deep the hood. The lining doesn't feel cheap or icky.

                "reviewText": "I'm pleased with this purchase overall. It's warm enough and has a very soft and cozy lining on the inside of the coat. The zipper part under the neck is a little scratchy but it probably won't be a problem if wearing a scarf. Also, the fur around the hood for me is not my style and I am happy to say removal was easy and it still looks good without it. Disappointed by packaging/arrival because it was STUFFED into a plastic bag for shipping and is still extremely wrinkled as a result over a week later... not slight wrinkles... like ball up a piece of paper and the open it back up wrinkles. washign and drying and then if not just taking to the cleaners this weekend. Also, it takes on fuzz, lent and pet hair pretty easily. I never need a lent roller, yet I'm constantly pulling stuff off this coat. Last issue which is the biggest for me is pocket design. No biggy for most people probably. But, as someone who likes to walk with their hands in their pockets (holding my phone in my pocket and ready to grab pepper spray while commuting through the city at night). The pockets are deep enough to hold what's needed (phone, wallet, keys etc). However, they are placed directly in the front on either side of the zipper and the opening of the pockets are not very wide. So when it's cold and you put your hands in the only pockets, they are so small and awkward, that they force your sweater/shirt sleeves to raise and expose your bare wrist to the cold. That's my number one complaint because even with gloves, part of my wrist/arm is exposed because it also pushes up sweater sleeves underneath the coat. Overall it's good for the price (hence 4 starts instead of 3), but I would not purchase in another color as I planned to do. Gonna stick with it, so it's not too bad... just giving a heads up to others of the good and bad.UPDATE: It\u2019s now one month later. I stopped wearing this coat completely. About 2 weeks after the review, I got sick of the lent issue. After washing it and hoping the dryer cycle would help, it just got even worse and more dull looking. It\u2019s a horrible material for a coat (\u2026the black part on the outside. The brown fuzzy lining is still very soft and cozy.) I can\u2019t describe it, but it just reminds me of a cheap pillowcase. I changed it from 4 to 3 stars and it will be donated.",

I also never knew the jackets had pores. Ever since I started to wear this jacket the literal fluff inside of it continually seeps out of the \"pores\" of the jacket daily. Nothing can keep this from happening. I've used a lint roller and what does come off is replaced with double the amount by the next day. I spent a good deal money, thinking I was buying a really nice jacket since I moved to a very cold winter location. What crushed me aside from the absolute embarrassment and the way this jacket makes me feel incredibly self conscious when I wear it is that this would have been the perfect jacket for me. The color was beautiful, the warmth is amazing and so is the length. When I first unwrapped it the fur on the hood was wicked matted but I got over that quickly even though I love and wanted that look for the hood. This issue on the other hand makes me look unkempt and unfortunately is the only jacket I have to wear. It's too late for a return and I'm just so disappointed and spent a good deal of money on this product. I wish I could just get a refund so I can get a different one and not feel embarrassed everytime I have to go outside or anywhere.",

Ist nicht zu eng und gute Bewegungsfreiheit. Sie kann an der Taille mit Schn\u00fcren enger gemacht werden, so dass man auch eine Taille formen kann. Der k\u00fcnstliche Pelz ist bei mir gleich weg geflogen. Das Fell im Inneren ist super weich und angenehm. Die Tasche sind nur von oben offen aber das ist nur ein kleines Manko, was mich nicht gro\u00dfartig st\u00f6rt.",
