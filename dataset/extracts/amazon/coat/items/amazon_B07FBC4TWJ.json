                "reviewText": "I really do like this hoodie. It's my go-to hoodie for the cold Midwest winter. I first found this hoodie last winter so I've had time to wear, wash/dry and wear again many times. I can say with surety there is no shrinkage, no pilling, and the color has stayed the same. The fleece is still soft and keeps my warm. The elastic around the bottom and wrists have not stretched out. I regularly wear it around the house and don't have to hike my heat up as high to stay warm. And yes, I do get cold easily. I wear them under my lighter coats when I go out to run errands but don't want to wear the heavy bulky coat; and I stay very warm. I actually can't wear this hoodie under my heavier coat because I will be too warm.It will arrive shrink wrapped because it's so bulky, so expect it to be very wrinkled. I found that washing then drying it removed most of the wrinkles. There may be a few stubborn ones left over but after the second wash/dry all the wrinkles were totally gone. And I don't have to use the high heat setting in the dryer. Higher heat may dry in a little faster timeframe, but low heat works just fine.The only con I have is that the outer shell shows stains easily. Since I wear it around the house, I often cook while wearing them. I suspect it's oil splatters that get on it. Or it could be oil from lotion. I honestly am not sure what the spots are. BUT, I use Shout on the spots before washing and they come out spotless again. And there is no color variation from using the stain remover.Besides that minor con, this hoodie is perfect for me - so much so I ended up buying it in three more colors!",

No stray breezes made it through on the 2 subfreezing mornings I wore it. I love it so much that I bought another one, even though it wasn't on sale any more. The only thing is that I think it runs a little small. I'm 5'1\", 36B,150 lbs and I usually wear a medium top. I wanted it big & cozy so I ordered 2 sizes up. It's certainly cozy but not as big as expected, which worked out great because now I can wear it out and not look frumpy...lucky. I washed it on cold & tumble dried it on medium and it came out perfect. Buy it, size up, you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Nice warm hoodie for cold fall days. The lining is soft and cozy. I ordered a medium and it fits well, but I think if I ordered another I\u2019d get the large for the real oversized look. My only real complaint and why I give it four stars instead of five is it was shipped to me in a vacuum sealed bag. I\u2019m not sure why that was necessary, stuff never used to be except recently. There was way more than enough room in the box it came in to just be folded in a regular bag. If you\u2019re going to do that, at least downsize on the box! But as it was the hoodie came out with vacuum-sealed wrinkles, and it just looks bad. I am hoping once I wash it that will help, but some of them might be more or less permanent. It\u2019s really a shame when it\u2019s really nice otherwise. I\u2019m keeping it because it is comfortable and does its job, but I shouldn\u2019t get something brand new and have it looking like it was balled in the bottom of a laundry basket for years because of poor packaging choices.",

                "reviewText": "This looks well-made overall. Seams on this are finished. The cotton is good quality. Fleece is fluffy enough to show it's not that cheapy type. It's warm. My plan was to wash and run it through the dryer right away to shrink to size, since it's cotton. But can't do, per tag. Isn't flattering in any way at all. Smaller size wouldn't get rid of the 'boxy' look of it. But good for utilitarian wear (walking the dog). The zipper really doesn't look like, nor work like, it will last, which is a shame. I see that it's washable, but not for a 'tumble dry' through the dryer. Which I think means it'll have to be laid out to dry like a sweater. Not particularly convenient to do. Tag also says 'not dry cleanable'. It was shipped in a vacuum bag, so had major wrinkles. The wrinkles did mostly disappear after hanging up on coat hanger, aided by using a damp washcloth lightly on the worst of the wrinkles. Mine (blue version) did NOT have that usual imported clothes chemical smell to it. Summary: Hoodie has more pluses than minuses.",

Living in the south however a \"heavy coat\" can look very overkill and I also work indoors inside freezers so I need a good amount of move ability to get the job done. This coat lets me move freely and provides an excellent layer of warmth. My mom & aunt also bought the pants from this company and my aunt wears this set on her daily early am walk in the Mid-Atlantic area and she is raving on how it keeps her warm.I have washed it many times since I work in it and I havent had any issues whatsoever. It remains soft, zipper has held up, and I would not hesitate to recommend this jacket to anyone! :) One of my favorite Amazon purchases!",

She likes the warmth, the arms are just a tad long but she says that's fine in the cold, she says the zipper is good, she wishes the bottom waist-hip area was a little bigger but the actual hoody is just way too small and it pulls too tight at the back of the hoody when she pulls it up over her head. I heard that same complaint from other reviews, so I'm not sure why they don't fix it and just make especially the back part of the hoody larger. She was visiting to help me recover from shoulder surgery so she is leaving in three days so will keep the hoody instead of returning it for a medium because the small has perfect shoulders so the medium will be too big. She loves the warmth of it.ii",
