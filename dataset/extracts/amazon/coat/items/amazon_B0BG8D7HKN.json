As I remember they were a pain to zip and are constricting around the legs. I pulled the trigger any way as it looked so good and seemed like it would meet my needs. I needed a brown coat and the color of this one is beautiful; kind of like a caramel. It is lightweight yet quite warm. I like the cord that cinches the waist as it gives definition to my figure. I found out that long coats are still a pain to zip but one of the best features is that the coat can be unzipped from the bottom also thus it is not constricting when I drive. I am so glad I bought this coat.",

                "reviewText": "I got this at a super low price and beyond pleased for 30-ish dollars. It runs super large, so size down a couple sizes. I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and 150 lbs and the Small fits loose and has lots of room for bulky sweaters and layers. It\u2019s a little tent like, but the bungee like drawstring inside at the waist helps cinch it in. It\u2019s SUPER warm - I wore this to the ChristKindl market in the Midwest on a record cold day and was comfortable. However, I do wish it had a hood.Also love that it had a dual zipper - easy to unzip from the bottom when sitting or for easier movement.Overall a great value for the low price I snagged. Not overly flattering but super functional and warm.",

                "reviewText": "I am from Minnesota and a teacher with recess duty. It\u2019s perfect. The length is awesome. I am 5\u20198\u201d and 155 pounds with a 34 d chest. I ordered the medium and it\u2019s perfect. I love that it had the dual zipper and buttons. The cinch waist adds a bit of shape and the fabric is more durable than a regular puffer. My golden retriever won\u2019t puncture this coat. I love the style. I bought it in black. Very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "This zipper is really messed up. It makes absolutely no sense. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to do that top part as it really didn't fit into the track properly. Also, the sleeves feel tight. The rest of the coat is nicely sized and roomy, so it's just a strange cut. I LOVE the color and plan to wear it just snapped up (thank heavens they also put in snaps) because again, this zipper is just bizarre.",
