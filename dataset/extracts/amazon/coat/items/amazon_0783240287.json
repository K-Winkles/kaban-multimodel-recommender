        "description": "Product Description For the first time ever, Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fun-filled musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat has been specially filmed for video. Inspired by the record-breaking London Palladium stage show, this production stars Donny Osmond, Maria Friedman, Richard Attenborough and Joan Collins. A lively and colorful journey through ancient Egypt, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat follows the rags-to-riches story of Joseph, his eleven brothers and the coat of many colors. Spectacular visuals and an enchanting score packed with hit songs, including \"Close Every Door to Me,\" \"Go, Go, Go Joseph\" and \"Any Dream Will Do\" make this a dream of a show for all the family.Bonus Content: Go, Go, Go Joseph: The Making of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat Production Notes The History of Joseph The Enduring Appeal of Joseph Cast and Filmmakers Recommendations Amazon.com Following the successful 1998 video release of Cats comes another Andrew Lloyd Webber blockbuster musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and it's a savvy choice. It hasn't been represented on film before, it's short enough (78 minutes) to present without cuts, and it has the star power of former teen icon Donny Osmond, who played over 1,800 performances across North America. Rather than record a live performance, Cats director David Mallet conceived Joseph as a film, though one that is based strongly on codirector Steven Pimlott's 1991 London revival and relies more on camerawork than venturing beyond its stagelike sets. Lloyd Webber's first project with lyricist Tim Rice was originally written in 1968 as a school cantata; accordingly, this film uses a framing sequence of a school recital, with an audience of clapping, singing kids and members of the faculty playing the roles. The Old Testament tale of Joseph and his coat of many colors gets a splashy, vigorous treatment with an energetic cast, Las Vegas-style glitz, and catchy, eclectic songs, including \"Any Dream Will Do,\" \"Close Every Door,\" the peppy \"Go, Go, Go Joseph,\" and various bits of country, calypso, and Elvis. Osmond is perfect in the title role, with a strong voice and winning persona, while London stage veteran Maria Friedman performs well in the central role of the narrator. Richard Attenborough appears (and sings a little) as Jacob, and Joan Collins makes a brief, nonsinging cameo. Joseph certainly isn't revolutionary musical theater, but if you view it as a kids' show, it's a silly good time (though there are poignant moments too). Parents should note, however, that this production might warrant a little discretion due to one suggestive scene and some risqu\u00e9 costumes. --David Horiuchi Set Contains: The DVD includes a modest widescreen presentation (1.55:1 aspect ratio), DTS and Dolby Digital soundtracks, and Go Go Go Joseph, a 30-minute behind-the-scenes look at Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice, star Donny Osmond, stage director Steven Pimlott, and others provide insight on the show, its history, and the creation of the film. One point frequently stressed is that Joseph began as a school production, and as such can still coexist with large-budget professional versions. To prove the point, the film observes two British schools rehearsing and performing the show. Perhaps the most amusing segment shows numerous people--from Rice and Lloyd Webber on down--trying to recite the line \"It was red and yellow and green and brown and scarlet and black and ocher and peach and....\" Fortunately for the onscreen actors, they get cue cards!

Either we sit in the living room or office but can't watch it in family room. It is so annoying to pay for something that cannot be seen when and where you want to watch it. We bought it for our grandchildren. They love the music and the colors are great for toddlers learning their colors.I tried contacting Amazon to figure out how to get it to work on our other TVs and got nowhere fast. Lesson learned!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Over-the-top but incredibly fun musical with a wide range of music styles",
                "reviewText": "I admit, I'm a complete sucker for musicals. I know it's totally unrealistic for people to burst into song, and that it can easily jar someone out of the story if they're not used to it, but a well-written musical is just fun in my opinion even if (or especially if) it's cheesy and goofy. \"Mama Mia,\" \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" \"Hairspray,\" \"Oliver!,\" Rogers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella,\" \"Wicked,\" \"Into the Woods,\" most of Disney's animated-musical output... they're a blast. Yes, you do get a few stinkers in the mix (such as the infamous \"Carrie\" and \"Love Never Dies\"), but that's true with any genre.Although \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" is a rather... creative adaptation of the original biblical story of Joseph's coat of many colors, I find I can't nitpick the differences because it's just too much fun to watch. The fact that a good cast of actors and singers brings it to life certainly helps.The story is familiar to anyone who's read the Bible or attended Sunday School -- Joseph is the favorite son of his father, who dotes on him to the dismay and anger of his eleven other sons. Finally upset enough to act, the brothers gang up on Joseph and sell him into slavery in Egypt. But Joseph, a dreamer gifted with visions of the future, manages to work his way upward in a classic rags-to-riches story, and ends up going from slave to prisoner to a noble second only to the Pharaoh himself. The story is told in a unique format, however -- as a stage play being put on for a parochial school, with a quirky teacher serving as narrator and the children in the audience joining in as the chorus at appropriate times. And though the original story was fairly serious, here it's not played seriously at all, and is acted out with great bombast, drama, and color.I've left a review before regarding the music of this musical (under the Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1992 Canadian Cast) ), but it's worth mentioning here as well. Virtually the entire story is told in song format, and though the lyric choices are occasionally odd or sound forced, there are some clever turns of phrase and it stays surprisingly true to the Biblical story despite the wackiness and camp factor. Most of the songs are quite catchy and lively, and they cover a wide range of styles from country to disco to calypso to rock. And there are some truly beautiful and thoughtful numbers as well, such as \"Any Dream Will Do\" and \"Close Every Door To Me.\"The acting in this film... well, let's just say that nobody involved in this film takes it seriously. Everyone, from Donny Osmond as Joseph to the backup dancers serving as wives and servants, gleefully chews the Technicolor scenery in this film, hamming it up for the camera and belting out their lines with gusto. Richard Attenborough as Joseph's father and Joan Collins as Potiphar's wife were a bit of a surprise to see, but they seem to be having quite a bit of fun in this as well, and Collins in particular is delightfully slinky and sinister as the ice-cold seductress. The brothers range from okay to hilariously great -- some, like Asher and Judah, are quite memorable, while others are quickly forgotten after the film is over. The narrator has to be my favorite character -- she steals every scene she's in, somehow managing to insert herself into the action of the story on a regular basis and serving as a sort of bridge between the audience and what's happening on stage.And since I mentioned the scenery in the last paragraph... lets just say this movie looks nothing like ancient Egypt or Canaan. At times the sets look like theme-park versions of Biblical times, while at other times they're psychedelic in design and color. But given the overall tone of this musical, this wasn't particularly jarring. If anything, it just added to the over-the-top camp of the whole experience.Perhaps the greatest strength of this musical, especially this production of it, is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It's not perfect -- some of the lyrics are cringe-inducingly forced, the costumes are weird and in some cases shockingly skimpy, and it's rather obvious a few of the actors can't sing (the butler and baker are the biggest offenders here). But it's still incredibly fun and catchy, and it looks like everyone involved had a blast making it.Definitely worth your time if you're a fan of musicals in general (and Andrew Lloyd Webber in particular), though if you're looking for a serious biblical epic you're better off looking elsewhere. Probably best for ages 10 and up, due to the aforementioned costumes and some implied sensuality.",
