I went up a size to the XL and it fits me perfectly. The pockets may not be the most functional, but they\u2019ll do. The design is so unique, it stands out from the other pea coats I\u2019ve owned. It is indeed a wool/polyester blend. The person who said it was all polyester must have read the tag for the lining. Warm enough with a sweater or something thicker underneath for a Wisconsin winter.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, so I usually do not leave any reviews. But this coat became the most complimented item in my closet. I ordered it in XXL size, which usually fits me perfectly. Here I could barely close it, so I was always wearing it opened. I traveled to East Europe in October and wore it for three weeks straight every day. It was perfect for the beginning of fall and for rainy weather. I came back to Texas, and wore it occasionally when the weather got cold. And whenever I go out anywhere wearing it (back home or in Texas) I get SO MANY COMPLIMENTS I never received in my entire life. My coworkers, my friends, just random people around me. So, even though for me, it didn\u2019t fit perfectly and the material is not the best quality, I\u2019m really surprised about all this compliments and comments from everyone around me. So I definitely recommend everyone to buy it.",
