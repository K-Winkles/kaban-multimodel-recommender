It is a fitted coat so if your child doesn't like that you may want to pass. My daughter loves it! It matches everything in her wardrobe and the quilted (puffer) look is exactly what she wanted. The zipper and zipper pull is high quality and everything about the coat just looks and feels so nice!",
