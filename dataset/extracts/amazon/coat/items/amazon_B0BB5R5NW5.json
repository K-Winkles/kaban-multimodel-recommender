                "reviewText": "I live in north FL. and purchased this for an upcoming trip to Alaska in Oct. After reading the reviews I went with the Large size. BUT, being 5' 11 / 160lbs. found that it it MUCH too large for me so I am re-ordering it for a Medium.Many, MANY great qualities with this jacket. Well made but lightweight for travelling and well insulated. Velcro on the cuffs, detachable hood, drawstring on the waist and (hopefully) rain-proof are all pluses, with a nice stylish design overall.One reviewer mentioned that the pockets do not have the fuzzy lining like the hood/interior does, but I think this is actually a positive aspect. If you think about it, the moisture buildup from inserting your wet, gloved hands could cause a smell over time if they had that lining and were not properly dried. Like the interior pocket (has a zipper... BONUS) they seem to have a waterproof(?) lining. Another plus in my book.I will also be ordering one for my spouse.UPDATE: Re-ordered it in a medium. Fits perfectly!",

He had planned on needing to wear a sweatshirt as an additional layer and did not need it. He liked the inside pocket, particularly because it had a zipper - a plus. It rained one day and he did not think it was as water resistant as he would have expected. We did have problems with sizing. We first had followed the chart and that did not work but fortunately, Amazon is great with returns and getting the right size.",

                "reviewText": "My husband is 5'-7.5\" tall and about 215lbs with broad shoulders. He loves this coat and it fits him really well. It has a lot of pockets that zip and is sleek and warm. I got it to replace a nice jacket he lost and he needed a replacement. This one is great for dressing up and dressing down. He took the hood off and it's visually on par with the lost jacket but it's even warmer (bonus for Midwest winter living). Would 100% purchase again.",

Jacket is also nice and stylish, I use it every day on my walk to the office.",
