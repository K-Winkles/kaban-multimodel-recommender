We have looked at many, most of which were not lined, hung too short, etc. took a gamble on ordering without seeing and it is perfect! Lining is light, fit is great with tail being slightly longer. The best part is that it is water resistant yet still breatheable. And it looks good on.",

                "reviewText": "Super, lightweight, hooded water resistant shell. I bought one in every size for all three guys in my life. This is the small, and the model is slim, 6' feet tall, 151 pounds, 30\" waist, 36\" chest. The medium was much roomier and he prefers the small but might like the medium if wearing a sweatshirt underneath. Great layering piece for wind and a lighter rain.Comparing it to a North Face of the same style in the closet, it's really similar in style and velcro wrist closures (very nice option), but this feels a little softer and I'd reach for this one first. North Face has an extended \"bill\" on the hood which is a nicer feature, but I still really like the fit and feel of this one better.The blue is gorgeous and bright, but this one is a really nice sage color. Totally recommend this.",
