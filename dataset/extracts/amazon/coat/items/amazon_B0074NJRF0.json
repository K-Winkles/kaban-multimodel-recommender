It give me the appearance of a serious kitchen worker rather than a volunteer in street clothes. (I don't have the chef pants but who's looking down there?) This really isn't a jacket so I'll call it a \"shirt\". The 3/4 sleeve is great since I get my hands wet and I'm still able to wear gloves.I washed it and used a fabric softener before wearing it and the chef \"shirt\" is comfortable. It fits well albeit just a little large but that's a bonus working in a hot kitchen and wanting some air in between you and the \"shirt\". You won't get too hot in this and the price is right.",
