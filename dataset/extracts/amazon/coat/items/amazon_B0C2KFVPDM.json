I\u2019m 5\u20198 and 170 lbs and it looks like a million dollars! Comes right to my knees in length. Beautiful lapel, perfectly placed pockets, very chic! I bought a black one and might go back and buy another color for variety. 5 stars for sure!",

With only the one waist button, don\u2019t expect this coat to hold closed during windy winter weather, but it kept me warm in 28\u00b0 F weather. The length and the collar are perfect for that high collar or folded and warmth. The tan color is light and exactly what I wanted. The pockets are deep and satin lined, so they hold what you need and keep your hands warm.",

The color is a beautiful dark camel, it's soft, and looks way more expensive than the price you're paying. I read a lot of reviews, and because I wanted to be able to wear this over suits, I ordered a large instead of medium. Super glad I did. The button closes, still looks shapely, and not at all bulky.Side note: I'm on the shorter side, I guess, so the coat falls longer on me than the picture; just below my knees. Totally fine for me!",
