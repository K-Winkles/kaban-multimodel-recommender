                "reviewText": "I am very impressed by this coat. I'm 5'1\" (maybe?), typically a \"petite\" and of average weight for my height. Normally I would go with medium for any kind of shirt/top, but I went with a SMALL for this coat and it's perfect. Finally a dressy coat (works as casual too) that stretches!!! I can wear a thinner top without the jacket looking bulky or I can wear a thicker sweater without looking like a stuffed sausage. The stitching at the shoulders and armpits allows you to raise your arms without the entire front of the coat rising up above your face (someone out there must know what I'm talking about). The fabric keeps you warm but doesn't make you sweat. I chose the Army Green and I think it's beautiful. It's more of a deep pine color to me. The hood is slightly large on my small head but when it's down it lays nicely on the back of the coat. I saw that some people had reviews about ripped pockets and bad buttons. That's really unfortunate, but don't let that keep you from trying this coat. I had neither of those issues. The respectable price deserves a nod of approval. I hope they come out with more colors.",

It is somewhat loose in the waist and long in the arms. I have to cuff the sleeves to make them fit.",

                "reviewText": "I usually don\u2019t like buying clothes online, but I needed a new dress coat, as my old one didn\u2019t fit anymore (I gained some weight). So I found this one, read the reviews, and they weren\u2019t wrong. Its a great coat, excellent quality, great price. I sized up because I like things with a little more room. And when I received it today and tried it on it was perfect. Color, material, even the pockets were a good size. And it has a good size hood too. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "I dont usually leave reviews but I will for this jacket because I need to know all the details before I buy clothes online and I'm sure others are the same way.This jacket is amazing. It's warm and looks very classy. The only thing I don't like about it is the hood. The lining at the front is very heavy and makes the hood fall over my eyes. I just won't use it and will wear a hat instead.I'm 5'3 with a 29 inch inseam and 155 with a bit of a belly. I got a medium (suggested from other reviews) and it fits perfectly. It falls about 4 inches from my knees.Giving it 4 stars because of the hood and because there is a small hole in the pocket. I'm not sure if it came that way or I did it (although I don't put much in my pockets, just chapstick) but I'll just sew it up. It's no big deal.",
