It hangs nicely and makes even the most casual outfit look more stylish. That being said, the pockets (at least on me) hit in a super weird spot. almost behind me (as did the seem). So I was reaching back to put my hands in rather than to the side or front like most pockets would be. If you aren't a pocket user it is adorable!",

I wouldn't store anything in them as it's not really a secure pocket. I like the lapels (they add extra warmth) and the length of the sleeves is perfect. I am short, 5ft and the fact that the sleeves hit right at my wrists is amazing, coats usually swallow me up. It's warm, comfortable and I've gotten a lot of compliments already so I'm also ordering one in burgundy \ud83d\ude01",

Trust me..SIZE DOWN. I purchased a small and it is still a bit oversized. I cannot imagine if I would have ordered a medium.
