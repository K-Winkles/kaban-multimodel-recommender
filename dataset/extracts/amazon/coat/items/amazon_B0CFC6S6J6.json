                "reviewText": "I have never owned a puffer jacket before and love the Hurley brand. I prefer to buy Men's jackets bc they tend to have more features that I like. I love how deep the zipper pocket on the chest is,I put my house key and credit card there for quick access. There's a couple down sides to the jacket but I'm not going to take any stars off bc it's preference...I wish the Side pockets had zippers... they are deep so I'm not worried about my keys or phone slipping out but I just prefer zippers. The hood doesn't have a drawstring which is fine for me bc I'm not someone who uses the hood. The zipper on the chest pocket should really be the same style as the main jacket zipper bc it keeps getting stuck on the protective flap when you go to zip or unzip the pocket. There's no elastic around the sleeves but also no cheap binding around them to close the hem, which if you prefer to wear layers that's fine. I like the length. I'm 5'6\" and it covers the top part of my butt without feeling restricted when I sit down. I live in Wisconsin and I have worn a fleece jacket under it and found I was too warm, so it will definitely keep you warm. The fabric is not breathable so it does a good job at blocking wind too.",
