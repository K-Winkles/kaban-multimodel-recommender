The only thing I have a little trouble with sometimes is the zipper. So far it has been okay, but it takes awhile to get the coat zipped up. Other than the issue with the zipper, it is a nice coat for the price.",

It does fit however, I like my coats to be a little on the roomy side and sadly it fits a little snug. But, I absolutely LOVE this coat y\u2019all! I ordered the black and it is gorgeous with the gold zipper and snaps etc! The fur lining is beautiful and I\u2019m sure it will be very warm. I\u2019m going to keep it because they still don\u2019t have any more black ones \ud83d\ude15 However, I did go ahead and order the Army green color in a 2x and can\u2019t wait for it to arrive!",

As others said, good is more for style, as it's huge, with no ties. It is very warm. Only complaint is that it comes very wrinkled and there's nothing you can do but let it hang and gradually fall out.",

                "reviewText": "My wife just purchased one of these coats for the New Year and the reviews are mixed. On the positive side, it's a good looking coat and fits very well, and it's not too thick/not too thin. The inside lining is also very soft, making it extremely comfortable to wear. On the negative side, the complete lack of a drawstring to tighten the ENORMOUS hood was either a glaring oversight or intentionally done to cut corners. There are no side pockets, just the pockets on front that you see in the image. And the two pockets on the chest are fake. Also, the zippers make me nervous.The hunt for a winter coat has gone on for too long so we're throwing in the towel and keeping this one.",

Jacket length hits mid thigh or so. I can wear a sweater underneath if needed. The adjustable waistline is a great feature and creates a nicer looking fit that isn't bulky and shapeless. The lined inside is super soft and warm. Great pockets on the front, lots of space but doesn't make the coat bulk out too much. Having the options of both a zipper and a button up front allow for nice versatility. Can't beat the price for a great quality coat.",

It is quite large and flops around when up. There is a zipper so that the faux trim can be removed. The cuffs are ribbed and are not tight. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.",
