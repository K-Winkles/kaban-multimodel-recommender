                "reviewText": "I\u2019m going to preface my review by saying that I live in Wisconsin (you know, right below Canada and neighbors to Minnesota and Illinois. The ice gets ice here in the winters. If anyone knows cold weather jackets to recommend it would be me and my Midwest/Northern girls. I love this coat. Not only did it keep me warm on a December night out in Chicago, but I have quickly made it my favorite, most worn coat. It is lightweight, has a different texture to the outside shell that is neat, it\u2019s figure flattering with a belt to cinch in at the waist, folds well for travel and takes up minimal space (I fly for a living), stylish, easy to move in AND keeps me warm! It\u2019s difficult to check all of those boxes!I really can\u2019t say anything bad about it. Be aware that the front does go down low. I tried to include a picture of that. There is a zipper and snap overlay for securing the coat. You may want to add a scarf if the faux fur neckline isn\u2019t warm enough for you. I\u2019ve had no issues yet. I have noticed that when I am wearing certain fabrics that are sweater like material, I end up having some shedding from the faux fur transfer. It\u2019s easy to remove but be aware- don\u2019t wear it with a white shirt until after it\u2019s done shedding.Also, I normally wear a small/medium in tops and an 8/10 in pants. I\u2019m 5\u20196.5\u201d tall and around 160 lbs. My other coats are normally medium. I did order a large in this one and I\u2019m glad I did. I feel like I\u2019ll have a nice amount of room to wear layers or thicker sweaters and not feel restricted. It also accommodates my hips and thighs nicely. I could\u2019ve gotten away with a medium but I think L was the best choice in the end.My ONLY complaint is that I can\u2019t buy a different faux fur collar separately! I will be purchasing a second coat in a different color with a tan collar so I can interchange! That makes it 4 coats for the price of one. It\u2019s also on sale with 20% off right now. Get it!",

                "reviewText": "I already have another coat of this brand. I was looking for something warm, for outside in Indiana for my outside sales role. I love fur. I have a puffy coat but it's not too warm. This one is awesome. It's great to wear to work or take the dog out. I was dyeing my hair when the coat arrived so that explains my hair in the Pic. Anyway, the fur is so soft and nice. The material is nice and feels almost like fake leather or something on the outside. You can cinch the belt and overlap the material for a slimmer work. The coat has a zipper and snaps. Ordering it without trying it on was scary, but it really worked out. It came nicely packaged Ina fancy little zip bag. I really love it.",

I can wear sweatshirts underneath & still feel comfortable.You can tie the belt or leave it hanging. Either way is cute. It has both zipper and snap closures....no issues zipping up or down & snaps stay in place.Let's talk about inside: the top half is soft and cozy like you're wearing a comfy blanket, but not too thick.

They sent a short coat that was too big and ...short. At the hips short. The first one came to the knee. Told my daughter to return it but it's the only one she has so she is going to keep it as we went through the blizzard with a ton of snow and sub zero tempsVery disappointed and would not buy again. There were other problems with this purchase but I have reviewed what I think is most relevant. Fit tight in shoulders but otherwise was a good fit,beautiful coat, size up for overall decent fit.
