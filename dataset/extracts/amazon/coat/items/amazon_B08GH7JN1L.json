Seems well made, but havent worn but a few times. Time will tell. It is warm at 13 degrees add wind chill i was good. Two things to watch for; purchased th xl according to the size chart and was tight around waist, returned and got xxl. The circumfrence of the upper arm is larger than it needs to be in my opinion.",

I'm nearly 6'4\" and 265# and it fits me great. Length is good, sleeves are good, etc, zippers good. No complaints.",

I live in the Midwest so having a warm winter coat is essential! I love the satin lined sleeves so it is easy to get on & off over winter clothing. Honestly the only thing that is annoying is that the hood is only attached in the back by a partial zipper...the 2 ends of the hood have Velcro on them that you apparently are to use to secure them under your chin when in use...if you don't the hood just flops around because it is really large and you really have to tighten the string inside. I sew and I plan on attaching extra Velcro on the jacket near the neckline so I can just have it attached all of the time",
