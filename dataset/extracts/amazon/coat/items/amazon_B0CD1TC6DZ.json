I come to realize that when shoppingfor myself I must shop in the childs sections/areas online and in store...Thus now I shop for size 11-16 in children wear, so clothing sizes that typically 10-12 year olds wear.... I buy.Which lead me to buying this coat! I thought it would fit me to show off my figure ( the lil small figure that I do have anyways lol ) especially being that it is Childrens wear...but i was wrong\ud83e\udd74This coat swallows me\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude29However it is VERY VERY WARM,OMG\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude0dITS literally a bit heavy & hefty to even hold up in the air so the material you can tell is grade A quality.The Fur on the inside was a beautiful touch not only aesthetically speaking, but practicality wise, Very smart to add inside for the very cold winter months coming here to the midwest!The fur hood is STUNNING a great color, very full, and it looks like real fur, it frames my face & compliments me fantastically\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Another plus is that I was able to get this item the very next day after I ordered it without having to pay immidiately because of the amazon prime luxury benefit of Try before you buy option\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 I really appreciate that & indeed, it came in useful ( first time using that benefit) So this was awesome!Overall i rate this a 10 out of 10....This was an excellent, very eye pleasing & practical GOOD BUY!",
