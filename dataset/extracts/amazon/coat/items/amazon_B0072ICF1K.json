                "reviewText": "Bought this product as a backup for my white coat I use for med-school rotation. Especially needed because the white coat is used everyday and can get dirty really fast with bodily fluids.Pros- Good design: the lapel, buttons, and pockets are really well placed and looks sharp-The material is thinner than the school issued white coat. I think this is a pro because it is especially useful when running around wards and I feel I don't overheat as much. Some may take this as a poor quality issue but I haven't worn it long enough to decide.- The 3 pockets plus the internal pocket is nice. You get to carry a lot of things.- Great priceCons-the jacket runs long for short people. Not good if your a med student who is suppose to be wearing the short coat. Im 5'3 and the small hangs to the middle of my thigh- about 28.5 inches from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the coat. It's unfortunate since the coat fits really well in the shoulder, chest and hips and looks great. Since I could get in trouble wearing this length of coat, I reserve it for emergencies when my other coat is too dirtyThe coat looks great, well designed, and nicely priced. It maybe suited better for people who are a little taller.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to purchase this lab coat because of the the great reviews on here. The coat itself is very light-weight and fits great at the shoulders. However, the length of the coat was just a bit too long compared to the Landau lab coat I already have. I'm about 5'7 and average-build and this coat (medium size) ran down to my mid-thighs which looked a bit weird when compared to my other coat. I decided to return this and purchase another Landau lab coat since I knew the exact size I needed. So in my opinion, this is a good lab coat to have if you're on the taller side.",

The coat lathers my skin in warmth and all of my problems disappear, even if only for a brief second. I walked down the street the other day wearing my beautiful new lab coat and a passerby, assuming I was a chemist, asked me about a problem he had in his organic chemistry field. Out of nowhere, I knew the answer! Of course it was a triple-bond between BOTH the oxygen atoms AND carbonite ions! I have never taken a chemistry class in my life, but somehow I knew the answer. He offered me a job on the spot in his lab. My new position pays me $120,000 a year!! I made about a quarter of that amount annually as a garbage collector before buying my Dickies Everyday Scrubs Men's Lab Coat! Even better, he put me as a member of the research team working on the article, which was published just two weeks ago. Apparently the topic was pretty important because the University of Michigan offered me an honorary PhD due to my incredible contribution to the field of chemistry. In my special commencement, the President of the university offered these words: \"There is no way to improve upon that. But what we can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize our destiny.\" I don't even know what that means, but none of this would have ever happened if not for my Dickies Everyday Scrubs Men's Lab Coat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because my white coat was falling apart at the seams. I was a bit hesitant to buy this because of the brand (what could they possibly know about the utility of a medical student's white coat??). It is actually pretty great. It does suffer from the same problem as all other white coats, though. For starters, it's not fitted very well, and will look like a baggy coat on you, but whatever. My main concern is the cloth in the front part of the white coat. This is going to be hard to explain, but I'll try my best. You know the part of the blazer/white coat where you button the two sides together? On the inside of the white coat, there are these flaps of cloth that are not attached to the rest of the white coat very well. So when you go around unbuttoned, those flaps are free to stick out and look unprofessional. I personally have modified the white coat a bit, sewing the chest and sleeves of the white coat up to make it look more slim and fitted. I also took off that atrocious Dickies tag on the pocket. Oh, the pockets. They are awesome, big enough for 7inch tablets (sorry 10\" tablet users, I can't give you feedback on that). It also has one pocket on the side, in the same location as the breast pocket (just like blazers). This white coat is pretty much good to go out of the box, you will need to iron it of course (and maybe get your name on it). I am a male at 5' 10\" 175 lbs, and the medium size white coat worked for me. I would recommend this to anyone in need for a white coat (a medical student white coat, that is).",
