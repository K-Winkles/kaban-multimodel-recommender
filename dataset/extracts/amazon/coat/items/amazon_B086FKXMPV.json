I like that the fur lining on the hood can be removed, as the hood is rather big with the fur. The coat is long enough that it partly covers my thighs, and it's roomy enough to wear layers underneath. The zipper can be challenging to zip up, but if you do it slowly, it works fine. I got the forest green color, and it is really pretty. Overall, I am very happy with this coat!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this coat because it's actually going to feel like winter this year in my state, and also because it was on sale. I decided on the green, and I'm pretty happy with my choice. There are only a couple issues with the coat.The first thing I noticed is that the green isn't as dark as in the picture. It's more of a forrest green, as opposed to a really dark green. It's still pretty, though not what I originally wanted. The other problem is a bigger issue. The zipper sticks, and sometimes pretty badly. It's hard for me to get it to go up some days, which is extremely frustrating. The zippers on the pockets don't stick, just the one on the front, but that's the main one. I will say that the hood is very large, and while I like that, I know some people don't.What I do like is that the lining is super soft and the coat is very warm. I love that the (numerous!) pockets are lined with fleece, too!I would recommend this coat, and I'm happy I got it.",

I will say it fit like on the model around the hips and legs on me...loose and roomy. I will be taking of the fur. The pockets have warm mitten lining for your hands, that's a must have I like. The coat is great and I also like the cuffs on the sleeves. BUY THIS COAT.",

I do have some sewing skills and am sure I will need them for replacing the zipper at some point. I kept the coat despite these issues, don't really sure why?! Likely because it is a cute style.

So I'm 5'4, 100lbs and this coat fits perfect.I ordered the black upgraded, size 2.Not sure why other reviews say go a size up, that's not the case for the one I ordered.The sleeve length is on point.The hood is deep but not too deep, and it has a draw stringThe fur isn't top quality, but it is soft and looks decentThere are 6 pockets on the outside front of the coat; one on each side of the upper that have snaps to close, and two on each side of the lower, one with a snap and one with a zipper. The pockets are fair size and comfy.There is another pocket on the inside left that zips upThe buttons and zippers all seem to be solidThere is a string at the waist to sinch up to give the coat more of a form fit, which I did, if there was no option to sinch the waist, then the coat would almost be too big for someone with my frame .... almost.Inside the coat is a really soft material.I wouldn't be able to wear a heavy sweater under this coat, but doubt if I'd need to as it feels pretty warm, despite it being so light weight.I like the length overall, it's not really boxy and doesn't fan out but I have enough room to move, walk, drive, etc.The outer material is good too.I am confident this coat will keep me toasty whenever winter decides to come back to Calgary, AlbertaShipping was very quick too.Yeah, it's a keeper.**additional review update**I'm very happy with this coat, I've washed this coat 3x already (removed the fur,cold-warm water,normal cycle/soil level,extra spin,all zippers zipped/buttons snapped,tie each hood drawstring in a knot to avoid it coming out)the extra spin cycle is importantTurn inside out before putting in the dryer on medium heatLike new! Didn't affect the inner material at all.It shrunk a VERY TINY bit, hardly noticeable, now that it's broken in it fits and feels even better. I love all the pockets!!This coat ROCKS I've been rocking it out here on the acerage south of Calgary, AB Last week it was a hard to the core in -37(not with the windchill!!) With only a tank top under it. It's SO warm. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could",

                "reviewText": "Wasn't sure after some of the reviews. But I sure like that it is such a warm coat but is not too bulky. The length is perfect - just past the thighs & ever so slightly longer at the back.The waist cinch hits me right at the waist. The 2 way zipper is great although stiff at first - takes a few tries to get it going but fine after that. The fur was crushed but can be fluffed. On sale it was a great deal. Very happy with it. I have tried on lots of name brand jackets this season - this is by far the best fit & feel. Warmth without bulk. Very happy I took a chance on this.",

                "reviewText": "This coat is really nice, Fast shipping, I love the colour, the weight is good, not too heavy but warm and cozy on a cold Canadian winter day. I walked my dog on a -15 day with -20 windchill and was sweating by the end.It was a little wrinkled when it arrived so I had to steam it but it came up beautiful. Zipper quality is good, I like that they are silver, nice contrast on the dark grey.My only dislike is the faux fur on the collar is a little ratty and cheap looking and I do prefer to leave the fur on but I'd rather faux fur than the real thing so not a big issue. I would recommend buying this coat.",
