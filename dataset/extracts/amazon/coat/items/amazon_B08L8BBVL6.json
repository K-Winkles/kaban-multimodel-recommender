First I reached out to the seller to assure I ordered the correct size. Came pretty fast and was very excited to get it.Nicely wrapped, but had a sticker on the zipper so I could not take it out the packaging, had to cut it open,Who packs items like this.Opened then I stopped and said, is this what I been waiting for, heck NO..the material was a stretch spandex material, I thought it was to be cotton material, if I read wrong then it\u2019s my fault, if I\u2019d known it was this type of material, I sure would not have purchased it. On top of that, it was entirely too small, that darn seller informed me of the size, I also followed the sizing chart. I got the large and to be honest XL may not have fit either, that would have been too small. I\u2019m 190lbs, 38D. And NO I could not button it up either.If anyone of a larger body frame and large on top, advise you to go two sizes up. I immediately called for a quick refund and scheduled a pick up also. Tomorrow it\u2019s going back to the seller. Next time give people the correct information of your very own product.",

The buttonholes pulled when buttoned and there wasn't enough fabric, for it to close all the way especially; if you wanted the double breasted look. I ordered the coat in the size (4X) and it fits in the chest but is too long and big at the bottom. You look like you are wearing a tent on the bottom half of the coat. The arms and sleeves are too wide I will have to return the 4x. I have just ordered it in the (3X) and I will not order it again if it doesn't fit this time.",

                "reviewText": "This coat is \u201ccostume quality\u201d but it will be perfect for an art opening that I plan to wear it to. One problem, though, is it has two parallel rows of buttons as if it were \u201cdouble breasted,\u201d but the only row of button holes are placed on the edge so that the second decorative vertical row of buttons is halfway around the wearer\u2019s side and the buttoned row is on the vertical center of the wearer. I plan to wear it open so the button issue is not noticeable or I may just remove the extraneous buttons. Next, the fabric is very slick and nylon-y, like a cheap negligee, but unless someone comes up to the wearer and rubs the fabric in their fingers, the cheesy fabric can be overlooked. All in all, for it\u2019s price, it\u2019s fun for what it is.",

It is very lightweight but not see through. Perfect with all-black or all-white outfits to add a pop of color.",
