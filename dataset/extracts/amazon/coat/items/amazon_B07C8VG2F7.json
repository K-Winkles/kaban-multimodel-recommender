                "reviewText": "downgrading below review to 4 stars. why?:1. i have worn one coat only a few times, and the zipper is totally messed up. i actually noticed this soon after purchasing but was like 'i'll deal with it, after a few tries i can get it to work.' but .... now it's not working at all. i dont think the other two colors i bought have this problem but i haven't worn them much yet. i suppose they had to put in a lightweight zipper but i wish it worked bc now i have to throw away a pretty new coat.2. this coat i'm wearing, the green one, has already ripped. the fabric is thin. perhaps this comes with the territory of being ultralight? but my other ultralight jackets by 32 degrees i wear all the time have not ripped.3. i wrote below how you need to buy a separate bag to pack this in, and i did buy it. unfortunalty i forget to bring it, though i will try attaching it to my other amazon coat (I have this coat in 3 colors). but upon thinking about it, it is really annoying that they just didn't design the coat's bag correctly in the first place, making it much bigger. no one should have to buy a separate bag. i was at the museum of natural history the other day and was so annoyed i could NOT pack the coat into amazon's attached bag (i forgot to bring the separate bag i bought, and yes i should have replaced amazon's bag with mine. but the fact that i am tasked with having to buy a separate bag and replacing amazon's bag with my new one is annoying. i do not have this problem with other brands. i wouldn't buy this again unless they fix the other issues.coat is great, wish it came in prettier colors. i wear a L in sweatpants, dresses, and usually in coats in general i size up to an XL. first i got this in a L and thought it was a bit snug...i looked a bit like a stuffed sausage. then i got it in an XL and it really made me look bigger/bulkier. went back to a L and am satisfied. yes i look a bit like a stuffed sausage but id prefer that than to looking larger. even with the L, i can wear a fleece underneath and still zip it up.cons--i am almost 5'8. i wish this were about 2-3\" longer - it doesnt cover the part of my thighs that i'm not happy with, i have to wear a long t shirt.-the sack it comes with - this coat does not stuff into it. i just got a 32 degree brand jacket and that easily stuffs into the bag it comes with, in several seconds flat. this? no way. fo this coat, i had to buy \"Granite Gear AirBags Stuff Sack Set - 2 7L\" - i just guessed on the 7 liter size and wham, was lucky, this coat stuffed right into that. wish this came with a bigger stuff sack so i didn't have to buy expensive stuff sacks on my own.-i'm not a fan of the colors. i wish it came in tan, a pink, and a prettier shade of blue. i was kind of shocked they don't have a basic tan color. i can see how people get addicted to these - i am keeping the black, the green, and the red, but i'm not in love with the red, i wish it were more of a cherry red.-i wish this were just a tad more shapely, with a more defined waist and a bit of a flair, but that's just me, i'm super feminine. this isn't bad, it's certainly better than how uniqlo looked on me. i have curves.pros-really is lightweight, and in mid 30 degree weather in NYC, i wore a fleece under this, and was warm enough!this has got me obsessed with the idea of travling light. also when you wear it you can feel the lightweightness of it it's like a freeing feeling. i have a bigger, much heavier down coat and this isn't QUITE as warm as that, so i will save that one, but this definitely makes me feel light and free while still keeping me warm.-pockets are nice, i put my hands in them and they stay warm-portability. again, i was annoyed i had to buy a separate stuff sack for this, but i can see how, when i travel from nyc to florida, it will be really, really nice to be able to stuff this in a little bag rather than schlep it around.so i am keeping these, but i also am going to try the 32 degree brand bc they have longer coats, and one in tan. i'll probably end up keeping ALL of them. just in love.",

                "reviewText": "Coat is alright. Decent length but more snug of a fit than I prefer and I purchased it in the same size that I always do in Amazon Essentials. My big problem is the pockets. The outside pockets are okay. They could be a bit larger and lined for warmth. The bigger problem is that there is a panel on both sides of the front interior and I assumed they were long pockets. So stoked! I threw my phone in and it slid right out the bottom. I couldn\u2019t believe it. The two panels are sewn in place on the sides but not at the bottom. I considered just getting the bottom sewn but then I realized after seeing it once that the zippers are cheap and thin. A coat needs a nice zipper. The zipper on this coat is thin with tiny teeth and it gets caught on the fabric repeatedly. Too bad!",

Purchased a large looking for something that wouldn\u2019t be too oversized but would allow me to wear a sweater underneath. This works perfectly!Roomy pockets, which is always important.Love that this can be folded up and placed in its bag to save space. Im able to easily put this in my work bag to stay prepared since it folds up easily and comes with its own storage bag. I also take this with me on hikes since temperatures drop as elevation increases. Easy to throw in a backpack and pull out when needed.If you\u2019re on the fence, give this a shot. I think you\u2019ll be presently surprised!",
