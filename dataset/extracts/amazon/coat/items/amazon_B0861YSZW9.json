The back is a tad bit longer to cover and not go up if you bend over. Nice purchase at reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "The title of my review sums up this jacket. I love the look and color of the jacket and the furry inside makes the jacket very warm. I was able to wear very lightweight clothing underneath and still be plenty warm, even in single digit temperatures. I like that the sleeves don\u2019t have the fuzzy lining - it is a more slick fabric which makes it so much easier to put on and take off the jacket while wearing long sleeve shirts. I also appreciated the cuff at the end of the sleeve which helped keep the warmth in the sleeves. The jacket definitely doesn\u2019t pack down like a less bulky down jacket, but it is light enough that I just wound it through the bungee cords on my backpack to carry it if I wasn\u2019t wearing it. Sizing seems to be spot on. XL is what I normally wear and the XL fit perfectly. I ordered the XXL to try on too and it definitely looked baggy and less cute/fitted. If you want to wear bulky clothes like sweaters underneath, you may need to go up a size so the sleeves can accommodate that, but I found the jacket to be so warm that I never wanted more than a lightweight shirt underneath.",

I ordered the navy blue and the color is nice but my favorite thing is how big the pockets are. A lot of coats have small pockets and your gloves always fall out, but this one has nice big pockets to keep your hands toasty and stuff won't fall out of them. The hood is perfect too. Zipper seems sturdy. One thing though, is that I washed it once and I did notice a couple of snags so next time I will turn it inside out when I wash it. But i love it and it was a great sale price!",

                "reviewText": "I love this jacket so much I bought it twice. The first one I bought in my usual size and was surprised because it felt slightly too big, so I bought it again - without returning the first one - in a size down. That one fit better, but I love them both so much I am not returning the big one! I'm just going to use the bigger one for working in the yard or mucking about around the house or when it is super cold and I want to layer a bunch underneath. The one that fits a little more tailored I'll wear out when I want to look a little more put together or when it is warmer and I don't need to layer as much underneath. This jacket feels very well made, it's super comfortable and warm. It's not as loud as other puffer jackets, which I really like a lot. The zippers are quality. The sherpa-style warm lining has not come off on my clothes. Also I am able to slip it off and on over my Columbia and other brands of zippered fleece jackets with no problems. It goes on and off smoothly without any tugging or issues. I love the pockets and I especially love the sleeves and the cuff part at the wrist. The hood is great and doesn't come down over my face. I washed them both in cold and dried on low in the dryer and there were no issues. They are soft and warm and really just great jackets. I bought the ones that says they are navy with pink flowers, but to me is looks more like black or maybe a very dark navy with fall or autumn leaves or something... whatever it is, it's super cute! :) It's nice to have a jacket that isn't boring basic black like all my other ones but also isn't a bright bold color. I've tried white jackets in the past but they always start looking dingy or dirty after awhile. So this one with the cute botanical pattern is lovely and a refreshing change. I'm very happy with my purchase and might try to buy some more as gifts for friends and family.",

Current temp is 20\u00b0F and it's perfect. Hidden cuffs around wrists. Super soft lining though hood & body, slick lining inside sleeves. Would definitely buy again!",

I also really like the cuff on the sleeves - very comfortable. The fit is nice, not too bulky in the shoulders and sleeves. However, I want a jacket that looks good on me when zipped up and this is not it. The pockets have the same fuzzy lining as the front body of the jacket so when zipped- there\u2019s a triple layer of thick fluff in the pocket/front and it adds too much bulk on me and looks pretty bad. Two layers of fluffy lining in the pockets and a layer of fluffy lining in the jacket body is not flattering.",
