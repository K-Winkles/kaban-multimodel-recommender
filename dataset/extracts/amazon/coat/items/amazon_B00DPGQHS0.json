No sewn seams to pull apart and leak and a good size. I'm 6'4\" and thin. The XL fits well with enough room for heavy winter clothes under it. My only gripe is the way it closes which is by snaps. It tends to pop open but I'm not sure how I could make it better. The snaps are better than a zipper IMHO. I also got the Mandel bibs in size L and with this combination and some wellingtons I can work outdoors all day in driving rain and my clothes stay dry. Much better than some of the other garbage rain gear I've tried.",
