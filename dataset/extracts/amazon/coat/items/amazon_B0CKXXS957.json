I also consider computers/laptops vary in color schemes so perhaps that is why it was slightly different!",

I love how good it looks and the color is just what I wanted. The size is just right, allowing room for extra layers underneath, as advertised, but not looking bulky. I appreciate its sleek, feminine look. I also LOVE the big, deep outer pockets and that it has inner pockets too.",
