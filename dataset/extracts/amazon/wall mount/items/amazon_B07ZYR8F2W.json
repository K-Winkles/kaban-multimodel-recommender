                "reviewText": "Better than expected if you need a simple reasonable basic Mount. Doesn't take up much room. Just simple wall mount. Pro is it gets the TV as close as possible to the wall. Con not much room to manipulate wires. I would recommend this for more of a simple bedroom TV without a bunch of cables. Living room TVs you need to have a little bit more room and maneuverability but works amazing for bedroom clean look basic mounts in my opinion anyway.",

Used some cable raceways to hide the cables from the TV to the media center (not gonna run cables through the wall in an apartment) and it looks like a professional did it!",

                "reviewText": "Like it being a solid mount but the bracket could be longer because my location to mount in the middle of the wall did not let me hit all but 1 stud in the center of the bracket and my studs are 16\" center. So the 2 on the outside part of the bracket I had to use bolts that are made for hollow walls. My opinion not as strong as studs. Otherwise it's a very close mount to the wall. Make sure you lengthen the quick release rope to be able to unmount the tv or let the TV come away from the wall so you can get to your inputs and such on the back of your TV.",
