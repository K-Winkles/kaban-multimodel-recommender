Holding tight a week after install with no sag or issues of any kind. Very easy to mount the TV. Make sure you have the tilt bolts tightened before you mount the TV though! Was not very easy to do it afterward. But we got it done.",

                "reviewText": "Does what it is supposed to do and was easy to install as it has a \"hanger\" type thing to mount to the back of the TV and hang on the wall mount - i.e., you don't have to hold up the TV to the wall mount while screwing it on. Thus made it much easier and safer to get the job done.",
