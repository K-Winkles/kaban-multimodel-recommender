That being said, they are perfect for mounting TV inside of RV trailers (just make sure at least one of the fasteners anchors to a stud). They've got a great range of motion and allow for plenty of adjustment so that you can change the viewing angle in the event that you're in a small space and need to maneuver the screen to accommodate visitors.",

I could build a better mount out of 2X4's and bailing wire!",

Extremely poor design. My tv weighed about 40lbs and the mount wouldn\u2019t tighten to keep the tv facing straight ahead. (Level)",

It just kept tilting forward no matter how many times i try to adjust, remove and remount again. It's also a pain to install on a 400 x 200 vesa configuration. Jesus Christ I have never had such a problem with a mount before but this one came with every problem under the sun.- Tilts forward- Missing screws/materials- Flimsy extender plates- Arm bends cause it can't even handle the lightest of tvs- etc. etc. etc.After my 12th try to remove, reinstall, readjust and remount I just gave up and that's hard for me to say cause even on a broken product I try my best to find workarounds but this one, no matter how many workarounds I've tried it just didn't work. Now I have holes on a wall that I need to plaster and repaint.Returning, hope I can get my money back for this thing but man I have never been so disappointed in a tv mount product as much as this one.Had high hopes for it but was let down ;-(",
