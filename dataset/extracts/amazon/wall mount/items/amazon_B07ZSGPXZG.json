                "reviewText": "A few weeks ago, my son gave me a 32\" flat screen what he was tired of stepping over in his apartment. After lots of research and reviews, I settled on this wall mount for my garage. I cannot be happier. It comes with more hardware than needed depending on what size TV you have. The directions are easy to follow and it does not take long to assemble. I do not recommend hanging the tv yourself as the directions say, but I did anyhow. My tv weighs 31.7 lbs. I had to stand on my work bench in the garage to mount the bracket and tv and it went well.",

                "reviewText": "There are many other full motion TV mounts that do the same and cost more than 3x as much... why pay more?You\u2019ll need: a stud finder, a pencil to mark the borders of the stud and where you want to drill the holes, a drill with a (5/17th - I think) drill bit to pre drill the holes for the mounting stud screws, a socket socket wrench to drive in the stud screws - or if you have a ratcheting socket wrench or socket driver then even better.Was surprised that despite the low cost, it even came quipped with several different sizes of threaded bolts to accommodate most TVs, a small wrench to dial in the leveling bolts, an extra usb cable, a small level, and even a nice Velcro strap for cable management. Took me about 20 min to install. I\u2019m not what you would call a craftsman, by any stretch, nor did I try to set any time record. This was me, a layperson equipped with the neccessary tools, reading the simple directions, and being methodical in my approach. Easy peasy.I didn\u2019t receive anything free, or any other form of compensation to write this review. If the TV mount falls off my wall, or reveals any defects/drawbacks I overlooked, I\u2019ll come back to update my review. But so far I\u2019m super happy with my purchase and would recommend this to everyone else looking for a full motion TV wall mount.",

The mounting mechanism is extremely simple to install by yourself as long as you can lift your TV. I had this kit out of the box, attached to the wall and the TV, and fully installed by myself in about 20 minutes. It is very sturdy and well worth the purchase price. I chose to use Tapcon screws as this was installed directly to masonry in an outdoor mount. I would highly recommend this product - it is great quality for the price paid!",
