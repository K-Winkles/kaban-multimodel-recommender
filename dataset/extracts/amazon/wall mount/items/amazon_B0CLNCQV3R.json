I realized I desired the option to tilt the screen for optimal viewing, since the old mount couldn't. I also did not like how the old one required long Philips screwdriver to access the security-safety bolts in order to mount and remove the TV from the wall.The addition of lock release pull tabs for the Pipishell mount made moving the TV and aligning it less of a task. Each person reaches down and pull and the TV releases and it can be lifted off. Simple!All the materials are high quality, fit and finish very good. And all necessary hardware to hang the mount is included. Everything is provided to install the mount properly, even a small carpenter's level. You just need your drill and drivers.Just locate the studs in the wall, secure to them and then bolt the VESA mounting arms to the TV. And you are ready to hang your big TV securely.The built-in tilt is just enough to aim the TV the couple degrees left or right and down to get the viewing angle right for your seating.This unit provides all the features I need and I'm very happy with my purchase. Satisfaction!",

                "reviewText": "Had to be in the shop last weekend and wasn't able to watch my team in the playoffs - Not going to happen tomorrow.The Pipishell Tilt TV Wall Mount arrived yesterday afternoon - put her up today The install was super easy. The mount comes with a library of instructions, but they're not needed. Once you look at this the install process is very intuitive. The cardboard vessel it arrived in is smaller than I imagined it would be, and that is because the mounting base that screws to the wall comes in 3 pieces ( two wings and a center plate) - See Photo. Just put them together and twist two nuts on the bolts that are already attached to one of the wings. They even include a wrench with correct socket so you don't have to go digging through your tool bag. Once assembled screw her into studs on wall, fasten the arms to TV with included machine screws, and hang her up. There are a couple spring latches that also need to be latched to the bottom lip on the frame - easy - not worth explaining. Also it is very easy to tilt and swivel - mine is doing both.5 Stars for The Pipishell Advanced Tilt TV Wall Mount",

Find the studs in the wall, use the installation diagram to hang on the wall to drill the holes, and follow the instructions for the easiest installation. I always get nervous with wall mounts because you are basically putting your trust in something to hold one of the most expensive items in your home! This mount is AMAZING! It feels very sturdy and holds our TV perfectly. It tilts nicely into the positions that we want and still feels very sturdy on the wall. Very pleased with this mount!",

                "reviewText": "I've lost count of how many TVs I've mounted to walls and how many different types of mounts I've used, but this is definitely one of the best. The instructions were very clear, all of the required components were included, and installation was especially simple thanks to the included template. This was the first mount I've used that came with a template, and it's significantly easier to mark hole locations when you're holding a piece of paper compared to holding up the actual mount. The 65\" TV that it is holding up feels secure and can easily be tilted/moved as desired.",
