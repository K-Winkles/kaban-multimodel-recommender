                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings about this tv wall mount. On one hand this was the simplest and easiest tv wall mount I have ever installed, but it also looks questionable in its ability to hold up the weight of the tv. The installation process was super easy. All I had to do was find where I want to install the tv and start hammering the tv mount into place. The trick part was leveling the mount and the rest was a piece of cake. I didn\u2019t know what to do after it was installed because in the back of my mind I couldn\u2019t believe how quick and easy it could be because I was used to using the traditional tv mounts where you have to find the studs and drill some holes for the anchors and stuff. I haven\u2019t up my 65\u201d tv yet as I have read some reviews of other branded stud less mounts failing on people. I\u2019m planing on mounting an older 49\u201d tv on it first to see how well it holds up. Hopefully things go well and I can actually install my 65\u201d tv soon after. Will try to update if something catastrophic happens to my tv.",

                "reviewText": "I used this to mount a 50 inch TV in our bedroom. It was very easy to mount and I'm confident my TV won't fall down. It's well built and takes the least amount of space behind the TV.I appreciate the option to mount without needing to find wall studs. It's good to know that you'll likely find studs during the installation. Here is why. Basically the TV mount would have you hammer in about 2 dozen nails in the mount. Each nail helps add strength in the absence of studs, so it does not fall from the wall. Most houses have studs every 16 inches. Since the mount has you putting a nail almost every inch, you'l likely hit a few studs along the way. I just found my studs and used screws to mount his thing instead. Worked great and I put less holes in my wall.Here is a tip, find how high and where on the wall you want it. Hammer in 1 nail, then level it perfectly and put in another nail several inches away from the first one. Then finish mounting it how you like. Be sure the thing is perfectly level, so that you TV will also be level.",

                "reviewText": "First things first. It's a lot of nails to install. Use this for my 43\" TV and it's nice. Very low profile mount and easy to install. It's a love/hate situation with the nails. It's a lot. And when I actually leveled this thing, once I hammered the first nail, the whole mount moved down, so I had to adjust again. This keps happening a lot the first few nails. I would recommend to hold this mount really hard when you're hammering those first few nails. Other than that, the work con for me is that it's hard to full drive the nail in cause you start hitting the mount instead. Maybe im just using a big hammer, but that annoyed me a lot. ended up not fully hammering some of the nails.",
