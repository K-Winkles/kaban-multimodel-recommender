                "reviewText": "The product itself was really easy to put together - it was really only like 4 pieces. The hardest part (as with any mount) is finding the wall studs. The screws provided for the TV mount are rather large (1/4in in diameter or so), so making sure you find the center of a stud is pretty vital. But once you've got that figured out and the holes drilled, its very easy to put up.Thing I like:- Price is great- Easy to assemble- Feels sturdy and well attached to the wall- TV can slide a little left and right on rails, so you can make minor adjustments on where you want it- Hugs the wall pretty well (an inch or so between the wall and TV)- Parts included: screws to mount TV, screws to mount to wall, washers and spacers, and small level that is magnetic so that it sticks to the mount as you're putting it upThings that I didn't like:- The directions were a bit funny to look at-The straps to unhook the TV from the mount hung below the TV after mounting. You'll want to adjust those before mounting. I ended up just using painters tape to put them behind the TV, rather than pulling the large TV off myself",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the 5-star rated Low Profile TV Mount for my 65-inch TV, and I couldn't be happier with the product. Installation was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions and included hardware. The low-profile design is exactly what I was looking for, as it keeps my TV snug against the wall, giving my living room a clean and modern look.The sturdiness of this mount is impressive. I had concerns about my large TV, but it holds it securely in place without any wobbling. The included bubble level ensured a perfectly straight installation, which is crucial for optimal viewing.What I appreciate most is how this mount allows for easy access to ports and cables behind the TV, making maintenance and adjustments hassle-free. Plus, it provides peace of mind with its robust build quality.Overall, this Low Profile TV Mount has exceeded my expectations. It's an excellent investment for anyone looking to maximize their viewing experience while maintaining a sleek and unobtrusive look in their living space. I highly recommend it to anyone with a 65-inch TV or similar size; it's a top-quality product that deserves its 5-star rating.",
