                "reviewText": "My PS3 is currently sitting on the media stand behind my TV, and it is not as accessible as I would like. I saw this mounting bracket and eagerly placed my order. The package arrived quickly, and they did a wonderful job packing and protecting it from any damage. The stand/mount was placed in a bubble wrap bag, and the screws and drywall anchors were kept together in a small ziplock bag. I was very surprised at the weight of the mount, which seemed a bit excessive, relative to the actual weight of the PS3. Instead of mounting on the wall, though, I decided to just keep it in the mount and utilize it more like a stand, which the weight now plays in my favor. The weight allows the PS3 to stay in a stable and vertical position, and I'm really happy with it. I like how the USB charging cable for the controllers installs in the cut-out port in the stand, as does the power cord, which in the end, makes kind of a lock and key method of keeping the PS3 in the mount/stand; I find this to be an extra bonus! I'm very happy with this mount, even with the repurposing of it like I did. I happily recommend this for other PS3 users. Two thumbs up!",

                "reviewText": "The mount itself is made from a sturdy metal, that isn't too thick, installation is fairly easy, all you need is a bubble level, a pencil, and a driver/drill. I personally opted to using higher quality screws and wall anchors as the default ones manufacturers are obligated to provide with products like this, are generally not good quality.Once installed the PlayStation 3 slim fit in perfectly, not too snug, and not loose at all. My only complaint is the price point (25.99 at the time of reviewing), Personally I think it's somewhat high for what comes down to a piece of metal, some cheap screws, and wall anchors.",
