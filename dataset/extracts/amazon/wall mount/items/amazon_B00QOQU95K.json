                "reviewText": "I know what you are thinking. Best value on a simple little mount. How? I have purchased abotu 10 mounts in my life. From pricey $100 mounts at retail stores to cheapo $30 mounts on amazon.Every single one of these mounts seemed like too much for the item. On all of my mounts the metal is cheap with the paint flaking off during installation. The screws feel cheap. The included level is usually a garbage piece of plastic that you just throw away. Marking the right measurement is normally difficult..moving parts feel forced and not very smooth. I always end up saying ugh why are these so expensive.Enter this Mounting Dream kit. It looks solid. It feels solid. It included everything you need and the included hardware is solid. It was super easy to measure for and mount. Even the included little cheapo level seemed well thought out as it is super lightweight, magnetic, and so small it never moved around or fell. I installed a 50\" t.v. in a matter of 30 minutes with an impact drill and stud finder.What makes this mount stand out is the brilliant design. It slides left and right about 7 inches leaving room for error. The little straps at the bottom are brilliant, when placing the actual t.v. on the mounted bracket you it literally was as easy as setting it and forgetting it.Even the simple idea of having the logo printed on the frame means you don't even have to ask yourself if it's upside down. Seriously, such a simple yet brilliant design idea.Buy this mount. It doesn't tilt, it doesn't move, it doesn't look fancy..it is just a simple mount that does it's job well. And it was less than the taxes I paid for when purchasing my t.v.!",

                "reviewText": "So when you spend this little on a product your expectations are not the highest. I knew my TV had a 400x400 mount and that it would fit but that this was also the max.So I got out my stud finder, picked the studs I was going to used and got to work. First off, the instructions were decent. I mean, it is pretty obvious, drill 4 pilot holes and lag em in but it is nice that if someone has no skills they can use this. It also tells you everything down to the screw size.It came with a very small level but I used my own for marking the studs which I recommend as the one they included was tiny.I really like how the rails clip on to the mount and are quite secure. I honestly feel like I could hang off of this thing which is good because my 50 inch plasma is heavy.Now the cons.Even with the spacers, this thing is pretty close to the wall. If you have side ports on your TV or a recessed cable area you are OK. When I have the VGA port from my computer in it wont lock into the mount on one of the rails. You could cut a small hole in the wall but just keep in mind if your cables stick out far it's going to be tough. You also have to remove the TV from the mount every time you change a cable, so get it ready with the cables in the back BEFORE you mount it to the wall. I put an extra HDMI cable in there and cable tied it in an area I can pull it down when I need it to not have to remove it later. (it is pretty easy to remove, pull the straps and lift.Over all I give it 5 stars. You cant beat the price and it is secure. Just make sure you are aware how close to the wall it is. You could make your own spacer and go to a hardware store and get 4 longer machine screws for your TV if you were so inclined. A 1/2 inch would make a big difference for your cables.",
