The mount came with extenders which gave me flexibility to mount it where I wanted on the wall and be able to find studs. I didn't mount it exactly level but was able to adjust the TV after it was mounted with the adjusting plate that were easy to adjust. It fits snuggly against the wall and also pulls out far and rotates so we can watch it from the other room. Great product. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Mounted 65\" 6 Series TCL. Came out perfect. Mount is excellent, very strong, easy to adjust. Instructions are great. Definitely consider if the vesa screw holes are in the middle of your TV or towards the bottom and factor that in when determining how high off the ground the mount should go, otherwise your TV may wind up too high. I took an extra few minutes to measure it all out (my VESA screw holes were towards bottom of TV) and I subtracted a few extra inches or so from the height I wanted the center of my TV and it came out right where I wanted it because this 6 series TCL hangs higher than a TV with vertically centered vesa screw holes. Nominal height is suggested 42\" for center of TV. I put my center of TV around 48\" off the ground.You can definitely hang with one person because after you get the mount up, you basically hook the TV onto the mount and then clamp it in. However, when you hook the TV onto the mount, the TV will tip forward under its own weight unless you first turn the arms/levers on the mount to tighten the mount into a vertical position before you put the TV on it. If you do that first then hook the TV onto the lateral bar you could let go (at your own discretion) and screw the clamps into place to lock the TV onto the mount. You need to use a screwdriver to tighten the clamp and lock the TV onto the mount.ONE DRAWBACK FOR BIGGER TVS: If you need to angle TV significantly you may want to opt for mount with longer arm. The bigger the TV the less you will be able to angle without it bumping into wall. In the pic this was the maximum I was able to angle my TV. I do wish I could squeeze a few more degrees out of it.",

                "reviewText": "The good:Once you get this installed, it's very nice. I used this one on a 65\" Roku TV and I'm 100% confident that it's not going to fall off the wall. The motion is very smooth for swiveling and pulling away from the wall. You can't swivel a 65\" TV too far without the need to pull it away from the wall a little, and this mount handles this motion flawlessly. This was important to us since we swivel it often when going back and forth from our kitchen and family room. Tilting is very easy to set but note that once you set it, the only way to change it is to loosen a couple of screws. I think setting the tilt motion once and forgetting it is actually a good thing because otherwise it would probably start drifting over time.The Bad:The only reason I took one star off is because of the safety lock design. While it is sturdy, it is a little bit of a pain while installing. The latch keeps flipping down while the TV tilts forward. You almost need a 3rd person to feel safe while doing this. Two to hold the TV while the 3rd person uses both hands to hold the latch up and insert a screw.This is the 6th Mounting Dream bracket I have purchased over the years and all the other ones have a simple (and sturdy) safety lock system which uses two long set screws which are already in place and only need to be turned a bit to prevent the TV from tilting forward. Much easier to install and just as sturdy. I only went with this model because I wanted a 600mmx400mm max VESA pattern to future proof it a bit.",

                "reviewText": "This mounting system is probably heavier duty than I needed, but that's NOT a criticism at all. Solidly built, with clear instructions. A nice coating (perhaps powder coating?) so no risk of deterioration/rust. My particular system allows for full turning side to side and pulling out quite substantially. The only aspect that requires a little more tweaking on my part is the vertical angle, and Mounting Dream includes a small wrench to do so if needed (though once you set your vertical angle, I'm not sure it's necessary to change it). I've never needed to change it.One aspect to consider: installation may be daunting for some. You MUST find your studs with a decent finder and plan your install carefully (which a person should do anyway: remember the old adage: measure twice, cut/drill once). Mounting Dream also includes instructions for effective visual placement.Excellent piece: I would highly recommend.",
