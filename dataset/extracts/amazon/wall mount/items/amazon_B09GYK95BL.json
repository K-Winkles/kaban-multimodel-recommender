Saw some reviews about this mount not fitting some TVs, but this is exactly as advertised and makes me think some people were lead astray due to this platform\u2019s less-than-perfect search and filtering system. If your tv or monitor supports a 100x100mm VESA mounting bracket, this should work. Check your TV/Monitor specs before you buy if you\u2019re not sure what size you need. It\u2019s also relatively smooth to adjust my monitor\u2019s angle. I have zero complaints for such an affordable mount!",
