                "reviewText": "This was my third wall mount purchase from Mounting Dream. The first two installed without issue, and what I like about the wall mounts is how straightforward they are to install, and how they do exactly the job they say they'll do. They hold up my TVs without any issue and easily adjust to whatever position I feel like, and this helps with glare on the screen that can change depending on the time of day and the ambient light in my house. The mounts I got came with a 2-axis level and a hole template which made installation very easy. Some other mount brands have templates that don't line up to the actual holes on the mount, however this is easy to double check by just placing the template onto the mount and verifying the hole spacing before marking anything on the wall: exact match. All the mounts came with nice velcro strips for cord management, and the large mount I ordered (not this item) also came with an HDMI cable, which were nice extras. Overall, you get exactly what you expect out of these TV mounts and they're not expensive at all. There's really no reason to drop all that coin on other mounts when they don't offer any extra for that money. Maybe the only way they could improve these is if they had a molded plastic cover for the part of the mount that attaches to your wall...but I prefer the cheap price and the mount is behind the TV anyway. Adjusting the TV is super easy, in/out and swing left/right is as easy as lightly tugging on the TV and it moves. Up/down swing and leveling adjustment is very simple with the included Allen wrench, and that usually only has to be done before first use and can be left alone after.Just make sure you're attaching the mount directly to a stud or into a concrete wall so your TV will be secure. Never mount into just drywall for the safety of you, your family, and at the very least your TV.The real reason you should buy these mounts though, is the customer service. The most recent mount I ordered (this item) came with a faulty part. The plate that attaches to the back of the TV had a couple messed up holes that made it impossible to complete a secure installation. This could have been a problem, but when I emailed Mounting Dream directly, they answered me back in less than 12 hours even though it was the weekend. After explaining what happened, they offered to send me replacement parts free of charge and shipped them immediately the next business day. The entire time during shipping, they were in constant communication about the status of the package, well past what I think would be the minimum required. When I received the replacement parts, they were in perfect condition and completely solved my issue. I didn't have to send back the damaged parts or do anything beyond send them a picture along with my original issue, which was easy. Now my TV is up on my wall and I can game comfortably reclined with this sturdy mount holding my TV up. I highly recommend Mounting Dream TV mounts because they will jump to help you with any issues you have with your TV mount. You can even message them on Facebook for basic installation help.",

Easy to maneuver after mounting. Level adjustments are easy too. The provided level is not the best to see, as it is dark blue liquid in a black colored level. Not bad in a pinch but recommend you use a better quality level. Otherwise, highly recommend this mount.",

                "reviewText": "I've hung several different TV mounts in the last couple of years. I'm by no means an expert but I know the features that I like. This mount has all of them.The articulating arm mounts to the wall first. The wall plate is well thought out-- install the upper and lower screw but leave them loose. The lower mounting hole is slotted so you can adjust the plate to be level, then tighten the whole thing down. You can then install the center screw. If you lag the arm into a wall stud like I did, you can practically hang an engine on it.Install the mounting plate on the TV, then hang the TV on the end of the arm. The mounting plate slots onto the end of the arm and can hang there freely while you tighten the mounting screws. This is a nice touch-- another mount that I recently used required a screw to be installed while you held the TV in place, which is hard to do by yourself. Yep, I almost dropped it. This mount avoids that particular problem.After the TV is hung and bolted down, you can adjust the tilt and level. Again, this is pretty straightforward to do. Every adjustment on the arm is well thought-out and easy to perform.This is the best mount I've used so far. What's even better is that the price as of this writing ($29ish) is on par with other mounts that are less sturdy and aren't as easy to mount or adjust. I should know, I've bought a few (unfortunately).Next time I need to hang a TV (it's only a matter of time-- I'm a magnet for \"favors\"), I'll be buying this one again.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good quality mount best suited for offices but if you're not constantly adjusting the tilt (must be unlocked, relocked with allen key) and extension (swinging jointed arm, not spring) it's fine for home use. Instructions are clear and simple, includes huge variety of screws and washers as well as plate-arms to accomidate all the form factors I know of. It just seems solidly engineered. DON'T DO THIS UNLESS... But: I was forced to mount this on 3 horizonal studs spanning 6\" instead of the 1 verticle stud it is designed for using only 2/3 bolts but as my TV is only 1/3 of the maximum weight I decided to go ahead and after throughly weight testing I went ahead with mounting without issue (though I later added a little extra security with drywall anchored screws in the remaining slot). Again, I do not recommed this and it will void the manufacturer's warrantly, but it is engineered well enough to push the stated design limits. All tools needed are included, though I would recommend an actual torque wrench and stud finder.",
