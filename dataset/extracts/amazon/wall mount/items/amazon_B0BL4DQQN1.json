At this point in the steps the TV is up and you have less than an inch to screw a screw into a tiny hole that\u2019s a foot above the edge of the TV. And the hole is blocked by the screws you\u2019re used to attach the brackets to the back of the TV. Even if you had a long enough screwdriver, the screws would be blocked. I\u2019ve mounted at least a dozen TVs and monitors on walls before and have never seen a feature like this. Do not buy.",
