The installation was relatively simple and well organized and very well documented. They include pretty much everything that you might need to make the bracket work with your TV: an assortment of screws of different sizes to match the screw mounts on the back of your TV. The bracket is very solid...a bit heavy, but it's well made. They pretty much though of everything in the design of this product right down to the cutaway on the back next to the lag bolt hole so that you can screw it into the wall all the way down to the plate. They even have cutouts in the shape of arrows in the metal of the wall bracket so that you know which way is up when mounting the bracket.A very quality product. Well worth the extra few $$ over the price of a cheap-@$$ discount version. Take my advice -- spend the extra $10-$15.",

                "reviewText": "i got this tv wall mount for my samsung 65 in oled tv. i put in a lot of thought before applying this set up. this had high ratings and the price was too good to stay away from. installation/instructions were easy to follow and the parts came in excellent condition. the only issue i had was on my end with the spacing of my wall. i had already measured the spacing of my \"studs\" with a magnet stud finder and it measured 16\" apart, but when i started drilling, only one side had a stud, and i drilled right through the drywall on the other side. i ended up picking up a wall anchor toggle (metal, that holds up to 250lbs) from lowes and it held the mount fine. after that, everything else went smooth. although one thing i would advise is also leveling the front part (with the arms) because it does not say to level it in the instructions. to be honest, i was hesitant to finally mount my 65inch tv because it was heavy. my forearms still felt the pain 2 days later. my 65 inch tv weighs 52.2 lbs according to google. it may sound light for a tv, but manuevering that weight at that size required another person to help me. once we had the tv hooked on the mount with the brackets, the tilting bolts were already loose, so the tv was tilted all the way to the front. this was impressive because it showerd how strong the mount was even when the tv was leaning forward, away from the wall.overall, i am satisfied with my purchase and overall mounting setup because i normally do not like mounting tv, especially in apartments bc it feels permanent and i am the type to like to move furniture around from season to season, but my living apartment design does not have give many spacious arrangements, unless we mount the tv where we have it now. 5/5 recommended for anyone who wants a practical tv wall mount that swivels and tilts. i believe if your tv is over 50 inch, you should get the swivel function because i know it would be tough to deal with wiring for a tv that is bigger, so swiveling gives you better access. also, the stability is outstanding while i tilt, swivel and pull forward the tv. knowing the weight of the tv, i look at it mounted and i am really impressed with the stregnth and support of this tv wall mount.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was easy, especially if you have another person to help hold things for measuring. You can still install this by yourself, but it just helps to have a second person. It comes with a lot of extra screws depending on the type of TV you have. It moves with ease if you have to turn the TV to the left or right. Tilting is easy to adjust, but I would definitely have a second person to help with that. It will be hard to hold the TV's position, while you try to tighten the screw in the back.",
