                "reviewText": "This mount is only about 12 inches wide. It's about the size of a license plate. If your studs are 16 inches apart it may not be for you.Unfortunately this mount did not work for me. But I'm still rating it at four stars because it does exactly what it was supposed to and the problem was my TV, not the mount. It was cheap, easy to assemble and a breeze to mount to my wall. The only reason it didn't work for me is because the back of my TV bulges out about an inch and a half on the bottom and because of this I could not attach the security screws to the bottom of the brackets. I wasn't comfortable leaving my TV on the wall without it being secured, so I took the mount down and went with another, FAR more expensive brand.If the back of your TV is flat, and it's inputs come out the bottom or the sides and not straight out the back, and you don't need the TV to tilt, this mount would be perfect for you. I may not have been able to use it but I'm saving it for the next TV I need to mount in the future.",

Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to mount a tv on a wall.FYI...My wife came home from work after I installed it and she wanted the tv an inch lower.I was about to get a divorce then I realized all I had to do was to change which hight bolt on the back of the tv.It slides left and right by inches so you have some margin of error and you can adjust the hight by moving the brackets on the back of the tv. So if you mount it and you want it higher or lower there is some give.Put the bolts in the middle of the tv so you can give your self an out if you want to go higher or lower.",

The anchors that come with it are no good. The screws did not grip them at all!!. This cheap little thing is to small to reach across studs. Please find something else if you need it for anything over 32 inches. You get what you pay for.",

The anchors they include with this is trash but the unit itself is great.",

It is made of a durable metal and have 100 % confidence in it holding my 32\" TV, as long as it's drilled to a stud. The only downside is that you can only slide the TV brackets so far sideways to center it in the room. But the price greatly makes up for that, so 5 stars!!!",
