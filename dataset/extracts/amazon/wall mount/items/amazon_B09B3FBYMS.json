The monitor arm is a little shorter than I expected -- although that's really on me because I didn't look at the measurements... I'm just saying that you should measure to make sure that it will work for your specific application. Otherwise, the mount and arm are very sturdy. Enough hardware is provided for multiple different installation applications, and the instructions are very good and clear.",
