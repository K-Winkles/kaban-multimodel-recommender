                "reviewText": "Used on 85\" QN85B. Low profile looks great.TL;DR: You may have to purchase washers. Put power/cable port below mount. A little more work up front, but do it one time and it's worth the look.The company must have addressed previous complaints about bolt lengths. I received 9 different TV bolt mount options with length/width varieties. But, for the largest width bolts, the washers did not fit, and that's what I needed (widest & shortest). I was able to repurpose the washers received for the wall mount bolts, to use with the wide TV mount bolts. I have metal studs so I had to purchase toggle mounts anyway and didn't use the wood/drywall mounting bolts that came with the kit.Better to put outlet/cable port below the wall mount. But this kit still worked with power/cable port in the middle of the wall mount by running cables into the sides of the wall mount.The unlock cords were too short for 85\". I added zip ties onto the bottom so I could still reach them. There is Velcro on the cords, and they can be shortened, but it would have been nice if there were Velcro hook patches on the beginning and end of the straps so it could also be lengthened.With the way I ran cables, it was a little hard to know if bottom locked in, until I got some experience with it. So don't pull to hard on the bottom of the TV if you have a big TV.Even with the bottom release straps, it would not be convenient to constantly add/remove cables. Also, my TV has input ports sideways with a recessed hole which helps.",

                "reviewText": "Don\u2019t normally write reviews on items, but since this one didn\u2019t have one at the time of buying I figured I\u2019d leave one. I gave it a shot since it was the only one I found that was the closest to being as flush as the Frame TV mount was going to be.Overall, turned out perfect. No issues to report. Nothing is bending after checking it after a week. Seems solid! Going to be getting more for other rooms. Our 65in Frame TV has been hanging up for almost 2 months now and still no issues.",
