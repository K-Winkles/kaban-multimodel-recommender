                "reviewText": "I recently decided to mount my 65\" TV in my bedroom and chose this ultra-slim tilt TV wall mount for the job. It's been a great addition to my space, combining functionality with a sleek design.The first thing I noticed about this mount is its low profile. Once installed, there's only a 0.8\" gap between the TV and the wall, which gives it a clean, almost seamless look. This design is perfect for anyone who appreciates a minimalist aesthetic or simply wants to save space.The installation process was more straightforward than I expected. Although you'll need your own tools, the mount comes with all the necessary hardware and a clear set of instructions. The inclusion of a bubble level in the kit was a thoughtful touch, ensuring that I got the TV perfectly level on the first try.The mount's compatibility with a range of TV sizes and VESA patterns is a big plus. It's reassuring to know that it can securely hold TVs up to 80 inches and 99 lbs. The quick release and lock feature is another highlight. It\u2019s designed to easily attach and detach the TV from the mount, a convenient feature for when you need to access ports on the back of the TV.As for the tilt function, it provides just enough adjustability for an optimal viewing angle, especially useful in a bedroom setting where you might be viewing from different positions.In summary, this TV wall mount is a solid choice for anyone looking to mount their TV with a sleek, space-saving design. It's sturdy, easy to install, and provides a great viewing experience. Definitely a worthwhile investment for a more streamlined and modern look in any room.",

                "reviewText": "This ELIVED TV mount allows for a nice flush mount to your wall for 26 - 80 inch TVs. The mounting uses the standard VESA patterns range from 4\u201dx4\u201d to 24\u201dx16\u201d and holds up to 99 lbs. This mount should work for any TV that fits those size requirements - we had no issues with it mounting to our Samsung TV. We especially like the fact that this mount keeps the TV extremely close to the wall, however still allowing for some tilt adjustment. If you are wanting more tilt, mount the bracket lower on the holes so when tilted the bottom of the TV does not hit the wall as soon. The bracket is well made, with many different hole options to fit your mounting application. Directs are adequate for a first-timer to understand.This is a nice mount that gives a very flush wall mount.",
