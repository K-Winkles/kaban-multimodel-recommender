Please note, the hooks must be facing down once installed. Before step 2, please grab a buddy to help. Attach TV to Mount Hang the VESA brackets with TV onto the mount, making sure all 4 hooks are engaged with the horizontal bars. Flip the security bracket on each VESA bracket up, and insert the thumbscrews to secure. Route Cables Tame the messy cables by routing cords through the cable clip on the arm. This gives your TV mount an organized appearance and keeps cords out of the way when you\u2019re adjusting screen angles. Screen Positioning Level the TV by slightly loosening the four nuts in the back, and tighten them again after leveling the screen. To adjust the TV tilt, slightly loosen the knob and two side bolts, find the perfect angle, and re-tighten.",

I can stow the tv flush into the shelf or bring it out into the room and turn and tilt so everyone can see the screen. Mounted to the wall very securely (designed to support a much larger tv). Comes with long screws for mounting into wall studs, but I added a few large drywall anchors for good measure. Very happy with this choice.",

I had a friend install it who has a studfinder and he was done on about 30 minutes.It is sturdy and glides easy. I have had to get behind it to get to my router and maneuvering it was easy. I highly recommend this if you need this type of reach.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mount due to past excellent past experiences with Vivo products. I am very disappointed in this mount. The lower and upper tilt adjustment screws no longer tighten anything. I only noticed this when changing from a 55\" to a 75\" which weighs around 90 lbs. It kept tilting forward and I would keep trying to tighten the tilt adjustments and they just wouldn't tighten. Also, I had the mount nice and level prior to hanging the TV but the arm bends down so much that level was way off. Trying to get this thing level with the tilt not stable and seeing how much it was bending the arm had me all sort of paranoid. Not the level of confidence I want in holding my TV. Will be replacing with another brand mount and will have me reconsidering buying any Vivo products in the future.",
