                "reviewText": "My son was getting a tv for his bday and his room is small so we knew we'd want to get a wall mount. I browsed several styles and read reviews and felt this would be a good one. He got a 32 inch Samsung, it's extremely light weight tv, in fact the bracket weighs more than the tv. I was tempted to not put the bracket on a stud (mostly because the stud wasn't exactly where we wanted to put the tv) but we decided to follow the directions and put it in a stud just to be sure. It's not too far off from where we wanted it, with a little maneuvering of the mount we can position it where we want pretty much. It was pretty darn easy to get together and install UNTIL it was time to mount the tv to the bracket, the screws given were pathetically short and didn't get the job done (that's what she said lol) anyways, my husband had to go to the local hardware store and came back with 3 different sizes just to be sure. One of those sizes worked perfectly and after that it was a breeze. If it wasn't for the setback of having to go get different size screws I'd say the entire install would've taken 20 minutes at the most. It's pretty hard to maneuver the arm to get it to come out of the wall further, but the movement of tilting the screen or turning it is very easy to do. We hung it up kind of high on the wall, mostly so the kids don't try to mess with it, and we were able to tilt it down enough so the kids can see it clearly. Now my husband and I want the same setup in our room, and when we do I will definitely order this bracket again.updated 6/9/20: we purchased a second one for a 32 inch in the master bedroom. very happy with these products.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice bracket. Installation was easy and instructions were good. I had two minor issues with it:1) The bottom bolt that goes in the wall is tricky to turn since its very close to the hinge screw and there is not enough space to fit a socket head on it, so its manual wrench time. Would be nice to increase spacing by a simple 1/8th of an inch to allow a socket head to go on and turn the bolt faster.2) I had to send my son to the hardware store to get 30 mm bolts to fit the 32\" Samsung. They do not come with the bracket. TVs are changing in construction very fast so be aware of the need to get more bolts if the threads on your TV are deep.Finally, with TVs being so light these days, I wonder if bracket vendors will lighten up also. This bracket almost weighed as much as the TV.",

                "reviewText": "Unbelievably wonderful, and easy for me, a person with limited physical abilities, to install. First, I am using this with a Samsung 32\" Smart TV, and yes I needed to buy separate screws for the TV (M8x20 to use without Samsung's spacers, M8x30 with the spacers). The M8 is the size and the 20 or 30 is the length. VideoSecu did package it with a variety of screws all seem short, about 12mm length.So, using a stud finder, I marked off the stud where it was to be located. Then sketching the holes of the base, I drilled the pilot holes according to the easy to follow, for the most part, directions. Then it was a matter of simply screwing the base to the stud.I then added the four \"legs\" to the plate to make it fit 200x200 holes already on the TV. The M8x20 screws from ACE did the do and then the plate was securely attached to the TV.Now what makes this armature stick out from the rest of the pack....The plate has little \"teeth\" that make it very, very easy to put the TV onto the armature, balanced, making it easy for one person to then attach the armature and plate already secured to the TV.In use, the movable joints are nice and tight, so that the TV stays where you put it, including horizontally level. My TV needs to be adjusted between 3 positions for viewing: bed, chair, bathroom. After much use everything is still tight enough to hold the various positions. Much unlike many other reviews for other wall mounts describe.I still can't believe, nor can anyone else, that I was able to do this by myself!",
