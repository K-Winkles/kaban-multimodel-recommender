                "reviewText": "Mount came very quickly and included a lot of parts for use with different TVs. You will have a lot of extra parts so don't worry. Instructions were a bit wordy, but overall, they are good. I used the mount with a 10-year-old flat screen TV that was a bit heavier than newer flat screen TVs. Hardest part was finding the studs. After that, the 4 lag bolts supplied are sturdy and went deep into the studs. I strongly recommend you first drill the studs as show. The lag bolts seem to have an odd hex head size, but I eventually found the correct ratch socket. Once the wall plate is up, the TV is easy to install and having someone help you center on the wall mount is helpful. Mounting seems sturdy. I would recommend hooking up any cables or attachments before you connect the TV to the wall mount; however, taking it off is relatively easy.",
