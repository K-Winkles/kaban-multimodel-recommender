I needed about 18\u201d of extension to accomplish this, and I was hesitant as I didn\u2019t feel a 65\u201d TV could be extended that far without considerable sag.This mount is rock solid. Very easy to mount to studs in your wall. I like how the TV easily hooks onto the mount, and that you can secure the screen with a bottom screw on each side.The screen can easily be adjusted left and right, either by sliding in the mount, or simply by the nature of how the hinge mechanism works. It\u2019s simple to extend and move the screen once mounted, and it holds its position very well.I\u2019m glad I went this route.",

I got it on a sale for $89 and I have to say it was money well spent. Hung a 77\u201d Samsung S89C with this and I wanted to make sure I bought a mount I could trust. Mount is very well built with no pre assembly to the mount itself. Templates provided and instructions were easy to follow. Only minor complaint is the included hardware didn\u2019t have the M8 x 30 mm length I needed for this TV. The included hardware had a gap of 25mm to 35mm which both were too short or too long. I had to run to the hardware store to get the 30mm length I needed. Maybe this is just a thing with these new Samsung TVs but wanted to point that out. Overall I would highly recommend this mount.",

To set it on the mount. It says it weighed 99.9 lbs. Out-of-the-box. Very important. To find center on your mount and your television and do the math from ceiling. To what you're hanging it over? I lost 9 inches because of a beam. I had a new fireplace mantle and a new TV. And I had to trust all the manufacturer measurements. But when I went to hang it, I gave myself a couple extra inches off the ceiling and I'm glad I did. Because you don't think about it. But the TV doesn't go straight. On to the mount. When you have no clearance, I had to tip it. Hook it and then let it set on the bar. But as you can see, it worked out well. I would definitely use this product again. I just don't know if I ever own another television this large again. I was mounting this into a brick wall. So I definitely did not want to have to keep redrilling holes because I was off by an inch. I wished I could have found a wooden stud. But no such thing in a brick wall. Lead anchors and lag bolts. So what I used? I would not recommend using. Permanent hammer in anchors. Because you don't know if your math is right. Good luck.",
