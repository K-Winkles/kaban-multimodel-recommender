The tilt is a bit of a disappointment very hard to adjust. still working with that. but over all a great investment for the money. Even though tilt Challenged, a great investment for me. I am using it to hold up an old school monitor flat screen 24 inch that's pretty heavy no problems yet. So far so good. Monitor tilt left and right will hang very slight to the left or the depending on movement or sway. hardly noticeable but if you tighten it up not to be tilted before installed problem will correct. you just won't be able to tilt fore-ward or backward. A small price to pay for the most reasonable deal. Other wise fabricate your own tool to get in between the back of your monitor and tilt plate, Good luck lol. My solution is like a picture frame hanging a little to the left or right depending movement I will just deal with it. almost forgot you don't need them but plugs that insert into bracket are pretty loose and fall out easily no biggie a little crazy glue will seal them tight. Over all I am satisfied and grateful.",

IT even included the screws!I have bought mounts that are 50-200 dollars that were not that easy to install and did not come with screws.The mount even has some swivel to it. and maybe could use a little tightening but seriously, It is all pretty much done with drywall anchors too.I was kind of swayed by some of the reviews, It is obvious now that it had to be someone that should not install a mount or is a competitor upset that their 50 dollar mount was being sold cheaper and wanted to mess with this company.I am glad I took the chance, Seriously I hate reviews sometimes but had to put to this up there so people realized it was that easy. I had it out of the box and on my wall in less than 15 minutes with a stud finder.",

                "reviewText": "Can't really complain for the price. It seems to be a sturdy wall mount so far, but the bolts and mounting screws are worthless. One of the mounting screws didn't even have the screw head, it was just flat, and the bolts to mount it to the wall look cheap and aren't that long.The worst part however is the fact that the mounting plate is not removable. That means the you have to hold the TV up to the mounting plate while the mount is on the wall. I barely managed to do this by myself even with the tiny 22\" Vizio I was mounting.Pro tip if you need to use spacers: tape them in place to the mounting plate! Otherwise you will be forced to invent new curse words after the old ones have all been uttered a million times for each time you drop one of the tiny plastic spacers and watch it bounce away.",
