Originally I had the TV on a swing arm that cost about 3 times as much from a national chain store. It flopped about like a sheet in the wind.Although this is more complex and heavy it is rock solid. It holds its position and and doesn't move unlike the stupid arm. I like the way the TV can be drawn forward and then stowed by pushing backwards. This also helps the tilt and ability to turn to the (in my case) right.This was a perfect solution to a difficult problem. I thoroughly recommend and would buy again in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewText": "We added a TV to our \"family cave\" this weekend and I ordered this to hang up our new LG 65\" QNED TV. I must say I was quite impressed with the sturdiness of it and it came with an easy-to-use template. The only assembly needed was 4 screws (came with plenty of sizes to choose from) to secure the brackets to the TV, and 4 mounting screws to secure it to the wall. Just make sure your studs are on 16\" centers or you'll need to open the wall to add a 2x12 mounting plate. (Most houses have studs on 16\" centers but some may not). I used the included template to pencil out my screw holes and made sure it was level, then used the provided lag bolts to screw it into the studs. After hanging the TV on the bracket (a breeze with 2 people), I tightened the screws on the back to secure it in place.I would recommend adjusting the \"tilt\" prior to installing the TV, the screws for that may be hard to get to once the TV is installed. I guessed at the angle on mine and it turned out to be perfect.The TV can be easily pulled out from the wall and move side-to-side and it feels quite sturdy. Definitely would recommend if you are looking for a compact bracket for a larger TV screen.",
