                "reviewText": "I ordered this mount for our new Samsung Q70R 65\" TV as this is exactly what I was wanting.The mount is very well designed and has a finished look, smooth rounded edges just makes it clean looking when installed. The other mounts that have the rectangular mounting plates are unappealing especially when it's hanging in the living room and very noticeable.This mount is made for either mason or stud wall installation on 16\" centers with a little room to maneuver. Once installed, the full motion arm assembly can be adjusted to the left or right to center on the wall and is very easy to adjust. Installation could not have been easier especially when using the provided install template (less than 20 minutes)! The only snag I ran into was the spacers for the mounting brackets on the TV. The included hardware was great but the bolts were a little too long and the large spacers were to big so I used the spacers that came with the TV and the small spacers that came with the mount. In order to shim it out enough to where the bolts did not bottom out on the panel I added 1 2mm nylon space for each bolt and it was the perfect spacing. The actual mount is an elongated \"H\" that allowed me to install a 2 gang power bridge in the open area of the mount without it interfering with the arm when placed flush to the wall. The kit I used was the Arlington TVBR2505K Flat Panel TV Cable Organizer 2-Gang Kit with Recessed Power Solution purchased on Amazon as well.All said and done this is a great mount, well designed and handles the weight of the TV as it should without and sagging and the movement is very smooth and easy to adjust. I'm glad I found these guys, overall 100% satisfied!The pictures show the mount and TV with the power bridge...don't be at ke down on the cabling as I am not done yet, I am waiting on a delivery from Amazon today that has 4-4' Echogear 2.1 HDMI cables and 1-15' Echogear 2.1 HDMI cable to finish out the installation!",

                "reviewText": "This is a solid mount that holds our 65 inch TV very well. The mounting bracket for the wall has some nice covers to hide the screw heads, and the process to place the TV on the mount makes it fairly easy to do, although you still will need a helper. The mount has a bunch of moving pieces that make it a little crowded for cables when you push it back close to the wall, so take that into consideration when running your cables. The included cable clips are useless, so find some velcro cable straps or similar. It comes with a bunch of screw sizes for the TV, but not the best length for what I needed, so I picked those up at the hardware store. The only real issue with installation was that the locking straps to hold the TV upright brackets to the mount required some bending to fit properly around the horizontal pieces of the mount. It looks like they aren't bent exactly right from the factory. My only other wish is that the leveling adjustment could have some kind of fine adjustment screw as it's hard to get exactly right the first time. Otherwise, the TV comes out easily from the wall to work with connections, and it swivels well if you want to view from another sitting area.",
