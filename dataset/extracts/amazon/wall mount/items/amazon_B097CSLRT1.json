                "reviewText": "First, I like the bracket and the kit, well made, works nicely, but it has minor issues, read on. I mounted on this bracket a 55\" TV with 400x400 mounting pattern. Ok, if you mount the bracket flush to the back of a TV this size, and the bracket flush against the wall, then you will not be able to tilt to the maximum allowable by the bracket, because the bottom of the TV will hit the wall first. If you want full tilt with a TV this size, you need to either space the bracket from the wall, or space the TV from the bracket. The kit has a variety of spacers so you may be able to make it work. I chose to space the bracket from the wall using a 1x4 pine board, but I also had to do this because of stud spacing. So this bracket is smaller than some of the pics let on. If you use the 400x400 mounting pattern, then you have maybe one inch of side to side adjustment remaining on the wall bracket because the wall bracket is only slightly wider than 16 inches. This means that, if you want to span a pair of studs, you are stuck mounting the TV where the studs are, which may not match where you actually want the TV. The only solution is to mount a board on the wall, directly to the studs, that is wider than the stud spacing, so you can then mount the bracket in your desired location. Of course you could attempt to mount the bracket directly to drywall, but I was not willing to risk my TV with that. Again, using this pine board also spaced the TV far enough from the wall that I could achieve full tilt.",

                "reviewText": "Used this on a wall with 16\" studs. It's ability to slide left or right allowed me to position the TV exactly where I wanted it. Plenty of room in the bracket for a double low voltage box on one side and an electric outlet on the other. Note that my electric outlet is NOT recessed, and I have a wall wart plug that keeps the TV from sitting fully back to the wall, but for my use, this is not an issue. Without that wall plug, the TV would be a little closer to the wall.The included cardboard template was also helpful in planning where to position the mount so that my TV would be at the correct height.The ability to pull the TV away from the wall and easily rotate it to the side allows viewing from an area to the side of my main viewing area.I have no concerns of the TV falling, as the mount is very stable when moving.I would purchase again in a heartbeat.",

This mounting rack is so versatile- it works for 16\u201d and 24\u201d center studs, the TV can be adjusted to the side, if the studs are not centered, and it\u2019s heavy-duty enough to practically swing from it. It comes with a great selection of hardware and it\u2019s own mini-level, which we needed with the new TV. And it has a 10 year warranty!! It pulls out, tilts up, down, and to the side. We totally love it, and highly recommend it!",
