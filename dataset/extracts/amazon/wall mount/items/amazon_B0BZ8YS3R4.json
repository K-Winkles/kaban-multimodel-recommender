                "reviewText": "Love the quality of this little mount. it is JUST RIGHT for my small TV (like 14\") in my camper. Like others have said though, it would be nearly impossible to get your hand in the little space afforded by the mount in order to get the little screw in to secure the mount at an angle suitable for watching the TV. With a SMALL TV and a LONG screwdriver it is doable. I may modify it ( by making a slot on top instead of an oval hole) so that the TV can be mounted at the bottom, then swung upward, then tighten the top screws. That way I can leave the top screws in place. not a perfect solution bat at least I am not trying to squeeze screws in with VERY little room for your hand. Will still need a long screwdriver, but this will make it much easier to mount. I do not want to leave the TV attached to the wall while going down the road due to vibration and potholes. Still, I think it is a good value and well-made.",

It's really hard to fit your hand behind it to screw in the final screws. I am a petite woman and my hands were not small enough to maneuver the four screws on to the back of the tv. I think you almost need small child size hands to do it. To be honest it makes me a little nervous knowing those screws aren't as tight as I'd like them being that this is over the tub but there was absolutely no way to get my hand back there to tighten them the way they needed to be tightened. Also, it tilts. It won't stay up against the wall on it's own at all. I had to put a block of wood behind the tv to keep it from tilting.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a good basic tilting TV wall mount. It is very small and compact and should be able to hold up small tv/monitors than are less than 19\" . The wall mount does allow for the standard up/down tilt. I found that this mount was easy to install, but it did not include any installation manual or sheet. I found myself unscrewing/unbolting the wall mount unnecessary because of the lack of instructions.From my experience, I recommend you install the wall mount first to your wall. Then install the bracket to your monitor/tv. The last step should be mounting/connecting the bracket to the wall mount. This WILL be challenging if you don't have much space between the tv and wall. For that reason, I took away a star and would not recommend this particular wall mount setup for anyone that is mounting a tv/monitor more than 19\". It isn't design for anything bigger than that. You will need another person to help you on this installation.Overall, if I had the opportunity to purchase this tv mount again, I would spend a little bit more money and get a mount that allowed more wiggle room between the tv and wall.Thank you for reading this review, I hope you found it helpful.",
