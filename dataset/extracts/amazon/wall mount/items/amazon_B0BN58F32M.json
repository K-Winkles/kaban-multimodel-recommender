There wasn\u2019t really a good surface to put it on and not really a good wall space for it either. So I picked this mount because it had a long enough arm to allow the TV to stick out perpendicular to the wall at the foot of his bed. This mount worked exactly as we wanted. It\u2019s heavier duty than I expected for the price (it\u2019s heavy, make sure you get the bolts into a stud!). It also has the ability to adjust the levelness of the TV once installed, and the ability to tilt it so you have the right viewing angle. This mount also makes it so he could actually watch the TV from anywhere in his room. Highly recommend this mount if you need your TV to not sit flat against the wall.",

It came with all the parts and then some. Works like a dream and was easy for me (36f) to install my husbands 55\u201d tv by myself. I recommend it highly for the price but the quality was good too.",
