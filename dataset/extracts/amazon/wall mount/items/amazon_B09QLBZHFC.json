                "reviewText": "this is a great, simplistic design that works well for xfinity flex as well as streaming boxes. the installation is simple enough that almost anyone can do it. as long as your device is thinner than the 1.8 inches your good. unfortunately the mini pc i wanted to use with this was a little to thick so i used it with the android box in my daughters room instead. the box seems to be held securely so I'm not worried about it falling.",
