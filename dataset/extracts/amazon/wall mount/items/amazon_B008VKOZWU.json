Machined to tight enough tolerances that it would take alot to un-mount the TV but the TV is also held in place by 2 thumb screws just like the screws that hold side panels on most computers = easy to tighten & remove w/o stubby screw driver. The Swivel/tilt is best done w/ TV NOT in wall bracket (clearance issues). I am running coax cable directly into the TV but I have a 90 deg coupling so there is no strain on the TV. Remember, you wanted a low profile mount! I would use a 90 deg HDMI if I ever need to run HDMI. Machined well & moves smoothly. Complete w/ all the screws you need altho I would use Mollies instead of the regular drywall anchors. Surprised that something from China is made well.",
