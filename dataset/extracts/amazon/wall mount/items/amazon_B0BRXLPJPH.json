As soon as we measured for the right height, pre-drilled the pilot holes it was installed in a couple of minutes. For my tv I did not have to use the extensions for the plate that connects my tv with the wall mount. My tv sits pretty flat against the wall but I can pull it out and angle it to the side and I can watch while I cook or clean up. I like it.",

                "reviewText": "This TV Wall Mount is much better than my neighbors much more expensive mounts. I went over to several of my neighbors to inspect their 65\" and 75\" TV mounts. If you try and move their TV's the mounts are too tight and feel like the mount or the TV's are going to fail. This Pipishell Full Motion comes with everything you need for install and once installed the tension is perfect to move or keep it in place. This thing feels strong enough to handle the task with ease. My 95 lb. grandson did several chin ups with the unit extended out with no problems. I am very pleased with the Pipishell.",
