Everything is sturdy, well designed and strong but is too short for my TV. Amazon sent me a return label. I dropped it off at CVS and when I got home Amazon had already credited my account.

                "reviewText": "This TV mount is unique because the part that attaches to your wall is quite narrow. In my situation, this narrow mount allowed us to place the TV on a wall where the electrical outlet for the TV was blocked by a traditional sized TV mount. That allowed us to make use of the convenient plug and get rid of an unsightly extension cord.This narrow mount allows you to have the TV very close to the wall instead of it being pushed out several inches. It makes a big difference in a small room.I especially like that the MOUNTUP Ultra Slim TV Wall Mount has spring-loaded locks to hold the TV on. Other mounts I have used expect you to tighten a screw to do this, when you can barely fit a screwdriver behind it once the TV is on it.As another reviewer has mentioned, you should only install TV mounts into wooden studs. I don\u2019t even trust drywall anchors for framed pictures, so a TV is much too heavy! Since this particular mount has long horizontal slots for the mounting screws, you should be able to find screw positions that hit studs.This is a well-designed TV mount at a good price. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this from Vine for a honest review. Needed a slim tv mount for a small space and it works great.The MOUNTUP Ultra Slim TV Wall Mount comes with all the hardware you could possibly need to install your tv to your wall. A buncha of Vesa screws of various lengths. Washers. Spacers. A allen key with a screwdriver end. Some cable management velcro and 2 big fat threaded screws to keep it nice and sturdy in the wall.The part that attaches to the wall consists of 3 pieces. Two side arms and a middle bracket that attaches the two. This seems to be the weak point of the product. I would have prefered just a single bar but it does the job.There is two strings with magnetic handles on the arms. You pull these down to loosen each pin . Slide the TV on the bar so the top teeth catch it and fit into the designated groove. Pull the pin down so the bottom of the arms slide onto the bar, Then let the string go and the pin pops into place. locking the tv brackets to the bar on the wall. From here you can slide the tv left to right for adjustments.The Tv mount is able to tilt forward and back. For easy viewing. The mount does not tilt left to right though. So for this reason you must make sure your bar is level when attaching it to your wall. Because if it is not. You will be stuck with a crooked looking tv. They do include a mini level in the box but I would recommend using a real level. A long one with a accurate bubble. Making strategic marks on the wall and aligning the wall bracket to these marks.I used this to hang my older 50 inch Roku tv to my Studio wall. It went smooth. I had no problems. I would totally recommend it. TV is quite a bit closer to the wall then my last mount. I think it would be great for a business, bedroom, living room or anyone strapped for space. Thanks for reading and thanks for the mount!",

I wanted a TV mount that does not stick out from the wall too much as I have limited space and do not want any possibility of bumping into the TV and to lessen the chance any equipment will get caught on it if it stick out too far.I have installed a few TV mounts, the base on this one is straightforward to install. I highly recommend you install it too studs and not to drywall using anchors, this is for safety reasons, especially if you have young kids in your household. So the install is fairly simple.The main benefit of this mount is it keeps the TV as close to the wall as possible, while still giving you the ability to connect the power, audio and hdmi cords.Overall, the quality is good, it\u2019s a solid mount and I have not worries it will break or fail.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this TV wall mount for my 55\u201d TV in the bedroom. It was very easy to install and came with everything I needed for installation. Just bolt the wall mount to the wall and bolt the two TV mounts to the TV. I included pictures of both.It has a simple design. The wall mount comes in two pieces that join in the middle with a connector that joins the two pieces together with 4 provided screws. I included a picture of the wall mount installed on the wall. Only two lag bolts are required to mount the wall mount.Other nice features about this TV mount are you do not require any tools to secure the TV Mounts to the wall mount as there are two spring loaded clips attached to a lanyard that you just pull to release when you need to mount the TV or to remove. At the end of the lanyards are magnetic pieces that will hold to the TV wall mount to hide them out of sight after installation.This TV wall mount also can angle or tilt down to 12 degrees. I do not require any tilting so keeping the TV flush with the wall works great for my 55\u201d TV.Although this TV mount comes in a small box and only looks like a few small pieces of metal, its design holds up to 99 lbs. My 55\u201d TV is under 30 lbs. It is a breeze to install and everything you need in the package including a little level for installing the wall mount. There is nothing negative to comment on. It\u2019s a great design and easy to install.",
