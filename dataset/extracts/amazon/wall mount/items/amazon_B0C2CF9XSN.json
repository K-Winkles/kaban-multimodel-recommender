                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded to a 75\" TV and, being far from a handyman, the prospect of installing a wall mount filled me with dread. However, the KAMIWI Stud Free TV Stand proved to be an absolute game-changer, making the installation process a breeze for someone like me who's not very skilled with tools.This is my second time purchasing this mount; the first was for a 55\" TV, and the simplicity of the installation process was what drew me back. The \"drill-free\" and \"stud-free\" features are no exaggeration \u2013 it truly lives up to its promises. The step-by-step instructions were easy to follow, and the entire setup took me a fraction of the time it usually takes for traditional, bulkier mounts.Beyond the ease of installation, the mount holds up impressively well. It feels sturdy and secure, providing the peace of mind that my sizable TV is safely mounted. The sleek design is a welcome departure from the older, bulkier mounts that I've dealt with in the past, adding a touch of modernity to my entertainment setup.If you're like me, not particularly skilled with tools, but in need of a reliable and straightforward TV mount, the KAMIWI Stud Free TV Stand is the way to go. It's not just easy to install \u2013 it's strong, reliable, and a significant upgrade from the older, bulkier options. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I was about to purchase a few boards of wood and some bolts to DIY a french cleat to attach our old TV to the wall.When I saw the low cost of a metal based alternative, with less work, I was sold.We have an old 42\" Samsung that needed to be placed on the wall and this kit fit the bill.We have an older house and I read that older drywall may not hold as sturdy as newer material, so it was fortuitous that the area I needed to place the mounting bar was along a stud.The area where the nails are to be hammered could be a bit longer, as I was pounding the bar and would occasionally hit the edge of the bar with the hammer.Overall, it does the job of holding up the TV to the wall.The spacers were not wide enough and I did not know how to use the cone shaped spacers, I ended up using some pick and pluck style foam to angle the TV a bit forward along the bottom, so I could plug in the HDMI and power cables.",
