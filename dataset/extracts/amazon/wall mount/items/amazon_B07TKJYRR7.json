                "reviewText": "Definitely worth the price as it was a little more than other mounts but the features were alot better. Really easy to get this mounted. Took less than an hour with 2 people. Use an impact driver and drill along with a level that it actually comes with a small one with a magnet and installation will be a breeze. Great quality and really sturdy. Would buy this again in the future for my other kid.",

Oh well. The mount is great though. Also as a sidenote, screws are used to secure the bottom of the TV to the mount as opposed to the clips. That the only real difference I've noticed to my other 2 mounts. I prefer the clips, but that's probably just personal preference.",
