We wall mounted our 65\u201d curve television and also mounted the matching curve sound bar underneath, so it was important the wall mount was well constructed but most importantly large enough to reach both wall studs. This mount allowed for expanding with additional hardware included for wider reach. The power bar built in helped with additional electrical needs since our tv was a little older requiring some extra outlets to finish a clean wire free look when completed.",
