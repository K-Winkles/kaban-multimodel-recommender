Since bracket mounts to studs, there is really no way to center it on the wall as you cannot slide it left or right. My biggest complaint is the screws on the bottom for tightening the TV to the bracket. I have a Phillips over a foot long and it isn't long enough to reach under the bottom of the TV. I will need to buy a longer screwdriver to make this work. In hindsight, I should have bought a bigger bracket with the locking bar you slide in from the side.",

The unit comes in a small box but the product is well made and comes with everything that you need.I knew exactly what I was looking for, small enough to hide, thin enough to be \"almost\" flushed to the wall.This little unit is a great item to get to hang up your TV. Make sure you get the right TV Mount for the size of your TV. This one came with everything you need. Remember, if you need it to tilt, move away from the wall or to view from an different angle, then this is not what you are looking for.If you want a simple, thin TV Mount at a great price, then look no further. Definitely recommend this product.",

The mount itself isn't as beefy as other mounts I've used in the past but holds a 55inch no problem. The safety screw needs a long extension for a drill bit or an unnaturally long screwdriver to tighten. There is a picture review that shows 10inches but that will be different for different TVs",

                "reviewText": "Well at $20 CAD how could I resist. A few things you should know before buying this. If your TV only has HDMI inputs coming outward from the back you will need a special 90 degree HDMI cord because your TV will be too close to the wall for a regular cord that sticks out when plugged in.Also you definitely want to find the studs in your wall which must be no farther than 16 inches apart from each other. You will need a drill with a 4.5mm (3/16 in) drill bit. Do not try screwing it into just drywall, your TV will fall out and break.The worst part about this mount is the screws provided to screw into the wall. Even though they are hefty they are made of a soft metal and strip very easily. They have a hexagon head that is a funny size. Neither my 3/8 in or 7/16 in hex drill bit fit on the screw tightly. I had to dig out my automobile socket wrench set for the Number 10 socket which fit perfectly. Seriously don't try to install this without the No. 10 socket. Even though there are Philips head slots, there's no way you can screw them into the wall tightly, as the screws strip very easily.The last annoying part is two screws you must tighten to secure the brackets attached to the TV to the bracket attached to the wall. But since the screws are less than an inch from the wall it's near impossible to tighten them without a foot long or more screwdriver.That said, once it was all installed it seems pretty secure and it's nice to have my TV on the wall to save space and have it exactly the level I want it. Lucky I had all the tools needed but you might get frustrated if you have a limited selection of tools. Mainly that No. 10 socket. Cheers and good luck.",
