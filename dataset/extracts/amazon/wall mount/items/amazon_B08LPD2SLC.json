It doesn't have any ergonomics or angles to adjust, it is literally just a plate that goes on the wall and your monitor/TV will sit completely flush against it. You won't have space to connect any cables out the back so be aware. Cheap, easy, quick solution.",

                "reviewText": "I searched between a bunch of similar products in a similar price range and picked this one because it appeared, in the product photos at least, to be slightly better made. Unfortunately what I received looked identical to a couple other slightly cheaper priced items which had bad reviews due to the \u201csturdiness\u201d of the metal\u2026 and with that said, was not exactly as the product photos pictured on this item.Regardless, it worked for its intended purpose of holding up a rather heavy 23\u201d old Apple display monitor. It wobbles if you try to tilt the monitor side to side, for \u201csturdiness\u201d testing, but it\u2019s secure and I can\u2019t imagine any situation where it will break or the monitor would fall off. I believe it was marketed towards use in RV\u2019s.. and I probably wouldn\u2019t advise of it being used for that purpose simply due to the amount it wobbles while holstered. If that doesn\u2019t matter to you, then it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. What do you expect for around $10",
