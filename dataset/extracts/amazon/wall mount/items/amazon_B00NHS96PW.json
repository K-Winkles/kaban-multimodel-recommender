                "reviewText": "I had an old 42\" plasma (heavy) TV that I decided to move from the bedroom to a guest room. The only place it would work was above the patio doors, and there was only enough clearance to keep it above the door frame if it had a lot of tilt (also needed because it was high up). This bracket was highly adjustable and had about 20 degrees of tilt, whereas most have 8-12. It took a great deal of measuring to determine just the right height to install the wall bracket, but I got it right the first time! NOTE: This is a 9ft ceiling.It took two of us to hang the TV because it was so heavy, but it is very easy to attach to the bracket, and it is very sturdy, and there is quite a bit of left-right adjustment capability. I have nothing but good things to say about this TV bracket. I found the perfect flat power cable to run along the outside of the frame, and I also needed a 1ft IEC power cord to replace the TV's power cord, but it looks great. I used a hot glue gun to attach the white power cord to the frame.If anyone needs to do something like this, I recommend the following cord:Maximm 360 Degree Rotating Flat Extension Cord 10 Ft Multi 3 Outlet Power Cord Grounded 16 AWG UL Certified, White",

                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this mount. The Chinese brands prevalent on Amazon can be hit or miss, but this one turned out better than most of the OEM mounts at 3x the price.- Metal alloy has decent heft, and didn't warp during fastening or TV mounting.- Included hardware was decent, no stripped/broken screws requiring a trip to the hardware store.- Predrilled holes and slots were all properly aligned and sized.- Vertical support options made it easy to mount a 65\" OLED TV, which is lighter than a conventional LED/LCD but also has all of its weight and bulk (and the VESA itself) in the bottom third.- Mounted TV can slide horizontally, and combined with the many available positions for lag bolts, this makes it easy to horizontally center the TV. The only situation where I imagine this being a problem is if your studs are 24\" apart AND start exactly where you want the TV centered. My studs are the standard 16\" so I had no problems.- Packaging was good quality and instructions were clear. Just don't rush and confuse the concrete-wall instructions with the wood-stud instructions.- After 3 months it's still totally stable, no signs of weakening or shifting.I've seen some reviews complaining about the low amount of real-world tilt, or the distance from the wall. Please note that this is a \"slim\" or \"space saving\" mount. The whole point is to get really close to the wall, almost flush; you're sacrificing some accessibility for aesthetics. You generally shouldn't be mounting TVs far above eye level, because it's very hard on your neck and back, but if you absolutely must mount in some unusual area such as above the fireplace, then you want a \"swivel\" or \"full motion\" mount, or a mount customized for that location like the MantelMount, and not this mount or any other \"slim\" mount.It WILL be difficult to access the back panel of your TV after mounting it, and plugging in a new device could require either unmounting or spending a long time fiddling with long-nose pliers and other instruments. So take my advice: buy $20 worth of right-angle adapters (for HDMI, USB, etc.) and convert those back ports into side or bottom ports. Also, connect your cables before mounting the TV, even if you don't plan to use some ports right away; you'll be glad you did when you decide to hook up a new streaming or gaming device in a few months or years. 15 minutes of planning now could save you many hours later.Aside from the caveats above, which apply to any slim or flush mount, I'm very happy with the product.",

                "reviewText": "Needed to mount a 50\" flat screen above a pair of closet doors and since this is a little higher than average I wanted a decent degree of tilting range. I know most people don't mount TV's this high, but our bedroom is unique and it works perfectly for us since we mainly watch it from our bed. I ended up tilting it at least 15 degrees but could've tilted it further if needed. For those reviews that said they didn't get that range of tilting because their TV bottom hits the wall, it is probably caused by two reasons: Not using the spacers when mounting the brackets to the back of the TV and/or mounting the brackets to the back of the TV too high. The holes in the bracket allow you to mount them at various heights. Mount them as low as your VESA spacing will allow in order to get the most tilting range.The mount is sturdy and assembled easy. I like that the brackets give a defined \"click\" when you hang the TV onto the mount and lets you know they're engaged. When lining up the mounting bracket to catch studs, you usually need a small degree of adjustment after hanging the TV so that it's centered where you want it. The length of the wall bracket and the method the TV attaches to the bracket allows for a fair amount of left-right adjustment to get the TV centered perfectly. This of course depends on the size of the TV and your VESA spacing, but a 50\" TV allowed for at least 3-4 inches left or right, when centered. I have to add, and no offense intended, but those that experienced any difficulty with this mount probably should not be installing it themselves. Like most wall-mounts, it includes packs of various sized VESA-mounting screws, spacers and even an assortment of lag screws to fit most installation scenarios. You will need a good ratchet set, cordless drill, various size pilot bits and some other basic tools to mount this properly. If mounting to a wood stud wall, no other hardware is needed. Casual, limited skill DIYers take note....Nothing says \"I did it myself but don't have the additional skills necessary to do it right\" more than an awesome flat screen TV mounted on a wall with the cables and power cord visible and hanging down to the receptacle and tuner. There's more to mounting a TV on the wall than hanging the bracket. To do it right, additional steps should be taken into account (finding studs, running electric, obtaining longer HDMI cables, fishing the wires in the wall, etc.). Proper planning and good execution is important. As far as the mount itself, anyone with experience will have no problems with this mount. Anyone asking what type of screws to use or whether it can be mounted on a brick wall shouldn't be doing this themselves. Like some of my other reviews, I will echo Dirty Harry's sentiment: \"A man's got to know his limitations\".....I would recommend it for applications that need some additional tilting.NOTE: I purchased this item on Amazon for full price and have no affiliation to the seller. I try to write helpful, unbiased and insightful reviews because I also read reviews prior to making my own buying decisions. I notice many reviews lack helpful information, are not well written or give poor reviews based on not reading directions, inexperience or failing to read the product details prior to purchasing. Writing valuable reviews helps pay it forward.",
