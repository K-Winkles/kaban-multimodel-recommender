Package arrived next day as advertised on screen. I opened package and noticed right away this is a good heavy duty bracket. Brakes is made of all metal. It was easy to install once I located the stud. The best part about this bracket is that you can swing it out. My daughter was very happy with her TV mounted on the wall. Over all a great product at great price.",
