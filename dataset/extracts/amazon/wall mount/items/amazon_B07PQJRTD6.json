                "reviewText": "Very pleased for the price and wound up buying two - both for 32\" LCD TV's.Bought the first to wall-mount a TCL 32\" Roku TV in a bedroom. It had a good selection of screws and spacers to attach the TV and some very stout screws to attach the main frame directly to wall studs. The horizontal adjustment range was more than sufficient to get the TV where I wanted it after attaching the base to the wall. The hanging ribbon pulls make it very easy to pop the TV into place, but with a smaller TV they hang down distractingly and one of these days I'll secure them out of sight with a velcro wire tie. Bought the second to mount a similar TV because the first worked out so well and was a great value.",
