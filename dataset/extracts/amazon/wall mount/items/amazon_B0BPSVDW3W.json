I have a new TV and a stand to which I didn\u2019t have the bracket for the back of my TV and therefore I needed an easy fix. This no stud tv wall mount worked perfectly for me. It\u2019s very sturdy, well built and priced economically friendly I highly recommend",

Non ci sono tasselli perch\u00e8 non previsti.INSTALLAZIONE: a differenza di quanto mostrato nelle istruzioni, ho preferito fissarla al muro con 3 fisher da 6mm. Le viti passa giuste giuste nei fori presenti sulla staffa.L'installazione della parte di staffa che si attacca alla tv \u00e8 stata immediata.ASSEMBLAGGIO: una volta montati i due pezzi (uno a muro e uno sulla TV) attaccare la tv alla staffa \u00e8 relativamente semplice...dipende dalle dimensioni della tv.generalmente mi ritengo soddisfatto, avrei preferito qualche cm in meno tra il muro e la tv ma per queste cifre non posso lamentarmi.",
