Part of the problem was the back of my monitor is not flat from top to bottom but the back braces are and they are 17\" long, the same height as my monitor. This made the bottom part of the braces farther away from the back, bottom holes. Luckily, they included 2 lengths of back screws and the longer ones reached far enough. It is secure enough but since the back braces are the same height as my 32\" monitor, you can see them sticking out from the top. I didn't need it to look pretty since this was for an outdoor monitor up on a wall. The wall bracket installed easy enough. It's pretty easy to attach/detach the monitor since it just hangs off the wall bracket. For the price, it will do.",
