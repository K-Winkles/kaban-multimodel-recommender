                "reviewText": "Bought this for the Echo Show 15 after realizing that the flip mount we originally ordered would simply not work. The flip mount would not stow all the way and made the counter unusable when the Echo was stowed. This mount is the ANSWER! It was super easy to install, I used heavy duty wall anchors and nails (from a big box store) instead of using a stud and it works great. To ensure it would stow correctly, rotate, and not hit the upper cabinets I attached the back to the mount first and then marked where the mount would go. I could not be happier with the mount, and it allows me to use my Echo as intended. I would not recommend the flip style mounts at all due to the size of the Echo itself.",

                "reviewText": "It looks sturdy enough, but out of the box was extremely difficult to swivel at all three swivel points. The two swivel points closest to the wall were easy enough to loosen slightly using a wrench. However the third swivel point (the one furthest from the wall mount) did not seem to have anyway to adjust. If I could loosen it just a tad, this thing would probably ok fine. But I can't so I don't want to mount it.Additionally, there appears to be NO WAY to get any customer support. Possibly there is a way to adjust the third swivel point, but there is NO WAY to get any help. Worthless. Hopefully, I can get a refund. Amazon is pretty good about that, I just wish Amazon would screen the companies--if no customer support, then they shouldn't be allowed to sell their products on Amazon.",
