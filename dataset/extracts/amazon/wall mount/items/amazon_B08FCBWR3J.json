                "reviewText": "I really like this mount. It was very simple to install, even came with its own level. My only gripe was that I messed up the phillips slots in one of the bolts because my bit jumped. It wasn't until later my dumb a** realized the bolts may be phillips, but also have standard hex head shape so I could have just put a socket driver on my drill lol. So I'd strong suggest you do that rather than try to drive the bolts into your studs with a phillips attachment.I really like the two pull string release mechanism. The only other wall mount I worked with before had allen bolts that would snug up to hold the TV secure. This is SO much easier to release. I don't like that the cords hang below the level of the TV, but that was remedied with a \"command hook\" mounted center and a coupe inches up from the bottom of the TV. I just pull the cords up and loop them over the hook. Voila, no more visible cord.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good bracket for a TV from 40 to 55\"",
                "reviewText": "The item came disassembled in a box that is about 60% smaller than the assembled bracket. You have to put together the two wings of the bracket by connecting one wing to a flat fitting with the supplied screws. The package comes also with two long clips with pivoted upper hooks that would be screwed to the back of the TV. Installation was straightforward, since the kit includes a mounting template made of card which was a bit flimsy but was nevertheless good help. Mounting the clips to the TV is relatively easy: I removed the temporary screws from mine and chose appropriate screws included in the package, which comes with sets of mounting screws to fit most TVs, plus spacers in case the appropriate screws are too long, or if you need to space the clips and the TV so that the TV itself does not hit the wall.Overall the bracket is doing the job of holding my 55\" flat TV on the wall. I can't verify it would hold a bigger size TV but I don't see why not, provided you mount the bracket to wall studs on both sides with the 4 provided stud bolts. I recommend you drill pilot holes first with a small diameter bit before you drill the bigger holes needed for the bolts with a bigger size bit. You want the hole to be slightly smaller than the threads (but not too small), so that the threads have something to bite but not so small that the wood expands or it is difficult to turn the bolt.",
