If you\u2019re not familiar with mounting things to the wall i\u2019d recommend getting help or having someone do for you. I mounted a 32\u201d led tv to this wall mount. TV is pretty light. 10-15lbs tops but wall mount is very stable fully extended even and safe enough for my kids to move tv around to desired location. The tilt motion for the TV holds great but you may need to adjust the 2 screws to the right tension so the tv doesn\u2019t flop downward. No complaints from me would definitely buy again. Compared to our local best buy it\u2019s well under half the cost for a similar mount.",

The unit is rugged enough however I don't think I'd stress it with anything over a 32 inch tv. The overall articulation movements are smooth and the cost is very reasonable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I felt the directions could have been better. Im happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This wall mount is smaller than others that I have used, but OK for a 26\" TV or smaller. However, the hardware is undersized to the point that it won't hold the TV at the correct angle. There is an adjustment for viewing angle that is locked in place with 2 very small screws. Unfortunately the weight of the TV makes the unit drop down, making the screen pointing way down. No amount of tightening the screws would keep it up at a normal viewing angle, so I had to jam some nuts in the mechanism to make it workable. I do not recommend this wall mount.REVISION: Apparently I ordered a TV arm that was too small for my TV, resulting in problems. With the help of the companies TERRIFIC CUSTOMER SERVICE, I received a larger arm, part number YD1015-A that was exactly what I needed to mount my TV. The new mount is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as it worked perfectly to mount my heavy 26\" TV. I am confident that it would hold a much larger TV, at least up to 43\" or 50\" depending on weight. Plus, it came with all of the hardware needed to mount it, including screws and a level! Just be sure to order the correct size for your application!",

                "reviewText": "I was startled to find the package in one of those white and blue Amazon bubbly envelopes, and even more shocked to find this tiny package inside that is supposed to be my monitor wall mounting bracket. My other wall mounting bracket for our larger TV is huge and weighs a ton so I was surprised to see this little thing, thinking no way is this going to work. Next came the removal of it from the box it was in. It was complete with everything necessary to get the job done, minus a drill and drill bit to secure the lag bolts into the wall. There are 3 different size screw/bolts for different sized holes that most TVs and monitors have in the back for just this purpose. Also, there are several sized rubbery washers/spacers in case the back is somewhat curved or rounded a bit, this will ensure a better tight fit, so that was a bonus. They tossed in a little wrench, cheap, but good for the 1 time use to secure the arms to the attachment part. The instructions are written easily enough so that anyone even remotely skilled in assembly can figure this out. Just look at the pieces for a minute to familiarize yourself, look at the instruction pictures and it should be fairly obvious how it all goes together. Overall, I am very happy with the entire thing from start to finish. It does exactly as it is stated, and the attached videos are good to watch as well, recommended for those who are not so mechanically inclined.",
