                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Bad Reviews Are Sour Grapes",
                "reviewText": "In my opinion this is a good quality product worth buying that does everything it says it will. I used it to mount a 43 inch Vizio T.V. in our bedroom.After reading some of the bad reviews I had some reservations about purchasing this particular bracket but once I received it I found it to be exactly as described. I had no issues, what-so-ever, with the install. To me the bad reviews seem like either sour grapes or the competition is just trying to sabotage their competitors with falsely written bad reviews.Addressing some of the issues mentioned in those bad reviews:This is a full motion mount. It will tilt left or right slightly but that actual alignment is supposed to be handled when installing the bracket. That is why they provide a level. Still it can be adjusted slightly after install.Secondly, people who do not own any tools should not be trying to install mechanical devices on their own and then complain about. It's not hard to install but you do need to have the most basic of mechanical skills and some tools.Thirdly, There are no T.V. mounts that are designed to be installed directly into a drywall wall surface. For safety reasons they always require being mounted to one of the 2X4 wall studs unless, of course this is being mounted to a brick wall.If you don't know how to locate a wall stud for mounting then you should probably hire someone to mount this for you.Finally the tilt, swing and swivel adjustments do need some tweaking in my opinion so they move more easily and have better freedom of movement. They do come snugged down a little too tightly from the factory in my opinion. These are all completely adjustable with the right Allen wrench and at minimum a pair of pliers or a small crescent wrench. Open ended or box wrenches would be better. A socket wrench is best.With all that said finding a wall stud is the hardest part of the install. Once a 2x4 wall stud is located the rest goes pretty smoothly. I had no problems with any of the hardware. If you are stripping out screws or snapping off the head of screws or bolts then you either have the wrong size screw, the wrong thread pattern on the screw or you have cross threading the screw when you installed it. Don't do that!Also these screws do not require 40 foot pounds of torque so, very simply, do not over tighten them.Any screw head will snap off if you continue to over torque it once it is tight, or if you have it cross threaded and try to force it into the hole. If you find yourself having to force a bolt or screw, Stop! something is wrong so back it out and try again. I found nothing wrong with the hardware provided. These are not junk screws that are not too soft for the job they are designed to do. I did not find any that were too soft, misthreaded or with bad heads.Over all these is a great bracket with nice features, quality construction and it is very secure.I had plenty of range of tilt and it does hold the TV securely in whatever position I set it for.You will need a drill and drill bit, some basic wrenches, basic screwdrivers and Allen wrenches and at the very least a crescent wrench for adjusting the tension on all the pivot points. Box wrenches would be better. Sockets would be best.So to all those people who felt compelled to write bad reviews, if you don't own a tool box that is not the manufacturers fault. If you don't have any of the most basic of mechanical skills that are needed that also is not the manufacturers fault. And if you choose not to follow the instructions, or try to take shortcuts, that absolutely is not the manufacturers fault. That's a you thing.Quit writing bad reviews because of your own lack of ability, lack of understanding or your lack of willingness to follow the instructions.. I am so tired of the 3 or 4 percent of people who seem that they are never happy with anything or feel compelled to fill their days by writing bad reviews on the internet. SOURGRAPES! Grow up.I can assure you that this is a quality product and I personally had no problems installing it. It took me about 2 hours to complete the install including readjusting all the pivot points to my liking.I would buy these item again if i needed it and I would refer this item to a friend. You can buy this item with confidence. It's a good wall mount.Once last thing to all you sour grapes people just so you know. I do not work for the manufacturer or Amazon, nor have I been paid or compensated in any way to write a favorable review. I am a 65 year old retiree living in Northern Michigan. I just felt compelled to clear a few things up for those people who are looking to purchase an item like this. Especially after reading the bad reviews and the reason those people gave for writing those bad reviews.Sour grapes!!!SincerelyKelly",

                "reviewText": "The wife and I are getting older and the small TV we had in the closet on a dresser was too small for us to read the guide and any lettering on screen. There was. NO PLACE to put a larger TV in the room the layout where we could both see it from the bed- except between out two closets. I had purchased a 43\" TV at Christmas so I needed a mount that could fit in the limited space and still move out far enough to open the closet doors. This mount proved to be perfect! Most of the time we can open the doors enough to not even have to move the TV to either side, but if needed it can swing completely out of the way. I did have to cut a small board to fit in-between the closet doors so the screws would go into the framing wood, but that was a simple fix. and the mount base hides it anyway. The mount is sturdy and moves easily. It comes with multiple mounting options and the hardware needed. Very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "You will need at least minimal DIY skills to properly hang this mount.Positive location of the middle of a 2x4 stud is paramount for a successful and safe mounting. This, and all other instructions must be adhered to. Read them carefully BEFORE beginning.The above statements would hold true for any product for mounting a TV on a wall.That said, the job is not difficult, and very satisfying in the end.An electronic stud finder will be a big help in locating a stud, and specifically, the CENTER of the stud, as the mounting holes NEED TO BE STRAIGHT, AND IN THE CENTER OF THE STUD. They also need to be drilled to a specified depth. To accomplish that, position the drill in the chuck, using a ruler to measure the amount of drill that sticks out, then tighten the chuck. Drill the hole until the chuck just touches the wall.Only three holes are required to be drilled. The rest of the process is just putting things together and insuring all screws and bolts are correctly installed and tightened sufficiently ... but not overtightened. Attaching the TV to the mount is a breeze, and leveling it is simple, as well. Once finished, you will be able to swing your TV into the perfect viewing position, and stow it nearly flat against the wall when not in use.",
