                "reviewText": "It's hard to provide a ton of detail for a wall mount, but I wanted one that had a small footprint on the wall and allowed multiple viewing angles in a small home office (depending if I was at my desk, on my exercise bike on the other side of the room, etc.). The \"premium\" ones at Best Buy were over $200 for the features/functionality this model has, which is probably a 200-300% markup over what they used to be.Installation was simple (two heavy lag bolts into a wall stud, 2-4 screws in the back of the TV) and the wall mount works as advertised, letting me twist, tilt, and swivel to my heart's content. I couldn't find a good angle to take pictures (it's behind a big old TV, after all), but this wall mount is built well and works great for most home uses. Also, the TV I mounted was a 50\" but the mount seemed pretty universal for larger or smaller models as well. As long as you hit a wall stud while mounting, it's not going anywhere.Anyway, bottom line...this is a great wall mount at a great price. Stay away from big box stores for stuff like this since you waste hundreds of dollars for the convenience.",

                "reviewText": "The ELIVED UL Listed TV Wall Mount has undoubtedly transformed my TV-watching experience, adding a touch of elegance and functionality to my living room. Designed to accommodate TVs ranging from 26 to 60 inches, this full-motion mount provides a host of features that enhance both the aesthetic appeal and viewing convenience.Installation was remarkably straightforward, thanks to the clear and concise instructions included in the package. I was able to mount my 50-inch TV with relative ease, even without extensive DIY experience. The provided hardware, including various screw sizes and wall anchors, catered to different wall types and ensured a secure installation.The swivel and tilt capabilities of this TV mount are where it truly shines. With a swivel range of 180 degrees and a tilt range of 15 degrees up and down, finding the perfect viewing angle for any seat in the room has become a breeze. This level of flexibility has transformed family movie nights into a more inclusive experience, as everyone can now enjoy an optimal view.The build quality of the ELIVED TV wall mount is commendable. Constructed with durability in mind, it feels robust and capable of holding my TV with confidence. The UL listing further adds to the peace of mind, knowing that the product has undergone rigorous testing to meet safety standards.One feature that deserves special mention is the cable management system. The integrated clips and channels help keep cables organized and hidden, contributing to a clean and clutter-free appearance. It's a small detail that makes a significant difference in maintaining the aesthetic appeal of your entertainment setup.However, one minor drawback I encountered was the limited vertical adjustment range. While the tilt function is helpful, it would have been even better if the mount allowed for greater vertical movement to accommodate taller viewers or different seating arrangements.In summary, the ELIVED UL Listed TV Wall Mount is a solid choice for enhancing your TV viewing experience. Its swivel and tilt capabilities, coupled with a sturdy build and thoughtful cable management, offer convenience and elegance to any living space. Although a slightly greater vertical adjustment range would have been appreciated, this wall mount remains a reliable and versatile option for mounting TVs in the 26-60 inch range.",
