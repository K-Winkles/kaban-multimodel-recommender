                "reviewText": "All other tv mounts I\u2019ve purchased over the years have had an array of lengths and thicknesses of bolts to connect the mount to the actual tv. This mount has a couple short/ thin (approx 1/8\u201d)thread pattern bolts, none of which fit my new 43\u201dSamsung (requires approx 1/4\u201d). Fortunately I saved the extra bolts from a couple other previously purchased tv mounts and found 4 bolts the right size. It would have been hard to find the correct size at a store otherwise. The mount itself is great. Easy to assemble and if you have a stud in a good spot and center the lag bolt into the stud, none of the problems some report of falling off the wall are any concern. This mount definitely requires a stud or solid core wall to properly mount.",

                "reviewText": "The mount is sturdy and I have no fear of it falling from the wall, the swivel functions on it are very nice. While it was easy to install and the instructions were pretty clear, if you've never put up a TV mount like me it is time consuming. It also doesn't sit straight when you first set it up which I saw a few other reviews complaining about and I did verify that I set the base up straight so I'm not sure what's causing it to tilt, but after 1.5-2hrs to get it all mounted I don't care enough to figure it out now. Ill update with the fix if I figure it out later.",
