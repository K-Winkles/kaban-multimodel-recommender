I can slowly move the TV away from the wall, but then I have to physically reach behind the TV to the mount itself to position the TV where I want it. Hopefully over time it will loosen up a little.",

                "reviewText": "I am using this mount with a 72-pound, 75-inch TV. It feels surprisingly solid, and holds the TV quite rigidly, with just a little but of \"sagging\" when the TV is pulled more than a few inches away from the wall. Please note that if your wall studs are 24 inches apart (like mine), this mount technically can span that distance, but then you will have little or no horizontal adjustability. Therefore, you might not be able to center your TV where you want it unless you extend the TV away from the wall by at least a couple of inches. You might have to do what I did to be able to center the mount where you want it: I removed a roughly 2-foot by 3-foot section of drywall (the longer sides were horizontal), attached the mount to a similarly sized 0.5-inch thick plywood panel (using through-bolts, nuts, and washers), and attached the plywood panel to the exposed wall studs (using strong screws). If you measure everything carefully, you can get the mount centered where you want it. I didn't really need to remove any drywall, but I wanted my TV to be as close to the wall as possible.",
