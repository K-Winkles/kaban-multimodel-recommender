It cam equickly and in a very compact package.I was suprised by the compact size and ease of installation this mount came with. It even came with an assortment of mounting screw sizes, sothe little TV mounted quickly. I was able to find one stud in the wall into which I put two drywall screws through an assortment of pre-drilled holes. The mounting plate on the television slipped easily onto the wall plate and there doesn't seem any way for the thing to fail.Upon mounting the Dg Kennel television I immediately ordered a second mount for the large television in my family room and the whole thing went together in a few minutes. This is a good deal and quite a bargain.",
