                "reviewText": "I use one of these to help free up space and get a 24-inch TV off my desk and onto the wall. Solid enough for maybe up to a 32 inch but surely couldn\u2019t handle any more than that. To be frank, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for anything bigger than a 24 inch because one thing I don\u2019t like about it is how the end of the arm mount catches the TV back mount and causes an extra amount of fumbling around to get it to go on securely and that\u2019s a bit irritating when you have all the TV\u2019s weight in your hands. Other than that, it comes with all the necessary hardware to install on a single stud mount easy enough and does what it should.",
