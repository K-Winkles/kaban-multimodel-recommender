                "reviewText": "This product is poorly designed and very hard to mount to the wall. The tilt up and down bracket is extremely hard to tighten the nut with the provided wrench. Also the adjustment nut to adjust from left to right is extremely hard to get to after mounting my 22 inch monitor to the wall.I am mechanically inclined and it took 1-1/2 hours to mount to the wall with my wife helping me.My advise, do not waste your money to purchase this product.",

                "reviewText": "This comes in a nice little, heavy box. Heavy duty and was a bit stiff to use its motions and so far, after a bit of movement and a teeny bit of some oil, moves great now but still holds in whatever position you set it too. Got it mounted directly into some wooden studs and mounted my old Panasonic plasma TV. For those of that know, plasmas were/are VERY heavy and this thing is holding it up quite well.",

                "reviewText": "It should be titled \"Tilt OR swivel\". The mount only moves one way, so if you mount it one way, it tilts up and down. Turn it 180 and mount it, it moves side to side. No way does this thing \"swivel\". I'm mounting a bunch of video monitors to a wall. I don't need it to swivel, just need it to be cheap. These things work fine.",

It's easy to assemble and mount and has nice articulation to make the tv viewable from any part of the room. It came with all of the screws and hardware needed to mount it. Good price too.",
