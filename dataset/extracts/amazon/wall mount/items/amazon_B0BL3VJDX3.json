                "reviewText": "If all you want to do is hang your smallish TV flat on the wall without all the fancy tilt and twist complications of other designs, this one fills the bill.Pros:* Simple, light 3 piece design.* Surprisingly well constructed and finished.* Fits all standard modern TV bracket mounting patterns, including 100 x 100.* Lots of adjustablility for both TV and wall mount options.* Comes with standard screws for the TV mount, in case you no longer have those that came with it.* Brain-dead simple to install. Screw the mount to the wall; hang the TV.Cons - none, actually.It's refreshing to find a simple design that does a basic job well at a good price.",
