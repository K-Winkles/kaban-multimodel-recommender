                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This was a great TV mount for my new Fire TV 50 inch. My wife always wanted our TV mounted on the wall so that she could swivel it outward and watch it in the kitchen while she's cooking. This mount allows for just that.I recommend watching a video or two online to get a basic idea of how to install this thing. The instructions are pretty basic - just pictures - and if you have never done this before, just pictures isn't enough (at least not for me). I took off one star for that. Fortunately the VESA mounting system works for all VESA compatible TVs/Monitors. There are a LOT of options of course, and figuring out which one works for your TV is the only real hard part.The package includes a dizzying array of hardware to accommodate all the various VESA configurations. It also includes drywall expanders in case you can't find a stud - which I think is crazy! I STRONGLY recommend you DO NOT use these and mount this directly to a 2x4 in your wall! Once mounted on a 2x4, you can feel how solid and strong the hold is on this mount. I think drywall expanders would be dicey at best to hold the TV safely.To adjust the horizontal direction or to pull the TV out further from the wall is simple and easy. The motion is smooth and easy to do. Adjusting the TILT is not so easy and requires you to loosen two nuts behind the TV. That is the ONLY thing that is even remotely annoying about the operation of this mount. Though I really don't know if any other TV mount would allow for an easier tilt adjustment. Fortunately, I'm happy to set a slight downward tilt and don't foresee adjusting that at all.The mount has a good range of motion and can almost allow you to turn the TV at a 45 degree angle - almost - but not quite. I'd say it's more like a 30 degree rotation. But that's pretty good for today's wide screen TV's!Overall I think this is an excellent value and works perfectly!",

I was initially worried that the mount would not fit the TV, as it is on the older side. This mount can adapt to ANYTHING. The instrux were very helpful. It was not plug and play to install, but we got it done. you *must* have studs to which to mount it. Super quality material (solid metal). Range of motion is awesome. Would definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "It's sturdy and well-constructed, ensuring a secure hold for my TV. However, the only area that could be improved is the range of motion in terms of how far the TV can be turned. While it's a minor limitation, the mount's inability to swivel or tilt as much as expected might be a drawback for those seeking more adjustability. Overall, it's a reliable and durable mount that secures the TV well, but it could benefit from greater flexibility in movement.",

Dismount comes with every screw, nut, bolt, washer, and mounting template that you will possibly need. It accommodates a large range of TV sizes. Not only does it adjust the left or right, but you can angle it down. When it is folded against the wall, you can\u2019t even see the mount. I highly recommend this TV mount!",

Just 3 bolts in the wall, attach the plate to the back of the TV, then 2 small screws to secure the TV to the arm.",
