                "reviewText": "It came with a bubble level, and lots of screws for different methods of hang a tv. I used a small drill bit and drilled until I found both edges of the stud. I knew where the stud was, but not the middle. Then I drilled a hole all the way into the stud, where the lag bolts went. The reason I needed to find the middle of the stud, is because the lag Bolts are so large, I didn't want to take a chance of just splitting the stud behind the wall. The older the house, the more likely it will split, but it can happen in new homes too. If you split the stud, It wont hold much weight. The pilot drill holes were important too, so this wouldn't happen. It took me about a hour, getting it right. It took me a while to decide how high, I wanted the Tv. I measured the tv while it was in the box. I didn't realize the mount was not in the middle and assumed it was. So, I had to take it back down and lower the bracket. I move the top hole on the bracket to the middle hole. I will have to chalk the top hole. Be careful not to over tighten the bolt and strip out the hole. It wont hold anything if you strip it. The plate mounted directly onto the Tv, without those extra arms, that stick out in the picture. That was nice. I installed a 55 in Hisense Roku Tv. Because the arm swings, it is easy to find a stud close enough to mount it to and just swing it to the side or middle, whatever makes it line up where you want it. The pro's say 61 in. to the bottom of the Tv is just right. I wanted mine at the level I could recline, all the way back and watch Tv, without my chin on my chest. So the bottom of my Tv ended up about 66 inches off the floor. That angle is not to bad, for the folks sitting on the sofa either. You need need to take the time and tape some cardboard up or something and see what works for you, because this is not something you want to start all over again. Over the fireplace is not recommended for several reasons. If you use the fireplace, it is to hot and Smokey for the electronics and It is rarely a comfortable viewing position. But, If you like me and that is where you really want it, who cares, do it anyway. I liked the product and the price. It does the job. It is as easy as any to install. Just be careful, handling that large TV, these new TV's are more fragile than an egg. I broke two so far, at different times (in the past). It is expensive to be careless or in a bad mood while installing.",
