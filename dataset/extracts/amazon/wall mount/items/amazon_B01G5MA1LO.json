                "reviewText": "It may say it can handle somewhat larger TVs, but our newer (38 lb) 65\" is causing some sag in the hinge. It anchors securely into the stud in the wall. I only bought this because I couldn't find a mount that would span 24\" for a decent price. My usual practice when the studs are 24\" is to mount a board spanning 2, then attach a 16\" mount to the board. It is a bit obtrusive, but is sturdier than this.",
