                "reviewText": "This simple TV cord hiding system is easy to install and elegant. It doesn\u2019t offer more advanced features to extend power outlets or provide in-wall wiring conduits, but if all you need is a simple hole with a nice cover to position behind a wall mounted TV with an exit hole/cover down closer to the floor, than this is probably a good solution for you. It includes the rubber hole covers, which are well designed and stay in place without clips or fasteners, and a good quality hole drilling bit (perfectly sized for the hole cover, obviously).Some tips: You will need a drill and a good stud finder, since the holes need to be between wall studs (and you will want to avoid accidentally drilling into a water pipe or electrical wires). Also, the drill bit is designed for dry wall (maybe even with a thin wood paneling), ideally 3/4\u201d thick, but not more than 1\u201d total thickness. It is best that the interior of the wall does not have insulation in it, if it does it will be difficult or impossible to snake the power cord and other cords thru the wall cavity. It is best if there is a piece of furniture under the TV, since this will hide the cable hole closer to the floor. If the TV power cord is not long enough consider snaking a good quality extension cord thru instead of the TV power cord (probably not to code in most places, but neither is a TV power cord).",

Several months ago I purchased an 85\" TV for my family room and had a professional install done for it. The installer used a kit similar to this to hide the wires, so I decided that I should do the same with my office TV. I went to my local electronics retailer only to find the least expensive kit they offered was $179.00. I went to several other retailers and found less expensive kits, but none that had as nice an appearance as this kit. This even came with a hole saw!!! I ordered it and couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome. Installation was quick and easy, even having to deal with an insulated wall. Well worth the money, great value.",

                "reviewText": "Previously, I have used the much more expensive plug extensions through the wall. I tried this option due to the low cost and after the simple installation, I realized some benefits to this product that I would not have realized without trying it. I was at first hesitant thinking that I like the looks of the more expensive options better, but I then realized that I would prefer that only when the TV is off the wall. Which will not be the case.After drilling the holes in the wall, I noticed insulation in the wall. I thought this would be a problem with feeding the cables. However, I used a tape measure to feed through the wall, used a velcro strip to attach the cable to the end of the tape measure, and pulled it back through. I also realized that if I bought one of the more expensive ones, it would have compressed the insulation. So, I actually like this solution better.The hole caps are sturdy with a snug fit. The cables fit nicely through the cap. The cable hidden and it looks great!I'm buying another one for the bedroom now.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought and installed tons of TV cord hiders. This particular product was the easiest I have ever installed. It looks great too. I checked stud locations and chose a spot near my outlet and devices. I drilled a hole with the provided hole saw and then made another one halfway up the wall where the TV would hang. I installed both rubber pieces and ran the cords through them. It took less than 10 minutes and no more wires are hanging out under the TV. Too easy!",
