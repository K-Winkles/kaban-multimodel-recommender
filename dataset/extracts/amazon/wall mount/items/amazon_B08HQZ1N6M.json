                "reviewText": "I purchased this to mount a 50\" television on the wall. I was a little concerned about all the weight resting on one stud, but it's no problem. Everything is super sturdy.My only real complaint is that to tilt the television up and down you have to reach around behind the television, loosen two bolts, adjust the angle, and then retighten the bolts without moving the angle. If you're only doing it once it's not a big deal, but if you want to adjust the angle frequently it's not the most convenient process.The mount came with a zillion spacers and bolt sizes/depths so it's hard to imagine a television (within the weight limit) that wouldn't work with it. Mine's mounted in a corner and I use it as both a television and computer monitor. Works great.",
