                "reviewText": "This unit is everything that I would want in a TV mount. It's well constructed and strong enough to hold a huge TV with ease. The fact that it swivels and tilts is great because I can easily watch my 50 inch TV from either my easy chair or while in my bed.Setting it up was a breeze thanks to the fact that the mount comes with a template, a leveling tool as well as Velcro ties to help keep the cables tidy. I highly recommend this unit without hesitation.",

The biggest controllable variables for a product like this are 1) A well made product that you don't regret installing, and 2) Easy and clear instructions, that clearly walk you through the process and let you know what you need and when. This product delivers on both fronts. This mount is well built and functional with clean design an minimal complexity to achieve full advertised function. The instructions are laid out well. They clearly explain everything needed up front. All included materials are clearly labeled and easy to find. The process for installation is clear and laid out to be understandable even by those with limited tool experience. Overall, a solid installation experience.",

                "reviewText": "We got this mount to replace a previous mount when we upgraded the living room TV and were moving the 43 inch from there to the bedroom. The area that we installed it in was between two doors so we needed a mount that would fit it exactly in between the doors so that it didn't block them. My old mount was a swing out and was on a stud that wasn't centered in the space so it wasn't going to work with a bigger TV. This one was easy to install, came with all the hardware and a cute little level. I like how it pulls straight out instead of swinging but we can also angle it down since it's over a light switch. The bracket also allowed us to install on the studs without being limited on positioning because it's pretty wide and now perfectly centered. Also got it for a good price, so happy about that!",

I gave it four stars because it only came with 3 bolts for the studs to mount. That would have really screwed me if I was able to use it. I\u2019m sure they would send you new ones no questions asked, but imagine how inconvenient it would be if this happened to you the week before the Super Bowl & hopefully you didn\u2019t expect a bunch of people over. They do sell extender supports for larger spacing, but it\u2019s sold separately. So be prepared if you plan on buying a wall mount, but over all the mount itself seems good & really simple to setup based on how far I got before finding out I was \u201cscrewed\u201d lol. I could have called them, got a bolt & the extender bars but when it would have all been said & done it would take me till Super Bowl weekend to get this mounted, so I just went to Best Buy and over paid for a larger wall mount.",

                "reviewText": "I've been purchasing Mounting Dream mounts for several years. Started buying them for home use and was so impressed I also began purchasing them for work. Eight years later, and I am still purchasing them and recommending them to friends, family and coworkers. Dozens of mounts later, and I am very happy with every single one I've purchased and installed.They have so many options, they're one of the best out there. Whether you need a flat-mount, arm/articulated mount with short or long arms, light duty or heavy duty, they will likely have a mount for you. I absolutely love their dual arm articulated mounts, as you can not just extend the TV away from the wall and back, but you can shift it left, right, or center, and bring it back against the wall on either of the three positions. And if you mount these against wall studs or on concrete walls, the mounts will be sturdy and you will not worry about moving your TV when needed.You get all you need to mount these to most TVs out there, and that includes wall mounting bolts and screws for the TV. Make sure you confirm the type of mounting your TV needs (look in the manual or the back of the TV) so you know what you need. These mounts are very flexible when it comes to providing a variety of standard VESA screws, washers and extenders, but some TVs are not exactly mount friendly. Measure the distance between the holes and confirm the mount will support them. Like I said, most should, but you never know.Don't toss the extra screws and washers! You might need these in the future should you replace your TV. These mounts are so good, I'd guarantee that you will use them with several TVs as long as the stand can support them.Packaging is excellent. Box is sturdy and componets are well packaged so as not to move and bang around in transit. Screws, washers and extenders are all bagged according to type and size in clear packaging, so you can select the ones you need easily.Lastly, it's a small detail, but it's a nice one - you get a free level. Although I have several \"pro-grade\" levels, I like to use these as they're smaller and can balance them on the arms as a second level. Plus - who doesn't need extra levels once in a while!?In short - Excellent mounts, excellent brand.",

                "reviewText": "I am really pleased with this mounting kit and highly recommend it to anyone needing one for a 26-55\" TV wall Mount.There are a few different kits available depending on the Wall Stud Distance and one or two arm mounts. I choose the two arm mount 16\" Spacing kit.Like always shipping was free and really fast to my small remote town via Canada Post. Very pleased how fast it came.It was nicely packaged and when opening it, I found everything nicely labeled and packaged nicely. The instructions with the kit were really well done I feel, and easy to follow.Some of the Bonus Features I found were:1) Included a really nice HDMI Cable2) Includes Not Only a Wall Template but a small Bubble Level to connect to the wall template, but also a larger level for other leveling needs.3)Contains handy velcro straps for cable mounting.Mounting the wall mount was pretty simple, I found where the studs were on the wall and marked them with a pencil, I then found the right position for my mount using my markings and the included template. It includes a small level you mount to the template and this allows you to get it nice and straight. I then predrilled the mount holes and removed the template.I was painting the wall, so did found the locations and predrilled holes before doing drywall repairs/painting, just in case.When the time came to mount the wall mount, I used the included lag bolts and put them into the wall studs I pre drilled earlier.You use the included larger level to get your wall mount just right and then tighten in the bolts.The kit comes with a good selection of bolts, spacers and washers to mount the mounting pieces to your actual TV. I found I needed longer bolts, but the spacers etc worked perfect.Just lift the TV up now and attach it onto the wall mount. Once on, tighten the lock screws and its on there good.You can then make the adjustments like tilt and any fine tune straightening.I really like how well this kits is made, and all the included things to make installation as simple as it could possibly be.Being able to pull the TV Away from the Wall and move at angles if we are out on the back deck is really handy and moves smooth.I would highly recommend this kit to anyone needing one, it really made installing my first TV wall mount a breeze and I feel comfortable with my TV hanging on it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Watch the video for all the details or read on. I first bought one mount as I was skeptical of the quality given the low cost, especially compaired to local purchases for 2 or 3 times the price. The mount is very solid and comes with good enough instructions and ample mounting hardware options. This is for 16\" on center studs so be prepared to have a tv centered between your studs. If you have 17\" inch spacing or you want the tv in an exact spot you will need to mount a board on the wall or pull the tv out a bit and swing it to the side. I choose this model because of the variety of Vesa mounting options that would fit all 3 of my tvs I was planning on wall mounting. After very helpful emails from the manufacturer he confirmed although my 65\" was above the reccommended size range for the mount it is newer and lighter then my 42\" and 40\" therefore would support it. The mount has a number of up and down options depending on your imput locations. Choosing where to mount the stand vertically and which spots to bolt it to the tv took the most time, however I am extremely picky. I hung my heavy 100lbs old sony first. Its was so solid and worked so well I purchased 2 more mounts and have hung all tv in my house. After about a year my only complaint is with the weight / leverage and tight joints it takes a bit of force to swivel the tv. I lubricated the joint which helped but I must be careful to not flex my very expensive thin panel TV. This however I think is required opposed to a sloppy or sagging mount. The other thing you must consider is having the swivel options makes the tv sit out from the wall 2 inches.Reccomendation: Purchase! Maybe x 3Let me know if you found my video and review helpful.
