                "reviewText": "I am not a fix-it guy. I was concerned buying this and I assumed I would be hiring someone to do the labor. Once I review the instructions I decided to mount it myself. I had to go buy the correct size drill bit that is not included. I also had to purchase a stud finder. I used a large level instead of the tiny one they included. The install job has 2 small steps that require a second person. I learned something new to me about finding the exact center of studs in house walls. Find the stud first and mark it. Then you use a small metal spike. It has a name I just used a large nail. You nail it into the wall closer and closer to the stud and find the exact edges of the beam. This gives you a perfect strong center mount. I'll probably use that again later in life. Everything is pretty easy the directions are good. I had to go back and relevel it a bit once it was mounted but all those screws are accessable. One thing I wondered when purchasing was if it swung around both directions and it does. Pay attention to the distance from the corner of the wall the instructions change that distance if it's mounted left or right. The arm is actually really big I can swing it out several feet and turn it to face the kitchen. Again towards the couch. Again to center on the other couch. When we're done we can push it against either wall flat or the corner. Main lesson is I'm not a crafty wood working guy and I got it mounted. The set back was just a $2 drill bit. I'm glad I did it, surprised I didn't need a pro to mount it. I learned something about finding studs and it works exactly as I had hoped. Zero regrets and I'm even proud of myself.",

                "reviewText": "This mount is very heavy duty, very sturdy, simple to install, and has the best range of motion of any tv mount I have owned. It cost a little more than other corner mounts but you wont regret the purchase. I bought two other corner mounts that were half the price and ended up sending both of them back because they were garbage. The TV I mounted is only 43inches, but I would not hesitate to put a 75inch TV on this mount. It is rated for a max of 75inches, and not sure what the weight was, but it has a fairly heavy rating. I almost never take the time to rate products I purchase, but I was so pleased with this one that I felt like I should pass my satisfaction on to other customers. If you are looking for a great corner mount don't waste your time on the cheap ones because you wont be happy with them. I would purchase this mount again without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "This mount was easy to install, sturdy, and overall a great buy! Very smooth operating as well: the TV looks like it's floating so super cool. It does not get super tight against the wall so note the dimensions, but it swings out and around so much, it is worth it. The only issue is that the plastic anchors they send if you can't hit the studs are worthless, so make sure you get some metal anchors if you can't hit studs. I put a 65-inch OLED on there, and used 6 screws (not just the four they sent) because the big TVs are super heavy and because I live in a 150-year old building that was refurbished, the studs are metal and needed to ensure great support.",

                "reviewText": "This is holding up a 60 inch TV at my house. We needed a pivot so we could access the side plugs on the TV as it is recessed into an alcove. This bracket telescopes and pivots so it actually does more than we need it to. The tricky part was that the TV is not centered on the bracket once installed. So if you center the bracket on the wall, your TV will actually be off center once on the bracket. You need to install the bracket off center to adjust if having your TV in a center position is important to you. This is not addressed in the instructions at all. However, the instructions did come with a mounting template and a lot of hardware for many different type of TVs. When the TV is telescoped out, the bracket does have some bounce or sway to it so it does make me nervous about how strong it is if kept in that position for a long time. You will need to have some serious wall anchoring to accommodate that position.",

                "reviewText": "I have an L-shaped living room and wanted a way to turn my TV 90 degrees to the left so I could play active sports games without moving the coffee table or bumping into the couch behind me. This mount fits the bill and then some! It actually turns more than 90 degrees in either direction, so if you wanted to watch TV around a corner, I think you technically could.The mount is super sturdy and was easy to install by myself (I'm a 50-something woman who's very handy). I didn't have any of the problems some other reviewers noted. I was specifically trying to figure out why so many people thought the template was the wrong size, but I couldn't find anything wrong with it. The only thing that confused me for a minute were the spacers. My TV is slightly tapered on the back, so I was trying to find a spacer configuration that would keep the hanger bars level. Turns out I was over-thinking it and didn't need spacers at all. Oops. :o}My only worry with this mount is that it's a little tight and hard to move, so I can't move it by grabbing the TV and jockeying it around. I have one of those ultra-thin 50\" Samsung TV's, and it's a very, very delicate little thing, so I have to reach behind the TV and awkwardly pull on the bars to get them where I want them. It's a small problem, but it's something to be aware of if you're in a similar situation.All-in-all, I'm thrilled with this purchase! It does exactly what I needed it to do, and the price isn't way out in the stratosphere. Definitely recommend!",
