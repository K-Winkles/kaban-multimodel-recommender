                "reviewText": "The included wall template helps you to locate where the lag bolts should go on the wall. They included a small bubble level, which is a nice touch. Managed to get the entire thing mounted in about 2 hours, start to finish. The instructions are adequate, but you have to pay attention to the spacers on the back of the TV - the written instructions don't mention how to adapt to any curvature of the back of your TV - - though the drawings *do* depict that. They are smart to tell you to mount the brackets to the TV FIRST - I strongly recommend that you do exactly that, no matter how much you might want to drill into the wall as the first step. This also has the added benefit of letting you discover if you TV is (or isn't) compatible with this mount! Again - take advantage of this, and mount the brackets to the TV FIRST. Good, strong TV mount for flush/straight/non-tilting situations. I will (and have) bought multiple products from this same vendor, as they have all lived up to their billing!",

We looked at mounts at the stores that were over 200$ and none of them were this flush.The mount was super easy to install. The very first this you do is make sure that your TV\u2019s VESA will fit the mount. We have a 65 inch Sony OLED A80L. The mount fit perfectly.Also make sure you have the four little silver adapter things for the tv mount that came with your tv (if you have the Sony we do they came in a small pack labeled VS.)The wall part was super easy to install, just a simple pre drill and socket wrench install. Cute little level worked well.The quick release pulls are nice esp if you only have two ppl trying to put the tv on the mount.Took my husband (and my expert instruction reading skills) about 45 min all in.Super happy with this Amazon find.",

Si bien hay una opci\u00f3n de 32-55\", me quise ir a lo seguro y por un precio ligeramente mas alto compr\u00e9 la opci\u00f3n de 42-70\". El soporte queda muy resistente y lo m\u00e1s importante es que me d\u00e1 la tranquilidad de que aguanta el peso de mi televisor.El material con que est\u00e1 hecho se v\u00e9 de muy buena calidad, robusto y muy resistente. La instalaci\u00f3n es muy sencilla y me gusta que el soporte que va anclado a la pared tiene espacio para mover el televisor hacia lo lados. El sistema de seguros que tiene es autom\u00e1tico, solo cuelgas la TV y se ajusta solo, de no hacerlo, tiene unos cordones que puedes jalar conf acilidad para hacer el ajuste.La caja incluye todo lo necesario para instalarlo (exceptuando, l\u00f3gicamente la herramienta) e incluye adem\u00e1s un nivel y una hoja con la gu\u00eda para marcar la pared.Absolutamente recomendable!",
