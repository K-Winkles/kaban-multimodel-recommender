                "reviewText": "I had a very simple need for mounting my television. I didn't need anything really fancy but I did need it to be able to tilt down because I had a glare from a window behind the TV. This mount was much lower price than many of the other ones I considered, so I thought I would give it a try. It comes in a small box and you wonder is this thing going to work! But when you put it together, it's very strong, easy to install, and tilts down 10\u00b0. I have a 65 inch television mounted to it and it stands just a few inches from the wall. That 10\u00b0 tilt means when I'm sitting down, I don't get the window glare. It has two pulldown strings in the back that release the lock and allows you to tilt it. They are a bit short and, with how close it is to the wall, I had to work a little bit to get my hand behind it and pull them. But I only needed to do it once because I don't plan on moving it. The tilt function is very smooth and now it's locked in place. I'm extremely happy and saved lots of money on features I didn't need.",

                "reviewText": "\"With the freedom of my new home and no more concerns about landlords or security deposits, I was eager to hang my TV. Enter the Mounting Dream UL Listed TV Mount for Most 37-75 Inch TVs. Here's my experience with this versatile TV mounting solution.Pros:Ease of Installation: Although I had someone else handle the installation, it appeared relatively straightforward. The mount's design and included instructions make the process accessible even for those with minimal DIY experience.Sturdy and Secure: Once installed, the Mounting Dream TV Mount provides a secure and stable platform for your TV. You can trust that your TV will remain safely attached to the wall.Cons:Size Compatibility: My TV, at 42 inches, seemed slightly too small for this mount. The bar on the back of the mount fit perfectly between the holes on the TV, preventing it from being adjusted to align with the wall stud. To overcome this, the person mounting my TV had to remove the bar and use only one half of the mount.Conclusion:The Mounting Dream UL Listed TV Mount is a reliable choice for securely hanging your TV. Its ease of installation and sturdy design make it a great option for DIY enthusiasts. However, if you have a smaller TV like mine, you may encounter compatibility issues, requiring some modification during installation. Despite this minor hiccup, the mount successfully achieves its primary goal of securely holding your TV in place.\"",

I prefer to use a tape measure anyways.The mounting brackets were easy to install, and even the big LCD was easy for me to put up by myself, mine was light, just big. it hooks on to the top rail, and use the straps connected to the bottom latches to set in to place. Pull, and it just snaps in.Well worth the money, looks nice, and was easy to install.",
