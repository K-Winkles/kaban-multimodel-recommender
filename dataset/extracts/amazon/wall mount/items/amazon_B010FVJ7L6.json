                "reviewText": "Talk about value for money!They have come a LONG way in tv mounts! I removed my old mount, from Costco, and exchanged it for this one and let me tell you! The base of this one, the lack of bulk behind the TV actually makes the room feel larger! I now have more available space on top of the fireplace due to it being set back by about 5 inches with this streamline design! And I have it tilted all the way forward, which means the bottom of our screen is even closer to the wall. Buying another mount for my son's rooms as well as my husband's man shack! Bye bye bulky thousand pound metal contraptions of the past! Oh, and this hold up my husband's 70inch Samsung TV.",
