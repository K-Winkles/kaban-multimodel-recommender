                "reviewText": "This mount comes with most of what you'll need to install this (Comes with level, nails, screws, velcro cable ties, but you'll need a hammer). There are two parts to this: the part that you attach to the TV VESA screw holes(two round plastic knobs that hook on the rack, and two at the bottom that stabilize your TV on the wall; the second part is the mount rack, which you nail to the wall. The installation holes in the mount rack are designed so that the nails go in at a downward angle. Once you have fixed the plastic pieces at the back of the TV, you slide them down into the slots on the rack mounted on the wall. The width of the knob spacing at the back of the TV is determined by the VESA type measurements of your TV.Note: There are two things to note with this mount. First, you have to install whatever cables on the back of the TV before you hang it up. Secondly, this mount installs very flat with a low profile. That is, there will be very little space between the wall and the TV. This means that you might have to invest in an angled power plug that drops to the side or straight down and not the regular kind that shoots straight out.I installed a 43 inch monitor this way. It weighs about 20 or so pounds, and so far, it seems to be holding up",

My husband is interested in sim racing and wanted to use the old TV instead of a small computer monitor. That\u2019s where this wall mount came in. It\u2019s easy to use. It is basically a long hook you fasten to a vertical surface.Installing it is easy, the mount has a row of several holes aligned horizontally so you can line them with a wall frame. This gives you flexibility since you can offset it horizontally with the wall frame. Another nice thing is that the pegs you attach to the VESA holes in the back of your TV have a mushroom shape, so when you hang the tv, the pegs slide into the slots very securely. The TV stays put.It worked well and is inexpensive at $16 plus tax.",
