Be warned: it's of a very low profile so if you're mounting something that has any cables that poke out the back (rather than the side or bottom) then this plainly won't work. It doesn't have any articulation either, so you better get it perfectly level in one go. Measure twice / drill once. That said, it's a good and inexpensive option for a small-medium TV or monitor.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for a 27\" monitor. My initial impression is this mount is very simple and intuitive to use. There is no tilt adjustment and you must remember to install the bottom locking screws to prevent accidentally lifting it off. This mount is incredibly slim, measuring only about 7/8\" thick, which makes the monitor really flush to the wall. The weight limit is listed at 66lbs, which seems believable to me given how simple it is constructed. Due to the mount's narrow width, it could potentially fall between two studs if you are inflexible with mounting location. I am happy with this mount and think it's a tremendous value.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Slim, low profile mount, great for small TVs or Monitors",
                "reviewText": "If you are looking to mount a smaller size TV and like it flush against the wall this is a simple option. The box claims it can hold 55lbs, but the Amazon listing claims 66lbs so there is some discrepancy on how much weight you can safely hang on this mount. Seeing that it only recommends using a 14-42 inch TV does eliminate some of the heavier options, so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem either way.The bracket can accommodate a nice variety of VESA sizes from 75mm to 200mm. M4, M5, M6 screws and washers are included, but no spacers or other sizes. Check your TV manual to see what it requires as you might have to purchase them separately. They also include a mini bubble level to ensure you are mounting this straight and screws with anchors to hang it on the wall. You\u2019ll need to mount this on concrete or wood attached to the studs in the wall. Never go straight into dry wall as it won\u2019t support the weight of the TV.Since this is so slim and low profile once you have the bracket mounted on the wall, and the 2 brackets attached to your TV, you just have to hang the TV on the bracket similar to how you would hang a picture on a hook. Safety screws are supplied that screw the the bracket to the wall once the TV is hung. However getting those screws on are a difficult since there is little space to get your hand behind the screen to screw it in. The larger the screen the more difficult it will be.Aside from that it\u2019s a pretty simple install that should fit a decent amount of TVs or monitors on the market. The price (under $10) at the time of writing this review is reasonable as well.",
