                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great wall mount for the price",
                "reviewText": "Great wall mount for the price.We had an old 20\" tube style TV that would not die, and it had been sitting on my wife's dresser in our bedroom. I know, we are behind the times a bit. :) So, we purchased a new 43\" LED TV during Black Friday. The wife now wanted the TV off of her dresser so she could reclaim some of her dresser space back. I did my research on what TV wall mounts to get. The consensus out there said Cheetah mounts were the best. I came across this one and noticed that it was about $10 cheaper than the lowest Cheetah Tilt wall mount. Reviews for this one was good. Being the cheapskate that I am, I went with this one. :) The mount came in a box. It consists of 3 main pieces (the wall mount bracket and 2 arms). It came with plenty of screws for the bracket and for your TV. The arms were already assembled. I laid the 3 main components on our bed to see how it all worked out. The top \"hook\" on each of the arm brackets hook onto the top part of the wall mount bracket which has like a lip for the hooks to hook on to. The bottom of each arm brackets also have a retractable hook. By pulling on the strap, you can move the hook down so you can lock the bottom part of the brackets on to the bottom part of the mount. The wall mount went up easily after finding the studs on the wall. I put the arm brackets on the back of our new TV. From there on, my wife and I put the TV on the wall mount. The top hooks went on the top part of the wall mount. We pulled the straps on the arms, made sure the bottom of the arm bracket was resting against the bottom of the lip of the wall mount, and released the straps so the hooks can lock into the bottom of the wall mount. Voila! New TV mounted on the wall. You can even slide the TV from left to right if you need to \"center\" the TV to the wall.I used the included leveler and it was leveled perfectly. I didn't have any issues like some of the other reviewers said. I doubled check with my own and it came out to be perfect also.Because of the height of our TV, we use the Tilt option. Probably didn't need to tilt it but my wife said she could see a slight difference in the viewing when it was tilted.Word of advice. Before you mount the wall mount bracket, make sure you have it to the spot that you want to put it in. Once those screws go into the wall, you don't want to move them. I suggest you cut out a card board of the same size of your TV and put it to where you think you want it to be. For us, my 13 year old son and I held the TV up to the spot that we thought we wanted it to be. The TV was on and my wife then laid on the our bed letting us know if the height was acceptable.Overall, a good purchase for the price. Metal was thick. Quality was nice. Installation was easy. I have seen other wall mounts with the same feature as this one for a lot more than. I'm sure they work just as well as this one. But why pay more? I would easily recommend this mount to anyone who is thinking about buying a more expensive model.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I would probably honestly get this again. The price is great, and its well made despite its shortcomings, and comes with good extras (level, HDMI cable). I would not recommend this if your audio/video out plugs are near the bottom of your TV. Getting the frame on the wall was easy, and so was attacking the braces to the TV. Everything is very straightforward, instructions are easy, and had plenty of hardware. The tough parts:1) even using the spacers provided, the TV is \"holy crap\" close to the wall (to be fair, it is advertised this way). It seems nice, but the issue is that it doesn't even leave enough room for the plugs. Power, HDMI, component, they all hit the wall. This makes tilting the TV difficult if they are on the bottom end of the unit, because they will hit the wall and prevent you from being able to tilt it fully. It also makes it difficult to lock in the bottom hooks, because you need to jam the TV into the wall and feel like you will break it, and there's a good chance the cords will get in the way.2) You cannot tilt the TV until AFTER you have the brackets 100% connected (aka the bottom half). This is tough because there is very little room to reach the screws once its on the wall. I was able to loosen them so it just kind of tilted forward and rested, but it creates an \"all or nothing\" situation in terms of tilt. You can either have it flush, or tilted 10 degrees, no trying to find a middle spot.Overall though, still happy with it. The price can't be beat.",

                "reviewText": "The Mounting Dream MD2268-MK Tilt TV Wall Mount was an excellent purchase for me. It was very easy to install. The included leveler is fairly cheap, but it works and was very helpful it getting the wall mount leveled. Even though the level is cheap, I have been using it a lot. It is very small and compact which is nice.The wall mount works great. It can hold between a 26\" TV to a 55\" TV. The wall frame is of good construction. The pieces are sturdy, but they are very lightweight. The bars attach to the TV, and they hook onto the frame attached to the wall. The tilt feature is nice to get the angle you want if the TV is mounted high.The included HDMI cable is a nice plus. I didn't need one, but getting one for free one can't complain. I have the included HDMI cable plugged into the TV, and I let it hang behind twist-tied so I have the cable easily available in case I need to plug a device to the TV. I don't want to have to take the TV off the wall just to plug and unplug a cable. The TV ends up being about 1 1/2\" from the wall with the wall frame there. Depending on the TV and where the ports and jacks are located, it can be hard to reach back to insert a cable.I definitely recommend this TV wall mount as a good buy. It is a very good price on Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime. the 2-day Free shipping is nice.",
