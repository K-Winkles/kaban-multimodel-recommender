                "reviewText": "It was for a 47\" LG TV set. I struggled with mounting the bracket in the back of the TV. Instructions were far from good and I finally realized I needed to use the biggest spacers to make it work. Once that was done, installing the mount to the wall was very easy. I liked the 3 screws in line so they go in the middle of the stud. It even came with a level gizmo so you can be sure your TV doesn't get mounted weird. The hardware is top quality and the mount is very sturdy with zero play. A limited amount of adjustment as far as tilting, up or down, and pulling off the wall but overall, a very good value for the price.",
