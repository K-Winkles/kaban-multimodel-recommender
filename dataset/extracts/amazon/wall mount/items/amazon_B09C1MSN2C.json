                "reviewText": "\"Please read entire instruction manual before you start installation and assembly. If you have any questions regarding the instructions or warnings, please contact your local distributor\". And that's pretty much the entire text of the assembly instructions. The rest is microscopic pictographs which tell you you'll also need a fence post with slat, a pencil, a drill with a phillips head bit, a Covid-19 test strip, and a disposable Kodak 110 camera from the 1980's.These brackets may be made in the USA, but the instruction manuals were outsourced to some other planet who's inhabitants have extremely sharp vision and communicate VIA rebus.If you have anything but 200x200, 300x300, 400x400, you're left trying to figure out how to attach the extender arms which do not lock into place at the correct angles and who's tabs just bend to fit (if you even have them at the right angles AND in the right holes to begin with). Fortunately, I was able to use the the 200x200 holes - no extension arms necessary (pfffft!!!). But If you have 400x200 or 400x300 or any odd numbered pattern, you'll need to contact that that other planet as to how to attach the arms AND use the supplied holes to mount TV at the same time, as there are NO LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS to help you with jack (nor warranty info or limitations included).Immediately after installation the hollow vertical support arm connected to my 27-pound 50\" TV (product advertises up to 55\" and 77 pounds) started buckling and the TV started to droop to the ground (which was 5 feet away). It was race to try and save my TV since I had already removed the supports that had held up the TV during installation. Couldn't remove the mount from the TV fast enough and busted my back trying to hold the TV from the front and and unscrew the mount at the back at the same time. Still can't move today.If you want a lot of head scratching, frustration, and a big dose of pain and suffering along with lost time and effort due to false advertising, these products are just what you need!",

Para la instalaci\u00f3n yo utilice una broca de 5/16 de pulgada y al ranurar hice los hoyos con un grado ligero de inclinaci\u00f3n descendente para dejar bien fijado el soporte. El soporte trae diferentes medidas muy adaptables a la mayor\u00eda de smarts tv. Chulada de producto, recomendado full.",
