You have alot of movement once you install. Moves side to side,, up and down even tilts. Very strong even has a very accurate templet. I bought 2 and for the price you can't find a better one at any price. 100% thumbs up",

Wall lag bolts were 1/2\" X 3-3.5\" long to secure into studs. The range of motion is perfect for what I needed. Doesn't move up or down but is able to tilt up/down and wide range of motion to turn the tv right or left.",
