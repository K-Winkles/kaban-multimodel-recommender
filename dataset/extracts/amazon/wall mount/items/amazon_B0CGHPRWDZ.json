When trying to adjust the position, there is a lot of flex, bounce, and torsion in the arm which I'm afraid of snapping if I were to adjust this daily from sit to stand position. I've already drilled several holes so will stick with it and I'm hoping this lasts, but I would shop some more based knowing what I know now.Edit: seller has reached out to try to resolve this so adding back one star for customer service",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to hold my 55\u201d Samsung TV.I weighed my TV and it\u2019s exactly 30 lb. Which is 65% of the advertised 46.3 lbs limit. This means I\u2019m 35% from max weight.If I\u2019m supposed to have 35% capacity, and this won\u2019t hold, it tells me the safety factor is over 1.0. Not good, this will likey fail and my TV would be destroyed.I bought this because I needed the articulatuon, extension, and 11 in vertical range. it holds the TV but only in the lowest range, the gas shocks cannot hold it in any position.I\u2019ve tightened the vertical (gas shock) adjustment to its tightest setting and it will not hold at any height other than dead bottom. At dead bottom the TV will not push back to the wall completely, it\u2019s sticking out about 8 inches from the wall. The other adjustments are made by \u201cjamb nuts\u201d and are not very good. You either set it to not move, or ot moves too freely. It\u2019s got more weight than it\u2019s designed for and moves more freely than it should.If you want this for a TV that\u2019s in the 30 lb range, DO NOT BUY; from my estimate it is only suited to a TV in the 20 (+\\~ 2) lb range. I installed this high in a 12 foot wall, takes a little more work. Now I have to redo this with another mount that is better made.I would not trust any advertising from this company.",

The positioning isn't as free as it allows you to believe. I found it a little tricky getting the screens in the positions I wanted. 2. Unless you have a big desk that allows alot of distance between you and the monitors you're either going to be with your face in the screen or a 6\" gap between your wall and desk. 3. It's pretty shaky/wobbly. Any little bump or movement makes the monitors shake. Fortunately I haven't notice it when I'm gaming, but it's there.Unless you're willing to shell out alot of money, I feel like you're rarely ever gonna get a perfect product, so for the price I feel 4 stars it fine.",
