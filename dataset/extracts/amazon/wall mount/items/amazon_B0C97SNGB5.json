I had to ask my son to help me mount my 55\" tv and the process, with his help, was not too painful. We both appreciated the 1-stud mount, the tv aligned perfectly with the VESA pattern, and he brought most of the muscle and used my tools. I like the screen flat against the wall but when I watch TV, I pull it away. It extends and tilts beautifully and I'm very happy with it. For ease of install alone (larger, heavy flatscreen=2 people + proper tools), I would highly recommend the DAWASAPAT tv wall mount.",

                "reviewText": "This TV wall mount is compatible with a wide range of TV sizes. It comes with extendable brackets for bigger TVs. Instructions are included and are pretty good. The instructions could be slightly improved by specifying the drill bit size needed for the dry wall anchors. Regarding those anchors, they didn't work for my old plaster walls. They are plastic and quickly broke when I attempted to tighten the screws while installing the anchor plate. Plan B: go to the hardware store and spend $8 on good quality anchors. Once I got the anchors installed, the rest was quick and easy. The mount comes with a cheap level - a nice bonus item to include. The design of the mount allows you to adjust the level with the bottom wall screw in the slot. Another good feature is that the viewing angle can be adjusted as well. I would give this 5 stars except for the anchors. It's a minor gripe. I'd rate 4.5 starts if I could.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little sceptical given the compact size of this mount, but it is incredibly strong.I mounted it to a stud in the wall, and hung an older 55 inch LG flat screen that weighs about 60 lbs., and I think it could easily take more.The extend, retract, and tilt features are pretty nice. I keep the TV flat to the wall during the day, then pull it out when we go to bed.Comes with all the hardware you should need.Great value! Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "So my boyfriend & I are currently moving out of state. Hes already moved all of our stuff & is in our new home but certain circumstances prevent me from being able to join him until November. Normally we have a 60in on our wall but I wanted him to take all of our big things & get setup already, leaving me with a much smaller 32in. I had it on a small entertainment center shelf & it just sits too low to the ground so I needed to find a mount to get my tv on to the wall, preferrably one that wasn't super expensive. This one states that it would work for a 14in tv all the way to a 60in tv, which doesn't quite seem right but since my TV is on the smaller end of that, I figured I would be ok. It was simple enough to install using just hand tools, however I did need to borrow a male friend because as a 110lbs female, I just didn't have the strength to get the bolts into the stud & I don't trust using anchors in the drywall, not just with this mount but with anything. I don't want to chance my TV ever falling down potentially on me, which would hurt but especially not on my kitten, which would undoutbedly kill her. Anyways, it took maybe 30min from start to finish to get it hung up on the wall. I will say I can tell a cheaper mount as its not made of the same super heavy super thick metal as my other ones are but its still sturdy. Its a little difficult to move/change positions because the joints are kinda stiff & so it requires some force... I know I could loosen up the bolts & it might fix this but I would not feel that is a safe option. Maybe a little wd-40 could work as a safer option but I don't have any on hand at the moment so I can't say for sure. I will get some to try it out & update this review with the results when I do. Even though its stiff, I feel like the metal can handle the force to move it around... but I can't say that I would feel the same way if I had my 60in on it. I fear the metal is too thin & could buckle so I would definitely not put my 60inch on it even though it says I could. Its for that reason I took a star off. So if you have a smaller, lighter TV that you want mounted on the wall & you want to be able to move the direction it faces at times, then I would recommend this. Just know you do need at the very least need a level (a smalll plastic magnetic one is included with it), & then a screwdriver & a wrench (both of which it does not come with). If your TV is larger or weighs a little more, then this is not the mount you want.",

The 3 screws they sent with the mount are insanely cheap and SNAPPED in the same place on all 3 screws when we put the TV on the mount - the bottom part of the screws are stuck in our wall now. We were able to go to home depot and get better screws and now it's solid and the mount works fine. The company should reimburse me and stop sending out low-quality hardware. Supposedly this mount goes up to a 60-inch TV, but there is NO WAY I'd put that big of a TV on it even with my upgraded hardware. Ours is a 40 inch.",
