                "reviewText": "I wrote a similar review for the smaller version of this product.https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R344LERTN6OK5T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B8YZ5TR4Overall, this is a very good product. I had actually purchased to install one TV and ended up installing on a different one. The template that's included is very helpful along with the installation video. The instructions are really, including letting you know what additional tools will be needed. Be sure you have a good stud finder and good drill to get your pilot holes started. This might be where you spend a bit of your time.I also liked the recommended, \"stress / tension test\" the instructions have you perform before mounting your TV.The TV braces are designed well and make it easy to take the TV down if needed.Some Cons / areas that could be improved:1) Take extra care with the TV Braces as they have rough/sharp edges. As I learned the hard way by getting a nasty cut while making some adjustments.2) The spacers provided were of limited help. For this application, I didn't need them.3) This one is important. I'd recommend purchasing a separate installation hardware kit. The variety pack that this mounting kit ships with is nice but doesn't have everything. It didn't come with the size I needed. Fortunately, I had additional bolts from another hardware installation kit that were just the right fit.4) Lastly, this product ships with 4 good size Lag Screws that you use to secure the mount to the studs in your wall. For my application, these were too short and I need to purchase longer ones, for added support and safety. For this application, I do wish all the screws and bolts were stainless steel vs zinc plated.All-in-all it's not a bad product for the price.",
