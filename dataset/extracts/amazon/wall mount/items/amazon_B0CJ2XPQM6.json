                "reviewText": "I have purchased several TV mounts over the years and most of them from a box store. This one beats every single one of the others that I have ever purchased. The build quality is really good and the mount is really sturdy.It is fairly easy to install. I elected to use some shorter lag screws that I already had as the supplied ones are really long. The provided template was a huge time saver and it is made of a good material that is easy to align and press flat against the wall. I installed mine on a stud through our wood paneling and sheetrock.The kit comes with a few Velcro cable management straps and the mount itself has two cord hooks/loops to run your cables up and behind the TV. Alignment was pretty easy to do. I squared up the mount prior to installing it and the final alignment was just a slight tweaking. The provided level works well and is properly calibrated.The LED lights are really neat and they have a lot of settings for different effects. You can set them up to change with music, solid colors, flashing, running colors... etc. A power supply is included for the LED lights if your TV doesn't have a powered USB port.I used this mount to setup a PC based work/game center for my kids. It is setup in the living room so we can watch what they are doing. The mini PC we used is also mounted on the TV mount on the backside. This TV mount has no problem holding the 40\" Vizio Smart TV and the mini PC. The swinging/rotating action of this mount is nice and smooth. I suspect it can hold quite a bit of weight, so this would be good for the larger TVs as well.Excellent quality, excellent buy.",

                "reviewText": "This thing was so easy to install i was surprised. I just marked the middle of the stud, measured the top hole up from it, and it was done. It has many height adjustments to even if you didn't get it at exactly the right height chances are the mounting arms will allow you to fix that. And with the 3 bar swing arm I can have it (almost) flat against the wall, pull it out very much closer to me if gaming and want to see better, or angle it to any specific seat if I am the only one watching. This mount is a super value and it holds my 65\" tv like its nothing. I do not worry, this thing isn't gonna go anywhere. It is super strong.",
