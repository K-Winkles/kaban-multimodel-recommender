                "reviewText": "I love it, it has great range of motion, and is well made. The mounting hardware is sufficient for 32 inch tv, and it comes with the VESA for 75x75, which fits my 32\" Toshiba tv. The directions are very poor, but if you look at their video, it helps make sense of them. Luckily, my tv has the right size screws listed for wall mounting, and that helped. There are 4 screw sizes for the VESA mount on the back of the TV. Mine happens to be the smallest in the package. The packaging is listed as A_B_C etc, and not as written in the instructions. I, a woman, was able to use my tools and install this in the wall, and then had hubs help with mounting the tv...otherwise, done by myself. I found it easy to do, and it is well made.",
