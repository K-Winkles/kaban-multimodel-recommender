                "reviewText": "It is a fantastic TV mount. Use it for front of treadmill.The mount is heavy-duty and very strong. Thus, the difficulty with mounting because it is heavy/awkward, the wall side mount does not remove so you have to hold up the entire mount while trying to keep it plumb and mark the holes correctly. This was quite difficult.Finally, once installed, could not get the arm to maneuver down. Had to use the online chat operator who did help clarify some things.The best position of the arm is where the TV and arm is level (not up or down). This way, you have room to adjust up and down afterwards. When the arm is positioned up (almost permanently), it is hard to estimate where that middle position is. So had to do a lot of thinking, planning and calculating.Once it was mounted to the wall and TV placed onto the mount, I could not get the arm to move down. Took a LONG time and many, many turns of the screw before the internal gas cylinder released, causing the TV to nearly fall down. Then, you re-tighten the screw gradually until you get the correct tension of the arms to hold the TV steady in position. Now, I simply love the mount, but installation by myself was quite difficulty. Instructions did not help much.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this monitor arm specifically for my (very large and heavy) Samsung Odyssey G9, a 49\" super ultra-wide curved monitor. The arm is able to support the weight of the monitor fine (after tightening up some of the screws as necessary) and it works great for me. I was having a lot of trouble finding a wall-mounted arm that would support this size/weight of monitor so am glad to find one that worked so well and at such a great price compared to competitors!Only issue is that the monitor has a very slight tilt to the right due to the weight of the monitor and the position of the arm. The tilt is very minor and doesn't bother me, but if you've got a similarly large/heavy monitor and are OCD or think that if the monitor isn't *perfectly* level then you might be better off looking elsewhere (unfortunately, that means either significantly higher cost, or a design with much less mobility).",

                "reviewText": "This mount replaces a previous one that really only provided side-to-side movement (and some tilt with difficulty). Folks could not understand that it did not raise and lower, so somebody pulled the mounting screws through the drywall drying to raise or lower the screen. We shopped around and similar models by other mfg got poor reviews from folks - particularly the pneumatic ones. This one is \"spring\" balanced and got fewer reviews about adjustment problems. Things that I am pleased about. 1) It was easy to install (really). 2) The counter balance adjustment is on top and always exposed. Some models got bad reviews because the adjustment was impossible to get to. 3) The tilt is smooth. Our old one was not this nice. 4) Once adjusted, it is easy to swing it side to side or move it up or down. My only concern was that my monitor may be too light for the spring balance (see the seller notes), but that was not a problem at all. We use it in a camp kitchen where some folks sit, others stand, and lots of people touch it through the day. Needless to say, nobody has jerked this one off the wall. I am a happy camper!",

                "reviewText": "I went off of a recommendation I saw on reddit. I mounted this to a dry wall stud, the mount was super secure in there. The mount extensions weren\u2019t necessarily for the visa mount. The attachment mechanism was very sound, it hooks onto 2 bolts via gravity and a third bolt under the mount to seal the deal.The gas pump is super strong, can easily hold huge TV\u2019s and it held the Odyssey G9 just fine, with it being around 33 lbs.One thing was the tilt sagging, that is normally an issue with mounts and I can say that the center of gravity for the monitor was a liiiitle too much for the tension on the tilt swivel for this mount. I tried tightening it, but it didn\u2019t seem to work that well. You can probably tighten it just perfectly, but in the end we just stuck a bolt through the hole where the tilt sags. And the monitor is now perfectly straight, and we can move it around.",
