                "reviewText": "Product Review: Studless Drywall TV Mount for 12-55 inch TVsI recently purchased the Studless Drywall TV Mount for my 42-inch LED TV, and I must say that I am extremely pleased with its performance. This TV wall bracket is designed specifically for drywall installations and provides a hassle-free and secure mounting solution for TVs ranging from 12 to 55 inches.One of the standout features of this TV mount is its studless design, which allows for easy installation on drywall without the need for finding and attaching to studs. This feature makes it incredibly convenient, especially if you're unsure of stud placement or if there are no studs available in your desired location. Despite the lack of studs, the mount feels rock solid and provides excellent stability for my TV.The versatility of this mount is also worth mentioning. It supports VESA patterns up to 400x400mm, making it compatible with a wide range of LED, LCD, plasma, flat, and curved screen TVs and monitors. The weight capacity of 100 lbs ensures that it can accommodate most TVs in the market without any concerns about stability or safety.Installing the mount was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions and the included hardware. The package came with all the necessary screws, bolts, and spacers, which made the process quick and straightforward. The mount itself has a low-profile design, which means my TV sits close to the wall and looks sleek and stylish.Once the TV was mounted, I was pleased to find that the mount allows for easy tilting and swiveling. This feature is great for achieving the perfect viewing angle.",

                "reviewText": "So cheap but so simple. I've always thought that most TV mounts were so overkill. They would make sense if I was mounting a few hundred pounds to the wall. I recognize that this is a cheap chinsy product, but it gets the job done. And, it mounts as close close/tight to the wall. As long as you don't mount a TV larger than advised, you should have no worries.Make sure you've slid the TV and the mount in properly. It's easy to mistakenly think they've overlapped when it's not.",

My daughter has a 65 inch tv and it was starting to make her dresser sag in the middle due to the weight. She wanted me to mount it on her wall but\u2026.I didn\u2019t want to go through all that. Then I found this and ordered it. The price was low enough. It came with a lot of different screw sizes to fit the back of the tv. I found ones to fit perfectly and literally took about 10 minutes start to finish. Super easy and needed 2 tools. It came with a level to help. I ended up ordering another for my other daughter\u2019s 65 inch tv. I would absolutely recommend getting this. I am not a handy man but this makes you feel like one when it\u2019s accomplished.",

I am thoroughly impressed. It holds my 32\u201d perfectly. I was extremely hesitant and nervous I was going to wake up in the middle of the night with my TV crashing down to the floor but it\u2019s been great! Each nail apparently holds 10 pounds and there\u2019s about 15-20 of them. Couldn\u2019t recommend enough. *Note: you can\u2019t turn your tv at all so if you don\u2019t mind that then this will be perfect for your needs.",
