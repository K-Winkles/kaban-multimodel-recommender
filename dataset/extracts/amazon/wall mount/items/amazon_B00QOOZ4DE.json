                "reviewText": "It is rare these days to find products of this high quality at a true value price! I was so impressed with the quality, ease of installation, and excellent strength and functionality of this product that I ordered another one to replace an existing (lesser quality) mount. From my experience with both purchases, The Mounting Dream company exemplifies excellent quality control demonstrated by both products being received in a sturdy product box, factory tape sealed. Instructions are thorough and easy. All necessary hardware is supplied including numerous spacers to answer almost any tolerance situation (were not even needed in my casde but very handy should one need them). The design of this mount is among the best imo as it allows lateral movement of the TV after installation for better centering on the wall if pulled away from the wall or angled in varioius positions. Adjusting angle and tilt is easy and secure. The installation is quite simple and an important tip is use the included level (or you own) to be sure everything is level. A convenient and helpful mounting template is included that makes installation even easier. The lag bolts are fine only I used slightly shorter/slightly larger diameter ones; but the ones included certainly suffice only I found it a bit easier to drive a slightly shorter one all the way into the stud using slightly shorter lag bolts; avoiding the chance of overstressing the head of the longer lag bolts included. Just pre drill the holes into the wall/stud. IMPORTANT-Definitely DO NOT use power drivers to power drive in the lag bolts as that could cause too much torque leading to bolt fracture. AS STATED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS, Install lag bolts only by using a manual hand tool and a ratchet and socket or socket driver work far better and easier than a Phillips screwdriver. to install lag bolts. This company is reputable based on the product quality and quality control measures taken in packaging. If you are looking for an excellent, easy to install, highly versatile and functional TV mount for a great price and appreciate excellent packaging, instructions, customer support contact info, etc., you found it with Mounting Dream. My guess is the other products Mounting Dream offer are comparable in terms of quality and value. Since often reviews can all to often be fake, please be assured that this review is my honest opinion based on experience from purchasing two units. I have not been contacted or offered anything for this review and would never partake in such activities which I feel have potential to only mislead the consumer. You can trust in this review as I rarely write reviews, but when a product comes along that is this satisfying and noteworthy, then I believe the product and company deserve noteworthy recognition. Hopefully more companies will follow suit with this level of all aroundbar setting quality.",

The instructions are clear, step by step and the product is packaged with all parts separately packaged to easily select what you need. The mount is solid quality, great flexibility to tilt and move into any position you need. Installation was a snap and I installed everything in 30 minutes by myself, including hanging the TV! The price is excellent and I've seen mounts not nearly this quality for double the cost or more!!",

                "reviewText": "Needed an articulated wall mount for a 43\" TV. Looked at a bunch and dismissed them due to either price, design or what appeared to be cheap quality materials. This one checked all the boxes for a TV of that size: single stud mount, big range of motion, extended quite a way from the wall, and, according to other reviewers, quality materials/construction and easy installation.It delivered on every one of those things, including the fact that the design of the part that mounts to the wall, the way the arm folds, and the template provided made it one of the easiest wall mount installs I've done (which is something like 6-8 now). And the adjustment options for tilt, etc are basic but well-designed.Would have given it 4.5 stars if I could but a couple small \"cons\":- Explanation of which screws/hardware to use on the back of the TV (to attach the mounting brackets) was a little lacking. I'd done this before, but if I had no experience, I could see where the instructions would have seemed lacking at that point.- Instructions around Step 2 could have been more clear. Didn't bother me, but if someone wasn't familiar with this stuff they might have had to read things a few times about drywall vs. concrete wall install info.- The unit was very stiff when trying to move it. I fixed this by slightly - and I very slightly - loosening the nuts on the bolts (at the points where the articulated arm bends). Definitely wouldn't want to over-loosen those for a couple reasons, but it was so stiff out of the box that it would have been pretty difficult to move the arm around when everything was mounted.",

At work, we just leave the part screwed to the back of our tvs, leave the wall portion in the room, and use it at the next station we move to each year. The posterboard guide made drilling the holes super easy, and I kind of did it without reading the instructions. (I did go back afterwards to verify I did it right to avoid it crashing down later)I like that I have a 50\" tv at work and it can come out far enough to easily connect/disconnect cables from it with ease. It has bolts that screw in to prevent it sliding/lifting off the mount accidentally and plenty of adjustment screws to give you the viewing angle you want.Just a solid mount.",

                "reviewText": "This mount arrived on time just after the Easter holidays. It was well packed, with every conceivable screw and fitting for a wide range of TVs. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. It even included a sprit level to ensure correct installation. I am typically very cautious and slow with the installation of new equipment, but the installation went very easily and took less than 30 minutes, It was not difficult to achieve a secure mounting to the wall stud. I was a little concerned that the mount would not be strong enough, with 3 screws in line on a single stud, to provide a secure installation when I swivelled the TV off centre, but I need not had worried - this is a very solid installation.I was very impressed with the high quality of the mount. My TV, a 49 inch Toshiba, was very easy for me to fit, singlehanded, onto the mount, which provides an angular adjustment to correct for any vertical misalignment of the mounting plate on the stud up to 3 degrees. I didn\u2019t need this because it was not difficult to mount the bracket so that it was vertical. The TV can be moved along the mounting rail to enable it to be positioned at right angles to the wall when it is pulled to maximum extension. Rotating the TV on the bracket is easy, and the swivel arm is very solid and strong.Before I bought this mount I looked at several others. I was swayed into selecting this unit by the huge number of 5 and 4 star reviews. Having bought and installed it I find myself joining the 5 star group. I think the high quality and low price make this mount a real bargain and would have no hesitation in buying another.",
