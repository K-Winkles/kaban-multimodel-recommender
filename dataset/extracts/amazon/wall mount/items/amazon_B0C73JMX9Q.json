                "reviewText": "It is a bse mounting bracket to hang even large TV on a wall. Nothing more. Small rage tilt adjustment, no any rotating adjustment, but this what I need. Hanging TV for straight viewing angle. It is sturdy, I used my own tools to install so can't atest to quality of that short water level.5 star rating is within the basic mounts category. This does not measure up to full adjustment range mounts.",

                "reviewText": "I picked this mount out, because of it's ability to tilt. I had a TeeVee given to me, and it had 1/2 the wall bracket on it, and no stand. Fortunately I was able to mount it (temp fix, not long term), and I loved the fact that it tilts. So when I was looking for a proper wall bracket for my 42\" TeeVee, that would tilt, this bracket jumped out at me from the list. I'm really impressed with the fact that included nearly all the hardware I could need to mount almost anything, and I was able to easily get the base mounted to the wall without issue. You should be able to easily hit any stud spacing you may have in your location, to mount this bracket. I'm happy with this tilting wall bracket, and can recommend it.",
