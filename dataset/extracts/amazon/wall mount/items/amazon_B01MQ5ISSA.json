Included hardware for mounting on drywall with wood stud behind it or solid wall, maybe meant to be concrete? Instructions are pictures only with no words to explain what's what, but it does have some letters that reference the hardware components. It doesn't explain that you should unscrew the rail screws almost to the end before starting, which I figured out by laying out the parts to see how it works. One mounts the rectangular part to the wall and rails to the TV. Then hang the TV on the wall frame and tighten the screws from below.",

                "reviewText": "Amazon used the information provided by the manufacturer, which unfortunately was incorrect. The series of mounts is good for up to 600x400 MM VESA standard mounting pattern, but the part #116091 only spans to 400x400 MM, so I had to return this item and re-order the 116092 version, which according to the installation \"instructions\" is good for 600x600 MM. Construction wise the mount seemed OK for a basic unit. I will post another review when I get the correctly sized model and put it to use. There was a review on the Monoprice site from May 2017 noting the same incorrect information that I did not see prior to ordering from Amazon. Email sent to Monoprice tech support, will see if it gets corrected.",

You may need some 90 degree adaptors so that you do not put too much pressure on the connections on the rear (unless they are down facing connections).",
