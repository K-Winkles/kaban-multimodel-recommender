                "reviewText": "Very good mount and easy to use. Be aware that this mount is only 16\" wide! If you are trying to center the mount on a wall you will need to locate your studs to make sure you have 2 studs to screw into or 1 stud near the center of the mount for support. If your studs are not centered where you need them, you should look for a mount that will span 24\" in order to accommodate stud location so you can keep your TV centered. Just FYI. This appears to be a very good mount. It is holding our 85\" TV nicely.",

                "reviewText": "I recently installed the Pipishell Full Motion TV Wall Mount for my 85-inch flat-screen TV, and it's fair to say that the product has both its high points and areas that could use improvement. The mount is quite sturdy and holds up well, which is paramount when it comes to the safety and security of large, expensive TVs. The swivel dual articulating arms and the tool-free tilt feature are excellent additions, offering a range of motion and viewing angles that elevate the overall TV-watching experience.However, a word of caution to potential buyers about the backing plate size. The mount comes with a 16-inch backing plate, which was a bit of a letdown for my specific installation needs. I was aiming to have my TV centered between studs and ideally needed a 32-inch backing plate for that perfect alignment. Despite this, I was able to make it work, but it's something I wish I had known beforehand. So, if you're considering this mount, take the time to measure the distance between your studs to ensure that the backing plate will suit your setup.On a positive note, the mount does come with a very helpful template, which aids in getting the installation just right. The inclusion of this template is a thoughtful touch, simplifying the mounting process and helping to achieve precise drilling and alignment.In conclusion, while the Pipishell Full Motion TV Wall Mount is well-built and provides a robust and flexible mounting solution, the backing plate size could be a limitation depending on your wall stud configuration. It's crucial to measure and plan accordingly before purchasing. If the backing plate fits your space, you'll likely be pleased with the durable build and the functional, user-friendly design of this TV mount.",

But if you do have the right tools it goes into the wood studs like butter. This is a 75\" Tv so I needed another person to help mount but once leveled was great",
