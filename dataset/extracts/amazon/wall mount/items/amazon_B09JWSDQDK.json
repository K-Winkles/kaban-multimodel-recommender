Cost 1/4 the price of inferior mounts at the local tech chain store and got it next day delivery. I suppose the TV could be a little tighter to the wall but I might just have a low end bulky thick TV. The range of motion is limited by design (just up and down) and installation involving cranking big bolts into wall studs is not trivial, but that's life.",
