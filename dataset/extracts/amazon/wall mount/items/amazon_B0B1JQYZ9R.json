If you are using it in a corner, the amount of reach and the width of your TV will determine if you can use it or not. Very sturdy mount, but unfortunately our TV was too wide and we returned it.",

                "reviewText": "As I said in the title, if you're going to install this by yourself, have the holes pre-drilled. I thought I would be clever by removing the wall mounts and affixing them to the wall ahead of time. My thinking was I wouldn't be wrestling the swing arms with one hand, and trying to operate a power driver with the other. The process of re-attaching the arms to mounts while making sure the teflon washers didn't fall out ended up being the worse option.Hindsight being 20/20 I would have traced out a cardboard template of the mounts and saved myself a lot of awkward maneuvering.Once installed it performs beautifully.",
