The mount has a number of options and It was difficult for me to figure out which option I needed to use. I have a tendency to skip a few of the instructions if I think I have it figured out what to do. That method did not work here. When I read all the instructions and figured out why I was doing this step everything got much easier. Double and triple check all measurements.",

The holes are 8x20 inches, so a very hard fit with most mounts. Second, the studs were 24 inches apart. This mount solved both of those problems! I went to the box stores and the mounts with these features were $300+, and really designed for very large TVs. This one was much more affordable, especially for an older TV that probably doesn't have much life left. This mount met all my expectations, so I am very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "I tried 2 others that didn't work out because the wall space I was working with was just the right size for the TV, but the stud was not dead center in that space. And most TV mounts that can handle that are flat against the walls one, I wanted one with some articulation.This one worked perfectly. It's a bit overkill for my TV ( it's a 50' Roku and only weighs like 50 pounds) but what it does have is you can put an extender on both sides to use it with 24' stud distances.I put one extender on and then mounted it so that the TV was dead center in the wall, it worked perfectly. I can tilt it to face more one side of the room which is great too (it can do more than that, it can extend out like a foot or so, etc).my only complaint is when you clse it as flush as possible to the wall it seems to do a bit of a jerk right at the end, like the TV is kind of shifting on the mounting bracket holders. But it's a really smal thing to complain about.My other complaint is it is quite a bit of work to setup and install. Not hard, just quite a few steps and a lot of fiddly measuring to get it exactly right. I also wonder if it settles an inch or two after you complete the install, like the weight of the TV pulls down a few inches, because I KNOW I measured it to be precisely where I wanted it to be and once done the top of the TV comes to about 3 inches lower than it should be according to measurement.Other than that, love it.",
