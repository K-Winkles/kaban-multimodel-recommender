I can also tilt the TV up or down to reduce glare.The mount was easy to install. The instructions were clear and concise, and all of the necessary hardware was included. I was able to get the mount installed in about 30 minutes.I've been using the mount for a few months now and I'm very happy with it. It's a great way to save space and get the most out of my TV.",

                "reviewText": "The concept was exceptional, the directions great, finished product okay. Part of the bracket moved really loosely and my son still thinks it's broken. There were not enough screws for the bracket and holding up a 50-inch TV, and to me, that's a big job as I am the one who will have to pay for a new one. Also, due to the construction of our home, it could not be put up the way the bracket was made so it is being held by 3 screws mainly as there was only one side that lined up with a stud. The other three were put up with mollies and I don't know how sturdy those are. Thank goodness the TV isn't really heavy.",
