The ability to tilt edges out and move the TV back and forth to get at the cabling behind it is great.Also, what is really cool, if you go to Sanus' website, you can put in the model of TV, desired height, and get handy measurements for putting up the template.I think all this together meant our bracket went up in ~20 minutes, and the TV in another 5 minutes.Overall, I would buy this again for any TV large enough to use it.",

I have a bum shoulder from recent surgery so I rigged up a jack to do the bulk of lifting. This is a good idea. Big TVs are still heavy.THe positive CLICK of the bracket when you get it properly in place is a big plus, because you won't be able to see well. The tilting is a bonus even if you will have it flat against the wall to watch TV because you can hang the heavy sucker THEN tilt it and hook up the wiring. This is a big big plus.Hardware that came with it was good. Template was handy. Instructions were clear. It's a good, stronk mount like even mother in law could hang off it. I like my mother in law and she's tiny but this is a joke people. Merry new year.",

                "reviewText": "Bought to mount an old 2007 40\" Sony TV (flatscreen, but heavier than modern 40\"). I had never installed a wall mount before, so went slow and measured umpteen times, but the template worked smoothly. You will need a stud finder and I recommend a powered drill. It did install smoothly for me and has held very securely for two months now. A lot of mounting component options for different TV model needs; I am happy to store those for when I am able to get a newer TV. The viewing angles are quite good. It does pull a little ways out from the wall and tips to each side (up, down, right, left) so I can view comfortable across several angles (including diagonally from my kitchen). It is also fairly easy to adjust placement if you need it set a little to one side or the other on the mount bracket. The tension knob is easy to use, which was necessary to keep my old heavyweight from drooping forward unexpectedly. Low-profile visual presence on the wall, though that would depend on the size of the TV being mounted; clean even lines with minimal fuss. Note there is not a lot of clearance between the TV and the wall if you do not keep the TV extended, so if your TV is older like mine with ports facing straight to the back instead of out to the side of the screen, you may need to buy angled adapters for HDMI attachments (e,g, Amazon Fire Stick) or stiff cables.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this to mount a 75\" TV at about 110 lbs. I wanted a bracket that would tilt enough to provide access to the back of the TV. It is wide enough to anchor into 2 wall studs. The left and right ends of the TV can be pivoted out to allow access to the power and AV cables. The top edge of the TV can tilt forward or lay flat against the wall. The unit offers minor level adjustments after the bracket is mounted to the wall. Overall, I am very pleased with this TV mount.",

The packaging contains all the necessary hardware you need to mount it minus the power tools and stud finder.However, it's not as low profile as you'll think. They mentioned that the mount will place your TV only 2.1 inch away from the wall. What was not mentioned is that the 2.1 inch is to the back of your TV from the wall. This is where your TV meets the mount. The Real gap will be 2.1 plus whatever the thickness of your TV is.Other than that, the mount is great and worth the money.",
