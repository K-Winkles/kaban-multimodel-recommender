                "reviewText": "This product was easy to install. No issues with it. I don\u2019t really like how the string dangles, so just wrap them up too and that takes care of that aestheticallly. I wish is tilted a little bit more but I knew it was only a 10 degree tilt as advertised. I used it for our guest room tv. It\u2019s a smaller room and the wall that it\u2019s mounted on is a small pathway\u2026 so I wanted the tv hung up at least 6feet high so people won\u2019t bump their heads. It\u2019s close to our ceiling now which is why I wish it tilted more. So if you\u2019re going to be hanging your tv over 6 ft high\u2026 get one with a bigger tilt angle. But if not, then this one is a great value!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought four of these mounts to use throughout my house. I didn\u2019t need anything fancy so I chose to stay simple and get these. I was so pleased with these mounts. They fit all the tvs I had and were so easy to install. They\u2019re strong and sturdy and I love that they each came with their own level. They sit very flush to the wall or lean down just enough to see when they\u2019re mounted a little high which is great since my kids beds are close to the floor so they can still see the tv when laying in bed. Highly recommend this for sure",
