The pieces included were all useful and organized well.The wall hanging portion seemed to be pretty bent almost at a slant from the manufacturer so I had to bend it slightly and angle the hang a bit more to one direction. Other than that pretty solid buy especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Mounting to the wall is fairly easy with this TV mount. The issue is that it\u2019s aesthetically, Ridiculous! Why would we want straps hanging inches below the TV? In the picture, you can see that I had tried to tape the straps behind the TV. After a few days, they eventually fall.Who thought this would be a good idea? once the TV is hung, there\u2019s no need for the straps anyway. They cannot be used to till the TV once the TV has been installed so I don\u2019t get why the straps are there at all.I stuck a command hook behind the TV thinking I could get both straps to hang on it to hide them, but and it\u2019s impossible because you can\u2019t reach your fingers/hand behind the TV to get them on the hook after the TV has been hung.Spend the extra money and get a different mount that doesn\u2019t have the straps!!",
