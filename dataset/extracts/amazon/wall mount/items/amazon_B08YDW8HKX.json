                "reviewText": "Super easy to install!BTW I rarely leave reviews...unless I am super disappointed or impressed, this product definitely falls into the IMPRESSED category, it's just right to let people know one way or the other!Anything you need is included in the box for a modern flat-screen TV.I did this install all by myself and I am NOT a DIYer and typically hesitant!Instructions were easy to follow. I maybe spent 20 minutes on this and the majority of that was me measuring for proper placement for the area.My TV was smaller (43\"), if you have a larger TV you might want assistance just to be safe...the larger the TV the more awkward it might be to hang...but you can do all the prep by yourself and then just call a friend for a quick hand to hang.It is seriously unbelievable how sturdy it is! My TV was an LG 43\", just purchased at Costco so all the VESA standards applied to the installation....I am just amazed, great price too!I am returning my wall mount purchased from Costco that would have caused so much damage to the wall and 5X the price. I am currently renting...but with this mounting system I used only 5 small nails...probably overkill because the TV is only 19 lbs and they recommend one nail per 10 lbs so my property manager will be thrilled. I didn't peel off the sticky tape either...figured that would cause unnecessary damage when I uninstall.The only reason this product should receive a bad review is because someone didn't follow instructions...it is seriously a top-notch product! My walls are drywall...wondering if older plaster might be a tougher install, but dry wall install was fab!The level included is ingenious!Thanks to the engineers who designed this!",

                "reviewText": "This is so simple to install. Seems very secure. One issue I ran into is the power cord for my TV. Because the power jack is on the back of the TV when I hung it, the TV didn't hang properly. The mount was flush but the cord placement caused the TV to hang part flush, part pushed out from the wall. I added spacers for the back bracket to allow the space for the cord and problem was solved. You may want to keep this is mind when mounting your TV.",

The power and coaxial plugs stick out backwards for my TV so the TV is propped upwards. Probably not good that the cords are being pushed into the TV. Functionally It's already mounted higher being above the fireplace so it's awkward that it is tilted toward the ceiling instead of the floor.",

                "reviewText": "This is as easy as you can get with wall mounting a TV. The package is small yet contains bolts for pretty much any VESA configuration. You only have to connect to the top 2 VESA holes on your TV.This package is pretty much \"dummy proof\". The instructions are simplistic and it includes a small level to make sure that you get everything straight.Do note that if your TV has connectors that plug directly into the back of it you may need to buy right angle adapters to prevent them from causing your TV to bulge out.At the price I paid ($12.50) this is incredible value.",

When they moved out and took it down, there was no damage left to the wall. This uses small finishing nails, which leaves hardly a trace on the wall.Needless to say, I ordered mine and hung the TV in my room. It was easy to set up and it feels very securely attached to the wall.I highly recommend it. Especially if you live in an apartment and are worried about getting charged for damage to the wall.",

It feels super sturdy against my wall and was extremely happy it came with the small leveler to put in the bracket while I was installing it. It took me a bit to get around to installing it because I was worried without a 2nd pair of eyes it may not be centered/straight, but this helped a lot since I didn't own a leveler prior! Though my TV isn't too heavy, it seems pretty obvious it can hold much more weight. It comes with good quality nails and hardware, as well as a few different screw options to fit most TVs. There was only one pair of screws that fit the diameter needed for my TV, and they were too long. They didn't supply enough of the small washers to get it to fit properly, and the screw just falls through the big washers they send. I had to find more of the small washers laying around to get it to work, but we made it! I'd give it 4.9 stars just because they could have added as many small washers as they did big ones, but then again they could have not added any at all and had the buyer find what screws would work so I can't complain.",
