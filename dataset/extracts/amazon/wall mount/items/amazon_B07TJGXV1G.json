                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Span two 16 inch studs",
                "reviewText": "The wall plate is designed to span two studs. Unless you have 8 inch or lower stud spacing it can't be centered on a stud. For standard 16 in stud spacing, it must be centered between two studs (for wider stud spacing it doesn't work). If you are picky about the wall position of the TV and wanted it centered near a stud, buy a different wall mount. With 400mm wide VESA the TV must be centered within 0.75 in of the center of the wall plate. Narrower VESA gives you more range to mount the TV off center on the wall plate, up to 4.7 inches to either side for 200mm and 6.6 in for 100mm. But you might want up to 8 inches off center before a different pair of studs would work better and you can't get that much with this wall mount.The L and R marked on the vertical pieces are from your viewpoint as you attach them to the back of the monitor (not from the completed orientation looking at the front of the monitor). A pair of pictures in the instructions makes that clear. If you have 400mm wide VESA, you must get L vs. R correct or it won't work at all. Several of the bad reviews say it doesn't work with 400mm VESA, one of which (saying it was done by a professional installer) shows it not working and clearly shows the L vs R pieces are reversed. My photo of this product attached to the back of my 50 inch TV with 400mm wide VESA shows it working well with L, R pieces correct. It also works for 400mm high VESA, but I don't have a photo of that. For narrower VESA, I don't think it is important to get L vs. R correct (unless you need the full flexibility for off center positioning). My photo (top down view) of the verticals attached to my 32 inch monitor shows L vs. R intentionally backward, because I think that works a little better for this monitor's recessed 75mm VESA mount.If you have power or display cord sticking straight back (as you see in my photo of my 32 inch monitor) that may be a problem. The cords as shown do not work. The monitor mounts slightly too close to the wall. I had a spare right angle power cord and I bought a right angle DPMI adapter, that would fix this problem. But for other reasons, I wanted this monitor an inch further from the wall and kludged standoffs between the monitor and the vertical pieces. For most monitors, the provided standoffs (much less than an inch) might add just enough for rear facing cords to work. But for most monitors you would need to buy longer screws for the standoffs to work. (Of course most TVs don't have this issue at all because the plugs are built sideways and only need standoffs if the back is curved). The provided standoffs don't work at all with the strange recessed 75mm VESA of my monitor.If you have a monitor smaller than 32 in, or you have 75mm high VESA mount, the vertical pieces will protrude as seen in the photo of the top of my 32 in monitor (75mm VESA). I wouldn't mind that because it is part of a bank of monitors that hide each other's mounting. But for a normal TV, this is likely a bad choice of wall mount for under 32 in and/or 75mm VESA. For 100mm to 300mm VESA on a 32 in or bigger TV there is enough flexibility in how you attach the verticals to the TV to hide them. For 400mm VESA, the verticals couldn't protrude even if you wanted them to.The wall mount screws look like you could use either philips or 10mm hex drive to tighten them. But, as mentioned in a few of the bad reviews, the screws are not high enough quality for the philips to work. The head will strip. The screws are plenty for holding a 50Lb TV on the wall (I'm not sure about the 99Lbs advertised). But you should use a 10mm hex drive, not a philips screw driver. Having put up a large number of similar devices, I would always use hex drive anyway (buying different screws if the ones provided were not hex drive). If you don't have a good stud finder and a ratchet set including 10mm, maybe this is not a product for you. (You still use a philips screw driver to attach the vertical pieces to the TV).",
