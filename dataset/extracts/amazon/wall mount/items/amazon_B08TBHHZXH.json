                "reviewText": "Came with a guide to hang it and various screw lengths (although one was different from the rest, thank god I didn't need that size!). I'd make sure all of the correct parts and hardware is there before beginning, as that's been a big issue according to reviews I saw before purchasing, but I'm glad I did! I have a VERY expensive TV, and I'm glad I can trust this mount to hold it up. Very strong, swivel is great and extention is great too. I'd recommend not making the extention arms straighten completely out though, like i tried on day 1: the tilt on the tv loosened and my beloved tv fell forward, but caught safely, and nothing like that has happened like that again. Great mount!",
