                "reviewText": "Fantastic experience at a very reasonable price. I bought this along with a ASUS monitor. The monitor did not come with an HDMI cable, which is the only way to connect it to my laptop. It also did not come with VESA mounting screws.Well, this mount came with:1. Very sturdy, high-quality mount that was easy to install and is more than strong enough to hold my 23\" monitor. Moves and tilts smoothly. Came with comprehensive and clear English-as-first-language instructions as well as needed hardware.2. Very nice blue and grey level to make it easy to mount level and will be useful in the toolbox as well.3. Screws to attach the monitor to the mount (should IMO have come with monitor but did not)4. Very stylish HDMI cable, 10' long, blue and black, which looks like a climbing rope and is very sturdy (my monitor also did not come with an HDMI cable). Without this I wouldn't be using my monitor right now.5. High quality black microfiber cloth to wipe off the fingerprints I put on my new monitor while mounting it.6. Very nicely built, bright LED keychain light. Not cheap crap that will give out in a week, but one I'm actually going to use.7. Three nice, soft, secure wrap-around cable \"ties\" - velcro type but nicer.This is one of those rare \"above and beyond\" products. Not only was the core item I bought functional, high quality, and easy to use, the makers anticipated every problem I might have right down to fingerprints on the monitor and took care of it for me - then threw in a useful free gift on top of it all. Oh, and the mount itself was VERY reasonably priced.I will buy all future mounts from this company, and just ordered a longer version of the HDMI cable that came with it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great bang for the buck. But please read on for a SERIOUS WARNING!",
                "reviewText": "Great bang for the buck. Very solid mount. The only part I am not totally pleased with is that there is a little play in the part where the ball mounts to the piece that you bolt to the arm. The play is in the direction of rotation in either direction. It makes it a little more challenging to level the top of the monitor, and if bumped it will shake a bit.This leads me to the main reason I wrote this review. I think there should be a very bold warning to make sure that the center screw in the piece that connects to the monitor is tight. This is the screw that is not accessible once the monitor is attached. It secures the monitor mount to the metal piece that connects to the arm. I did not even think to check it, it didn't stand out to me at all. Then when I mounted the monitor to the arm, it seemed very wobbly and unstable. I could not understand how it could be so sketchy. So I went back and looked at pictures of the mount, and saw the center screw, which I realized must be for holding the ball to the metal piece that mounts to the arm. I unscrewed the mount from the monitor, and found center screw was very loose. I feel like I am very lucky that the monitor did not come crashing down. After tightening it up and remounting the monitor, it is much more stable, but still has the bit of play I mentioned above.I am planning on writing the seller to find out if that bit of play is normal, or if maybe there was some wear from the movement up until the screw was tightened, or maybe I just got a sub-par part. I'm also considering taking it back apart, and adding some loctite to the threads. It is such a crucial mounting point, I'd hate to risk it coming loose.It is sketchy that it shipped this way. The screw should have been tight, or left out altogether. Please be warned, and check yours before mounting. You might even want to disconnect the monitor and check it even if already mounted, just to be safe.EDIT: The seller was very helpful, and sent out a new unit. The new unit does not have the same issue, everything is perfect. I am very pleased with both the mount and the seller. The price to quality ratio easily earns this product 5 stars, but I am going to leave it at 4 because of the initial experience (based on the unit I received, not the seller...seller is A+).",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I've increased the star rating of this product from 4/5 to 5/5 for the simple fact that SPN Performance (the seller of this product) has fantastic customer service. While my review was mostly positive (you can read it below, I have not changed it), I did note an issue with how tight the bolts came from the factory. SPN not only emailed me, but called me, to discuss the problem in depth and to let me know that they will be passing this information on to their manufacture to try and correct the problem in the future. The gentleman I spoke to from SPN was very professional and genuinely interested in the performance of his product. You cannot say that for many companies out there. Good on SPN for having great customer service.These mounts are pretty good, not great, but good. They will most certainly get the job done. What I really liked about them is how solid they feel. No flimsy parts. You will feel secure when you hang these.What I did not like is how difficult it was to get the monitor bracket off. They tightened the bolt way too tight. I needed to get a socket wrench and a piece of cloth for my hands (to prevent the allen wrench from digging in to my hand) in order to take it off. Also, the mount is not as flush against the wall as it could be.What I really liked about the mount is everything that it came with. Cheetah packed its box with more then they needed to. They include a level, HDMI cable, Velcro cable ties, and a little LED flash light.Lastly, if you cannot mount this in studs, make sure to get some real nice hollow wall anchors. The stuff included is really only for stud mounting.",

                "reviewText": "Ho preso la staffa da parete per metterci il mio monitor per computer fisso da 24 pollici. La staffa ha svolto il suo ruolo senza problemi e sar\u00e0 sicuramente utilissima a chi non pu\u00f2 o non vuole posizionare il proprio monitor o la propria tv sulla scrivania o sul piano di lavoro. La staffa, completamente in acciaio, \u00e8 solida e ha dimostrato, dopo oltre un anno di utilizzo, resistenza e affidabilit\u00e0. Nella confezione sono presenti due utili accessori: un cavo HDMI di tre metri di discreta qualit\u00e0 ed un utile livella a bolla per montare perfettamente dritta la staffa. Sono inoltre presenti delle pratiche fascette di plastica e di velcro per tenere fermi i fili al braccio della staffa ed evitare cos\u00ec cavi penzolanti ed un portachiavi dotato di luce. Nella confezione sono anche presenti i fischer e tutte le relative viti per fissare la staffa al muro e il monitor alla staffa; tutto molto comodo. Esteticamente la staffa presenta una linea abbastanza spartana (anche se dovrebbe essere completamente nascosta dal monitor) ed \u00e8 verniciata di nero. La piastra sulla quale si montano le viti per tenere bloccato il monitor ha due serie da quattro fori (in tutto otto) dalle misure standardizzate che si adattano per il corretto montaggio a seconda della grandezza del monitor; grazie a questo artificio la staffa \u00e8 praticamente compatibile con la stragrande maggioranza di monitor e tv che vanno dai 12 ai 24 pollici. Il montaggio della staffa \u00e8 abbastanza semplice anche se richiede un minimo di manualit\u00e0 e l\u2019uso di alcuni strumenti (come ad esempio il trapano per poter fissare i fischer all\u2019interno del muro e il cacciavite per bloccare il monitor alla staffa). La staffa, e lunga cm 6,5 (retratta), ma si estende fino a cm 38 e, attraverso due cerniere permette il movimento orizzontale (di 15 gradi) del braccio e del monitor. Non sono presenti movimenti verticali. La staffa ha un buon e attrito; potrete spostarla (e quindi spostare il monitor) senza troppa fatica ma una volta posizionata star\u00e0 ferma e non si muover\u00e0 accidentalmente. La staffa presenta le seguenti dimensioni: 15,2 x 22,9 x 5,1 cm e pesa circa 1,5 chilogrammi. Il prodotto \u00e8 arrivato, ben confezionato, nei tempi comunicati all\u2019atto della prenotazione. Il costo \u00e8 equo e in linea con le staffe dalla caratteristiche simili attualmente presenti sul mercato. Assegno cinque stelle a questa staffa e lo consiglio a tuti coloro che necessitano di una stampa solida e affidabile per il proprio monitor o tv.Spero di esservi stato utile!PRO:(+) Staffa (reclinabile di 15 gradi in due punti) solida e affidabile(+) Prodotto confezionato con cura: nella confezione \u00e8 presente tutto il materiale per poter, fin da subito, fissare la staffa al muro oltre che un utile cavo HDMI di tre metri e una livella a bolla per un corretto e preciso montaggio(+) Prezzo equoCONTRO:(-) Esteticamente migliorabileSe la recensione ti \u00e8 stata in qualche modo utile clicca \u201cSI\u201d qui sotto",

This one was priced well and VERY well designed. It even came with a HDMI cable, which blew my mind. Now the price has gone up a lot. It's now $52.45 after shipping cost and before taxes. It's likely still a better value than most mainstream mounts out there and it's still the best design I've seen in this price bracket, but there may be some other mounts now that are beating this in price, so I suggest doing the research. This mount is good quality.",

Die Holzschrauben waren nat\u00fcrlich nicht dabei, das w\u00e4re auch etwas viel verlangt. Die VESA L\u00f6cher passen bei meinem Monitor punktgenau, die Schrauben auch.Der Arm ist in der Benutzung sehr stabil und h\u00e4lt meinen Monitor ohne das kleinste Wackeln. Er l\u00e4st sich dadurch sehr exakt positionieren (und sogar Pivot ist dabei). Ich habe das Gef\u00fchl das der Arm auch noch deutlich mehr Gewicht sehr gut halten k\u00f6nnte.Seit kurzen habe ich sogar das HDMI-Kabel in Benutzung (PS3) und es funktioniert einwandfrei.Alles in allem ein super Paket mit guten Komponenten zu einem mehr als guten Preis.",

                "reviewText": "I had a good look around before I decided to go with this arm mount and to be honest I couldn't be happier! The arm has a nice finish to it, and it looks (and feels) solid enough.I had no problems mounting it on the wall with the fixings that came free with the arm, the instructions were clear and concise. I loosened all the movable joints slightly as they were a little stiff to begin with but are now great, I can move my monitor with very little force and the arm still holds it in position with no sag at all even at full extension. My monitor is doesn't weigh much (2.5 kg) so those with heavy equipment may have to keep the joint stiffer.I'm from Yorkshire so I like free stuff! I haven't used the free HDMI cable but the end connectors look very well made and the cable outer has a nice pattern on it. The other freebie is the spirit level, I wasn't sure how good this would be as it's small & plastic but I was pleasantly surprised as it was pretty accurate compared to my own metal spirit level, and I have actually used it since for another DIY job.Nothing really to dislike about the main product, only thing that I would like to see improved is the quality of finish on the wall mount bolts, the cast steel finish isn't the nicest look and it did make me question the strength of the bolts (something with a smooth matt / polished finish please), I used them anyway as they are more than strong enough for my 21.5\" (2.5 kg) monitor but I would have swapped them for others if I was mounting a large TV / monitor that was closer to the 15.8 kg max weight that the arm can take just for my own peace of mind.I thought about giving this 4 stars due to the bolts, but because of the overall high build quality, good range of movement, free spirit level and HDMI cable I decided to go with 5 stars, great bit of kit well done Cheetah! I would definitely recommend it to others!",
