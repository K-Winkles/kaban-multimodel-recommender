                "reviewText": "Just want to clarify my \"lower rating\" on the \"Range of Motion\", I put it low but must keep in mind, I purchased this TV mount knowing it was a \"Fixed TV Mount\", i.e., not expected to have motion.Okay, that said, the mount was very reasonably priced. Also, this mount was very accomodating to the width of my TV (55 inches), and more importanting, the mounting bracket was also wide enough to cover 16 inch wall studs such that I could put in 2 lag bolts into two studs, securing the mount very nicely. I had prior returned a mount that only covered a range of 12 inch studding.Something worth noting though, if your TV has hookup jacks in the back of the TV that you need access to, then you might want to get a mount that does have some motion, allowing you access to the hookups, as this mount is very closely fixed mounted to wall (within 2 inches).",
