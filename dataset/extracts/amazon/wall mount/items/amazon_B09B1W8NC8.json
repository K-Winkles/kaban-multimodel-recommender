It does not extend as far or swivel as much as the other one. I wish I had just gone with the version I had. I specifically wanted the same functionality, because the TV is in a corner of the room and it would be nice to be able to turn it more.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M92P11W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",
