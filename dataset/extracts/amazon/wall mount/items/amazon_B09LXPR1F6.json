                "reviewText": "Pros- Great price, which allowed me to spend money on other nice things like a really nice bar and plate set.- Feels solid, it does all the things I need it to do- It is a lot thinner than other racks even when folded out.- The sidebars have a nice numbering system on them (make sure to install there facing out).Cons- Instructions are trash. Like complete trash, not helpful at all. It took me like 5 hrs to figure it out, YouTubing similar racks helps, but still.- Parts are not label. There are some bolts that are just slightly longer, which are important, but since there are not labeled you won\u2019t realize this until you\u2019re into it.- It came damaged. Now normally I would say that isn\u2019t the company\u2019s fault, but in this case, they very poorly wrapped a 80lb hunk of metal for shipping. It was only wrapped in one layer of cardboard + tape, so of course it is going to get thrashed. In this, we also lost one of the caps that goes on top of the legs- Silver hardware. They would look SO much cooler if the hardware was powder coated black\u2026 I literally might spray paint the bolts.- the pull-up bar bows. I am only 140lbs and the pull-up bar has a slight bow when I use it. Completely usable and no worries if it breaking, but it is there.Neutrals- height of the rack. This rack is short, BUT it is the only rack I could find that fit under my garage door track, so a positive for me but probably a con for others. You cannot do pull ups, TTB, etc without bending your knees.- J-Hooks. They are Narrow, so there isn\u2019t a large margin for error when racking your bar, but they are plastic coated to protect your bar.Overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. I would rather spend $350 with some of these cons than $1,000\u2014 plus this was the only rack short enough for my garage",

                "reviewText": "Unit was delivered quickly and unlike other reviews, was packaged nicely. It arrived with no damage and all necessary components.Starting with the negative: the instructions are horrible. The various nuts and bolts aren\u2019t labeled at all so taking a full inventory and counting piece by piece to know which part is which is the only way to do this. The QR code provided in the \u201cinstruction manual\u201d takes you to an under construction page. Looking at the YouTube account for Signature Fitness gives you nothing related to this rack. I ended up watching a few videos of similar racks to get a general idea on the best way to install it.And some of the holes for the J hooks were too small. Had to round the holes out with a file to get the hooks in place.Pros: it\u2019s actually a really nice rack. Folds up quickly so my wife can still get in the garage when she wants to. Feels very sturdy when set up and working out.",

There was a QR code for instructions but the link is dead-as the rack folds in and out there is some friction caused by rotating on the threads of a bolt, would have been better to have a bushing. I plan on lubricating to help-no pin for locking the pull up bar, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s required to use but would have been good to include-j cups are a little shallow, haven\u2019t had any issue but was used to deeper onesOverall very happy with the rack, looking forward to adding some accessories and increasing its utility.",

                "reviewText": "The criticisms are valid. The instructions are garbage and the measurements mostly useless. Here\u2019s what you should do:1. Hold an upright bar to the wall. Look in the manual for the exact pegs that the bolts will go into on the back. Mark both sides on the wall. In my case I needed to move the bottom bracket up one rung to clear crown moulding. Drill and use your preferred screw type (I used normal style screws.) 2. Attach the bottom bracket by the left and right most top screws. Make sure it\u2019s level. Do the same for the top bracket. Don\u2019t tighten anything yet! 3. Attach the arms and upright posts. If one side does not fully touch the ground and the brackets are level then your surface isn\u2019t entirely level. (My garage floor was not.) Don\u2019t panic it is probably fine or you can order metal shims from Rogue!",

                "reviewText": "The rack itself is excellent. Solid and well built. Delivery was quick and no damage to the packaging or contents.The issue is with the company\u2019s quality control and customer service. Was missing a locking nut which was not a big deal because you can pick those up at any hardware store for a buck. However, also missing one of the swivel pins that lock the uprights into place - pretty important part for a folding wall rack. Completely unusable at this point.I\u2019ve emailed the company and submitted inquiries via the website numerous times without a response. For these reasons I had to deduct a couple of stars.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a folding rack for my small basement gym and this was the right choice. It\u2019s not too tall so it works well with my low ceilings. I\u2019m doing a Reno in the basement so I temporarily installed this unit until the gym is completed. Install was as expected, if you\u2019re good with your hands you\u2019ll have no problems. This rack can support heavy weights, it\u2019s heavy duty. I would have given a 5 but there were some small cosmetic imperfections (ex: numbers not punched out, paint defects, metal bends\u2026) but given the price I paid when the rack was on sale I\u2019m very happy with the purchase.",
