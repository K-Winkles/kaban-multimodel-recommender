Installation was easy (as long as you have a a drill and everything needed) and it feels super sturdy I pulled probably the equivalent of 30-40lbs on it and it felt like a rock! I like the flexibility of it, the extra cable guides on it and really for the price you couldn't beat it. Also I saw someone mention that you can't take the unit off the bracket, I don't know why they said that, you can easily unscrew it. Oh the one thing I'd recommend is when you're going to mount the bracket to the swing arm have someone help you it's just tricky to line it up and get it screwed on by yourself. Anyways a solid option that does a good job!",

                "reviewText": "I got this specifically for my echo show 15 and it works like a charm. I can swivel it to a more convenient spot while I watch cooking videos to follow along recipes when I'm in the kitchen then put it back into place when I am done. It has a small footprint when pushed all the way back about 2 inches from the wall so you don't have to worry about it sticking out too much. It only tilts about 15 degrees up or down so just make sure you install it in a spot where you will be able to see it at eye level and you should be good to go. It rotates a full 360 degrees in case you need to look at something in portrait or landscape.8/10 I would recommend it. I hope this review is helpful.",

It's just used for web browsing and some occasional streaming.It's not super heavy duty, but it doesn't need to be. Doesn't stick out far from the wall when it's pushed in, which is what I wanted.Price seems quite reasonable.",
