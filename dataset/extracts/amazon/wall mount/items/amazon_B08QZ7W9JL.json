                "reviewText": "very sturdy mount but the instructions are horrible (1 star). I do not understand why these Chinese companies do not employ an English-native to write the directions--or--purchase ONE item from IKEA and see how to do it right. Once I am done installing the item I can get over it but the poorly written directions cause me to spend 2-3 times the effort to accomplish a single task.Just ordered and installed my 3rd mount. The directions are like trying to do ROKU--you have to mix and match the diagrams which follow no known sequence. This is really easy to put up...the directions make it hard.I used some common sense and previous experience to mount the TV. Solid mount and it comes with all the screw and spacers for any tv.I wish there was a way to \"lock down\" the horizontal adjustment--this tips left-to-right very easily. For the price--this was worth it. But do NOT count on the instructions to mount it.",

The only negative i have is the wall mounting plate could be a bit longer - as it just makes it from one stud to the other. If you have a wall where the studs are not exactly 16 on center, it will not reach.",

Its pretty easy to install. you will need a drill and drill but plus a Philips head size 2 and there is an included wrench for adjustment.The main bonus I saw was the ability to adjust the tv left or right on the stand due to the long arms. it gave my 42 inch TV about 4 inches of movement on the wall left or right so 8 inches or to total movement on the wall. A larger TV or rather more spaced mounting holes will let it go even more left or right. It also have a good twist adjustment in case you mount it a bit off level, but I do not see that as super useful. It does sit nice and flush against the wall. and gives a nice amount of swing. Useful for playing games on the kinect or motion games able to twist a tv to face a more open area.",
