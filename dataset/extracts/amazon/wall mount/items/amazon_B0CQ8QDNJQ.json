                "reviewText": "This product is great for a simple installation with minimal impact to the wall being 8 nail holes rather than big bolts and drywall anchors. Don\u2019t expect it to actually be 5 minutes when you factor in measuring how high you want to mount, where to center, etc., but it is faster than traditional mounts. Seemed perfectly fine strength wise for the 50\u201d tv I mounted. Where the product falls short is how high the wall mounts are relative to where the tv hooks onto them. For my tv they would have been visible above the TV, so I flipped the hooks on the back of the TV 180 degrees. Definitely a less than desirable way to mount it as the TV is more prone to sliding off the mounts side to side, but worked. Probably not an issue on bigger TVs.",
