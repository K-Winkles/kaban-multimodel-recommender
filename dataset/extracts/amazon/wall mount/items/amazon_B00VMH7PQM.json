                "reviewText": "I searched a long time before I purchased this item. I selected it because it appeared (based off reviews) to be well constructed and had a larger wall mount so it would be more versatile in terms of where you could hang it. A larger mount will allow for wider range when dealing with stud placement and hanging.Ultimately this is a good product, but I will first highlight the two issues I had with it:1) I mounted the wall bracket completely level on the wall (see attached photo) but when I attached the TV with the other part of the bracket it was not - it was uneven. I imagine it was a result of one of the attachment pieces (the hook portions that attach to the back of the TV) not being manufactured correctly or defective. I solved it by building a small wedge out of masking tape and placing it between the two pieces (the hook and the wall bracket). So, my TV sits perfectly level now but it would not have without making a modification.2) The second problem was my wall. I mounted two of the screws into a stud (on the left side) but I could not on the right side due to the spacing in my building. I went to the hard wear store and bough 4 additional screws and mounted the bracket with 8 total. 2 into a stud and 6 into the plaster. The bracket was solid as a rock afterwards. I would suggest that the manufacturer include a few extra screws but this may have been done specially for liability purposes and weight claims.The good things about this item:1) The instructions are SUPER clear and intuitive.2) I are a ton of parts to allow of different screw depths and configurations/set ups on the back of TVs. I cannot imagine needing more stuff than provided.3) If everything goes right, this is a very quick set up. I hit snags as described above, but had it not been for those issues the TV would have been up in under 30 minutes. It took me 4 hours total for reference (including trip to hardware store).4) It's sturdy, appears to be durable and well-made.5) It looks good. The product itself looks good (even though you can't see it). And the spacing between the TV and the wall is perfect.6) Complimentary USB cable was a very nice touch.7) Shipping was FAST. I got mine in two days using standard.Overall, it worked out for me, but the process did have a few hiccups. I would recommend this item if you are looking for a wall mount.",

                "reviewText": "It is a great product! The thing is heavy duty and could hold a big heavy tv even. My tv is a Samsung 32 inch and I wanted a wall mount for my tv that would last a long time, that was also high quality, and that wouldn't stick out behind my tv when it was on the wall. I also wanted something that was easy to install and at a good price with hopefully free shipping. This ECHOGEAR fit the bill perfectly, and out of all the wall mounts I looked at on amazon and walmart.com, I chose this one and it didn't disappoint me at all. It came quickly in the mail, it was a great deal at $35, and it qualified for free shipping. When I opened the box, it is a very nice wall mount, exactly as described and comes with a free hdmi cord- which I'm not that worried about but it was a nice freebie. I had 24 inch studs, and it fit perfectly just as described. It was so easy to install, the instructions were simple so there was no confusion or twenty pieces to assemble like some of the other wall mounts I've seen on here come in like twelve pieces and the metal is flimsy. This wall mount by ECHOGEAR is so worth the price, so thank you very much ECHOGEAR for making this great product and pricing it so well. I'm so glad I decided to go with this product instead of the others. I don't doubt it will last me for many many years, and it has a five year warranty on it! One caveat, if you want an ultra low profile wall mount, this comes pretty close but it's not ultra low profile, you can get your hand behind the tv comfortably to tilt the tv which I like about this, so keep in mind to figure out whether you want to sacrifice hand space behind the tv so you can have an ultra low profile wall mount-which are nice but they have no hand space, and remember to add the width of your tv to ECHOGEARS profile, mine comes out about 5 inches when we added the wall mount profile-which is about 1.9- 2.9 inches, and my tv is about 2.5 inches thick, so it sticks out about five inches in total and I can get my hand just comfortably behind the tv to tilt it.",

The hardware that the ECHOGEAR comes with can probably fit a wide range of different TV's, but unfortunately it did not fit the new Vizio that I had also just purchased (D43-D1). This Visio requires M6 sized screws, but the ECHOGEAR only came with 12mm and 33mm. The 12mm were to short, and the 33mm were too long. Even when I tried to use the spacers, the 33mm were then a bit too short. Compounding matters is that their support number does not work from Canada (really!?). All that said, a quick trip the hardware store, and 4 M6X20mm later and the TV was properly mounted.ECHO - it may be time to upgrade the screw sizes in your package to meet some of the new high volume sets being sold in 2017.",
