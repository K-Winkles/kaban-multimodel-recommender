                "reviewText": "Was originally hesitant on purchasing this, since I have used other brand TV mounts in the past. This wasn't the thickest, most industrial strength mount I used before, but it was more than strong enough to handle a large size LCD screen.The kit came with everything you needed to install, and the install was very easy. This is a very slim mount that allows you to mount the TV very close to the wall. Another HUGE feature that I haven't seen in other mounts, is it has screws on the top to allow you to adjust the level of the TV. So if the level is ever-so-slightly off, it's easy to adjust, and this is AFTER you have mounted the TV.I bought another one of these mounts specifically for another TV in my house based on the experience I had with the first.Pros:* Easy Install* Clear Instructions* Adjustable Level after mounting* SLIM mountCons:* Not free",

                "reviewText": "This is a solid mount for the price. I didn\u2019t love how the bracket needed to be put together with screws. There\u2019s a little wiggle room with the screws/holes for the bracket where you may not screw it in perfectly straight. However, there are leveling adjustment screws to adjust it once you have the bracket up.I really liked how the bottom part of the bracket snaps into place and has string pull down. Other mounting brackets with screws make it almost impossible to reach the screws at the bottom.The instructions are clear and came with all the necessary hardware I needed.",

A few notes: Make sure the wall bracket is perfectly level while drilling and tightening bolts. They say to pre-drill wood studs with a 5/32\" bit. I found that a 3/16 was better for me. Also, I have not tested the \"tilt\" feature, which it come with.",

It sits perfectly where I placed it and if I did want to move it horizontally, the bracket allows me to slide the TV slightly to the left or right.The only niggle I have is with the strings that allow you to release the clips - they have to be tied up to hide them from view - but that is only a small point.",
