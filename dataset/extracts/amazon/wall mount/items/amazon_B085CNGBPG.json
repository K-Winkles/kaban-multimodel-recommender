Grab an Echogear single stud mount and get that screen on the wall in under 30 minutes so you can get back to sucking down Naturdays with the squad. It's got all the features you need, but with a simplified design that saves time & frustration. Save your frustration for the N64 controller when you get smoked in Mario Kart...again. Mount On A Single Stud Thanks to the single stud design, you can put this puppy almost anywhere on the wall. On top of that, it gives you the maximum amount of swivel for screens up to 58\". You'll get the perfect viewing angle on Zac Efron's chiseled features while he's galavanting across Iceland in his show Down to Earth. How is hair possibly that good? Tilt and level the screen without tools to get a good look at it. Easy Like An Extra Point Unless you're a cursed Vikings fan like me, extra points should be the most automatic thing in football. We redesigned our mounting interface to maximize TV compatibility & minimize assembly time. After an alarming amount of Red Bull's & Kwik Trip chicken sandwiches, we came up with this wall bracket. It makes install about as automatic as an extra point. With the simplified design and vast assortment of screws & spacers, this bracket is as universal as it gets. 55\" Vizio? Yup. 50\" Samsung? No problem. You'll have your TV on the wall in under 30 minutes. FINISH HIM! Pulling off a fatality in Mortal Kombat feels damn good. We put a bunch of extra features into this mount for the cleanest finish to your setup. While it doesn't feel as good as freezing your opponent and ripping them in half like Sub-Zero, getting a clean TV setup is pretty close. Use the integrated cable management channel & included clips to wrangle cables out of the way. Keep them from dangling down the wall by checking out our Echogear in wall cable management options. They'll give you that \"wow\" factor. I hope you read that like Owen Wilson. Pop the wall plate cover on at the end for a modern finish. Now your bolts won't be hanging out for everyone to see.

Every seat can now be the best seat in the house. Simpler Bracket = Faster Install Some mounts come with 50,000 parts and are an impossible puzzle to figure out.

Options to mount on concrete, wood, etc. Just make sure you have solid wood behind drywall location. If not, purchase proper anchor system (like Wingits). Operating the mount was very easy and movement was smooth when pivoting or moving the TV toward the wall or away. At full extension, the mount was strong and showed no sign of failing or struggling to hold the television. The TV used is 40\u201d, but this mount can handle larger size televisions.",

                "reviewText": "Seriously this guy deserves a medal for making this. Single stud..easy to put up may need an extra person to hold it up. The LATCHES on the bottom brilliant.. this isnt going anywhere. Huge lag bolts and again did i mention the latches? No two little screw things up into the metal which i never trusted. This thing is solid..fully adjustable tilt and leveling after install...Too many pluses it is solid..I will buy this again for any TV's i need mounted its done as all wall mounts should be done..Did i mention this guy deserves a Medal for this thing? lolEdit..And you can pull it out all the way and get to the hdmi and usb and power ports easy..no more flashlight looking up under it..or beside it pulling the tv out a hair where you cant see what you are doing. Pull it out the inputs are easy to access .. I can not say enough about this thing..his video..another story lolUpdate I have read some other reviews and thought i would clarify..one said they hired professionals that mounted a 65 in in about in 1and a half hours..but they left being unable to figure this out? Sorry dont buy it at all took me about 20-30 minutes to put it up. The lag bolts go in really deep so if your hearing cracking you may want to check your studs for age or termite damage cause no way this is coming down and its so easy to put up..you should hire new \"pro's\" or you may hear some creaking in your 65 inch soon.Two..another person said the latches on the bottom latches do not line up..had the exact same issue until i realized they are not supposed to. Put the bolt in and press in ..easier with a drill..and make sure not to cross thread it but it will go in..and snug up and mold to the bar. No need to be on hold on the phone they do work but i admit its not like the video where it latches right shut and snug at first try..i think they been using that as an example for videos for a while its already bent. The other option you could use a pair of pliers and bent it slightly so it lines up easier but its not really needed. And if you take it down and put it back up its easier the next time.And will throw in a #3..one guy said cant get it level after mounting even with the bolt in the back. Well it does work and yes there is tilt moving it back and forth but for me you just have to use a little extra pressure..it feels like its at the end just keep turning the bolt it gets tight but it works. This compared to a brand you move around and can not adjust the tilt at all you stuck with it. It may change a little moving it back and forth al lot but it is adjustable and will hold.Hope that helps all Update almost 2 months later..just ordered a stand mount to rig up a soundbar mount not attached to the tv. I will only buy tv mounts from these guys..two months later and that mount hasn't moved a hair out of my wall..did i mention this guy deserves a medal yet? thought i mentioned it..shrugs..:PJust bought another one for my brother for christmas..our friend came over to put it up for him and i think they ordered one to :) I have muscle issues do to a medication thats going away or I would do it for him. Still love this thing its by far better than the others",

                "reviewText": "I have mounted quite a few flatscreen TVs over the years and I found this to be a very excellent product overall and the documentation was very well done, accurate, and smartly funny.. kudos!The only minor issue here, and it's more just an annoyance, is that when the TV (40\" Samsung LCD) is folded against and parallel the wall and I level it there, when I fully unfold it so the TV is now away from and mostly perpendicular to the wall, the side of the TV farthest from the wall is a bit lower, but I can correct that by just twisting the TV against the mount.In terms of cost, this was significantly less expensive than some of the other more regocnized brands and based on my experience, these other brands were not any better.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this product!",

Hanging template and Excellent instructions.Easy to put up and it looks good and works well. Only problem is the leveling bolt did not handle the angle as well as expected. It would not level 100% evenly. I used it on a wall for a reference display for a kitchen team anchored 10 feet above them so it was a max forward tilt and a max horizontal angle. Not a deal breaker - a few degrees off perfect - but it should have lived up to it\u2019s representation, So I took off a star for that",

I think the motion range for pivoting is less than others in the price range but the tilt is definitely better by a good margin and I don\u2019t need more that 90 degree pivot anyway, I only wanted a small range of motion to avoid reflections on the screen. It\u2019s got a good distance from the wall too which was my other top factor in choosing and I\u2019m very happy with it. Didn\u2019t install it myself, but it\u2019s fairly simple, instructions could focus more on being clear over being humorous but that\u2019s just my view. Seems very reliable, easy to run cables along the arm and into trunking, overall, very happy.",
