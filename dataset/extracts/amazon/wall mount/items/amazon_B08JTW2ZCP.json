The range of motion with the TVs are great you can move them so you can see or just so you can plug things into the back. These are full motion mounts so the TV is not snug to the wall but the fact you can move your TV where you want to see it well makes up for the extra space showing behind the TV. The plus side for the TV sitting off the wall is it gives it room to breath. If you do not need a full motion the Flat wall works great and is very easy to hang your TV. These are great mounts for the money. You can spend up to $650 on a wall mount but it\u2019s not going to do anything this one can\u2019t.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mount for my new 65\" TV. It arrived on time and was much heavier than I anticipated, which is a good thing. It was packed well and all the parts were there in good condition. Since these type mounts are universal, you have to determine how and where to attach the Two hanging brackets to your particular TV. The parts bags include several size spacers, screws & washers for you to select from for your unit. Just remember there are extra parts and you will not use all of them. The instructions are good but take the time to study the details of assembly before you jump into it. This mount MUST be attached to framing studs in your wall. Fortunately, I found Two studs at almost the exact position (horizontally) that I wanted the TV. There is a cardboard template supplied with the mount that makes it easy to mark the screw hole locations once you determine the proper height and since I could not mount the brackets centered on the back of my TV (they had to mount below centerline), it took some calculating to get the mount in the right vertical position. Once mounted to the wall, hanging the TV is a piece of cake BUT, in my case required Two people. I could have probably wrestled it onto the hangers myself but I didn't want to risk damaging a brand new TV. The articulated arms to move the TV out from the wall and side to side are stiff enough that the TV stays where you put it. Vertical angle adjustment is accomplished with a small hex wrench provided to loosen a screw on the tilt mechanism. This little wrench can be stored on the mount. All in all I consider this mount near commercial quality and am very pleased with it. Believe me, it's well worth the few extra dollars over the cheapies out there.NOTE: If you cannot mount to framing studs, use the type of wall anchors that have spring loaded legs that expand when you push them through the drywall. I would not trust anything else.NOTE 2: Use a level with the template. There is a level adjustment but it's range is minimal.",

Would be awesome if there was a mark on the brackets you bolt onto back of tv that indicate how they line up to the bracket that bolts to the wall so you can quickly do the math when attaching to the TV.Also, as others have stated, the smaller bracket means you don't have any flexibility when it comes to centering bracket side to side. Easily fixed with a solid peice of plywood or 1 8' 2x4 cut in half. But then your TV will stick out further from the wall so not great if you can see behind TV.",
