Didn't come with any instructions but I found the instructions and a short instructional video online (Monoprice website). Both were visual only, with no instructional text (the sheet) or words (the video), and neither explain how to use the tilt-setting finger bolts. It's next to impossible to tighten them after hanging the TV due to lack of clearance behind the TV. Same for plugging things in. My tip: tighten the tilt-adjustment bolts to lock the desired tilt (very tightly) before you hang the TV, bring the TV close to where you will hang it so you are close enough to the peripheral devices to plug in their respective cables into the back of the TV, then hang it.",

                "reviewText": "Didn't notice the hinged sides on the bracket that allows it to be packed and shipped in a smaller box. This is not a good bracket, weak, wobbly, difficult to mount the TV straight. This has to be the worst bracket I've ever seen. Not sure how this got high ratings from other buyers. When the bracket is not one piece, it's not a good bracket. I would have sent it back but once I got the bracket mounted to the wall, I didn't want to take the chance of tearing out the anchors to remove it and replace it with something else. It does the job, but just barely in my opinion. I'd recommend buying literally any other bracket besides this one.",

                "reviewText": "This is a tight fit. Really! I like the end result in our case because we wanted the TV tight to the wall.But, once this is on the wall, there\u2019s no chance of reaching anything behind to plug in, adjust, or anything else.The two release cords are pretty ugly dangling down below the TV. And with how tight things are, it\u2019s really hard to engineer a way to tuck them out of sight and yet keep them accessible for use when needed.I\u2019ve been a big fan of Monoprice for nearly 15 years. A bit disappointed that this seems to lack the thoughtfulness of their other products.",
