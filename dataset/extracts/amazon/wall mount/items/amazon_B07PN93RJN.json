                "reviewText": "I've wallmounted a TV before, but it has been a few years. That was a 40\" Westinghouse, now I was mounting a 65\" TCL, very different. The details in TV's manual how to wallmount were non-existent! I had to trust the wallmount I pick would have all I need, and more. Some sell for 11-12$, this one I got for $17. It came with all I need, lots of difference size screws and spacers, and good instructions. What you do need yourself is a drill, tape measure, pencil, adjustable/monkey wrench or rachet, Stud Finder, a level (or phone app) and always a bit of luck. First add the two verticle back brackets to the TV. Can use (included) two longer screws + spaces at top of TV, and two shorter ones at the bottom, to create a downward angel to help viewing a mounted TV. This mount does not allow for adjustable up/down tilting, so this is how you created a fixed tilt. Then CAREFULLY pick wall location with stud-finder, makign sure the wallmounted brace will reach two neighboring studs. Doesn't matter as muuch to get the left/right location exact, because once TV is mounted it can slide a bit left/right, but you MUST get the height corret, or you'll have to drill again. Mark roughly with pencil upper and lower drill sites for both studs, drill one and screw in one of the included wall screws (with washer) just enough to keep wall brace hanging, use the level to make sure wall brace is level before drilling and screwing in sites 2-4. It can be hard to tighten the screws all the in due to the raises edges the TV's brackets fit into, so you can use the included short spaces if you want, I did this, but if you want to be able to slide the TV a little left/right as need, make sure scree head stays same/less raised that the track the TV hangs into. Once wall brace is in place with all 4 tightened screws, lift into place the TV, encuring both bottom connections lock into place (has a pull on release if you need to later take TV down. Thope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "Although I didn\u2019t personally install, the Taskrabbit worker preferred putting this wall mount in over the other I had him install. He mentioned it was easier, but the design was also better. Once he installed it, I understood why he mentioned that and started to look for a similar product with more mobility for my living room. I definitely recommend this mount for a space that you won\u2019t do much entertainment in and has little to no light from outside.",

                "reviewText": "This mount came with everything needed for multiple tv types. The single best feature for me is the self locking and releasing clips that mount the bottom of the tv to the mount frame. We need to insure tv's are locked in place here in California due to earthquakes. On this mount, you simply have to pull the straps from each tv mount to release the tv from the frame in case you have to add/remove cables etc. Highly recommend this mount.",
