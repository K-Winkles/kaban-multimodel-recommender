                "reviewText": "I got this to mount a couple of 24 inch monitors to the wall in my daughters room over a small desk tucked in a corner with a mid size dell computer. To mount I needed to hang the monitors directly to the sheet rock which is never my first choice. The mounts are very light weight and minimalist designs but do the job well. There was no issues with the vesa connection to the monitors. I did not use the mounting hardware that came with the mount. Instead I purchased some much larger sheetrock screw inserts that I could screw the wall side of the mount to. ( I got CONFAST 50 Pack Nylon Self-Drilling Drywall/Hollow-Wall Anchor Kit with Screws, (25 Anchors+25 Screws) Includes #8 Anchors with Screws ) off amazon here when I ordered the mounts for about 7 dollars) The confast mounts worked brilliantly and gave a very stable mount. Once wall and vesa side mounts wire installed it was easy to push monitor against wall and slide it down so the computer side slid into the wall part of the mount. There is a bit of side to side play in the mounts that allows the monitors go off level a tiny bit but its easy to just touch it and re-level it. The attachment to the wall is so close that trying to get to mount to stabilize that just isn't going to happen. I consider that a bonus for how close to the wall they are. The desk is very narrow that my daughter is using so the the distance between her and wall is not very far. A mount that pushed the monitors forward would put them to close to her. The monitors were different brands/models so the vesa mounts were at different heights to line the monitors up at the same eye level. One of those things though that you just have to figure out on your own.Over all they were an extremely cheap and effective solution for our needs.",

My tablet was too small so I wanted to mount my 19\" televison to the wall but didn't want to drill holes. I found this little nugget during black Friday and it checks all my boxes. Even if you wanted to drill holes in the wall, it's very small. I purchased strips online so I didn't have to drill any holes, ASIN B001L5U29W. It fits my vesa 75x75mm pattern and proivides all the necessary hardware you need. I really like the slim profile so that it's not sticking out from the wall. I've mounted this over my treadmill so that I can stream videos to pass the time while exercising.",

                "reviewText": "The picture is a representation of the bracket. However the enlarged aspect masks the gauge of the sheet metal. I wouldn't call it \"heavy duty construction\" but it is adequate. It is a basic mount with no adjustment. Due to the design the monitor will have a very slight downward tilt. This can be corrected by installing washers between the monitor and bracket on the bottom screws. Definitely low profile but you do sacrifice adjustability. As for the \"14 to 24 inches...\" I wouldn't have a problem with a larger monitor as long as it does not exceed the 30lb capacity but I personally would not use this bracket in any moving vehicle. I will be buying more.My specific install depicted in the attached pictures...I needed an even greater tilt due to my mounting position. This was achieved with spacers (nuts) on the top screws as pictured. Just wanted to note that I used the screws that came with the monitor not the bracket. The screws supplied were not long enough to accommodate the spacers I used.",

Its easy to remove and replace TV to add or remove cables.
