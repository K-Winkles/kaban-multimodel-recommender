                "reviewText": "The supplied lag bolts are hefty and long enough to secure the frame very firmly to studs. The assembly screws are quality. I like that they included a variety of spacers and screws to fit different TVs. I ended up using two of the remaining spacers to mount my soundbar. Hanging the TV was easier than expected, but I used a spotter to look from the side to make sure I was hooking the TV to the frame properly. I used this with a 55 inch TV and it is very secure. Make sure you attach your TV cables and power cord before mounting because there is not enough room once the TV is mounted to attach cables. I ended up taking my TV down and installing my three HDMI, one eArc, LAN, and power cables before hanging it again. As my plug is on the wall behind the TV I needed to plug that in prior to mounting as well. I should have thought it through ahead of time, but taking the TV down, than hanging it back up again was easy enough. Also, the instructions are very easy to follow.The tilt function is easy to adjust and tighten after mounting, but I used a long handled allen wrench instead of the short one provided to improve access. Overall, this is a well designed and well made mount with the capacity to hold my 55 inch TV securely and safely.When I purchased this mount I also purchased another one that had good reviews. After looking at how it gets installed and at the maximum weight it supports I sent it back and used this one.",

                "reviewText": "The hardest part of the install of this mount was finding the stud in my wall with my wall finder haha. Once I found my studs, this went up in less than 10 minutes. It's very straightforward, the instructions are very clear. There's plenty of parts in the bag to connect various types of TV backings and wall attachments. And at the price of it too! Will be buying again if I ever need to mount another TV.",

The bars lined up with the back of my TV easily, and then I just lifted the TV and clipped it on. All by myself! They provide you with so many different options for screws depending on your use case as well.If you're torn on what mount to get, just get this one :)",
