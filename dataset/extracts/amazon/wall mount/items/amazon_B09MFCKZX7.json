                "reviewText": "This was my first time to install a TV wall mount. Read the reviews on this product, looked very sturdy, bought it. It's very easy to mount to the wall. The bolts that attach it to the wall are very substantial. The mount has great movement for the TV as well. Very easy to pull TV out and connect various inputs into back of TV if needed. However the wall mount bracket is not necessarily level with the arms that the TV hangs on. The installation instructions say there can be a 3\u00b0 variance between the wall mount plate and the TV arms, so you will need to level it by the arms, not the wall bracket. This actually caused me to have to remount the bracket because my TV was not level. Watch out for this. But that was the only thing that I had to tweak. Other than that this is a great TV mount and I am very pleased. Great price point, very sturdy, very happy with this purchase. I would recommend.",

Glad that it swivels so I can twist it to whichever direction I am in my home. Putting the mount up was easy too - but then again, I didn't install it. LOL So far, it's doing what it's supposed to do. I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I used this to hang a Samsung 65\" so it's about 70 pounds. Compared to other similar units, this bracket is inexpensive, though it does lack a few features.Firstly, the wall mount is solid and easily supports the ~70 pound TV. No worries about it falling off, etc.Installation was not the easiest and the instructions do require some interpretation to get right. If you have some general handyman skills and are good with hand tools, it isn't a big deal. The main installation issue is if your wall studs don't line up with the back bracket. There is an available \"extension bracket\" but that isn't nearly big (wide) enough for some configurations. It's just 24 inches wide and needs to be 36. There are mentions in the instructions on installation with a nailer, but unless you are familiar with doing this it is better left to someone experienced. Once the bracket is on the wall, installing the VESA connector using the supplied spacers is a bit hit or miss, but since this is a one-size-fits-all bracket that can be forgiven. Note also that the latest Samsung TVs have a One Connect box hanging off the back of the TV which interferes with the VESA mount. Samsung provides a cable to fix this, but it's not an ideal solution, however that's a Samsung issue not a Pipishell problem.It should be somewhat obvious, but vertical placement and leveling this bracket is critical! This is because once installed, there is only an adjustment for angle (away from the wall) and left-right. I found that you must center the TV on the bracket to prevent it from listing to one side and looking crooked. There is no adjustment or fine tuning for this, hence the 4 star rating.This is a very good bracket at a great price and I would buy it again.",

There is a +/- 3 degree rotational movement on one plate to compensate for this or if you were off when drilling the holes. Easy to do when drilling into concrete. Has a good range of motion for my use. Installed it at the appropriate height so don't strain the neck or eyes while watching. An excellent buy.",

I called a company that installs these as I either dont have the strength or drive to try to hang a TV this big on the wall anymore. I ordered this TV mount as it advertised that it will hold up to a 75\" TV. It came as advertised, and the installer quickly put it together. He was careful to INSURE that the unit was connected by lag bolts to 2 x 4 studs behind the wall or the TV will not stay up. Vitally important. This mount cannot be installed just into drywall with screws and inserts, it WILL NOT HOLD. Bottom line, its working great, it has excellent range of motion, allows tilting of the TV to adjust to many viewing angles and I would buy it and recommend it again. Good purchase. Great price",
