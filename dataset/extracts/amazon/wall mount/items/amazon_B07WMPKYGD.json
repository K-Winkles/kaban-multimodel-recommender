The directions are not so good but for the price and sturdiness, it\u2019s makes up for it. Just make sure your TV is under 55 inches and 50 pounds. I have purchased two of these and installed both myself, one on an older flat screen and another on a 43 in newer tv. You just need a good drill stud finder, some patience, a flat surface to mount the bracket on the back of the TV bed is best and a second set of hands helps when you\u2019re lifting the TV into place. I installed my original wall mount 15 years ago, and it took all day 7 hrs this one I did this one in under an hour.",

                "reviewText": "I don't want to sound harsh, but if this presented significant challenges to install, you may want to consider selling, or donating your tools. This applies only if you received a complete, correct mounting kit, with instructions. A torque wrench is not required, as is asserted in another review, I will assume they meant a \"ratchet\", and simply said torque. You do need a drill, a 1/8 bit, a small level, pencil, and yes... a stud finder (which can be had for under $10, is incredibly simple to use, and every household needs one (IMHO). The instructions make it clear that this must be mounted to a stud concrete/brick, and cannot be mounted on drywall only. The anchors they provide for concrete resemble drywall anchors, but do not use them as such or your TV wi slowly pull the mount out the wall as is illustrated in another review by someone who did not read the instructions carefully, and attempted to use the concrete anchors as drywall anchors in an application where drywall anchors won't even work. They also paid a professional to help, for which they should receive a full refund. If you fully seat the three provided 10mm lag bolts into a stud (in predrilled 1/8\" pot holes) , the mount will not pull out from the weight of a TV that is rated for this mount (I believe the mount would fail long before the lags pulled out of the stud, from excess weight). This is a very sturdy, rugged, easy to install, cersaowall mount, that I highly recommend. This is as easy as it gets mounting something to a wall stud.",
