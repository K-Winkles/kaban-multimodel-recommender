Tilt TV Wall Mount Bracket 1.7 Inch Low-Profile Design With Quick Release Function, VESA 75 and VESA 100 Compliant, Steel Fits up 32 Inch TVs 30 Lbs Carrying Capacity, Black How do I know this mount fits my TV or Monitor? 1. Measure VESA holes on the back of your TV or Monitor. They must match 75x75mm (3\"x3\") or 100x100mm (4\"x4\") 2. Ensure that your TV or Monitor is not heavier than 30lbs! (most LCD TVs under 32\u201d are lightweight) Once, you've checked those two figures, you can be 99% sure our mount will support your screen! When buying a mount, it can seem pretty complicated. But it really comes down to those two things: VESA holes (to screw your mount into your TV) and weight (to ensure your TV is safe on the wall). This high quality tilting wall mount is perfect for computer monitors or small televisions. Featuring a low profile design that sits 1.65\" from the wall and the ability to tilt up to 15 degrees, this mount is as functional as it is visually appealing. Made from high-grade steel. Very sturdy and easy to install. Ideal for new and slim LCD and LED TVs. Wall plate dimensions are 3.9\" by 3.9\". The mount comes with installation instructions and necessary hardware for installation. Buy with confidence. Features / Specifications: - Low-profile design - Tilt downwards 15 degrees - VESA 75 and VESA 100 bolting pattern compatible - Easily installs to one wall stud or concrete, brick wall - 30 lb load capacity - Material: Steel",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This mount is for people who have small to large monitors and or smaller TV\u2019s. I personally have have a 32 inch monitor, and it worked fantastic. The mount comes with the necessary hardware to mount as soon as you receive it. The mount seems to be made of quality metal it feels sturdy. I only wish it came with a couple extra washers but it\u2019s no big deal. This mount only slightly hinges forward and backward so don\u2019t expect a wide range of rotation. Also getting the last screw on top that holds the mount from possibly falling off is kind of a pain to put back in once the mount is on, so I suggest getting a long screwdriver with a magnetic tip so you can put it back in place. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need skinny arms to reach behind. All in all, the mount exceeded my expectations and I\u2019m happy with the price. I recommend you buy it.",
