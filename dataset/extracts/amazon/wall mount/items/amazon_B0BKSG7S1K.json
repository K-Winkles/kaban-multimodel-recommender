No matter how hard I tighten them, the TV slips back into a slight downward angle. Not a deal-breaker, but definitely annoying. Be aware of this if you want/need a heavier TV to be perfectly vertical (parallel to mounting wall) - No wiring harness",

To solve this issue, I decided to attach 1.5 inch plywood to the studs on the outside of the wall instead of using internal bracing. The TV mount was then securely screwed into the plywood. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my old 52 inch Sharp Aquas, weighing over 60 pounds, was easily supported by this setup. Additionally, I was impressed by the wide range of bolts provided, ensuring a perfect fit for various TV models. Overall, this purchase turned out to be just what I needed.",

I wanted to make sure that the mount is rated for double the weight.PROS:* feels \"solid\" and sturdy* all the screws were packaged neatly in its own \"divider\" and labelled cleary (No need to sort through a giant bag filled with unknown screws)* instructions were easy to follow* video link to help with best height calculations was useful (link was in the instruction manual)* easy to make the minor adjustments at the end (tilt, level, etc).* swings out/in easilyCONS* I really couldn't find any consA few helpful notes - (1) I saw an older review/video about \"missing holes\". Looks like they may have reversed one of the pieces so the holes didn't align properly. For me, everything fit perfectly, all the holes were where they were supposed to be. (2) One person could install the mount, but it is helpful to have two people for certain steps. (3) Measure stud locations (from both sides), measure again, might help to use something like green tape to measure out where the TV should go, and pencil markings are your friends. Stare at the wall for a while to make sure you are happy with the height and placement. Measure again....THEN drill into the stud. You know that old adage \"measure twice, cut/drill once\", lol.Overall, very happy with the quality of the wall mount.",
