The socket wrench came with the TV mount is only used to adjust the tilting and leveling screws. It is NOT for the lag botls. How to make sure I purchase the correct wall mount that fits my TV? Please confirm the TV specs and wood studs before purchase. This wall mount YD3003 fits Max 82\" TVs up to 100 lbs with VESA 150x100mm to 600x400mm, fitting Max 16\" wood studs spacing. Let us know if you're not sure about the TV info. What should I do if the TV wall mount doesn't reach both wood studs? 1. Use (2pcs top and bottom) 2x4\" wood boards to bridge across the wood studs then install the wall mount. 2. We suggest another model YD3005 for 24\" stud spacing(search B08XYSBPC5). 3. Kindly let us know and we'll offer further solutions for you! The articulating arm feels stiff/hard to move. The full motion wall mount is normally slightly stiff thus the TV weight won't move the TV from position easily. Please add some additional oil/grease or a little WD40 on the arm joints which will slowly smoothen the movement overtime as being used.",

                "reviewText": "For the money, this is an excellent product. Easy to install, and has a nice, sturdy feel to it. I do wish that it had a slightly wider wall plate to accommodate instances where the stud spacing is not ideal for where you want to mount the TV. You are left with a couple of inches of \"play\" on the TV side mounting plate if you install directly between 2 16 on center studs.",

                "reviewText": "Needed to hang a television in my daughter's room and the bracket I had from a different TV covered the inputs for the cords to be plugged into, so I chose this one. She usually keeps it mounted flush to the wall, but it extends nicely and tilts with some added use of a wrench (included). Takes some fine-tuning if you want to have easy motion on it, but it's sturdy as can be and easy to install.NOTE: Would recommend two people for doing the actual hanging, but it comes with a template for marking holes with a nifty easel-type fold out that holds an included bubble measure to make sure you get it perfectly level. Pretty impressed with this product.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good TV Mount easy to install. The weak link that I didnt like was the horizontal braces that do not come as part of the initial bracket. They are strong enough to hold my 55\" and will probably last the life of the bracket Just was not as sturdy as I would like and had a bit of a sag in the mounting. Nothing to affect the performance just a design flaw that I think I would have beefed up.",

The only thing is the wall bracket is just wide enough for 16\" spaced studs so you have to be pretty on point when you drill as there is no extra side to side space if you don't get the bracket perfectly centered on the 16\" wall studs. Wish they would have made the bracket at least an inch or two wider so you have some wiggle room. Not a big deal though.",
