                "reviewText": "Great product! Super easy to install although the instructions are a bit wonky. The range of motion is amazing. Leveling and tilt are easily adjustable. Probably for legal reasons, it says everywhere in the product listing and instructions that it shouldn't be installed on drywall only - must be into studs. I installed on an interior wall that has only flimsy metal studs (typical Florida condo construction), but solid 1/2\" drywall. I used six 1/4\" x 3\" toggle bolts and 1/4\" x 1 1/4\" fender washers. The bolts have working load limits of 120 lbs. for drywall shear, so unless I have a flood, that thing isn't going anywhere.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. What I Like:Extremely sturdy designEase of installation especially for old style plaster wallsmultiple slotted cut outs allows for a variety of wall stud spacingWhat I don\u2019t like:Two arm design is kinda tight and harder to move than a single armI\u2019ve installed several of these but up till now they\u2019ve all been one arm designs. The two arm design makes it very solid and sturdy, I\u2019ve got only a 50 inch on it, but this thing feels like it could handle much more weight at least upto 65 inches. I like how this design makes it real easy to put the TV up and so when you go to put it up, especially if you\u2019re doing it by yourself, it immediately and easily hooks on to the arm support base and catches it\u2019s weight without leaving you searching hard for it to hook on. I also like how the wall mount base has multiple slotted cut outs all along it\u2019s length that gives you many options outside of the standard 16 inch on center. This was especially nice for me since my house has old style plaster walls that stud finders always fail on and this particular wall it went on was actually 12 inches on center.So far all these are positives. And so the only negative critique I have is that the two arm design makes it harder to move the TV around because the two arms have to move together in a certain way. Pivoting to change minor angles adjustments side to side still work fine, it\u2019s only when you have to move it in a considerable way that it\u2019s a bit difficult. So if you don\u2019t have to move it much and the TV stays pretty much in the same place, this will probably be fine for you. Given all that, at this price point it\u2019s still a very good deal and if I could I\u2019d rate it at a more accurate 4 and a half stars.",

The only thing I had to do was connect the two brackets on the TV that it provided, drill some holes, and simply mount. The TV mount has many features, such as forward and backward, tilting at a 20-30 degree angle, small tilt feature for up and down and side to side on the actual TV. This TV mount has the same features as my more expensive TV mount in my living room. I would buy an exact TV from the same company if I had to install another TV mount. The package came with many different nails and other things, but I simply used only 2 wall nails and did not use any of the other nails or tools that came with it. Very simple installation.",

Feels very sturdy*Easy install - Very easy to follow instructions with pictures (i'm a visual person). There is a template provided to help with bolt placement and level install.*Bubble level included.*Additional pieces included - Multiple install methods depending on you set up and all parts are included.Cons:*The spacing where I wanted to install only fit 1 stud and therefore had to use toggle bolts to securing fasten the other side.Overall great product and will order again if needed.",
