                "reviewText": "Good sturdy mount that works as expected. I could not use the provided screws. They are cheap soft pot metal. The philips head strips before it goes all the way in, rendering the mount useless. Had a time getting it out. I used star bit screws and was able to drive them right in to the studs with no stripping. I bought 2 of these and needed to mount in a place without a stud. I used large toggle bolts that did the trick. Don't fight the provided screws, just find an alternative.",

                "reviewText": "I appreciate the coating but it made the OD too large to connect my Ergo arm too. Had to spend a long time disassembling the mount, rigging it up to a drill, to sanding off the layer of paint to be able to use them. Probably works with cheaper arms but the ergo arm has a tight tolerance to work out of box.",

                "reviewText": "Mount itself is good quality but the installation was terrible because the screws stripped. Every other mount ive had were hex bolts that you ratchet in after you drill the pilot hole. These are regular Phillips head screws. I couldnt turn by hand these into the stud so I got my impact wrench and the heads stripped immediately. Too much hassle to return so just got some lag bolts and now its in.",
