                "reviewText": "For the price, this is what I\u2019d expect, but know it\u2019s not top quality metal. It holds my 80\u201d TV just fine, but there were no frills with this. It\u2019s thin metal. It does come with an assortment of hardware and the bolts can be tightened with a phillips first and then a socket. That\u2019s a nice feature since you can use a drill first and then make it snug with the socket wrench. It\u2019s also nice because it\u2019s 32 inches wide, which is how far apart the studs are on the wall. We had trouble because there was a stud right in the middle of our TV placement but our top quality overly expensive mount did not have a hole in the middle of the mount to go into that middle stud. This one does and the holes all along the top and bottom allow stud mounting anywhere along the wall. I wish I could\u2019ve found a 32\u201d wide mount that pulls away from the wall because attaching components after my TV placement was a hassle. We had to use a phone camera to take a pic and then feel around for the right outlets. So plug your stuff in first!",
