It is a great little wall mount and I do believe it would fit a much larger TV so I like the versatility of this and that it can be used again in the future. Another feature that I really like is that it's very thin, you don't really see it on the wall or behind the TV which I think is a plus. It was easy to install, it's very sturdy and I think for what you get it is good value for the money. It's a good little TV mount.",

It also comes with spacers, but I didn\u2019t need those. It is very secure as the bottom bracket clicks in the place and securely holds the mount to the wall. I also taped up the pull strings that release the bottom part that holds the TV in place with command strips so you wouldn\u2019t see them. Highly highly recommend this for the price and by the way, I have a 55 inch TV.",
