                "reviewText": "Very sturdy mount for my 55\" QLED. Very well packaged and included everything needed to put it up. Only complaint I have is that the mounting screws for the wall studs were too big and weak. The heads kept striping out when trying to screw them into the studs, even though I drilled pilot holes. I finally just replaced them with some long cabinet screws I had, which were much better quality. The screws included were overkill for the weight of these new TVs. My new QLED weighs less than 30 pounds.I highly recommend this mount for newer LED TVs.",
