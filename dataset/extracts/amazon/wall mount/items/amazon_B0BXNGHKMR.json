                "reviewText": "I used this to hang a Samsung QED 32 inch flat screen TV on my bedroom wall at the foot of my bed. The other bracket I purchased at BEST BUY had braces that were too long and showed from the bottom. This bracket mounted very easily and is very sturdy and is compact and flat enough that the TV appears to be flush to the wall. Very easy to take the TV on and off if needed but sturdy enough to keep it in place without any worry. Highly recommend. The similar item I purchased at BEST BUY was over $100, and it didn't even work for the TV they sold to go with it since the brackets showed from the bottom. I found this on Amazon, it was a FRACTION of the price, and it works 100% better than the one that cost 5X this cost!",

                "reviewText": "These things are great. I ordered 2 of them to hang TVs in bedrooms. One 50inch and one 32inch. They are solid and so much easier to use than the mounts I've had in the past. To top it off, they are about half the price!The quick disconnect tabs also make taking the TV down much easier than reaching your hand under and unscrewing the lock screws. I had to reposition mine after the initial mount to add a bit more tilt and it was a breeze.The included hardware has everything you need to mount just the way you like it.Highly recommend.",

It is an anchor method wall mount, so the weight is on two hook like sections on the back of your screen. If you need to move the screen to the left or right, which is easy to do, you will hear a metal on metal squeak.I don't care, I don't need to move the screen, but you might need to very often, if so, maybe get a different wall mount or somehow cover the metal anchoring section in some kind of plastic or whatever.Overall, it's wonderful. Go for it, so cheap yet good, can't go wrong.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this TV mount and will use it to hang any future TVs I want to mount to a wall. It works like a French cleat, with one part attaching to existing mounting holes in the back of your tv and one part attached to the wall. It doesn't require finding studs to mount it so it can be hung anywhere giving you full control of where you place your TV. While it doesn't rotate left or right, it does bring the TV nice and close to the wall - not sticking out 4 or 5 inches like some TV mounts do. I don't like seeing the back of the tv when walking by, and this solves that problem. It is very strong and sturdy - the TV is not coming down until you take it down. Pro tip - use a level or measure to ensure you're placing the part that attaches to the wall perfectly straight so your TV won't hang crooked.",

                "reviewText": "I had an odd location that I needed to mount my 50\" television. and did not have studs that I could use. Because of the size of the television, I did not want to use heavy duty anchors. So, I came across this mount.I must admit, I was skeptical at first. I did not believe it would work and that I would find my television on the floor, in pieces, when I got home. The directions were not the easiest to follow though. But I was able to figure it out. It takes two people to install. and that is not because of weight, but to get it nice and level. The mount comes with a small level, but I can not vouch for its accuracy. For that reason, I recommend using your own level, if you have one. It took my wife and I about 5 minutes to install. It was very easy. Putting the television on the mount was a breeze and I was able to take it off and put it back on. It is early, but it seems very solid. Where has this mount been all my life. I am very glad that I purchased this product and highly recommend it.",
