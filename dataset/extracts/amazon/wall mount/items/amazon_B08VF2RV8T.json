                "reviewText": "I specifically purchased this mount to hang a 65\u201d Samsung TV on a brick wall, and I must say it lived up to my expectations.The installation process was straightforward, with one minor hiccup - it doesn't include the necessary bolts for brick wall installation, I had to purchase these separately. It does comes with a level though which helped in keeping the mount straight on the wall.One of the standout features of this mount is the extension capability. It can be pulled out over a foot from the wall, making it incredibly easy to access the area behind the TV for cable management and adjustments.Pros:Over a Foot of Extension: The ability to extend the mount over a foot from the wall is invaluable. It makes accessing the rear of the TV a breeze and simplifies cable management.Solid and Durable: The mount feels incredibly sturdy and durable, giving me confidence that it can support TVs way larger and heavier than my 65\" TV.Versatile Range of Motion: This mount allows you to tilt your TV up to 15 degrees up or down and swivel it up to 45 degrees left or right. The range of motion adds flexibility to your viewing experience.Cons:Bolts Not Included for Brick Walls: While it would be more convenient if the mount included bolts for brick wall installation, this was a minor setback that was easy to address with a quick trip to the hardware store.Mount Release Mechanism: Detaching the TV from the mount requires a screw, which is not as convenient as a latch-style release. Although it's a minor inconvenience, it doesn't outweigh the mount's overall benefits.In summary, this TV mount is an excellent choice for any installation, even on a brick wall. The extension feature and range of motion make mounting and adjusting the TV a breeze. The cons are relatively minor to me. I'm still giving it a solid 5-star rating.",

                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful tv mount kit. It has every type of screw needed for all vesa mount tv's and monitors and has spacers and washers as well. The TV side mounts are hooked so you can just set it on the mount bars and screw down the straps at the bottom. It makes installation so easy! Holding the tv up and trying to get it on the mount bracket is always the hardest part but not with this kit. It also comes with four 3/8 lags to bolt the wall plate to your studs. Very sturdy and has tons or adjustment options. Even includes a little level, which I though was pretty cool. I will definitely be buying one of these again!",
