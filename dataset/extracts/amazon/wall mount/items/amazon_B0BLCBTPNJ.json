                "reviewText": "We have a 60\u201d tv that is about 70 pounds. The mount that was originally installed was quite heavy itself and caused the tv to stick out of the wall at least 6 inches and hang at an angle.Took forever taking the old one down due to the 6 heavy duty screws in the studs. Broke my wrench getting one of those screws out.This one installed in a jiffy and is so much better. It\u2019s light weight but unlike the other ones that just nail into dry wall, I was able to screw into the studs and am more confident it will hold the heavy tv.",

I saw the product dimensions listed in the specs (17.6 x 2.2 x 1.81 inches) and I should never have placed the order because I have studs that are spaced at 18\" - I don't know what came over me! My bad!. Now I have to go through the return process. I don't like giving a bad review because for a person who has studs spaced at 16\" or less, this product would work well I'm sure. It appears to be a high-quality product. But false advertising does not sit well with me.",
