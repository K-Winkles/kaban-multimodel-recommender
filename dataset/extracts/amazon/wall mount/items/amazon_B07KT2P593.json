                "reviewText": "Great frame and mount system, but the bolts and washers were a little lacking for me. Your experience may vary.The hard thing about universal mounting kits is making them mate to the back of the TV, and the hard part about that is NOT the bolt locations, it's the bolt sizes and lengths, and the various spacers and washers that are needed to mount the TV solidly to this frame.The hardware with this kit is ultimately OK, but depending on your TV it may be hard to coordinate. There were only 2 lenghts of bolts for my size hole, and only a few selections of washers/spacers. So in most configurations the assembly was either just too short (only a thread or two of the bolt in the hole) or too long (a few threads short of snug), so either not optimal. I had some extra washers around the house and was able to make it work perfectly, but be aware of this when you install. Only costs an extra dollar or two for the washers, but it would only cost a few pennies for the manufacturer to include some extras and save the hassle. It's possible that you won't have everything you need in the box it comes with.Otherwise, great mount, great flexibility.",
