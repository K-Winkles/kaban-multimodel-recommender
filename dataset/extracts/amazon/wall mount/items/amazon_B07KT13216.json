                "reviewText": "Loved the price and the instructions included. Also, these arrived quickly. Just in time to get everything set up over the weekend. Due to work from home requirements, my desk was very cluttered. The desk I am using wouldn't allow the usual monitor stand because it is a built-in shelf in an alcove so no place to clamp on. I also use three monitors for work and then two for personal which I also use for work. Instead of playing around trying to find proper studs, we mounted a board to the wall. That way we could place the monitors where needed to save space. This setup works great and allows me to have two keyboards/mice on the desk without issue. I am actually going to order another one. Very sturdy and you can adjust the tilt up/down and side to side.",

                "reviewText": "These mounts are extremely easy to install. The only downsides are the bottom set screw that holds the device is very tricky to reach in order to tighten. The mount does not allow space if you are using a VGA or DVI connection due to it being so close to the wall. I just purchased a DVI adapter if you will. It allows you to insert the DVI connector to the port of device and the DVI cable to the other end allowing the cable to hang down instead of out towards the wall(Bending the cable against wall behind monitor) Here is the linkDTECH DVI Adapter 90 Degree DVI-I Female to DVI-D Male Right Angle Connector Converter Installed in Little Space 1080P Digital Video for Computer Monitor PC Older Projector TV https://a.co/d/e5P7szA It states the mount only holds up to a 26\" device but my monitor is 27\" and very light and it fit perfectly. I attached to the wall using anchors and its fine. The directions state not to attach to drywall only but I think if you are hanging a lighter weight device it will be fine. Very easy to mount. Took me 10 minutes to install 2 mounts. Thats with marking - Leveling - Drilling starter holes and mounting. Very easy.",

Lining things up joining the 2 gets tricky, there's 2 spacers that must line up with the bolt. If you have a second person holding and maneuvering the monitor it would be easier. Measure twice, mount it once is the saying. Stable and looks good when done",

To install device remove center bolt between wall mount and VESA mount first, mount to wall and device then replace bolt.

                "reviewText": "I needed to mount the monitor for the automation server/NVR in the back room of our salon, and wanted to find the least expensive solution possible. The USX MOUNT TV Wall Mount Monitor Mount Bracket (XMS002) is a pretty basic piece of equipment, and it appeared to meet the requirement. I mounted the wall-side of the bracket into a brick wall with two screws. The monitor-side bracket attached to the monitor with included screws and washers. Two sizes of hardware are included, but no spacers are included (should you have a monitor without a flat back housing. The two halves of the mount attach with a single flange, and it's secured with a single screw at the bottom. The whole arrangement is fine, but it does help if you have a long screwdriver. For about $15 (with 10% off coupon, at the time of this review), it's hard to imagine a bracket performing this well for less money. Sure, if you need more features, like rotation or an extension arm, this is not the solution for you. Otherwise, this bracket is great for the price. Highly Recommended",
