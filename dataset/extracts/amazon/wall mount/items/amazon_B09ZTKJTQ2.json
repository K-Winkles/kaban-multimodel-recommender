                "reviewText": "Bought this especially because they were screw into the wall. The description in the photos is accurate regarding avoiding greater losses. Was totally why I got these. Another brand we had for while we got before was stick on. While the installation was much easier to do on the stick on one, it destroyed our wall taking it off. We were painting anyway but the repair would be a lot easier for a couple holes in the wall vs ripping the drywall off with the other brand. Painted to match the wall. Worked great. The plastic anchors were not that good, thin, bent easily, and had to use a some better ones I had on hand. Could have been longer too. Otherwise I would have given five stars.",

Simply remove the tape on the back to reveal the adhesive, and apply to a clean wall. You're then able to open the entire tube and place the wires in. Then simply click it shut, and you're finished. A perfect easy solution to clean up the area surrounding a mounted television.The only issue is that it doesn't provide too much length. Coming in at 31.5 inches, you may need to buy more than one if your television is mounted up high. Luckily they fit together in a modular fashion, so you can buy multiple packs to fit together for one use.",
