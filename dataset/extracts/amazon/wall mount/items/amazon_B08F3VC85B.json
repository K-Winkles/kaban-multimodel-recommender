                "reviewText": "First let me say that I lack the gene that interprets written instructions into an assembled item. These things are hard for me. to do and it takes me a lot longer than it will you. Although the instructions were step-by-step, I couldn't tell which side of the extenders gets attached to the central part. I had to use a magnifying glass on the instructions. (The photos here on this listing are much better, I should have gone back here to look at them.) The manufacturer gives you several bolt sizes and lengths so that you can find the right bolt to fit the back of your TV. And if the bolt that fits is a bit too long, well you get to use a spacer. Spacers are innocent little things but I still wasn't sure how to get them onto the bolt. It will keep the bolt and mount snug together.Regarding the extenders: Don't expect the extenders to be installed symmetrically. It all depends on the size of your TV and where the bolt holes are located on the back of your TV. It'll hold the TV just fine and no one sees the back anyway. So don't tighten the screws of the extenders too tightly because you'll have to adjust them a bit.I borrowed my neighbor's stud finder and to be sure, I drilled a tiny pilot hole. Yes, it was wood. So I used the recommended 5/32 wood drill bit and drilled the two holes. Easy. It was also easy to mount the drywall hanger. Comes with a small leveler. Be sure that you have a 7/16 wrench to screen in the mounting screws. I had only a 1/2 and that did not work. Back to the neighbor's for their 7/16 wrench and that made all the difference. Okay wall attachment is mounted to the stud.Now it was time to hang the TV onto the wall attachment. I like to do things myself but I really should have asked for another set of hands. This is where I broke my sweat. I had to lift my TV a bit higher than y head to center it on the wall mount on these two metal prongs. I could not see what I was doing. I got it there but then realized that I needed these critical two smalls screws to do the final attachment of the TV to the wall mount. Those screws were on the floor and I could not reach them and my dogs do not know how to fetch. So be sure to have those screws ready to use. Once I had them I could do the final turns of the screws. Those two little screws are the key to having the TV attached to the mount.So look at the pictures on this posting, even the box has helpful images. Have the 5/32 drill bit and the 7/16 socket wrench. And a friend if you have to mount the TV up highAs I had to use the widest spacers, my TV has a 5\" profile from the wall. It still looks great and I am very happy with this mount. Everything seems very sturdy. I used a little twisty wire to attach the excess electric cord length to one of the holes in the extender",

They even include a level.If you have all the tools needed to install this, it can get done pretty quickly. I did the installation method using a stud and once I located the stud, marked the holes, drilled the holes and put up the mount, it took about 20 minutes. Literally three screws and you're done. It's a one-person install.I had one issue though. It calls for a 3/8\" socket for the lag bolts. For some odd reason, neither of the two sockets I had fit, BUT I noticed that you can use a star screwdriver bit and screw them in like regular screws. That did the trick!The price is great and a great value for your money.",
