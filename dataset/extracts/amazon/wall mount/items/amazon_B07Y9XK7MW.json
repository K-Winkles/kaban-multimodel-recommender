I used a drill and bits, a level, measuring tape, phillips screwdriver, and a magnet gizmo to find the sheetrock screws (to find the stud). I did not find a paper template to mark the holes to drill. Could have save some time. I used a cardboard mockup of my 43inch TV, and masking tape to see how it would look like. I did like that it was easy to 'hang' the TV on the bolt of the bracket (practice before to understand how the bracket interlocks with the back plate on the TV). My 43 inch TV was only 18 lbs and the mount felt solid. They say 77 lbs max but I feel like 45-50 lbs is a more realistic maximum. It rotates well, and changing the incline was easy.",

                "reviewText": "Bought to mount a TV in a spare bedroom that needed to swing out over a dresser, Worked perfectly, just measure your mounting holes in the back of your tv and bolt the TV bracket together where the instructions for that measurement show. Figure out where on the wall you want it, drill your first hole, mount the wall bracket with one screw, level it (it comes with a small level), Drill and screw the other 2 holes, Easy, comes with many mounting options for sheetrock/wood/ etc and all the hardware, Simple to read instructions with diagrams, Heavy metal and very sturdy, fully extended out and turned the tv is solid,, very happy with it",

                "reviewText": "TV mount provides great range of motion, adjustable pitch (to modify the viewing angle), and with decent quality fasteners (some items from China have crumbly bolts which break apart and strip very easily). The instructions could be a little clearer to read, but that was minor. My only complaint is the way the TV face plate mounts to the wall bracket, using two overlapping circles, you can see the circles in the first picture of the product. The challenge with this design is that the plate mount and bracket never \"stick\" in one position (it's constantly rotating along the circle), so every time you move the TV, the TV gets out of level. It's not extreme, but it does throw the TV level off a few degrees each time you move the TV, which is annoying. I've loosened, releveled, and tightened the TV 3 times now, yet it keeps unleveling itself. (The wall mount bracket is flush level, so that isn't the issue.) Will need to enlist a friends help to hold the TV level while tightening the two level bolts as much as possible. (I ratcheted as tightly as I could without stripping the bolt heads, but maybe need to go even tighter.)",
