The bracket attached to the back of the TV slides easily left and right to allow for adjusting and centering. Super easy to install if you have a drill and 1/2 inch socket. I wouldn't use a screw driver as the bolts used to hold to the wall are super sturdy and require a bit more \"umph\" and will wear you out quickly. Using a ratchet makes easy work of the installation. Highly recommend. No issues what so ever.",
