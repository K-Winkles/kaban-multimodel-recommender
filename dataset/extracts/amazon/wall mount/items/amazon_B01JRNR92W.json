                "reviewText": "I have put together many, many theater systems in my house over the years, but strangely this is my first wall TV mount of this variety so I am not sure if the following is exceptional for this specific mount, or if pretty standard across the industry. A wall mount is, admittedly, a pretty simple tool. Assembling it was straightforward and the instruction sheet included was one of the most comprehensive and easiest to follow I have ever seen. Real effort has gone into the instructions unlike the usual one sheet of broken English and tiny illustrations included with most accessories.The mount came with a package of every type of bolt and spacer imaginable to attach the mounting arms to your TV. My TV already had the bolts so I didn't need any of them but it was wonderful that they included them. It also had the hardware to attach the other part of the mount to the wall. The slots on the wall portion of the mount give you some leeway in positioning the mount on 16\" center wall studs, but if you have a large TV (like my 65\" screen) with the 16 X 24 VESA bolt pattern you will only have an inch or so horizontally to move TV on mount once hung, so plan ahead when you decide where to hang the wall portion.My wife and I were able to easily lift (and then lift again when I forgot a speaker wire that needed to be run behind the TV) the TV and hang the TV portion of the mount on the wall portion. Perhaps we were just lucky, but there was no \"fishing around\" for the right height like when trying to hang a picture on the wall with those little triangle rings on the back. We just lifted and placed. The mount allows you to tilt the top of the TV out a couple inches and in fact if you have a heavy TV you should decide before hand if you want it to tilt or not because out of the box mine ends up gradually moving into tilt position. There are screws you can tighten to end the tilt, but you will have to take the TV off the wall to do so so again, best to plan ahead and decide if you want to tilt or not before hanging.The HDMI cable included seems to work fine. I hooked it up to a Roku box with no apparent issues.If I had to make one change it would be this, and it is a minor one. There are two hanging straps that allow you to reach under and behind the TV to unlatch the TV portion of the mount from the wall portion if you need to remove the TV from the wall. At least with my large 65\" TV, those straps are just a little too short to reach up far enough to make it easy to grab if you have big hands like mine. I can just barely get my fingertips on it and pinching it between my pointer and middle fingers and pulling does release the latches because there is very little pull strength needed, but it is difficult to get between my fingers. I understand this would not be an issue with a smaller TV so if there was a way to adjust these straps beforehand then this mount would be absolutely perfect. This isn't a major enough gripe to dock a star, however, as one likely will never use these straps after the initial mounting until they are ready to dismount the TV for good.Oh, one other thing... the included level is great as a toy for my 4 year old, but not as a real tool. It is usable in a pinch (even though the bubble may not be centered on a flat surface if you swap level end to end and make sure the bubble is hanging the same amount out of the center on each side when you swap ends then you can still make something level.) I didn't use the included level anyway so no big deal.In all, great mount that does what it is supposed to with comprehensive instructions and more included hardware than you will use.",

Once it's installed correctly the TV is actually very close to the wall which has a visual appeal...However if it's also so close to the wall that fishing wires between the TV and the wall is extremely difficult, and putting the wires in first makes it challenging to hang the TV on the rack. I actually had to use an electrical fish line meant for running wires behind drywall.If I were to start the purchase process from scratch I would buy one that would swing out, simply for the sake of installing wires and then being able to push the TV back against the wall.",
