                "reviewText": "The biggest issue I have with this purchase is that my order only shipped with 3 sleeves. On my Samsung TV, the sleeves did fit within the recess, but very loosely. I was expecting a tighter fit so the weight of the TV wasn't resisted by the bolts bending and prying on the embeded nut so much. The length was just a touch too long so I had to grab an extra washer for each bolt. When I purchased the TV, it did come with the proper sleeves, but I have lost them. If you can find genuine replacement parts for your TV I would recommend you buy those instead.",
