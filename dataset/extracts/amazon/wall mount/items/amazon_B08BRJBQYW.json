Has a great range of motion as far as how far it reaches out, how far it turns L&R and its tilt range. Overall, it's a great wall mount for the 43\" Samsung Chrystal 4k UHD TV I bought for my bedroom. It also comes fully assembled and is easy to mount. I grabbed my B&D 18v Cordless Drill and drilled two pilot holes, switched to drill bit for a hex bit and screwed it in to the wall with no problem. The description says it fits a 26\" to 55\". I wouldn't have a problem mounting a 60\" to 65\" to this mount. It'll accommodate the bolt pattern and spread with No Problem. But that's my opinion.",

Took me a total of 20 minutes to complete, directions are straightforward enough & all parts were included. I liked the idea of having to mount into one stud & having a stud finder really helps too.",
