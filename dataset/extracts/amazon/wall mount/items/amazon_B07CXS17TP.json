Drywall is fine but make sure to use studs not just into the drywall carelessly",

This is definitely universal, and I can see it working for a lot of differently spaced studs/TVs.You\u2019re gonna need a strong drill or a socket wrench to get the massive lag bolts that are included into your studs; they have13mm 6 point heads. I used a 3/8 drive.Super cheap and it got the job done! 60\u201d Sony TV.",
