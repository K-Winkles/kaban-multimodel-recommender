We couldn\u2019t be happier with any other TV wall mount than we are with the Mounting Dream brand. If we add a TV in the garage, which we are seriously considering, we will buy another one of these for that TV as well. They can tilt, they can turn, they hold their position.

                "reviewText": "I just installed this on my boat, and I love it so far. Very sturdy. Feels heavy. The arm has a nice amount of friction. Comes with all the needed hardware and even includes a small bubble level for mounting perfectly level. One of the best features for a boat or RV is the arm locking feature. It will not lock with the arm extended. But when in the stowed position it locks very securely. I think it will be fine in any type of wave motion we may encounter. Make sure your TV is designed for a VESA standard mount. If not, get a universal type. I would definitely buy again.",

This could be the fault of the tv, but the screws provided were too long. I have the 24\" spectre with DVD player and it just sort of hangs on the mount. It is good enough and the mount is awesome. It keeps the tv stable while we drive the rv, it is good quality, and the lock mechanism is easy to use. I would recommend that you purchase it as it is affordable and works.",
