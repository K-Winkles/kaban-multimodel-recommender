                "reviewText": "My contractor had to use special anchors to get this TV mount to be secured on my interior load bearing wall. Works well, adjusts to different angles but difficult to maneuver back into against the wall position. I wanted a TV mounted in the kitchen that could be turned to watch in the open dining room and this does the trick nicely.",
