                "reviewText": "This was used in a basement TV room on a 55\u201d TV. The mount is very simple yet sturdy. I have no concerns about this coming off the wall and injuring someone.The mount angle adjusts up and down slightly, which is nice if you\u2019re mounting it higher on the wall. I didn\u2019t use the instructions to install (just used them afterward to verify I did everything right) and I didn\u2019t have any issues. I mounted the main horizontal crossbar into studs - use a level.The TV mounts could likely be mounted in the wrong direction, so make sure you have side access to the angle adjustment screw before you install, otherwise you\u2019ll likely be pulling it off to fix this. The TV brackets also are labeled R and L. I used a dab of blue loctite on the screws before install just for peace of mind - probably not necessary. The brackets have a latch that snaps onto the wall mounted bar. Basic mount for a great price.",

Decent price too.If you are installing into wood studs, you may have he same issue I did.The supplied lag bolts have an oxide coating that grabs and binds when turning in wood.Loud squeaking on every turn. It prompted verbal comments from other rooms. Enough that I wasn't willing to risk snapping any off before being seated.I'm sure they work great if you are using the concrete anchors or with steel studs..Fortunately, I already had galv. plated lag bolts on hand of the same size that turned in smooth and snug with no binding.All finished and does what it was designed to do.Would I buy again? Yes.",

There were 3 different types of bolts with spacers, for wood, brick, or drywall Instilation. The directions were easy to follow and the mount fits perfectly on my 50\" TV.Installation was a breeze, and the TV can easily be dismounted and remounted on the rack if needed. When mounted, the TV tilts downwards for better viewing, with the bottom of the TV protruding 4.5\" and the top 6\" from the wall.",
