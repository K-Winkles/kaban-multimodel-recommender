The easy to assemble design and the included hardware pack allows for quick, easy installation. Flat-to-Wall mounts are a great choice when low profile mounting is preferred, and when managing lighting / glare issues is not a priority. Dimensions: 4.58\" x 4.58\" x .1.3\".",

I have used some other low-profile mounts, and found this to be the best I have used. This was closer to the wall and easier to install.Pros:Very low profile - This is about as close to the wall as a mount can get. There about 1/3\" of clearance.Sturdy materials - It is made of thick and sturdy stamped steel.Quality construction - The parts fit well together. There are no sharp edges or burs.Simple install - It was easy to level and to align and mate the two parts.Cons:None really.Here is a tip: before buying a low-profile mount, make sure all cords to your monitor come straight down and do not go back at all. If they go backwards, the monitor will probably not be able to mount on a low-profile mount.",

                "reviewText": "Very sturdy and a simple install of the back plate. However, it's very difficult to get to the screws that hold the TV to the wall plate, especially because the depth is only 1-1/4\" between the TV and the wall. I had to use an extended flexible shaft with a Phillips bit to get the final attachment screws in place. A bit tricky, but overall, it worked out well.",

                "reviewText": "Looking for a mount for the kitchen that does not stand out against the wall for under the cabinets. I was excited to find this until as it was the lowest profile I could find anywhere. We love the mount but did run into 2 issues. (1) The unit is meant to have the tv slide onto the unit from the top. This works well but since we were mounting it under the kitchen cabinets (and above the countertop) the cabinets themselves were in the way to slide it on from the top. We mount the unit sideways so we could slide the tv on the mount from the side. This means that the weight of the tv is not holding the tv on the mount as it should be. But we places a small shim on what should be the top of the mount (but is now the side for out application) and it is snug in there. We have no worries about it falling off the mount at all. The TV also is straight like this as well. (2) Since the unit is so flush to the wall, we could not install the HDMI cord because there is not enough room with the mount and wall for our particular tv. This was the same issue with the TV power cord. The HDMI and the tv power cords stuck out too far from the back of our tv to attach to this mount (not enough clearance). We fixed this by using mounting spacers to make the mount not as flush as it is intended to be. Works like a charm. For this price point, we were happy to make those very minor adjustments for our application. Would buy again and again!",

                "reviewText": "I got this after returning the SWIFT200 because it covered my audio/video jacks. This one is perfect for my Samsung UN28H4500 28-Inch Smart LED TV, is low profile while still allowing for the cords to be plugged in.Two things:1) I had to get longer M4 screws than what was provided. The manual for my tv recommended somewhere between #16 and #19, and I believe the screws included with this were #12. I bought a pack of #22's and haven't had a problem.2) I could *not* convince the screw to go into the wall anchor even though I lubricated the threads with dish soap as was recommended. I had to end up ripping the whole thing out of the wall, which left a pretty gnarly hole, causing me to have to move the mount over a bit. Not the end of the world, but still inconvenient. My tv isn't very heavy, so I ended up using a shorter screw and wall anchor and haven't had a problem.Overall, I recommend this and would buy it again.",
