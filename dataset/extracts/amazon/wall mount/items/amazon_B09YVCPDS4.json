                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the No Stud TV Wall Mount for my 40-inch TV and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This wall mount is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a sturdy and reliable TV mounting solution.First and foremost, the installation process was incredibly easy and hassle-free. As the name suggests, there is no need to find a stud in the wall to mount your TV. This feature alone sets it apart from other wall mounts on the market. It saved me so much time and effort, especially since I live in an older home where finding a stud can be a challenge.The build quality of this wall mount is outstanding. It feels incredibly solid and durable. I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking it might not hold up my TV securely, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has a weight capacity of up to 55 inches, and my 40-inch TV feels rock solid on it. I have absolutely no concerns about it falling or wobbling, which gives me great peace of mind.Another aspect I appreciate about this wall mount is its versatility. It is designed to fit TVs ranging from 22 to 55 inches, making it suitable for a wide range of TV sizes. Additionally, it offers a full range of motion, allowing me to adjust the viewing angle and tilt according to my preferences. Whether I want to watch TV from my couch or my dining area, I can easily adjust the mount to get the perfect viewing angle.The design of this wall mount is sleek and minimalistic, blending in seamlessly with my living room decor. It doesn't take up much space on the wall and leaves a clean and clutter-free look. It's also worth mentioning that the package comes with all the necessary hardware and clear instructions, making the installation process even easier.Overall, I can't recommend the No Stud TV Wall Mount enough. It is a top-notch product that delivers on its promises. Its sturdy build, easy installation, versatility, and sleek design make it a must-have for anyone looking to mount their TV securely and effortlessly. If you're in the market for a TV wall mount, look no further.",

                "reviewText": "Once we figured out what all the screws were meant for, it went together easily, but we literally used 4 screws out of like 30. They provide screws to fit many different TV's, so you will only use 4 of them...and you'll try SO many configurations of screws, spacers, and bracket before you figure out which 4 fit correctly. The top 2 length likely won't be the same as the bottom 2. The wall strip went on really easy...lots of nails, so it is very solid without worrying about centering on a stud. I totally recommend this wall mount, just pack your patience. Total installation time was about 30 minutes...actual installation time was about 10 minutes once we figured out the screw situation.Update...Liked it so much I bought another one for a 32\" tv. I bought the one for up to 55\" tv's. The wall bracket is much shorter, and the tv hooks are about 1/8\" from the end of the bracket. We are worried vibrations will eventually shift the tv and it will fall. Measure the distance between your tv's screw holes before nailing 20 holes in your wall.",

I know you are supposed to use a stud finder but I didn\u2019t have one.Just a foot note as with the other tv mount I bought they come with little levels do u hang the tv straight.
