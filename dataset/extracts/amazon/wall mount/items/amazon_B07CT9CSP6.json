                "reviewText": "I purchased this item to wall mount a 42\" TV in a bedroom. I used a stud-finder to mount it to a stud for extra sturdiness. It comes in several pieces that fit together once the base in mounted. Instructions are very easy to follow and within minutes I had my TV mounted to the wall, freeing up precious space. Once it's mounted it's very well balanced and you can move the TV from side to side with a touch of the finger. It has wide range of movement from side-to-side. It will also tilt up and down, 8 degrees up and 12 degrees down, so you can easily adjust the screen to fit any viewing angle. I had never tried to mount a TV to the wall before. That's why I'm glad I found this mount from Wali, it's easy to install, took just minutes. It's sturdy, secure, and has a wide range of adjustments. For the price, this is a great purchase.",

Once you get the bracket on the wall and the arm on the tv, it has a 1\" shaft that drops right into a 1\" hole with ease. No fumbling around trying to line up the connection.

                "reviewText": "Contacted by way of email to Wali Electic concerning the mounting of the wall bracket to the aluminum frame of my vintage RV. I wrongly assumed parts were missing.Explained the problem I was having with one of the parts and I received a response from Chris in Customer Service. With Chris help, I was able to resolve the issue in less than 1 hour and 3 mail. (yelp it was my fault) Awesome!!The product - heavy metal, which I like, looks nice and easy to install. I purchase the mount bracket to to use 1 TV in the RV and transfer with ease from one bracket in the front of the coach to rear bedroom in the back of the RV.Plan to purchase another for the house.
