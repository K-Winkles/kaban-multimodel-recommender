                "reviewText": "I was forced to install this alone. I can't urge you enough, if you have a big TV that is hard to handle, get a spotter at least, so they can tell you which way to go, so you can easily hit the bracket. Also, the screws that adjust the front/back angle, are not tight from the factory, so when I first got my TV on the bracket, it immediately started tilting forward, which could have been a problem, but fortunately wasn't. On my 2nd try, I tightened up the screws properly for that adjustment, and it greatly simplified that aspect of the install. If the long small screw on the bracket is in the way of installing the screw in the TV, then I recommend completely removing that small long screw, instead of trying to work around it. You'll also need that screw unscrewed most of the way to be able to get it on the bracket anyways, so if you screw it in to get it out of your way, you'll end up moving that screw back and forth more than necessary, so just unscrew it completely to simply your life, then reinstall it after you have the TV mounting screw in place.The instructions for mounting this bracket is good, and easy to understand. They give you plenty of safety warnings. You also get a cardboard template to help simplify finding the right place for your screw holes, but my template wasn't properly put in the box, and was bent, and slightly damaged on one end, but it still performed it's job flawlessly. They didn't have to put a template with this, but attention to detail like that makes this a well polished product. The only thing I think they could have done to make this better, would be to put an extra hole in the bracket, in such a manner where you can store your adjusting wrench (they give you), in the bracket, so you don't lose/misplace it. Also the lip on the top of the bracket, could make that a good place to store infrequently used items, like a spare key or something small you want to keep out of sight.They tell you to test this bracket before installing your TV on it, which is really good advice. Hanging on this mount, gave me a good feel for how sturdy it is, and it is very sturdy. My TV is a little under 50 lbs, which is 1/2 the weight this is claimed to support, and I have no doubt it could handle more than 100 lbs. The 2 arms that move on each side, are a little stiff, but that's good in my mind, because you don't want this type of thing to flop around. If I extend the arms out all the way, I can turn my TV to any angle I could possibly desire. I am very, very pleased with how well this mount operates and works, and can recommend this mount for anyone that wants this type of flexibility with mounting their TV.",

                "reviewText": "I love the angles and range of motion on this mount. Please for the sake of your televisions life, read the instructions before you take everything out of the box. It clearly tells you what you need for what situation and provides all the pieces you need for stud mounting and concrete mounting. There's even a level in the box which, if you don't have one, I'd recommend keeping for future leveling situations. You never know if another mount doesn't come with one. Anyhow the template with the level makes things fly. I had my 65 on the wall by myself in about 30 minutes once I located all the wall studs with a finder. If this isn't your first rodeo I'd say about 10 minutes will do it.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first tv wall mount I have ever had. I have always been afraid these would fall and break my tv. My wife and I have been looking at redecorating the house and I have been wanting something different than a tv stand.I recently replaced my old broken 55\" tv with a newer 65\" tv. The television is the maximum this mount is supposed to be able to support (65\" and 100 lbs, actual scale shows 97.4 lbs).The mount is also for 16\" wood studs but am not certain as to the actual studs my house has. The area the television has been was where I was looking at putting this on the wall, just of course a little higher. The stud is right in the middle of where it was going to be placed. Looking at the opposite wall would be the same problem. I did not want to put this mount anywhere else so need to do a lot more work.I have not hung this up yet because I will need to tear out the sheet-rock and add wood to the framing to give a mounting point. My wife and I are still deciding exactly what we will do. With the weight of the wall mount, I will also need assistance to help hold it up. I do have arthritis in both shoulders but my right side is worse, fingers and my back. This makes it difficult to do anything that has any substantial weight to it, like this.I will update after we get this mount on the wall and see how well it holds up for a 65\" television near the weight limit.",
