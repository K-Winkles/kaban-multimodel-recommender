                "reviewText": "I got this for mounting a repurposed computer monitor above the bathroom jaccuzi for streaming videos. I needed a mount that would lay flat when not used, and could pull out and turn 90 degrees when in use. Because this is only a 24 inch monitor, it doesn't need to be the big monster TV wall mounts that are more common. So this is perfect for the need. It holds the monitor firmly, and the joints can be adjusted for how tight or loose they are. I also like the fact that it comes with 1/4 x 2\" lag screws, so I didn't have to get them separately. I definitely would not try installing this using the supplied drywall anchors, though.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this product does what it's supposed to do and is a great price. I downgraded the installation because the box came with no instructions. Even though the install is fairly obvious, there is one adjustment you need to make before mounting the tv. Otherwise, your tv will lean to one side or the other. Also, I heartily recommend installing wood studs and not even thinking about using the included wall anchors.",
