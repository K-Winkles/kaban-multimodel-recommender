                "reviewText": "I bought this to hang an oldschool 80\" Sharp LED that weighs 131lbs and am very satisfied with it. It I tried to push it to its limits at 150lbs I might be a little concerned about its ability to hold the tilt but I have no reason to doubt that it would hold the TV itself.Installation is straightforward and I really liked that it included a good mix of bolts and spacers to support almost any configuration of TV setup. I drilled this into studs under Durarock and it is absolutely solid. Installation is easy to do with one person but hanging and adjusting a TV will require 2-3 depending on how much it weighs.The tilt features work smoothly and hold the TV in place no matter how you put it. Again, if you're right at the 150lb mark I don't know for sure whether or not you'd be happy but at 131lbs its holding the TV exactly where I put it. Great range of motion and being able to pull it away from the wall, work on it, then shove it back up against the wall exactly where I need it is a huge plus.",

(Our past mount would droop over time) My walls have 24\" stud spacing, so centering the tv would not be possible without the side to side sliding hardware. I am very happy with the sturdiness of this mount, and the side to side adjustability made centering on our wall a snap!",

All sorts of screws and spacers are provided and the wall template that they give you makes it very easy to line up the mounting screws to your studs. Since the mount can slide from side to side you will have plenty of play to be able to mount to the studs even if they are not centered.Once you have the mount installed it is very simple to hang your TV and the stand is very sturdy. My TV is not going anywhere. It's great to be able to pull the TV out and angle it whenever you need to move a cable around or something like that. This is an excellent piece.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic tv wall mount. I had another brand ready to install and discovered that my studs were 24\u201d apart, not the standard 16\u201d. So I bought this one and it solved the issue. I drilled the holes into the studs and used the included lag bolts to screw the mount securely to the wall. All hardware was included and I easily installed the brackets on the back of a 65\u201d Hisense TV with attached sound bar. I like to organize cables so I used clips and sticky Velcro to mange cables. I wanted a while cord hanging down so I bought a small flat square power strip and used sticky Velcro to attach to the back of the tv. All items are plugged into that, and when I pull the mount out, only 1 white cord hangs down. It\u2019s solid and I can pull it out and swivel it to watch from a different angle. I\u2019m a female in my 60\u2019s. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb Would definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This wall Mount is one of my favorites and this company is one of the best as far as giving you plenty of advantageous hardware to make sure you safely and solidly install their mount. We had a professional for this install, and he likened it to the mounts they sold at Best Buy at 2x and 3x the cost. He stated that the quality was really good and the hardware kit was exceptional. Nice additions like Velcro ties for the cables is always a great benefit too.This was installed directly into studs and we sunk the lag screws provided and they were extremely solid. Using a hammer drill to get it as tight as possible after pre-drilling the holes was beneficial and allowed for an ease of install.Once the Mount was on the wall, the best part of this system became evident - how the TV hangs on it. By installing the hardware on the back of the TV we were able to lift the TV, set it on the upper bar, and then flip up the securing brackets on the lower bar, screw them in, and it was done. It is one of the easiest mounts to install the actual TV and also one of the most secure mounts I\u2019ve used and we have 4 hung TV\u2019s in our home and on our patio. Whenever we upgrade other TV\u2019s we will be upgrading the mount with this one. It\u2019s incredible and I would highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Very impressed by this TV mount. After reading reviews of other mounts I was concerned about overall quality and the ability to handle an 80+ pound TV but NO issues at all with this mount. Screwed it into the studs using the included lags and it's rock solid - no worries about extending the mount fully as it easily supports the weight. Also the side to side tilt adjustability makes it easy to address any issues with the mount being slightly out of level - just loosen a couple of hex screws, tilt the TV to where you want it, and tighten the screws back up - easy. I feel the price paid for this was very resonable given the quality.",

The 24\" max stud spacing (wider wall plate) provides a more stable wall mount, even though I use the 16\" spacing on 2x6 studs. Lubricated with \"SuperLube\" oil to make the arms to move smoothly. This is a very well made and sturdy TV mount with adjustable features. Glad I purchase this mount over the Sanus brand. Familiarize yourself with the functions of the mount and the install will be easy. This was the 4th time for installing TV mounts, not my first rodeo. Highly recommend",
