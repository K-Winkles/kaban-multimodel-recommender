                "reviewText": "Upgraded our main TV so the old one went into the bedroom. It's pretty far across the room so I wanted a mount that'd give me every inch closer to the bed. This wallmont is well built and the included hardware is good. One thing to note is that it's for 16inch on center studs. I didn't realize I have 24inch upstairs so I had to fab up a mounting plate from from 3/4 plywood. Not a big deal if you have the tools. This wallmount mounted to that plate holds over 100lbs easily in testing. Our actual TV is a 65inch ~65lb and has zero issues supporting that at full extension. It adjusts easily. I really have nothing bad to say about it the mount or the install kit it comes with. Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item, this is not a paid review. I ordered this to mount a 55\" TCL Roku TV. The mount appears to be well made and very sturdy. It is easy to extend, swivel, and tilt and stays where you put it right out of the box, no annoying drifting. The price is very attractive, even better than a similar item at a local \"freight company near the harbor\". Everything was included (except tools, of course), even a small level and some Velcro cable ties. Like another reviewer, I used a longer level just to be safe. Hanging it was straightforward, a stud finder makes it easier. Very pleased and would definitely buy it again.",

They send a nice package of hardware to connect to many TV styles. The design is really solid and easy to install.The mount is just big enough to span two wall studs, so there is not much flexibility there. You can slide the TV a few inches on the mount. So it worked for me. If it lined up centered on a stud, I guess you have to attach boards to the wall.",
