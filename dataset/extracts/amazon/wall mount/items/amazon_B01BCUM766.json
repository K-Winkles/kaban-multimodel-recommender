The best part about this is how easily and securely the monitor and bracket attach to the arm \u2014 simple and strong!I used this to mount a 27\u201d flat screen monitor to the wall. It took about 10 minutes from start to finish, and it was incredibly easy!I would definitely buy this product again \u2014 well worth the price, and you get exactly what you need! It comes with everything needed for installation; it even comes with the screws to hold the monitor onto the mounting bracket.",

                "reviewText": "We have a small Visio flat screen TV in our guest bedroom that we occasionally use along with our elliptical machine when working out. Until now the TV always sat on a window sill. Had the idea to get an articulating wall mount for it, and Amazon had many to choose from. We picked this one because it extended far enough out from the window trim so that the TV could both swing to face the elliptical and pivot around 180 degrees to watch TV from the bed. This was simply perfect. The mounting hardware is robust and sturdy. Almost took take a star off because the screws that attach the mount to the back of the TV needs some washers because the screws are just a tad too long. They fit, but you can't quite tighten them down snug and the TV wobbled a bit when moving it. A quick search in the workshop provided the washers, and that was that. As you can see in the photos the TV is positioned perfectly in front of the elliptical, and there's another photo showing the back where the washers were needed for the mounting screws. If you have a small TV with 100mm spaced mounting screw holes on it, this is a real winner.",

The price was also great!Installation was easy, however, one thing to recommend.. loosen the bolt on the back of the mounting plate before you hang it on the arm! If you want it to tilt, this was much easier to do with it off of the arm. I would also recommend a better wrench. Otherwise, there were no issues with installing it and it works great! Definitely recommend!",

The first item was a wall mount for the Sonos Beam. It was excellent. The next couple of items I bought from them were also great quality. And this one is no different. Some overseas companies use cheap/thin metals and inexpensive fasteners. All of the products I\u2019ve gotten from these guys have been durable and robust.The arm extends far enough from the wall to be quite useful (not only when mounting it, but also when adjusting for viewing). If you end up placing it in the corner of a room, you\u2019re able to position it parallel to either of the two walls. So, very flexible viewing options.When mounting it, once the top bolt is in place, the bottom hole is wider making it super easy to level. Before tightening the bottom bolt, you can slide the mount a little to the left or right in order to make it perfectly level. There\u2019s no tilt (up/down). Just something to note.Overall, this is a simple yet effective mount for smaller TVs or monitors. Excellent value and an easy recommendation for consideration.",
