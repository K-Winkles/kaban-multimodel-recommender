Ease of install is fantastic. No complicated weird mechanics. Screw into studs in wall. Level. Bolt mounts onto TV. Hang TV. Lock in place. Simple. Range of motion is great and smooth action.",

                "reviewText": "TV mount was very easy to install and operate. One thing I will say is although the package came with 2 different length bolts to attach the mounting plate to the back of the TV, just be aware that some TV mounting holes may not be deep enough to support the short bolt by itself and the long bolt may require that you use 2 spacers on each bolt. But overall, the mount is a good product.",
