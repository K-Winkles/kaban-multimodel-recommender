So if that doesn\u2019t say anything, keep scrolling other options. But for the price, availability, (aka was delivered super fast) you can\u2019t beat it.I will say tho, with bigger TVs, because of how \u201cwide\u201d and spread out the TV mounting holes are (*not the mount) it doesn\u2019t give you the option to slide your tv left or right as much when mounted. But the fact you can hit three studs (mount wise) you can place it dang near anywhere and be confident you have the support to do so. \u2026this is the same with 95% of tv mounts with bigger TVs, so take that as you will.Overall. If I needed to hang a 90\u201d tv, I\u2019d buy this one again. Without worry.",
