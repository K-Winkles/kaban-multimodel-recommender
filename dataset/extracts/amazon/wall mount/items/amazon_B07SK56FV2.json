                "media_text": "SLIMply the Best What's the point of a flat TV if it's not... well, flat? Holding your TV just 2.25\". from the wall, this ultra-low profile mount is perfect for SLIMple setups built around straight-on or mostly straight-on viewing. Worried about cable access? Don't worry - we thought that one through. (That's what they pay us for, after all.) Just pull down on the bracket strings for easy TV removal or port access. It really doesn't get much SLIMpler than that! We're Easy Like That You've got a simple setup and you need a simple mounting solution. What's the definition of counterproductive? Said simple mounting solution being hella hard to install. And that's exactly why we made sure ours is the opposite, installing in just three easy steps: Mount wall plate, attach TV brackets, hang TV. Oh, and did we mention you can knock it all out in less than 20 minutes? Yep. That's real life, and our handy, dandy installation manual breaks it all down in straightforward, easy-to-follow instructions. Level After Install Getting it right the first time? In theory, that sounds great. In reality? It just doesn't happen all that often. That's why this super slim, low-profile mount was designed to be leveled even after the wall plate was installed. Just grab a screwdriver. Armed with that and just an easy twist of the hand, you can kiss unwanted crookedness goodbye. (As opposed to wanted crookedness, apparently? That's just lazy writing. Our bad.) The Perfect Fit You get a mount! And you get a mount! And you, and you - everyone gets a mount! Because if you're looking for a TV mount, there's a good chance this one will fit. Including hardware compatible with a laundry list of today's hottest brands - Samsung, Sony, Vizio, TCL and so many more - this low profile mount is universally designed to work for most flat panel TVs weighing up to 150 lbs. Want to make sure it'll work with yours? Check it out! If your TV's VESA pattern is on this list, it'll fit: 200x100, 200x200, 200x300, 200x400, 300x200, 300x300, 400x200, 400x300, 400x400, 600x200, 600x300, and 600x400. Not sure of your TV's VESA pattern? That's ok. Go to our website and find the MountFinder Tool at the top of the page. Once you enter your TV model number, you'll have a list of compatible mounts in just seconds. It's like magic! But really, just really, really, really good coding. Thanks, Echogear web nerds. We heart you.",

This thing has the muscle to hold it up, and the hardware to ensure compatibility. It's built to work with basically all TVs from 42\"-90\". Level It Up Had a few beers before installing? Not great at geometry? We get it. Sometimes the mount just isn't quite level after install. Luckily you can adjust it 5\u00ba down or up for the perfect finish you promised your wife.",

Anything more and the house will be damaged anyway and the tv is the last of my worries.I like that there are screws to adjust the level of the tv.I did t need to use them but good to have.Overall great value for the money. We just wish we could along the up/down angle a little since we mounted the tv above the fire place.There would be a way to do that but that would require me to remove a screw from the bracket and I rather have the stability instead of the tilt.",

                "reviewText": "Quick and easy to install, quality is on point and the mount is very rigid once installed on the wall. I used some small ledger bolts instead of the supplied screws or anchors. I definitely recommend mounting to the wall studs instead of using the included wall anchors. The frame itself is not rigid until fully fastened to the wall, due to this I suspect that wall anchors installed to drywall will loosen over time when adjusting, removing/installing the TV.",

                "reviewText": "I know, everyone is looking for a low price for TV mounts these days. I was too when I selected this particular mount and company. Boy, did I get SO MUCH MORE than I paid for -- hopefully Echogear won't see this post and raise their prices.First of all, you get everything you would expect from a TV mount - my TV is 77\" so I needed something that was sturdy for the job. The mount is sturdy and mounts easily regardless of wood/concrete block/metal studs. The mount allows for you to install it as close to center as you can and still adjust the TV from left to right to fully center after installation (to accommodate for stud placement, etc). Brackets lock on the mount so that the TV will stay once installed. All of this should be expected from any mount.For the unexpected, the instructions and box graphics were really good. Why is the important? To me, if they are going to put extra time in placing humor in the instructions to encourage you to actually read them and dress the packing up with graphics, etc., then that tells me they pay attention to details which is what I want when I put a $2,500 TV on the wall.However, the best feature I was not expecting was the ability to adjust the tilt of the TV once it is installed on the wall. With the larger TV's, even a small tilt in the mount creates a significant tilt on the TV once it is mounted. Once that initial mount is attached to your wall, it is very difficult to make any permanent adjustments with other mounts. The brackets that attached this mount to the TV have adjusters that can assist with those fine-tuning adjustments so that the TV is level once you are finished. Absolutely the best feature of this product and something I will look for in the future.",
