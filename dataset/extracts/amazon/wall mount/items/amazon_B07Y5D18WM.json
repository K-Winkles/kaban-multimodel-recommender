                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I wish I had been brave enough to try a TV wall mount years ago. Frees up so much space in the room. I installed this by myself, a wimpy armed woman ;-). Once you are confident about the centerpoint of your studs (don\u2019t guess, use a stud finder and mark the edges and center), and how far apart they are, it is super simple to mount. Mine were 16 inches on center, so I did not need the extra bracket piece. The only thing I would\u2019ve done differently, drill the top two pilot holes first. Then mount the bracket and level it. Then drill the bottom two pilot holes and screw in the last two lag bolts/screws. The directions may have said that, but of course, I hardly read them, lol. The bracket is more than sturdy enough to support our TV. I have a 55\u201d TCL Brand Roku TV from Costco. I\u2019m guessing it doesn\u2019t weigh more than 40 pounds. I was able to install the bracket and mount the television without any assistance from the hubby. Other than borrowing his tools. I did not use the feature where I can tilt the TV. Our room is fairly small, it is an office, so really didn\u2019t need the tilt feature I tucked the release cords behind the TV by loosely tying them together to shorten them. I will be getting a cable hider for the TV power cord. Probably a white one, since my walls are pale yellow. Buy this, worth every penny!",

A stud finder, not furnished, is also required to install it in a frame wall. The basic frame (wall portion) is in two parts, the smaller may or may not be needed to accomodate the stud spacing on a frame wall. It attaches to the larger section with two screws easily. A good quality part for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Installation went smoothly till I had to adjust the tilt of the TV. I actually had to remove the TV from the wall and adjust the tilt before reinstalling. There is no easy way to adjust the tilt while the TV is hanging on the wall mount. The adjustment requires a screwdriver and a wrench to hold the nut - and there are two on each TV bracket (you can only reach one while the TV is on the wall). I got it close enough for now, and hopefully the adjustment is done infrequently - but still it was a surprise after mounting close to a dozen TVs to encounter such a difficult adjustment.",
