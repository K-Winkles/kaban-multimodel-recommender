I decided that having success with other Mounting Dream products, I\u2019d give this a try. It was on sale for around $15.I was able to get this mounted to the wall and the pieces put onto the tv in around 15 minutes alone. The tv easy snaps into place and feels sturdy.A couple points to note:I think if you lifted straight up for the bottom of the tv after being mounted, you could pull this mount out of the wall.It says it\u2019ll support 100 pounds. The tv I used is 25 pounds so I\u2019m well within the safe zone.Hopefully this holds up. It was super easy to put up.",

                "reviewText": "this mount is very sturdy and well built. the nails go in the bracket at an angle and pass through two holes in the mount before entering the drywall, making it very durable and stable. this will fit any tv with screw holes in the back spaced 16 inches or less apart. it says up to 60 inch tv, but mine is a 70 inch and fits it perfectly. my tv weighs 50-60 pounds and the weight limit for this tv mount is listed as 100 , which is perfect for any tv up to 80-85 inches. the tv feels like is has a firm grip on the mount and is hard to move back and forth when sitting on the ledge of the mount. ive attached a few pictures of my 70 inch vizio, and views of behind the tv and above the tv to see the mount on the wall. 10/10 would recommend this for any tv needing to be mouted WITHOUT STUDS! no anchors, tools, studs, bolts, nothing required except a small hammer. everything else is provided , and you nail straight into the drywall.",

I watched the tv for an hour to make sure it didn't move or drop and nothing. Been a few days and I'm confident it will stay for good. Great product for the price and ease.",
