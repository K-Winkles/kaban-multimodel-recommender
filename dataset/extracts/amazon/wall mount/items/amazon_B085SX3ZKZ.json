I think my tv is about 32in or so(?) and it fit perfectly! At first I wasn\u2019t sure which screws to use on the back of my tv, but I looked at the sticker on it, and it told me exactly which screw to use. Upon first glance, I really didn\u2019t think it was going to be very sturdy, BUT the quality is actually really good. And assembly was extremely easy & quick. I personally only used half of the nails that were provided, and put one nail in every other hole, and my tv isn\u2019t going anywhereee, even if I try shaking it. It also comes with a safety line thing that you attach to the back of your tv, then screw into your wall, but I personally felt like I didn\u2019t need mine because of how sturdy it already was. Bottom line is that this tv mount is AMAZING and 1000% worth it! I\u2019d give it a 1000/10 if I could. Run, don\u2019t walk!!!",

                "reviewText": "I found the PERFECT spot on my wall for my tv, but there were no studs. None. So that expensive mounting bracket I bought with all the fancy features? Unusable, sadly. The fancy features were the least of my problems though, I really just needed my TV mounted as I had no room to put it on a stand.I came across this studless mount while searching amazon to see if such a thing existed; low and behold here we are. There's no way that works, I thought. How could that hold up a massive tv? I Googled studless mounts and found many people highly recommending -against- using one of these for a multitude of reasons. Since I was completely out of options by this point, I bought it anyway out of desperation.It was pretty easy to install, you literally just hold it where you want it, and hammer down something like 20 long nails through the mount deep into the drywall, be sure to use the provided level. After that was done, I put pressure on the mount to test how solid it really was and to my surprise I couldn't move it at all. I put the included bracket on my TV and hung it up. It's been a couple of months and it's still extremely solid. I put lines on the wall to test if the mount would sag over time, and the TV hasn't moved at all.My TV is an LG UQ9000 55\" that weighs 31.30lbs. Although I was extremely skeptical using this product, I have to say it blew me away and exceeded my expectations. Does it tilt and rotate and extend? No, but my TV is mounted and I'll take what I can get.I highly recommend this product for those like me who found that \"perfect spot\" but no studs. Just follow the directions and use the level! Easy, cheap, mounted.",
