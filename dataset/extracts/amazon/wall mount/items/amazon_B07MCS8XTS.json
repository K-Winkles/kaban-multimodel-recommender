The adjustable width is a great feature. Watch my video. As you can see my modem barely fits. I didn't realize the flare at the bottom. But that's on me. If you have a stud in the perfect mounting place, I believe this can support some heavy stuff. My modem is around a pound (0.45 Kilograms for Y'all metric folks), therfore I used the included hardware. I gave it a tug or two. The hardware holds. I probably should have videoed that part, but I didn't.",

                "reviewText": "This was very easy to install. Can be done in 10-15 minutes. I would rate this product a little better if the bungee strap that it comes with secured your device better. It does hold, but it comes loose from the mounting edges to easy. Its basically a light bungee band that anchors to the ends of the mount via 2 small metal hooks. The hooks are too small to reliably hold the bungee in place. If your device gets pushed to far to one side the bungee pops off the hook and there goes your device. Also, the rubber bungee is kind of small and barely wrapped around my small LG blu-ray player. If you have a wide device the bungee will not work. I don't think the bungee is even long enough to wrap around a PS3. This could me your device may fall to the ground if your not careful. The adjustable depth plate works well, but it's not enough to hold your device secure. If you push your device to earthier side without the bungee it will most likely fall off unless you have it sandwiched really tight between the adjustable bracket plate. I will have to see if my blu ray player does not fall.At the end I am OK with the product since I only have a small cheap blu ray player. I would not trust this product with any expensive device like a PlayStation or X-Box etc.",
