                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It's a sturdy extended mount with a couple minor gripes",
                "reviewText": "I bought this to mount a 32\" Samsung TV to the wall behind my refrigerator. The arm had to be long enough to allow the TV to clear a 12\" deep cabinet while the screen was turned perpendicular to the wall for viewing. My installation was through a hard plaster wall into a 2\"x4\".The Good: The wall mounting plate and swing arm are very sturdy. It comes with all the hardware you need to mount your TV. I definitely appreciated the cardboard mounting template.My Gripes: My TV has a 100x100 VESA mount pattern, the mounting plate obscures an AUX audio and digital audio out connection. Even with spacers and longer screws to move the plate away from the back of the TV those connections would be difficult to use which may be a consideration for those mounting a smaller TV.The TV and VESA mount adapter hangs onto the end of the swing arm and secures with two M6x12mm Allen head cap screws. Those screws have washers that are captured (not easily removable). The diameter of the washers in combination with the how close the holes are to the end of the swing arm end make it difficult to start the screws. I ground a little bit of a flat on the washers so I could start the screws straight in so as not to cross thread them. The VESA mount is about .080\" thick so be sure you don't strip those holes. The included Allen wrench could be longer, I used my own long shank 4mm Allen. I spent more time getting the VESA adapter plate onto the end of the mount than it took getting the mount on the wall.Final thoughts: The long swing arm and wall plate are extremely sturdy however, personally, I wouldn't trust the VESA mount adapter with a TV larger than a 55\".",
