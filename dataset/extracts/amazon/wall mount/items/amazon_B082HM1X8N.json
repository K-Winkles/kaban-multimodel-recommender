                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 600mm x 400mm JUST!",
                "reviewText": "If your TV has 600mm by 400mm VESA pattern this mount will work - but only just!In an Amazon ad, they indicate that you can easily slide the mounted TV left or right to position it.True - about 1 inch or so left or right. That's all the wall plate rail will allow.Most wall studs are 16\" on center. The wall plate mounting rail is about 26\" wide.The brackets that attach to TV are about an inch wide - with 600mm spacing, that leaves very little space to adjust left or right.The location of your wall studs might not let you mount the wall plate AND slide the mounted TV far enough left or right to position it where you want it.The 400mm top to bottom VESA spacing requires you to attach the bracket bolts through the top hole in each. That means there is zero height adjustment once the wall plate is attached to the wall.If your TV uses 400mm or 200mm wide VESA spacing, you'll have that much more room to slide the TV left or right.If the top to bottom VESA is less than 400mm, you can attach the brackets to the TV using different bracket holes - so position the TV higher or lower, by remounting the brackets.The point is: with 600mm by 400mm VESA pattern, you have to make sure you have the wall plate exactly where you want it, in order to have the TV exactly where you want it.The mount arrived well packaged, complete and with no issues or emissions.In fact, it contained more parts than I expected - useful for the variables of any given application.I've seen some answers/reviews suggesting you could use this mount in cases other than those for which the maker has approved. Only do so if you have the experience and knowledge to be sure that it can be done safely.The kit does include spacers, which the instruction booklet says are for curved back sets, or where extra spacing from the wall is needed for connecting cables.Though my TV is flat backed, I used the spacers provided both for cable clearance and to provide a slight tilt angle for better viewing. I used the larger spacers on the bottom VESA bolts, and the larger and midsized spacers for the upper VESA bolts (which meant I used the largest bolts on top, and the medium length bolts at the bottom - providing a few degrees tilt.This is a non-tilting mount, but seeing how the supporting/connecting worked, I am confident that the result is secure.It is absolutely necessary that the wall plate is secured correctly to a solid wall structure - if in doubt, don't proceed.The unit construction is solid. The supplied wall mounting lag bolts pass through the drywall and nearly 3\" into the 2x4 studs. They say pre-drill with a 5mm bit - that's just about equal to 7/32\", and that worked fine.My recommendation is to have the TV face down on the floor or a table, and then \"dry fit\" the VESA mounting brackets to the back of the TV; and then \"trial fit\" the wall plate to the mounting brackets. Doing so, you'll get a good idea of how the system works (and see just how much sliding left or right you'll be able to do). You can also see where on your TV the wall plate will attach - and that's the only way you can measure and calculate where the wall plate SHOULD be positioned on the wall, so that the TV will be exactly where you want it to be.Yes, that's going to mean undoing and redoing some of the assembly; but as the saying goes \"measure twice, cut once\".Hope it helps.",
