Easy enough to install. Included were several choices of bolts to attach to the TV. I located a 2 x 4 stud closest to the location that I wanted, drilled the pilot holes and attached with the 3 bolts included for wood. (Does not include bolts for brick/concrete mounting) With the full motion, I currently have this placed in the corner and slightly tilted down. I can easily swing it out of the corner and flat against the wall if I change my mind. The mount is sturdy enough that I would attached a larger TV if I had one.",
