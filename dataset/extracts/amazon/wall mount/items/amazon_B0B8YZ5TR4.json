Please search for Perlegear PGUE1 TV Wall Mount Extension Bracket to install in 24\u2033 Max wood studs.",
            "Full Motion Flexibility: The 82 inch TV wall mount is designed with +5\u00b0/-15\u00b0 tilt (no tools needed) to reduce glare, +/-45\u00b0 swivel to direct the screen toward your position, and +/-3\u00b0 leveling to fine tune the TV's position after installation.",
            "Bring Your TV Closer: The large full motion TV mount can extend 16.5\" for viewing and retracts back to 2.9\" from the wall to save space for a low-profile look. The wall plate has openings to accommodate an electrical outlet on the wall.",
            "Easy to Install: The TV wall mount comes with a detailed instruction manual, mounting hardware, and drilling template to make installation as easy as possible. Simply attach the brackets to your TV, mount the arm assembly on the wall (12\u2033/16\u2033 wood studs, concrete, or brick), and then hang your TV. Please do not mount on drywall alone."

                "reviewText": "I chose this unit mainly based on the price, it's a great value if you can get it on sale. Pros: Very well made, nicely packaged and easy to assemble. Wide range of horizontal viewing angle adjustment. Hardware for TV, wall mounting and drilling template included. Cons: Maybe overly complicated and / or bulky for some installations if you have a small room with a smaller TV. Vertical tilt angle adjustment range is somewhat limited so this will also effect mounting height options. Overall I would definitely recommend this for a large room with a 50 inch or larger TV, especially if you want options to adjust viewing angle for different furniture arrangements in the future.UPDATE SEE PHOTO: Rather than compromise on TV placement I spanned across a void between studs by lag bolting perforated angle to the studs 36 inches on center on either side of a chimney behind the finished wall (didn't want to drill into the brick). I used 14 gauge 1 1/4 inch angle on top and 18 gauge 1 inch angle on the bottom about 38 inches long with 5/16 x 1 carriage bolts for attaching the mount. This allowed me to locate the TV where I wanted it and the added angles make it very rigid.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a very good product. I had actually purchased to install one TV and ended up installing on a different one. The template that's included is very helpful along with the installation video. The instructions are really, including letting you know what additional tools will be needed. Be sure you have a good stud finder and good drill to get your pilot holes started. This might be where you spend a bit of your time.I also liked the recommended, \"stress / tension test\" the instructions have you perform before mounting your TV.The TV braces are designed well and make it easy to take the TV down if needed.Some additional details specific to my TV.TV Type: Samsung w/recessed screw holes.Some Cons / areas that could be improved:1) Take extra care with the TV Braces as they have rough/sharp edges. As I learned the hard way by getting a nasty cut while making some adjustments.2) The spacers provided were of limited help. Fortunately, I had the original spacers that came with my TV and were a better option than the ones that came with this kit.3) This one is important. I'd recommend purchasing a separate installation hardware kit. The variety pack that this mounting kit ships with is nice but doesn't have everything. In my case the bolts/screws for the TV though were the right size however, they were either too long or not long enough. Fortunately, I had additional bolts from another hardware installation kit that were just the right fit.4) Lastly, this product ships with 4 Lag Screws that you use to secure the mount to the studs in your wall. For added support and safety, I ended purchasing some additional Lag Screws.All-in-all it's not a bad product for the price. I actually ended up purchasing the larger version of this product from the TV that I had originally intended to use this product with.",
