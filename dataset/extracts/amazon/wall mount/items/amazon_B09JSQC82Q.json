                "reviewText": "I like this. The style matches perfectly with mu natural 80\u2019s hard wood floors. Most importantly it is sturdy. I was able to fit my power cord inside and arrange the cords accordingly. What i did not like was that once all the cords were put in place the too did not fit snug. I messed around with it for a few seconds and as you can see the top lays flat but it doesn't feel secure. It is not thick enough to put my MacBook Pro power cord in there bit i was able to run the cord through and plug it into the wall. So i wasn't able to hide all my cords but there is still room should i need to plug up other things. No installation or directions needed. Easy self explanatory set up. I will be purchasing more.",

I did sorta wish the walls, the white plastic part was a little stronger\u2026 mainly cause the wooden lid popped off too easily - if the box was brushed even lightly, the lid would shift.As a perfectionist, it drove me a little nutz, but a little Scotch tape fixed everything!And I LOVE not seeing cords and charges all chaotic and crazy!!!",

                "reviewText": "If you want some lazy cable management at low cost, then this box will do the trick.You can't fit much in this box beyond a power strip and a few bunches of cables. The port hole is on top of the lid, which creates pressure against the lid from the cables. Any more than 3 cables exiting the top will prevent the top from closing. The lid itself is secured by pressure/friction with the sides of the box - not a secure closure mechanism and makes it a lot less versatile.I was eventually able to manage cables from a power strip, router/modem, laptop, and desk lamp in the box but getting the lid to stay closed required a lot of finagling.If you're budget is under 20USD, then I suppose this product works - however, there are better products at a slightly higher price.",
