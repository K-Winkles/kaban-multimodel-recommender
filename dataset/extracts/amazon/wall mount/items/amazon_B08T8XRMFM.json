                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Heavy Duty Fixed TV Wall Mount, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and reliability. This wall mount is an exceptional solution for securely mounting large, flat or curved TVs ranging from 42 to 100 inches. Allow me to share my experience with this outstanding product.First and foremost, the heavy-duty construction of this wall mount is outstanding. It is capable of supporting up to 264 pounds, providing a secure and sturdy foundation for my TV. The robust design ensures that my television remains safely in place, without any wobbling or risk of slippage. This level of durability and strength gives me peace of mind, knowing that my investment is well-protected.The versatility of this TV wall mount is noteworthy. It is compatible with a wide range of TV sizes, accommodating screens from 42 to 100 inches. The VESA compatibility of up to 800x600mm ensures that it fits most standard mounting patterns. Additionally, it is designed to fit 16-inch, 18-inch, and 24-inch studs, providing flexibility in installation options. This versatility makes it suitable for various room layouts and TV configurations.The low-profile design of this wall mount is a significant advantage. It allows my TV to sit close to the wall, creating a sleek and clean aesthetic. The space-saving feature is particularly beneficial for rooms with limited space or when I want to achieve a minimalist look. Despite the slim profile, the mount provides easy access to ports and cables, making adjustments and connections hassle-free.Installation of this wall mount was surprisingly straightforward.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this mount to install a TCL QM8 85\" TV. The TV weighs 100 lbs, which is less than half the capacity of the mount. the mount came will all the hardware and spacers needed including several screw sizes to mount the TV, and four large lag bolts for the wall portion of the mount.There are plenty of slots and holes on both portions of the mount to adapt to a variety of TV's and wall stud locations.Even though the stand is not seen, the finish is very nice. There were no sharp corners, and the textured black paint is nice.This is a fixed wall mount stand, so don't expect a lot of access to the rear of the TV once it's mounted. I connected the wires beforehand and then installed the TV. You can pull the two release loops and pull the bottom of the TV away from the wall to provide about 6 inches of access.The mount is low profile, so it provides a nice final installation that's close the wall. Once installed, the TV feels very secure.As mounted, my TCL QM8 TV is canted very slightly forward. This is more a factor of the TV than the stand. I could correct this with the spacers provided, but chose to leave it as is since it's very slight and seems better directed at the viewing area.It's an excellent stand for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a wall mount that would work on an older tv where the brackets are roughly 29\u201d apart. After buying two different wall mounts which said they could support a tv up to 84\u201d (mine is 65\u201d) I realized that I needed a mount with a wider plate. This mount was l perfect and fit my tv. It\u2019s built very well and can accommodate older TVs and support a heavier tv without a problem. It was everything I hoped for and would absolutely buy it again and recommend to anyone looking for a well built wall mount. It was also super easy to install, and I\u2019m not exactly a guru when it comes to this type of thing. I had it installed in 15 minutes. It came with heavy duty bolts too. Thank you for accommodating what I needed!",

                "reviewText": "I used this to mount my 85\" Samsung. Overall very sturdy and feels solid when mounted. It could take a lot more weight if needed. Not sure the studs could but the mount could. It is very low profile. That is what I wanted since my TV is mounted on a wall were you can see it from the side. I didn't want to see cables or anything. One side effect is it is too tight to plug cable in so do it as you mount it. Had to give it 4 out of 5 due to the only weak spot on the mount. The safety latches on the arms that keep it locked onto the wall mount could be better. They hold fine however the latch assembly are the only plastic parts. Held on by one little screw each and a plastic nub on the other end. It doesn't take much force at all to snap them off. Now this isn't going to make the tv fall but it wasn't too comforting. I ended up super gluing both in place. Even with that flaw I would probably buy it again.",
