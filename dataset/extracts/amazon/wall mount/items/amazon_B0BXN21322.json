Ended up tightening not just the 2 bolts your supposed to, but also the 2 other \"hinge point\" bolts that are on each side. You will not be able to adjust the tilt just by the top bolt if you do this. Product needs to go back to the engineering department.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I wanted a slim as possible mount behind my pretty thick fire tv and have an antique house with unusual stud spacing. BLUF it works pretty well but I had to jettison one of the extensions that make it reach 24\u201d stud spacing. Would\u2019ve been nice if they had been more adjustable.My main compliant w this product is the tilt mechanism does not lock into the desired place well and slips a bit. I can\u2019t get it to stay exactly where I want. It uses two Allen wrench screws and just sheer tension to stay in place but the screws aren\u2019t strong enough. If I crank on them anymore I\u2019ll strip them. Tv wants to fall forward so I\u2019ll try at a later date to see if a I can adjust the brackets on the back of tv to reduce the center of gravity.Also be forewarned, this does not have a level adjustment so get your level right with the template. I spent an exhaustive amount of time dealing with confirming stud locations and level esa but the quirks in my antique house still make the tv seem a bit off.",

                "reviewText": "Not bad, at a discounted price. If you are handy, it will need some simple fiddling to get it right, but it is possible.As some reviewers have mentioned, the tilt needs some work. The manual does not mention it, but there are other larger bolts, which support the tilt function, that just need simple tightening to hold. I don\u2019t plan to use the tilt feature, so I just tightened the bolts so the mount does not tilt. If you need tilt, just tighten the lower bolts enough and use the two smaller tilt screws mentioned in the manual.For the full asking price, I feel the top support bar should be one solid piece for maximum support, it requires assembly with a split in the middle. It will technically hold the weight of the TV, but not the better design, as well as the plastic vertical brackets, could lead to some leveling issues if the mount is extended.For my use case, the main selling point is the ultra-slim-close-to-wall design, for a full motion mount. It is fairly easy to make this mount work, if you are handy. I don\u2019t plan to use the tilt or pull away from the wall (comes in handy to get behind the TV and install cables, then fold the mount in flat to the wall).",
