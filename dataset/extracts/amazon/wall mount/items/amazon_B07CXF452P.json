                "reviewText": "The mount is well made. The installation instructions are pretty thorough and the installation is straightforward and easy. I am very happy with this product. I liked it enough to buy a second one.I would REALLY REALLY REALLY like to give it 5 stars.Unfortunately, I have to dock it a star.I made the mistake of starting to install the mount without making sure that all of its parts were in the box. Alas... I was close to finishing the installation when I discovered that a needed part was nowhere to be found. Not the best time for this to happen, half of it was already bolted to the wall. Disappointed? Yes. But these things happen. Things can slip through the QA cracks. As long as their customer service can rectify the situation, I'm still a happy customer.I look through the documents in the box for the customer service information. Turns out that I was 20 minutes past the hours that they were open to take phone calls. But they did have an email address! Yay me! I sent them a quick email about the missing part, and figured that at the earliest that I would get a reply from them would be the next day or more likely many days later. To my surprise, an hour or so later, they emailed me back requesting some more info \ud83d\ude00. It only took a couple of emails and they agreed to send a new part. At this point, I'm a super happy camper. Everything was handled by customer service in one evening. KUDOS to the people in the customer service department!The next day, I decided to order another of the same mount for another TV. After all, I like the mount, and I was impressed with how their customer service responded to my problem. That day I also received a notice that a shipping label was produced to ship my part! Again, yay for me!Here's where they loose the star.I received the 2nd mount that I ordered that same day! I made sure that it included all the parts that it was supposed to have, and it did. So I took the part that I needed, and used it to finish installing the 1st mount. Set the 2nd mount aside and waited for the replacement part to come in so that I could install the 2nd mount.So far, I'm happy as a clam. But then it took nearly TWO WEEKS for the part to leave the shipper! I have no way of knowing whether it was their shipping department or USPS dropped the ball at this point. A miscommunication between the shipper and USPS, or something else. What I do know is that the shipping department didn't feel the need to let me know that there would be a delay.If not for me ordering a 2nd mount and it arriving very quickly, I would have been stuck with having half of a TV mount bolted to my living room wall and my TV sitting on my couch. That would have blown monkey nuts.Quality of TV mount: 5 starsCustomer service: 5 starsWhoever in their shipping department that took nearly 2 weeks to send the part: not 5 stars and the employees in customer service should mock him or her.I would only dock them a half star, but there's no option for that. If I need a 3rd TV mount, I will buy it from them.",

                "reviewText": "So, I'll just get into the pros and cons.Pros:1. This mount is made of high quality materials and it very heavy and durable.2. The TV sits pretty flat on the wall.3. Comes with every piece of hardware that you should need.4. It comes with a template that is very useful and makes mounting way easier.5. Great instructions. Easy to understand and follow.6. You can move this mount around very easily, if you need to.Cons:1. The mount is kind of confusing to adjust (tilt), but once you figure it out, you'll be fine.2. See picture 2. This mount could stand to be 2-3 inches in width. This will help if the joists aren't true. I figured out the hard way that mine weren't. I ended up using flat stock with holes to extend the mount (not recommending anybody to do this, but I'm pretty handy and confident that the mount is secure to the wall).Overall, I give the mount a 4.8/5 and that just because of the modifications that I had to do, so that I could use it.",
