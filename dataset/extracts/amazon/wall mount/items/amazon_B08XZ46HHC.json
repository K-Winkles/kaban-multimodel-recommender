The up and down movement is strong and easy. The left/right is very easy. The looking downward and upward slant movement is semi-fixed, though, and requires a wrench tool to move or adjust. I wish that wasn\u2019t needed, but that is not a deal breaker. I will say, EVERYTHING you need to install is included and if you can read English and take your time, this was super easy to install. There were so many details and explanations, to make it fool-proof, I was intimidated, but I guess the company needed to add those to make people actually pay attention. It is super strong and well made. I\u2019m glad I got it and love being able to change the look of the room/view with a simple motion.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived quick and works great. Used 3 for my home work desk. One 43 inch 4k monitor and two 27 4k monitor. 43 was purfect. One 27 was purfect. The other 27 was very offset on the Vesa mounts that the mounting plate stuck out a little on the top and I had to add my own holes. Needed to redece the tension 4-5 complete turns so don't be shy on this aspect until it is easy to move. Love the extra space from desk top stands on monitors. Very sturdy and lots of adjustability.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to use my living room TV so that I could swivel and adjust to point it toward the kitchen. The range of motion is not as wide as they would have you believe. The up and down is very minimal and all movement is difficult. The mount is not sturdy and my tv is well below the max limits indicated. The mount is very difficult to move at the joints and the gas spring is not holding the tv up well at all. It keeps falling ever so slowly back down. If I try to swivel it, the tv moves lower. There is even play where the tv will rotate, despite this not happening where the screws are placed to allow rotation for installation. It was just wobbly and unsteady. It did not live up to my expectations at all. Also, it's absurd to not include one tool for all adjustments. It has an included socket type tool (that was awkward to use) for the gas spring, while the tilt function and the stiff joint in the middle can't be adjusted with the same tool. I'm not sure the joint can be adjusted at all. I will be returning it to replace with the same brand in my other room. The price difference is worth getting a better mount in my opinion, as this is not easy to use and adjust.",

The up and down does take a bit of force to move and you do need to securely mount this into a wall stud with the mounting system, but I think it works well and is a great solution for the price if you need something you can move around.It's used for a TV that can be adjusted between a couch and a treadmill, so it can be moved around to be visible for someone in either location and it works quite well for that.",
