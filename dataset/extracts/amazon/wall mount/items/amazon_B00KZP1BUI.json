                "reviewText": "Pros: Sturdy, affordable, simple, easy to set upCons: Limited adjustment, not perfectly flush to wall (it's hard to call these cons because the product is obviously not intended to have tons of adjustment or be a perfectly flush mount)I bought two of these to mount a 27\" monitor each. I was a little concerned that they wouldn't be sturdy enough and might wobble under the weight of the monitor but after mounting them I and using them for a few months I'm quite pleased.The plate that mounts to the wall is large and feels very stable. The mount that attaches to the back of the monitor is simple and stable as well. There is a small rubber bushing that allows for smooth left to right movement which can also be adjusted to be made stiffer or looser. This has been a source of weakness in other mounts I've owned and this one feels sturdy without any wobble or slop.There is a fairly limited range of motion for the up and down tilt so I'd suggest mounting this right at eye level or only slightly above. If you mount it too high you won't have the adjustment needed to tilt the screen down to a comfortable viewing angle. This is what I expected and I ultimately never use that tilt feature.After you mount the bracket to the wall and the back plate to the monitor it is a little cramped behind the screen when putting the monitor onto the wall bracket but the design is simple and makes it relatively easy. I like how the mount is relatively flush to the wall but it is by no means perfectly flush. So if that's what you're looking for then keep looking.The bolts that actually hold the monitor bracket to the wall bracket are a good size. I've seen brackets with little tiny mounting bolts that seemed questionable as far as strength. This feels very solid.I would definitely buy this again if I needed a sturdy, affordable, semi-flush mount with the basic range of adjustments.I would not buy this if I wanted something with lots of articulation and adjustments to be able to fully control the viewing angle. This is not that product.",

                "reviewText": "Its odd reading the reviews that complain about this mount not working with whatever size monitor -when its based on the weight of the monitor not the size.The 100mm mounting worked perfectly for my 24\" monitor and needed the washers due to the curve on the back of the monitor. It's worth pointing out that the screws are just the right length, having them too long can cause them to short out on the internal components of the monitor which isn't good.This mount is designed for installation into a 2x4 or concrete/brick wall and is really easy to install.",

I wanted my monitors flat (as much as you can) up against the wall, and this was perfect!You have some motion to rock the monitor left or right and also tilt it up or down. But, this bracket will not allow you to rotate your screen or raise lower it. Basically, once you mount the bracket, that is where your monitor will be. That was what I was expecting and totally fine for me. It would also cost 10x more with those features!",
