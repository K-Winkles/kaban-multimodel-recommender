                "reviewText": "This is a nice, heavy full motion tv mount. We mounted our 65\" Samsung TV above our brick fireplace, and it completely changed the look and feel of our living room in a positive way.One really nice touch is that they provide plenty of hardware options and spacers to put the brackets on various TVs, and it's simple to follow the included well-written instructions.The instructions were also very clear as far as mounting to studs, concrete blocks, or brick. We used a hammer drill to drill the pilot holes, using the paper template as a guide, tapped the anchors into the pilot holes, and used our crescent wrench to attach the mount to the brick. From there we hung the tv on the mount, tightened the bottom screws, and adjusted the angle. It is excellent, and looks good in our room.The one thing that I wish is that the wall bracket was a little bit wider. You've got to hang the TV almost exactly perfectly within maybe a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch, or you'll be \"off\" on one side - so make sure you've got some help to ensure you're secure on both sides before you the TV go.For the price, quality, sturdiness, versatility, and performance, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Same-day arrival from Amazon was amazing too!",

                "reviewText": "I watched several video reviews of TV wall mounts before buying this one. The key is making sure the wall frame will align with the wall studs at a location that you want your TV to be mounted. I would recommend checking your wall, finding and marking the stud locations before purchasing. The mount kit was complete, instructions were easy to follow. You will probably need an extra person for mounting the bracket to the wall and installing the TV to the mount. Othewise, the product is well built, good quality and range of motion. It easily handles the 55-inch flat screen TV I mounted on it. Recommended, but do your homework first to make sure it will fit where you want to mount it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nicely made, but falls a little short",
                "reviewText": "The mount came with all parts required for the installation. Everything was laid out well and the instructions showed various types of installs. They don't talk about height measurements, etc., but this wasn't my first mount installation, so I took my time and it came out good. The only major complaint and issue is that they make the mounting plate for the wall and TV exactly 17 inches, which will only fit a 16\" wide mounting. If my studs were not in the right places so that the TV will hang even side to side, I'd be in trouble and the mount would have to be returned. So, if you need to slide the TV over an inch or two to center it on your wall, you're SOL. I haven't hung the TV yet, but that's simple. Once again, the front plate that the TV will hang on is for a 16\" wide span. You can't move the TV a 1/2 inch or it will fall off the front mounting plate. If they simply would have made the mounting plates 3-4 inches wider, this would have gotten 5 stars. The exact fixed widths, limit your installation options. If your studs aren't exactly lined up so your TV is centered, you will have to install horizontal beams on the wall so the mount can be moved off the stud centerlines. I don't think most people want to see 2x4's hanging on their wall behind the TV. The price was right and the overall quality is good, but beware of the limitations.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Samsung 32inch, model #UN32J4000. This mount does fit my TV but it's at the most minimal adjustment settings. The height of my TV is 17in. The brackets of the tv mount are exactly 17in. The wall plate is much smaller than my tv, so it does hide behind, like the brackets do. I wish it was a closer profile to the wall when extending arms are collapsed. The kit did not come with a level as shown in the pictures. I used my own. The mounting stencil was helpful.I needed M8 30mm-35mm screws for my tv. The kit only has 2 types of M8 Screws, 25mm and 50mm. If you need M6 screws, the kit only has 15mm and 35mm sets; and M4 screws..only 12mm and 40mm. Best check what screws your model has. The instructions were not hard for me to follow, I just didn't have a socket rench handy. After buying a sale priced socket set, I was able to install the 5/16\" bolts to secure the wall plate with a 3/8\" ratchet, whereas the instructions state you need a 1/2\" for wood stud installation. Either will work, so long as you do drill a pilot hole with the exact drill bit they specify to use for the wall type you are using. Again, I had to buy the 7/32\" drill bit by itself as mine were a size too small or too big.Did I enjoy the experience of installing this mount? No, however it is manageable.Is the quality reliable and worth 4.5+ stars? Yes.Does this kit seem less efficient than I expected? Yes. I knew going in, somewhere it did say it will fit \"most\" TVs within the range stated, so I anticipated I may need to buy extra materials. My main critique is the higher profile out from the wall than I'd like it to be. I would have gone for the one arm extender version but my apartment building has my studs situated so that the tv mount must be installed using two studs (mine are 16in apart). Therefore I had to buy this one. Part of me wishes I went with the Mounting Dream brand but I've already done all this work.Glimpse of the instruction manual attached. May update review with a picture once it's fully installed.",
