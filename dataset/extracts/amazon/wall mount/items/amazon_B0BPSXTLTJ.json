As for the kit itself, all the necessary hardware for various home mounting scenarios was included, and this is a very sturdy product. I stud mounted our 70\" Samsung TV in less than 20 minutes using a stud finder and drill driver. Excellent experience.",

                "reviewText": "As the headline states, I bought this for my new office TV, a 75\" Hisense U7K, and it works well. It doesn't seem as solidly built as a lot of my older mounts, but flat TVs have gotten a LOT lighter over the years, so thicker metal probably isn't as important as it used to be. I will confirm that it seems to be able to be placed on 24\" on-center studs, if needed, but I mounted it on 16\" on-center studs. Once the TV was mounted on the frame, I was able to easily slide the TV from left to right several inches to center it on the wall.The only nitpick was that because of the 400 x 400 Vesa mounting holes on the TV, I didn't have any up/down alignment options, which just required some simple measuring for accurate wall placement. Additionally, because of the required 400 x 400 low mount placement, the bottom hooks' release straps hung below the TV, but I just pulled them toward each other and ziptied them together, and now they can't be seen and I can also pull them both down simultaneously with one hand to release the bottom hooks.Because of the narrow area where I mounted the TV, I didn't need side-to-side articulation of the mount, but thought I might need options for tilt angle adjustment. It turns out that it looked best to me at its chosen height, in my particular space, at a completely flat angle, so tilt angle adjustment was a non-issue. But, as a note, adjusting the tilt angle of the mount, which I didn't actually do, absolutely requires either choosing and locking the angle into place before mounting the TV to the frame, or taking the TV back down to adjust after initial mounting. I've had other mounts which allowed me to adjust the tilt angle while the TV was still mounted by using locking spring-loaded pins on both sides, which is definitely preferable. Additionally, the way the angle is set and locked into place is by tightening two screws on each side into two rounded available slots on each side (so four total screws in four total slots, with two screws facing inward and two screws facing outward). And, without any way to lock them into place besides screw tension, it doesn't seem like the most solid, accurate, or long-lasting way to do it. But, for me, who just needed a cheap, flat mount without any side-to-side articulation or tilt angle adjustment, this mount worked perfectly well.",

I love that I can tilt it if I want to but ultimately I just wanted it mounted straight on the wall and it got the job done just perfectly. Was t hard to I stall and it even comes with a template so you can measure, mark and put the bolts exactly where you need them. Takes the guess work out!",

                "reviewText": "Used for an LG C65 - nothing fancy, but a sturdy wall mount that allows sliding to better position when using studs (best way for most). Tilting is very limited, but useful for final position where window glare may be an issue. For the price, would be hard to beat. As with all surface wall mounts, it does make the TV not flush to the wall. For safety, two people are needed for final lift of TV to mount. Again, quality and price is excellent.",
