                "reviewText": "I decided on this mount because my old one had too much flexibility in the up and down movement, every time I moved the television it would feel like I was about to rip it off the wall. The installation is pretty straight forward, given the weight you will need to find a wall stud to secure the mount to the wall which is what the instructions state. I was able to use several zip T-anchors each holding 100 pounds to secure to the drywall (not recommended by manufacturer) since the wall stud position was too far from where I needed to mount my television. I love that it comes with both a tiny bubble level as well as cable ties so you can make sure it is level and the cables are clean with nothing hanging randomly behind the television. Overall I like this mount, wish it was lighter but I have no concerns about the quality.",

It's easy to move into the spot you want, but just stiff enough that it holds firmly in place wherever it's positioned. The brackets fit a wide range of TV sizes.The size of the mounting bracket fits on a single stud without having to span between multiples which makes it incredibly versatile... It can even be mounted in the corner!",
