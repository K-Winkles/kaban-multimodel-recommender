I probably just have control issues. :) it smells nice not over powering like lilac lavender hillside spring unicorn rose garden spring fresh freshness that last 16 years coating your clothes in gawd knows what. Just a nice simple clean smell.I don't have a lot of needs to remove ketchup stains, mud clots, heavy machinery grease or a hoodlums blood. All though I'm sure this detergent could. My laundry needs are much simpler. But, I put this soap with some clorox 2 and wow! That's all I can say. I like it better than tide which I think is overrated anyways. Give it a try!",
