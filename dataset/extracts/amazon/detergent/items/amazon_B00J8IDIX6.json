Great product, I will definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot express enough how thrilled I am with Soak Laundry Soap! As someone who frequently hand washes delicate items, I've finally found a product that makes the process not only efficient but also incredibly pleasant.The Fig scent is *divine* and providing a subtle, refreshing aroma that lingers on my clothes without overwhelming them. It's a small touch that brings joy to the laundry routine.What truly sets Soak apart is its no-rinse formula. I simply soak my delicates, gently agitate, and let the magic happen. The soap effectively cleans and refreshes my clothes without any harsh chemicals or the need for a rinse cycle. It's eco-friendly and saves water \u2013 a win-win!The convenience of the squeeze bottle is an added bonus. It makes measuring and dispensing the right amount of product a breeze. Plus, the packaging is not only functional but also visually appealing.Soak Laundry Soap has proven its worth with each use. My delicates retained their integrity and softness. No more worrying about wear, tears, and pilling from the washing machine!For anyone seeking a gentle yet highly effective hand wash detergent, Soak is the way to go. I wholeheartedly recommend Soak Laundry Soap's Fig scent.",

                "reviewText": "As a hand knitter, blocking is an important technique in getting your hand knitted items into a desired shape by redistributing the stitches, without stretching it out or damaging the fibers. Plain water can be used for this purpose but to keep the natural fibers soft and to preserve the natural lanolin oils found in theses fibers, a wool wash is more efficient.I have purchased and used this item, along with Wrapture - Jasmine Large 16.9 Oz and The Laundress Wool & Cashmere Shampoo, Cedar, 16 fl. oz. \u2013 32 loads .Here is my comparison of all three items:1. Eucalan Delicate Wash Wrapture \u2013 JasmineThis is a no rinse wash that contains a touch of lanolin to naturally condition fibers. I used this wash on several Lopapeysas that I hand knitted with scratchy Icelandic wool. I simply poured about 2 capfuls per gallon of cold water and let the sweater sit overnight. I squeezed it out and laid flat to dry (on a blocking mat) the next day (shaping if necessary).This wash was perfect in softening the wool and gave it a light jasmine scent. Grade A+2. The Laundress New York Wool and Cashmere Shampoo \u2013 CedarThis is a highly concentrated wool and cashmere shampoo that contains lanolin and cedar extracts. I also used this wash on hand knitted Lopapeysas and a fisherman\u2019s sweater for my husband. I did the same process using about 2 capfuls per gallon of cold water and let the sweater sit overnight, however, this shampoo (it\u2019s sudsy and soapy), requires rinsing. I rinsed with cold water until it ran clear then squeezed it out and laid flat to dry (on a blocking mat) the next day (shaping if necessary).I also recommend this shampoo for washing (cleaning) wool items that have been soiled or sweaty. It works wonderfully on my husband and children\u2019s ski wool items and base layers.This wash was perfect in softening the wool and giving it a lovely cedar \u201cwoodsy\u201d smell that is perfect for the \u201cmanly\u201d man yet still subtle and feminine for the \u201cgirly\u201d girl! Grade A+3. Soak Wash for Hand Knits \u2013 ScentlessThis is a gentle no rinse formula that\u2019s phosphate free and perfect for people with sensitive skin or sensitive noses! I use this for all my hand knitted baby and children\u2019s items (form socks and hats to sweaters and blankets) and hand knitted items I give as gifts. I think this one would be perfect for other delicate items such as lingerie.I follow the same method, as with the other washes (soak, squeeze and rinse, lay flat to dry).This wash was perfect in providing the softness without the fragrance! Grade A+NoteI cannot comment on how any of these washes/shampoos preform on machine washed items as I\u2019ve only done them by hand.None of my items have shrunk using any of the above washes/shampoos.I highly recommend any of the above three for your wool, cashmere, or natural fiber items!",

                "reviewText": "Like many others have said, this stuff cleans really well. I mean, the water that my bras came out of looked like the swamp. And I know some detergents cloud up the water on their own, but this stuff leaves the water clear, so I know it was ALL DIRT. So I DID rinse my clothes. Works well and easy to measure, i just put it into a spoon and swish the spoon into my basin.My only complaint is that the scent turned out differently than expected. I'm a citrus lover, I really wanted to like the Yuzu, but the smell is more \"sweet\" to me than \"Clean with a peel\" like it says on the bottle, so I feel like they should have described it differently. It is a very sweet fruity scent. It's pleasant while you're washing, but I'm not sure I like having it linger in my clothes. I'm ordering the mint this time and giving the Yuzu to a friend.",
