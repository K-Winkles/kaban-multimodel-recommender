                "reviewText": "As someone who has always been conscious of stretching their budget, I've often opted for cheaper laundry detergent brands in the past. However, my perception of premium brands like Tide Pods has completely shifted after trying them out. Let me tell you, they are worth every penny!Tide Pods have proven themselves to be an excellent investment, especially for someone like me who aims to save wherever possible. The first thing that caught my attention was their convenience. The pre-measured pods eliminate the need for measuring cups, making laundry a breeze. It also prevents any wastage, ensuring I use just the right amount for each load, which helps maximize the value of every purchase.But the real magic of Tide Pods lies in their exceptional cleaning power. Even with cheaper brands, I used to resign certain stained or soiled clothes to a life of being relegated to cleaning duties around the house. However, with Tide Pods, I've noticed an incredible difference. If I accidentally spill some of the detergent on my clothes, I don't panic anymore! Throwing the affected garment into the wash with a Tide Pod has consistently saved the article of clothing.In the past, I'd often experience fading, fabric damage, or stubborn stains that wouldn't budge with cheaper detergents. But Tide Pods have been a game-changer in this regard. Not only have they successfully removed tough stains, but they've also helped maintain the quality of my clothes over time. The colors stay vibrant, the fabric remains soft, and I've noticed far less wear and tear compared to when I used budget detergents.I appreciate the reliability of Tide Pods; I can confidently use them on all types of fabrics without worrying about potential damage. They have proven to be gentle on delicate items and tough on stains, making them a versatile choice for all my laundry needs.While some may argue that Tide Pods are more expensive than other brands, the money I save by not having to replace damaged clothes offsets the cost. With cheaper alternatives, I ended up spending more in the long run due to the need for constant fabric replacements. So, the investment in Tide Pods not only preserves my clothes but also keeps my wallet happy in the long term.In conclusion, as a self-proclaimed tightwad, Tide Pods have changed the way I do laundry. The peace of mind they provide, knowing that my clothes will be well taken care of and that stubborn stains don't stand a chance, makes them worth every penny. If you're looking for a premium laundry detergent that saves your clothes and your budget in the long run, Tide Pods are definitely the way to go!",

                "reviewText": "I only ever use Tide Pods. More specifically, I only ever use these ones. I don't think other detergents clean clothes well, nor do they make them smell nice. These do. Not only is this a large quantity that you're buying, these pods are very large. After having these, the small ones just don't suffice for me anymore. I feel more secure using the specific pods. They are truly heavy duty and clean your clothes very well, no matter the size of the wash load. Spring Meadows is also the only scent that I use. It smells fresh and clean. I always worry that any detergent I use won't clean my clothes and will leave my clothes smelling funky throughout the day while I use them. But these Tide Pods protect me from that. After many uses, I'm absolutely confident in the cleanliness and quality these provide.Also, I have eczema and highly sensitive skin. It's very hard to find lotions, soaps, serums, detergents, etc for my skin because my skin reacts so easily. Not once have I ever reacted to these. I've used these so many times and, still, my skin does not react.If you haven't used these, I HIGHLY recommend it. As long as they continue to make these, I will always buy this particular pod.",

In recent uses, I was mildly allergic to the detergent and would develop an annoying itch but with this one, I do not. The smell is wonderful and lasting. The pods are twice the size of regular pods so I feel like my laundry is getting the amount of soap it deserves with just one pod.They seem to last longer than the regular sized pods I was purchasing before. I am having zero issue with any allergies to this product and am super satisfied with the results I have gotten while using the Tide Hygienic Pods. I have tries another scent in this and its great too.",
