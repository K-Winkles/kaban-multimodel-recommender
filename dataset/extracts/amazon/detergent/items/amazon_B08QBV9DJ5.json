                "reviewText": "If you find this helpful please click the helpful button below :)I agree with the original review reposted below.I have actually tried persil and I do not prefer its scent and for some reason whenever I use it, one of my family member\u2019s allergies acts up.I have been using Tide for decades and have tried just about every other brand out there..I average a 3 load weekend which is when we do the laundry. And everything from whites to colors to delicate fabrics retain their bright colors and there is no damage to delicates.Tide is the clear winner based on value and performance for value..For whatever reason, nothing beats Tide and the Tide stain remover stick for stains. I thin they use some enzyme formula that really seams to work!I don\u2019t use the powder or PODS as a couple times they only partially dissolved and the powder seems to gunk up my washer lint filter. The liquid is the best for me!I also like the spout as it is dribble proof.Possible modifications: . Change out the design of the container..to fun seasonal colors.ORIGINAL REVIEWUpdated review November 19, 2003:The ONLY detergent that gets out tough stains better than this stuff is Persil. And the difference is very very very small. So small I miight even be just umagining there is a difference when there is none really. I have seen a study that said Persil is 2% better so, I might be influenced by that study. Tide is the clear winner based on value and performance for value..Original July 29 review:The container I received is about 3/4 full.OK, so I've used Tide PODS for a long time and I admit this is the first time I've ever bought the liquid jug. So, maybe the jug is supposed to come 3/4 full. But if that is so, it's a waste of plastic, since its not like a powdered product which \"settles\" during shipping..I average 4.5 loads a week. So, this Tide should last me somewhere between 8 to 16 weeks. Again, I am keeping a log. I will come back and update this message when the container is finished.For Sensitive Skin: 5I've never had a problem with Tide, nor has anybody I've ever known.",
