                "reviewText": "I was scouring the internet for a great baby detergent pod that had a good scent but was not too strong. When I came across this one I figured I would give it a try. I received it quickly and started using it right away.Pros: It is gentle on the clothing and has a very nice subtle scent that keeps her clothing smelling nice and fresh. I love that they are pods as it is much easier and less messy then most of the baby liquid detergent. You can buy the same scent in a dryer sheet which I went ahead and did to stick with one brand.Cons: I don\u2019t have any cons myself for this product but if you do not like scented stuff and prefer y scented then I would say look else where.",

The smell is fantastic.Positives: Smell, easy on daughter's skinNegatives: Smell doesn't linger, does not get out stainsLike another reviewer, I help the pod dissolve by pouring a little water on it before I shut the washer. I also put it right under where the water comes out. Does that mean the pod doesn't dissolve? No, not necessarily, but every now and then I would end up with chunks in the washer when unloading, so this guarantees this doesn't happen. I switched to these when my daughter was young and had issues with eczema. It definitely helped keep the irritation down. Plus no chemicals one of the competitors has. They definitely do nothing for food that gets on the shirts. I have to pretreat with Shout or other pretreater in order to get them out.",
