I put the sheets in a reusable metal container with a lid, and it looks so much nicer than huge bottles of detergent that drip and whatnot. This is a super sustainable option, as the lack of water within the product means you\u2019re only paying for and shipping the actual soap, not just water and packaging. Have been using these sheets for about 2 years and I love them!",

                "reviewText": "My skin is literally the worst. It\u2019s so sensitive that if I use the wrong detergent I will have hives FOR DAYS (even after showering and re-washing my clothes in the detergent I know works). I live in a somewhat remote area, so if my local grocery store runs out of detergent I\u2019m pretty screwed.Took a chance on these sheets and what do you know, THEY ARE AWESOME. I waited until I was almost done with the box to write a review for the sake of accuracy.Here are some straight facts:- I bought the box in August 2023, and I still have about a month\u2019s supply left.- I do somewhere between four to five loads of laundry every week.- Following the directions regarding how many sheets to use worked super well for me. They dissolve fast and don\u2019t leave residue. So they can also work for those who have a washer/dryer combo machine.- I bought the citrus-scented sheets and my obnoxiously sensitive skin is perfectly happy. The scent is very light but leaves your clothes funk-free.- I love how easy the sheets are to use and that I\u2019ve been able to eliminate the need for big plastic detergent jugs (being eco-friendly is punk rock!!).- I\u2019ve saved a ton of money by using this stuff!!! And in this wretched economy, that\u2019s pretty legit.So if you\u2019re looking for a good alternative to liquid detergent or pods, need something for your sensitive meat suit cover, or you just want to be punk rock, I highly recommend.",
