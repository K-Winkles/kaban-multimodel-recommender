It might seem a little expensive, but I love the way it does not smell at all, is made of fairly clean ingredients, and does not use plastic. And I used the washer sheets for a while but was less happy with those - they never seemed to work well and I would use two or three at a time: very expensive. I am overall very happy with it and will keep getting it!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m loving this detergent so far and have purchased Clean Cult in another scent also. The scent is not as strong as you may get from some of the mainstream detergent brands but you are avoiding the micro plastics and carcinogens that you get with those brands while still cleaning your clothes. I feel safer using Clean Cult and feel better about the impact on the environment by avoiding the big brands and will stick with Clean Cult from now on. I do think there may be some better packaging options out there though that are recyclable since in my area, as I\u2019m guessing in many others, this wax-coated cardboard, is not recyclable. But it\u2019s still better than a giant plastic tub. Also, it\u2019s very thick and concentrated as you\u2019re not buying the added water so the packages are small. It does pour more like molasses than the watery detergent you may be used to but this is a good thing!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this for a month now. If you use the right amount it is relatively economical and does the job. I even tested it on a soy sauce stain and it came out completely with a regular washing. The scent is interesting--as others have said an imitation lemon smell--however, if you thoroughly dry the items in a dryer, the smell goes away. I like to hang somethings to dry in the nicer weather and those things retain some of that odd scent. I bought the glass container sold for this product, and it makes it easy to measure the correct quantity and is not messy, like pouring from the carton would be. And I appreciate the lower waste aspect of the packaging. All in all, I like it, just not quite enough for the fifth star because of the residual smell if things aren't thoroughly dried.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this products and I had heard many wonderful things regarding clean cult. I\u2019m sure the unscented one is great, the performance\u2026. It works great. It\u2019s very cost-effective as you get a lot of product for a decent price but the specific smell let me tell you, maybe avoid it. I like that this product is nontoxic and made with clean ingredients but I just can\u2019t get over the smell. The sandalwood I normally love but in this product it smells like straight dirt when you wash your clothes. ;( I\u2019ve used it already a couple times thinking that maybe I would get used to it, but it still smells reminiscent of when you leave your laundry in the washer for too long and then throw it in the dryer\u2026. GROSS. Always happens too, I always switch my laundry on time and never leave for too long all the loads washed with this smelled this way. even after I dry I normally like to use lavender essential oils on my wool dryer balls in the dryer for my scent, but I thought I would try a recommended scent because it had decent reviews. I wish I would\u2019ve just bought unscented. ;( I went back to molly suds! Love it.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used everything from target & Walmart, along with Hex, and a couple enzyme detergents from big box stores (yes, I used a lot of oxiclean too). I still have my fingers crossed, as humidity has a way of bringing life back to odors I thought I\u2019d chased away, but I think this is the one. It feels like peak adulthood to find \u201cthe laundry detergent\u201d. It doesn\u2019t offend my skin (hi, easily offended). Washes out dog, teen, workout, night sweats, man. It smells really nice, even though it claims to smell like a balmy summer night, which sounds awful. I use it with Dirty Labs powder enzymes. Have I ever tried DL detergent? No. If you must know why, it\u2019s bc I shop online in the dead of night when I\u2019ve decided that tomorrow I\u2019ll change everyone\u2019s life with a new product, gadget, or service, and nighttime me has never wanted DL detergent, so it has never arrived on my doorstep. I am at her mercy.",
