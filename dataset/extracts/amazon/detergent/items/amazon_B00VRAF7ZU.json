Thought it could be the Bounce fabric softener but heard about the new Tide Free and Gentle. After the first couple of washes the itching was gone and never came back...so impressed, something that works! Didn't want to have to change detergents since Tide cleans so well as far as I'm concerned. Just wish we could buy the pods in a box or bag instead of the big plastic jug, trying to get rid of all this plastic. But product is great!",

                "reviewText": "I got the Free & Gentle Tide in liquid form, but I need to lug it into the laundry room, pour it out and measure it. This is handy-dandy and small. Easy to carry. I just throw one in each load, even if they are pretty dirty (smelly socks from hiking, for example). The detergent works great and, like the liquid form, it does not irritate my very sensitive skin (runs in my family...we are all are blessed with very reactive skin and all use unscented laundry detergent). My clothes do seem fresh. I often wash in cold and hang up my clothes to have them last. Only towels and sheets go into the dryer for me. Pro-tip - put the pod on the bottom of your clothes in the HE wash machines. Works much better and dissolves all the way each time for me.",

                "reviewText": "We were using Liquid Tide fresh scent. So with our new washing machine our Repair man and the Manual suggested Tide Pods only. So we assumed we could just switch to Fresh Scent Tide Pods made for our machine. The very first load the scent was so overwhelming the fresh scent, I sneezed every time I walked into our laundry room. So I was fairly certain the smell on my husbands hankies would not pass his smell test. I was right, it triggered our allergies. So I thought I would give Tide Pods free and gentle a chance. To my surprise it was very effective, cleaned normal stains and gave the laundry a nice clean smell withoutTriggering our allergies!",

                "reviewText": "Tide PODS Free & Gentle have become my go-to laundry detergent for a variety of reasons. These liquid pacs offer an exceptional combination of cleaning power, convenience, and a gentle touch that my family and I truly appreciate.First and foremost, the \"Free & Gentle\" formulation is a game-changer for those with sensitive skin or allergies. It's incredibly gentle on clothing, yet it doesn't compromise on cleaning effectiveness. I've noticed that our clothes feel soft and retain their color, all while being completely free from the irritation often associated with harsh detergents.The convenience of these pacs cannot be overstated. No more measuring or spilling liquid detergent \u2013 just toss a pod into the drum and you're good to go. It simplifies the laundry process and reduces the risk of overusing detergent. It's especially handy for college students or busy professionals.Despite the gentle nature of these pods, they are tough on stains. I've been pleasantly surprised by their stain-removing abilities, whether it's a coffee spill or grass stains on my children's clothes. They effectively tackle a wide range of stains, which is a big plus for families with active lifestyles.The fresh and clean scent these pods impart to our laundry is also appreciated. It's not overpowering but leaves clothes smelling pleasantly clean and vibrant.One potential drawback is the price, as Tide PODS can be more expensive than traditional liquid detergents. However, I've found that the convenience and stain-fighting abilities are well worth the investment.In summary, Tide PODS Free & Gentle Laundry Detergent Liquid Pacs are a fantastic addition to any laundry routine. They offer the perfect blend of gentleness, convenience, and stain-fighting power. If you have sensitive skin or simply want a laundry detergent that simplifies your life and keeps your clothes looking and feeling great, these pacs are an excellent choice. They've made a noticeable difference in our laundry routine, and I wouldn't consider switching to anything else.",
