I can't say it's cleaning any better than the other detergents I usually use Tide, Sam's Club Members Mark, or Costco's Kirkland brands. I like Clorox products for their reliability, but I am disappointed to learn that it is imported. It's unnecessary to transport laundry detergent across an ocean when we have manufacturers here.",
