For example, recently one of the kids friends was hugging them and as she dug her nose in she said \"ohhh the lovely smell of your family\". So apparently we have a consistently nice smell that is distinct to everyone in our family!And..... Hate the new zipper top! Spend several minutes trying to open the damn thing every time a new bag is needed. Please change it. I understand wanting /needing to make it child proof, but I'm an able bodied adult who cannot get that zipper to work, so what someone with dexterity, sight or other issues? How would they open /reopen the bag?",
