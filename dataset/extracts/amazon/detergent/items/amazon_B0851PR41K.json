                "reviewText": "I give this product 4 stars because it really does add so much scent to your laundry. I used my regular persil as a detergent, and added a very small capful of this to it. And by cupful, I mean a few drops. Doing it this way, I can see how the bottle would last for an extremely long time, maybe even a year. It's the scent that I don't like. It is very heavy, and it reminds me of my grandmother's house. The brand however, I believe is very good. I washed a blanket with this a couple days ago, and it is still as strongly scented as it was coming out of the dryer. I am ordering this same product, just in a different scent.",
