The price is amazing for the amount you get, its even cheaper here than at my nearest Walmart. The All In One cleans horribly stained clothes beautifully. No fabric softener is needed after; I have had no issues with static cling even when washing the little ones sheets, blankets, and towels. However I like the long lasting fragrance that fabric softener provides and do use a liquid fabric softener on my clothing/bedding when I wash it. Side note: My first order of this came very damaged and leaked out all over, the lid was completely off it, but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement which arrived in great shape.",

I wash my dogs bedding with it and they haven't had any type of skin reaction either so that's a plus. Compared to other detergents in the same price range this is definitely the best I've run across. I saw some reviews complain about leakage, but all of my shipments have been well packaged with no leaking.",
