I waited to write my review until I washed a load of towels since many of the reviews indicate that it made their towels uncomfortable. I add vinegar to my wash as a fabric softener and my towels came out just fine! The lavender scent smells wonderful but not overpowering. I felt like my clothes smell nice and were clean and soft. Plus no more itching! I like it!",

Had to send the last one back as it also damaged other items in my delivery. Sadly now I have to reorder out of subscription and it will cost me more!I love this product and appreciate that it is hypoallergenic. Has a minimal smell which I appreciate as well. Works well and makes clothes feel soft and clean.",
