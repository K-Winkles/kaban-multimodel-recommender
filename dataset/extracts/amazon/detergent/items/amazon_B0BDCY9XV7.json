                "reviewText": "I've been searching for an eco-friendly replacement for my usual big plastic containers for a while now. I started with scented laundry sheets by another brand and didn't like the concept very much. The sheets sometimes didn't dissolve fully or just left tiny particles on the clothes which drove me NUTS :)I then decided to experiment with laundry tablets and came across this product. So far, I like the tablets. it's easy to use, and contrary to what I've read, the tablets arrived in almost-perfect condition. Of the entire container, there was only one tablet that was broken. The manufacturer actually added a note saying that because they know some tablets might break during packaging or shipment, they add 2 additional tablets per container for free. I didn't actually count to confirm this was true but I thought it was a nice gesture and action. So, at the end of the day, if they did in fact include 2 extra tablets, I got full quantity for what I had paid for. The tablets are very easy to use, dissolve completely, and so far from what I could tell, clean well. I do not however have small kids and haven't yet tested the tablets with really hard stains. With everyday dirt and stains (including hiking), they worked just fine. The one thing I regret is that the tablets only come in unscented option. I realize that this is a matter of preference and some people might actually prefer that. For me, it would have been nice to have a gentle/natural scent to it. It's definitely not the end of the world and I've been experimenting with adding a few drops of aromatic oils for fragrance. I appreciate the eco-friendly packaging and though I haven't yet ordered a refill, I'm pretty sure I will and hope that the tablets continue to perform and arrive whole in their packaging. It's a bit pricy when compared to standard laundry detergents (cost per load) but I'm guessing that you pay for what you get. Perhaps if/when eco-friendly detergents will become more mainstream, cost will go down. As a whole, I recommend this product and will continue to experiment with fragrance and different levels of stains.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars They don't dissolve fast enough in a low water HE washer",
                "reviewText": "Additional comments: I have decided to not purchase these again. They just don't dissolve fast enough and I wonder how clean my clothes really are. I have a HE Bosch washer and it uses so little water that you can interrupt the wash cycle and open the door. These tablets need to be in a pool of water because they fizz to dissolve (I tested it). That just never happens in my washer. Luckily the wash cycles are very long and eventually the tablet is gone, but I wonder at wish point my laundry is actually washing in all the soap that could be there. Could it only be the last 10 min.? If you have a HE machine like I do, don't get this product. There are sheets and pods that work better for this type of washer.Previous review:I understand scent doesn't equal clean, but it's still nice to have fresh laundry that has a nice smell. This is not the first product of this type that I have used. I have tried sheets and pods but the washing power didn't seem that great. So far these work well but if you have a front loader be sure to put the tablet way in the back of the drum. Even then I have had to stop a couple of cycles because the tablet got stock in the door and didn't look like it was going to dissolve. It's also a bit concerning to hear it bang around in the drum when the wash cycle first starts. I would hope it would dissolve faster, but so far, in the end it always has, and like I said, the clothes seem to be clean. I think these are a bit pricy compared to other products, so it would be nice if they came as a scented version.",

                "reviewText": "Was really looking forward to this product and eliminating the plastic bottles from the environment. I had read the reviews before, and knew that some tablets would arrive broken, and that really didn't have anything to do with this review; I just used the broken pieces equivalent to one tablet. However using regular non-broken tablets, this just didn't pass the clean test. I followed directions, not pack loading, etc. Perhaps if I used 2 tablets per wash, but then the cost would be much too high consistently. I will try it now to finish off this container. I'll be looking for another environmental friendly washing machine soap/detergent. Maybe they will upgrade this one.I also bought the dishwasher tablets, just tried it for the first time. Unfortunately, when the trigger to open the housing for the tablet occurred, the tablet came out and landed on a ledge of the internal dishwasher and was intact when I opened. Meaning the entire load was not clean and had to be done again. Since this was a first time use, I'll try again...and put this review on the dishwasher soap order page.",

I would recommend and will buy this product again.",
