It is formulated with HE Turbo Clean technology for 6x the cleaning power in half the time (1) and is recommended by leading high efficiency washing machine manufacturers (2).

Try Tide PODS + Febreze Sport Odor Defense with 4-in-1 chamber technology that cleans, removes stains, protects colors and fights odors. (1) Stain removal of 1 dose of Tide HE in Quick cycle vs. 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE-compatible detergent in Normal cycle. (2) Based on co-marketing agreements.",
