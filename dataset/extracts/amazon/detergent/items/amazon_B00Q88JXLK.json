Now, I also have a son who runs cross country, plays lacrosse, and plays soccer\u2026 just imagine the sweat we have in our clothes now! I am so glad Amazon sell this, and for less than what I paid at the running store. Trying to describe the scent, it\u2019s not perfumy in any way, it literally just smells like what the definition of clean would be.",

                "reviewText": "My son has been an ice hockey goaltender for 12 years, and the older he got, the greater the challenge has been to find something to get that awful stink out of his equipment, uniforms and base layers. He is on the ice or in the gym 5-6 days a week, 11 months out of the year and plays with 2-3 teams. While searching for a new product to try, Sweat X Sport Extreme Laundry Detergent popped up in my Amazon ads a few years back, and I gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. My son comes home from practices, the gym and games absolutely soaked and stinking to high heaven. Everything goes straight into the washing machine, and a quick wash with a capful of this stuff, and that body odor smell is gone in one wash. These are items that he wears and uses often and are washed just as often. The scent of this product isn't off-putting or anything like that and my son doesn't complain about it, but the items don't come out of the wash with that pleasant \"clean laundry\" smell. To somewhat achieve that, I have started throwing half a capful of Downy Unstoppables, the one in the dark blue bottle labeled Active Fresh for sports, into the washing machine, too, and it helps to make his undergarments and uniforms smell fresher right out of the wash.",

                "reviewText": "I feel like I have been on the hunt for sports wash for the past 10 years! I have tried so many washes, home remedies, etc. My regular sports wash was sold out so I tried this one - and so glad I did!!! It has now become my go to sport wash. I do think its pricey, but we have a lot of sport wear which are also pricey, and I HATE it when they are stinky!!! I also don't like a lot of washes that have a strong fragrance or chemical smell - those are all out of the running. This detergent has no smell, leaves no smell, and gets the stink OUT!!! My husband is a daily runner and when he gets back his clothes are soaked like he came out of a swimming pool. I don't wash these clothes daily - I wait until there are a few days of clothes to wash - so they marinate in stink a few days. This makes it even harder to get the smelliness out - but this detergent works great. Its amazing!! I highly recommend it.",
