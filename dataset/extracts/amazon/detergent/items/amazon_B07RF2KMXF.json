I\u2019ve never dealt with laundry that had tough stains or impossible odors so I can\u2019t speak to how one free and clear detergent stacks against the other in that regard. But this stuff always seem to leave clothes residue-free and genuinely refreshed without surfactants or perfume. The packets make it really handy for people who have to go to shared or laundry rooms. You can just grab as many pods as loads you plan on washing rather than lugging around heavy bottles.",

Toss one in the washer, no mess, no fuss, no powder crud everywhere. They dissolve quick and easy with no gross residue left behind. A warning - they do turn sort of a brownish orange as they age. So if you buy a huge bucket of them they start off clear, and by the time you finish using them, the last ones are an ugly light brown color. They work just fine and don't stain the clothes, I think it's just the dissolving envelope around the thing starting to break down.",
