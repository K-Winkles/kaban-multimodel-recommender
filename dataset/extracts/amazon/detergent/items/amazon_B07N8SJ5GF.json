But if you're the type who thinks with your head as well as your nose, you'll love this: Gain laundry detergent works in both HE and regular machines, and the detergent lifts away dirt and locks in amazing scent to keep your laundry smelling great even after two weeks! We could go on about the Perfume Micro Capsules that gradually break and release scent while you wear your clothes so you're always getting bursts of ahhhhh, but you've probably already left to wash your laundry with Gain laundry detergent. Gain Liquid Laundry Detergent in Original Scent combines overtones of orange, lemon and blossoms with a modern fruity, green twist and undertones of white floral jasmine with a hint of woody amber.\"",

But I wasn\u2019t, and so, a lot of detergent came out too fast, and ended up everywhere. It was a mess. I love the idea of less packaging, but wonder if the inner bag will drain completely or will I need to cut it open and wash it to recycle with a store\u2019s shopping bags. The lid can be recycled, but from what I\u2019ve heard, it won\u2019t be, that all plastic bottles end up in landfills. I love the scent and the job of cleaning that it does. Gain and its bigger name sibling are always my go-to detergent because of their cleansing power. This was a good package deal that should last the three of us a good while.",
