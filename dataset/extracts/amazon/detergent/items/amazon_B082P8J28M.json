                "reviewText": "The only reason I'm giving these four stars is that the lavender vanilla scent of the sheets is lovely but there is none of it remaining when clothes come out of the dryer. This may be a plus for some people! I went from a very popular name brand liquid detergent starting with T to powdered detergents in cardboard boxes to reduce my plastic usage, but didn't like the powder residue sometimes still on my clothes. (I have a front load washer by the way.) Saw these and thought they would be perfect for my daughter going to college as they take up very little space, so I started using them as well and I feel they do a great job getting our clothes clean. She works out a lot and has no complaint about her sweaty workout clothes.",

                "reviewText": "When I discovered these last fall at C o s t c o I was thrilled to not have to deal with big, heavy plastic jugs that took up a lot of space in my laundry room. (Then when I saw them on here in the Unscented I went ahead and ordered a supply while they were in stock so I'd have them). I didn't mind that I had to spend an extra minute to make sure they dissolved completely. I did notice they didn't seem to clean as well as my liquid detergent but I was so happy at the prospect of how much space I was saving that I brushed it off and just added an extra half or sometimes whole sheet depending on how dirty the clothes or how large the load was, like towels....which I noticed never seemed as fresh and clean anymore. But I so wanted to love these that I just kept trying them and making adjustments until one day I noticed that my laundry room smelled a little like soured laundry. By the third day the smell was getting worse, and by the end of that day the smell would knock you over when opening the laundry room door, and was even beginning to make the bathroom and hallway smell. I could tell it was coming from the washer. It took me hours to finally make the connection to the laundry sheets and I wasn't even positive that was the problem (as the dishwasher plastic detergent pods had been with our dishwasher and drain line years before) until I ran the washer full of just hot water & half gallon of bleach once, which only helped a little. Then I ran it full of hot water & 1 gallon of vinegar which I let sit for an hour before running it through the wash/rinse cycle. That almost got rid of the smell completely, so I did that again but added a cap full of Tide liquid, and that finally rid the smell completely, and I'm guessing the gunk buildup as well, because I've had no problems since. And I haven't used these detergent sheets any more either. I definitely do not recommend them.Not that it matters now, but I was not sent the Unscented ones I ordered, but was sent Lavender Vanilla.",
