                "reviewText": "I only use a capful of this or two depending on the size of the load in addition to unscented soap. It's highly effective in that amount. It is extremely condensed and highly scented, so in that way it's not that expensive. Don't use more (unless you want to) and don't follow the directions on the bottle. The scent is fantastic and makes me feel good and inspires me. I can't explain why but the scent makes me want to keep my house clean. Sheets and towels are dreamy and I feel like a fancy gal. Like a Diva, I guess. (Closest I'm gonna get) However...The container it comes in totally sucks. I'm looking for another bottle to transfer the Diva into. No matter how you pour it, it leaks onto the main bottle and it's nearly impossible to not get it on your finger or whatever. Even if you pour it with ninja precision it leaks when you screw it back on. The scent is VERY STRONG and does not totally wash off your skin even with soap. I like that it's super condensed because a little goes a long way but come on, Tyler Company. Use some of those $25 bucks-a-little-bottles and design a container that dispenses well. I'm thinking i'm going to use a flip-top shampoo type bottle from the dollar store, if I can find one. Long story short=I love this stuff and I'm totally into it. It's worth it. Until they change the bottle/jug though, you should make a better plan for dispensing it.*Edit* I tried several different types of bottles and this is the best one. It's a 32 oz pump dispenser bottle from Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "So, I am obssessed with scents...I always like smelling good just cause it's soothing. I found out about this from a YouTube compilation video, \"Amazon Must Haves Tik Tok Made Me Buy\", there's tons and they are so helpful, for real. But anywho - it was instructed by the individual to only use a tiny amount mixed into your regular detergent. That makes a BIG difference. Especially because the bottle says to pour 1/3 cup to your load.After reading a lot of reviews - I almost didn't buy because:1. S C E N T - some people really didn't enjoy it. \"Grandma\" and \"Musty\" were used a lot - and I was not going for it either LOL.2. TOO STRONG - some people complained of the scent just being too overpowering and not going away! I can't have that, if it doesn't smell amazing!But I went back and watched that YouTube video - followed the instructions and it smells so good. I laid in bed with the dried clothes and fell asleep.I think the scent may just come down to nose receptors. Everyone smells things differently.I purchased DIVA - A warm and complex fragrance overflowing with delicious fruits and rich florals. Rich aromatic chocolate and amber complete this luscious long lasting soothing blend.If you normally don't like fragrances that have any of these notes - you will not like DIVA. Lol, I assure you. But there are many different types from Tyler: Eucalyptus, French Market, High Maintenance, Kathina, Icon, Tyler, Fleur De Lis... etc (yes, there's more)The only reason I gave it 4 stars - although it's a deal to buy through Amazon rather than directly from Tyler, 32 oz for $25 is a bit pricey, but the smell makes it worth it. If I could wash it with everything (it says linen, lingerie and fine fabrics) then it may be a different story. Also, I wish it came with a spout or a cup.Otherwise, I really love it and will continue to buy. Maybe I'll try other scents!",
