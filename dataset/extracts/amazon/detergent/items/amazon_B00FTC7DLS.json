I have found this cleans really well (both the unscented and scented) and lasts a good while and with a baby we are always doing laundry. I don't find that my clothes have any smell, even biking or without gear, I haven't noticed more stains sticking around and I feel good about using this. You'll know when you wash a mask in the winter and they don't smell! The lavender grapefruit is nice, it's not overpowering and it smells like real lavender with a hint of grapefruit which therefore makes it but so floral. The only negative is that it's a little expensive but Amazon is where I've found the best price as of now. I'm happy with this and my search has halted. I would recommend trying a bottle and if you love it then subscribe for a shipment and save a little more!",

I was previously using the Method brand detergent and wanted something without the artificial brightened. I love this detergent! It smells great (the smell does dissipate after drying, because the scent is all-natural), but more importantly I feel like my clothes are actually softer compared to my previously detergent! Especially my sheets. Everything feels so clean and soft, I have found my new detergent! Some reviews mention it being hard to pour, I wonder if they keep their house relatively cold? I keep mine at 70 degrees and I think with the formula having coconut oil that does make a difference! I don\u2019t find it any different to pour than other detergents. In fact, the spout/lid are designed very well, there\u2019s been no goopy build-up like I had with Method.",

I only gave it 4 stars because once it goes through a wash there was not a lavender smell, that being said, it still gave the clothing an amazingly clean fresh smell. It seems to clean well and the clothes felt so soft afterwards!",

                "reviewText": "When I was pregnant I bought a dreft detergent to wash all my baby's clothes but right after dreft changed the nice scent detergent and I didn't like the new version. Since I bought better life cleaning products for my cleaning business I decided trying this detergent just for my baby clothes and I loved it. The only thing is if you order straight from their website takes longer to arrive but it is a bit cheaper.I had the pump from my previous detergent, because this one from Amazon didn't include one.",

This detergent was wonderful- it keeps our skin from being dry and scaley. Best of all, you only use a small capful and it cleans the clothes! It takes a while to use it up so this is a perfect way to save money. Try one - you will buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is an OK detergent, but it fails to clean the dirtiest of clothes. My search of a natural / safer laundry detergent has not finished. If you want more natural biodegradable detergents (and you feel better to not be tested on animals), I suggest trying this to see if works for you.For me it works best for colored clothes, lightly soiled (just normal wear). This detergent keeps colors vibrant, darks dark and works well on delicate clothing. But I don't find it helps dissolving dirt and stains, especially the most difficult one; my kitchen towels and cleaning rags are left stained, although they look bright.I have used this detergent with same results in both cold and hot water.I tried using more for dirtier clothes, didn't help. Using the recommended quantity will still help to do more loads and not waste detergent.I use it on my standard top loader; at first (when the water pours) it does a lot of suds, but during the wash cycle there is barely any foam.The lavender grapefruit scent is OK, but it doesn't linger after drying; I do prefer my clothes not to smell of laundry detergent, so for me this is not an issue. I'm not keen on lavender, but the grapefruit scent helps the scent being more pleasant (but it doesn't matter since it doesn't linger).I have sensitive skin, this didn't caused any irritation.After I stop using this laundry detergent I also started noticing more static on my clothes; so I supposed it helped a lot with keeping static off my clothes.",

                "reviewText": "The reason I bought this laundry detergent was because it was one of the very few detergents that was not only rated A on EWG's cleaning database (database that rates products based on how healthy the ingredients are for humans and environments), but it was one of the best rated A products because literally all the ingredients were rated A and B (unlike some of the A rated products that still had very minimal amounts of C and D rated ingredients). Does a great job cleaning our clothes. No bad smells. Great consistency, a little goes a long way. Good value for being one of the safest ingredient detergents on the market, the few other ones that were rated just as good, were more expensive.",

The scent of this detergent is very mild so if like me you prefer your clothes not to be heavily scented, you will love this. If you prefer more scent I recommend adding a few drops of a quality essential oil to your dryer balls. My families favorite combo for dryer balls is lavender and citrus fresh or lemon.",
