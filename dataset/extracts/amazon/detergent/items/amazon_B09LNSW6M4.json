My baby has not had any bad reaction and the soap doesn't leave any residue on clothes. You also don't need to use more than they say on the package, one sheet is fine for a regular load on clothes, though I do use one and a half for towels.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought these sheets specifically for international travel, because I don't trust detergents I can buy abroad. These travel so well. Except when traveling in hot weather, the sheets tend to really stick together. The scent before use is really quite strong. I was turned off by this. I found this to be unexpected for a natural product. However, after washing, the sheets leave the clothes smelling just right. The clean is also quite effective. Overall I can't complain with this product. Effective, easy to use and travel with and gives the nice subtle aroma after washing, not too offensive to me or others around me. I highly recommend even if not traveling.",

I purchased these sheets because it\u2019s hard to find the detergent that I don\u2019t get rashes from in a small size at the grocery store and prefer to buy in bulk. They don\u2019t take a lot of space, I use a quarter of a sheet, my clothes are getting clean, and I don\u2019t get a rash. So far, so good!",

No scent I could notice.Items that were dirty smelling came out not stinky, not fresh smelling though. Neutral. For very soiled items or a very full laundry machine I needed to use 4 segments, and sometimes ended up adding powder tide it needed some help. 2 segments for regular not dirty stuff or a half full laundry machine.For those concerned with waste and chemicals I'd purchase. Good price and results typical with other friendly soaps. Lasted about 3 weeks. Satisfied with the longevity",
