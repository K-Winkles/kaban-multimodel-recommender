                "reviewText": "If you have sensitive skin this is the laundry detergent to get. I've been using it for years and have never had an issue. It also works well in my LG washer. I use very little to clean sheets and very little to clean dark clothes. The only time I use a full measure is when I'm washing towels. This does not get too sudsy so good for HE washers. A little goes a long way so while other detergents may be less expensive I think you really get more for your money with using this as you don't need to use as much! This is one of the brands I trust and I think you will too!~The Rebecca Review",
