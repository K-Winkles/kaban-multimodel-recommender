Even with using a small amount, it tackles stains and leaves fabrics looking and feeling great. It's gentle on clothes but tough on dirt, which is exactly what I need, especially for my family's laundry.The 128 loads per pack is fantastic value for money. It's practical, cost-effective, and delivers exceptional results. Moreover, the bottles are easy to handle and pour from, making laundry days a breeze.If you're looking for a laundry detergent that's both effective and long-lasting, Mrs. Meyer's Honeysuckle formula is a definite winner.

                "reviewText": "We started using this product after seeing it at my husband's mother's house. She is easily bothered by even trace odors and is very persnickety when it comes to her laundry.We fell in love with it instantly. A very small amount suds up perfectly getting the laundry beautifully clean. It leaves behind a lovely scent that even the pickiest of my sons really like. It is naturally pleasant but not overwhelming or chemical like in any way.We like it so very much regardless of the season and thus have subscribed to this product. Now it comes regularly without any further action or follow up on part.Getting the laundry clean in my home has been simplified and I could not be happier! No regrets.",

Since using this brand I have not been at all disappointed and have had a great reduction in skin rashes from other products. Every time someone comes into my home I get a lot of compliments on how clean it smells and the scent is not at all overpowering.",
