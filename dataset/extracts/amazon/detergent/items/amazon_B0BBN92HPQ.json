                "reviewText": "I LOVE the smell of the pod version of this, and I use them often, but I needed to buy a liquid detergent because I don't always have loads big enough to justify wasting a pod on. This is perfect to throw in a tiny amount of detergent and get those small loads of clothes smelling clean and looking fresh! :) For sure an excellent purchase and something I always need on hand. Worth the value, and LOVE the cleaning power and scent.",
