I\u2019m washing clothes daily from an incontinent loved one, and this detergent can handle the entire kit and kaboodle. I previously used 2-4 different cleaning agents to reach a modicum of acceptable cleanliness, but the recommended amount of Biokleen has replaced all of those! (I have an HE machine, and the recommended amount is a slight 1/2 cap - maybe 2 Tablespoons??? ) Clothes are clean and fresh with no lingering odors.The price/load is extremely reasonable!I seriously could make a commercial for Biokleen Laundry Detergent. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc",

                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings about this detergent. It's skin and environment friendly, it has a mild pleasant scent, it's cost-effective, and it's readily available in stores in a pinch. However, in terms of it's actual cleaning ability, which is arguably one, if not the most, important consideration, it's hit or miss. On your everyday dirty laundry (aka daily clothing, shower and hand towels, bedding), it does it's job. Everything comes out clean, smelling fresh, and lacks that white residue that can sometimes happen with \"green\" detergents. Now, on your especially dirty, funky, or stained laundry (e.g. gym clothes, food/blood/grease/oil stains, \"my toddler likes to take a bath in the dirt\" clothing, fabric dye stains, and anything involving mildew), it fails miserably. Despite trying various methods and settings with this detergent, the stains and smells are still there! I try to pre-treat the stains best I can, but that's hard to do in our busy household with a toddler. I have ended up having to use a different, more-pricey product to deal with this part of the laundry, which as you can imagine, is both frustrating and time consuming. At the end of the day, I'm torn. On one hand, it meets all my requirements for a detergent; on the other hand, it only meets 2/3rds of my \"cleaning\" needs. Before I give up on this brand, I\u2019ve decided to try the Sports version as I\u2019m hoping that will pack the extra punch and leave all my laundry smelling and looking great.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this detergent for my family since 2020. If you use a HE washer you only need a half capful, and the cap is very small so the large bottle lasts quite a long time. The ingredients work very well for my daughter and I who have sensitive skin. I have also recommended it to our church because they just bought a washer/dryer to clean items for babies in the nursery. A good way to remove the toxic chemicals included in other detergents from your house!",

Modern washers don't put nearly enough water into your load, and actually sometimes don't even wet all the clothes! Get a old washer, with no electronics and no frills, those are work horses, and they actually wash your clothes. New washers (last 10-15 years) are JUNK! Get a washer made in the 90s - early 2000s if you actually want your clothes clean",
