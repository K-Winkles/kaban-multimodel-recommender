                "reviewText": "These jugs are heavy. However, I don't mind since they have the pump feature for when I put in liquid laundry detergents and such because I won't have to hold this 64oz jug. They come with the chalkboard-like stickers but I don't think I will use them because I want to do some scripty stuff in a larger font.Very please with these glass jugs but I would not recommend if you have dexterity issues as you will encounter difficulty re-filling the jugs.",
