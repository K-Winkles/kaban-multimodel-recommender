I love that it\u2019s such a bang for your buck, it takes up significantly less space, there\u2019s no risk of accidentally spilling it and no need to measure out how much detergent you need for your load. I usually throw in one for a normal load and two for my work clothes, which get dirtier on average. My clothes come out clean and fresh every wash and I never feel like I\u2019m missing my old detergent. Goodbye liquid detergent! I am a detergent sheet customer for life now!",

                "reviewText": "DATE OF ORDER: 09/09/23DATE RECEIVED: 09/13/23DATE OF REVIEW: 01/19/24PERSONAL BUY or PRODUCT TO REVIEW: This is a Personal BuyDELIVERY: Products delivered by UPS. 6 Days from time of order to delivery.QUALITY: Laundry sheets work as intended. In the box, they are lightly fragrant. However, after the wash, the clothes are clean but left with little to no fragrance. The pads appear to be 'rubbery' in texture. They are small in size. About 4.5\" x 2.5\" and thin. They dissolve quickly in the wash (even in cold water). You may want to make sure that your hands are dry. They might dissolve on your hands otherwise.INTENDED PURPOSE: In use for Washing clothes for about 3 months now.RECOMMENDATION: The catch to remember...The sheets are proportioned for the load size. 1 sheet will do a small load (not medium as indicated on the box). 2 sheets will do a medium load. It takes 3 sheets to do a large load. 4 Sheets for an extra large load. So, if you are washing for a family, even though the box says 200 sheets, that will only net you 66 large loads. 50 extra large loads. If you use 'bottled' type laundry soap, its much heavier (by comparison); takes up a lot of space, you have to dispose/recycle the bottle; you can spill liquids; you can't really control proportions based on a 'cap full'. The cardboard box that they come in slides open with the push of a finger. It would be very convenient to carry something light weight like this to the laundry mat if you are required to do that. It is cardboard so from that perspective, its biodegradable if that interests you and won't fill up landfills as easy. There is no indication where this particular product is made (in the ad nor on the box). We've searched the internet extensively with no results. There is a company in Austin, TX named Zinwin but it is a consulting company. NOT a laundry soap company. Knowing Amazon, its a MADE IN CHINA product. It appears to be a deliberate cover up. As for the particular product, we would buy this 'type' of product again instead of liquids. We'll just look elsewhere for another similar product unless the manufacturer identifies where this particular product is made.",

                "reviewText": "Doing laundry isn't fun. Laundry detergent is expensive. So expensive stores put those theft devices on them just like they do computers and TVs. It's laundry detergent not diamonds. Then there's the waste. Giant plastic containers, leaky spigots, powders that spill, measuring etc and so on. But that's just the detergent. Pods are awesome if you have spare kidneys to sell to get a couple months supply and I haven't even gripes about the flowery perfumy scents. I dread the chore of laundry. I was so surprised by this miraculous invention. These have a very pleasant scent. The Amazon box heheh arrived in and everything in it smelled terrific. The box weighs almost nothing and ya just put the amount of sheets you want in your load and done. No garbage dumpster worth of trash, like why hasn't laundry detergent been like this before? I washed 2 ways with these. I filled the laundry tub with water dropped in the sheets and let the machine mix it, then put clothes in. The other way I dumped my clothes in, put the sheets on top and closed the lid and walked away. Both came out the same. Clean light scent clothes. Eureka!! I'll never buy cable locked security controlled landfill filling laundry detergent again.",
