                "reviewText": "I have searched for a good clean laundry detergent for about a year that doesn\u2019t have harsh chemicals or doesn\u2019t irritate the skin and this one is the best so far! It smells great and cleans my clothes very well. I have tried making my own and it just leaves a weird film on my clothes. This does great with my son\u2019s sensitive skin and doesn\u2019t make him itchy or get a rash. I get the largest size and will last me awhile. It is definitely more on the expensive side, but it\u2019s worth it to have a clean and safe detergent. Stop looking and buy this one.",

It smells good but not overwhelming. It does a great job cleaning clothes and my son who was constantly itching his skin is no longer itching after his clothes have been washed with this. Also, my clothes feel a little softer.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Poorly labeled",
                "reviewText": "I used half the bottle already doing a week worth of laundry but then realized I was using too much! The instructions say to use just under half the 40ml mark for a regular load and the full 40ml for a larger load. I just assumed the full cap was 40ml, which is what MOST laundry detergent packaging would be. But that\u2019s not the case with this cap - there\u2019s a barely visible line a little more than halfway up the cap marking the 40ml. Paying more than $20 for a small bottle like this, the packaging should be more clear or at least label the 40ml in some way that\u2019s more clearly seen. I wasted a lot of product because of a poor packaging decision. I would suggest either a cap that is actually 40ml so there\u2019s no confusion or at least a darker line that\u2019s visible without searching for it. Do you even see the line in my picture of the cap? I promise it\u2019s there - tou just can\u2019t see it without searching. Doing my laundry shouldn\u2019t be so complicated and not at this price. Maybe I\u2019ll do what an other reviewer did and draw my own line. I would expect to do that off a dollar store brand but not something this expensive. You can afford better caps at this price. Other than that, the peppermint scent isn\u2019t my favorite. It\u2019s minty but not like the peppermint you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s like stale rather than bright and minty. I\u2019m going to try the either lavender or citrus next time. This isn\u2019t the mint type of scent I like. My clothes did smell clean when they came out though and the product does clean them without leaving any residue.",
