                "reviewText": "I love this detergent. I have tried so many different \"clean\" brands that claim your clothes are still getting clean, even with only a little bit of powder or liquid, but they continue to smell after washing. I have purchased this detergent 3-4 times now. They are scented, but it's not overpowering and I have not had any issues with sensitive skin. My clothes actually feel clean and smell clean when they're done! I don't love the dispenser on the box. It can be kind of hard to press down, but that's my only complaint. I will continue to buy this detergent because I appreciate that there are no toxic ingredients and I feel like my clothes are actually getting clean.",

I just came on to reorder & I see that the price spiked up to $23 before tax. I can\u2019t purchase this at that price point. It\u2019s disappointing & frustrating but, for the amount of loads & size..$24-25 for one bottle isn\u2019t for me. Oh well \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
