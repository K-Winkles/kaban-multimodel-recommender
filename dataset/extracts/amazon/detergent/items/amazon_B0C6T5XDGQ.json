First off, I thought I was getting the amount listed in rectangular sheets the size of what you imagine a box of dryer sheets is. These are half size sheets. Which is fine, just not what was expected. They clean my laundry well but I just don\u2019t love the scent. Smells like some cheap cleaner I\u2019d buy to mop floors with on my clothes and towels. Won\u2019t be buying these again just because of the smell",

                "reviewText": "I had to move to a senior facility, but I\u2019ve used detergent sheets for many years, and I love them. I\u2019ve passed them out to all my friends here, and they really love them too. They are so convenient to use. They\u2019re so much easier to store, they are certainly lighter than detergent bottles and you don\u2019t really need as much soap as you find in pods.I actually ordered these for my 99 year old friend who loves them, but doesn\u2019t really use any kind of smart media and couldn\u2019t order them for herself. My other friends all are capable of getting them themselves and I will order them for myself again when I run low.This brand seems like the best value.I gave a box to my grandson to use in college so he wouldn\u2019t have to carry a heavy detergent bottle to the laundry room in his dorm. I\u2019ll give him some more when he returns in the fall since he\u2019s actually using them!They are also the easiest thing to take when you travel just put some in a Ziploc bag. You can cut them or tear them and just have enough soap for a sink full of clothes or a bathtub if you wantI really recommend detergent sheets for everyone they are good for the environment because they don\u2019t come in a big plastic bottle or a plastic container and they get totally used up in the wash. I don\u2019t notice a scent and while I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly sensitive I do think I\u2019d notice if I felt itchy,etc but I don\u2019t.Don\u2019t hesitate to buy these.",
