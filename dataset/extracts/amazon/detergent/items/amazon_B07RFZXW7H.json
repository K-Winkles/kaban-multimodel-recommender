It is also great for my sensitive skin. I don't like the general products because they tend to cause my skin to irritate and break out. It is much less with this product. The only issue I've ever faced is that sometimes there is a gel-like substance left over on some of my clothes, like it doesn't properly dissolve in the washer. It goes away when I rewash it, probably due to not enough water saturation.Pros:-Efficient-Clean and leaves no mess-Smells good-Good for sensitive skinCons:-Can be costly if you do a lot of laundry and big loads-Sometimes gel clumps up on clothes",
