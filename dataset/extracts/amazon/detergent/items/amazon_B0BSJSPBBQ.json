                "reviewText": "FIRST, YOUR LAUNDRY WILL NOT SMELL LIKE VINEGAR! I stopped using downy about a year or so ago & was using vinegar until I found this gem! I have super sensitive skin (mostly to chemicals, SLS, etc) but it was hard to switch to eco friendly laundry products cause I wanted that clean laundry smell! After I switched from downy I noticed that the cloths felt different from not using it! They felt better (no like almost waxy feel? And towels don\u2019t repel water now)!!!!!! This softens enough and has a very light, clean smell! Nothing I have (mostly natural fabrics & activewear) feels scratchy, pills excessively, etc.I have a Samsung front loader that is suuuper finicky with it\u2019s dang codes\u2026 but this actually helps with the soap buildup (I run the self clean once a month & when i glance at it there doesn\u2019t seem to be much buildup! I have to be super careful in using the recommended dose for the he machine but when I adhere to that I\u2019ve never pulled laundry out that smelled like vinegar!Vinegar is great for new clothes tho! If you remember making tie dye stuff you soak it with a little vinegar to set the dye & I think this really helps my colored clothing (i even use it on activewear)! I\u2019ve also diluted in a spray bottle to brush out old fleece & it works like a charm to make those fluffy again. I also use this spray to refresh some things when I go to steam them to wear them (don\u2019t want that older house closet smell).Once you dry your clothes the eucalyptus scent may not come through, so I personally drop a few drops of EO on wool dryer balls & bam! Wonderfully smelling laundry!",

The thing I like the best is that it really removes odors well. It doesn't leave a strong chemical smell after wash. Just a clean neutral smell. My only complaint is the use of the plastic container but I don't know how to get around it yet. Was hopeful with the detergent \"sheets\" but they didn't clean well at all imo. Wish they could sell a concentrate where you just had to add water to it. But otherwise, I'll continue to use this product.",
