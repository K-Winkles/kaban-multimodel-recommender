It has a clamp the you slide down over the spicket from the back. Long story short. I went to test it to see if everything was good. Well, let's just say the spicket came off then I lifted it to pour the detergent and it went all over my new floor. After I got up the mess and washed the containers out I tried gluing the spicket on before to seal them before putting the clamp back on and gluing it also. They still leaked so, I wound up having to return them. I was so disappointed because they really looked nice in my newly painted and redecorated laundry room. I would not recommend this product to anyone.",

To turn the spout on, the flip switch is easy to use and can be done one handed which I find convenient. It\u2019s also nice to not have to pour bottles into cups.

I really made sure that the spigot was in correctly and tight, because I had read reviews that said it could leak. Went to use it and the entire spigot came out and fabric softener went everywhere. So not a good product.",

I didn't realize until a few hours later when I returned to the laundry room that the spigot was leaking and I lost a bunch of product.The leak doesn't come from the connection to the tub as you'd expect if it was improperly assembled. It leaks from the holes in top of the spigot as seen in the photos. It's as if the pressure from the liquid inside the tub is too much for the spigot quality.Do not recommend! Waste of money and I don't seem to have any options to return it or exchange it...",

So, to repeat,very disappointed.Do not buy this particular product.",
