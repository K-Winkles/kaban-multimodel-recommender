But it gave me a little headache. I\u2019m going to try and dilute it more and see if that helps. It\u2019s very thick and concentrated. It reminds me of dreft, which is why tried it from reviews. Clothes came out nicely clean, like I said it was just leaving them wayyy too perfumed. And I\u2019m a gal who loves perfume but sheesh. Again maybe we\u2019re sensitive? It smells like my baby got flower bombed. I want love this product because it\u2019s a great value and looks / feels like it works. Maybe I\u2019ll try the unscented one if that\u2019s an option. I guess 4 stars but I may update.",
