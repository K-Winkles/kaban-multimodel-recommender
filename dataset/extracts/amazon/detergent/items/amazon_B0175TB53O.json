I wash several loads a few days a week and the bag lasts over a month. This is my third time purchasing. I wish it was a few dollars cheaper but after trying a few other clean products I keep coming back to this one.",

I happen to think it leaves the clothes very soft after drying. It is a fine powder but that does not detract from my satisfaction. If you have a respiratory condition, be aware that this has a fine powdery consistency. I switch between this product and liquid detergent so this size \"jar\" seems to last me a long time. If you prefer I think this comes in a liquid form, but I've never tried it.",

The scent is nice and it does a good job cleaning our clothes.

Because of that I went back to my unscented detergent.",

I think I may try the lemon-lime next time. I gave this 4 stars only because of the container. It is hard to fit my hand inside to use the scoop as the level gets lower.

I spent HOURS and HOURS researching and trying to find a good laundry detergent option, and was hoping this was it. Well, I just opened the package, and had to dig around (with a butter knife) to find the included scoop. Started my first load of laundry with this detergent. That was about 10 minutes ago. For that entire time I've been scratching my hand, and just barely realized what I was doing. My fingers and knuckles are covered in hives where they came in contact with the inside of the Woolzies detergent package - even though I washed my hands immediately after digging around for the scoop. I am so discouraged!!! Doesn't ANYONE make a laundry detergent that is truly for people with sensitive skin?!? I just hope I can get a refund, at least!Edit to ad the rest of the story:I already had one load of laundry going when I wrote the above review. Here is the rest of my experience with this detergent. Upon opening the package, the scent was almost overpowering. This didn't bother me much because I have no problem with natural lavender oil. However, through the entire wash cycle, there was a very STRONG, HARSH, unpleasant detergent smell - much stronger than any other detergent I've used. When the wash cycle was complete I could feel a slimy, soapy residue on my clothes. I put them through an additional rinse cycle. I could still feel a soapy residue on them. Ditto after another rinse cycle. I put them through yet another rinse cycle with vinegar added to it, then dried them.Wearing my Woolzies-laundered clothes the next day turned me into a miserable, itchy mess. I ran the clothes through a full wash cycle with just vinegar. My clothes STILL are causing itchy skin reactions. After more than 8 hours in the wash, with less than one scoop of this detergent in hot water. Basically, Woolzies has RUINED all my laundry washed with it. Even Tide residue was not this difficult to remove!",
