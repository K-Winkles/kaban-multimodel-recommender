First, the laundry sheets smell amazing. I literally pick up the package sometimes just to smell the sheets. They smell that good! Second, the laundry sheets are tiny, but pack a big punch against dirty clothes. My clothes came out clean, smelling good, and with no residue left behind. These things are magic! They also wash a lot of loads of laundry, so I find them economical, too. I will be buying them again.",

The little sheet feels like a thin crafting foam but totally dissolves in the detergent dispenser! (there is a perforation to for 1/2 a sheet which makes the 64) It also has a very soft and soothing fragrance. I will definitely order these again!",
