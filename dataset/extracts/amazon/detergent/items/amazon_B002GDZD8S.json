                "reviewText": "Smells very deluxe, I wash my bedding every Friday and I waited until late to do so in order to try this stuff out.Not only did it smell wonderful, my sheets were super buttery soft, like much softer than they are from regular washing with detergent and fabric softener.I've been trying for years to get my laundry to have a nice lingering scent after wash. It seems like once the clothes are fully dry and cool they don't ever retain that \"clean\" smell. I believe that this is the answer.Even after getting out of bed I could detect the nice smell of the detergent had rubbed off onto me! Very nice.High quality product, pricey but worth it as a little treat for yourself( I'm not sharing)",
