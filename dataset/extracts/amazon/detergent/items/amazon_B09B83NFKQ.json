                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A best-in-class laundry detergent for everyone and everything: you MUST try this product!",
                "reviewText": "I'm a long-time Amazon customer and have never bothered to write a product review for anything, but after using the Dirty Labs laundry detergent for the last couple years or so, I just had to write one up because this product is quite simply FANTASTIC.I've suffered from eczema, acne, and extremely sensitive skin my entire life, and have tried EVERYTHING to reduce skin irritation from clothing, sheets, and towels - Tide, Downy, Woolite, you name it. None have worked better than Dirty Labs laundry detergent, which is also conveniently available at Whole Foods. I've washed everything with it: from dress shirts and cashmere sweaters, to workout clothes, underwear, towels. And very quickly, I noticed a huge difference. Eczema flare-ups have quieted down, skin rashes have completely disappeared, itchy skin from undershirts are gone, and best of all, everything in the house just feels...cleaner. I'm not crazy about the \"clean organic ingredients in everything\" movement, but this is ABSOLUTELY one I'm getting on board with.Additionally, my wife used to be a big user of the Mrs. Meyers laundry detergent, but once she tried Dirty Labs, she immediately noticed that her clothes were cleaner and the stains that would usually linger were gone. She quickly got on board with using Dirty Labs as well and has never looked back.They have a few different scents that are bit more subtle, but in my opinion that's the way it should be. What's great is, you actually get just as many laundry loads, if not more, than the giant 1-gallon containers from the other \"mainstream\" brands. The efficiency is incredible and for someone with a slightly smaller laundry room, I 1000% appreciate the functionality (as well as the eco-friendliness) of needing to use less materials.To all the other reviewers not liking the measuring cup: the measuring cup can be a bit tricky to figure out at first, but they actually have directions on their website regarding how to use them properly. And sometimes, it's easier to just eyeball how much you need anyway!HIGHLIGHTS:PROS:+ Highest quality detergent out there on the market. Really cleans whatever you're washing and PERFECT for anyone with sensitive skin or skin conditions.+ This stuff actually cleans. Common lingering stains (i.e. deodorant) and dirt were cleaned without the use of other products like Shout.+ Extremely versatile. I've used it on pretty much everything, including some high-quality wool and cashmere. It's very gentle on delicate clothes while still getting the job done.+ Efficiency. One of these small bottles should last you months, and can get you just as many, if not more, laundry loads out of it than anything you'll see at the store.+ Smaller footprint. Cleaner materials, biodegradable, and just takes up less space in an already-crowded laundry room.CONS:- The scents are more subtle (personally, I don't really see this as a negative).- The measuring cup can be challenging at first, but they have in-depth instructions on how to properly use them on the Dirty Labs website. Since you need so little detergent with each wash, you can easily eyeball how much you need.SUMMARY: this product comes with my HIGHEST recommendation. They have several other products as well but we've been exclusively using the standard laundry detergent and it has significantly improved the quality of our lives. If you find your clothes aren't getting clean or have sensitive skin, you MUST try this product! I look forward to trying their delicates detergent and dishwasher detergent in the near future!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this product for a month now and so far I\u2019m extremely happy with the results. The fragrance is pleasant but subtle and not overpowering. I live on a farm and had been looking for something strong enough to tackle all of the smells and gunk we get into during day to day work and wanted to try something other than a big name brand..they seem to be too fragranced and don\u2019t always do a great job and need a second wash. A little goes a long way with this and I appreciate the concentrated formula as the bottle will do up to 80 loads and takes up very little space in our laundry room. The bottle is also recyclable but will probably be repurposed in the garden. Overall if you\u2019re like us and want to try something new, for this a shot. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I completely switched our laundry detergent to this.It cleans well, it\u2019s free of chemicals, it smells great and not from chemicals and best part is that the container is fully recyclable as it is made out of aluminum.My only contain is the design of the top of the bottle, it mimics a water bottle which is not ideal if you want to prevent drips. The bottle tip and body can get overrun with sticky streaks if you don\u2019t wipe it down after each use.",

                "reviewText": "I love this scent! I smell matcha for sure (earthy green tea) & then a sweet jasmine note, but it pairs perfectly with my fav fabric softener (mrs meyers lavender)!I\u2019ve always been a little let down by eco friendly detergents and I\u2019ve tried sooooo many! I felt like Ecos had this weird soapy smell after the clothes were in my closet? 7th gen was fine but sometimes needed extra things to help it clean a little better? I HAVE ZERO CONS FOR THIS!Granted, I have no children at home & I don\u2019t usually get filthy or smelly\u2026 I do however have a dog that has free reign in my house \ud83e\udd23 and super sensitive skin (im allergic to SLS & many common things) & this doesn\u2019t give me a rash!I have a Samsung front loader washer and dryer and I only use the 8ml mark on the measuring thimble, even for a load of bedding! (I don\u2019t stuff it packed full cause nothing gets clean, but I\u2019d say my fullest load is sheets, a duvet, and a couple of throw blankets) I tried the 2nd mark on the cup but felt like that was too much! (I pour, use the cup to clean up any on the edge, & put the whole thing in the detergent tray slot & it comes out clean after every load)So far this cleans any dog smell, footprints, etc, active wear (i run every day), towels, rugs, floor mop pads, normal soil level for clothes (even gardening clothes) perfectly! I don\u2019t have stains to test or excessive sweat stains, so you\u2019ll have to try it?But even in cold water I feel like this cleans well and rinses clean (and smells amazing!). Once you dry everything it\u2019s still there but it\u2019s not gonna slap you in the face with scent (I hate that).",

                "reviewText": "After years of dealing with what I THOUGHT was a body odor problem, I realized that it was actually my shirts that were the problem, not me. In other words, I'd take off the bad-smelling, BO-ridden shirt only to find that my actual underarms didn't smell that bad... or at all.I bought this detergent in the hopes that it would remove the smelly bacteria that seemed to be built up in the pits of all my shirts. Research led me to believe that my sweat (which is no worse in quantity or smell than the average person), was somehow \"reactivating\" the smelly bacteria living in the shirt.No luck.After a year of washing exclusively with this detergent + their \"booster\"... there has been no change to how my shirt pits smell. They smell fine at first, but after just 2-3 hours of wear (and me sweating normally), the shirt pits start smelling absolutely horrible. It's so bad I have to change to a fresh shirt.So, once I've finished my supply of this stuff, I'll try other products instead. I'm disappointed, as I had high hopes that this would solve my problem by removing whatever crazy BO bacteria is living in all my shirts.",
