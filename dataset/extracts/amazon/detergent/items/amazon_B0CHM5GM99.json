I was frustrated with the amount of plastic I was throwing away, along with the mess of the heavy jugs and laundry detergent spilling.The packaging appears to be recycled cardboard, and it opens like dryer sheets. Each sheet has a perforation, so half a sheet can be used for a very small load. An average load uses 1 sheet and a giant load uses 2. The sheets smell fresh, but I don\u2019t notice scent on my clothing once it\u2019s washed. An added dryer sheet freshens up my towels and sheets. I don\u2019t feel that the detergent sheet softens clothing on its own.The product seems to clean well and would be fabulous for travel. So far, I\u2019m quite pleased.",
