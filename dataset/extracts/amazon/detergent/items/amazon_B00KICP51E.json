I have been using Grab Green dishwashing pods for quite awhile now, and decided to try their laundry detergent. I didn't pay attention, and thought the laundry detergent was pods as well. It is a powder. It comes in the same type bag, so I made assumptions without reading the product description well enough. But it's okay. I just throw a scoop full in my front-load washer, just like a I did the pods I was using. It am pleasantly surprised how well this laundry detergent powder works! Wow - better than my previous 'swear-by' product. My laundry REALLY smells fresh and honestly, just odor-free. No stains left on shirt fronts. Wish I'd switched a long time ago. I use fragrance-free products whenever possible, except for my dish soap - I like grapefruit scent (in a nontoxic brand).",

                "reviewText": "I was browsing looking for a lower suds detergent as I'm doing a good deal more laundry by hand these days...and I found this guy and I am so very very happy I did!!First the fragrance is lovely. I am a bit sensitive to floral scents that are so sweet you're sure your blood glucose will start rise any moment. This Water Lily was, for me, a perfect match to the image the name calls up in my mind and the reality; lightly floral, a hint of a 'green' mossy/fairy pond note, feminine but not at all gender exclusionary LOL! And I must tell you that every single word in the description on line and on the package regarding strength re: stains and brightening/overall cleaning actually---shocked the heck outta me!!!! Frankly, I was surprised at the color of the water as an indicator, perhaps, of dirt left behind by one of the 'big boys' detergents...seriously!Fragrance,- lovely and sustained - CHECK (and even a nice waft over and above my fabric softener.....GUYS MAKE A WATER LILY UTRA CONCENTRATED LIQUID FABRIC SOFTENER PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!)Strength/cleaning ability - Great...GREAT stain removal with no additional spot treatment but with a bit of a soak-CHECK CHECKBrightening - Gotta admit, garments just seemed a bit newer or fresher looking - CHECK CHECK CHECKNow, I gave only one category 4 stars while all others got 5 stars and that was packaging...and in a way even that was being a little tough on them. The detergent is a bit finer granule than the leading detergents and once you open the bag there is a zip way to close it after each use with a scooper inside (thank you btw). However, because of the finer granules, over the course of several consecutive uses where the bag may remain open for a bit, the moisture in the air does make it a teeny bit clumpy. I is NOT a big deal and NOT BAD, hence my hesitancy to really mention it, but it was something I did notice. Simultaneously I thought of other possibilities for packaging and the one I thought of immediately was the square with rounded edges type container of some of the stain fighter additive brands; they have that grooved lid which minimizes the moisture and soft bag SPILLAGE issue just by gently placing the cover over the top opening, not even sealing AND your bags could be the REFILS. (This detergent is a bit pricy though really concentrated, and such a more substantial/harder sided container might add to cost, but NOT much if...IF...the bags were re-done as the refills!! Maybe????)Anyway, great product and it's been a while since I was this pleased outta the box....okay, maybe cabin fever too Ha!",

                "reviewText": "So, I'm a bit of a laundry detergent and toilet paper hoarder. Both are something I don't ever want to run out of and I buy a lot of it when it goes on sale. Seriously, the great tp shortage of 2020 didn't touch my family and I shared with others in need of tp. So, I've had lots of different kinds of laundry detergent. Some I can't use because it's too strong for sensitive skin, some I don't like for the heavy smell, and some just doesn't clean as well - included homemade detergent. I ordered this detergent because I wanted to try laundry stripping but didn't want to use Tide. This is the best detergent I've ever tried. My earlier fav was Norwex but I like this better and i think it's a little bit cheaper. It cleans beautifully. I have an old school top loading machine so nothing fancy. I no longer have young kids at with grass stains, etc but I have a husband who works on our cars and is currently encapsulating the space under our house. His clothes were so caked in red mud that he had to undress in the garage and put the clothes in a garbage bag. Seriously, they could have stood up on their own. These clothes came clean in warm water. I was shocked. Another thing I love about this detergent is the smell...or lack thereof. In addition to tp hoarder, I'm also weird about smells. My laundry just smells clean and fresh. Even my workout clothes that get that awful dank sort of musty smell after a while; you know they smell even after being washed; even those clothes smell clean in that they don't smell. I love that. I wear a beautiful expensive perfume I bought in Bermuda. I don't want the smell of my clothes covering up that scent. I'm going to add Grab Green Natural to my subscribe and save.",

I switched from Tide-like detergents to powder detergent with misgivings but this product disproved all of them. This powder detergent cleans well, does not leave residue, and leaves clothes feeling good. I am hooked for good.While it's nice they have a fragrance free option, I absolutely love the Water Lily fragrance. You don't need to add any other fragrance product (no beads, no dryer sheets) and laundry comes out soft, smelling fresh and delightful.You need to follow the instructions on quantity thoroughly. I roughly measure only half or even less than half a scoop of detergent for a regular laundry load. I sometimes use a powder bleaching agent. Both go into the bottom of a top loading machine before laundry items.",

I wonder if the company will release more of their various scent's in loose powder form.You gotta wonder what the major big brands put in their blends, fore I found that a lot of the dark wash water is actually the color from the fabrics coming out, which is why jeans fade so soon\ud83e\udd14A little of the product DOES go a long way!! Bath towels seem softer too!!Hopefully this brand will always be available and the 4 Lbs sack of 100 loads + is cost efficient.Edit August 12/2019: STILL buying it... Works/ Washes everything so far.
