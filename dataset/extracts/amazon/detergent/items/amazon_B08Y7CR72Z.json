This laundry detergent does an outstanding job as far as softness and cleansing but I have to be honest that I didn't notice anything different as far as a scent goes. I was hoping the laundry would smell like lavender. It smelled very good but I couldn't tell the difference from using an inexpensive detergent. Again, the laundry was very soft and did smell good. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this or not but I do buy a laundry detergent here on Amazon by Tyler Candle Company. The scent is called diva. No I don't work for them and know this is not a plug for them, I'm just saying that that laundry detergent makes the clothes smell incredible but it's very costly. Anyway, I'm not unhappy or disappointed but I was hoping that there would be a difference as far as the smell of the laundry goes. Thank you for reading my review",

I did not find that to be the case, they were OK but I don\u2019t feel like they perform better than my normal HE tide or HE gain detergent. The bag did tear after the first use, and I couldn\u2019t really seal without using a paper clip or something to roll down the top of the bag and keep it sealed, there is really no noticeable fragrance other than the chemical smells so I\u2019m going to have to go with I would not recommend these. I washed with smaller loads just to make sure that I gave it a fair shot and I can\u2019t say that my clothes were cleaner or smell better or that this product outperform any thing I\u2019ve used. I mean honestly I feel like the Gain and the Tide are much better cleaners. And I\u2019m used to using the crystals for fragrance and these pods just can\u2019t top those.",
