You use a full sheet for a large load..and 1/2 sheet for a small or medium load. Clothes come out clean and fresh. Price point is excellent as well. No more luging big plastic jugs of detergent home\ud83d\ude01 I will be switching over to this exclusively once I use up my current detergent. I heartily recommend.",
