For a very big or dirty load, I use a sheet and a half. It's easy to modify just as with liquid detergent. The scent is very mild. I love not storing and dragging around the big detergent jugs! So glad big changes are coming for modern laundry needs! I use fabric softeners as I would with regular detergents and so far still use wool lite black for dark clothes. This is a wonderful product for modern families!",

There is minimal smell when you open the package that disappears after it\u2019s been open a few days. My laundry doesn\u2019t smell great when I open the door after it\u2019s finished washing. But seems clean? Overall, it seems to clean. I just wished it smelled clean as well. But, it\u2019s hard to find a natural detergent with smell that isn\u2019t toxic.

I even did several tests with these to see how well they would clean. Too my surprise each test I did the clothes came out clean. I have been telling everyone about these. They are great for the environment, and they really do an amazing job!!! I wish I could give 10 stars!!!!",

It is convenient to just toss in a sheet though. The packaging is horrible though. I don't get who designed the packaging. One long box with two packages within. Why didn't they just put the two packages on top of each other inside a smaller container? Or just put it all into one container? Waste. Given the choice I would not buy these again and go for a known brand. Because I just don't see any suds and the clothes come out smelling normal. I even used one full sheet for a small to medium size load and the clothes had no scent after washing. I don't want a huge scent of course, but I would like them to smell like something.",
