It is the only one that actually gets my hunting gear clean with very little detergent, and it really kills all the enzymes that give up your location to the powerful nose of a whitetail.BUT- this last order came with the cap barely even threaded on, it was loose enough to leak more than half of the detergent into the bag it came in. It's a waste, it was a mess- the bottle was covered in detergent, and I literally had to try to carry the bag to the washer from upstairs, and attempt to get it in the machine so as not to waste any more than it already had.Disappointed by an otherwise amazing company and awesome product.",

Separate occasions I have been well within 20 yards of deer and not once was busted (for scent), so it\u2019s fair to say it does it\u2019s job. Note that I also use just about every other product they sell and keep all my gear sealed away in a tote with the scent killer tote thingy. 5/5 works great",
