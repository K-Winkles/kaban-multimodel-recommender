                "reviewText": "Got a pack of these for a trip to India. Concept seems great! Even comes with 2 sink plugs, and they were perfect.Maybe it was me, maybe it was the water? The suds disappeared after 20 seconds. And then it just seemed ineffective. Listen, I probably did something wrong. Who knows.Bottom line: next time I would just get a tiny Nalgene bottle (10ml?) and fill it with detergent. \ud83e\udd37 Less plastic waste and I know exactly what my detergent does or doesn\u2019t do. Sure, regular detergent will do a number on my skin, but this stuff simply left me wanting for more. I let my hotel do the laundry, which ofc ended up costing \ud83d\udcb0, no surprise. Bummer. But I didn\u2019t want half washed clothes. I want undeniably clean. So maybe that\u2019s on me for buying something meant for sensitive skin. Was gonna give 3/5 but I\u2019ll add a star, because I don\u2019t think you can make good (very effective) detergent that\u2019s safe for sensitive skin. Feels mutually exclusive, so fine - 4/5 it is.YMMV but I won\u2019t buy this again unfortunately. Good luck!",
