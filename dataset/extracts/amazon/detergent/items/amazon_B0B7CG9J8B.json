After 6 purchases, I'm cancelling my subscription due to persistent shipping issues. The bottle was regularly placed loose in a large package with other items-even food items! The lid was never secured and it would come loose and leak every time. 3 times were minimal and easy to clean up. Twice I had to call and get the entire box refunded due to most of the bottle spilling and ruining food items and paper products. This last time, it caused so much damage to the box that it was determined to be undeliverable by UPS and I had to call customer service to get the items refunded and then purchase all of my subscribe and save items separately without the subscribe and save discount. It was a really unreasonable situation and I would strongly recommend skipping the subscribe and save option and purchasing the item separately.",

                "reviewText": "Updated review November 19, 2003:I feel its important to update a review when I find out I was wrong. Well, I was wrong in thinking I was ripped off because there was not 1090 ML as adevertised on the label. Actually, I ran out of this detergent yesterday and I used about 1320ML. That's actually 230 MORE millileters than stated on the bottle!!!The ONLY detergent that gets out tough stains better than this stuff is Persil. And the difference is very very very small. So small I miight even be just umagining there is a difference when there is none really. I have seen a study that said Persil is 2% better so, I might be influenced by that study.I think I perfer Persil because the smell of the washed clothese is better than Tide. Other than that reason, Tide is the clear winner based on value and performance for value..So, I change my rating to 5 stars from 3.Original July 29 review:The container I received is about 3/4 full.OK, so I've used Tide PODS for a long time and I admit this is the first time I've ever bought the liquid jug. So, maybe the jug is supposed to come 3/4 full. But if that is so, it's a waste of plastic, since its not like a powdered product which \"settles\" during shipping.Maybe it was properly shipped and I got the full amount. Maybe it got turned on its side and 25% of it leaked out. I don't know.I do NOT believe there are 37 FL ounces (1090 ML) of Tide detergent in the container that was delivered to me, on July 27 from Amazon. I measure my detergent in a shot glass, before pouring it into the dispenser. I usually use 1 ounce (30ml). But sometimes I use 1/2 ounce (15ml), Tide does work so well that I can get away with such a small amount. I'm keeping a log of the usage of this container and I'm really confident its NOT going to add up .I average 4.5 loads a week. So, this Tide should last me somewhere between 8 to 16 weeks. Again, I am keeping a log. I will come back and update this message when the container is finished.So what I am saying is, I will not be buying Tide from Amazon until I can confirm I didn't get ripped off. Nothing against Tide, it works great, but I'm convinced that some of the product was removed from my container before it got to me, either accidently or otherwise.Value For Money: 3(Will upgrade to 5, IF it turns out I got at least 1060ML of product.For Sensitive Skin: 5I've never had a problem with Tide, nor has anybody I've ever known.Scent: 2I really hate the scent. I know the majority of the world grew up on this scent. But personally I always regret doing that first wash because I always forget to try a different scent.",
