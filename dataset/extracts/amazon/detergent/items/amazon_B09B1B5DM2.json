I purchased detergent sheets; however, after several months of usage, several shirts started smelling musky. Even though the product touted having enzymes, it wasn\u2019t strong enough to clean the shirts well enough. After reading reviews, I took the chance and ordered this Molly\u2019s Suds active wear detergent. I was glad it took care of the musky odors right away and, although I would have preferred a fragrance-free alternative, I am pleased with its performance and have been able to tolerate the scent.The only thing I wish is that the packaging/scooper be not made of plastic and be eco-friendlier. Regardless, it\u2019s still a benefit overall because it\u2019s much smaller than a bulky liquid detergent bottle and cap.",

We have two athletic teen boys so you can image their practice clothes and uniforms!We use 2 scoops every time and so far the clothes feel, look and smell clean without flowery chemical smells. Both have sensitive skin and regular detergent was making them break out.We use the New Zealand dryer balls, add a few drops of essential, to round out the cleaning cycle.Thank you!",

We had no problems with the first bag. The second bag does not work. It does not dissolve in the washing machine tray. We have used both hot and cold water. I tried pre-mixing and then adding. It just does not dissolve, which leaves clumps of hard detergent. Manufacture was emailed and have not heard a response back. Very disappointing for a $25 bag of laundry detergent!",
