                "reviewText": "I absolutely love using these laundry detergent sheets. Takes less space than those bulky liquid containers and a lot less on the mess too! There's no spilling over or measuring. Just count the number of sheets you need per load size. And wow, look at the price!!! $10 for 200 sheets which can equal up to 200 loads or more. You can even cut them in half if needed. They are much easier for my teens to do laundry too. They dissolve quickly and more importantly for me, my grandson has sensitive skin and has not had an issue from using these in our laundry. Also, a pet peeve of mine is that it's impossible to get ever last drop out of the liquid containers. Using these sheets eliminates that waste. There's no telling how much detergent and money has been lost. Another important thing to mention is that using these sheets helps the environment. It eliminates all those plastic containers. I love that!So....Cost friendlyNo messNo wasteSensitive skin friendlySaves storage spaceEco friendlyI definitely recommend giving them a try. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to like these sheets because of the price and convenience, but they only clean lightly soiled clothes in hot water. They don't remove stains in cold water. They dissolve just fine, and the water feels soapy, but the cleaning capabilities just aren't there. They do leave a light, fresh, and clean scent. I probably won't buy them again though.",
