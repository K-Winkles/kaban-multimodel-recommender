My husband will get a rash all over his back when I use other detergents like tide, persil, even free and clear detergents. This one does not bother anyone's skin and I love how they even offer scents. Most sensitive detergents are scent free and I hate that. These have nice soft scents and you feel like your clothes are actually getting cleaned. I used to sort all of our laundry and do my daughter's separate and with this I do not have to. This is our go to detergent from now on. The eucalyptus scent is nice too.",

                "reviewText": "My dog has really sensitive skin so I decided to get laundry detergent just for his clothes and dog beds. The smell of the detergent right out of the bottle is kind of weird but once the clothes are washed they smell good. It does have a slight vinegar smell but once it's washed you can't smell it anymore. I don't normally use the caps when putting the detergent in but this I did for several loads mainly because I wanted to see how much I actually needed to get the clothes clean. The one load I did had a couple dirty towels that had a bunch of dirt from drying my dogs off after they came in from playing outside. I used just below the first line and it got out all the dirt out of the towels. The directions say to use just below the second line but I used half that and the stuff came out clean. I always try to use as little as possible to make things last longer and you really don't need much of this. I'll probably end up trying the other scents to see what they're like. Definitely a good buy!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m have been quite happy using 9 Elements Laundry Detergents and Fabric Softeners. I wanted to be more environmentally aware and selected 9 Elements for its simple approach to cleaning that is both effective and still environmentally friendly. I had been using Tide for decades sure that it was the answer to clean laundry. I am pleased at how well 9 Elements cleans our clothing and linens. I enjoy a light scent of laundry products as 9 Elements has. It\u2019s like a small treat for me for doing laundry. ;) I love the Lemon scent. I am not keen on the Eucalyptus scent; it\u2019s just not for me. Others will enjoy it. So I was delighted to try the Lavender scent and wishing there was a matching scent in Fabric Softener. At this time, there is not. Now that I have purchased a large size of Lavender scented Laundry Detergent, I find that the scent is not truly detectable. Aww! Boo hiss! No scent? Where\u2019s my laundry treat? So if you desire an Unscented 9 Elements Laundry Detergent, THIS IS IT. The only other criticism I have of this and many laundry products, it is nearly impossible to see the fill lines inside the cap. I wish 9 Elements and every other laundry product would fix this to make the lines quite visible even to lower vision consumers.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the Nine Elements Lemon scent for over a year. It was a very mild scent that I couldn't detect after drying but now is discontinued.. The Lavender is just horrid just like some fabric softeners that you can't get the smell out. I have washed my load of laundry 5 times and still cannot wear the clothes washed with the lavender scent. I have tried Vinegar, baking soda, Borax and an unscented laundry detergent unsuccessfully. I will just have to give 2 towels, 3 jeans , socks , pajamas and 3 shirts away. They are ruined.",

                "reviewText": "We use the lemon scent and lavender scent, but haven't tried the eucalyptus yet. I'm sure all the scents are lovely, there's certainly no smell of vinegar, but has the cleaning power of it. I like that this detergent is natural, cleans well, isn't harsh on the skin, smells good, reasonably priced, and hasn't ever produced a build up like other natural laundry detergents.",
