                "reviewText": "This was my first time trying detergent sheets to do laundry. I didn't even know they existed until I saw something about them in an article online so I searched on Amazon and found these. I chose this brand mainly because the sheets didn't have to be torn like some others I saw and the price was great. I was very skeptical since I've always used traditional detergent, but these work great! They dissolve super quickly and have a very mild smell. My laundry came out of the washer clean and smelling fresh without harsh artificial scents which only mask the smell. I like that it's so easy to use - I use one sheet for small loads, 2 for medium or large, and 3 for extra large loads. I just throw them right on top where the water comes into my top-load washer and every load comes out perfectly. Because there is no coloring in them I don't have to worry about getting blue stains on my lights like I do with liquid detergent. Also I did not use fabric softener with these, whereas I usually used the liquid detergent with fabric softener in it. I didn't notice any difference at all with the softness of my laundry without the addition of the fabric softener. I'm very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it. It would be great for traveling due to it not being liquid and it's very lightweight, and perfect for those who use a laundromat because you only need to bring what you need. I will definitely order these again and even give as gifts because I don't know that many people know about these!",

                "reviewText": "I love that these not only help save our landfills from being filled with plastic bottles, but they also save space in my laundry room. No more having to store big, bulky jugs of detergent! The sheets have a very pleasant scent that is not overpowering. Cleans clothes well. It is very convenient if you use a laundromat, as you can take just what you need to do your loads of laundry. Also great to take with you while traveling, as you could even use them to wash a few clothes in a sink or tub. Put them in a bag with your dirty clothes until time to wash them, and they will help you dirty clothes to not stink up the rest of your packed items. You could also put on in your laundry hamper to keep bad smells at bay until laundry day. Then just dump into your washer along with your clothes and you are good to go! These were the least expensive laundry sheets I could find, they clean well, help reduce plastic waste, and save on storage space, so they are a win, win, win, win!",

I love the fact they\u2019re not contributing to our overflow of trash and recycling! I\u2019ve never liked the pods because they have stained my clothes. Don\u2019t use the powder and the liquid jugs are heavy and use a lot of plastic to make! These sheets are incredible! No staining, clothes come out clean with no lingering smell and so convenient to use. We are planning a trip overseas and these will be in my luggage!! Unlike other brands, these are individual sheets so there is no tearing to separate and they are less expensive! I put them in an empty plastic tub and they all fit perfectly! I\u2019m getting my 87 yr old Mom hooked on them! Jugs of detergent are so heavy for her! The sheets are perfect! One of the best purchases I\u2019ve made! Thank you so much!",

Great for traveling, and makes your suitcase smell great as well! Definitely worth it! And it\u2019s more economical than liquid, which is mostly water. Definitely going to subscribe and save on this one!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using these for several months now and they work great. I bought the scented ones and the smell is not too strong; leaves clothes smelling clean but not overly perfumey. I haven't had any trouble with them failing to dissolve or glomming onto the tub of my washing machine except maybe once when I went overboard and put too many sheets in, and the small amount of residue on the side of the tub just dissolved on the next round of laundry.The sheets take up so much less space than liquid detergent or pods, with no leftover plastic jug. And it's kinda nice to know I'm not paying for water with my soap- the washing machine adds that anyway, right? If you have little kids or elderly people around who think pods look delicious, these should solve that problem.Detergent sheets also have to be the greatest thing ever for laundromat and college dorm use- no more lugging liquid, hoping you don't squish the pods on the way, paying for an overpriced box of whatever detergent is available, etc. Same reasons make them great for travel.So I'm now a laundry detergent sheet convert- and I think these particular ones are very good. I will be using them until the next great leap forward in laundry soap technology, which will hopefully involve a robot who can sense when the hamper is full and do the laundry for me while my 102 year old self is busy living in a virtual reality GenX paradise created just for old people.",
