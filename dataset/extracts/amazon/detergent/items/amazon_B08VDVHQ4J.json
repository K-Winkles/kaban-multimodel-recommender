                "reviewText": "I purchased this 97 pack for my parents last year who have a front load washer. Mom has Alzheimers and she would forget to use detergent or use the wrong amount in the dispenser.....this was just easier for them to throw in a pack in the tub with the clothes and wash some laundry.I have been going over weekly as they are getting older and needed much more help than I realized. I am not a fan of front load machines so I took 1 of these pods and put it into a gallon of HOT water with a few of their \"clean\" small items that I was going to throw away. The items were dingy whites and had minor old staining and no odor. I let it soak for a few hours in this bucket and was completely shocked to see the water muddy and filthy dark after an hour of soaking. I need to stress here how filthy dark the water was as I never expected these items were really that dirty. The water looked like I was washing an old pair of brown tennis shoes and completely opaque with grossness. This was my version of prewashing at their house because I don't trust their machine. In any event, I LOVE these pacs. For prewash soaking, they are amazing. If their machine allowed for soaking, I would have used that option, but at least I was able to actually SEE how well these do perform.I used these pacs that day because their subscribe and save order for the odor blaster pods had not come in yet. They like the odor blasters scent too but I could only use what was on hand. So this is just ANOTHER Arm and Hammer product that earns 10 stars. These don't have much of a scent to them that I noticed. When all of their laundry was done, I did not smell anything at all after the dryer. Not sure why these 3rd party sellers offering this now think we will pay any price they are asking.....these are for sale at Big Lots for about $10 for the 97 pack.At my parents' home, their city water is hard with a TDS of 250. 1 pack of this A&H in 1 gallon of hot water makes the water feels slippery without excessive bubbles. If you have hard water, you may need to use 2 packs in your washer depending on the size of the load, the hardness of your water, and how filthy your laundry is. If you have a water softener or soft water, probably only 1 pack is needed. I have noticed that this removes the laundry smells better (completely) if I mix the pack with hot water first then add that gallon of hot water/detergent to the FL machine on top of the clothes. Just something I noticed when comparing how I do the laundry at my parents' as opposed to when dad does it. Either way though, there has never been any discoloration to items or undissolved packs. It's is foolproof, cheap and effective.",

Of course , it\u2019s easy to use because it\u2019s in pod form but I like it because it gets my clothes clean and they smell fresh and it\u2019s low in suds ! Don\u2019t get me wrong , I like Tide for really dirty clothes but Tide makes a lot of suds for a regular wash and then my machine stops and the suds light comes on . Arm & Hammer is an old and trusted name . I am so happy I tried this detergent a couple of years ago . Because of the low suds , I don\u2019t have to rinse my clothes on a second rinse to remove extra soap suds .",

                "reviewText": "My wife is one of those people who think only a certain brand of detergent will get clothes clean. She also prefers to use liquid detergent. To me the liquids are messy - a little always leaks out of the big bottles with the spigot and the cups have to be rinsed or thrown in with the laundry.So, I saw these on a deal at Amazon and thought I would give them a try. When they arrived she wondered why I dared to question her laundry expertise and try something else. Told her it was an experiment....and since I do my own laundry I prefer to do it my own way. Yes, that was quite bold on my part!!Long story short. these little Arm & Hammer Power Paks work exceedingly well. My big white bath sheets are even whiter than when they were when washed with her \"Big T\" brand detergent. I don't have to clean the detergent cup or clean up any little detergent dribbles off the top of the washer. On top of that, it is a lot cheaper, too.Now about those complaints that the Power Paks don't dissolve. I have used 30 of them and haven't once had that issue. Maybe it is possible but I think these must be some sort of operator error involved - overfilling perhaps? We have a front loading HE washer for reference - no problem for me to this point.By the way, the other day I was headed out to the garage and walked by the laundry room. I noticed that my wife had her hand in my bag of Arm & Hammer pouches. She was using my detergent! Perhaps she will become a convert after all.....at least we had a good laugh about her filching my \"cheapo\" laundry soap.",
