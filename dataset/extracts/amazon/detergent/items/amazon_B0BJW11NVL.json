I do not rinse my dishes before I load them into dishwasher except to remove chunks of food. 100% of the time the dishes emerge completely clean and sparkling. Not sure if result of this product or my high end dishwasher. I once let a big tub of these get old after opening After several years the pods seemed harder than I woukd have liked. Used anyway and they worked beautifully. Even if you don\u2019t use the dishwasher a lot you can still buy these in a big size as the work great even when old. I have never used the \u201cregular\u201d only the platinum so I can\u2019t compare them.",

                "reviewText": "Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your aprons, because I'm about to take you on a journey through the culinary cosmos with the Cascade Platinum Plus Dishwasher Pod! This little pod of wizardry has been a hilarious and utterly surprising addition to my kitchen, and I simply can't resist sharing my side-splitting review:1. Dishwashing Dungeons & Dragons: Using the Cascade Platinum Plus Dishwasher Pod feels like embarking on a quest through the legendary Dishwashing Dungeons & Dragons. It has +10 cleaning power and +20 against stubborn food stains. No dish is too mighty for this dishwasher pod to conquer!2. UFO of Cleanliness: If this pod were an unidentified flying object, I'd swear it came from another planet of clean. It's like an alien technology that beams down and zaps away the dirt, grease, and dried-on mac 'n' cheese.3. Fizz-tastic Fun: The moment you drop this pod into your dishwasher, it's like a science experiment happening right in your kitchen. The fizz and foam party that follows is better than a kid's science fair volcano eruption. You half-expect a mad scientist to pop out and give your dishes a high-five.4. Dish Spa Treatment: It's like sending your dishes to a five-star spa. They emerge from the dishwasher looking rejuvenated and ready for their close-up. I'm convinced my plates now have skincare routines.5. Stubborn Stain Wizard: Tomato sauce, coffee stains, baked-on cheese, you name it \u2013 this dishwasher pod is like a wizard with a wand, making even the most stubborn stains disappear into thin air.6. Dish Dryer's Paradise: This pod doesn't just stop at cleaning; it's a master of drying too. My dishes come out of the dishwasher with a sparkle that rivals the twinkle in a diamond ring store.7. The Morning After Party: I now look forward to the \"morning after the party\" because that's when I open the dishwasher and am greeted by a gleaming spectacle. It's like my dishes had their own party and are now giving me the grand reveal.8. Squeaky-Clean Socks: I once accidentally put a pair of socks in the dishwasher along with the dishes (long story). Let's just say, Cascade Platinum Plus left my socks so clean, they squeaked when I walked. Who knew it was a laundry detergent too!In conclusion, the Cascade Platinum Plus Dishwasher Pod isn't just a dish cleaner; it's a kitchen magician, a UFO of cleanliness, and a dish spa all rolled into one. It has turned my dishwashing routine into a comedy show, and I can't stop applauding its hilarious and incredible performance. If you're ready to elevate your dishwashing game to a side-splitting spectacle of cleanliness, then the Cascade Platinum Plus Dishwasher Pod is your ticket to culinary cosmos domination. Be prepared to be amazed, and don't forget to invite your dishes to the party \u2013 they deserve the royal treatment too!",

                "reviewText": "I got two 3 packs of these as free samples from the local grocery store, and was AMAZED at how well it cleaned EVERYTHING, so I ordered this big pack from Amazon.Their advertising is spot on, I didn't have to presoak a single dish, & it even got the hardened food stuff off my ceramic coated frypan that NOTHING had been able to get off.My greasy, hamburg-covered stainless steel frypan came out SPOTLESS! All the dishes were free of water spots, despite the nearly unhealthy levels of hardness of our water.I was absolutely DELIGHTED.Until I saw what it did to my Mirro pans. Mirro pans are amazing - they don't rust, they're easy to clean, & are inherently non stick. They aren't sold anymore, unfortunately, but you can still find them on eBay, which I had done. But, as I'm disabled & was having a really bad pain day, I put them in the dishwasher, just like I always do when I can't wash them by hand.I've never had a problem before. In fact, the square Mirro pan in the pictures was originally my parents' pan, which they bought over 40 years ago. It's a bit banged up, but the 'mirror like finish' still shines, despite 4 DECADES of hand & dishwasher washings. These pans are tanks!However, this Cascade soap, it DEMOLISHED them. I'm shocked at how just one run through completely destroyed my Mirro pan.One picture shows 2 Mirro pans I'd bought at the same time. Their finishes were identical. However, the bottom one is the one I'd put through the dishwasher with these Cascade pods.The other picture shows those same 2 pans aa well as the square, nearly 50 year old, Mirro pan that had once belonged to my parents. You can see that even after almost half a century, the finish on that square pan has no issues whatsoever.But that one I put in the dishwasher withthese Cascade pods, just ONCE, is completely ruined.So, yes, I do recommend these pods for most dishes, & especially if you have hard water, but NEVER use them with t Mirro pans!!!I'm keeping a backup, less harsh dishwasher pod on hand to use with my Mirro pans (& a few other, more specialized dishes, like my countertop mixer's metal bowl, because I don't want to find out what Cascade would do to IT'S finish!) in the future when I need to, but will be using these Cascade ones for everyday dishwasher use.(I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it destroyed 2 of my Mirro pans.)",
