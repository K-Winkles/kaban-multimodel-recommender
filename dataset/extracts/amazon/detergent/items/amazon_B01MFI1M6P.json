While it may be a little more expensive than some other brands, if you (like me) have skin problems and sensitive skin, and don't want to chance bargain brands, Tide is always the way to go. With Tide you always know that the quality is worth the few extra pennies per load, and this particular one w/Downy scent is really good. It kind of freaked me out at first while I was expecting Tide scent (guess I should have read the description, huh?) I was pleasantly surprised. I love both scents and love how clean my clothes were and how soft they were and how great they smell.",
