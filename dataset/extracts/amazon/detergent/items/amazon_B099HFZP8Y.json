I\u2019m also not a fan of clunky detergent bottles and our house has limited space, so I was drawn to it for its size and packaging, as well. I\u2019ve been using this for a few months now and my experiences have been positive. Everything gets clean and smells pleasant. I usually just use one pod per load, unless it\u2019s a very large load.",

                "reviewText": "These do clean nicely, but they are very very concentrated detergent. I have a huge capacity new front loader GE washer, which washes and rinses clothes perfectly, and to try this detergent I only filled it up to the 2/3\u2019s capacity so the clothes can really move around well for cleaning, and also rinse soap out clean. I used just ONE of these pods and it left a pasty residue on the clothes even though the clothes were not overly packed into the drum. And it was a medium sized load. I had to wash the whole load again twice with no soap to get the soap out. So, if you are NOT washing a FULL size load, these have too much soap in a pod. Later I tried doing a little larger than 3/4 size load and it seemed to be the perfect amount of soap.It\u2019s a drawback that you can\u2019t customize the amount of soap for a smaller load because they are only in one size. I wish they offered half load sized pods.Also, I bought the Fresh scent and it smells almost exactly like baby powder. It\u2019s similar to Dreft baby detergent. If you like that smell, then you will love the Fresh scent, and the scent holds on well even after drying and storing fabrics.Despite the limitations and baby powder smell, really like the zero plastic packaging, and I think it does clean the clothes very well if you have an almost full load. So, I\u2019m going to order the Lavender and Spring scent and try those, but I won\u2019t use these to wash smaller loads since it\u2019s too concentrated. And hopefully they offer this in other sizes for smaller loads.",
