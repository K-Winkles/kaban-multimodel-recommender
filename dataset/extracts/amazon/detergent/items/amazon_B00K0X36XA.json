WIN\u2019s only byproducts are oxygen gas and zero-impact soaps. It is septic safe and has minimal environmental impact. Synthetics say to wash on cold because of the high pH of most detergents. With WIN it is safe to wash on warm or hot, getting clothes cleaner and brighter.",

They run A LOT and they sweat A LOT, and their clothes were becoming gag-inducing smelly. I washed with our usual, free & clear detergent (no fragrance due to sensitive skin, so no masking bad odors). I recently opened the warm dryer and was HIT in the face with awful odors...running clothes that came out STILL smelling like sweat and B.O.Enter this detergent. This wonderful, yet more expensive detergent. We have been using it for running clothes and not only can I now open the dryer without gagging, but the clothes actually no longer smell! And this is still the fragrance free detergent we're using.It costs more than our usual detergent, but it gets the job done and is SUCH a relief.At least for now, I don't have to burn icky clothes or throw them far, far away. The detergent is that good.",

Clothes would still be a bit funky after this process. After looking for a laundry booster I found WIN. All I know is, straight after workout clothes go in laundry machine just a couple ounces of WIN, and it comes out smelly great. Stuff is amazing. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I use this for all my microfiber and performance fabrics. The smell has dissipated substantially. I found Win by scouring the web for why my gym clothes have an amonia-like smell, and this and another one or two brands popped up. I would recommend the soaking of clothes with a capful an hour or so before washing them for best results. I did my laundry without soaking first the other week and could detect a slight smell from the clothes when I went to the gym. All my clothes get hung dry with an occasional lowest-heat dry for reference. Also, some of my clothes I have owned for a year or so prior to getting a performance detergent and being a student, I don't always have the time, money, or quantity to do a small wash with just the clothes needing this, so there may be a care component missing. I would love to see further development of this product, for a little more aggressive smell-lifting, but I am no chemist. Great Job Win, 9/10",

                "reviewText": "This product has been great with removing odors while maintaining the integrity of the fabric. I can safely soak clothes with this detergent knowing the various fabrics and elastics won\u2019t break down. I use the Green version. Clothes removed from the washer and dryer smell fresh, light, clean, no lingering odors. Almost like a natural spring line dry type of clean scent. No perfume smells.I\u2019ve used other similar products that have destroyed and broken down fabrics after a single use. WIN has been wonderful.The real test of clean comes from wearing the laundered clothes, no residual scent build up occurs during normal/high activity. This helps simplifies my future washes, too, less wash loads/soakw to remove built up odors.A family member heavily uses coconut oils full body and the oil mixed with bodily oils and scents heavily clings to their clothes, making odor removal challenging, if at all possible, when using other detergents. Odor removal was challenging even with repeated same day multiple soaks and washes.I switched up detergents and now use WIN and Biokleen Sport using two washes. First wash is WIN with a short hour long soak. Second wash, I use Biokleen Sport, then move clothes to the dryer. No more overnight or long duration soaks and repeated wash attempts to remove odors.I purchased the 64 oz and a little goes a long ways. I now use it in all my washes and I typically, but not always, do a small to medium load of laundry once a day. The 64 oz bottle lasted 3 months.",

                "reviewText": "After all the trial and error with numerous brands, detergents that claim they clean workout clothes, all do just that but leave a chemical smell to them no matter how little liquid is used. Come this brand. Small amount goes a long way. 1/4 cap for even the largest loads.Scenario: a weeks worth of workout clothes sitting in the laundry basket. Some clothes are sweatier than others and some years of use. After using this sports detergent, the clothes come out sweat free and no weird rashes from potential harmful chemicals like other ones I've used. I opted for scent free as you are working out, not going to some nightclub. 2 orders later I'm still using this as it simply works.",

                "reviewText": "I'm giving this three stars because it does work, however, I had to pre-soak and wash my bras three times before the smell was gone from them. It's probably because despite washing them with normal detergent the funk built up over the months, but my main issue is the price for the amount that you get, it's expensive and also does not include a measuring cap nor directions on how much soap to use per each wash. I ended up guessing how much to use and I have no idea whether I used too much or too little.I do appreciate that the green bottle truly is scent free though, and I do recommend it to others because it is the only detergent that has managed to get the funky smells out of my bras and workout clothes. I just wish it was cheaper.",
