                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical because my favorite product is the snuggle softener pods, but these were the next best option and I must admit that I\u2019m very pleased with them so far. They smell absolutely wonderful, and the clothes actually smell well also for quite a bit of time. I definitely recommend this product, if you loved snuggle, you will definitely love these",
