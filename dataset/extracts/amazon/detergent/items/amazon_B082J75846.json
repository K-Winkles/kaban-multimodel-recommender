                "reviewText": "I took one star away as the pen I received was broken and the scent sachet was not very scented so I ended up adding a bit of detergent to the balls to jazz it up. The tip of the stain remover pen popped off immediately which bummed me out as my son had a stain on his favorite sweater and I had just received my order so I told him no worries, I can get it out only to find out the pen was defective. I ended up opening it up and manually spreading some of the liquid around and to me, it seemed like it was just more of the detergent! Did nothing to remove the stain which is whatever as I ordered the set for the detergent. Might want to check quality of the pens you're sending out, maybe they're expired or something and not worth the extra work! Detergent is good enough as is, smells so heavenly and my husband is even a believer now! I have given little samples to my besties and they all agree, it smells BOMB! I feel so boujee when I get dressed and I love how it makes my whole house smell lovely during washing. Im just sad I never heard about this stuff before! I also ordered High Maintenance and was less than thrilled, nothing at all compared to Diva! Never stop making this stuff, my husband told me to start ordering gallons of it lol. Hes a chef so his work clothes smell like food and its always been a struggle to lift the odors but Diva has done the trick! A capful and 1/2 and we're in business!",
