                "reviewText": "I truly love tide pods. They are the absolute best. I got these for on sale for 16.95 and they have been a tremendous help. They remove basic to moderate (when soaked) stains well. Clothes smell fresh and great. On a scale of 1 (no scent) to 5 (overpowering scent), I would rate these a 3.I do not have terribly sensitive skin, but my skin is temperamental and so far, these have caused no issues in terms of irritation.",
