                "reviewText": "I've been using Forever New for many years. It was recommended to me by a specialty bra store. They said that a washing machine, hot water and regular laundry soap wears out the elastic in bras and that this hand washing with Forever New would make bras last longer. I'm for that! After soaking your hand washables for a few minutes, this product takes the soils out with cool water. I use Forever New on anything to be hand washed. Just follow the directions...it's easy to use and worth it.",

Would have preferred the unperfumed version but that doesn't seem to be available in this size. Started using Forever New after making purchase of Prima Donna lingerie which was a large expense so wanted to ensure they stayed in good condition - hence being forever just like new. So easy to use, just add warm water to disolve and soak your bras for 5 minutes before rinsing. What could be easier?",
