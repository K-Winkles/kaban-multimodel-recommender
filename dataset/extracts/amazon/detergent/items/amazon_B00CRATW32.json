This detergent has exceeded my expectations in every way.First and foremost, its cleaning power is outstanding. Plus, it's gentle on fabrics, so I don't have to worry about it damaging my favorite garments.What sets Mrs. Meyer\u2019s apart is its eco-friendly formula. Knowing that it's biodegradable and free from harsh chemicals gives me peace of mind. It's also suitable for both high-efficiency washing machines.The fragrance of the detergent is subtle yet pleasant. It leaves my clothes with a clean, crisp scent that lasts for days. I appreciate that it's not overpowering like some other detergents on the market.",

I recently moved into my bfs place and he was using the T brand( full of toxic chems;look it up;) anyway, it made me extremely itchy, especially at night and I didn\u2019t really care for the scent. So, I decided to get this again. Price is good and I remembered the smell wasn\u2019t over powering ( if you don\u2019t like strong smells or wear perfume) I didn\u2019t want to mix a highly scented laundry soap smell with perfume smell..and it clash. Anyway, I got this and washed my bfs clothes. I had put his clothes away and the next day, when he came home from work, he changed out of his work dress shirt and into a laundered basic tee and we cuddled on the couch reading antique finds, I kept smelling something that smelled good. It was him. But, it was a faint, but lovely scent and I kept getting wifts of it ever so often. I looked up at him as he was going through the photos, eyeing him suspiciously. I would go back to looking through the listings and finally I couldn\u2019t take it;I NEEDED to know what that smell was!; I buried my face into his shirt, snorting it up like a manic ( not literal) and realized it was the lavender. He looked down at me with a bewildered look and all I could muster with a smile, was: you smell nice.This is my opinion. But it is a nice- relaxing,subtle, scent. I will keep repurchasing.",

I bought the lavender scented detergent because I like it, when I poured it in the washer, it smelled just like lavender.

This detergent cleans very well, and I have the peace of mind knowing that it isn't putting harmful chemicals in the water system.",

So yeah they stink bad by the time I wash them. I was using a full cup of detergent a full cap of scent beads n 2 cups of enzyme laundry booster n there was always still n underlying musty odor. I have tried so many combinations of things I am using 80 bucks worth of products a minimum of 3 at a time just to try n kill the smell totally. I decided I wanted to see if just one product could do the job. I tried this n both me n my husband were amazed. Hot water, 1 hour soak n I did use a second rinse setting, there was no smell at all!! I didn't have to wash it a second time or even add extra product. I added exactly how much it said n there was no smell to them at all. I smelled no lavender which is the scent I got but I don't even care lol I am just so happy that I can buy n just use 1 thing to clean them n I don't have to wash them twice. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke I repeated the process with my rat n guinea pig fleeces n once again 1 wash n no smell!!! I can't even express how happy I am. My husband told me to order 9 bottles so we don't ever run out I didn't do 9 but I did just order 4 more.",
