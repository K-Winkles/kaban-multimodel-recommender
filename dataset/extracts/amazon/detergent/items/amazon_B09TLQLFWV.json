I have washed every load of baby clothes with this wash for 8 months, and I love the way the smell stays in the clothing even after the dry cycle is completed! I have started washing our blankets and towels with it as well due to the wonderful scent that remains in everything after using! The only downfall, every time I receive a new bottle it is leaking. The issue isn\u2019t big enough to take away a start because the product is that great!!!If you\u2019re on the fence I\u2019m here to tell you it is so worth it!",
