                "reviewText": "6-27-17I finally received the Lemon Verbena scented detergent yesterday. It took a bit longer because I added it to my 'Subscribe & Save' order, I wanted to take advantage of the cheaper price doing so.I washed all my sheets, pillows (9), quilts (2), and a regular load of clothes with it so far. I did about 5 loads with it so far. So scent going into the wash is comparable to the \"All Surface Meyer's Cleaner\"... I love it. Coming out, it becomes more subtle. It still somewhat smells like the cleaner, but oddly enough -to me- it smells even more like a fresh, clean, newborn child. Being a mother, this is the scent that resonates with me more. The sheets and bed items I washed were my own. The scent was so pleasing... taking me back to when my daughter was an infant, the scent was soothing to sleep with. I'll have to post an update with how long it lasts. As far as the regular load I did, there were greased covered garments in it. They seem to have come out quite well... I still have the really heavy grease stains, which I expected. They'll never come out in any detergent, but the greasiness and stench are completely gone, which is what I look for.To those who don't know what the Lemon Verbena cleaner smells like, I'll try to express how I think it smells. It's not lemony as one would expect because of the name... this is an herb, which in fresh picking smells lemon-like... sort of like Lemongrass. Although when used in the products, or at least the cleaner, it has a fresh, invigorating, herbal scent. It just makes me happy to smell it. lol Almost like an odd side effect of an essential oil, such as how lavender has more of a calming effect. But like I mentioned above, the scent is more subtle in the detergent, especially after washing & drying.I like it and will be ordering more in the future. I should add that a little goes a long way, and even more so in a front loader. One 64oz bottle should last 64 loads according to the label and the cap measurement. I, however, used slightly less... to just below the ridge of the cup/cap. Front loader washers don't NEED as much soap, so this could easily last up to 70 loads. I added the full amount when it came to the greasy, grimy, regular load though.As far as the Bluebell scent... I love this scent even more. I think I'll use this more for the clothes and the Lemon Verbena for the sheets, pillows, & maybe towels just because of how the scents resonate with me. They both clean very well. Everything comes out looking & feeling clean. I'm glad I picked these up. The products have certainly won me over.I bought this from the seller \"Amazon.com LLC\", which I feel is important to list this info. I've come across sellers with variances in their items, including knockoffs, even if listed as same brand. I'll post an update with what I find on longterm use.",
