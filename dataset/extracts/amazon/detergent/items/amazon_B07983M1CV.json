                "reviewText": "I \"discovered\" Method cleaning products one year when my son came out to visit. He's lived overseas for the past 15 years - starting in Australia. Those Aussie's tend to be pretty green with their products and when he saw I was still using the same laundry detergent I'd used all his life (the same detergent my mother used) he \"suggested\" I try Method. In all fairness at the time it was less than HALF the price of my old detergent; but, being of the old school and having tried other \"green\" products that just didn't work I wasn't particularly open to it. He said he'd buy it because his girlfriend wasn't going to wash her clothes until they got back home because of the detergent I had and all the chemicals in it and, frankly, he didn't want to take dirty clothes back to Aus when he could wash them at Mom's!The old saying, \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" is NOT entirely correct. I was impressed with the small amount you needed to use and yet the clothes came out clean and SMELLING clean. (It makes me crazy when I see those commercials on TV about a \"scent freshener\" you add to your laundry to make it smell clean. If you wash your clothes in a detergent that works -- your clothes should smell clean because they ARE clean!!) Anyway, that was 6 years ago and I've been using Method Laundry Detergent ever since. I like that my clothes are clean, it's good (not bad) for the environment, and even though it's not as easy to find as it used to be (thank goodness for Amazon), it's available and still cheaper than the \"national brands\"! If you have sensitive skin or have little ones and infants, this product is safe for you as it doesn't have all those nasty chemicals that our national brands do. Definitely a win-win!!",

It cleans my clothes well without any residue. My goal has been to clean up those added chemicals manufacturers ad to the brands that we use on our bodies. I feel better today about the products I choose today. I like that now I have options. This option of detergent for me has been a great transition . The scents are very nice and not overwhelming at all. They have many different scents and also make an unscented variety.",
