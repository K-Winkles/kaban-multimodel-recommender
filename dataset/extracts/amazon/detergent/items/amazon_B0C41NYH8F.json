                "reviewText": "These detergent sheets dissolve into fragments as soon as they are hit with water, but they need to be submerged to completely dissolve. The water didn\u2019t feel soapy with just one sheet, so I\u2019ll probably always use two with my usual large loads. Although these unscented sheets contain no fragrance to mask odors, I only found one garment that still smelled faintly when spot checking. The load contained synthetic shirts, underwear, and hiking/camping socks, so I felt the laundry sheets passed the cleaning test. There was also a ball cap with a sweaty headband which I pre-treated with stain remover, but the stain remained. In addition to reducing plastic in most households, these take up less room, and will travel with me if I need to do laundry on a trip. As for price, I\u2019m probably only going to get 30 loads for the current $15 price (50 cents per load). Given the convenience of home delivery and the form factor, that\u2019s not too bad compared to my powdered detergent from the big box store which could be as low as 25 cents per load, but is probably slightly higher, and would be higher still if it was formulated for sensitive skin. I\u2019m impressed with these and would recommend them.",

We used a large sheet for big load and a half sheet for smaller loads\u2026I gave each of my kids a some to take with them for the summer as they are working in different locations. That said, it is a great travel product and my husband is taking some with him on a camping trip\u2026Over all a great product - I\u2019d recommend to a friend, definitely!",

                "reviewText": "These laundry sheets have been a vacation sanity saver this summer so far! We travel a lot with our 3 kids. Mostly camping and it is so annoying to lug around a big plastic bottle of detergent. Many a cap not tightened and liquid spills in the gear! Or buy the little boxes of powder in the laundromat machines that never fully wash out and end up with streaks of dried powder on clothes after drying. As you can imagine, all the camp set up, hiking, biking, etc. will test your deodorant, and win. Clothing and bedding get dirty quick! And the camp fire smoke smell. While making s\u2019mores and drinking wine around the campfire at the end of the day is a must to any camping trip, the clothing really takes on the strong smoke smell and is not so pleasant to wear the next day.We try to not pack much per person, so washing frequently is imperative.These sheets were perfect for this past month long trip. So easy to slip the pack envelope if sheets into our gear and have at the ready when coming across a laundromat. Not only was the ease of just throwing the sheet into washer, our clothes always came out clean and NO smelly odors!! Unbelievable with 3 kids exceeding their normal wear and tear on their clothing for dirt and smell!I highly recommend these for any camper, vacationer, or just at home.Another huge plus for us is knowing we are not adding to the land fills with big plastic detergent bottles. On a normal basis at home we go through a big red bottle of blue detergent once a month. That plastic adds up. I\u2019m sold on this product.",

                "reviewText": "I've really started getting accustomed more or less and liking using detergent sheets although initially I was skeptical due to how the come and feel when you are holding the sheets. Thinking \"this\" is going to actually clean my clothes? They dissolve almost immediately when in contact with water in the bottom of your washer drum. I have a top loading type. I typically use 2 full sheets due to my clothes being more soiled than normal from work, that and I do larger loads besides.I've been happy with the results using these they do a good job with removing the smell left from your deodorant and/or sweaty pits. I can't speak for those that use antiperspirant as far as how it builds up on clothes being I only need deodorant.",
