                "reviewText": "Recently tried out Sheets Laundry Club, and as a busy individual, I appreciate the no-fuss approach it brings to laundry. Here's my comprehensive take on it.First off, major props for being a US Veteran Owned Company \u2013 always great to support those who've served. Now, onto the product itself. The idea of detergent sheets without the plastic jug is quite innovative. It's lightweight, easy to use, and definitely helps reduce the environmental impact.The unscented nature is a plus for those with sensitivity to fragrances. The real game-changer for me is the liquid-less technology \u2013 no spills, no mess, just straightforward laundry care. The convenience of up to 100 loads in 50 sheets is pretty impressive.Considering allergies and sensitive skin, Sheets Laundry Club has proven to be a blessing. The subtle, lingering scent left on clothes is perfect, ensuring it doesn't trigger any sensitivities.Pros:- Mess-free- Gentle on sensitive skin and allergies- Convenient Subscribe and Save/Autoship option- Space saverCons:- Slightly Pricier",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical of trying these laundry sheets, based on reading various reviews of people complaining that the sheets did not fully dissolve. I decided to try them, and I really like them. I like that the packaging is compact and easy to access, and easy to recycle. I usually tear the sheets in half and toss them into the washing machine before adding my clothes. When washing blacks, I typically use the extra rinse cycle--although I do these for those laundry pods too, to make sure that all the detergent is rinsed out of the clothing. Initially I opted to try these out on those things that I dont particularly worry if it gets destroyed--like kitchen towels and cleaning rags, but tried it on my regular clothes after liking the initial results. I have purchased a second box, and will probably transition to using these sheets as my primary laundry detergent.",
