                "reviewText": "My husband has really sensitive skin, and this detergent seems to agree with his sensitivity. Also, it cleans really well - even his clothes that get super dirty from working outside. It seems like it used to have a stronger scent. Maybe I just got used to it so it isn't as noticeable, but I liked the scent and miss smelling it.",

I didn't want to rate with lower stars because the performance of the product is on par with the other scents. It's just the smell.",
