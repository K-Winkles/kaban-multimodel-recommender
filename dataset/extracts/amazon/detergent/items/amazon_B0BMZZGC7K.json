I use one sheet for load that is mildly dirty, or two for dirtier loads. In summer I wash most loads in cold water, in winter I use warm. My water is on a purifier for well water, which I think also helps with cleaning. I don't use fabric softener. These work fine for me. The scent does not persist but isn't really needed anywayFor people who want to reduce using plastic and reduce shipping of a heavy jug that mostly contains water anyway, I think these are a good option. They are also easier than pouring out of a jug, and no spills for an older, sometimes clumsy person like me.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to try and buy SHEET LAUNDRY detergent to save plastic waste. It is scary to see plastic bottles floating in the oceans. This is the first Laundry Sheets I have ever purchased.1)I was really impressed by this product. It came in a small box that is great for storage. It would be great for anybody limited on space. Rv's, efficiencies vacations etc.2)The scent is mild but pleasant. I do smell it on my clothes faintly when I wear the clothes. It is not overpowering.3) I am a messy person. I like cooking and it is not unusual for me to get my clothes greasy or stained. I had a white tank top that had many various stains on it. Every stain came out but the rust from my caste iron skillets and some very dark oil. It cleans well. All my regular clothes come out clean.4) They don't suds, but you will see the water getting dirtier.5) They dissolve quickly. I hold them in my hand on a rop loading machine and they dissolve in seconds. I am not sure personally how the world dissolve in a front loader but I am sure it will work on top loaders because most of them have wather running through them.6) They are gentle on my clothes and don't make me itch. ( I am nor allergic but some protects cause me to itch.)6) As I am on a fixed income, I searched for the most economical product on Amazon..This is the lowest price I found for a QUALITY product.7) NOTICE: These sheets DO HAVE perforations to split each one in two pieces. They are not easily visible. If you take the upper to edge and pull gently it will tear in two equal sheets.8)Each sheet is made for one SMALL LOAD. I use 1.5 sheets for a full top loader. I full sheet for medium sized loads. If the clothing is dirty or smelly, I add a 1/2 sheet more on large loads ( total of 2 sheets.)All in All I am pleased with this product. I plan on buying them from now on. I am pretty traditional,so it is not common for me to stray from.life long habits. Realizing that WE ALL have to do our part to keep the planet safe for the next generation. I was using \"Pod\" products. They do reduce except for the heavy plastic they are packaged in. I can recycle the cardboard this comes in right into my garden. That is a plus!",

I haven't noticed residue or color changes. I wear a lot of black for work and so far no signs of residue! The fragrance is light and clean (fresh linen) for large heavily soiled loads I use 3 sheets. I haven't tried less, but I have just followed previous comments.",
