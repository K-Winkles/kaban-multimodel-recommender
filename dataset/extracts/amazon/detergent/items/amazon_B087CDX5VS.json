                "reviewText": "This is the only laundry detergent I use. since discovering it three years ago. The slim packs are space saving, and they work like a charm. I even toss one in my luggage in case I need to wash something in the hotel sink while traveling. Dissolves quickly and easily. I've never had an issue with clumping. (I do use cold water so that may be a factor. However, the few times a year I do use hot there's never been an issue.) I run large loads of athletic apparel, kid clothes, stained pet blankets, towels, sheets, etc and always use half a strip. Clothes are perfectly clean every time. No weird chemical smells, just clean clothes. I average a load a day so that means I get 1.5 months out of ONE pack. I average a savings of $150 a year in laundry detergent using these. Interesting aside: I once used dryer sheets, but these somehow cuts static cling completely. Which means I save another $60 a year in dryer sheets totaling $210 savings per year using this product. Thats REAL money. I order a full year of these packs at a time. The satisfaction of passing the laundry aisle and not entering, dragging home huge plastic jugs of toxic goo, tossing all that plastic into the garbage.....priceless. I'm such a fan that I set a few aside and gift them to friends. Take the leap, spread the word, this stuff is magic in one, little sheet!",

I waited to make my judgment until I\u2019d been using it for a couple months. They work the same as my All Free and Clear (also unscented) detergent that I\u2019ve been using for ... a decade? \ud83e\udd14 There is no scent at all to this that I can pick up on. I\u2019ve noticed no difference in cleaning power. I\u2019m also not generally rolling in mud, so I\u2019m not sure what would happen with big time stains, but I frequently spill or get grease splatter while cooking on my shirts that I pretreat (usually with dish soap) and have had no issues with stains not coming out in the first wash. It\u2019s essentially double the price per load of those big, heavy jugs of laundry detergent, so it might not be feasible cost-wise for everyone right now. However, it comes in super small, light packaging made of paper/cardboard, so it\u2019s easier to recycle. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

I will continue to use this well into the future. We also take this in an envelope when we travel to hand-wash items as we go. Lightweight and easy to pack.",

                "reviewText": "I took these on a trip to wash my clothes and it was quite easy to use and effective. The strip doesn't just give off the detergent and then stay there, it dissolves completely. As long as it's dry it's a solid, get it wet and it turns into detergent. Easy to use and very useful. Great item for handwashing and I think for a machine as well.",

I did price comparisons using unscented Tide as my baseline, looked into 3rd party testing and certifications, and compared reviews. After all of that, on paper these were the winner, and in practice they exceeded my expectations. 100% recommend",
