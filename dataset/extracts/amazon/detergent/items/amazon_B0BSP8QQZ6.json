                "reviewText": "I decided to give Persil a try. Especially with many good to great reviews (not only this site, but others, overall). Well, I must say, I was pleased with this detergent - with one \"flaw\" if you will. Get into that in a short bit. I am pleased (overall) with the cleaning ability and how it gets your clothes and other items smelling fresh, with it's clean and appealing scent. It reminds me of nostalgia days when my mother did lots of loads of laundry and the scent of freshly clean cloths waffling through the air. I think you know what I mean. Like many now, I have a HE washer and while great in many regards, I've been finding the disks do NOT always dissolve completely. In fact, with each load there is AT LEAST THE DISK RESIDUE STUCK ON MY ITEM(S). I mean stuck! WTH, I have a new HE washer, and Persil discs are supposed to clean IN ANY TEMPERATURE water. It doesn't even dissolve fully in very hot water. A rea bummer and disappointment, really. I've had some issues when I need to use cold water and at times, but also many times, warm or hot. The disks either partly dissolve or they've left small pieces of these disks STUCK on some items after the wash cycle was completed. Not good. Especially when a product professes it's complete ability to dissolve in ALL temperatures of water; cold water included. I do place them according to instructions and that's the result I've gotten some occasions, to be fair. I tried other ways of placing the disk in the machine, but again, this happened. One piece got stuck on my husband underwear. Yeah, I know. On a positive note, I DO like this detergent for the most part. And when it cleans and \"behaves ;) \" all is grand. Truly. As mentioned earlier, I do like the scent and it smells great even a few days after. I don't use fabric softener any longer either. Also like the packaging of this particular carton. Recyclable. Great. ALL brands need to follow suit. Their containers though, from what I can tell, are not recyclable. Why even make these or continue? Eventually all those plastic containers won't be produced - a GREAT thing, but why wait?Persil's cleaning ability is good overall and I'd recommend. Just watch how or where the disk is placed. (And of course never in the soap dispenser) plus the possibility of not dissolving entirely, in Cold water. I've added to this review and am NOT happy with the disks. Period. I have to rewash some items where the disk was stuck like a glue. Arrg.",
