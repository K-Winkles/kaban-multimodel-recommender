                "reviewText": "I have been raised up in a Arm & Hammer family for as long as I can remember doing laundry as a child at the house I stayed in I remember always using this. My grandmother used the powder but I\u2019m not a fan of that and have a HE top loading machine. I love this can be used for both machines. I filled the cap to line A like it say\u2019s doesn\u2019t look like much but I know how good arm and hammer is! That little bit is all you need, with any arm and hammer detergent, luckily I don\u2019t have a toddler with very sensitive skin I do know all toddlers skin is more sensitive so when I saw this I decided to get it! I have tried different brands to get a more \u201cfree & clear\u201d detergent but I have came to the conclusion that nothing other than this truly works for toddler stains and dirt and gets rid of the musky smell of sweat and dirt and stains. They have a more free and clear version but honestly I\u2019m not worried about that anymore nor need it when the other detergents from arm & hammer haven\u2019t irritated his skin or ours and this is the first sensitive skin jug I got and what\u2019s funny is I have the odor blasters 106 loads in the big dispenser jug and this is 105 loads in 108 ounces and the jugs say the same line for medium loads so I\u2019m bit confused on that unless you use more in the other one. I got sensitive skin mainly so my son doesn\u2019t get irritated because things can change in a day with toddlers. I love having nice smelling clothes and using less detergent than other brands had me use and only $9 for all this that\u2019s a deal the other brands I was paying $12-15 for a bottle. I pair the detergent with bounce sheets only dryer sheet I have used and recommend as well. Love the 2X more cleaning power so it can be used in both machines without having to use a different amount of detergent as I always look for that. It\u2019s a win win with arm and hammer and I\u2019m a user for life and not going back to tide or all or ecos (ecos sucks) and tried seventh generation before didn\u2019t like it and was too much money. This is unbeatable and should be the most used laundry detergent in America and in households my mom used it as well and still does. Highly recommended and can\u2019t wait to pop clothes out of wash and dry them and see how clean they are.",

                "reviewText": "I was a faithful Tide user for years before switching to Arm & Hammer Sensitive Skin Free and Clear. The reason for the switch was due to a sudden onset of skin allergies. It's not as bad as some people get but was bothersome so I went to see my doctor. I was given a diagnosis along with some allergy meds and a specific lotion for flare ups. I was also advised that I may want to look into products geared towards sensitive skin as this may end up being a recurring problem. I tried out Arm & Hammers Sensitive Skin Free and Clear and really liked it. I've been using it for a while and when I went to purchase this last time, it was out of stock. Not wanting to switch brands, I saw this Arm & Hammer Sensitive Skin Plus Fresh Scent and decided to order. It arrived timely and was boxed well with no leakage.I did laundry as normal and everything came out looking, feeling and smelling clean as I expected. I don't use fabric softener or fabric sheets due to the amount of athletic clothing we have. I use wood dryer balls instead. The detergent is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested, making it a good option for people with sensitive skin. As far as the scent, it's fresh and mild and has not caused me any issues.You get a 105 fluid ounce bottle (approx. 105 small to medium sized loads) for the current listing price of $8.06, which is very inexpensive when compared to some other brands. I haven't had any skin problems since switching to Arm & Hammer so it will remain my go to brand for laundry.",
