What a bunch of whiners! It smells fine. I probably wouldn't have even noticed the difference if the bottle was orange. The liquid is still blue. Works awesome on my husband's dirty muddy work pants! Cannot believe how huge the bottle was for only $6 CDN. Insane deal. Wish I'd ordered a few more! Item is currently out of stock, but at a price like that... we will definitely be ordering more! Can't beat not having to lug a massive heavy tub from the store either. Delivered to your door in 2 days... oh yes thanks!*** TOP 100 REVIEWER, PLEASE HIT HELPFUL IF THIS WAS USEFUL!
