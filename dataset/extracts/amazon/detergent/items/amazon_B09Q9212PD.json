I used them on a trip when I had workout clothes that I needed to wash in my hotel tub (hotels charge way too much to wash clothes!). They were convenient to pack and I just dissolved about 1/4 sheet in the tub water before washing by hand.",

                "reviewText": "I first tried a different brand of laundry sheets that is heavily marketed. It seemed fine at first, but I ended up getting a girly infection and read in the reviews that I wasn't the only one. I realized after the fact that that brand was not as eco friendly as I thought (although it is free of plastic). I'm glad they started a movement, but now I'm happier with this product. It's more eco-friendly, and no more infections. I use two sheets or each large load and our clothes seem clean. The product is a little pricey, and I wouldn't mind a fresh scent but it's more important to me that it's healthy. This market seems to have really blown up and I'll probably try other brands, as long as their eco profile measures up.",

                "reviewText": "I looked at reviews and tried one other sheet-detergent brand and feel satisfied with Eco Roots. Most notable and positive is the dissolubility of the sheets. The other brand I tried did not dissolve in cold water in my washing machine--it left gooey, undissolved pieces. Eco Roots sheets dissolve easily and completely in cold water. I never need to rip them up or dissolve them in warm or hot water. This is a huge plus. I am also completely satisfied with how the Eco Roots sheets clean my clothes. I use one full sheet for a regular load and my clothes come out smelling and feeling clean. The only downside is that they don't come out of the dryer with a nice, fresh-laundry scent--instead they smell neutral. I am willing to accept this because I am sensitive to chemicals and often get migraines, so I'd rather no smell than a heavy chemical smell. I have previously used Method laundry detergent, which I love and which smells great (not too intense), but I am willing to give it up for a more eco-friendly, non-plastic laundry solution.",

Hello earth lovers, what a great way to cut back on plastic.Secondly, this product is a breeze to use...just tear off a sheet, and put it into the washing machine.If you travel, this is amazing...bring your own laundry detergent which takes up less space than a small envelope!It cleans just like the brands in plastic jugs, so a win for you and you can do your part for the environment.",

Up until now, I would\u2019ve given them five stars. Easy to use, great for travel, can use for hand and machine wash, space saver, unscented, hypoallergenic. All the things. But now I\u2019m not 100% sure if everything is getting as clean as before (feeling confused).",
