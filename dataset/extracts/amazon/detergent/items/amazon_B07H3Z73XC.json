                "reviewText": "I wasn't looking forward to trying this detergent. I have been using Sun & Earth for YEARS ... more than a decade at least. They must be going out of business because I can't find it anymore. So I had to find something else.Prior to using S&E, I had tried everything under the sun and I was allergic to ALL of it. I don't care whether it talked about being hypoallergenic or not - I had a reaction. Even baby detergents!I'm the kind of person who can't switch anything - not soaps, shampoos, detergents ... nothing. So I was apprehensive in trying this. I bought a bottle at the grocery store before coming online to buy these dispenser bottles. I have to say, I'm in love. I like the lavender scent. It's weird for me to smell a scent on my clothes, towels, etc., so it's taken me a bit to get used to it. But I like it. It's not strong at all (sometimes it is because it catches me off guard, but in reality, it's not strong at all).I haven't had an allergic reaction at all. That's key for me.I love the dispensing bottles. No measuring. Just squeeze. Every time I do the laundry I'm tempted to add an extra squeeze, but I don't. And no one in my family has complained that things aren't \"clean.\" My son is 26 and does his own laundry, but the thing I'm noticing is his clothes don't come out of the washer quite as stinky as they usually do (you know that boy/man smell .... ICK).This is the only detergent I'll be buying from now on ... until 7th Gen goes out of business that is!",
