The fact that they are scent-free is a huge plus, especially because two of my granddaughters have sensitive skin.The convenience of these sheets cannot be overstated. They take up very little space in my luggage, and I don't have to worry about any liquid spills.Each sheet dissolves easily in water and effectively cleans my clothes. I found that three sheet was sufficient for a big load of laundry, so the 32 loads in one pack lasted me quite a while.Not only are these sheets great for traveling, but I also use them at home. They work just as well as traditional liquid or powder detergents, and I appreciate the eco-friendly packaging.Overall, convenient, effective, and scent-free, making them a versatile choice for anyone on the go or looking for a more compact laundry solution.",

No gross perfume smell either.Pack easily, don\u2019t take up much space. Thin sheets, worked well in warm water.",

The Enyur laundry sheets are definitely a great travel companion! I liked that the sheets come in a compact, decent plastic box that I can pack in my suitcase and take it with me easily \u2013 this also provides me with peace of mind that the detergent sheets won\u2019t get damaged during traveling. It\u2019s very easy to apply the appropriate dose by following the table shown in the box. Further, the detergent sheets are very versatile since they work in any type of laundry machine \u2013 whether standard or high-efficiency \u2013 and work great to remove stubborn marks that always happen while traveling, such as ketchup, carbonated beverage, sauce, etc. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this product.",
