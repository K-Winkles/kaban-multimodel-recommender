This one has more than just detergent in it so it\u2019s all in one. Smells good. No need to put too many of them. I put 2 for almost a full bag of laundry and 1 for some towels( I do use oxy with it too though). I like the simpleness of it the most.",

So easy to use, just toss one in, no measuring or wasted soap by using too much. Just a great product all around. Highly recommended.",
