                "reviewText": "These laundry sheets have revolutionized my laundry routine, earning them a well-deserved five-star rating. The convenience they offer over liquid detergent or pods is unbeatable \u2013 just toss a sheet in with the laundry, and you're done!Not only are these sheets easy to use, but they also exude an environmentally friendly vibe, reducing plastic waste associated with traditional detergent packaging. The light scent they leave on the clothes is refreshing without being overpowering, creating a pleasant, subtle aroma.One of the standout features for me is their gentleness on sensitive skin. My daughter, who struggles with eczema, has experienced no irritation since we made the switch. It's a relief to find a product that not only simplifies the laundry process but also considers the well-being of those with sensitive skin.In conclusion, these laundry sheets are a game-changer for anyone seeking a convenient, eco-friendly, and skin-sensitive solution. Five stars all the way \u2013 highly recommended!",

So I got these, they seem to wash well. His clothes smells clean but not with that heavy perfume smell that he hates. The sheets split in two. I use the whole sheet. U can split for smaller loads which is a plus. I'll be buying again.",

                "reviewText": "There are nothing but positive benefits to using these laundry detergent sheets. It works, costs a fraction of the price of the detergent I've been using, creates practically no waste & is easy on washing machines. I have a large family & the Giant detergent jugs take up a lot of space in our garbage & cabinet, plus sometimes they leak out a bit & create a soapy mess. I wish I had discovered these sooner bc I've basically been paying for mostly water in a jug that will only contribute to an ever growing mountain of trash.",
