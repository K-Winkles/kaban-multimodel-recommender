Instead of pouring the liquid into a measuring cap like most other brands, this one allows the user to bypass this altogether. As many consumers are now becoming aware, these concentrated detergents don't actually require too much for an impactful wash, so it certainly helps users regulate and prevent overestimation. The scent is nothing to write home about (or a review) but fine nonetheless.",

My only complaint is this most recent purchase, someone at the factory must not have screwed the lid on tight enough because a good 1/4 of one of the bottles was all over both bottles, the cardboard, and had leeched through to the larger cardboard box Amazon delivered it in.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If I could give 3.5 stars I would. This does a great job getting my clothes clean! I want to emphasize that, butthis particular scent is not great. It smells like one of those colognes that are overpowering. I plan to buy a different scent next time.The bottle design is a great idea in theory, but in reality it leaks all over the place. I always end up with laundry soap all over my hands and on my dryer. I feel like it's kind of a waste if the soap is all over the dryer instead of my laundry. I get about half a loads worth of soap on the top of my dryer every time I use it. I just wipe it up with something going into the washer, but it seems silly to have to do that.",
