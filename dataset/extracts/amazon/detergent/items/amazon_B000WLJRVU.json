Dropping to 4 stars instead of 5.Original:Love the light scent this leaves on my clothing. Cleans well too, as with any detergent I do add white vinegar for extra cleaning power when neccessary.",

This is not the first item I have purchased multiple times on subscribe and save (whatever sure it is) and then they try to price gouge me saying its no longer available unless you pay double!
