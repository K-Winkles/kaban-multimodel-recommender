                "reviewText": "Discovered this laundry detergent years ago and love it. Scent it is natural and not overwhelming. Only the slightest whiff of it is left after the dryer. No need for any type of fabric softener the wash and works great with wool dryer balls only in the dryer. Usually a bit of static when I pull something out, depending upon the type of material, but all it takes is one good shake and the static is gone. I'm a single lady so I can't speak to what happens on family muddy grass stains kind of clothes, but for me it works perfectly and I love it. Strong scents drive me crazy and this is just pleasant and natural.",

                "reviewText": "Cleans but need to use more than recommended amount and have found bedding, towels and sheets are a bit more rough, smells great and no harmful ingredients for the household, people or pets. It's hypoallergenic and biodegradable. Safe for greywater systems. I also like Seventh Generation. Have found I went through a bottle much quicker in my new place with a smaller washer, than with a larger washer. So for me the price per load of laundry is more expensive.",
