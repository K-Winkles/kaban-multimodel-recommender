Enzymes are bad for sheepskin, because they break down protein, which is what wool and leather are made of. A formula that is neutral pH and without enzymes is not enough when you also care about what chemicals are in your laundry detergent. You also want it to be natural, and made with ingredients that are gentle and soothing to the skin.

That's why we set out to formulate the best laundry solution that would be safe for sheepskin, wool, and other natural animal fibers such as silk, cashmere, mohair, and also work well for plant fibers such as cotton and bamboo. We teamed up with professional chemists here in the USA whose values aligned with our own. They are a federally approved lab with the expertise and commitment to natural, sustainable ingredients along with factory practices that are considerate of the environment. A gentle yet powerful cleaning solution made of the highest quality ingredients. Cleans and softens washable sheepskin, wool items, silk, cashmere, bamboo, cotton, baby items, bedding, delicates, hand wash items, and also safe for delicate skin. Works well as a general laundry solution. No harsh chemicals. Includes the best wool conditioners nature has to offer. Works well in cold or hot water. Each bottle of Outback Gold is heat sealed immediately after bottling to prevent leakage during shipping and prevent contamination.

Lanolin has long been a favorite for its softening and protective characteristics. It can restore sheepskin and woolens, and make them more water and dirt repellent.

                "reviewText": "I was gifted two used sheepskin rugs by some friends of mine and have had them for YEARS. I was told them washed them and dried them so they always looked a little rough. They were mostly put away in storage for some time but I decided I\u2019d like to try to revive them. After doing a little bit of research I dove in and got this!Washing methods: cold gentle wash in washing machine. I put one rug in at a time. I filled the machine half way with cold water, put about 1/3 cup of this washing solution, and a few tablespoons of baking soda as it had been years since they were washed. I let the rug sit in this solution for about 15 mins, then proceeded with the wash.Once done, I laid it out on my hang-drying clothes rack; the rugs smelled AMAZING, very gentle and light- clean scent. I brushed the hair with my hand only to get pieces to break up, took a minute or so. I let the rugs sit for several days to hang dry and put a fan on them during the day. You can see the after effect of washing on one rug vs not yet washed in the side by side pic :)THEN the part I was most excited about- after the rugs had air dried for several days, I purchased a wool rug brush ($7) and brushed for about a minute- and the last picture is the end result. I\u2019m so thrilled and impressed!!!! EASY to do if you have a few days of patience for drying! Skins look 100x better and crazy soft, and smell amazing!!!! 5 stars from me!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to clean our sheepskin rugs that we\u2019ve had for a couple years. They are by the bed so get consistently used but not a heavy grime area. I thought it smelled nice and cleaned the rugs well. It\u2019s a little pricey but overall I believe it\u2019s a good product. My disappointment is in the way it was packaged. When I opened the Amazon box it\u2019s interior was wet. I pulled out the item - wrapped in a plastic mailer bag - and it was completely coated in wet slimy detergent. When I opened the mailer bag, it was wet inside (actual liquid and small bubbles) and the lid was not on tightly. I don\u2019t think a ton of product was lost. I emailed the seller to let them know and it\u2019s been over three weeks and I did not get any response. They sell a higher end product. They should be responsive and take more care when sending orders out. I will probably repurchase this item when I run out but I will look to buy from a different seller.",

                "reviewText": "I used this to help restore a vintage military surplus wool blanket. The blanket was a bit stiff and had likely been stored for a few decades. It wasn't dirty or smelly but it was stiff. I used this as directed to wash it and then a lanolin wool restorer product to condition it. It came out great. Softer and not as stiff and the color is still vibrant. There was no shrinking. I will be using this on all of my woolens.",
