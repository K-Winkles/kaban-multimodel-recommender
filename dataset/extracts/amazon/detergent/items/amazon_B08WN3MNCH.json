I have the Ocean Breeze and the scent is barely noticeable (if you like a lighter scent on your clothes). I have sent boxes of these as gifts and am on the regular delivery plan so I never run out!!

Recently I cut several sheets into thirds and put in a baggie to use when rinsing out socks and underthings on a long trip. They did a great job and helped me pack for a ten day trip with only a tote and a small carryon bag. It was great not having to schlep a large suitcase through several airports and public transportation. When the grandkids come to visit I use these sheets on tablecloths, bibs and little tees to get out the food stains and fingerpaint that is so hard to beat! I love these also because they're good for the environment and lots easier than heavy plastic jugs!",

If you have been to Europe, you know that you have to pull your suitcase up and down stairs, onto trains, small sidewalks (if they have them), or on cobblestones. There is a lot of walking required and lightweight luggage is a must! We wanted to be able to pack fewer clothes and wash along the way. These detergent sheets (plus a travel clothes line) made for a good solution.I stored the flat detergent sheets in a ziplock back in my suitcase. When washing laundry, I tore the sheet into pieces before adding to wash so that it would dissolve more easily. We were very pleased with the clean laundry on our trip. The price was way more than I wanted to pay, but it did provide us with a solution for having to bring a lot more clothing on our trip. I would recommend.",

I tend to use two sheets with a normal-to-large load, and maybe one in the pre wash, if necessary. So for me, they don\u2019t last 60 loads, but they\u2019re still good value.Because a family member is sensitive, I use the unscented version, and it really is unscented! I use white vinegar as the fabric softener, which also leaves no scent, and my laundry is always just clean.These sheets don\u2019t leave any kind of residue, and I love that the packaging is so small and compact.I waited to use quite a bit of them before leaving a review, because different laundry might do better with these, but these are great with the hot water blasts with bleach AND the cold water gentle washes.I\u2019m happy to recommend these.",

My skin is sensitive and I have no irritation or problems with this soap.

                "reviewText": "I have been using another well-known eco friendly laundry sheet product but have found the last few orders of sheets have felt very plastic-like; hard to tear in half actually. Although they cleaned to my satisfaction, I thought I would try some alternatives. Having tried these I can say they dissolve readily and seem to be doing a fine job of cleaning all types of laundry. I appreciate that they are scented but not over the top. These sheets (as all laundry sheets I've look at) are made with PVA (which is still considered a plastic albeit water-soluble and biodegradable) but I suspect they contain less than the previous brand as the feel is more like a soft sponge vs. a firm, solid sheet. Currently using laundromat front load washers, I have found half a sheet to be more than adequate for a medium load - any more and you get way too many suds. I am happy with this product and will continue to use.",

I bought the Ocean scented sheets however I failed to detect a scent so I added a few drops of essential oil into my machine drawer. This did the trick.They are quite expensive and probably wouldn't be cost effective for a family but there are only two of us and we only do two or three loads of washing per week so it works out at a few pounds per month. They come in a cardboard box so no plastic and take up little room. I am also glad there are no nasty chemicals in them. The sheets are smaller than I expected them to be but they got my laundry clean so I'm not concerned about that.Overall, I am very pleased with them. Of course I wish they weren't so expensive but hopefully the price will come down as more companies start selling the same.Delivery was just a few days after the order.",

It\u2019s also fragrance free (but don\u2019t worry the laundry comes out smelling clean) and best of all it is mess free and helps our environment. Throw 1, 2 or 3 sheets in for heavy loads and you\u2019re done. No measuring out or wasteful pod packs. The sheets would be great for travelling too for any on the go stuff you might need.
