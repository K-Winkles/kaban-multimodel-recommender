Anyhow there was a time when an advertisement said, \"Nothing Beats Tide\" ... it is absolute truth in my book! Nothing smells the same as sheets washed in Tide ... well, any laundry washed in Tide. Its the hands-down FAV for me. I use powdered Tide Original scent for all my laundry needs. No need for stain removers, etc. I've found just a scant amount will clean well, but use more if needed for things like the dogs bedding, etc ... yeah, let Fido's bedding soak for a bit and Tide works wonders. NOTHING BEATS TIDE. :)",

This has gotten so strong I can't even use it I had to put it outside on my patio and if I use it in my apartment my neighbors LEAVE! The one from Vietnam is the best I have ever had and the smell is so fabulous! I don't know what happened to tide but they need to take it off the market or change the smell back to what it was! Sorry!",
