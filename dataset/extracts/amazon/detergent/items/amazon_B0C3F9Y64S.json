We are halfway through the product, and quite happy the results. Other allergen free options miss the mark. Many of those claim to be 'Oxy' cleaning power. Well, in our experience those didn't do as well as this product. The smell is pretty good, too. After running two wash cycles with this one from Tide, the armpit stains (left behind from former products) were nearly gone. It works for us, and white well.One suggestion, take a good smell of the cap in a physical store if you have the chance. It was a deciding factor for this purchase. This product, as they say, was best bang for the buck in the category.",
