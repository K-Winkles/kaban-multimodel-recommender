Not a hard thing to do but people would rather complain about them not resolving than take an extra little step first. These sheets do NOT desolve as well as others. But they clean very well. (I do spot treat dirt prior to washing) however Even that usually doesn't solve everything. But I did find everything, including my whites, looked cleaner. Very pleased with the product and price point. Stop lugging jugs and give this one a try!",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased these because I read about laundry detergent sheets online and thought if I could end my plastic detergent bottle consumption to put forth a little effort in preserving the Earth, then why not. I read the instructions, followed them, and these laundry sheets work just fine. They don't leave a perfumy scent on your clothes and they clean as well as liquid detergent. I have been using one sheet per load, although I did use two sheets for a large load the other day, and they worked great! I don't have very sensitive skin, so I cannot comment much on that, but I have not been itchy or irritated. As long as I can get these for the same or less than what I was spending on detergent, I am permanently switching and recommend everyone do the same.",

I totally recommend them! And they\u2019re not too expensive either, no more plastic jug in the landfill, it\u2019s a win-win!",
