                "reviewText": "I have senisitive skin and I tried this detergent on my compact washer and it is very thick liquid and very concentrated. It cleans clothes very well and removes odor from the clothes and stains. I wouldn\u2019t compre this to any other brand because other brands have more concentrated ingredients and it works more then this but this is good for when you can\u2019t get those named brand detergents and you need one until then. However when this came to me the package was not damaged but there was a massive leak in the box. The bottle and the cap was in good condition it just leaked I think amazon needs to put sealing around the top caps to prevent it leaking and also to have it packaged safely so it won\u2019t explode on the other items that come with this product. Overall though it is washer friendly and you just gotta use the right measurements and it will do its job right.",

My clothing comes out clean, smells clean and the color remain bright. The smaller container is easier to handle than the large bulky bottles I buy in the store. Less waste also. I will most definitely buy again.",

Its super concentrated and cleans our clothes as good as the expensive stuff. I would have given it 5 stars, But I have a few issues. First, they don't always have them in stock. and they prices goes up and down every other day it seems. We are a family of 5 and go through laundry often, so when I need soap, I need soap. Not a month later. Nor at double the price I paid 2 months ago for it. As much as I like this soap, I won't buy it often.",
