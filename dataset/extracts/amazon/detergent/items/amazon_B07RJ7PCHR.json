                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Convenient, Cost Saving, AND Cleans Nice & Bright!",
                "reviewText": "Bottom line: One laundry detergent packet cleans a larger load than the laundry detergent instructions suggest, so I\u2019m actually saving money on laundry detergent cost (and one of these containers lasts me longer than I expected), PLUS cleans better than I expected (I had been a loyal Tide Free & Clear customer), and these super easy to use, so this is a 5 star review.Extra Bonus & Important for folks needing to conserve water: I feel I am saving a bit of water because these laundry detergent packets avoid needing second rinses on dark colors to avoid powder residue.Detail: I originally purchased these laundry detergent packets with some hesitation but I had to because during COVID \u2018empty-shelf days\u2019 these laundry detergent packets were \u2018all I could get.\u2019 Very glad I did! I think these laundry packets get clothes cleaner and brighter than the Tide Fresh & Clear powder that we used to use pre-COVID.These laundry detergent packets are very handy. I was worried about two things: 1) That the little pre-measured laundry detergent packets would burst in the container over time and make a mess. THIS HASN\u2019T HAPPENED IN MORE THAN ONE YEAR OF BUYING THESE. I haven\u2019t had any issues with any bursting or disintegration of the detergent packets. If anything, these detergent packets are neater than using powder because no more stray powder granules to clean up, no more difficult powder detergent boxes to open.. 2) That using these pre-measured laundry detergent packets would be way more expensive than the easier to portion control Tide powder Free & Clear. THESE PRE-MEASURED LAUNDRY DETERGENT PACKETS ARE FAR MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN THE TIDE POWDER WE WERE USING. This surprised me, but that\u2019s because each laundry detergent packet packs a whallop of cleaning power. I tested to see how big a load one of these pre-measured laundry detergent packet will clean well, and (if it\u2019s not super dirty) one packet can easily clean a large load. If there\u2019s deep staining then I use two detergent packets for a large load. I use two detergent packets for a super load. I have never had a reason to use three detergent packets, that\u2019s just overkill I think. My laundry machine is an old-school top loader.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:- Generally I don\u2019t need to add any fabric softener or anything else to my laundry load but a detergent packet.- The whites get noticeably brighter than with the Tide Free & Clear powder I used to use.- With the Tide powder, sometimes some powder would leave light markings (powder residue) on dark colors that required a second rinse to avoid. These All laundry detergent packets avoid the issue of powder residue on dark colors, so I can avoid doing a second rinse, which saves both water and money.- Color brightness comes out fine, if anything I\u2019ve noticed less dye transfer between colors when I\u2019m too lazy to separate colors well.- If there\u2019s a stain I generally do a Zout stain remover spray on the stain, and in my experience Zout stain remover spray works great with these laundry detergent packets.-In terms of the weight of carrying the container around, going from memory, I think a container of these laundry detergent packets weighs less (and therefore easier to handle) than a box of powder detergent.- In terms of neatness, the containers for these laundry detergent packets containers close nice and tight (a definite improvement over the powder laundry detergent boxes that can get sloppy and leave trails of detergent powder when you open them and carry them anywhere).Hope this is helpful info for you & that your experience just as good :)",

We use one pod per normal load in our HE laundry machine. Works great to remove stains and our laundry is always clean and fresh without a heavy detergent smell.We add the pod directly into the machine basin, versus putting it into the designated detergent tray. We found that the coating around the pod does not always break down all the way if we place it in the tray. It does break down enough so that the detergent is able to get into the laundry, however, it leaves behind the pod casing residue if we use the tray.We\u2019ve purchased this detergent many times, and anticipate many re-purchases.",
