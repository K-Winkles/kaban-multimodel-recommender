                "reviewText": "I used to use all of the expensive, mediocre, \u201ctrendy\u201d detergents that smell decent, but they really did not clean well at all. After years of struggling using those, I finally thought I\u2019d figured out a combination of products that worked, even though it has been SO expensive and time-consuming, even just to order the products and have them all at hand. I had heard about how amazing person was years and years ago, but I just brushed it off and could not believe that something so cheap could work so well. Lo and behold, my \u201cfavorite\u201d detergent is out of stock everywhere so I finally, FINALLY tried Persil.Well, I am ashamed that I was so wasteful and I wish now that I had discovered for myself how amazing Persil detergent is so long ago. This particular one is my absolute favorite scented laundry detergent there is, and this stuff actually works! The oxi kind with the orange on the label is my other favorite.. but seriously\u2026it just blows my mind!!! try it if you\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s so inexpensive compared to products that don\u2019t do half of what this stuff does. Liquid gold.",

Also I found it few days later selling for $9.99 at Walmart. Besides that it\u2019s certainly a great laundry detergent.",
