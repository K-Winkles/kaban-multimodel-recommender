                "reviewText": "Laundry detergent is a constant \"must have\" and since I have no intention of going back to making my own soap, purchasing is a \"have to\", often. As the current standard form for washers is liquid, buying in stores, and lugging it home has become an onerous task, so I am absolutely delighted to be able to get it on subscription so that it always arrives and I never run out. We like whisk because it both gets the clothes clean, using a modest amount, and leaves less goopy scent left on the clothes - you know that scent goo attracts dirt and other odors, right? I will be happy when the figure out how to make a concentrate that can be mixed with regular water somehow - thereby reducing the volume that has to be lugged or shipped, but I do understand that water quality variability makes that difficult for manufacturers, so, for now, this works. Very happy with both the detergent's sunctioning and the subscription service!",
