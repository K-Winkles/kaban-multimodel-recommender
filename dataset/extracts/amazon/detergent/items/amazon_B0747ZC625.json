                "reviewText": "Recently decided to skip the liquid box version and try out the pods. Best decision, wish we did it sooner! Somehow it uses less liquid than what i was measuring out prior to the switch but we actually see soap suds now! Also, the tide fresh scent is more present too which is nice. The pods help with not using the pour in container on front loaders, which afterward the detergent just falls down the side and into the drain part of the front seal if you dont time it right. Plus you're getting stain and color protection too. Less mess with the liquid, just grab a pod or two and toss it in! Super simple, worth the small extra price for convenience! Love tide pods!",

                "reviewText": "These work really well for my general laundry uses. There are a lot of benefits of the Pods over traditional liquid laundry soap. I'm not sure if all of these are covered in other reviews, but the benefits I see are as follows:1. Ease of Use for Beginners: For individuals new to doing laundry, Tide Pods can be a user-friendly option. The pre-measured pods simplify the process, making it less intimidating for those who may not be familiar with traditional detergent measurements.2. Convenience: Tide Pods offer a convenient and mess-free way to measure and use laundry detergent. The pre-measured pods eliminate the need for pouring liquid or scooping powder, making the laundry process more straightforward and a bit cleaner. Great for AirBNBs!3. Space-Saving: The compact design of Tide Pods allows for easy storage. They take up less space compared to large detergent bottles or boxes, making them suitable for those with limited storage.4. Reduced Spillage: The risk of accidental spills is minimized with Tide Pods, as the sealed pods contain the detergent securely. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are concerned about mess or have limited dexterity. The liquid type bottles tend to get a slippery-sticky lid that takes forever to rinse.5. Fragrance Options: Tide Pods come in various fragrance options, allowing users to choose scents that appeal to their preferences. This adds a personalized touch to the laundry experience.6. Travel-Friendly: The pre-packaged nature of Tide Pods makes them easy to take on trips. Whether for a weekend getaway or an extended vacation, users can bring the exact number of pods needed without the hassle of carrying bulky detergent containers.7. Preservation of Ingredients: The individually wrapped pods help protect the detergent from exposure to air and moisture, potentially preserving the quality and effectiveness of the ingredients until use.",

                "reviewText": "Tide Pods are an excellent laundry detergent. Using just one have my clothes clean in one washing cycle. The fabrics smell fresh, and the suds are rinsed out every single time. These pods also prevent making a mess on the washing machine, and I never wonder if I'm using too much or too little. After the washing cycle is over, I've never found a residual plastic covering from the pod. They dissolve each time without me having to worry about finding an empty one on the floor or in the dryer. Tide is the best, and I will be buying this brand every time I need washing detergent for my clothes.",
