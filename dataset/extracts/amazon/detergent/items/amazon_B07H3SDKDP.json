                "reviewText": "I'm a big fan of Seventh Generation products, and this new idea of theirs is really a great one. This is a super concentrate and it works as advertised. At first, it made me a bit nervous to use the small amount recommended. How can such a small amount of detergent clean all of my clothes, I asked myself. Well, Seventh Generation has figured it out: this small amount cleans just as well as any amount of any laundry soap I have ever used.Also, the EasyDose feature really works! Just turn it upside down, squeeze, and voila!, a perfectly measured amount is dispensed.I appreciate being able to help the environment by using less plastic and less fuel in transport of this smaller bottle. It's also nice that this bottle's footprint is smaller, taking up less shelf space. One note I would give Seventh Generation is that the small bottle tends to fall over and sometimes even shimmy off of our washer from the vibrations of the machine (we keep our detergent on our machine, instead of on a shelf). I would suggest they consider a wider footprint to the bottle.Note: This review is for the Lavender Scent and to me the scent is nice and matches the scent of the formula in the larger (less concentrated) bottles.Useful Tip: Per the instructions, make sure to tip the bottle completely upside down before you squeeze in order to release the correct \"dose\". If you hold the bottle at an angle, it will keep releasing detergent without stopping.",

The built in dispenser is perfect, as I don't need to measure, just squeeze into washer and Go!I love how economical this soap is as it lasts a long time and I do at least a load a day, so I appreciate that I don't have to buy laundry soap so often, as I am forgetful.Cleans dirty clothes well, normal sweaty clothes. I haven't tested it for cleaning toygh grease stains like say a mechanics clothes.",

                "reviewText": "One bottle received.Usually the so called Lavender scents of many products are not even close to Mother Nature's fragrances.As a matter of fact they are often too strong and chemical smelling.Seventh Generation has found a natural scent for their Lavender laundry soap with no chemically smell at all.Some of us are pretty sensitive to it so we are limited in its' use. ( no stars taken off for this )It does get clothing, bedding, dish cloths and towels quite clean; as clean as most harsher products available.So far we haven't seen any fabric 'wearing' or changes that usually happen with every wash.With the convenient tip and 1 squeeze per load it would be easy to get the 66 loads it says it can handle.Our problem with this is that we often do small loads and squeezing the bottle to expel a lesser amount is pretty awkward and can get messy.We've had to squeeze the full 1-squeeze-amount into a container and portion it out that way.Although it is a minimal inconvenience, it takes away a bit from the original purpose of just 1 squeeze per load.It does however give us a few more loads from the bottle so it balances out in the long run.For us, it weren't for the scent this would be close to perfect.First glance probably makes you think that the high price is too much but even at just 66 loads it works out to less than 50 cents per load.Doing smaller loads will obviously coast less per load.Seventh Generation products are fast becoming a staple in our household.They seem to be cornering the market for continually providing high quality, nature based products with reasonable pricing and a much lesser negative impact on the earth.",

                "reviewText": "I am loving all of Seventh Generation\u2019s laundry detergents that I\u2019ve tried, but so far the ULTRA Concentrated Lavender is the winner in our household! The scent of this formula is just divine, and you can tell it is from an essential oil rather than an artificial fragrance oil.I was a bit surprised at the small size of the bottle when I received it, especially for the hefty price tag, but it says it does 66 loads - I guess it really must be ultra concentrated! It does a good job at cleaning my laundry, bedding, etc., and leaves them smelling lovely and just lightly scented. Another really cool feature is the Auto Dosing Technology: you simply tilt the bottle and give a good squeeze, and it stops releasing the detergent after the required amount has come out.Overall this is yet another Seventh Generation product that does exactly as promised, utilizes clean and plant-based ingredients, and delivers a result that is even better than expected. I am so happy with this company, and will continue to be a loyal customer.",

                "reviewText": "The detergent cleans well and has a strong lavender scent that is noticeable right out of the washing machine. I don\u2019t notice it once the items go through the dryer. The dosing system is really easy to use and I\u2019d say it filled the detergent cup on my HE washer about 1/3-1/2 full of the \u2018normal\u2019 line - which is already not that much soap. So it is an improvement. I got one bottle for trial, but the page states this is a 2 pack, which would put the per bottle price in line with the regular 7th Gen 100 oz 66 load detergents. So you spend the same amount, get the same cleaning power and generate less waste. I think that\u2019s a pretty good reason to at least try this detergent out. So far I am liking it and would likely buy more.",
