We love the lavender scent. It is not too strong and very pleasant. The scent stays on clothes much longer than expected. The sheets are very easy to use, economical, and travel-friendly. We can just bring a few sheets with us on vacations without buying a bottle of detergent. No issues at all and really happy for this product!",

                "reviewText": "I'll admit that I am more of a \"traditional\" laundry person, meaning that I am used to either using a big jug of detergent or detergent pods, so when I first saw these I wasn't quite sure what to think.The first thing I noticed is that they have a pleasant, but not overpowering lavender scent. The front of the box says it's good for 80 loads, but that will depend on the size of load that you have. If you have larger laundry loads, then you will get about 40 loads as there are 40 sheets in the box, and a half sheet is recommended for small to medium loads, and a whole sheet is recommended for medium to large loads. I really like the fact that these are so portable, unlike my big old detergent bottle. These are also advertised as eco-friendly, which I am no expert on but they do seem more eco-friendly than most traditional detergent.I was skeptical when I first used these, but I was rather impressed when my clothes seemed about as clean and soft as they would be after washing with more traditional detergent - I won't name any names, but I typically use a more common household name brand. The detergent sheets were also completely dissolved at the end of the washing cycle, which I thought was pretty neat. The only thing that I miss from my old traditional detergent is after the wash there was a slightly fresh smell, but it was much more neutral than my more traditional detergent. Since I really like the smell of my more traditional detergent after the wash and this just doesn't match that, I'm docking a star.However, I was overall satisfied with everything else about these laundry detergent sheets. Not only are they easy to carry around and (likely) more environmentally friendly, but they are more cost effective than buying the unnamed name brand detergent that I often buy. I could also see someone who has allergies or is more sensitive to stronger detergents really liking these. Overall, I would recommend these to most people who don't have an attachment to the smell of more common name brand detergents.",

                "reviewText": "These Lana Lux eco laundry sheets were my first experience with this type of product. I usually use liquid detergent and have used powder and pods in the past. I came into this product with no expectations. Just a willingness to put my clothes and time on the line to try something new.The sheets came in a thin cardboard box that opens and closes from the side. Makes storing the sheet easy. Each sheet is perforated. Directions for sheets per load size is on the box. I have been following these directions exactly as stated. One for a large load of laundry. Half of one for any less.They have been super easy to just toss in with the clothes. No need to think or measure anything. No spills or accidentally adding too much. So compared to liquid or powder, they win there.After wash, my clothes are fresh and clean. There is a subtle smell of lavender. I haven't seen any stains left (but I also pre-treat if I know a spill will be bad). I have been pleasantly surprised. The sheets are comparable to my usual liquid detergent. I am happy to use these over the liquid.",

                "reviewText": "These laundry detergent sheets caught my attention because they're very compact and would probably travel well. So far, I'm pretty impressed with them.Pros:1) As far as I can tell, they're getting the laundry clean. I don't have a lot to go on, but the clothes smell clean, and no one in my household is complaining about their clothes.2) They smell good without being overpowering.3) They're very compact.4) There is no plastic waste.5) They dissolve completely in my front-loading washer.Cons: This is only enough detergent for eighty SMALL loads, not large loads. To be fair, though, when I decided to try to compare this detergent with my normal detergent, I realized that my normal detergent also advertises like this. It's hard for me to do a true cost comparison because my normal detergent is a liquid.Other: I have been following the directions and using a full sheet for large loads and a small sheet for small loads, and that seems to be adequate. I decided to refrain from telling other members of the household that I was using the detergent, and no one has complained about funny odors or itching skin, so I think it's working as advertised.Bottom line: Next time I go on a trip, this is the detergent I will take. Highly recommend!",
