Our strips are free of harmful chemicals and will keep your home safe and clean. The unscented version is perfect for people with sensitive skin. How do I use laundry strips? Easy!

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: these really are a well executed and cool idea, but i don\u2019t use them anymore. I gave Charlie\u2019s laundry soap and never turned back- powder detergents are where it\u2019s at for people that:1) have their own washing machine2) have a space to keep detergentBut if you have a communal laundry situation, are a college student, or want to be on the safe side while traveling - THESE.I do big loads so I used an entire sheet, torn into quarters and thrown on the bottom of the washer. When I opened the dryer I was delighted to find that my clothes smelled like clean clothes! And my clothes are genuinely disgusting when they go into the washer, from sweat, blood, animal hair and poop, engine oil, grease, and who knows what else - so this was no small task I was asking of these sheets. theyre so much easier than pods. I\u2019m trying to get my mom to switch now! plus anyone else that will listen!",

We have laundry in a very small closet in our bedroom and only a few inches of space to store detergent etc. so I had to find an alternative to regular detergent. I also hate how wasteful regular detergent containers are.A few pros:- I have very sensitive skin and haven't had any issues- I do not notice any scent with the unscented (very important to me)- My husband works in construction and his clothes are FILTHY! His clothes come out spotless with these sheets.I have a compact washing machine, that fits more than many other compact washers. I fill it as full as I can (equivalent to a medium load in a full size washer) and use 1/2 a sheet (1 load size) works great. I have also used this with hot, warm and cold washes without an issue.Highly recommend",

This product performs like a champ! Being very allergic to fragrances, and because most of the public laundromats' washing machines add their own highly scented detergent (unlike the ones in Asia) - these strips really saved me. Convenient to pack (very flat), the cardboard package takes up almost no space. Cleans clothes well enough. Unscented. Will be buying more for my next trip. Highly recommend.",
