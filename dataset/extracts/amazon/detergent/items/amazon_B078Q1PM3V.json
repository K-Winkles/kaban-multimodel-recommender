I started using them for my hedgehog\u2019s towels and blankets because fabric softener makes the blankets and towels repel water. While this is great for many situations, the purpose of the towels and blankets are to absorb any wetness or urine, which eliminates the need for shredded bedding. This stuff was perfect! I sincerely hope they don\u2019t discontinue this product because I like it FAR better than the waxy beads that other companies are making because those don\u2019t dissolve completely whereas the crystals always do.",

In now way am I paying $15 for 1 bottle. Very frustrating and waste of my time. Going out of my way to try to return it. Can't even bring it to target to return. Now I have to go to the store to buy it as I needed it now. I would give 0 stars.",
