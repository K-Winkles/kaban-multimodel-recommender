Actually, they were packaged very well.I started using these when I found them on a deal on the store and it's more convenient to have them on subscribe and save through Amazon. I can use one pod and be good with a typical load but it does give instructions on how much to use for what type of load.I stopped using powder or liquid detergent because it was hard on my shoulder (previous injury) and the pods just make is so much easier to do laundry without the mess or hassle of powder or liquid containers.Anyway, these are a good deal for the price and can be conveniently purchased on a repeat order on Subscribe & Save (occasionally they have been out but different scents are available to replace).",
