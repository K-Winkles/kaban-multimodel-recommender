Instead of spending $20 on laundry soap every 2 to 3 weeks (we do a lot of laundry), I buy one of these buckets and it lasts right around 9 months. I use around a quarter cup a load give or take, depending on what I'm washing. I like the way it cleans and that it doesn't have much of a scent. And we haven't had any issues with skin problems or irritations. I am careful about breathing it in when moving between buckets and containers. Also who doesn't love having a three gallon bucket to use when you finish with the soap. It's the perfect size. Only warning, it is heavy, I would not want to be responsible for hauling it up multiple flights of stairs.",

                "reviewText": "Great cleaning soap at a definite budget price. Tide works no better but I do wish it had a good fresh scent like tide and other soaps that do not work as good as this soap for sure. Tide and this soap are definitely equal as I'm in badly stained clothing from vehicles, welding daily and WOW is my one word review for a great five star value that I'd buy anyway over tide unless same price and tide would only win for it's scent then. But to save so much and considered to other cheap soaps even this soap is surely great as it cleans heavily soiled clothes like the best money can buy for sure, and I've try'd all the stain and spot removers before and this with a brush and some scrubbing works great and I think the powder form is actually a better cleaner for such things being somewhat abrasive and working itself between the clothing and substance staining them, think of it as comet vs soft liquid scubber. Hands down comment wins every time. Great product that I will be buying from now on at the best of prices for twice the soap of all but one I mentioned already... What a bargain... Says commercial grade and I thought just a selling ploy or gimmick word, but after around 20 loads so far I'm a believer of that term commercial quality now for sure and finally a soap that is what it claims to be unlikeless budget brands like All, Snuggle, Arm & Hammer, and many others I've tried over the years... If your value for dollar shopping you won't be at this soap at any price for sure... Love it... Thanks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

I decided to do a test load first to have point of reference.This product does not suds up, but it cleans just fine.I have now run dozens of loads of every kind and can attest to it's quality.No suds, no added wonderful fresh lilac aroma, but it cleans as well as others.",

                "reviewText": "I usually get detergent in 40lb pails, The normal brand i buy changed to a smaller 36 lb pail.I use the pails when detergent is gone and the 36 lb pail is not usable for my application.So GI Joe gets my purchases due to pail size and lid construction.Some people (Such as me) use the pails for other applications after detergent is gone.Also the GI Joe detergent works well and cleans very dirty work clothing with no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Just lightly scented and works really well. I wanted to switch to powder because I was told it's better for front loading machines and that 1-2 tbsps is enough. I put 1 tbsp in the soap dispenser area and it's doing a great job getting our clothes clean and fresh. And it's also going to last forever so it's a great deal. We do have softened water so less soap works well but if you have hard water you may need to use a little more but this bucket will still last a long long time!",

Joe laundry powder does the job and more. I no longer use bleach or spot treat stains. For stains just add a little extra powder to the load and it will do its thing. For ceramic floors add a little to the bucket and get the floors clean. I also use it on my granite counter top. Gets the counters clean with a great shine to boot. Love love this product and love the savings.",
