Earth Breeze Eco sheets will easily dissolve in hot or cold water. They are low sudsing, ultra-concentrated, hypoallergenic, and give a powerful, deep clean. Our Eco Formula works in all machines, HE included. This innovative formula works on the toughest stains, dislodges dirt molecules, and leaves your clothes smelling fresh. It is time for options that avoid the plastic jug. Over 91% of all plastic products are not recycled and end up in landfills, oceans or elsewhere. Let\u2019s un-jug together.

This has been so convenient that I'm now using it at home too because I don't have to get heavy bottles off the shelf and risk my back. It's light weight, works great, easy to use and eco-friendly. I highly recommend this product.",

I decided to try this because for some reason have trouble with my liquid detergent always leaking from the cap because I don\u2019t put it in right after using it (I know personal problems).Key points to note:\u2022 Stain Fighting Ability: I still use prewash stain remover sprays but out of the wash, the stains are gone.\u2022 Smell: eliminates all odor and clothes smell fresh after wash, not super strong scent, but I like that cause it doesn\u2019t interfere with my colognes.\u2022 Skin Irritant: I have sensitive skin and this has not affected my skin in any way! Now people do have sensitivities for different elements in the world, but for me it\u2019s been great!\u2022 Storage: saves so much space! And no messy liquids!\u2022 Waste: with only 9% of plastics being recycled, there\u2019s like no waste! Just a very small piece of cardboard.\u2022 Value: Definitely worth every penny!*Definitely recommend for efficient cleaning power and also mindfulness for the environment!",

It's HARD!!Pros: no plastic, lightweight for shipping, all packaging is recyclable, easy to dispense, GREAT for travel, nice scent.Cons: doesn't seem to work well in cooler water, may see \"chunks\" on clothes, picks off easily, scent is almost unnoticeable in finished laundry (I like clothes to \"smell\" clean\"). Kind of off to store, I just stack a pile up and grab one as I go.These seem to work best if you add the detergent sheet first, and clothes in on top. They do seem to clean well. I love the low to now waste and less yucky chemicals in my laundry.",

They were the best choice because she's on the 5th floor and the laundry facilities are in the basement. These sheets are so great because not only is the packaging minimal and light weight, it fits in the side pocket of her laundry bag.She loves the convenience of them, they smell good, easy to use and they keep her clothes clean. She loved them so much, that I decided to try them as well and I love them too. They free up so much space in my laundry room and I don't have to lift the heave bottles of laundry detergent which I'm grateful for because I have issues with my elbows.Also, and best of all they are better for our environment! I just love that! Try them, I'm sure you will love them!",

In addition, it does not take up much space in the laundry room and contributes to the ecology of our planet. I'm glad the makers of Earth Breeze came up with the idea of making this product. The only downside is that it has no fragrance.",

At times when we have a big load or yard clothing we\u2019ve used two sheets and have been very satisfied with the results. We love not having the plastic jugs. Every little bit helps our environment. Great job to the company.",

                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews, I expected when I used a sheet that it would leave a scent of some kind, but I was impressed that it left no scent. Our clothes came out clean and smelling fresh. I followed the directions and only used 1/4, 1/2 or a whole sheet depending on how big my load was in the washer. I have a front loading machine, so I place my sheet in the dispenser. After washing, there is residue left in the dispenser but I quickly rinsed it out. Very convenient to use.",

                "reviewText": "I love the concept of laundry sheets. No more bulky detergent containers in my small house. No need to ship heavy containers all over the country. No empty plastic jugs to send to the landfill. Easy to tear to whatever size is needed so there's no waste like there is with pods.Cleaning performance is slightly less than a good liquid detergent, but the other benefits make the trade off worth it to me. If I pre-treat spots or pre-soak heavily soiled items it does fine. I use the unscented version.Bonus: great for travel! So convenient in our RV or even in a hotel room sink.",
