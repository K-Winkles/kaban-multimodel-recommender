I've tried several generic store brands as well as Tide's sensitive version, and Dreft and Purex. I fell like Purex and this Arm& Hammer sensitive skin detergent are the most effective cleaners, and this is definitely better than Purex for just any load of laundry.We have a new baby, so we've been washing everything in sensitive skin detergents just in case he has any reaction to his own clothes or to being held on our clothes. I absolutely love this detergent, it gently cleans dirty baby clothes AND stained or sweaty adult clothes, towels too. (Although, just a note: I HATE the 4x concentrated version of Arm & Hammer sensitive skin detergent...impossible to find the right amount to use without meticulously measuring every time, cause too much leaves soap residue, and too little doesn't clean! But this version is easy to use, without having to measure so carefully.)",

I haven't had any issues with my clothes looking & smelling clean. I just wish the manufacturer would keep it supplied in powder form for selling. Seriously, the amount of $ & fuel wasted shipping me a liquid that's probably 90% water, plus it needing to be in a plastic jug at a time when the US can't even handle recycling its own plastic use, makes it very unreasonable for it to be sold only in liquid form. I used to be able to find the powder in local stores. But for a couple years now I can't find it in any store or online.",
