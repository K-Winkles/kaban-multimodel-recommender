It's gentle on the skin, odorless, and easy to dispense. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate its gentle formula, which doesn't cause any irritation from the clean clothes. Plus, it's odorless, leaving clothes smelling of nothing, which is needed because my wife is exceptionally sensitive to perfumy laundry detergent. The squeezable pour cap makes dispensing the detergent super easy, saving time and limiting over-pour, making sure we use the exact same amount each time. Overall, I highly recommend Whirlpool Liquid Laundry Detergent.",

The dispenser works well and I never have to guess how much to use. It simply squirts out- not leaks or mess. I much prefer Swash to the larger bottles that are heavy and difficult to store. My laundry room is very small and it fits neatly below the washer. I highly recommend Swash!",

                "reviewText": "Swash is a very good concentrated laundry detergent and I really like the Simply Sunrise scent; I like it so much that I've reordered it several times. Sometimes the auto-measure dispenser doesn't work proper a little into using the bottle and I have to remove the cap and guestimate to dispense. I usually do larger loads and it requires several squirts for that, but it works great, smells great and leaves the clothes having a nice texture. I have not used it to clean major stains so I can't give any info about that.",

                "reviewText": "Swash comes in a smaller bottle and it seems to get our clothes clean and the Linen scent is alright. The problem and the reason I bought the product, was its claim to have the best delivery system. It does not have a good delivery system or maybe I have been saddled with a top that doesn\u2019t work. The video is deceiving, making it look so easy to use. Once I think I have the cap filled by holding the bottle upright and squeezing the sides creating an intake of air into the cap, I overturn the bottle only to confronted by a few dribbles. It just plain doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not sure what to do about this since the product was touted as easy to dispense. They should have said \u2018unless your cap doesn\u2019t work\u2019. Not only doesn\u2019t it work, it\u2019s a major fail. There is no where on the package that suggests how much to dispense without utilizing their cap; a step I would hate, considering that amount would be small and half of the product would adhere to the measuring utensil. I have a front loader with no way to swish the swash off of the alternative to the cap. If they could send me a bunch of caps, I could possibly find one that works. This is a good product, I just can\u2019t figure out how to use it to clean my laundry.",

                "reviewText": "We just got a new front load machine. Was used to using pods but they don't always dissolve entirely and liquids getting funky and gunky in the dispenser drawer can be problematic - I wanted to give this a shot to solve both.It arrived intact with no leaks or damage, which is always a relief. Really love the small size. One could stash anywhere or take to the laundromat easily on a pinch.Scent is really not \"citrus\" in my opinion, but light and fresh upon dispensing, more on this later. The lid worked fine and the tiny amount rinsed fully into the wash without leaving a trace in the drawer. I will update if this changes in any manner - with any solution I identify.Hand Measuring - For those with a \"broken\", defective or otherwise non-working lid - dividing the 30oz by 83 = 0.361445783 oz. per squirt/load - since 1Tablespoon = 0.5 oz. With 2 teaspoons = 0.333334 oz.- add just a tad over that per load :-)The load was scented (still not citrus imo) following wash and clothes were clean despite a couple old stains that I did pretreat with dabs from my dispensed detergent. VERY happy about that.After drying, the scent remains. I will add that some scents bother me, this one included. I am not allergic but something in this, Oxi Max Force gel as well as other detergents & hand soaps take my breath away. I avoid the laundry aisle due to this issue. Not a strong scent but a quality I prefer to avoid and would not want on sheets or other things particularly near my face. Perhaps an extra rinse would remedy this ??Overall, I like this product. May try unscented in the future for obvious reasons. I have used Amazon Basics Fresh Scent pods for quite a while with great results and no problem with scent at all but they do not always dissolve completely - so also trying that brand of liquid now with high hopes.",

                "reviewText": "When my old washer broke down, I bought a Maytag and this detergent was the recommended product. I don't know where to buy it other than from Amazon. The no-scent version really has no smell at all. The linen version has a very light, pleasant smell. The small bottle is so convenient to handle and to store. It's not hard to get a single or double squeeze of fluid from the bottle but beware - this product does not work for my friend with severe arthritis in her hands. For most people, it's fine and it lasts a very long time and we do a lot of laundry. I recommend it.",
