                "reviewText": "Laundry detergent is a constant \"must have\" and since I have no intention of going back to making my own soap, purchasing is a \"have to\", often. As the current standard form for washers is liquid, buying in stores, and lugging it home has become an onerous task, so I am absolutely delighted to be able to get it on subscription so that it always arrives and I never run out. We like whisk because it both gets the clothes clean, using a modest amount, and leaves less goopy scent left on the clothes - you know that scent goo attracts dirt and other odors, right? I will be happy when the figure out how to make a concentrate that can be mixed with regular water somehow - thereby reducing the volume that has to be lugged or shipped, but I do understand that water quality variability makes that difficult for manufacturers, so, for now, this works. Very happy with both the detergent's sunctioning and the subscription service!",

It works well: the cleaning results & high efficiency (you will need to use less of it) is worth the two or three dollars more in price than most of its competition.

It effectively cleans clothes while being gentle on the skin, causing no irritations or allergic reactions. The scent-free formula is a bonus for those who prefer a more neutral fragrance. The cleaning power is impressive, tackling stains and leaving clothes fresh and clean. The easy-to-use packaging and the fact that it\u2019s suitable for high-efficiency machines make it a practical choice. Tide Free & Gentle has earned its spot as my go-to laundry detergent.",
