I used Forever New for washing my Lingerie, my Towels, my Clothes, my Carpet and anything else that needs cleaning. It's gentle, yet effective. I think my clothes, towels, and carpet have had their life extended by using this product. I can also use cold water saving the heating bills for water. On top of that, it has a faint scent like clean, fresh air after a winter rain! It's just enough to say, \"Ahhhhhhhh,\" when you smell your clothes. It's not so strong it knocks you out like some detergents do. Thank you Forever New for your wonderful product. I can't say enough good things about it. All I can say to everyone is try it. You will LOVE it! DeeDee G. An extremely satisfied customer!",

It keeps the color fresh and helps my delicates last longer. I stopped using it for awhile due to price and I can sure tell the difference between items washed with regular laundry detergent and this. The scent is enchanting to me. Sometimes I use a little extra just so my clothes smell stronger.",

                "reviewText": "I am new to Forever New. My review is for the unscented liquid. I have started to feel now that my clothes have probably been washed 2-3 times in this laundry liquid (I finished a 2-pack) that they are noticeably softer with no other product used in the wash or dry cycle. I think that this soap goes a long way, because you do not need more than a few tablespoons in an HE washer. I notice a very slight \"clean\" scent from the clothes, which I like and doesn't seem to bother my very sensitive nose. I recommend this detergent because it is eco-friendly, and blankets, sweaters, cotton shirts etc all feel really nice and soft, and look and smell clean. It might cost more than the typical everyday detergent, but I will be reordering.My one particularly important note for those with hardwood floors, this *might* take the finish off if not cleaned up. I rent and the floor was already bad, but I did notice a few spots that looked new and like drip marks in front of the washer. Because the soap is clear it is hard to notice if you accidentally have a drop or two hit the floor, and now I just make sure I wipe up every time.",
