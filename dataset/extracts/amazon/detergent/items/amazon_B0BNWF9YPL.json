I\u2019ll use it in a pinch, but I suffer from migraines and the smell of this is just too strong for me. The tide with oxi pods don\u2019t seem to have the same scent.

                "reviewText": "Perfect. Tide is what we use. This Tide ultra does do a better job on the whites, so we upgraded to this. When something works as good as you want it to, it makes no sense to change. We have only recently started the subscription through amazon because of this price. It is so much more convenient than lugging these big jugs to and from the car as we used to when buying at Giant. The product is very good. The price is as good if not better than our local sales and most of all I never have to worry about running out. Amazon is becoming our one stop shopping spot. Regarding the product, I have tried a few others and always some little thing I did not like so back to tide and using tide ultra I no longer have a need for pre-treating.",
