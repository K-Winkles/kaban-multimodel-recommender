Since athletic wear has gotten so pricey lately, I try and hand wash/line dry my Lululemon, Athleta, Adidas & yoga wear. I used this product for years on my fine washable sweaters but it was hard to find and somewhat pricey. Now since I can buy on Amazon and have it delivered I can watch the prices a bit easier and ai always grab a few larger bottles (the detergent and fabric softener are my favorite in any brand hands down, but their entire product like is very nice). The scents are pure and concentrated but nit in a string perfume-y or in an artificial way but you can fill the room with the lovely scents while washing and it leaves a mild scent on the washed items as well but not so much that you would smell it wearing it. Sweet pea is my favorite but all of the scents are so nice and you don\u2019t have to stay with one. They mix just fine.But the product itself is very high quality. A little but cleans quite a bit and will last me a long time. And I can ever wash cashmere and wool and hang dry so they look as good as new.For both scent and cleaning this product is the best on the market for hand washables (or regular laundry is you so indulge). I signed they had more fragrances available lately and that\u2019s the only downside. I have a hard time finding them consistently.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the better high-end eco-friendly laundry detergents I've used. I have found it cleans well. Lavendar Pine is a very strong scent that will totally perfume your laundry area but isn't overwhelming once clothes are dried. A touch stronger than regular lavendar with the pine undertone. I just got the Ginger Pomelo and have to say I was a tad bit disappointed only because it doesn't really smell like ginger or pomelo at all, although I did notice a very pleasant smell in the laundry area afterwards. Sweet pea is a very pleasant, slightly sweet floral smell, and probably my favorite as it is subtle but noticeable. I have had the Blue Sage in their general cleaning formula and it is not for me. I'm not sure what it smells like, certainly not sage I am familiar with (sage is a love of mine), but it is very strong; however, my neighbor loved it and I gave it to her. So that will leave me one scent to try I suppose. None of these smells have left an overwhelming scent on my clothes once dried, but they all greatly perfume the laundry area. I feel it leaves my cottons and linens pretty soft also.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I wanted to have my clothes and bedding come out of he dryer with a scent as fresh as when the weather is nice and I can use my outdoor clothes line. The scent of this detergent soft and fresh. And while it doesn't quite smell like the sun, it does a great job leaving me with clean items. Stains come out in one washing. I would recommend this detergent with no reservations.",
