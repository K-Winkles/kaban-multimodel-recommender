                "reviewText": "First the small size is great. The smell is amazing and strong in the package. The smell reduces after washing which I prefer because it\u2019s not overpowering but still smells fresh and clean. I have a washer that doesn\u2019t fill all the way with water ,so unfortunately these left a film on one of my blankets and I had to rewash it. It also didn\u2019t work well for my towels so I again had to rewash. I think for everyday washing they will work well, but I\u2019ll have to keep looking for eco friendly products that work better for me.",

My clothes come out cleaner and.brighter not to mention it is so easy to use. I was a little nervous when it came because I couldn\u2019t figure out how these small sheets of product could work , boy was I surprised. Not only do they work well but they are so easy and there is no mess.",

                "reviewText": "Love that it is so environmentally friendly. There is no big plastic containers to rinse forever for recycling. You don\u2019t have to wonder if it\u2019s really getting recycled, or what kind of other environmental issues are being caused by the plastic recycling process. It is extremely easy to use with no messes, and it cleans as well as any other laundry soap/detergent I have used. The minimal amount of cardboard used for the size of the packaging is at least a renewable resource when handled properly. Have to start improvements the best you can somewhere :)",

This detergent works great - even took out a set butter stain that I didn't realize was on a cotton shirt until I put it in the washer. I use a half strip for most loads, full one for sheets/towels large loads. Does the trick, dissolves well, never had a problem that way. Wish the paper packaging was a little stiffer, and that it cost a little less, but I'm buying it again. Have used it 3-4 times a week for at least 6 weeks for consistent results. No stinky perfumes, barely detectable scent to my nose.",
