I don't think traditional detergents with added dyes and fragrance do anything helpful, and are known to cause issues in select populations, so why not skip the \"nasties\" and go for something more natural? I have noticed that I need to use LESS of this product than my old detergent and the amount it cleans is the same, if not better. ZERO complaints except that in my opinion, they say to use waaaaay more detergent than is actually needed, but this goes for all detergents. A+++",
