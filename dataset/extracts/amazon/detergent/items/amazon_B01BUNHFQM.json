My clothes come out of the wash clean with a subtle scent every single time, and I'm even more convinced that my clothes are clean because the stains that was on the fabric is normally gone.The pods make measuring obsolete. I don't have to measure out the liquid or worry about spilling it. I toss in one pod for my clothes and two for towels. No cleanup, no worries that I've put in too much or too little. The pods are one of the best inventions out there, at least to me.Tide Pods is all I use.",

But I just use a cloth to clean hands and throw in washer too. It's too bad that almost every order I've received has had some busted pods. I wish they'd come intact for once.

                "reviewText": "One of the things I love about Tide Pods is their convenience. Because they are pre-measured, I don't have to worry about measuring out detergent or adding in additional stain removers or brighteners. This saves me time and hassle, which is always a plus.Tide Pods are also incredibly effective at cleaning clothes. They do a great job of removing dirt, grime, and stains, even on heavily soiled clothing. I've been particularly impressed with their ability to remove tough stains, such as coffee and wine. And because the pods contain a brightener, my clothes always come out looking clean and vibrant.Another thing I appreciate about Tide Pods is their versatility. They can be used in both regular and high-efficiency washing machines, which means I don't have to worry about purchasing a separate detergent for each machine. And because they are so effective, I don't need to use as much detergent as I would with other brands, which saves me money in the long run.Overall, I highly recommend Tide Pods to anyone looking for a convenient and effective way to do laundry. They are easy to use, versatile, and deliver great results. Whether you have a large family or just need to do a few loads of laundry each week, Tide Pods are a great choice.",

The compact size makes them perfect for travel, and I love that I don't have to worry about carrying around a bulky stain remover.Overall, I would highly recommend Tide to-go pens to anyone in need of a convenient and effective solution for on-the-go stains.
