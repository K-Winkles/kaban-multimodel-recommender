Super luxe linens washed with Diva, and finished off with capri blue volcano dryer balls. The combination is heavenly and the scent lasts for days. Yes it's expensive, but this is a treat for linens, towels and sweaters. Regular laundry gets regular detergent. I wish I WAS a millionaire so I could wash everything with Diva, but for now.. it's my little treat to pamper me and the hubby. The little things matter.",
