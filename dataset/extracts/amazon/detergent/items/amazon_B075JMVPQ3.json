                "reviewText": "I used to be a die-hard Tide fan. I grew up washing my clothes with Tide. Their big, orange jug is practically synonymous with my definition of \"laundry.\" However, now there is a better alternative than all that plastic and waste. I honestly don't know why the major laundry detergent brands haven't caught on to the fact that most of us are climate conscious and are looking to be more environmentally responsible with our consumption.Despite that, I'm not willing to sacrifice quality. I want a product that is going to be effective, cost-efficient, AND better for the environment. I tried a number of different brands of laundry sheets before settling on Breezeo laundry strips. I like that the sheets are perforated, so you can easily choose how much you need per load. My husband is in construction, so his clothes are much dirtier than mine and typically need two strips. However, for everyday wear, one strip (or 1/3 of a sheet) is more than sufficient!The sheets themselves dissolve easily, whether you're washing in hot or cold water and this \"Fresh Linen\" scent is both clean and pleasant.Why lug a big, plastic tub of laundry detergent around when you can use these laundry strips? They're lighter, pack flatter, take up less space in your laundry room, are better for the environment, smell great, and clean your clothes just as well (if not better.)Loving laundry may still be a stretch, but I like doing it with these laundry strips a whole lot better than I used to!",

                "reviewText": "These are great, clothes get clean, easy no mess or spill. Packaging is small, environment friendly and takes up less space in the laundry room. Great for traveling. The only issue I had was my fault, always add the sheet first, not on top of the clothes or you may get white marks which easily brush off.",

These dissolve well has left no residue on clothes and leaves them clean and smelling fresh! The only thing I wish is that they would make bigger packages of them. We have lots of laundry and have to order often.",

                "reviewText": "This review is written after having used the entire package. They were easy to use, dissolved well, and were convenient... but, I was always questioning if my clothes were clean. In fact, on some occasions, I had to re-launder my loads because the clothes still had typical body odors, and other indicators of not being clean. It got better when I started added 1 strip more than recommended. At that point, there were no odors, but the clothes smelled like absolutely nothing. So, I'd individually sniff each item before putting in the dryer. It caused me a lot of stress wondering if clothes were truly clean, so I ended up going back to Tide. Would love this method of strip detergent if it had a better formula that was more powerful at cleaning. My clothes are not especially dirty - just work from home.",

                "reviewText": "I love this detergent. I have introduced it to my family and friends as well. I love that it replaces the heavy liquid containers and all the plastic waste. It has a pleasant smell to start but is very gently without dyes, as my family has sensitive skin and I avoid perfumes and dyes. It cleans the laundry well. It doesn't get every stain out so I do have to use other sprays of there is a major spill or oil stains, but I don't expect it to get rid of everything. I feel my clothes are clean and don't have any smell. The simplicity of the sheets make it easier for me to teach my kids to do the laundry and with a busy family of 7 with lots of sports uniforms. I have been so happy to find this product.",

                "reviewText": "I always feel guilty for buying detergent in those chunky plastic, one-time-use bottles - heavier to ship too, and to carry up and down floors. So I found Breezeo, read the reviews and took a chance. Happy I did... because I'll be buying this again :)PROS- Decent clean. Haven't tried it on anything too filthy, I admit, but on average fabrics with average smells and stains? Breezeo does the trick.- The cardboard envelope that the strips come in is small, light, and recyclable. No more bulky plastic bottles for me!- Great scent. You can't really smell it on your finished clothes, though, which I also like. But it's a fresh whiff of clean sweetness whenever you open the envelope flap.CONS- No suds. I mean, these detergent strips dissolve in the water and they do clean my loads, but the soap doesn't make visible suds, and I kinda just wish it would for peace of mind lol.",
