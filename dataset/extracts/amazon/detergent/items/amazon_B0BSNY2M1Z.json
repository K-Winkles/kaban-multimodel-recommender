                "reviewText": "I've tried this laundry detergent too, and combining my experience with customer reviews, here's a balanced perspective:Pros:- Pleasant Scent: Many customers, including myself, love the fragrance. It's described as great, fresh, and subtle.- Effective Cleaning: It effectively removes stains and gets clothes clean, even in cold water and for heavily soiled items.- Value for Money: The product is considered a good value, offering quality cleaning at a reasonable price.- Environmentally Friendly: Works well in greywater systems, making it a suitable choice for eco--conscious households.- Versatility: Effective for a range of laundry items, from delicates to heavy throw rugs. - Odor Removal: It's particularly good at removing unwanted odors from clothes.Cons:- Leakage During Shipping: Some customers, including myself, have experienced issues with the product leaking during delivery.- Fragrance Sensitivity: While the scent is generally well-liked, it may be too strong for those sensitive to fragrances.- Availability: The desired scent can be hard to find in some locations, leading customers to order online despite concerns over potential spillage.Summary:This laundry detergent is a great choice for those seeking effective cleaning with a pleasant scent. Its ability to work in cold water and greywater systems is a plus for both energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. While the fragrance is generally appreciated, it might be overpowering for some. The major drawback seems to be the risk of leakage during shipping, a concern for online purchasers. However, overall, it offers good value for money and reliable cleaning performance, making it a solid choice for routine laundry needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best laundry detergent that I have used thus far!! I have gone through several different brands. It\u2019s gets the clothes very clean, and the smell is amazing. With last detergents, I always found myself using a lot of detergent bc the clothes would still be coming out with stains and odor. Then I started issuing multiple things in my laundry just to make it smell better. The scent booster beads, fabrics softener, etc. With Arm&Hammer I don\u2019t have to use any of that. Just the detergent and a small amount of at that and the clothes come out exceptionally clean every time. My machine is already 7 years its good for the machine",
