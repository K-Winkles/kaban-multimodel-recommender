        "description": "Sometimes you've got to pull out the big guns. Seventh Generation Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent Packs feature an advanced stain fighting formula with 20% more cleaning power. Fight your toughest stains like coffee, tomato sauce, grass, and ice cream - all without the use of synthetic fragrances, dyes, or artificial brighteners. This laundry soap uses plant-derived enzyme stain removers like Pro tease and Amylase to tackle the mess, while whitening and anti-graying enzymes help brighten. We like to keep it real when it comes to scents, too. Our Fresh Citrus Laundry Detergent is scented with 100% essential oils and botanical ingredients like orange peel, grapefruit peel, and lavender. Our new tub packaging is fully recyclable and designed with storage and freshness in mind - the shape fits neatly in tight spaces, and the flip top closure keeps packs fresh and unreachable from your little ones. These easy-to-use laundry packs are wrapped in a dissolvable PVA film - just toss one into your high-efficiency (HE) or standard washing machine and let our plant-based ingredients work their wonder. For more than 25 years, Seventh Generation has been thoughtfully formulating safe and effective plant-based products that work. Really well. As a leading green washing detergent manufacturer, we are proud to offer the first powdered laundry packs that are EPA Safer Choice Certified. You may also notice a cute Leaping Bunny seal on our products. That means we never test our products on animals and our products do not contain animal-based ingredients. We design our products to be safe for people, their homes, and the environment. Based in Vermont, Seventh Generation is proud to be a Certified B Corporation. By choosing Seventh Generation products, you're joining us in nurturing the health of the next seven generations. Compared to the amount of cleaning enzymes in our laundry detergent packs.",

                "reviewText": "I am super scent sensitive so I cannot use liquid laundry detergents with fragrance because the smell lingers in the dispenser and I get a headache. These are great because the scent is very mild, I ziploc the bag very tightly so as it does not make the hallway smell like citrus. It sits right around the corner from the bedroom so any smells literally keep me up at night. I noticed in the reviews many people felt it did not get clothes clean or the smell was too faint. I had a very smelly laundry basket of bath towels and wet rags etc that sit in the great summer heat and begin to reek. Put 2 pods in the washer with a large load today and added some baking soda for softening and wow. They came out of the washer smelling clean with a hint of citrus which was great. I am excited to see how they smell etc tonight when I take out of the dryer to fold and put away. So far so good this will remain on my list for washing bath towels. May even let my man use a single pod for his clothes since he likes fragrances. lol.",

                "reviewText": "My husband does the laundry. Before you praise him he only does it because he wears a uniform for work and he refuses to buy more pants ,socks, underwear etc. Therefore he has to wash clothes more often. Plus our home is off grid and we use grey water for the animals this product works great.",
