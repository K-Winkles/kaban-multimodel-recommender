                "reviewText": "I am delighted to provide a review of the Puracy Natural Dish Soap Refill. Having used it for a while, I can attest that this is a fantastic dishwashing detergent that is both effective and eco-friendly.Firstly, the 48-ounce size refill is an excellent value for money, and it lasts a long time, making it an economical choice for people who are trying to reduce their household expenses. The packaging is also very convenient, with a screw-top lid that makes it easy to pour the liquid into smaller bottles.The scent of organic lemongrass is refreshing and not overpowering, making it a joy to use. The formula is plant-based and free of harsh chemicals such as sulfates, parabens, and phosphates, making it gentle on the skin and the environment.The soap lathers well and effectively cleans even the toughest grease and grime on dishes, leaving them sparkling clean. It also has a clean-rinsing water-sheeting formula that ensures no residue is left on dishes, so there's no need for a second rinse.Overall, I highly recommend the Puracy Natural Dish Soap Refill, and I believe it is a great product that is both effective and environmentally friendly. It is also affordable and comes in a convenient size that makes it easy to use and store.",
