It\u2019s a cute little bottle.I HATE the packaging through. It is just an open lid, so when you unscrew it or screw it back on, the leftover soap drips out from the seal. It\u2019s super messy. I\u2019d expect the packaging to be much better.",

                "reviewText": "I see a lot of bad reviews stating hatred of the new cap. I don\u2019t have that issue , I save a cap from a dead bottle, and use it for future loads. I like to use Method\u2019s caps because I feel as though the caps 1st gen have are too large for my loads. My mother would use a plastic measuring cup when I was growing up. Either way I actually like the new spout, it pours better and with less spillage in my opinion. I have more control with this bottle, but I have a hand that\u2019s double jointed and I get frustrated with the other bottles shapes. This must mean this bottle is very annoying to people with normal bend-one-way fingers. I agree that the bottle should be changed so spillage hole will catch excess liquid, that is common sense.I love the scent so much, the non-concentrated kind had a lavender I am not into, very wild flower type. The concentrated kind smells like Bulgarian type of lavender that is amazing. I am thinking to try the one pour spout, it seems like more bang for your buck and claims to be the same scent. I use like 6 different soaps combined in my wash, but this is the main soap I use for scent and power. I also have to hand wash most of my clothes, so that makes a difference in type of soap I choose as well.Gets every stain out (along with my other choices) my girl works at a mechanic shop and this soap is completely necessary in my get-it-clean system. We also have two completely different scent needs for our bodies, I am woodsy she is sweet, and as women this is a great base scent for every kind of cologne, perfume, essential oil , lotion, or hair stuff we use. Enjoy!",

Now that I'm married, I wanted to figure out what brand would work for us throughout our own home. I wanted a detergent that smelt good, cleaned the laundry ( of course ), didn't cause skin irritation, less chemicals, etc.My husband works almost 12 hour days as a landscaper and he works out in the sun. He comes home dirty, covered with grass, and soaked with sweat. The only bone that I have to pick with this detergent is that it doesn't get the smell out of his clothes and sometimes they don't look the cleanest it could. So I switched detergents.This is probably just my experience. If your husband doesn't work outside, I recommend this detergent.",

I have tried so many other ones and they all had one thing wrong with them, scent, a film, toughness, etc. This one has been perfect, no weird detergent film, nice and soft after wash and zero scent but our clothes are so clean and smell fresh and natural like cotton. It's also not to bad with stains and has kept our clothes in great condition while other competitors left our clothes with wash wear and discoloration. My only minor complaint is they changed their lid and I hate it, it leaks horribly. I ended up asking the company why they changed it and it was due to manufactures not producing it anymore because of the pandemic and rising costs. They also sent me a coupon to use for my troubles which they didn't have to. I ended up keeping my old bottle and just refill it so I don't have to worry about the cap leaking or getting sticky.I usually purchase this at my local grocery store but sometimes they sell out, it's nice that Amazon carries it.",
