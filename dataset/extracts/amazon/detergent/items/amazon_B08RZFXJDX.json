When I first used it it, I was dubious that the little strips would work but let me tell you they do! I didn't realize I was wasting a lot of detergent and using so much more than I have to now. I do not like any scent and as a single guy, wondered if this little strip would clean good enough not leave any smell without the use of fragrance to cover. It does, it works wonderfully. The ONLY MINOR downside is, it is not quite as good on certain stains, mostly food types, almost though. But these were quickly dispatched by a small spray of pre-treatment and from then on, no problems. The upsides far out weigh this one minor issue, the space saving, the ease of use, the elimination of the big plastic jugs. I am a happy convert!",

What more can I say?I'm still working out when to use one strip and when to use two. One strip seems to work even for big loads so long as the clothes aren't very dirty or greasy. I haven't taken the chance on a single strip for a really dirty load, but I suspect that would be fine as well.",
