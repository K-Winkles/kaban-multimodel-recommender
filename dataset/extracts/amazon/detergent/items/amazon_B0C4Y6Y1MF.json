I washed jeans that had been sweated through with two sheets. Everything came out clean. I didn't notice a smell, but they were fresh. It got out a few coffee stains as well. I have a few left but will hang on to them for similar travel situations, not wasting them in a regular washing machine. These little sheets allowed two people to take a 15-day trip with basically five days worth of clothes. I will buy these again when we run out!",

                "reviewText": "First off, this is a great idea! It saves space and doesn't leaf a large plastice bottle in the environment. It also makes doing laundry a bit easier and smoother overall. No need to measure liquid or even carry the extra weight around. The only problem is the scent is very, very faint. I used 2 sheet in a full load and could hardly smell anything. They suggest 1 sheet per load but really it's probably closer to 3. (If you want to smell the lavender scent) I actually don't prefer strong scented laundry detergent but if I'm going with \"lavender\" scented detergent I do want to smell some of it on my clothes.I thought I'd try this over liquid detergent since the price was a bit less. But given that more than 1 sheet was needed per load I'm not really saving much at all. But I really don't miss carrying liquid detergent around so I'll continue to try out the sheets but maybe a different brand next time.",
