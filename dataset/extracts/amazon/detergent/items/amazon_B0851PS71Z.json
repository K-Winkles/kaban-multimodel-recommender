I immediately ordered Diva and mixed it with 2 parts unscented Tide to 1 part Diva. I honestly loved the smell but didn\u2019t find it that strong. Because of the cost, I use it on bedding, blankets and towels only. The hubs comes home from work and immediately asks \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d For which I replied, laundry soap. He said it reminds him of his supervisor at work\u2026. \u201cOh God, now I have to come home to be reminded of work.\u201d I guess his boss uses Diva as well. It\u2019s way too pricey, but cleans well. Clothing is soft and smells fantastic. It\u2019s a super clean smell\u2026 the only way I can describe it. It\u2019ll repeat purchase as needed. It, along with the Tushy, I think are my favorite purchases from Amazon. Life changing!!!!!",

For us, this is not an everyday laundry detergent for everything. We use this only on our bedding and towels. The smell is amazing and lasts a very long time.I was concerned that, because the scent is so strong that this was full of chemicals, but according to the description this is \"BIODEGRADABLE & CHEMICAL FREE...this concentrated, fine laundry detergent cleans dirt, lifts stains, and softens fabrics without the use of any artificial fillers, dyes or phosphates...\"It is pricey, but definitely worth the spend to treat yourself to a bit of luxury.",

I love washing all of mine and my daughters clothes in it. Along with towels and blankets, just because I LOVE this scent so much. I have people stop and ask me what the scent is almost daily. Yet it\u2019s not so overpowering that it engulfed you. They walk by me closely or I\u2019m talking to them closely and they can smell it. You don\u2019t need very much, and how much you use obviously can determine the strength. I do add a Tide free and clear pod with this just because!",

                "reviewText": "I stopped a lady in a shop to ask her what perfume she was wearing. It was the best thing I have ever smelled on anyone. She told me it was her detergent. At first, I thought that couldn't be right. However, she said I could buy it at the store I was in so I went over there and opened the top to smell it. WOW!! I was shocked at how expensive it was so I bought a small one. I went home and washed my blankets with this detergent. I was in heaven!!! I don't know how to explain the smell other than to say it smells so clean and perfect. The smell fades after the first couple of days but it is still there. I now wash my blankets and pillow cover and my shirts in it. I have reordered many many times. I have had lots of people stop me to comment on my perfume and they are always shocked when I tell them it is my detergent. Buy it you deserve it!!!",

                "reviewText": "This wash is amazing! It lingers for weeks and longer in drawers and closets. Just my personal opinion, this product works best in newer model washers. The older models use way too much water, and you lose much of the fragrance due to this. I have both kind, and that was my experience. The wash is light and it only takes the recommended amount (in newer machines) This wash is a bit pricy for the amount you get. It's a nice little splurge gift for yourself, definitely worth it ~",
