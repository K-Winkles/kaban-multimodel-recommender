I had been using only Tide and Cheer for years, but after I switched to other brands that shall not be named, I noticed my clothes faded and wore out more quickly. I went back to Tide and haven't looked back. Now I search for sales on Tide, specifically the Power Pods, because they are like twice the size of regular pods, and I have a large capacity washer, so we wash a lot of clothes at once. These pods clean great while keeping your clothes in good condition. This particular scent is really nice as well. I'm a Tide girl and it's wonderful having these delivered straight to my door! I got this one during Prime Days, and when Tide power pods are on sale, I grab them up quick!",
