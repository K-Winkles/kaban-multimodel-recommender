You can literally feel the difference! We love this detergent so much, we ended up buying the softener too, in addition to other Mrs. Meyers products.",

                "reviewText": "My favorite laundry soap. Scented but not overpoweringly so - or so I thought until I opened the twin pack box and one of them had leaked about 1/4 of the product out and soaked through not one by two boxes. Rinsed off the bottles and the issue seems to be a loose cap, as they haven't leaked since. Yes, I COULD return them via Amazon, but it seems pretty wasteful. So I'll keep them, take the small financial hit for losing 1/4 of one bottle - but I won't order this product off Amazon again.",
