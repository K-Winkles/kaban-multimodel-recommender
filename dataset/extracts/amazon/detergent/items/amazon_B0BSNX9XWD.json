It works well in both cold and warm water, and it is compatible with my HE washer. It also has a nice, fresh scent that is not overpowering. It is a concentrated detergent, so a little goes a long way. One bottle lasts me for 140 loads, which is a good value for money.

                "reviewText": "The soap bottles are very heavy. The caps are not on tightly from the factory. Order this separately from other stuff. Don't order more stuff until it has shipped. The Amazon warehouse people are not smart and probably in too big of a hurry to make sure the caps are tight. Unless you are ok with your other stuff coming covered in laundry soap and getting thrown onto a UPS truck with a couple of big heavy soap bottles crushing it, don't do it. Fortunately the mirror I ordered was packaged well enough that it did not break. Was fun washing the soap off though. Just a tip. You gotta think of what is being shipped with your stuff because they won't. I guess if you don't mind the hassle of sending broken stuff back ignore this.",
