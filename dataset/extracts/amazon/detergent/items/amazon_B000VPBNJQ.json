                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Having used Woolite with cold water on clothing and towels, I would never go back to detergents.",
                "reviewText": "We have been using the conventional liquid laundry detergents, and have seen a lot of fading of colors and shrinkage especially in the length of t-shirts. Most recently, we have tried washing in cold water primarily because this was recommended for new towels we got. It was also recommended to use white vinegar for softening and to seal colors. So far, the cold wash with Woolite and the vinegar has worked very well for our towels. We are now trying this method of washing on our clothes. It won't bring back faded colors or unshrink clothes that have already shrunk, but it may save new clothes. This is one of those things that will take the test of time to prove or disprove. If I don't see an improvement in our clothes and towels, I will definitely update this review.I can say that I very much like the smell of the clothes after being washed with this Woolite. It's not overpowering, but just smells fresh and nice.UPDATE 7/26/18:I have always been under the impression that hot water should be used for whites and warm water for everything else to get clothes clean. Boy, was I wrong!! Since buying the Woolite, we have been washing all of our clothes in cold water, and everything gets just as clean, but there has been no more shrinkage or fading. I still use Woolite and vinegar (for softening) for my towels, and have found that my towels and washcloths don't get stiff after the first use from our softened well water. I also learned that cold water washing can be used with any liquid laundry detergent, but not powders as the powders don't dissolve in cold water. Fabric softeners are fine for washing clothing, but they coat fibers which reduce absorbency of towels.UPDATE 10/21/18:We live in an urban area with hard water that my towels after one use were stiff and scratchy when they dried. I have always blamed this on the hard water even though we use a water softener. I have been using this Woolite for my new towels for about 8 months and vinegar as the softener. I have noticed that after using the towels and they dry, they are not stiff and scratchy. Since using vinegar as a soften, my towels are still as absorbent as when they were new. Since using Woolite with cold water and vinegar as a softener have been the only changes in my towel laundering, I believe Woolite is keeping my towels softer, more absorbent, and has retained the original colors.UPDATE 03/11/20:We have been using Woolite with cold water to wash all of our clothing for almost two years. Clothing we have bought since have shown little if any fading of colors, and there has been no shrinkage or misshaping of fabrics. I can honestly say I would never go back to using detergents that ruin clothing.and towels.I hope this review was helpful for you. I will update this review if my opinion changes.",
