                "reviewText": "The first few times I used these sheets, I had no problem with them. The clothes came out clean and there was no odor or scent to them, which I had to get use to since I\u2019m so use to regular detergent leaving a pleasant sent behind after washing. However, the last few washes, I\u2019ve noticed bit of crusty type residue left behind, especially on my spandex leggings. I don\u2019t like having to peel little bits of crust off my clothes or what kind of damage is being done to my clothes. Thankfully I hang dry my leggings and other workout clothes, so I don\u2019t have to worry about dry heat baking them in. But I don\u2019t like that I have to wash my clothes again in just water after the wash cycle just to make sure any sheet crust is dissolved especially for the clothes I put in the dryer. A second washing kind of defeats the purpose of these sheets being environmentally friendly. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
