However, we don't have the space to store large bottles of detergent and our washer and dryer lids slope, so nothing can be stored on top. Then I saw these and decided to give them a go. We love them. My kids help with the laundry and it has made it so easy for them to start a load. The box takes up hardly any room and yet it typically lasts us a month. The packaging is easy to recycle. The scent is very light and they do not seem to cause my son's eczema to flare up. Our clothes are clean. I love these. I don't see us ever going back to liquid detergent again.",

They smell good and you can pack them in a small space and easily travel with them. I only need one whole sheet (two small rectangular sheets that make one) for a big huge load. I suppose I could use 2 but I felt it wasn't needed. Works well in cold water as well. My mom, who is 80, saw these and thinks this is something she could love so she took a few to try out. I've washed towels, jeans, delicates, blankets, and a sleeping bag with these. No issues for me. I don\u2019t get a strong smell from them personally, I feel like it\u2019s the right amount of smell good - especially after a dry. I\u2019m definitely sticking with these from here on! My brother took a box also as he travels on the road and he loves them as well! I should note that for my top loader washer it works better putting it on the bottom first and then load my laundry in. Even with a soap dispenser that I have it just seems to work better when placed first .",

                "reviewText": "For years I have hated the plastic jugs the liquid detergent comes in... finally found these and have not turned back. Took a bit to get the wife to switch but she now loves them too! No more mess and so easy to use. Clothes appear to always be clean, smell nice and just as good as when we used Tide! Definately recommend those to everyone!",

                "reviewText": "These are so easy! They smell nice, it\u2019s easy to figure out how much per load and you can tear sheets in half. No waste! No plastic jugs or cartons to throw out anymore. It cleans my husband\u2019s grungy shop clothes as well as my delicates and our towels. I\u2019ve stopped using dryer sheets also as they make your clothes get a gummy layer that eventually smells, and the fresh fragrance of these is just clean all the way through the dryer. I use wool dryer balls always now. They last forever. Make your laundry easier. Use laundry sheets and dryer balls. Cleaner, softer clothes with less product and packaging!!",

                "reviewText": "I like that this sheets are a bit easier on our planet, I do what I can-not always enough in my opinion. I have bought other laundry sheets on Amazon before that I like and still use, these are a good size and will last a while. I am a Arm & Hammer user, so now I will switch from pods to these if I can get past the very strong smell. I love linen scent, but these was so overwhelming; I put them up to freshen a closet, until I am ready to use them again. Would I recommend-Yes, would I change scents-Yes.",
