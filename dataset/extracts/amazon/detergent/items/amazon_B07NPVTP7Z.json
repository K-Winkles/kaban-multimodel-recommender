                "reviewText": "What I like most about this product is that it met all of my expectations. I met a lady who was using this product about three years ago and I never forgot the fragrance.It took me a while to remember which fragrance she said she used but once I received my product, I knew that I had the right one. Since I have purchased this product, I have put the fragrance in my car so that I can always have the fragrance around me. I have also put this fragrance in a spray bottle and spray my curtains so when the sun comes through, it gives the best aroma of the fragrance that I purchased which is the Diva version. I love this product and I have recommended it to so many people. I plan to stock up on this product as well as take time to Louisiana so that my family bear can try it. I will definitely be ordering again when my friends came in. They did not know why everything smelled so good and different. I am a person who love great sense, and I love my clothes to have a great scent too.My daughter said to me that I wash clothes so much now until she don\u2019t think I give them a chance to get dirty. But on a serious note, I truly enjoyed this product, but I would recommend it as much as I can. Thank you so much for the opportunity to share my experience.",

I know it\u2019s the Diva wash because it really does smell amazing. I get the gallon jug and only use a small amount of the wash along with a regular no scent laundry soap so it last forever. I also put a small amount in the water when I wash my floors.",
