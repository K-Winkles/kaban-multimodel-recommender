                "reviewText": "I can't say enough about this soap. I've tried so many other detergents for sensitive skin and none of them compare with this soap. It doesn't gum up the machine, there are no dyes, and it works for HE machines. One ounce is enough for a full load of king sheets + more.Clothes come out softer and \"fresh\" - not perfume fresh, but clean fresh. Sometimes it's almost like hanging your laundry outside to dry. I have stopped using dryer sheets and only use my Nellie's wool dryer balls without static over this past winter. My towels love it and \"perked up\" with like-new absorption. I have many allergies and sensitivities including being allergic to my dog. I wash everything from the pet blankets to my delicates in this detergent as a \"one-stop-shop\" and it works great. I can tell when I've washed the pet blankets as my asthma is calmed and skin irritations don't occur when I come into contact.I do use an old smaller detergent bottle from another brand. I refill that smaller bottle and get an easy and accurate pour into the marked cap. What used to be a \"small load\" for that detergent's pour measurement is a large load for Charlie's soap at a single ounce.I have tried Nellie's Laundry Soda powder and it didn't seem to dissolve well. I've read similar complaints from other reviewers about Charlie's powder version gumming up their sewage hoses. No troubles like that here with the liquid. Buy the gallon to reduce the environmental impact of shipping multiple smaller bottles, and love your laundry again.If you've made it this far, you can feel my enthusiasm. I shared the last bit of my bottle with a family member to help them understand how great it is for sensitive skin and non-sensitive skin. I hope this was helpful!",

First of all, it produces lots of suds with only an ounce or two of soap. And it rinses completely clean. It leaves no residue or smell of any kind. I never realized before just how much other products affect clothing, towels, sheets, etc. It's economical as a little goes a long way.

                "reviewText": "Love this detergent!! I originally bought because I had a smaller bottle of Tyler Laundry Detergent and wanted to make it last longer. I started doing a few loads with this to get some off the top to pour the Tyler in the bottle. It cleaned our clothes really well!! My boyfriend farms and when he\u2019s not farming he\u2019s hunting. This got out a lot of grease and hard stains!! I ended up not pouring the detergent in there and will definitely buy more when it\u2019s out.",

                "reviewText": "Love this soap. We started using it, as we are expecting a baby in the next few weeks. Didn't want our little one blasted with nasty chemicals and fragrance, and this soap has worked wonders! I also use it as a spot treatment, and it's been great at removing grease and tomato sauce. The clothes come out smelling fresh because they are CLEAN! We also use Eco Max Hypoallergenic Fabric Softener (also no nasties) to help keep the clothes soft. Great combo. Considering you only use 1 or 2 ounces, depending on the wash size, the soap lasts a good amount of time. Worth the few extra bucks to feel confident in the ingredients. Charlie's Soap for the win!",
