Well with this detergent, you no longer get this feeling. Not only does it wash your clothes extremely well, but it\u2019s made will all clean ingredients. An added bonus is it doesn\u2019t wear away at your clothes like traditional detergents! I have noticed less lint since switching to this one. I use a couple types of their detergents like their activewear one and a small bottle of special fabrics detergent! They all work perfectly! The only thing I would suggest is to break open the pod to sprinkle the detergent on your clothes if you are washing with cold water as the components clump together with cold water!",
