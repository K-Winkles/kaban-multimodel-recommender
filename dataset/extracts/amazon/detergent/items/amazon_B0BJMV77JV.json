                "reviewText": "Shipping issI recently purchased the Tide Simply Liquid Laundry Detergent in the Refreshing Breeze scent, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with its performance. Let me share my thoughts and experiences in this review.First and foremost, when it comes to cleaning power, this detergent delivers excellent results. It effectively removes stains and leaves my clothes looking and smelling fresh. The Refreshing Breeze scent is pleasant and not overpowering, which is a definite plus for me. I appreciate that it doesn't leave any residue on my garments, ensuring they remain soft and comfortable to wear.The quantity provided in this bottle is impressive, offering up to 114 loads of laundry. It's cost-effective and has lasted me for a considerable amount of time, saving me from frequent trips to the store to restock. This is especially convenient for busy individuals or families with a large amount of laundry to tackle.However, I did encounter a minor issue with the shipping of this product when ordering from Amazon. The packaging wasn't entirely secure, resulting in some leakage during transit. It was disappointing to receive a slightly messy package, and I hope the manufacturer addresses this issue to ensure a hassle-free experience for customers.Despite the shipping mishap, the quality of the Tide Simply Liquid Laundry Detergent itself remains unaffected. It's a reliable and efficient product that I would recommend to anyone in need of a dependable laundry detergent. Just be cautious when ordering online to avoid any potential leakage mishaps.In conclusion, Tide Simply Liquid Laundry Detergent in the Refreshing Breeze scent has proven to be a highly effective and long-lasting detergent. Its cleaning power is impressive, leaving clothes fresh and stain-free. While I did experience some shipping issues, the quality of the product itself outweighs this minor inconvenience. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed with the results it provides.",
