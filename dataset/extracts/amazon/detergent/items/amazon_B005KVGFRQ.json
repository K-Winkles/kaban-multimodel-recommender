I bought the smaller package to just give it a try since I\u2019m so sensitive to smell currently, and I\u2019m seriously IN LOVE. The smell is fresher than fresh. I\u2019ve had these pods in the house for less than 48 hrs and I\u2019ve already washed our plethora of blankets and bedding and everything I can get my hands on that \u201cneeds washing\u201d before baby gets here. Besides the scent being perfection, everything feels so clean. I\u2019ve used tide for the majority of my laundering lifetime and idk if anything\u2019s been as clean as it feels now. Anyway\u2026 these pods are fabulous. I\u2019d give \u2018em an 11/5 if I could.",

It gets the stains out much better than sone more costly brands and powder detergent simply often cleans better and/ or is required. I do a lot of laundry and am a clean freak. I have two dogs. I don\u2019t want them, me, or anyone swimming in chemicals. It leaves clothes clean, soft, and has a gentle hue of vanilla and lavender that lingers vs making me itch or giving me a headache.

                "reviewText": "I like this detergent. To be clear, it does NOT smell like actual vetiver (if you\u2019ve ever smelled the essential oil). While the scent is light, it\u2019s more of a perfume-y blend of its own than pure vetiver. I actually don\u2019t smell vetiver at all. That said, it\u2019s good for washing sheets or towels and making them smell nice. Wouldn\u2019t personally want my clothes to smell like it because I like to wear my own scents. I haven\u2019t had the issues with dissolving like some of the other reviews noted. I dissolve mine in a cup of warm water first and dump it into the wash, which takes all of 10 seconds. I recommend if you have $20 to spare, give it a try and see if you like the smell!",

                "reviewText": "I was a little taken back when I saw how small these little pods are but one will do a whole normal load of wash.(I use a top loader) They clean very well and I was surprised. They leave a nice mild scent to clothes. Nothing over bearing, and the scent after dried is very mild.I am sensitive to a lot of detergents and so far, I haven't had any problems with these.The only thing I don't like is they don't automatically dissolve like it states. I ended up having to put them in a cup of hot water and mixing it to get them to completely dissolve. I used them in one piece when I washed some curtains awhile back and it left white streaks. So I have been having to dissolve them. I can also put them in the washer and make sure they are dissolved well before I add the clothes and it seems to work ok that way.But to just pitch in the machine and add clothes and hope it all dissolves, I wouldn't hold my breath.Update 3-2015:I planned to keep using this.Unfortunately the next to last time I ordered this it came completely smashed up all but maybe 3 were broken pods.The next order about 1/4 of them were smashed up. This may be the last time I order this if it can't be packed more securely. It's a shame as I really do like the detergent.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Winter Shipping",
                "reviewText": "I ordered this product in the Winter and received the first package with many of the pre-measured packets burst inside the outer packaging. I called and requested a replacement and one was shipped which also had packets that had burst however, not as many as the first shipment so I kept the second package. I have ordered other GrabGreen products with pre-measure packets in Winter and only experienced packet bursting during shipment with the GrabGreen 3-in-1 Laundry detergent. I do not think it is movement during shipping which is causing the packets to burst since the inside package is well contained to reduce such movement. I suspect the product is freezing during shipment and there is moisture in the product to cause the packets to burst during expansion when freezing or frozen. The packet skins are tightly sealed without much wiggle room for expansion if freezing is the issue.I wanted to try this product as I have tried other GrabGreen products and like their pre-measured packets including how well the other products performed. Since I tend to use more laundry detergent when using liquid I found with the packets I use less detergent. The packets fully dissolved for me when placed in the machine and not the dispenser as directed by the manufacturer. My clothes came out clean however, my Winter laundry is typically lightly soiled and I will need to wait until Spring to try this product with heavily soiled clothing. To me clothes which are clean should be absent of dirt, stains and heavy scents. The fragrance free product, which I used, does not add any artificial scent. Clean clothes to me should be odor free and smell like -- nothing.As for oil there is no brand of detergent that gets oil out well so I always pre-treat oil spots with dish soap. Soap products are different than detergents and are designed to breakdown oils and wash them away whereas, bio based stains seem to do best with an oxygen based booster. There really is not an all-in-one product that will work well with heavily soiled laundry unless you pre-treat, and/or adjust the amount of detergent and/or the length of the wash cycle. It can be expected that you will need to adjust how you wash clothes based on the amount of soil, type of soil, water conditions, washer effectiveness, type of clothing, etc. The manufacturer did recommended increasing the number of packets used if washing heavily soiled clothing.Overall, I am finding the packet system already takes up less storage space, lighter and easier to lift, less bulky and easier to handle, pre-measured so no need to measure, dissolves completely without leaving any residue and does not scent my clothes. High efficiency machines use much less water and powders typically require more water to dissolve powdered detergents completely which is why I went to liquid detergents. So far I have not found any powdered detergent clumps on my clothes with this product and when I do my laundry I typically place the pre-measured packet in the washing machine first then load the clothes.The big test of softness for me is how soft are my dark colors. I always hang-dry dark colors, since drying them in the dryer causes major fading, so having them less wrinkled and not cardboard like once dry is a plus! My rating today is based on my overall experience with the product which includes the use, purchase, shipping and return of 1 damaged shipment out of 2 damaged shipments for this product. I will likely purchase this item again.",

                "reviewTitle": "Dissolves quickly, cleans well, strong-ish scent",
                "reviewText": "The pods dissolve very quickly which I like because I don't like tossing my clothes in the wash until the detergent has mixed in with some water. The scent is a bit strong for my liking but I'm a bit fussy that way. As for cleaning power it's no better or worse than any other brand. Very good value here.",
