                "reviewText": "Herewith, is a short tale of laundry ~Years ago, the Yankee Candle Company made a laundry detergent (yes, they really did) that had an intoxicating scent called Citrus & Sage. I loved it so much that I bought bottles and bottles and bottles of it. I have never found anything that remotely smelled the same, so a pretty sad day for me was soon to come as the last precious bottle from my stash was finally coming to an end.Then in comes Whites Detergent from The Laundress, the fabulous company that has already done the impossible and made me love doing laundry with their lovely products. I have elsewhere recommended their adorable little laundry brush and the stain-removal soap that goes with it.But back to the story. When I opened the bottle, I could not believe my nose! The scent that wafted up from the bottle to entertain my nostrils was the closest thing I've ever smelled to my beloved Citrus & Sage. In a side by side comparison with the remaining few tablespoons of Citrus & Sage, the Whites Detergent was not an exact match, but it is wonderful on its own.The performance of this detergent is also commendable. It's been quite effective on my whites, and honestly, is there anything better than clean, fresh-smelling laundry? I think not.I am thrilled with this detergent on every level upon which one can be thrilled with a laundry detergent.My only quibble is that it does not have a lid that serves to measure the amount to use, therefore, a measuring cup is needed. Unfortunately, that is usually always a messy affair.I can only hope that the Laundress does not discontinue this product. It's a detergent and aromatherapy wrapped up in one.",

                "reviewText": "I don't wear a lot of white clothes, but I do have a few and am always in search of a way to keep them bright and smelling terrific. I was intrigued when I saw the fragrances that the detergent is comprised of, so I gave it a shot.The detergent smells amazing and has a strong scent. It's definitely not going to be a good option for someone who wants a more subtle option, but for those of us who like a lot of scent then this might be up your alley. The consistency of the liquid is comparable to some of the top brands available; it's not super thick, but it's not watery like something you would get at a dollar retailer. The flip cap is easy to use, but there's no way to accurately measure it unless you pour it into a measuring cup. I usually try to eyeball it, and the bottle has enough for approximately 32 medium loads. Larger and heavily soiled loads are going to take twice as much detergent for an effective clean, so the bottle won't last very long at that rate.As for brightening, the detergent performed similar to other whitening products I've used; no better but no worse. While I didn't have any heavy stains, it was effective at cleaning the average load of dirty laundry.Overall it has a wonderful fragrance and enjoyable to use, but it is a bit pricey for the amount you get.",

                "reviewText": "This detergent smells great, works well and you can tell is really high quality. The bottle is large and should last a good while. While the fragrance is nice, it is not overpowering and does not linger strongly on the clothes after washing. I have noticed a positive improvement in my white clothes, but I think this will be really great at keeping newer white clothes white. I have some whites with the usual sweat in the armpit and collar stains and this detergent definitely improve those but taking a proactive approach from the beginning will probably be best at keeping your whites nice and bright!",

It doesn\u2019t contain harsh chemicals that might damage delicate clothes. Plus, a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective choice. However, I do notice there is not a lot of scent, I guess that is to be expected.Whether it's linens, shirts, or towels, this detergent has worked wonders. My husbands shirts do not look nearly as dingy.",

                "reviewText": "When I received The Laundress Whites detergent, I was disappointed as the bottle cap was broken and had fallen off at the bottom of the box. A small amount of liquid was leaking in the corner. The detergent had a faint scent, reminiscent of laundry detergent. Despite the initial setback, I proceeded to use it. Washing my white bedspread with it proved effective, leaving a light scent after the wash. It's worth noting that the bottle is only 32oz.",

                "reviewText": "We got this Laundress Whites Detergent, 32 oz, in Classic Scent to see if it could revive some of our dingy, well loved clothing and sheets. After a few uses, unfortunately, we don't really see a difference.Right away we noticed the scent. It is pleasant but some could definitely call it over bearing. It fades after a little time so I don't see an issue. It seems to clean as well as our usual, store brand, detergent. It might make some things brighter but we didn't notice.Our cap was broken in shipping and, fortunately, the bottle was sealed and didn't leak. It would be nice if some sort of measuring device was built in or included. We had to commandeer an old baby formula bottle to use.",
