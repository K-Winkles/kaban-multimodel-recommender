                "reviewText": "I have been using Grab Green products for years. Everyone in the house has allergies to chemical products and Grab Green is the cleanest I have ever found. The Delicate detergent causes no allergic reactions and has no after smell on any clothing. I prefer this as the pods that have a scent, psychologically leave an impression with family members that there is a chemical in them. I started ordering it on Amazon, because it is a few dollars cheaper than directly with Grab Green, I do not pay for shipping and I get it fast. Because I am always down to my last pod when I realize I need more.It cleans well enough, but when I am washing very soiled items I use a hypoallergenic stronger detergent hiding in the back of the laundry room. I also do not need to use dryer sheets with this detergent either.",

I prefer Seventh Generation pods but those are never available here anymore (Vancouver, Canada) and these GG pods are the next best thing. I have also ordered the GG 3 in 1 fragrance free pods to see if they will work well for all of our laundry. Both are rated as good alternatives to regular toxic detergents, such as the Purex I used to use. I recommend checking out EWG to get more safety information regarding the detergent ingredients, and remember that not all detergents of the same brand are equal when it comes to toxicity.",
