The glass is extremely thin and I was concerned while assembling it that I would crack it and render it useless. However my patience paid off, and I was able to put my laundry sanitizer in this and it works so well. Upon completion of assembly, I added the sanitizer to the dispenser, while the spigot was over the sink, as I was unsure which way was on or off, I was able to figure it out without to much waste. All in all, this was an instant upgrade to my space, and I am thankful for finding, it, recommend.",
