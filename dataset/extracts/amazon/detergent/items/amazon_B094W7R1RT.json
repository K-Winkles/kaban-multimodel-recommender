Standard Machine - Use 1-1/2 Caps / 4.5 tbsp / 2.25 oz What does this detergent smell like? Our lavender Mist detergent is lightly fragranced only with all-natural lavender essential oil. So, it smells like... lavender! That's it. Not too strong, just a touch so it won't overwhelm your senses. Subtle, floral, fresh, and soothing. Why is a pH Neutral Detergent important? A neutral pH laundry detergent like Heritage Park protects delicate fabrics that can be damaged by a soap that is too acidic or alkaline. It's also safer for sensitive skin that can be irritated by a detergent with a high pH. Where are your products made? Heritage Park is a small business based in Connecticut.
