So, I finally decided to try this expensive brand. I am thrilled with it with one exception\u2026.I can\u2019t easily see the lines indicating the product measurements. The red cap makes it difficult to see when the product reaches whichever amount you need. I resolved that by measuring and getting an equivalent number of tablespoons. So now I just measure two tablespoons into the washer for level one loads and rinse the tablespoon with water directly into the machine. (Majority of loads, I need level one for my washing loads.) ADVANTAGES: It washes my clothes absolutely perfectly. No scent, no irritation to my skin. Clothes smell refreshed without an artificial scent. Oh, I recently bought a new Speed Queen washer. The previously used detergents left a residue around the tub. This marvelous detergent DID NOT leave ant residue on the washing tub. Fantastic product. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Persil by far one of the best laundry detergents out there. I have tried their other products known for their strong scents, and wanted one without. This one seemed the best value for its size and also worked with cold washes. It also brightens whites and will eliminate odors.I tried out several loads with varying temperatures and fabrics. I found that this detergent does work best with hot washes over cold, but will do fine with cold washes so long as the clothes aren't too dirty. This can be deal breaker though if you are only looking to wash with cold since I found it actually did a poor job with too dirty clothes. On hot the detergent works great, amazing, and does so much it's outstanding. White towels were brighten and whiten. Black clothing also seemed to be restored and didn't appear as faded. Clothes that have sickly sweet smell from buildup of softener and other detergent smells were eliminated. Skin didn't react as well. The bottle being smaller and more concentrated also makes this detergent more portable and easier to handle. Easy to pour and measure along with a cap that twists back into place for added security.",

Canadian consumers do not want to pay these outrageous prices and your unscented detergent is NOT available in Canadian grocery stores. I have never been able to find it. Nonetheless, no store should be permitted to sell this for $45 CDN on amazon.ca.",
