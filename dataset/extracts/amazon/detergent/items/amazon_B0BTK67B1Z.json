                "reviewText": "When I've switched to other detergents in the past, my family and friends are real vocal and ask why I switched, and that they love and miss my regular detergent, ERA!!! I usually wash my sheets in ERA with a little bleach, and they smell heavenly. Several guests have commented on how great my sheets smell. My family also comments on how great their towels and clothes smell when I wash them in ERA by itself. It has a wonderful, light clean scent that is very mild. I've tried Tied, but the smell is overwhelmingly too strong. No one likes it. So, I have to order it online as none of the stores carry it here on the East Coast of Florida.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first detergent I've ever found that my husband and I will both use happily. While he prefers a heavy duty formula that reliably powers through odors and stains, my extremely sensitive skin reacts very poorly to most soaps, especially those that aren't explicitly mild and fragrance-free. I'm so glad he finally talked me into trying this though! It's the best of both worlds.Even though we pay a little extra to buy it online, the price is still quite reasonable and well worth it. We no longer have to diligently separate our laundry, and we never have to wonder if things got thoroughly washed in the gentle specialty detergents I previously thought were my only options. I've never noticed any irritation whatsoever, and I got to experience the joy of towels and linens that truly smell fresh and clean for the first time.",
