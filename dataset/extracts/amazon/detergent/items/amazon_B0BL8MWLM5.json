                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve recently begun purchasing more wool clothing. I was looking for a good detergent to use for them as well as other things(I use it to wash my Apple Watch bands, works great). This laundry detergent is one of the, if not the best I have used. For the most part I use Tide, but once I\u2019m done with my current supply I\u2019ll be switching over.The little dosing cup is a brilliant idea, and while I could see myself losing it, I appreciate it keeping the bottle and shelf clean from the usual drips of soap.As for the detergent itself, it does a great job cleaning my clothing. I don\u2019t generally get clothing too dirty, so I can\u2019t speak to how well it could handle that, but everything has been coming out clean. My clothes come out and feel genuinely clean and not like they\u2019ve got stuff left in the fabric. I have sensitivities to cleaning products at times and don\u2019t have any trouble with this. I wouldn\u2019t call it scentless, it has a smell, but I find it inoffensive and it doesn\u2019t stay with the clothes after washing.10/10 would recommend and will buy again",

I had been cleaning them with my regular laundry detergent on the delicate cycle prior to purchasing this product. For whatever reason it seemed the laundry detergent was not really cleaning the natural fibers very well. This particular product really got my wool sweaters, very clean and removed stinky under arm, sweat and deodorant debris easily without damaging the natural fibers. I also had really good success using this to wash my delicate bras and lingerie, and it did an excellent job, cleaning the high-quality microfiber and other delicate materials. I absolutely love that this does not have any scent. I Purchased, a very beautiful vintage, angora, rabbit, and wool blend sweater, and I washed it, and I just couldn\u2019t believe how dirty it was, this product left my sweater so clean and fresh and fluffy, it really beautifully restored the vintage sweater to its glory. I would definitely purchase this product again. It is an excellent detergent for delicates and natural fibers. For best results, I air dried all of the items I washed.",

I've been getting more washes out of it, which is good, because I do find it spendy still. It does have a bit of a strange scent to it, even though it's supposed to be fragrance free. I have a pretty sensitive nose, so most people may not notice it, and it's not really a bad scent. Just strange, like I said. Something to be aware of, if you're also sensitive to smells.

                "reviewText": "I don't like my clothes to have a scent, it can be overwhelming to my senses sometimes. This is perfect because my clothes smell like nothing. only clean. I use a laundry sanitizer too, which leaves a really clean, subtle lysol smell that i actually like- so that's all my laundry smells like. i like that it's optimized for cold water too. not super sure what that means, but it reassures me that my laundry is getting as clean as possible even when i wash it on cold (so my clothes don't shrink)",

I thought it was the wool, so I returned it.Later I washed my existing blankets and they came out smelling REALLY weird and then I realized it was the detergent... bleh",
