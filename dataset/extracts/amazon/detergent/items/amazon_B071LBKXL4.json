                "reviewText": "We recently purged chemical cleaning and home supplies from the property, and this was one of three brands of laundry detergent tried (I tried the variety sampler pack in these first, and I\u2019ve since gotten two full-sized bags of these pods in different scents), the other two being liquids. I don\u2019t have concerns over these ingredients, and the smell is good, clean, non-irritating, and nature-derived - it really makes our conventional brands seem even more chemical-laden and makes their toxic scents seem far worse. These rarely leave residue despite our hard water and being powdery in the pods; I\u2019ve never had any brand/type not occasionally leave some residue, especially on certain dark fabrics, so that\u2019s no big deal - it brushes off, can be rinsed, or often it comes off in the dryer. They sometimes don\u2019t dissolve fully on light-agitation washes, but they still clean, just leaving a tidy, hard clump of detergent. This clump is usable for another smallish load, and it\u2019ll clean just as well and impart the fresh scent - I consider these two-for pods many times! While the fresh clean scent stays but isn\u2019t annoying (even stronger scent would be fine to me since there are no dangerous chemicals here), it endures and reactivates once folded laundry is brought back out. I like all the scent varieties (plain, or what\u2019s dubbed rain, I don\u2019t use because I want some fragrance), but I haven\u2019t bought my favorites in big sizes yet because some other scents have been more economical for the same amount of product. It\u2019s amazing this rose-scented one is indeed floral and rosy, yet uses a smart combination of essential oils to create this scent, not even using oil of roses or relative scent rose geranium; that\u2019s cool chemistry at work. These are well done and now a regular purchase for us. As long as Grab Green keeps up this good work and value, there\u2019s no need to change now I\u2019ve found a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "Discovering this detergent has been a game-changer for me! It has quickly become one of my all-time favorites. The delightful fragrance, coupled with its gentle yet effective cleaning elements, has successfully prevented any irritation to my skin. What sets it apart is the lasting freshness it imparts to my clothes\u2014something I rarely find in other detergents. Surprisingly, even scents that typically linger longer than I prefer have become a welcome feature because of the captivating aroma.The variety of scents offered is impressive, each contributing to a delightful laundry experience. Not only does it leave my clothes impeccably clean, but the fragrance also lingers for just the right amount of time. It's a rare balance that's hard to find, and this detergent nails it. The pleasant scent adds an extra layer of satisfaction to the entire laundry routine. I wholeheartedly recommend this detergent to anyone seeking a perfect blend of cleanliness, skin-friendliness, and long-lasting fragrance in their laundry essentials. It's a must-try for those who appreciate both functionality and a touch of luxury in their everyday chores.",

Then another broke open, and another... they don't seem to stay in the pod. I don't know if they got damaged during shipping or what. the scent didn't stay on the clothes after washing, which is sad but fine. The soap itself smells good and is clean. the olive is the best scent. Also wash on warm or hot, they don't dissolve in cold like at all. I eventually just ripped the pod open and dumped it in. I wouldn't buy again. I wish they would come out with normal powder cleaner in these scents.",

The rows one is hideous. The oak one is the best. The olive leaf one is also very good. They are musky, so if you like floral or citrus they won't be for you. The oak one smells like an expensive hotel, I love it. They clean well toiz better than most bougie laundry detergent but not as good as say, Persil, which is imo the best detergent for cleaning, but these are still very good, as well as delicious.",

I have yet to have those issues with these pods and I've used them regularly for a few weeks. I wash my clothes very often and haven't had any problems with soap residue or the pods not dissolving fully. Plus, the pods are eco-friendly and the bag is paper which is wonderful. I always feel guilty throwing out those huge plastic containers that traditional laundry pods come in. This is a MUST buy for anyone!",

I had been searching for info about Amway's SA8 and, based on various comments that had mentioned Grab Green's product, decided to get this product instread. What a mistake! I followed the instructions for a top loader and put 2 pods into the bottom of the machine, loaded my quite dirty laundry into it and set it on the wash I needed. Afterwards I placed the laudry into the drier. After the drier finished I took ut the items and was immediately struck by how little the laundry had been cleaned. In particular a dirty bedsheet came out exactly the same as before it had gone in. To say I was shocked is an understatement. The seller, to their credit, refunded me the cost after I had explained to them what had happened as they had initially wanted the product back unopened. I would not in a million years ever use this product after whyat I experienced and am going to throw the rest of the product out into the garbage. Needless to say, I am having the SA8 powder sent to me from England by my sister. Why? Because it cleaned all the blood out of my polo shirt, shorts and even canvas shoes (after a misshap I had) when I tried it. Never had that happen with ANY powder.",
