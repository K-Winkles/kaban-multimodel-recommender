                "reviewText": "About a year ago I had to replace my washer. I loved my 28 year old Amana. I don\u2019t like the new washer I have and one reason is because the cloths don\u2019t seem clean and there were always White detergent marks in the clothes. We tried everything to fix this. I decided to try PODS. These PODS work great and I will continue to buy them. Never thought changing from liquid to PODS would fix the issue! THANK U AMAZON!I highly recommend these PODS. They were a good value too.",

                "reviewText": "It does dissolve in cold water.I have a 3.0 cu washer, so for me one pod is enough. For regular house hold washers on large setting, you will need two pods.I have read some of the reviews, a few mentioned that the pods doesn't dissolve in cold water. So what I do is I put a pod in let the washer fill with water a few inches and \"as my hubby says\" I play with the pod, I swish it around in the water until it is completely dissolve. Then I put my laundry in. By doing this I have no problem with the pods.I got the lavender! It's not over powering with the smell, but enough for me to smell it!! And so far it cleans great!!Would I recommend? Yes!!!Now for those who have the twin tub portable washers. One pod would be way too much.",

                "reviewText": "These are okay. If you don\u2019t have anything stinky going in like sweaty gym clothes or soiled doggy stuff or whatever, it\u2019s alright, and it\u2019s less expensive than the name brand pods. But I have two dogs and three kids and a husband who gets kinda stanky :) at the gym, and I don\u2019t find that the odor fighting ability with these is all that great even with vinegar and scent boosters\u2026it all comes out the same\u2014less stinky, but it still doesn\u2019t smell totally fresh. I can still smell dog in the dog blankets and sweat in my husband\u2019s tank tops. I would still pay the extra money on Tide for smelly stuff, but if all you\u2019re washing is your day-to-day clothes and kitchen towels and such, this works just fine. There\u2019s no magical stain fighting to it, so I\u2019d recommend using hydrogen peroxide and dawn dish soap for stains before washing. If you want a one and done pod, I don\u2019t think this will be it. If you don\u2019t have a particularly dirty life with lots of sweat or kid messes or dog messes, this might be your best money-saving option.",

Super affordable for how long it lasts! The lavender scented one is my favorite. It smells lovely but isn't overpowering. Does clean really well, takes care of all my toddlers messes on their clothes!",
