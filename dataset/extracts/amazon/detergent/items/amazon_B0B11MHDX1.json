                "reviewText": "Wow. Where do I even start.I have tried a LOT of detergents. And most of the other laundry detergents I never could try because of the crazy strong fake flower smells.What I love:EWG rating. (Does not poison Aquatic life, does not cause cancer, does not cause reproductive harm, and no plastic.) ... I feel like all laundry should have these requirements but this is the only one I have found that actually cleans.Does not bug my nose when I open the container, when it is sudsing up the clothes for the water to clean them, when the clothes are in the dryer drying OR when I have them on my body. ( Note: Tide will have my throat titning at each of these stages and I am usually coughing over and over again because I am that sensitive.)Our sensitive skin family has never had a problom with this product. Even babies. I clean our cloth diapers with this soap and never have needed to strip them because the soup does not leave any buildup.And I love the pods after having to deep clean our previously used washer mechine due to liquid detergent being caked on it.(inside and out. It was so bad the clothes had a hard time getting clean due to the damage that detergent did to that mechine.)I always batch buy on black Friday as those are the best deals of the year. (20-30% off yes please)Amazon does free shipping so it is cheeper to buy on the site rather then the Aspen Clean website as they no longer offer my address free shipping.Down sides are 1: If I order from Amazon sometimes the pod rappers have devolved leaving the soap as non contained powder at the bottom of the container (assuming from a slight moisture problom in the warehouses .) But I have always just shaked the soap in the washer after using the full pods and it all works in the end. I am fine with this as I am saving money through buying from amazon.Downside 2: I find that I need to run laundry on warm water to get a really good clean. But I have also found that cleaning with warm water just cleans better in gAmazon.10 out of 10.",

                "reviewText": "Update: tried both the lavender and the eucalyptus scents. Neither scent lingers for very long at all. On one occasion, I did receive a shipment with broken pods, but that didn't bother me much. It seems when I order only detergent and nothing else from Amazon, the product ships straight from the factory and is fresh and in good shape. Otherwise, it might come from a warehouse somewhere and be older, hence the dried out pods? Who knows.***Overall, I am very happy with the performance of this laundry detergent.The pods arrived, shipped directly from Aspen Clean, in great condition. They were intact; nothing was broken.I used one pod per load in my compact front loading washing machine and added vinegar instead of softener. There was no residue from detergent powder when the cycle was through. The pods seemed to have dissolved completely.I bought the unscented variety. The laundry smells great: like NOTHING at all! Even cotton t-shirts that usually have some sort of musty smell after being laundered smelled like NOTHING. I had that problem for years with some Lands' End shirts: I would wash them, and they'd smell really weird, even though they hadn't been particularly soiled. That smell is finally gone, thank goodness.I have tried other \"green\" detergents before (liquid ones), but they typically would leave my clothes smelling \"musty\" and unpleasant. Aspen leaves them smelling clean, without scent.If you have problem stains like tomato sauce or marker, you will still want to pre-treat them. I use a plant based stain remover spray from my regional grocery store chain. Even so, a shadow of the tomato sauce remained on the item. Maybe soaking might do the trick.The laundry even seems to dry faster, if that's possible. I line dry, and the first load already started to feel dry when I was finished with the fourth load.I will definitely reorder this product and am happy with its performance.",

I tried it on different cycles with different water temperatures, but still, they do not dissolve. Disappointing. I will have to go back to their regular liquid product or try another brand.",

EWG rated!It works well, clothes are clean, and no harmful/artificial smells.....but, I just received this months order and the pods are all dry and discolored, like yellowed plastic. And 90% of the pods were so dry they were split and all of the powder is loose. Similar to a few of the other reviews I've seen.I'm returning for a replacement, I'm still willing to give them more chances because i feel the product is worth it.Will update if I receive",

On a good day, his clothes smell unscented and \"clean\" which is the goal. On a bad day, his clothes still have a mildewy/residual smell, which I then have to rewash using tide detergent. Due to the high price and low-strength to deep clean I am only willing to use them on my baby's laundry for now.",
