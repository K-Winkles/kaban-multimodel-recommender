My clothes colors are brighter, the stains come right and I fell better knowing my family is cutting back on all of the harsh chemicals. Two bags last my family of 4 about 3 months.

I will be recommending it to everyone who is still using liquid detergents!",

It cleans well and there is no residue left behind so that\u2019s a bonus but the powder has a super fine texture like tiny dust particles and it floats in the air with the slightest movement. I have asthma and I am extremely sensitive to a numerous scents and chemicals. Even though the powder is unscented there is still something in this product that causes my asthma to flare. I will keep the product and next time I will wear a mask when i put on the next load to wash and see if that will help. If that doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll just let someone else do the laundry. :)I would recommend this to anyone who is not sensitive to fine powder/dust, as the product does work well and there was no odor.",

Smells amazing, I get completes from friends when they come over and I'm just done laundry, they say it smells fresh but not perfumy. The sent in the bag smells really strong when you open it, kind of like inhaling powdered hot chocolate. But once its added to the laundry and it's been in the drier, it's a very nice mild but still noticeable lingering smell. Very nice. The enzymes clearly work, they've helped pull really old smells and oils from clothes that didnt come out from any conventional detergent. Must have in a home.",
