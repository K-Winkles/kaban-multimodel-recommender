Our only complaint was that it didn\u2019t always dissolve well when we put it in the washing machine drum. To fix that, we now put it in the dispenser. So far it dissolves completely when we put it in the dispenser. I haven\u2019t had to wash out any stains yet so, I\u2019m not sure how it will do with stain fighting.",

                "reviewText": "Eco-friendly laundry sheets are a game-changer for those seeking a greener approach to laundry care. These sheets typically come in a compact, sheet-like form and are designed to be eco-conscious from production to use.One of the most significant advantages of these sheets is their environmental impact. They often require less water and energy to produce compared to traditional liquid or powder detergents. They come in recyclable or compostable packaging, reducing plastic waste. Additionally, they're lightweight, which can save on transportation emissions.Using eco-friendly laundry sheets is a breeze. You simply toss one sheet into the washing machine with your clothes, and it dissolves during the wash cycle, releasing the detergent. This simplicity makes them ideal for anyone looking to simplify their laundry routine.These sheets are often formulated with biodegradable and non-toxic ingredients, making them safe for the environment and sensitive skin. They are also free from harsh chemicals like phosphates and sulfates, reducing the risk of skin irritation and allergies.However, it's essential to note that the effectiveness of these sheets may vary depending on your water quality and laundry load. Some users may find them less effective on tough stains or heavily soiled items, so pretreating stains may be necessary in some cases.In summary, eco-friendly laundry sheets are a commendable choice for individuals looking to reduce their environmental footprint while doing laundry. They offer convenience, sustainability, and gentleness on the skin. While they may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for every laundry need, they are a step in the right direction toward more sustainable and eco-conscious laundry practices.",

Now we've had a chance to use them on everything from very soiled stuff to just regular daily laundry. WE LOVE THEM! Easy to use, no big plastic jug that is messy and takes longer to use. They're great, you can choose between a half-sheet to 1+ for bigger jobs. We've never seen them leave pieces or bits that didn't dissolve. These sheets are our new go-to for daily laundry.",

These laundry sheets clean perfectly. Sweat, concrete, dirt, food, you name it. Better than any liquid detergent and the 200 loads last a really long time. I'm still on my first box and will buy another as soon as I run low. I'm allergic to fragrance so these are perfect for my sensitive skin. My husband adds sented bead to his loads and we're both happy with every wash. Plus they take up no space and I don't have to get rid of big plastic jugs. 10 out of 10, highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I tried these a year or so ago to see if they lived up to the hype. They do! I took over the laundry from my wife who had always used Tide. I remember throwing the big bulky plastic containers in the trash for many years. Now, I just reordered with a box of 100 sheets, good for up to two hundred loads as the sheets can be torn in half for smaller loads.As a widower, I pretty much only have smaller loads...I love getting the scent free version, as I like not smelling like perfume.I have found the sheets work well on light dirt and the heavy dirt I sometimes have after hunting or hiking. I highly recommend these easy to use sheets.Oh, yeah, I appreciate the good for the environment stuff, but really, I actually care about the ease and convenience of using these great for the environment sheets. If they were hard to use, I would probably wimp out and keep using the now unused half container of Tide.",
