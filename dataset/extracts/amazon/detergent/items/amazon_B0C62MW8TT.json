                "reviewText": "Eco Clean Dryer Sheets Long Lasting Hypoallergenic Scent ALL NATURAL-80 Loads -Dehydrated Liquid-less Biodegradable - by Coc\u00f3 MarchFirst impressions: The fragrance is very strong, I could smell it even before I opened the box. The scent doesn't seem to bother my allergies while others do.Installation/setup: Use in dryer with wet clothes to reduce static and improve softness.Final thoughts: These work pretty well, the fragrance doesn\u2019t linger too long, but does last into your storage to keep your clothes fresh until you wear them for a bit. They do reduce static, it\u2019s a problem where I live. I like this and I\u2019m glad I got it.\u2b50\ufe0f1 star - I don't recommend it at all, poor quality.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 2 stars - I don't recommend it, it has multiple faults, or a very high price.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 3 stars - It's passable, It has some faults but the quality is ok for what it is.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 4 stars - Product quite acceptable, it does what it promises.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f 5 stars - Product that I totally recommend.",

It\u2019s pleasant but VERY feminine and smells nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like sweet honey. I have no idea why they even named it that. It\u2019s not that strong either, does not last. Maybe I got a bad batch, I don\u2019t know. But this is a terrible product.",
