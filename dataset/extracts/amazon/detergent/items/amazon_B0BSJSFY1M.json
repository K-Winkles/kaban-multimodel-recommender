Each Tide PODS contains breakthrough 3-in-1 laundry solution with super-concentrated detergent, stain remover and color protector that is specially designed free of dyes and perfumes. Simply put in one pac for most loads, but use two pacs for large loads and three pacs for extra large loads. For a simple, worry-free laundry experience that's gentle on skin, Tide PODS Free & Gentle laundry detergent will keep your family looking and feeling great. It outperformed the leading free detergent on 10 different stains (1).Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds.(1) under standard single-wash conditions on Polycotton fabric in a standard top-loading washer",

Also they are easy to use. Just drop them in the washer drum then put in the clothes. My clothes come out clean, smelling fresh and fragrance free.",

A little disappointing because I got the smallest size so if I did that I would blow through the amount I have right now. Honestly I just use 1 no matter the load size and it works just fine. There's no scent like advertised. I have eczema/sensitive skin and these work well to make my clothes softer. Itchy sweaters are no longer itchy! Honestly I highly recommend these pods.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Tide Pods since they came out. The convenience is wonderful and I never risk overturning a box of laundry soap ;-)!!! Espcecially important if you tend to be a bit klutzy or move faster than you should!!!They have always done a fantastic job on all our laundry from undies & socks to towels - to very dirty work clothes. I use 2 for my extra large capacity loads and 1 for regular ones. I use cold water unless absolutely necessary or for whites - especially my white cotton towels and have never, I mean never, had anything come out less than perfectly clean and beautiful.I have sensitive skin, subject to itching and drying and the Free and Clear ones work great with no irritations.Highly recommend - it's worth the price - I think it cost less in the long run - using fewer pods & less water to get the job done well and saves me time - my most valuable commodity.I've never had one leak before use. They may get a bit sticky in our humidity but pop apart easily.Word of advice - I keep the container lid snapped at all times - I don't want to have to \"find\" the ones that fall down between or behind the washer and/or dryer.",

Works very well with normal loads but not as well with delicates / handwashing cycles. On these (given the lower water temperature and shorter cycle) the pod doesn\u2019t fully dissolve and the outer surface is left as a gooey substance on clothes. For these loads I now place the pod inside a small washing bag and then clean this out afterwards. Not a big issue but something to be aware of.",
