                "reviewText": "I've used Tide laundry detergent since I can remember growing up in the 60's. It's whole marketing pitch was that it was the best at getting stains out, and clothes clean. I think it mostly fulfilled that claim, but the perfumes and additives were nothing I cared for and possibly worse. When Tide came out with Free & Gentle (sp?), I used it mostly for the last 20 years or so (the pods for convenience). It seemed to be the best overall in my near 60 years of experience to date. 7-2023Lately, In order to save money, I searched for the \"perfume/dye-free\" version of Tide for less money since I can no longer afford what I could. I purchased this Tide with Oxi hoping it would be okay. Sadly, ... it seems to come close to the cleaning power Tide has been known for, BUT it has a scent I would NEVER go back to. I think this product and marketing still targets young people on a budget that think it \"smells clean\", and don't care much about added chemicals. Until they realize it might be important to look at a laundry detergent with less chemicals that are usually not so good for your skin and body, this detergent seems like a good choice. In the future, you might possibly attract a partner who doesn't think the smell of Tide is meant to be your hygiene statement...let alone a slice of your personal style. If you're young, and you can listen to a smart guy, you won't wait too long for the future.ss",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I tried the cheaper brands in my young married life. The commercial where they show you how much water is in the \"other brands\" is oh, so true. No matter how much of the cheaper brands you use in the washer, nothing really seems to get clean. So even though a jug is cheaper per jug, you are using lors and lots more of it, lugging in multiple jugs at a time. Then back to Tide and stains that the cheaper brads left in your laundry for months and months are suddenly gone, For tough stains, I use Tide directly on the stain, with or without a little water, let it soak ii and work overnight and when I wash it the next day, most stains are gone and forgotten.And when I found it online here for an eve better price than most of the local grocery stores, and delivered to my door, I became a regular customer.",
