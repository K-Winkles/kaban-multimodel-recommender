They work to a degree, but even doubling up the number of sheets they don\u2019t work as well as the liquid detergent we\u2019ve been using. They also end up being a more costly option. I\u2019m hoping my favorite detergent comes up with workable water disintegrating sheets some day. Three stars for effort.",
