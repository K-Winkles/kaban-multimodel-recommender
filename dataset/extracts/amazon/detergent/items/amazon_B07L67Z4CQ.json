This detergent smells clean but not flowery. It cleans well, too. I use it for my dress clothes, gym attire, and shop rags, and everything comes out clean and fresh. It takes very little detergent to do the job, too, so a bottle easily lasts longer than a month. I haven't felt the need to use fabric softener at all, and my clothes are still soft and wrinkle-free.
