                "reviewText": "Galitoon laundry detergent sheets did a respectably efficient job of cleaning.SHEET DISSOLVABILITY:I used two sheets for a large load, per instructions, in cool water.There were very little temporary suds, which is normal for natural surfactants. More suds do not mean more cleaning power with natural surfactants. I placed clothes in washer, placing the 2 sheets on top of a dark colored item, directly under the water source to see if they would melt as expected. There was NO problem with sheets dissolving. There was no sheet residue on either the clothes, or the machine sides.CLEANING: As an extra test, I included in this load a couple greasy spotted pot holders. Both of them came out clean, with no sticky residue from remaining grease, so it seems they washed up beautifully.SCENT: The sheets have a lovely light scent which does not overpower, and is not present when clothes are removed from dryer.Overall, I am convinced you may use these sheets with confidence. I am pleased with my results, and would purchase again.I hope my comments help you.",
