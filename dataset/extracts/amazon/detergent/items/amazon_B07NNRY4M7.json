We're a family of 5 with 3 kids who are constantly making a mess of their clothes plus two active parents with a lot of sweaty gym clothes and I have only great things to say about these. They're so effective!! Takes out stains and odors. We've tried both scent free and the scented option and we like both. I'm super sensitive to detergent smells and love how gobeyond has very mild scent- but the overpowering ones of most big name brands. Also love how portable they are! We take them on vacation to be able to wash clothing as we go.",

                "reviewText": "I'm still debating on whether or not I will stick with these or not and here's why. I absolutely love the concept of this. It's incredible the amount of waste when buying the big liquid tubs of laundry detergent. So that is incredibly appealing to me. I've found that they are cleaning the clothes and come out smelling clean but not that \"Awww clean\" smell. I hope some of you all will get what I mean by that. I'm happy overall with the product and it is doing what it said it would do. I think I may be used to the scents in the other and it may just take getting a scented sheet or actually getting used to the fact my clothes don't have a smell after washing. I'd recommend folks try these out as they are doing the job and cutting down on my recycling.",

This is the second order for me they lasted about 18 months which is about 5$ week for myself and my husband, plus lots of company. They are really nice to add to a travel bag taking no space. They take little space to store and are so much cleaner then the liquid or powder. The hardest part is teaching guests that just one strip 2x5 inch is enough for a large load.",
