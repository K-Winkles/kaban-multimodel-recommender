                "reviewText": "I've tried a lot of different laundry detergents for my athletic clothes, but this one is by far the best. It's specifically designed to remove sweat and odor from synthetic fabrics, and it really works! My clothes always come out smelling fresh and clean, even after a tough workout.I'm also impressed by how effective this detergent is at preventing musty smells. I used to have a problem with my athletic clothes getting stinky if I didn't wash them right away, but this detergent keeps them fresh for days.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this laundry detergent. It's the best I've ever used for my athletic clothes. It's effective, affordable, and easy to use. I highly recommend it to anyone who works out regularly.Pro Tip: Be sure to rinse out your synthetic workout clothes with water (I usually do this in the shower immediately following my workouts), wring them out, and hang them dry before throwing them in the hamper. This has been a game-changer when combined with this laundry detergent come laundry day.",

                "reviewText": "Rockin\u2019 Green Laundry Detergent has been a game changer for my laundry routine. This detergent is simply awesome, especially for workout clothes. It does an excellent job at eliminating odors and leaving my clothes smelling fresh and clean.I usually mix it with my regular detergent and do an extra rinse, and the results have been consistently impressive. The detergent works wonders on towels too, leaving them soft and fragrant.One of the standout features of this detergent is its ability to tackle particularly stubborn odors. For instance, I often soak my husband\u2019s shirts in this detergent, and it works miracles on them. My husband tends to have sweaty pits, and if this detergent can handle that, it can handle anything!In conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable, effective, and powerful laundry detergent, Rockin\u2019 Green Laundry Detergent is the way to go. It\u2019s proven its worth in my household, and I\u2019m confident it will in yours too. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I use this in conjunction with my regular liquid laundry detergent on my towels, my husband's stinky work clothes, and work out gear. It does smell a bit of tea tree oil but the scent does not linger on my clothing. My towels have lost that mildewy smell and our clothes don't have that sour sweat smell any longer. My hubby works outside in the heat so this is really impressive! I have been using this detergent for about 2 years now. I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any issues. It dissolves really well so you aren't left with any residue. I have actually mixed this with mop water to help remove dog urine odor and it was surprisingly effective when mixed with DAWN dish liquid, white vinegar, and hot water.",

I soaked my scrubs in it overnight and all the smell is gone. Not to mention a whole lot of other gunk! The water was literally brown. And I thought they were clean! Wow. I have used for regular washing too. I feel like it works pretty well and makes the clothes really soft. It is expensive, but I think it\u2019s worth it. You only need a little bit, so it lasts for a while. I would def recommend for stubborn smells. Used it in our duvet cover as well. Liquid detergents are so bad for the environment, I feel like this is much more eco friendly. And easier to carry up and down from the laundry room in our building.",

                "reviewText": "I teach hot yoga and train hard in the gym, so my workout clothes get SWEATY.I've tried other \"active wear\" detergents, but this Rockin Green works the best for me.I typically soak my workout gear about 30 minutes in a bucket, then dump the whole bucket into the wash along with a small amount of regular detergent.One other note; I do hang my sweaty clothes up to dry while I collect a load of laundry. My wife does not appreciate me mixing my active wear with the general house laundry. Do not let your wet, sweaty laundry fester in a pile or gym bag.If your active wear gets funky, try this; it helps strip the sebum (skin secretions) from the fibers via enzymes that break it down... hence why soaking for a bit helps.",
