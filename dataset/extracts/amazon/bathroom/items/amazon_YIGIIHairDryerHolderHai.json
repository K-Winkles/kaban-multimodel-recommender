Basically my stuff had been taking up my bathroom space so I purchased this as well as this cute little shelf thingy and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was enough to hold all my hair care shtuff but I stand corrected. It holds my hair dryer, curling want, straightener and beach waver as well as other miscellaneous items. It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of cabinet space and fits perfectly. It\u2019s sturdy and easy to put together.",

The hooks to hang it on the door are too short, so the hair tools prevent the door from closing. I had to attach wires to hang the basket lower, then it slides side-to-side, so I had to attach the stick-on hooks that are meant for wall hanging. I would not recommend this item unless you have room for it to just sit on the counter.",
