                "reviewText": "I was looking for a new scale to replace my aging one and I found this offering. Hesitantly I purchased it since the price was right and I figured even if I get 3 months use out of it, I would be satisfied. But, to my surprise, the physical unit is actually well made, with precision and quality materials. Another plus is the lightweight design and sleek look. I tested the VeSync app and that as well is actually pretty well designed, with an easy to understand interface to navigate with. the Bluetooth connectivity is streamline and very response. I am using an android based phone.Overall, I would highly recommend this product after testing it. You really can't go wrong with this item. It's nice to see some companies still stay competitive while offering a great product at affordable price which is build with a quality mindset.",

As soon as I unpacked the scale I used it right away and didn't have to worry about adding battery's which was really nice since I always forget them. I live in an apartment so the scale doesn't take up that much room and supper light if I want to move it around. It has bright lights so you can see the number on the scale. Its fast and easily to use, all you do is just step on the scale and it tells you the weight in seconds. I was nervous about getting something that was too cheap thinking that it wouldn't work but I LOVE it and I love how clean it looks to go with my esthetic of my apartment!",
