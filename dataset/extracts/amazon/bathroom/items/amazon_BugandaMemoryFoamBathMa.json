It also does not slip or slide on our tile floors, so it's very stable when getting out of the shower (no worries about it flying away under your foot).When I write reviews, I try to think of a downside just to be completely fair and honest, but I really don't have a downside for this bath mat. It's just great. The only thing I can think of is that it is rather tall, so if you have a smaller bathroom, you won't be able to shut the door if it happens to be in that area. This isn't an issue for me, but it's may be something to think about in a small space?Anyway, great bath mat!",

But this product compelled me to write it so that others don't make the same mistake I did in buying this product. It's supposed to be a bathroom mat. It is supposed to absorb water. It's the worse bathroom mat ever. My flooring can absorb more water than this. Returned it immediately.",
