And once I cleaned these, they returned to some extent, but are very easy to clean.However, we had deposits along the vertical tracks of the water as it enters the bowl from the holes under the rim at the top after each flush. They were minimal and I hadn\u2019t thought to clean them\u2013big mistake.Unfortunately after using this product a few weeks, those deposits along the vertical tracks were stained blue. Worse those blue deposits were incredibly hard to clean.",

                "reviewText": "Decided to try these toilet pods to keep things fresh and blue in the bowl. Here's the scoop after giving them a go.Pros:- They do exactly what's promised\u2014turn the toilet water a nice blue and leave a pleasant smell.- While they may not last an eternity, the quality during their effectiveness is top-notch.- Perfect for concealing stains, especially with well water. Some stubborn stains persist, but the blue water helps mask them.- Last longer than other brands I've tried, providing a decent duration of effectiveness.- Pleasant smell without an overpowering color, and they seem to last longer due to this balance.- Clear and straightforward instructions make placing the tablets in the tank a breeze, requiring a 30-60 minute wait for optimal results.Cons:- The longevity might not be the strongest suit, so if durability is a priority, exploring other options could be wise.- While they help maintain a reasonably clean bowl, they won't replace the occasional need for manual scrubbing.- Color release might be less vibrant with shorter intervals between flushes, but this seems to contribute to a longer-lasting effect.Additional Thoughts:Overall, a solid choice for toilet maintenance. I will definitely be ordering more of these. Hope this review helped!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for a few months now. It seems to keep my toilet bowl fairly clean, but note it prevents stains it does not clean stains. I live by myself so the toilet doesn't get flushed super often I would say two or three times a day and one tablet will last me about 3 weeks to a month. Pretty crazy value for what you get. It has a very minor scent that you can only smell if you get super close to it, most of the time you won't even know it's there. The tablet inside the tank does slowly break apart and become a kind of sludgy material, so make of that what you will.Let me get to the real reason though why I'm writing this review at all because there's lots of other people recommending this product but nobody has been able to clear up whether it's safe for septic tanks or not. And the questions and answers section and in the review section there's people saying it's safe and there's people saying it's not safe. I have attached two photos of an insert card that you get inside of the box which details the ingredient list and is the only place I could find the ingredient list, note that the box itself does not say the ingredients only this insert card that's inside.The ingredients are as followed: sodium sulfate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, food blue no. 1, parfume, fatty acids, coco, lipase, triacylglycerol, subilisin, cellulase, amylaseApologies if any of these words are misspelled, I merely spelled them how they are on the insert card from the box. I googled each individual ingredient because I don't know anything about this sort of thing and I couldn't find anything saying any of these ingredients was bad for septic tanks.I don't claim to be the be-all end-all on this subject, but I wanted to put people's minds at ease who were worried about this particular topicAll in all a pretty great product that I will continue to purchase in the future and I highly recommend it. I took one star off because of the weird sludgy material that the tablet leaves behind in the tank. It also takes quite a bit of time to fully dissolve, I would say around 1 hour or more.",
