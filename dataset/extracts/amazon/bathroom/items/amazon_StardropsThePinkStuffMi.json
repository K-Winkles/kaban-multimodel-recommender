What I really love is that it cleans great and doesn\u2019t make you feel like your going to pass out after you cleaned. The smell isn\u2019t too strong. I spray and let it sit for a bit and watch it just wash away the dirt. The hype is definitely it for the pink stuff!",

It cleaned our grimy faucets beautifully but we bought this intentionally to try to help us remove a hard water stain on black tile that we've been trying to remove since we purchased the house. We've tried every cleaner in every store it seems like, and even many home remedies but have still not found a product to remove the hard water stain. Love the easy to use spray bottle and how accessible this product is in bigger stores",

My grout looked so orange you\u2019d think it was intentional (with bad taste,ha). We spent $$$ to have our bathroom redone in 2021. Turns out, the natural stone grout we picked was a poor choice for our area (eastern TN, Appalachian mountains). Within 6 months the hard water had built up(even with regular cleanings) so badly that I wanted to redo the tile completely!! I just wanted to get rid of my grout! Turns out- pink stuff was all I needed. I tried all the more natural options first, out of preference and some things made a small difference but with this I literally watched the limestone and iron RUN done the walls and down the drain!!!My arms are sore but my heart is happy!!!Only thing I\u2019d change is the unnecessary added fragrance. We\u2019re already damaging our lungs inhaling the surfactant- why the added perfume chemical concoction?Would appreciate a scent free but will continue buying it because of the excellent results!",
