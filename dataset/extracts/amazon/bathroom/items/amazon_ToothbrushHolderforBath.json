I will be looking for a tray for the bottom as I have kids who soak my counter but I wouldn't call that a design flaw. The holder is good for the price, even if I have to buy an additional piece. Looks nice and neat on the vanity. I can see this lasting despite the fact that my five boys abuse and destroy everything in their paths.",

                "reviewText": "I've always hated the common toothbrush holder cup. Whatever water drips down it stays in the cup which is hard to access since there are only about 4 standard small holes. They are hard to clean. Even though you can get one with a pretty decoration it doesn't matter if its hard to clean. I also needed to find a toothbrush holder that holds the toothbrushes of a family of 6. Since I have a small bathroom with messy young children, I need something that's easy to clean, its my top priority. I had to find a tooth brush holder that wouldn't collect toothpaste water. So when I found this I was so happy to use it it. It has 6 slots, which is prefect for the amount in my family. It also doesn't collect toothpaste water. The only things is that the larger space, I assume that is for toothpaste, is for standard size toothpaste containers. I use the hello brand toothpaste (which is on the wider side) and we need 2 kinds(one for adults and one for children). So the toothpaste part, for now stays empty. But overall I'm happy I found a toothpaste holder within my budget.",

Love that it holds the toothpaste as well. Best part is no yucky stuff to clean out of a cup or on bottom of the holder. Important with kids. Wish I bought it sooner! Also great price that is affordable. Love it and highly recommended!",
