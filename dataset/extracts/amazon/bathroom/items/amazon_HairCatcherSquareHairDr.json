                "reviewText": "This hair drain catcher was exactly what I was looking for. I have very thick long hair and often lose quite a bit of it in the shower. I also live with my best friend who has the same issue. With both of use losing a lot of hair in the shower, we were having issues with our drain clogging. We tried multiple different hair drain catchers, but kept having the same issues. Then I found this one! Since I purchased this drain catcher, we haven't had any issues with our drain clogging. I was worried the holes would be too big and our hair would slip through, but they're the perfect size and catch all of our hair! The only thing is that it sometimes slips around as the suction is not super strong, but it still remains over the drain, so not a big issue to me! Definitely recommend this product! Easy to clean and use, and it comes with two, so added bonus!",

It does move around a bit, but it's not much and it doesn't bother me, I just move it back with my feet. I was concerned that my hair would go under the catcher and down the drain since there's no suction to keep it flat, but if hair does slip through it's very minimal. After every shower, there is a normal amount of hair on top of the catcher. I think it works well. It also doesn't get slimey like some others have.",
