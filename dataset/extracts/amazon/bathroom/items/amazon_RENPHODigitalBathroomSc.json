Recently had to go to the doc for the first time in a long time and found that fully dressed weight was about 3.5 lbs more than my weight on this scale that morning. Seems pretty accurate to me. Battery life has been good which was a big problem with my last scale, so I like that. Only down side might be that it's a small platform to stand on. I'm pretty small (5'2\" size 6 ladies shoe), so it works for me and fits nicely in a small bathroom, but if your feet are larger, you might have a hard time seeing the numbers. On the other hand, the display remains up for a bit after you step off, so you could read it then if you need to.",

You can\u2019t throw it around and slam it down and just keep it in a nice corner somewhere and it does pretty well and it\u2019s a nice looking scale too. Very modern looking.",

                "reviewText": "I like everything about this scale. My old scale was so clunky but this is compact and very streamlined. I was worried about the glass top but it's secure and sturdy (I am plus size). I thought the white numbers might be difficult to see against the gray background but they are large, crisp and well-lit. Another plus is that the readout holds after you step off the scale (makes it easy to weigh objects that might obscure the display). I checked accuracy against my other scale and they were both spot on. As to longevity, who knows but the price is great and this scale covers all the bases for me.",
