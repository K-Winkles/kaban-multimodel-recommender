The rod isn't super heavy but it's also not light either. The curtains I hung on it are shear so they didn't add much more weight, so I'm not sure it would work as well with say heavy blackout curtains or something. But maybe it would! I'm impressed! And they look really nice too \ud83d\ude01",

Needless to say, that didn't last long, and where the screws came out, the finish of the door was a mess. So after researching several options for hooks that would be sturdy enough to hold hangers and would adhere to the door, I tried these. I am so happy with these hooks. They are sturdy, adhere well and look nice where installed.",

I purchase this pack of hooks so that I could use them for multiple purposes. When I stuck the first one to the wall, it fell off the next morning. I thought the hooks were not going to work for me, but it was my fault I learned because I had forgotten to clean the spot on the wall first. After doing that, and installing another hook, it has remained sturdy even with constant hands grabbing the towel from the hook. I would buy these again as I also like how they look.",
