They are definitely worth the money & I cannot believe they aren\u2019t charging more for them. I got the two pack. One for the bathroom & the second for my daughter\u2019s room. If you\u2019re wondering about whether or not to get them, DO IT!! You will not be disappointed!",

However, we didn\u2019t want something that shines all night because it\u2019d be in our master bath shining into our bedroom all night long, impeding our sleep.Enter these adjustable brightness nightlights!! We put one in our master bath. We just turn it off during the day and turn it on when we need to use it at night to get ready for bed or use the bathroom. It works wonderfully! AND it looks lovely on or off. Super thankful I purchased these.",

The ones I received today have no sensor hole, I tried to find one but failed, so it shuts off in light. The 3rd pic is from the video on the amazon product page, note it shows a dimmer slider, which none of mine have. It's a cute little product, don't know why they keep removing functionality (without changing the description).",

These have a great modern look so they kind of blend in, you can choose the color and the best part\u2026it\u2019s dimmable!! I have the bathroom one on full bright so you can see what you are doing in middle of the night without having to be blinded by turning on the light. And ones in bedroom and hall on a bit lower so it\u2019s not bothersome to sleep but also still doing its job.

The perfect nightlight for an affordable price for our bathroom while our son night time potty trains. Also love that it leaves a socket open so I can still use the outlet while the nightlight is plugged in!",
