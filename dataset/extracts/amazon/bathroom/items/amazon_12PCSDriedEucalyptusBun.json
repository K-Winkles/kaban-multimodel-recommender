            "\ud83c\udf43[High-Quality Eucalyptus Leaves] - Our eucalyptus leaves are sourced from natural farms and treated with safe, preserved technology to maintain their fresh appearance. They are fresher, easier to care for, last longer, and retain fragrance better than fake eucalyptus stems and dried flowers. This truly dried eucalyptus bundle is the perfect companion for your shower, bringing natural aroma and adding a real eucalyptus scent to your shower experience.",
            "\ud83d\udec0[Perfect Eucalyptus Shower] - You will receive a shower bouquet containing 12 fresh eucalyptus leaves, with a length of 15 to 17 inches. Each eucalyptus shower bouquet is carefully selected and packaged in a beautiful box. Our eucalyptus leaves are of higher quality and have a more fragrant scent compared to other brands.",
            "\ud83e\udee7[Healing Eucalyptus Scent] - Eucalyptus has a distinctive peppermint-like scent and is often used in aromatherapy to promote relaxation, relieve anxiety and clear the mind. Our Immortal Eucalyptus Leaf retains the original floral scent of the Eucalyptus leaf, making it a great companion for relaxation and stress relief.",
            "\ud83c\udf80[Versatile Use] - A soothing blend of real eucalyptus into the home to immerse yourself in an environment of pure well-being and relaxation. Eucalyptus can use the eucalyptus shower bouquet alone or combine it with dried lavender and flowers to add a refreshing fragrance to your shower time.",
            "\ud83d\udc8c[Care Tips] - To keep these natural eucalyptus stems in good condition, it is recommended to dry them after use. Due to being in a humid environment, the green glycerin liquid will separate, but don't worry, it's safe. To prolong the life of your bouquet, hang it between the shower head and the wall to prevent hot water from dripping directly onto the bouquet."

It smelt good when Fresh out of the box but when I showered with it, it was leaking green water so the color was coming off as if it was fake. The eucalyptus smell went away maybe 2-3 days later. I\u2019m used to my eucalyptus lasting almost 2 weeks (from Trader Joe\u2019s) with the smell releasing with a steamy shower. It still looks pretty but smells like nothing.",

My only down side was I wish I ordered longer ones (I didn\u2019t measure before hand- I\u2019m a more visual person) and I wish the base of the stem didn\u2019t have leaves. That\u2019s an easy fix on my end.I thought they were perfect for what I needed!Also, I got a note when I ordered which really changed my perspective on how I would write this review. Sometimes we forget there are true humans on the other side of the screen.",
