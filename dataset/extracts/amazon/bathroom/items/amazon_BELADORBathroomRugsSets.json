                "reviewText": "This two-rug set was just what we needed for a bathroom in our home. Good-looking and soft. They also look like they will last a good while. And the price was nice. As some reviewers have said, they will slide around. I knew that and I don't mind that. A tip: don't buy white bath rugs. They get dirty so fast and are hard to get clean in the wash. I like getting something in a gray or taupe--they stay looking good for longer.",

They are super soft and comfy to step on, and they don't flatten out and look like felt like regular carpet-type rugs do. Really happy with these! I will say I have not washed them yet, so I can't speak to how well they hold up. I would not put them in the dryer.",

I wish they had a bit more padding but for the price, it's hard to complain. Great value! Time will tell how they hold up, but so far, so good!",

It's pretty hard to find, actually, and ivory is a very subjective color. But the pictures on Amazon looked right and the price was good. I am pleased. These rugs are a little too shaggy to be absolutely perfect for my bathroom, but they are absorbent, really comfy, dry fast and don't slip. I really, really wish they sold towels to match, because, again, it's really hard to find the right shade and advertisement photos and dye lots can be way off. Even the one I am posting doesn't do the color match justice. Oh well. Hey Belador! Make matching towels!!",
