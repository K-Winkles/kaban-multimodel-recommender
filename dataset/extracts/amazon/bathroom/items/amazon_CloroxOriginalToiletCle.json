The amount of cleaner/sudds this offers is phenomenal. This toilet wand cleans the toilet, is easy to attach and release the scrub pad, and the perfect size to sit right in the corner. Great product and easy for kids to you use as well to learn household cleaning. I let my toilet get extremely dirty outside the 2 week routine to see if this toilet brush could hold up. It took 25 seconds to have my bowl clean again. Took the grime right off! I chose the original scent but am eager to buy replacements in another scent.Update: 10/10 do not recommend with children under 4 unless you keep the refills hidden or would just enjoy the refills flushed down the toilet, causing it to clog.",

These are great, you can throw them away, if you buy in bulk to cost is manageable, especially if used together with the Scrubbing Bubbles gel stamps. I only need to give the inside of the bowl & under the seat a good cleaning once every 10 days or so & these clean real well. Very easy to use, The pad pops right into the wand, and when finished cleaning it comes off the wand into the garbage with 1 push of the only button. I was surprised by how much cleaning product gets on the toilet bowl, you can use 1 replacement pad for 2-3 toilet bowls, fully covering every inch of the bowl & seat with cleaning product. It smells nice and clean. Will buy again & again.",

It's a simple yet highly effective system that makes toilet cleaning much less of a chore. Here\u2019s my experience:Ease of Use: The ToiletWand is incredibly user-friendly. The handle is comfortable to hold, and attaching the cleaning heads is a breeze. It allows for easy reach inside the toilet bowl, making cleaning under the rim and in hard-to-reach areas effortless.Effective Cleaning: Each disposable head is preloaded with Clorox cleaner, providing a thorough clean that I can see and smell. It's effective at removing stains, eliminating odors, and disinfecting the toilet bowl, leaving it sparkling and hygienic.Hygienic Disposal: The no-touch disposal design is a standout feature. With a simple click, the used head goes straight into the trash, meaning no more storing of a germy toilet brush. This system is much more hygienic and convenient.Storage Caddy: The included storage caddy is compact and discreet, making it easy to keep the wand and refills neatly stored in the bathroom. It\u2019s a tidy solution that keeps everything organized and ready to use.Disinfecting Power: Knowing that I'm using a product that disinfects and kills germs gives me peace of mind, especially in a household bathroom that gets frequent use.

The want is so easy to use, just push wand into a pad until it clicks and you're ready to use. There's enough soap on the pad to clean even the nastiest toilet. Push a button and it uncle's from wand into garbage. Amazing and no more gross toilet brushes in the bathroom!",

                "reviewText": "I have a toddler who loves to get into things. This ended up being such a great purchase for me because I could finally get rid of those nasty toilet brushes that he insisted on trying to get into! It is super easy to use and clean/sanitize after cleaning your toilets, and the brush heads come with the sanitizing cleaner already built into them. The only cons are that I have found are that the brush heads sometimes come apart from the wand while you're trying to scrub the toilet (which is really frustrating) and also that the brush heads are single-use, which is bad for the environment and your wallet. If not for that, I would totally love the concept!",

Also it\u2019s easy to attach the pad to the rod & to detach & discard after use.",
