                "reviewText": "I bought this to use in my 5th wheel in which I live full-time. The toilet mfg. says not to use a regular brush because it will ruin the seals. I've already had that problem. For various reasons, I purchased a new toilet and decided to give this brush a try. So far so good. It does take a little getting used to scrubbing with the silicone vs bristles and takes a bit of elbow grease. The brush seems sturdy enough to handle it. I do like I'm able to shake off the water and therefore, don't have hardly, if any, standing water in the toilet holder.",

But this color matched my bathroom, and I wanted something that didn\u2019t scream \u201ctoilet brush\u201d. Well, I\u2019m officially sold on the silicone brushes after trying it! My house/toilet is super old, so there were some spots in the bowl that didn\u2019t come off, even with soaking in toilet cleaner or bleach and scrubbing with the old brush. I say \u201cwere\u201d because this brush somehow got rid of them! Not sure how, but after using some basic blue bowl cleaner stuff, I barely had to scrub with this and they were gone, as was the slight overall yellow discoloration that I\u2019d figured was permanent staining from age.So, you may not experience a miracle like I did\u2026but this thing will get your toilet clean and the holder looks nice too",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison: Boomjoy vs Lefree vs Sellemer",
                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure which of the three I'd like best. I was intrigued by the flat, triangle shape of the Sellemer. I liked the round, compact look of the Lefree, and the Boomjoy had a nice tweezer attachment (which I can use to clean out hairs in my shower drain). Also, Boomjoy was the cheapest of all three.**UPDATE** The Boomjoy metal handle has now gotten rusty and looks gross. So I would NOT recommend this one.So you can see in my photo the type of packaging they come in. The Sellemer and Lefree both also come with a little plastic piece that you can stick to your wall and hang the brush on your wall. Not really sure I care to do that, though.I also placed all the brushes next to a coffee mug, so you can see approximately what the sizes are. I like the Sellemer in that it's svelte. The Lefree is also quite compact. The Boomjoy has the largest base, so it would seem to take up most space. But the size differences, as you can see, are minimal.The brushes in the Lefree and Sellemer \"hang\" to drain, that is when you put the brush into the holder, it's suspended and there's a ventilated bottom. The Boomjoy is a solid bottom piece and the brush rests in it, like a bowl. I suppose that can cause some water accumulation and won't dry as easily/quickly.All three required the handles to be twisted on, which were easy enough on all three. I liked the handles on the Sellemer and Lefree over the Boomjoy. The Boomjoy was the only one that had a metal part to the handle, but for some reason it felt a bit flimsy. The other two had all plastic handles.This is the first time I tried silicone brushes, and overall I like the way the clean/work over the old bristle ones.Sellemer: I thought I would like the triangular shape as it said it could get under the lip easily. But in trying all three of them out, the flat, triangular shape actually made it feel a little flimsier, so I didn't feel I could brush as hard against the toilet. I did like that there seemed to be good density on this one with the silicone bristles.Lefree: This one looked like it was most lacking in silicone bristles. They were all spaced somewhat far apart. But, it still seemed to clean fine, and I could press it up against the lip of the toilet and it got under there just fine. Just as fine as the Sellemer. I felt I could press pretty hard against the surface of the toilet, too, to scrub some of those harder water stains out.Boomjoy: This seemed to have more dense silicone bristles than the Lefree, but less than the Sellemer. It also worked much like the Lefree. I could get under the toilet lip easily and scrub pretty hard against the toilet surface.Honestly, they are all \"Made in China\" products, so the quality is all pretty much the same. So what you are really deciding on are small features and which style you like the best.Personally, knowing what I know now, I would buy the Lefree. While the bristles were the least dense, it seemed to clean just as well as the others. It has a small footprint with a ventilated bottom. I just didn't really care for the flimsy feel of the flat triangle Sellemer. And the Boomjoy's non-ventilated bottom bothered me a bit in that I think if water were to gather and drip when I pick it up next time, it would be gross. I do like having the tweezer, but is it really necessary? It also has the largest base. I do like its very sleek look though, and the fact that it doesn't put its brand across the base.Also, if price is of concern, the Sellemer was most expensive at around $15-$17 depending on when you buy it. I see a lot of price fluctuations. The Lefree is around $13. And the Boomjoy was $9.99.Overall, all three worked pretty well, and I think I will stick to silicone over the bristles from now on.",
