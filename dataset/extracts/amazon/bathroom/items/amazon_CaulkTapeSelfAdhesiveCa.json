                "reviewText": "I just sealed the bathtub and toilet where they meet the floor, and this stuff went on like a dream - and even had a little left over from the one roll of tape. It's thick, but quite flexible and a bit stretchy, so it conforms well to the curve around the front of the toilet pedestal. In an old house like this, the toilet installer had to shim the pedestal to make it level, leaving six or eight millimeters of gap in the front. This hides the gap beautifully.Working in tight spaces, it wasn't always easy to get the mid-line crease of this tape to line up with the junction at the floor. I found that if I folded it in half sticky side out before applying it, I got pretty good alignment. Be careful, though - the adhesive is pretty aggressive, and you might not get a second chance at positioning it after it's made contact.Since the installation is minutes old as I write this, I can't speak to its longevity. It's a good bit thicker than duct tape and the glue seems to do its job well, so I'm not much worried about normal cleaning loosen up the tape or rubbing through it. Based on my experience so far, I'll come back to this whenever I have the same kind of sealing job ahead of me.-- wiredweird",

Clean floor and edge of bowl where tape will go. Beginning at rear of bowl start installing by peeling tape cover and carefully mounting tape to floor and bowl. Proceed around bowl to wrap the entire bottom all the way around to the starting point. Using a heat gun or hair dryer on the tape and bowl bottom will make the tape more flexible and easier to work with. Don\u2019t rush it.",

When I got to the first curve I freaked a bit that it wasn\u2019t going to lay flat, but a few seconds with my hair dryer and it smoothed out super easy. Make sure you clean and dry the surfaces very well, I even wiped them down with rubbing alcohol. It came with a little wipe but that seemed insufficient to me.I\u2019m not super handy, but the end result was a clean crisp finish and took me about five minutes.",
