They didn\u2019t hand flush to the wall with the provided screws so going to stop by Lowe\u2019s tomorrow to get something that works better. Overall great shelves and value, just a little more work than expected",

They take a lot of work to get into the wall, but if you work to hard at it or make the initial drill hole too big they will fall right out or push into the wall too far.Although it looks nice at a glance, the wood boards are very light, soft, and cheap feeling. I understand it's probably to allow the bars to be screwed in easily, but a nicer wood with pre-drilled holes would be preferable.I suppose you're getting what you pay for.",
