                "reviewText": "I learned about this product from several, very experienced, house cleaners. The original product smelled icky.... The rain scented product that I recently got, is fine. It is not so overpowering and it leaves a pleasant scent, and the shower smells and looks very clean.My shower wall tiles are white with white grout. My floor is a mix of stones and ceramic tile, with white grout. My shower was pretty clean (I had scrubbed with a different product recently), but I want to improve the color of the grout and keep the soap scum down.As the housekeepers do.... I sprayed most of the walls and floor and then let it sit 10 minutes. Setting longer is better per the housekeepers, but I was in a hurry. I sprayed and a lot of yellowish film went down the drain, even though the shower had been thoroughly cleaned just a few days ago (with a different product) and the shower had not been used since that cleaning. I then sprayed the remainder of the shower walls & floor, waited 10 minutes, and rinsed. Zero scrubbing. The shower looks and smells great.Professional cleaning people told me the first things they do when starting to clean a house is to spray scrubbing bubbles into the showers, bathtubs, and toilets, and they let that all sit while they do a lot of other work around the house. The last things they clean are the showers, tubs, and toilets, and so the scrubbing bubbles sits there a very long time when they do this. All turns out very clean and it is efficient, without a lot of scrub a dubbing.",

                "reviewText": "I moved into an apartment that no one cleaned before I came in. The yellow tiled shower walls are lovely but were super scummy, crud all around built in soap dish, mold in the grout...a general mess. I acn say without reservation that Scrubbing Bubbles cleaned this mess and let my bathroom gently scented and sparkling. I sprayed as directed then I did scrub with a brush. While the scum was fairly melted, it did need some elbow greasse and hot water to wash it all away. Highly recommended!",
