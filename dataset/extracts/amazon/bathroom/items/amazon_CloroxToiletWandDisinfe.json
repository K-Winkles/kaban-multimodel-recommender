The convenience and value of these refills cannot be overstated. They attach easily to the ToiletWand handle, making the unpleasant task of scrubbing the toilet less of a chore and more of a quick, hygienic errand.Each disposable head is preloaded with Clorox cleaner, which gives me confidence in the disinfecting power I've come to expect from the Clorox brand. The Rainforest Rush scent leaves a fresh and clean aroma, which is a welcome departure from the harsh, chemical smell often associated with bathroom cleaners.The packaging may vary, but the effectiveness remains consistent. With 30 refills in one package, I am set for quite some time, which is not only convenient but also cost-effective. These refills, when used with the ToiletWand system, offer a sanitary solution by eliminating the need to store a germ-ridden toilet brush.For anyone looking to streamline their bathroom cleaning process while ensuring their toilet is left spotless and germ-free, the Clorox ToiletWand Disinfecting Refills are worth considering. They're a staple in my home, and I appreciate the cleanliness and ease they provide.",

                "reviewText": "Say goodbye to the smelly old toilet brush that sits in the holder next to your toilet and say hello to the easiest way to keep your toilet fresh and clean without all the hassle of having the multiple steps of getting the toilet bowl cleaner, squirting it in the toilet, putting it away, getting out the toilet brush, cleaning the toilet, then having to rinse it off and put back in the little caddy where it drips water and sits until you use it again, and having to do that long process all over again, no wonder we dread cleaning the toilet. Make things simple and convenient and you will do it more often and dread it a little less. So yes, while it might seem a little more expensive or possibly wasteful to use and dispose of these little disinfecting refills, it will certainly clean your toilet amazingly, leave it smelling great, and with a touch of a button throw it out and put the handle away and you are done. I am not sure what magic they put in these little things, but they work like magic and can get some of the hardest water stains and buildup out (used at a friend's home who has really hard water build up and they had tried everything, brought this over and it was like magic and with a little elbow grease it was taking it off), and there is plenty of cleaner in one of these pads, I will usually be able to take a little disposable trash bag and carry the one I am using from one bathroom to the next and be able to clean both of my bathrooms with one, so it is less expensive and not wasteful. This was the best price I found online and certainly better than the grocery store. While I am still not a fan of cleaning the toilets, I can tell you this sure does help!! Great product, great quantity in this refill box, they are packaged in sleeves so you can place in multiple restrooms for storage until you need to use. Five stars, and a repeat customer.",
