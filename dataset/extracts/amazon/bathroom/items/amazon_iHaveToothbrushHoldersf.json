The spot you put the toothpaste in has a lever inside it that manually squeezes the tube. The extra shelf space Is nice too. The little drawer is a nice feature as well. Moreover, it holds up pretty good ,did not have to use nails to keep it attached to the wall.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked the feature that this toothbrush holder offered and even watched the video to make sure it is something that would work in our household. I also read and watched the reviews from those that already have and are using the item.The setup was fairly easy with the adhesive part being the hardest in the process (leave overnight to ensure it fastens to the wall). It can take a bit of time, also, when ensuring you are placing the adhesive (and the entire setup) so that the holder is leveled and not leaning right or left.One concern that a reviewer was actually kind enough to make a video out of was the \"mess\" the toothpaste dispenser creates. This part of the apparatus is quite narrow with the dispensing mechanism, the part that is pushed by the toothbrush to allow for the dispensing of the correct amount of toothpaste, located right in the middle of the hole. There is really no way to squeeze anything in there to be able to clean it unless using a cleaner the size of a q-tip. Additionally, q-tips are not meant to be used to clean small appliances since it is somewhat fragile and is not strong enough to scrub. I guess it can be cleaned if you remove it from the wall and run it through a sprayer. I thought I could create a workaround by wrapping the dispensing mechanism with plastic wrap, that way we can just remove the plastic when it requires replacement. However, this did not work as the holder is made of hard shiny plastic which the (plastic) wrap does not adhere to. We used the dispenser for about a week until we just gave up and stopped using it altogether.As is, the holder just became a better, more organized place to put our toothbrush and toothpaste on top of. The built and color (white) is nice but the functionality may need some redesigning so that cleaning can be easier.",

                "reviewText": "Comes with 4 cups.. I have 3 kids so each kid has a cup & mom/dad share a cup. It holds up to *8* toothbrushes. It has 2 nice sized drawers for storage. I keep my rings & cotton rounds in one drawer, and toothpicks/teeth care in the other. It has a toothpaste dispenser.. i just don\u2019t have any in it right now. I have before and it works as expected.I comes with 2 long sticky strips to stick on the back of the device to attach to the wall. I did try to stick it to our wall which is paint, and it fell a couple times. So I had to end up sticking it to the middle of our mirror which is fine with me. Its not in the way of being able to see ourselves because we have a double vanity. (It does say in the description that it won\u2019t stick to painted walls so I did have a warning, I just wanted it on the wall at first). However!! I\u2019ve only had to use one of the sticky strips even after it falling twice and reapplying it several times! If you had to or just wanted to use another method of hanging it like command strips I have seen other reviews that has worked for others. But the strips it comes with work really well!I have heavy weight on top of it (full bottle of mouth wash) plus other stuff and it has held up ever since I stuck it to the mirror\u2026 so as long as you listen to the description and stick it to the appropriate surface, it\u2019s durable!The toothpaste dispenser isn\u2019t the easiest to clean, but I think that\u2019s with any dispenser. I just use a wet Q tip to clean up the left over toothpaste.Overall this purchase frees up counter space and looks nice. I love this storage solution!",

Have to make sure that your toothpaste tubes have a screw top- not the smooth stand alone to use the toothpaste pump feature. Toothbrush hangs behind the cover.

Now some toothpaste tube tip won't fit in the dispenser because they are to large , like the hello brand , so when shopping for toothpaste check if the one you use had a finger size tip , not a large one . I just want to mention that a sticked mine on a painted wall many months ago and the thing has never fallen down . The only thing I did was wash the wall with alcool then let it dry before applying it . Then I did not attach the holder on the adhesive until the next day to give it time to settle in .",
