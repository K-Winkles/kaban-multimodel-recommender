It holds 3 bath size towels with no problem.The instructions included are super simple to follow, holes are predrilled, I like the fact they include a piece of paper to put on the wall so you know right where to screw everything in - I didn't use that but it's definitely helpful to have.The only thing is get some actual drywall anchors - the ones included did not work for me - but otherwise, they include an extra screw / anchor in case you lose one. Took me all of 10 minutes to assemble and put up. Definitely recommend for something simple and easy to upgrade your bathroom!",
