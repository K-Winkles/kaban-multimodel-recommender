Perfect for use in between deep cleans. Super thick and bubbly foam coats and cleans as the suds stream down into the tub or shower. Use after a deep cleaning and you will significantly extend the time between the next deep clean. U can use it in the sink too if needed.",

                "reviewText": "I am embarrassed to say that I created my own plumbing disaster by using and flushing obnoxious amounts of non-flushable wipes over an extended time period. For some dumb reason: I thought it only mattered if one had a septic tank. The day an impenetrable clog from hell had formed sent all the worst stuff back into the house? It was worse than you'd imagine. An excellent plumber snaked my system and fixed the problem. I had bought gallons of bleach, Clorox scrub, but I also ordered this spray for cleaning the awful mess left inside the entire floor of the stand-up shower, and the tub in the other bathroom, and for the toilets.Cleaning this mess? Required the bleaching products and a hot-water rinsing. But then it required a solid deep-cleansing overall with a new sponge and this product as the final step. This worked beautifully! The bottle is deceptively large and full. It is of high quality. The sprayer is even better, dispersing a thick, wide amount easily. And the solution itself worked brilliantly. It was unbelievable just how clean this spray left the showers: the walls, corners and floors. They were absolutely sparkling and smelled nice, never looked better. I will continue to buy and use this impressive product. Sorry about the gross story. But I thought this showed its cleaning power under the worst of conditions. And now I no longer flush anything but toilet paper.",
