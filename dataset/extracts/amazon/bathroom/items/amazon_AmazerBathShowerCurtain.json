The width and length were a perfect match to keep water from escaping from the sides; a problem I have had with other shower curtains. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the thickness of this shower curtain. It is paper thin and any puff of air from our furnace or breeze that happens to be passing through the bathroom blows this curtain against me while I'm showering, and is a pain to deal with. The magnets don't hold against these puffs of air or breezes. The size is great, yet the thickness is terrible.",

                "reviewText": "Initial impressions are that these clear shower curtain liners are well made, relatively thick, and clear like glass. Because they are so clear, when in use they create the illusion of more space in the shower, since all you see is the outer curtain which is outside the tub (as if they aren't there). No idea if this will change after some use when they gather some dirt. The liners are also reinforced with metal rings where they meet the hooks so seem better in that sense too (for durability and ease of putting them on hooks).",
