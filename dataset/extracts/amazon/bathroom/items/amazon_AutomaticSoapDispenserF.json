The most appropriate ratio is 1 hand soap : 3 water, which can be adjusted according to the desired bubble concentration. Q: The soap dispenser works, but no bubbles come out? A: The initial judgment is that the outlet is blocked. The solution is to add warm water and adjust it to the highest level for repeated induction and dredging.",

We recommend that the ratio of ordinary hand soap to water is 1:3, and the amount of hand soap should be more than less. Shake well before turning it on.You can feel it when you stretch your hand over, but no bubbles come out? Only a small amount of liquid comes out? Probably due to the blockage of the outlet, the hand soap was not shaken evenly when adding the liquid, which caused the hand soap to precipitate, or the ordinary hand soap was directly added to cause blockage. It is recommended to add warm water and adjust to the highest level for repeated induction.The product you are browsing now is a foam type. If you add foam soap, you can add it directly. If you choose ordinary gel soap, please dilute it with a ratio of 1 soap: 3 water before adding it.No response to charging? Due to the fact that the product is sometimes turned on during transportation, the battery is completely drained. After receiving the product, please continue to charge it for 1.5-2 hours, and then use it after it is fully charged.No reach sensor, but the soap dispenser foams by itself? We recommend that the machine be installed at a distance of more than 20cm from the countertop to prevent false induction caused by reflections on the countertop.Can't use a soap with particles, such as starlight hand soap, fluorescent hand soap, etc., particles can cause blockage.We support after-sales service for one year, if your return window has been closed, please take the initiative to inform us, we will solve the problem for you, thank you for your support.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought two of these for our bathrooms. I had a different motion sensor one with temp in our one bathroom but it randomly shot out soap, a joke in the family. And it then just stopped working on us. I got this after. I was hesitant because it sticks and stays stuck on the wall. It sort of ruined my wall in one spot because I didn\u2019t plan it very well. But that\u2019s because of the space in the bathroom, where my little can reach easily, and where the plug can access it easily. But once all set, it was great! I just don\u2019t like how low I have it. But that\u2019s on me. It still works great there. That one has ONCE randomly ejected. The other one in the other bathroom after it emptied stopped working. So I wrote to the sellers and asked for help with the product. They helped me to try and resolve the problem. However, that one just didn\u2019t resolve. Other issues I had resolved eventually. But the soap coming out never did resolve. It made the noise. But it wouldn\u2019t send any soap out. So they gladly sent me a new one. Which is up and running great! With customer service like that it just helps you to feel supported by your purchases. And they said to reach out any time with problems. I feel backed by my product then. Like I\u2019m not just buying something and that\u2019s it. So many times I read reviews and people are trying to figure out how to return. Or hating what they bought and feeling stuck. So knowing I have the help of the seller behind me on my purchase makes me feel like what I bought is worth the value of my money. In todays economy where we\u2019re all struggling with inflation you don\u2019t want to buy something and then have to toss it one month later. With this if it stops working you can contact the seller and they\u2019ll help you to resolve the issue. I love that 100%. This hand soap dispenser was worth the money for me. I have two boys who love to play with soap. So leveling out the soap is a nice bonus. And the ability to not have touch any surfaces is something I love since I\u2019m autoimmune. I\u2019ve been trying to switch to all automatic where I can to help with that. So I love how easy it is to use. How effective it is. It recognizes my hand under it vs when I\u2019m just standing there so it doesn\u2019t eject soap like the old dispenser would. It tells time which I LOVE! So I have one clock ahead and this one on time to help me in the mornings keep track of my time. And it tells the temp so I love that because I\u2019m always curious how warm it is in a room because I\u2019m always cold, so this helps me prove I am cold, or actually just off on my body chemistry. Anyway you look at this dispense it\u2019s just a great value for your money. It charges super fast. I DO have to charge it about once a week. But we have a lot of traffic in both bathrooms so it\u2019s always picking up movement which drains the battery. I COULD turn off the human recognition and then just stick my hand under to use it. But it wasn\u2019t always effective that way for me. And with two small boys I want 100% effective every time so they\u2019re not going to be crazy boys and get into trouble because something didn\u2019t work. But there\u2019s lots of options with this dispenser. I suggest just reading the manual carefully when you get it and tinkering around with it once it\u2019s charged. And don\u2019t just say, I got this! Because you will forget, so keep book handy too for WHEN you forget and a problem ensues! I was reading it again yesterday after getting the new one and laughing because I\u2019d read all of it. And here I was having some of these issues. And forgotten all that I\u2019d read thinking, I got this! It\u2019s JUST a soap dispenser! Like it says, clean after each cycle of filling. Something they\u2019d told me too when they\u2019d helped me. So just having it on hand to help you will be a smart lesson I\u2019m learning from my own mistake. It\u2019s not JUST a soap dispenser. It WILL have issues. So have it on hand to know how to handle them if they come up.",

Unfortunately, after almost a year of every day use, it clogged up. Just like the manufacturer recommended, I poured in warm water and tried dredging; but it stopped working. I tried dredging every time I walked past it for days after. Eventually, I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a replacement. But, I think I got a lemon because right out of the box it did not work. I tried dredging but that did not work. Luckily, I had made a video of the entire thing. I sent that to the seller and they promptly refunded me. Now I\u2019m off to order another one. I love this gadget so much that I\u2019m willing to keep trying until I get one that works.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought two of these for each bathroom. One of them works pretty well, but the other will not dispense any soap at all & the sensor is horrible. I just hung it up on the mirror, filled it with soap & nothing comes out at all. I can hear the motor run, but zero soap. The sensor also barely works, you have to put ur hand under it like 3 or 4 times & be very intentional, actually touch the sensor, to get it to work & dispense soap, but no soap ever comes out. See my video above. And it is not the soap I bought cause it\u2019s foam soap, specific to this type of dispenser, & is the consistency of water\u2026 u couldn\u2019t get this soap any thinner unless u just put straight water in it. And this same soap works fine in the other dispenser I have in a different bathroom. So\u2026 quality control is not good\u2026 u basically have a 50/50 shot of getting one that works properly out of the box or one that will not work at all. I\u2019m going to try to return this broken one, but it was trash day at my house & my husband accidentally threw out the boxes they came in. Not sure if I can exchange it without a box or not. If I can\u2019t return or exchange it, then I literally threw my money in the trash cause the defective one is completely useless. I tried doing the auto clean thing to see if it would start working after doing that, even though it is brand new out of the box, but that did not solve my issue. Also, be careful when removing or putting on the rubber seal where the soap goes in. The gasket is very cheap & not well made, so when I put it back on, it went right through the hole & into the dispenser. I had to dump out all the soap & fight for 30 minutes to get it back out. This dispenser made my morning very frustrating. I\u2019m hoping for at least an exchange for one that works. Maybe I\u2019m just unlucky & got a defective one\u2026 cause this seems to have all positive reviews which is why I chose this specific one. If I can exchange without hassle & the replacement works, I will change my review completely. Returning things for me is a huge hassle cause I live over 30 minutes away from any UPS drop off location, so I try to do as much research as I can before a purchase. This one had so many positive reviews that I thought I couldn\u2019t go wrong.UPDATE: Once I started the return process on the one of these that wouldn\u2019t work, the second one also quit working properly & wouldn\u2019t dispense soap. However, both of these were replaced by the company with no issues on the return process. The new ones do seem to be working much better. I also moved one of them higher on the wall than the first one I had installed which may have helped with the sensor a bit. I have had no further issues with these so far. I added stars back to my review due to the replacements & that the new ones are working much better.",

                "reviewText": "This was a surprisingly great purchase. Not only doesn't this thing look really high tech and fancy, but it also saves you a lot on soap. Recharging and refilling needs to happen every 3/4 months if you are a single person. You can use whatever soap you like. Just make sure if you are using standard soap like I am, to dilute it or it will screw up the internals. Also If you just installed it and it is not working make sure you dredge it. If you read the instructions, there is a cleaning/dredge mode you can use. I had to use it the first time I installed my unit. Motion detector and hand detection is fine, no issues. Though I do wish the screen would stay on longer after being triggered. This dispenser looks cool, will save you on soap, and is easy to use. Defiantly worth a buy if you're in the market for a new soap dispenser.",
