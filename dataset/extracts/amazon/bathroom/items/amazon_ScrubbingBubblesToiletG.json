                "reviewText": "The Scrubbing Bubbles Fresh Gel Toilet Bowl Cleaning Stamps Starter Pack has been a game-changer in my cleaning routine. It's incredibly effective, convenient, and leaves my bathroom smelling fresh.Originally, I was skeptical about these toilet cleaning stamps. I thought they might be a gimmick, but I decided to give them a try, and I'm so glad I did.The Rainshower scent is pleasant and not overpowering. Each stamp lasts for weeks, continuously cleaning and preventing limescale and toilet rings. The dispenser is easy to use, and the stamps adhere well to the toilet bowl, even under the rim.What's truly impressive is how well these stamps clean. Even stubborn stains are no match for them. I no longer need to spend extra time scrubbing the toilet bowl vigorously. Just drop a stamp in, and let it do the work.The starter pack comes with six stamps, so it lasts a long time, making it cost-effective. It's an excellent solution for keeping the toilet clean and fresh in between deep cleanings.Moreover, I have to thank my girlfriend for introducing me to these. She got them once to help keep my apartment fresh when she came over, and they are amazing. I love how small and simple they are, but they make a significant difference in maintaining a clean and inviting bathroom.In summary, the Scrubbing Bubbles Fresh Gel Toilet Bowl Cleaning Stamps have completely changed my perspective on toilet cleaning products. They're easy to use, effective, and long-lasting. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a hassle-free way to keep their bathroom fresh and clean.",

                "reviewText": "I ADORE these. Please let me set the record straight. MANY are complaining it all comes out , it is messy and that it is not 6 stamps but a blob ; all of which is Incorrect IF you actually read the Directions it DOES come out as 6 stamps. Do NOT push hard when applying the stamp the package tells you this. Several also report a chemical smell; personally I have never had a chemical smell ( 7 packs now used ) What I DO have is a pleasant, clean smell ( much like fresh linen, think of line hung ,sun dried sheets. ) I am SO Thankful I found these and plan to never be without them. Our most used bathroom is small, if we keep the door closed to it when not in use once you open the door to step inside it greets you with Clean, Fresh scent. I do not find it strong at all ( you might) my Mom has a very low smell tolerance and even she loves these. Let me share a tip as well; if you or a loved one uses a potty chair these can be a help; also stamp one inside your garbage can. They are great for a RV as well I even stamp them in the top of my Cats covered litter pan ( GO me ) . They DO NOT mean you do not have to clean your toilet ever... start with a clean toilet... these will help keep them clean; NOT clean them when they were already dirty/stained. SO End Results.. These do what they claim, They smell Lovely and make my Life EASIER. Spend the under 4.00 and give them a try; but READ THE DIRECTIONS. If this was Helpful Please give it a like/helpful rating. I rarely write a review but wanted to a set the record straight on how these really are and work.",
