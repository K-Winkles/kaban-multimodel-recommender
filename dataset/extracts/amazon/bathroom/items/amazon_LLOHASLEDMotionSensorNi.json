I like when I walk in the rooms at night, I don\u2019t have to turn on the switch for room lights, just let the night light come on. Convenient when I need to be in the rooms quickly. The lighting is perfect, doesn\u2019t blind my eyes when it turns on. I must say this 2 pack is great value for the price.",

Additionally, the light it puts out is nice and bright, but not so much that it blinds you as an overhead light would . I like these.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the features of this night light, particularly the motion detector feature. However, after a few weeks the motion sensor stopped working consistently; sometimes the light stays on all night instead of shutting off after 60 seconds of no motion detected. At that point, it becomes a regular night light. Sigh. That's why I gave it only 4 stars. I purchased it for the motion detection feature, which I expect to work consistently, but it doesn't.Other things I like: I like that it's a warm white color that has a lower setting so it's not too bright or harsh on the eyes at night. I use this as a bathroom night light. I also like the slim design; it doesn't take up a lot of space.Overall, I still recommend this nightlight despite the inconsistency of the motion detector. It's not expensive and still a decent night light.",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for a night light to both light the room but also be soft enough to not interrupt our new borns sleep. These have worked perfectly for us. The amber glow is soft enough to not wake him but full enough that we can still see well to assemble his bottles in the kitchen and to feed him. I especially appreciate the switch options on top. I usually set one to auto for the kitchen but the second I have set to always on for the bathroom so we can see well. The extra plus- these don\u2019t cover both outlets! My big gripe w night lights are they are so bulky and cover both outlets. These don\u2019t- small enough to not take up space but bright enough to be useful.",
