The adhesive truly holds, and the setup was quite simple! I adore how elegant it makes my bathroom look and how it assists in clearing out the clutter within my shower. Even with my frequent hot showers, the adhesive is still strong after several weeks of use. The enormous shampoo and conditioner bottles fit perfectly in the shower caddy's great capacity. The stainless steel shower caddy is impervious to rust. It's comforting to know that the product will maintain its smooth, beautiful appearance without developing unsightly rust.",

The installation was a breeze, and the adhesive has held up admirably so far \u2013 I've had them up for about a week now. I'll be sure to update if anything changes, but as of now, they're still securely in place!These caddies are proving their worth by holding substantial items with ease. One is carrying the large Dr. Bronner's soap bottle, and the other is effortlessly supporting a Dove sensitive skin bottle. The sturdy construction and reliable adhesive make these caddies a practical addition to any bathroom.In conclusion, if you're looking for shelf caddies that are not only easy to install but also deliver a robust hold, these are the ones to go for. Five stars for their performance and ability to support sizable items without any fuss!",

I bought them because I think my daughter collects shampoo and conditioner and we were out of room along the edges of the bathtub. These stick great- like really great! They are very cute, stylish, sturdy. They stick on super easy and look great! Thank you!",

I think the only thing to make these even better is to make a spot for a bar of soap. Soap can sit on these but the slats are wide so the soap can slip through if not placed perpendicular. Overall though, great quality- I will be buying another set for our second shower!",
