This affordable faucet has had no issues since I installed them in two bathrooms about 4 months ago. They look sleek and work just like the name brands. Have absolutely loved the new look of my bathrooms since changing out and updating/upgrading to these faucets. They even come with the matching black drain plug which you don\u2019t need to use plumbers putty with! I have no doubt these will hold up for a long time with daily use. Would buy again in a heartbeat.",

However there are some strange things- It has TOO much pressure- for a bathroom sink, it shoots out lots of water and when you wash your hands, the pressure shoots water everywhere so i have to just remember to only turn it on 25% or so.The pop up drain doesn't seem to have enough washers. It leaks despite having to use superman strength to get it to stop leaking. It shouldn't be that hard.The package does NOT come with Teflon tape, which just about every other sink has ever come with so i had to go buy that for the water shut offsSo in the end, it does the job but with flaws",
