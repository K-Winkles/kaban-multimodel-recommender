It removes the water drops on the glass shower door and tile with ease. The double sided tape used to mount the holder was easy to install and securely holds the squeegee in place. I also used an alcohol wipe to clean the tile before applying the adhesive tape. When placing the squeegee in the holder the rubber can be facing in or out. The squeegee is modern looking and functional. No more plastic squeegees in this house.",

                "reviewText": "This shower squeegee works very well. I have a LUXEAR Suction Cup Hook on my glass shower wall. I use the suction cup hook to hang up this shower squeegee.There are three sizes of Hiware All-Purpose Shower Squeegee Available: 10 inch, 12 inch, 14 inch. I purchased the 10 inch Shower Squeegee. I should have ordered the 12 or 14 inch to maximize the amount of surface area that the squeegee will clean.For now, I am happy with using a 10 inch Shower Squeegee. I\u2019m just happy to be able to use a shower squeegee. It\u2019s so satisfying to press this against the shower glass and to wipe all of the water off. It wipes off the water so cleanly. I wish there was a water squeegee exercise class (it would involve lots of squats and lunges, some stretching).Have a glass shower? Buy this squeegee (choose the larger size if in doubt) and a shower suction hook. Use together. It is a very practical purchase and you will never wake up regretting it.* LUXEAR Suction Cup Hooks, 2 Pack Shower Razor Holder Removable & Reusable Suction Hooks for Shower Wall ($9.99 for pack of 2) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083JV8615/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",
