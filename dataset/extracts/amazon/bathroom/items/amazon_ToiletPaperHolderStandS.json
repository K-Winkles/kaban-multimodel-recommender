                "reviewText": "I moved into a Pre-Mega roll era home and the existing TP holder was problematic. I don\u2019t know what the material is but it feels like super heavy foam board. It went together pretty easy except the little stops for the \u201chinged\u201d shelf and door. Those little things will drive you crazy. You are going to think they don\u2019t fit but with lots for pushing and wiggling they eventually go into place. There\u2019s no cover for the silver screws but a paint pen in titanium white made them less obnoxious. Another coat might cover them more. I added pictures of before and after. I bought this on a lightening deal so it\u2019s worth what I paid but had I paid full price I would have lost my mind. The door is not hinged nor is the top. They are just pegs in holes. I suspect they will eventually wear down and fail. It\u2019s not heavy duty so don\u2019t expect to put a plant or anything heavy on it. It does hold toilet paper and personal wipes. It also does accommodate a new mega roll of TP which was the whole purpose. I wouldn\u2019t buy another and I would be straight with a friend about the overall value but I\u2019m not mad at it.",

El \u00fanico detalles es que se me hace medio caro pero al final me hizo muy feliz el mueble.",
