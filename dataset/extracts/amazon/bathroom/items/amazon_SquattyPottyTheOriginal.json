To simulate a squatting position, all you have to do is take a seat, put your feet on the toilet stool, and get comfortable. Prefer the 7\" Height, but someone else in the home requires the 9\" Height? This Squatty Potty adjusts between both heights with just a flip. It's clever design requires very little effort to accommodate anyone's squatting needs. So simple. Yet so smart. Which size is right for me? The flip stool offers the best of both worlds. 7\u2033 Height is the most comfortable for most people. For those with comfort height toilets the 9\u2033 Height is sometimes preferred. Children also do better with the 9\u2033 Height.",

Putting it together was easy and it conveniently pushes under the front of the toilet when not in use. Works well and has improved bathroom time significantly. I would definitely buy again.",

It was easy to assemble and is the perfect height to serve its intended purpose.Can also double as a stool to help toddlers use the toilet independently.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a fan of the Original Squatty Potty Toilet Stool for years, and I wanted purchase more stools for additional toilets in my home. As much as I liked the Original's functionality, I thought it would look cheap to put a white plastic stool in guest bathrooms, so I did some research. I saw that Squatty Potty also develops a similar product, but instead of plastic, they use bamboo and call it the \"Bamboo Flip.\" This is because from a simple flip of the product, the stool can either be 7\" or 9\" tall from the ground. For typical toilets, a 7\" stool works, but if you have higher toilets (or children), the 9\" setting would be optimal.When the Bamboo Flip arrived, it came in a box with the necessary tools and hardware to personally assemble it. This called for 8 screws, screw covers, and rubber guards to protect your floors. Installation realistically took about 15-20 minutes to follow the instructions, make sure all of the pieces were in the correct location, and using the tools and hardware to put it all together. I purchased 3 of these stools, and one of them couldn't get assembled properly due to warping of the wood. Keep this in mind! If you assemble your stool, and you see any pieces of wood bending or not fitting together properly, contact Amazon as soon as possible for an exchange or a refund.Overall, the Bamboo Flip from Squatty Potty looks a lot better than the Original Squatty Potty with its cheap white plastic look. It has a lot less surface area for your feet compared to the Original, so keep this in mind. There is also a slight decline on the surface of the stool where your feet sit compared to the flat surface of the Original. I personally like this product, and I would recommend all humans to have some sort of stool in their bathrooms going forward! The Bamboo Flip is less of an eye-sore compared to the Original for guests, but both of them do their jobs well.",
