When it was packaged it was handled with care and not just thrown into a box. They carefully wrap it to ensure it doesn\u2019t get broke during shipment.2. The scent is more of a natural scent and not overwhelming. So it makes you feel like you\u2019re actually at the place of where that scent would be. If that makes sense haha. It\u2019s a very comforting smell.3. It adds a beautiful touch to wherever you place it. It\u2019s definitely an eye catcher in a good way!It is just amazing.",

The one I have purchased is with a single fake rose with a green sprig. I like this one much better than the baby's breath. It's easier to put in the jar after putting in ALL of the reeds. The fragrance is pleasant but does smell more like roses than a combination of rose and sandlewood. Which I am happy with. I think it smells beautiful. I've bought another which is the one with baby's breath and have one in my cart to buy on payday. I really do like the aroma and people that visit always compliment on how good it smells. I have two in my bedroom. Average size room and one on each side of the room. You do have to flip the reeds regularly so that the aroma continues. I bought this on sale and I think it is most definitely worth the cost.",

But I\u2019ve had mine in my bathroom for almost 3 days now and I can\u2019t smell it at all. That\u2019s after letting it soak overnight & flipping them over. I haven\u2019t opened the other one yet, but I am a little disappointed in the one I did open. I have 3 boys using a bathroom so I wanted something that would last a little longer than the Febreze plug ins, but it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen with these, unfortunately! It\u2019s just me & my husband using the master bath so I feel like for the scent being so strong, it should be working in there. It\u2019s possible it\u2019s just a dud or something, but unlikely.",

The smell from this one is not that strong but I can smell it when sitting at my desk. I probably will order a different scent to try after this one because it is cuteUpdate- after a few days the scent is definitely more noticeable when walking in the room. I am going to order another one to boost it more",
