                "reviewText": "Yeah, I read the reviews before I bought this and did see that the suction cups were an issue. I also saw, though, a lot of people saying that for them it suctioned great, and little tips like making sure the tub is a little bit wet to help the cups grip better, so I figured I'd try it. And yeah, it doesn't stick in the slightest lol \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 It's not too much of a nuisance! Generally I just have to fix it before I get in and it'll mostly stay in place from me stepping/walking on it. Other than that, it is a great mat! Good size, not transparent at all, the holes are nice so water and soap doesn't pool up in it too bad. Sometimes some suds do stay in the middle a little bit, but as long as you rinse the mat after your shower, you should be fine!",

                "reviewText": "To get the suction cups to grip great just wet down the tub floor first. Lay it out and walk down the length of it slowly with feet close together, walk across the entire mat trying to hit all the suction cups. This thing doesn\u2019t budge, feels great on the feet too. We threw our old one away after having it for about six years. We tried a different kind & brand that had a textured top like rocks still made of rubber, but it was painful. We went back to this one, and are very happy with it. There is a smell when you first open it kind of like when you buy a new pool or pool accessories that you have to inflate. The smell does go away I didn\u2019t notice it after a few days of use. This is literally brand new, so there is going to be a smell to it. It just has to be aired out. This is normal for any new silicone or rubber based product from a factory. Just like when you buy a brand new mattress, it may have some smells that need to off gas because of the materials used. If you buy a super cheap mat, that\u2019s not gonna last long it may not have any smell, but it\u2019s not gonna work is good either. This is a great product and I\u2019m going to buy a third one as a back up to this one in case they ever stop selling it. They last a super long time. The only reason I had to throw my old one away was because I was really bad about cleaning underneath it. I bought it in white and over the years. It had changed color so I went with the light seafoam kind of green color this time and it\u2019s beautiful in my bathroom. I would recommend this product, but definitely don\u2019t expect to use it and have it stick if you put it on dry and then take a shower of course it\u2019s going to slip around. Like any good suction cup it should have a little bit of moisture behind it to help it adhere fully.",

The top is grippy so our child doesn't slip as much when he ultimately stands in the tub. Highly highly recommend, plus it is kinda plush so it has a nice feel when they do fall.",
