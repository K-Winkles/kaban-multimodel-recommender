                "reviewText": "I bought several of these to migrate data from older drives. I've also bought at least a couple dozen other external Western Digital hard drives from their various product lines: My Book, Easy Book, etc... These are/were generally a good deal (when I bought them in mid-2022) at just under $250 for 14 TB (about 12.7 formatted capacity). That's less that $18 per Terabyte, which is a decent value, and a LOT cheaper than what you'd pay for most ANY internal 3.5\" bare hard drive (which tend to be a lot pricier per TB, though most manufacturers put fairly cheap/light duty cycle drives in their externals). They're fine for light/normal use, long-term archiving of data, etc... but if you're going to need a heavy-use storage device and just run it 24hrs/day for months or years, you should get a more durable/expensive drive.Pros: fairly reliable (I've only had a couple of these go bad ever), good value, simple shiny black caseCons: IME, tech support from WD is not great if you need it, being over 5-6TB these drives require an AC adapter for power... smaller drives can get power from USBI've bought them before, and I'll probably buy more of them in the future.",
