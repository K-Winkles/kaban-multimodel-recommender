Do not listen to them. They do not understand that this is NOT an SSD, it is an enterprise class SATA mechanical hard drive in a TB3 case. The bottleneck here is the mechanical hard drive. There are people complaining that this is not a \"40gb capable drive\". This is laughable pure ignorance of the technology and what they purchased. The mechanical hard drive inside is NOWHERE near capable of 40gb speeds. If you need huge mass storage the G-Drive PRO is an excellent drive. If you need the absolute fastest speeds then you should buy the SSD version. Just do your research to understand the technology you are buying.",

But I needed more space and this drive comes a bit closer to Mac's internal Apple's SSD, and am happy with it.
