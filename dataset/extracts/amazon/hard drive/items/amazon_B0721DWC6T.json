Rather than thickness and sheerness (what the heck?) it should be rated on what matters: this is a solid case that is a great fit. The built in handle is much stronger than would ever be needed. There is ample storage for the USB cable and power adapter without unnecessary bulk. I had stored my My Book in a plastic kitchen storage box for years, but was always a little concerned with static and secondary impact. This case is great and confidence inspiring. Highly recommended n",
