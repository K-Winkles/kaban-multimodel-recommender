                "reviewText": "To date I have used THREE of the FIVE Thumb Drives on TWO laptops. I used one on my laptop by doing a full back-up. Everything went quite smoothly, no different from any other thumb drive I've used. I gave one to wife to perform a back-up on her laptop. No problems for her either.Every two weeks or so my wife and I updated the thumb drive for our laptops for six weeks. The other day I was adding files to update the thumb drive for my laptop. During the update, I saw an error that stated the file could not be added because the file name was too long. I then noticed an error that stated the drive was not ejected properly. I had not touched anything so I removed the thumb drive and re-inserted it into the laptop. Nothing happened. The thumb drive didn't appear anywhere on the laptop. I tried the thumb drive on my wife's laptop, but it didn't work there either.I tried one of the remaining three drives and found that it was \"seen\" by the laptop. I copied a few files to the third drive with success and then did a full back-up.Sadly the original Thumb Drive I used to back-up my laptop no longer works. This is the first time a thumb drive from any manufacturer has failed. I'll be sure to have two back-ups, one father and one grandfather, for each of our laptops going forward which is good practice anyway.I would have given five stars for all categories, but a current fail of thirty-three percent doesn't not qualify for five stars.",

It's big enough to hold a few versions of the Linux kernel and a few support tools, and that's all I needed them for. Write speed is pretty slow. Read speed is medium. They have a nice form factor / size and the LED that lights up when connected helps confirm you seated it properly.",
