                "reviewText": "I've been using this drive (4TB X300) for about 7 months now. It's speedy for a hard drive, enough that other than when it needs to spin back up from sleep, I don't feel the comparatively slower speeds in most uses, although I primarily use it for data storage and save gaming/applications for SSDs. It can be a little noisy in use but it's silent at idle, which is where it spends most of its time. CMR is a huge plus and I'm glad Toshiba not only offers that, but advertises it as well, so you don't have to hunt spec sheets (or user-reported specs!). The price is imo competitive, with CMR, 256MB cache, and 7200 RPM. Similar capacity drives can be had for less but will perform slower and less reliably.",

Since I'm using a nine year-old Linux box, can't get full rated performance out of the drive but it is fast enough for my uses (with one exception). On standard Ext4 Partitions, I get very decent read and write speeds, around half of the rated spd for the drive. Running LUKS encrypted Partitions, however, write speed is painfully slow. I suspect this is mainly due to issues with the operating system (Debian) and the older computer hardware not handling file transfers well on the encrypted drive.",

It's fast enough for most games, reasonably priced, and fairly quiet as well. It seems some folks have gotten HDD's that have been returned or were of a different line of Toshiba HDD's, but I am happy to report my model numbers matched the box and my friend who is a very avid gamer has had no complaints.

                "reviewText": "There is something really fishy going on with the drive I bought. It has some sort of terrible APM (power saving features) enabled on a hardware level, which absolutely cripple the performance. I believed Toshiba is either reselling eco drives as gaming drives (very shady) or these drives just have terrible power saving tech integrated, which makes them COMPLETELY unusable for gaming. The drive constantly freezes for several milliseconds while some sort of head parking / spindown operation happens. During games that stream data from the disk (many games) the game will freeze for several frames every 3-5 seconds. Obviously this is unusable. The APM features can be mostly disabled with software, but it is only temporary, and resets when the computer goes to sleep or is restarted. It also doesn't completely disable the APM features, so occasional freezing will still happen at really frustrating moments. I'm guessing one of three things is going on:1. The drives have \"eco\" tech or \"green\" tech that is not advertised in the product listing, despite the drive being labelled as \"high performance\" and ready for pc gaming. (very shady)2. I received a different eco / green type drive that was relabeled and re-sold as a high performance / gaming drive. (fraudulent)3. I received a counterfeit drive (least likely, but maybe possible)I'm surprised I haven't seen more people complaining about the APM features, I'm guessing a lot of people just use this for mass storage and not for gaming. As a pure mass storage drive, it is okay, but unbelievably loud, easily the loudest drive I've ever seen. I replaced it with a WD Black which is almost silent in comparison. Needless to say, DO NOT buy this Toshiba drive for gaming. I spent $190 for this and now I'm stuck with a completely useless for gaming hard drive. If you buy one, test it thoroughly before the return window closes. Unfortunately it is really hard to test for APM features, because it will not become obvious during normal benchmarks, and only becomes visible during specific games or workloads.",
