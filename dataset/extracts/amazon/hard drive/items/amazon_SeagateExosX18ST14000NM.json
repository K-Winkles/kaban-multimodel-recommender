Tried on 3 different computers and none of them recognized it. So I filed for a return with Amazon and dropped it off at my local Staples that handles Amazon returns.Over the years I have bought a lot of hard drives from Amazon and other places and this was the first DOA.Figuring the odds of another DOA were very small I placed another order for the same Seagate Exos 14 tb model. It arrived the next day and is up and running with no problems. Exos drives are designed as Enterprise level drives with great performance and a long MTBF. So far none of the Exos drives I've purchased over the years have given any problems other than this one DOA. Hard Disk Sentinel tests rate it as excellent for both performance and health.Amazon issued a credit to my card shortly after I dropped off the first drive. The entire return process was quite quick and convenient.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I forgot to add that I purchased this as Amazon as the Seller, not a 3rd party, and when I checked the warranty on the Seagate site it was for 5 years.I have two Hitachi 2TB hard drives that have been working without problem for about 7 years (7200RPM). One drive has Win 7, Vista and XP on it, and the other drive is for Data (my main Win 10 boot drive is on SSD). But since I sometimes have to use Win 7, and these drives are a bit old, I was looking to replace them with new faster hard drives.I decided to try the Seagate Barracuda 2TB first since it was a low price. I was impressed that it is a single platter with two heads inside and is quiet. Also, when I first did some benchmarking with Crystal it showed over 200MB/s Read and Write. But if I ran it again, the numbers were not consistent and would be as low as 35MB/s. Using HD Tune showed that this drive has major drops in speed across the platter. I cloned my Win 7 over to it, ana it took about 4 minutes to fully boot, no faster than the old Hitachi. The 2 year warranty is also a concern. So I can't really recommend this drive as a OS drive, but would be OK as a backup drive or just a data drive if you don't need fast performance.I have also since then tried this WD Gold 2TB (good performance, but loud disk spinning sound and loud read/write clicks), the Seagate Exos 7E2 and newer Exos 7E8). The WD Gold was the Loudest drive out of the bunch, as I could hear the disk spinning (motor) and loud clicks when read/write. The Exos 7E2 wasn't as loud as the WD Gold. The best drive was this Exos 7E8 at $150. It was actually the quietest drive out of all, and also the fastest with speeds up to 240-250MBs, also has 5 year warranty that I verified on the Seagate site. When I cloned my Win 7 over to it, the boot time was 1min 45 sec, and remember the Barracuda was 4 minutes. So that right there shows the Exos 7E8 is faster for an OS drive.So out of the 2TB Drives that I tired, Seagate Barracuda, WD Gold, Seagate Exos 7E2 and Exos 7E8, the beat for an OS drive was the Exos 7E8 due to the fastest speed and it also being quieter than the rest.",

                "reviewText": "So I don\u2019t write too many reviews, but I wanted to put this together for people who are as confused as I was about whether or not these drives are loud.Before I settled on these, I read tons of reviews on Newegg and Amazon and it seemed like a pretty even split between people who think these drives are horrendously loud, and people who think they are silent as the grave.The short answer seems to be, they are both.The key is how they\u2019re being used.In my experience, these drives are silent until a couple of seconds into a large data transfer. After that, they start to make some noise, and it is significant. I wouldn\u2019t want to listen to it for a long time. However, in my use case, (a personal home media server that only I use) I never reach the maximum speed of the drives (around 250mb per second) unless I am transferring whole shows onto the drive, or exporting them to an external device, and in that case, the transfers do not last long. Also, I am not seated next to the computer when tranferring large files so the sound is quieter from a short distance.My advice when purchasing these drives is to think about your use case. Mainly, how often will you need to move files that are bigger than just a couple gigabytes? Because that is when the louder, more concerning noises will occur.Also, consider setting up your pc so that the drives never disengage or \u201cspin down\u201d once the pc is on. There is a delay of several seconds before you can access files and a lot of noise when the drives first spin up before they settle into silent operation. (Personally, I like the sound they make when they spin up, but I wouldn\u2019t want them doing that all the time. It\u2019s bad for them. ((I know that is contested, but I\u2019m saying it anyway, since I think the people on the other side of that argument are wrong.))",

                "reviewText": "The best thing about this product is the 5 year warranty. I have 8 of these 14TB drives and after a year, two have completely failed. I mean failed to the point where data on that drive is not recoverable. If you plan on using these drives make sure to have some sort of redundancy or backup. Whatever is commonly failing on these drives is not something where you will be warned or have time to backup, they just die immediately.Seagate makes it really easy to register the drives and see all your products on one page, and getting a replacement takes one click of a button and you can choose the free option (send in your drive then they mail you the replacement) or a premium replacement option where they overnight you a drive for $20 then you send yours in.This is the best part about the product, I invested in these drives because I know I'm guaranteed at least 5 years where I don't have to purchase a brand new drive.The reliability however is questionable, so I took a star off since you heavily rely on replacing these drives so often via warranty.",
