                "reviewText": "I bought three of these Crucial MX500 4TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5 Inch Internal SSD drives to install in a recently acquired HP Core i7 desktop. My goal is to eventually phase out a full tower PC that I built in 2012. It handles my video and audio servers and has a solid state boot drive, along with 7 spinning hard drives for data.This HP has a considerably smaller case and my goal was to fill it with high capacity SSD drives. I've always been a fan of the Crucial line of SSD drives, and I've never had one go bad. All three of these Crucial 4 tb drives were installed to SATA headers on the motherboard, and I was able to fit all of them in what is a one foot tall mini desktop tower.Installing these drives is very easy, plug in a sata cable plus a power cable to each, and they're good to go. I used 3m two sided tape, the kind used to hang pictures, to stick the drives to flat surfaces inside the case. They are very light and compact, I just made sure to keep some air around each drive and not bunch them together.Once they were installed, I closed up the case and turned on the computer. I opened disk manager and partitioned and formatted each of the new drives. They will be used as data drives. The computer came with a 1TB M.2 as the boot drive, so the total solid state drive capacity for the computer is 13 TB.I spent some time copying my audio database of over one thousand CD's ripped into lossless format files, as well as my video database of movies and music videos.My 2012 build full tower with it's spinning hard drives holding the data, worked well for many years. This new one with all ssd drives, works much better. Each audio or video file loads noticeably faster than on the old server, plus there are no spinning hard drives making noise.I downloaded the \"Crucial Storage Executive\" software from the Crucial website that is very helpful. It checks the firmware revision you have and updates it if needed. All three of mine came with the \"45' version of the firmware. I had it update to the latest \"46\" version which took less than 30 seconds.The photo with this review shows my new media server loaded with 13 tb of solid state drive capacity, including three of the Crucial SATA ssd's. They are fast, cool running and should have a very long life.",

                "reviewText": "Within Sata SSDs this specific Crucial SSD is rated highly for its speed and reliability. And it just feels snappy. I have this added into my system for additional storage since all my nvme lanes on the motherboard are occupied. 2tbs is pretty generous for an extra media drive, and specifically for games prior to this current generation of console work extremely well. Particularly \u201ce-sports\u201d titles that seem to be getting bloated in file size these days.You could even use this as a scratch drive for video editing if you wanted to as well. Got this on a sale during Black Friday here and it was well worth the money I spent. Even when I upgrade my PC onto a new Platform (I\u2019m still on AM4 rocking a 5800X3D currently) I can just recycle this drive for use on a secondary \u201cback-up\u201d system with its total capacity.While Sata SSDs might eventually become a relic of the past for now they\u2019re still really good if you can get them on a deal and all your nvme slots are full.",
