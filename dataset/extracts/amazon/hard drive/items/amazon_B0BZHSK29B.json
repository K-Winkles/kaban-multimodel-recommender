Highly Compatible Interface The D6-320 USB storage comes with a 1-meter USB Type-C to Type-C cable and is plug-and-play, requiring no drivers. It is compatible with a range of computer interfaces, including USB 3.0/3.1/3.2, Thunderbolt 3/4. Hot Swappable, Intelligent Disk Sleep The D6-320 HDD storage allows hot swapping for convenient hard disk replacement while powered on. It supports the sleep function to reduce power consumption and extend the hard disk's service life by following the computer OS's sleep mode. Better Heat Dissipation The D6-320 HDD enclosure features a temperature-controlled fan that adjusts its speed according to the hard disk's temperature for optimal performance. Its internal structure is optimized to increase air pressure, reduce hard disk temperature, and minimize noise and resonance. These features enable the D6-320 to operate quietly even under heavy load. Expansion of NAS Storage Space The D6-320 DAS storage is compatible with TerraMaster NAS via USB interface with proper adaptation. Users can expand the NAS storage space by creating arrays and storage pools on D6-320 through TerraMaster TOS. Note: this feature requires TerraMaster NAS with TOS 5.1 or later version.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good! Works right out of the box. Does not use any proprietary file system or encryption.",
                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I've only used this for two days.I was hesitant to get this at first. I saw on another brand (QNAP) that it stated \"The files and data stored on drives moved to/from a NAS (or another device) will not be recognized.\" and I wasn't sure if that was specific to them or if it was that way all around. For my purposes, I wanted my drive to be able to be read in pretty much any system. If this broke or was damaged or stopped working, I wanted to be able to put my drives into something else and be able to read them - I didn't want the data to be only able to be read in this box.And this was the case! I have plugged three hard disks in, each one containing data, and it read each of them just fine.Plugging disks is as simple as popping them in the tray, popping the two plastic side pieces in (no screws needed, though you could use them instead of the plastic side pieces, if desired), and pushing it in the bay. That's it.Disks go in easy enough, but they are latched in there, and though they are easy enough to unlatch, they are firm enough that I don't see it possible to \"accidentally\" unlatch them.The bays are numbered 1-4 on the bottom. My suggestion is to name the enclosure (BackUp, Media, etc.) and then name each drive after their position in the enclosure (Backup_1 or Media_3) etc. This way you can easily tell in Explorer which drive is which, if you were wanting to remove one.I actually ordered a second one. The first one will be used as my primary storage device, plugged into my router (it has a USB port for an external drive). The second will be used as a backup of that.I currently have a variety of drives in it - from a new 18TB to a smaller 8TB, to a really tiny and old 500GB drive I had laying around. It read all of them just fine. The 500GB had much slower write speeds, obviously, but the two larger (and newer) drives were capable of 100-200MB/S speeds.I am very happy with this and I'm glad I bought it.I think I would have liked the option to be able to turn individual drives off, but it's not that big of a deal. So far that's my only complaint, and it's not really much of a complaint!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Use with Plex Server",
                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these to be used with a Plex server running on a Mac Mini, one for the main server and one for offsite backup. I populated both of them with WD RED NAS drives and everything is working great. I am getting around 200 mb/s per second on each drive. Considering the WD website says that the drives are rated at 180 mb/s, these speeds are better than I had hoped.It was extremely easy to setup as well and the Mac recognized the device without any drivers needed. I popped in the first hard drive and named/formatted. Once done I did the next. I did this for all four drives. I just popped in the next drive while the device was still on. I did this so that the drive names on the main server and backup would not only be the same, but in the same spot in the device. I am not sure how you would know which drive was in which slot if you simply threw all the drives in and plugged it in. This approach would be fine for most people, but I need the backup setup the same as the main so I can swap drives when necessary.My experience so far has been great. Drives showed up instantly, no issues with naming/formatting, speeds are where they should be, and no fussing with drivers/software. The drives also seem to sleep while not in use, which I like from a power saving perspective. This is a 24/7 server and having the drives go to sleep is an added benefit if they are not in use. I have had no issues with them waking up as soon as needed.The device is mostly silent. You can hear a slight noise when the fans kick on, but no complaints on the sound. The build quality is nice as the device is made of metal, except that the trays that hold the drives are plastic. Would have been nice if these were metal, but if pushed in properly they should hold up fine. The box also came with stickers for labeling the drives and additional feet in case they come off. This isn't a big deal, but I found it to be an extra nicety.",

                "reviewText": "This is plugged into a thunderbolt 3 port on Windows machine. Initial impressions are that it works as advertised (with the exception of the tray light issue noted below. I was able to set up a Storage Spaces array in Windows so software JBOD and raid does seem to be an option. I'm able to max out individual drives without issue, including 500MB SSD and have seen in the 700's for multiple drive copies.Also, note that if you are going to use SSD's, you could have a problem if there is a firmware update as you can't do it in the dock, you have to be connected to sata. At least that was the case for my Samsung SSD using their Magician software.Instructions weren't included and the web link it provided took you to some partial instructions that you scroll sideways through and not the actual instruction manual which was more complete.Final notable issue is that my unit had 4 of the 6 docks that did not show the status and activity lights. Took me a while of trouble shooting to figure out what was going on. Turns out that the backplane, where the lights come from, was working fine. The issue was the plastic channel that tunnels the light from the back to the front was opaque on 4 docks. Shining a flashlight on the back wouldn't even light up the front on the back ones (but would shine brightly on the two that were good). Contacted Terramaster about the issue and they said they will send replacements.",

This is a perfect solution for having a way to access older internal harddrives at the push of a button. Combine this with other USB hubs with buttons and you can keep all of your drives off until you need them. It saves their life span and it is less work on your pc for those of us who have over 15 terabytes of stored data.",
