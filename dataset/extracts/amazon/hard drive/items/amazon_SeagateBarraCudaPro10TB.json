                "reviewText": "From the moment I plugged it in, this drive has been a dream, 10TB of storage is a lot and I don't plan on needing any more storage for the many years to come. It's also a really fast drive too considering the fact that this is a HDD and not an SSD. I've had no noise issues which I was slightly worried about since the mounting holes on this drive only let me screw in 2 screws into this drive using the mounting system in my rosewill blackhawk ultra case, but it is running very well. It's a pretty penny to pay, but from my experiences with this drive, it's entirely worth it if you have any need for this much storage. Heat has also simply not been an issue with me on this drive too in case anyone was wondering. I will update if anything changes.Update 3/28/2017: After using it for almost a solid month for gaming, I can confirm that the drive is still running amazingly :)",

This drive has been great and dependable for all this time, so why not.The new one got here a few days ago. Sealed in it's packaging, but somehow has small dents on the outer shell. The packaging was fine, so it appears to have happened during manufacturing. I'm not sure if it's going to effect anything internally as I haven't tested yet, but I do want to warn you of the potential manufacturing issues. I've removed one star for this. I'll be completing my NAS build this weekend, and then I'll know if it's functional or not. If it's not, I'll be returning it, and I'll update this review.

Arrivato con 2gg di ritardo rispetto ai 5gg previsti, con spedizione tracciabile. Imballaggio appena sufficiente: due scatole di cui quella contenente l'hard disk era avvolta da un misero foglietto di pluriball che non le impediva di scivolare all'interno della scatola pi\u00f9 grande. Per quanto riguarda il montaggio, lateralmente ci sono solo due fori filettati per lato. Al momento funziona contemporaneamente con altri 2 dischi, di cui uno gemello comperato nel 2021 e non mi sembra che il rumore sia lievitato in maniera percepibile rispetto a prima. Quanto all'affidabilit\u00e0, finora anche questo modello sembra funzionare bene, cos\u00ec come hanno fatto i modelli Seagate precedentemente da me acquistati.",

Speedwise it's ok for gaming although it's not as fast as a hybrid or SSD. But none of that matters because this is the noisiest HD you'll ever own! Its constantly shuddering and spinning in an annoying and incredibly loud way. It sounds like you're 80 year old grandma is trying scratch on a turntable, but nana is terrible at it. From what I've read online there's nothing that can be done about this. If you have your PC under your desk maybe it wont bother you as much, but if it's on your desk it'll drive you nuts. Because of this I can only give this drive 1 star!",
