Old hopper was 21% full took me 3 days to transfer the recordings at my leisure of course was in no hurry. When I first hooked it up according to the directions provided it did not show up or recognized by the hopper unit,used the e sata cable that was provided. I then unplugged it from surge protector then the power switch on back of unit disconnected the e says then used the USB cable plugged it back in flipped the power switch within 5 sec it was recognized and the hopper was ready to re format it. Just as easy to transfer recordings back to new hopper. Very chuffed with this little unit which btw seems to be built like a sh-- brick house a little heavy and nice aluminum outer case.",

The fandom appears to be much better quality and faster. It is a Seagate. The one Dish sells was a western. This one is also cheaper than one sold by dish. Can buy service to retrieve data if drive fails. Consider this, when my Dish hard drive failed I lost all movies on disk. Plug and play works great. Comes with own power supply so if U check Dish requirements for external hard Drive this qualifies. Comes with USB 3. works with USB 2.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the 2TB FD external hard drive for about two weeks and so far it works great!! It comes with instructions specifically for setting it up for Dish network products. I just followed the instructions exactly as written and have had NO problems. I have the older Dish w/Sling DVR and the External Hard Drive works great with my Hopper DVR. One important thing I did not know is that you do not have to transfer recordings back to you DVR in order to watch them. Simply go the External Hard Drive using your Dish remote, select a movie and play!!Lastly, if you are current Dish customer and have a Hopper DVR, then there is NO additional fee for this 2TB FD External Hard Drive. I called Dish and spoke with customer support just to be sure about it. Adding additional external storage is FREE.",

                "reviewText": "Seems solid. And Quiet. I really wanted this to work with my DISH Wally system in the RV. But it took a couple of weeks to get the DISH system working since the RV was stored in a place where I could not get the signal. I spent about 4 hours over 3 days with DISH tech support who walked me through reset of the system at least a dozen times. But the system will not recognize it. A now it's beyond the date when it could be returned to Amazon I thought I'd try a different disk, inexpensive Seagate from Costco. Worked the first time, and didn't need that extra power supply. Windows also does not recognize the drive. I think I have a boat anchor. Hard to recommend this one.",

                "reviewText": "I have found Fantom to have some of the the most reliable drives that I have used. My oldest drive is a Fantom and it is still going strong while I have had others brands fail.. This Fantom Drive works great with my Dish Hopper 3. I plugged it in, turned it on, and the Hopper asked to format. It went through the format and the Hopper notified it was ready. The Hopper recognizes the drive as another playable source. You can transfer items from the Hopper 3 to this drive to open space on the Hopper 3. To play you hit additional sources on the new icon that displays after installing the drive and adding programs to the drive. The down side is when you are traveling you cannot access the add-on drive through the Dish Anywhere app. After speaking with a technical agent at Dish, I was advised that this may become an option in the near future. Other than that the playback is flawless. I would recommend especially if your Hopper 3 is getting pretty heavily loaded. The transfer from the Hopper 3 to the drive is pretty quick. Just a 2-3 minutes for a 1 hour HD show. The Hopper 3 has a USB 3.0 and a USB 2.0 receptacle in the back. I plugged this drive into the 3.0 as this drive is USB 3.0.",

                "reviewText": "I only write reviews if I have an exceptional experience or a terrible one. This falls in the category of the exceptional experience.I am using this with a DISH Hopper 3 with Sling. The setup was very easy. All I had to do was connect the USB cord to the DVR and this external drive, then restart my DVR. As soon as the DVR restarted, a setup guide appeared. No adapters or anything else is required other than what is in the box (USB and eSATA cables along with a stand). My DVR required the USB connection.All one has to do is format the friend and you are ready to go. The storage space is massive and the external drive is so quiet, it is barely heard. It is so easy to transfer files between the DVR and this external drive. Even the sort settings remain intact from the DVR to this drive.This is a must have if you want to expand your storage space. I plan to purchase one for use with my Windows desktop after seeing the performance with this product with my DVR.",
