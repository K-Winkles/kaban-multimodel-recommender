                "reviewText": "I bought this for a remote backup of my Linux file server. Luckily it doesn't have to be used only on the XBox. The one I received contains a Segate ST12000NM0127 12TB (base10 math) Enterprise SATA-6Gbps HDD. I can't say they use the same model in every enclosure, so the rest of my review only applies if you receive the same model drive inside the enclosure.SMART data says it's new, but I suspect it's a refurb as most on the market at this price range are refurbs. Basically you are getting a free enclosure by buying this.The drive inside supports self-encryption, but sedutil doesn't manage it as well as opal so I just used luks, but at least the self-encryption does speed up secure \"erasure\" via hdparm should you ever need it just like with an ssd (it just writes over the key so the data is useless). Formatted as luks then btrfs I get about 10.9TiB (base2 math) of usable space. Speeds are about what you expect for a spinner enterprise drive. Nothing to complain about. Saved me trying to find an enclosure with a separate drive at least.",
