                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Type-C USB Flash Drive, and I am impressed with its performance and features.**Speed Demon:**This little blue wonder lives up to its promise of lightning-fast data transfers. The up to 400MB/s read speeds make it an absolute game-changer for anyone who values their time. Note that the write speeds are significantly slower.**Universal Compatibility:**I appreciate the USB type-c compatibility, making it future-proof and ensuring seamless connections with modern devices. The backward compatibility with USB 3.0/2.0 ensures it works with a wide range of devices.**Waterproof Marvel:**Accidents happen, but with this drive, I know my data is safe, come rain or shine. It's a relief to have a tech device that can weather the storm.**Generous Storage:**With 256GB of storage, this flash drive is a portable powerhouse. Whether it's documents, photos, or backups, there's ample space to accommodate my needs without constantly worrying about running out of room.**Sturdy Build:**The build quality is top-notch. It feels sturdy in hand, and the robust construction gives me confidence that it can withstand the rigors of daily use.**Sleek Design:**The sleek blue design is not just about aesthetics; it also makes the drive easy to spot in a cluttered bag. The retractable design protects the USB connector when not in use, adding an extra layer of durability. One thing to note is it does not fit through my Lamicall protective case. I purchased an extender to make it fit.In conclusion, the SAMSUNG Type-C USB Flash Drive is a stellar combination of speed, reliability, and durability. If you're in need of a high-performance flash drive that doesn't compromise on design and comes with the added bonus of being waterproof, look no further. This is a must-have gadget for anyone who values efficiency and peace of mind in their digital life!",

                "reviewText": "This is the Samsung brand we all have grown to love with their jaw-dropping TVs and must-have cutting-edge Galaxy line phones. Samsung has been the number 1 brand in flash drives since 2003. You can count on your priceless pictures transferring with zero errors or corrupt files.Honestly, the price of these Samsung flash drives is cheap. The quality, reliability, and performance are what make Samsung. I bought two of these.They are so easy to use. They have a unmount option you select when you want to unplug the flash drive and just plug it back in when you want to use it. They work on phones, tablets, cameras, desktops, laptops, and Im sure other devices.It's magnet, x-ray, water, heat & and cold, and impact-proof. It's pretty much indestructible unless you're going to blow it up or shoot it with a gun. I seriously doubt you'll be doing any of that but if you do, invite me I'm free.I'm sure another brand has one faster or holds more pictures. But do they have two decades of being the world's number 1 brand? Nope, they sure don't. So do yourself a favor and buy a couple of these and back up your pictures. You know the ones that can't be replaced. This flash drive will accept 4K video as well.Oh, and I almost forgot. The look of it is pretty cool too. It fits between your fingers nicely and it's very very easy to use. And its small enough to fit on your key chain or even a neckless.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Type-C\u2122 USB Flash Drive (256GB) and I'm thrilled with its performance. Transferring 4GB files in just 11 seconds is impressive, thanks to its blazing fast read speeds of up to 400MB/s. The compatibility with USB 3.0/2.0 is a convenient feature, and the waterproof design adds an extra layer of durability. The sleek blue color and the ample storage capacity make it a reliable choice for my data needs. Overall, a solid investment for anyone in need of a high-speed, reliable USB flash drive.",
