                "reviewText": "I bought this product because I ran out of space on my IPhone, and could no longer take any more photos. This was a problem that needed to be fixed and the other alternative would\u2019ve been paying for more storage monthly, and I decided that I did not want to spend money every month just to keep my photos on my phone, and that I would prefer to keep my photos on a flash drive anyways to keep my photos in a safe place where I could access them any time. This product was a solution to my problem, and it was so simple to use! All you have to do is download an app on your phone to transfer the photos to the flash drive and you just insert the flash drive right into your phone. It was very easy and now I can transfer photos whenever I want and if I ever want to look back on the photos I downloaded all I have to do is insert it back in my phone or use the opposite side of the flash drive and insert it into a USB plug, like on a computer. I definitely would recommend this for everyone even if you don\u2019t need to free up the space, because it is so nice to have your photos in a safe place!",

                "reviewText": "Thank you for such an excellent design & hi quality storage product!Has 4 different connecters which slide out from either end of main thumb drive ( iPhone connector at one end and at other end a USB connector which can be partially flipped down to expose a microUSB inside of the USB end...also another Android TypeC connector mini adaptor is included which connects to USB end! So there are definitely 4 different connectors included when you use the flip down feature on USB end ). Great price point for a tiny thumb drive size Flash Drive with 512GB and 4 connectors: Android TypeC+iPhone+MicroUSB+USB. Remember it has to be flipped down gently/carefully from the top of USB side where you'll see 2 square holes to access that extra connector... good design works well, just gently tug it from top down so it flips out to expose the microUSB connector.Again, it has over 500 GB of memory ( you read that right! Half a TB! ), incredible for such a small size & solidly designed product!!Perfect for all Social Media, photos, videos, docs, projects, files & backup your life!Will definitely order again. Happy & Amazed!",
