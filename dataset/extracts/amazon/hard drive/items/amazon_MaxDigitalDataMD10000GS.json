After evacuating the data off the NAS, which is a two drive model, then adding these drives, rebuilding the array and restoring the data, these work well. The drives had zero hours on them from SMART, and the NAS appliance I used them with was easily able to work with them in a RAID 1 configuration. So far, they have been in constant use after purchase, and definitely no complaints, errors or other glitches. Definitely will be buying some more when it comes time for some capacity upgrades for network storage.",

                "reviewText": "The drive is clearly labeled a 10TB. However when I mounted it, it identified as a 12TB.Sadly because I'm using it in an UnRAID server, the largest drive in the array has to be the parity disk, which in my case was 10TB. I was using this to replace a failed 8TB disk.As such, I had to order another 10TB disk to replace the 8TB. I am currently in the process of swapping out the 10TB parity with this mis-labeled 12TB disk.Update: The drive is functional. It is a reburbished Seagate 12TB Enterprise drive. (Labeled as an MDD 10TB).The \"hours used\" shows 0 (brand new). So far, so good.UPDATE: The drive is working flawlessly so far. My only nits: It doesn't have drive-holes in the same places as other brands (such as WD, HGST). This MDD drive is a rebranded Seagate ST12000NM0127. It seems to be fine, my only other complaint is that this drive is LOUD. Even in a case with 10 other drives, THAT is the one I can hear from across the room. (But it's a server, who cares?)So far things are going well. I will update the review if anything else pops up.",
