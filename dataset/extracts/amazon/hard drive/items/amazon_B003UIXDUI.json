                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a fairly good, but really cheap drive that's about 500GB, this is certainly it. Other reviews indicated they got a Toshiba drive. The drive I got is a Seagate drive. The package indicates that it could be any of 6 brands. Some I trust. Some I don't. Seagate has been making hard drives almost as long as I've been alive. They've got a reputation of being good when they're good. But to be fair and honest, I was looking for an HDD that will rarely be connected and running. I'm using it to back up my primary HDD.The capacity suggests 500GB. But Windows thinks it's only 465.76. The difference is how you calculate GB. If you consider it to be 1024*1024*1024, (actually GiB) then this is only 465.76 GB. If you consider it to be 1000*1000*1000, then sure... this is 500GB. Technically, this is correct. But some manufactures seem to report GB when they really mean GiB, or GiB when they really mean GB. In any event, Seagate is reporting the capacity as 500 GB and Windows is incorrectly reporting it as GB when it should say GiB.The smart data on the drive indicates that it's been power cycled twice, but with 0 hours of on time. So, that indicates the drive is new.",

Otherwise you will may not be able to boot from the new cloned drive, at Acronis True Image will apply a bootability fix to the new disk and adjust the boot settings of the target drive to boot from USB. If the new disk is inside the laptop, the boot settings will be automatically adjusted to boot from internal disk. As such, hard disk bays cannot be used for target disks. For example, if you have a target hard disk (i.e. the new disk to which you clone, and from which you intend to boot the machine) in a bay, and not physically inside the laptop, the target hard disk will be unbootable after the cloning.There are more Cloning software, that you can choose, and Clonezilla or .
