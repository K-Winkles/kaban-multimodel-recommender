                "reviewText": "This is my second MDD brand hard drive. I needed a large capacity hard drive on which I could clone the contents of a much older drive that was running out of space. This drive was available at roughly half the cost of competing drives, and since I had an excellent experience with an earlier, 10 Tb drive purchase for this same brand, I decided to take it.This drive arrived very sturdily packaged. It was well boxed and in a strong wrapper that protects the drive. The wrapper has a note on it suggesting that you format the drive after connecting it (use \"Disk Management\" in Microsoft Windows to do this.) The drive also came with a 3 year warranty card and a second card repeating the advice to format the drive after plugging it in to a Windows system. This is good advice for new purchasers who are not familiar with how to prepare a hard disk drive. Other brands of hard drives don't include such advice with their products. They assume you know what to do.Since cloning one hard drive to another is simply a bit-for-bit copy of an already formatted hard drive, I used the Gnu 'ddrescue' utility to do the cloning. I did not need to pre-format. This utility is available for Linux distributions. I did the cloning on a Linux computer, in other words. The cloning process went very well. Then I installed the drive on a Windows 11 Pro computer, and used the Windows 11 Disk Management utility to extend the volume so that the entire available volume would be recognized. Finally, I completed the installation process by running the Windows chkdsk utility on the new MDD drive to make sure there were no issues with the drive.This is an excellent quality, very tough drive. It is roughly half the cost of other drives. That is a very attractive price point.",
