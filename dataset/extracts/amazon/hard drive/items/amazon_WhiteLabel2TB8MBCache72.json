So... write to it... quickly dumped a random pile of video data, about 35GB, on to it. Speed quickly ranged up to around 120-140mbs, (high end of what USB 3.0 is good for), and no noise, no vibrations, Soooo,so far so good. Will update if it goes wonky in 6 weeks.",

                "reviewText": "This drive arrived quickly and in a sealed anti-static bag, just as I would have expected. I installed the drive and cloned the replaced drive to this new 2tb drive easily. If you know what you're doing, it as easy as can be. You only get the bare drive, no instructions, no screws and no cables. But if you're replacing another drive, when you take your old drive out, you can use the screws and cable from the drive you just replaced. This drive operated just as quietly as the one I replaced and although I didn't run any tests to quantify the performance, it seemed to be at least as fast as the one I replaced. So, for a bare 2tb hard drive, this is an outstanding value and I highly recommend it as a replacement for a smaller drive that is filled up, or to use as additional storage!",
