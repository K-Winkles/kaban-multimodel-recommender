                "reviewText": "I have order many different brands of ssd's in the line of work I do and they vary based on application use case for each project. If you're a media professional and you work with a lot of raw image or high-res video then you may want to go with the samsung evos/kingston/sk hynix line of ssds however for everyday gaming from xbox, ps to pc build this module would do that adequately at a considerably less cost savings.I used this to replace my failing 1tb xbox hdd which after a year starting slowing down tremendously. After disassembling, cleaning, replacing thermal paste and reimaging the xbox was blazingly fast, almost felt like upgraded to the XS. It is important to replace like for like so if you had a 1tb go ahead and replace with a 1tb ssd.I am very happy with the read/write testing I did gives me average 530 read / 500 write.The system runs cooler and I've been using this since april, loading and unloading gigabytes of data, no issues. For the money I spent, I am very satisfied with the value and performance.",

                "reviewText": "Server recently went bananas with logs that were all but indecipherable. After quite a long chase, I determined my 10-year-old, 1TB Samsung 840 EVO boot drive was giving up the ghost.Purchased TEAMGROUP T-Force Vulcan Z 512GB SATA SSD as replacement. Drive has been chugging along beautifully for a couple months. Zero complains. While I haven\u2019t checked my copy, these should normally be kitted with a Silicon Motion SM2258 controller, 64-layer 3D TLC flash from Micron, and Samsung DRAM (according to Tom\u2019s Hardware, she\u2019s able to write larger files at a consistent 525MBps without slowdown).If you want a DRAM-based SATA SSD, I don\u2019t know how you can possibly beat the value here. Proven technologies from a brand that\u2019s been around a very long time and performance tests that place it near the top of the charts in virtually every meaningful scenario. This drive can keep up with a Samsung 860 EVO, no problem at all, but I believe an AES 256 encryption controller is missing from Vulcan drives. If memory serves, having hardware-based encryption enabled (OPAL?) for Windows Pro + Bitlocker is massively more performant than software-based encryption (XTS-AES). Outside of that use case...I have no idea. I know some of the history of SSD hardware encryption controllers, and I refuse to trust them, instead relying on slower (though arguably more reliable and certainly more auditable) software-level encryption solutions. Perhaps this is why Windows Pro defaults to software-based encryption for Bitlocker, performance penalty be darned.I spent 15+ years buying Crucial/Micron and Samsung exclusively, but I\u2019ve recently broadened my horizons with select SSDs from Inland, Hynix, and now TEAMGROUP. Just installed a TEAMGROUP MP44L NVMe in another machine and it\u2019s like riding lightning. I\u2019ll be buying another TEAMGROUP SSD in the very near future, you can be assured.",

All are up to their tasks and seem like they should be good to go for some time.-Read/Write speeds are as advertised, haven't noticed any slow downs.-Price point is better than most competitors for similar quality hardware.I'd say buy with confidence, owning 3 of them I will gladly get more of them for my future SSD needs.",
