        "description": "Supporting capacities up to 2TB, Seagate Pipeline HD series hard drives were designed to deliver 24x7, reliable operation with performance tuning oriented toward low-power consumption, silent operation and smooth video streaming performance. In fact, the Pipeline HD was designed to meet Energy Star and other strict consumer power consumption standards. With the ability to support of up to 16 simultaneous streams of HD content in multiple rooms and operate at temperatures of up to 75\u00b0C, they provide reliable storage with a 24x7 operational profile that enables consumers to take full advantage of premium services like digital video recording and video on demand. Boasting the industry's lowest overall power consumption profiles and coupled with the Seagate commitment to environmental compliance, Pipeline HD drives are more than green; they offer customers a comprehensive sustainability value proposition which incorporates leading environmental stewardship and a focus on customer satisfaction. NOTE: (a) Noisy Drive - Abnormal noises include: 1. High-pitched whining sound can be an indication of abnormal function. 2. Noises can be caused by mounting issues. This is due to either a high-frequency vibration in the mounting hardware or a potential drive failure. 3. Repeated, regular tapping, grinding or beeping. 4. Seagate hard drives do not contain audio speakers. Some failure mechanisms may make a regular repeating beep from the computer's internal speaker. This may or not be hard drive related. Check your system documentation for an explanation of system beep codes. If a drive failure is possible, it is always important to make an immediate backup. 5. Two hard clicks at start up and then a boot error message or system shutdown is a symptom of a failed drive. Check your cables and connections in case they might have gotten loose. (b) If you have received a SMART error, we strongly recommend that you stop everything and make an immediate backup of any and all important data contained on this drive that is not already backed up.",

                "reviewText": "About the drive: Seagate 2TB (from US_Electronics) It works (as it should) - have only been using 1 week. Put it in my desktop RAID array and it rebuilt without a problem. As one reviewer pointed out, it seems that Seagate themselves may not officially honor any warranty. Checking the warranty status via their website returns the message to contact the place of purchase for warranty support (see picture). More importantly, there were no problems with the SMART data (indicates heath of the drive) and it indicates 0 hours of use and powered on/off only 3 times (a reasonable number for testing purposes, plus when 1 for when I powered it on myself). I don't believe the power on count or hours can be easily changed/forged so I'll believe the data. (see picture)About Other Reviews: When reading reviews to consider if I should buy this or not, I noticed some mentioned other sellers (and I thought one even mentioned another brand). I purchased from US_Electronics so can't speak to others. Also, given that this is in a redundant RAID array, if the drive did fail after the Amazon warranty period and the seller didn't do anything, I wouldn't have lost my data - just the money I paid (so I was willing to risk it, so so far no problems).",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these and one crapped out 1 day after I couldn't return to Amazon, and the other went the next day. I will never buy another Seagate product ever again. The drive seemed slow, but I figured it was just because it wasn't a SSD which is what I was used to. 2 months without a hitch using them to back up my disks. So, what would have happened if these drives crapped out and so did my main disk? I'd have been up a river!!Seagate makes horrible hard drives and I cannot stress enough how unhappy I am with them. Two drives bought... Two drives dead!! I bought Toshiba, Western Digital, and even some white label hard drives that have had longer life then these two abominations!! I am done with Seagate. These are just the next in a long string of bad hard drives that I have bought from this company. I was willing to give them another try, but this is beyond inexcusable!! It is like they have rigged these things to last just long enough to work until the Amazon warranty runs out.I build computers and I build a lot of them! I will never again put a Seagate hard drive in to anyone's rig! I will warn them against it and I will tell them this story before steering them towards other more reputable companies! Too many people here have had the same problems and I do not see any end in sight. Seagate, you have lost thousands of dollars from me and my business!!",

I wanted to leave a positive review because I did not have that experience. It arrived working, installed easily (all HDDs do), and is trucking right along. I almost completely filled my drive the day I got it, use it every day, and it's nothing if not reliable. I'll update if anything changes but otherwise I give this drive 5 stars, because that's what I'm getting out of it right now.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Seagate drives in the past. Never really had a problem with them. Then, after putting together a home server and buying a couple of these, one died to the point that the data was gone and couldn't be re-partitioned. The other one I was able to recover the data. At first, I thought it was the motherboard. I sent it in an they told me there was a repair necessary. Fortunately, it was under warranty. They send it back, I get some more new drives, and, in no less than a month, I am having read/speed problems with two others. I connected them up to some USB adapter to read them through the USB ports thinking that it's just the SATA on the motherboard. One drive, even though it was, at least, readable on the motherboard, is giving off nothing but errors through the USB adapter. The other one has the speed of a dial-up connection. I know one of them was connected to a PCI SATA card. So, I now doubt the motherboard was the reason why they're failing on me. The person I bought it from was ISellAll. The thing is I don't know how aware they are with their merchandise. I don't remember how the other drives arrived. But, one hard drive arrived positioned in a corner of the shipping box with cushioning on only one side. They then proceeded to ship me two more drives of which I hadn't bought, shipped the same way.",
