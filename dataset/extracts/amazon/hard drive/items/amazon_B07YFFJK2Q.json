                "reviewText": "This relatively inexpensive SSD is large enough for the intended purpose, and so far hasn't had any problems whatsoever. It's currently set up as two partitions, each with a different O/S version, connected to a working computer. Installation into an enclosure was simple, and the storage capacity is as advertised. There's really not that much to say about a functioning SSD, especially since I don't boot from it very often. I'm quite satisfied with it, and would buy another if I needed more disk capacity.",

                "reviewText": "All right a few things to establish before I get into this:1.) I installed this hard drive on a laptop I only use for writing word documents and browsing the web. I do not game or do any video card intensive things on here. Just admin and work purposes.2.) I didn't rate easy to install because the hard drive itself is easy to install. However, the device you install it to will make a huge difference in how easy it is. If you're sticking this in a desktop case, it's as simple as 1, 2, 3. In my case, I was installing it on a Dell laptop with touch screen capability. The amount of steps took me at least an hour or two because I had to follow a Youtube video.So, I have a old Dell laptop that I bought in 2014-2015 that I needed to use while riding the train to work. It served me well until recently when I started to notice that the laptop was taking longer and longer to boot up and run applications. Boot up time would be about 3 minutes into Windows 10, then launching an app could take anyway from 7-10 minutes before it was ready. So we're looking at almost a total of 15 minutes just to do something basic like open word or a website.I assumed it was because I bought a slow laptop, but when I went into task manager I saw that the HD was always hitting 100% usage the entire time the computer was on. In task manager, under performance, your PC should be between 1% if you're not using anything or running any background programs. But my computer was at 100% with absolutely awful read and write speeds. Meanwhile my CPU was at normal values.So I bought the Sandisk SSD which was compatible with my laptop and went through the process of opening up my laptop to take out the original drive. I highly recommend using the IFixit toolkit with magnetic pad to not lose the dozens of screws you will be messing with and to keep notes.Once I got the original laptop drive out (a Seagate ST1000LM024) I plugged the Seagate and the Sandisk drive into my desktop PC and used a software called AOMEI dynamic disk manager pro edition. (Yes you have to buy this software but it's relatively inexpensive at around $50-$60.I cloned the original Seagate drive to the Sandisk drive. Plugged in the Sandisk, reassembled my laptop, and voila works like a charm. Now the laptop takes less than 30 seconds to boot up and be ready for me to use apps. It's even faster than my other work laptop I use strictly for my job which is newer and more expensive than my old machine.Great little drive that has significantly sped up my laptop which I was going to trash and sell. Really happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "My PC is so much faster in all respects after installing this little gem. I couldn't believe what a difference it made and start up and running most of my apps. I had quite a problem getting it to work though. Physical installation was easy. Then I downloaded the Acronis True Image software from the San Disk website and I installed it and uninstalled it at least a half dozen times. Each time it went through the paces of transferring (cloning) the data from my hard drive to the SSD, but each time I got an error message at the end of the process. I was honestly ready to return it and then finally it cloned the image from my installed hard drive and I was able to boot from the SSD. I was set to go but I have no idea why it finally worked. Tech support is non existent. Took 1 star off the overall rating due to the 4 days it took me to get this going. Maybe those with more expertise will have an easier time. End result is great!",
