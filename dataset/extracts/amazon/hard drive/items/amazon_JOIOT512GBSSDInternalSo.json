When I transferred more than 100 pictures at a time the drive ejected without warning. I rebooted, repeated the same process and it ejected again. I stuck it in a different case and the same thing happened again. So I exchanged cables to make sure that it is not the case and/or cable. Then I thought it might be the speed of the M1. I then used the external drive in an Intel Mac and the drive showed up on the desktop and I transferred 8,687 jpeg pictures in less than 4 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised as to the speed and performance. Then I plugged it back into the M 1 and all the pics were there and it worked perfectly.",
