                "reviewText": "This type of external SSD (1TB here) is used for portable project file backup and transfer between computers.Factors for why I selected the Samsung T9 Pro:* Physically robust construction. Very protective shock shell around the main drive body for absorbing drops,* Thermally robust operation- good internal heat sinking, to safely support high speed USB3 file transfers on USBC- some other brands of SSD, like the standard SanDisk drives I have bought through Amazon have literally burned out transferring large blocks of files. The Samsung Thermal guard works in action as claimed, in my experience with high speed connections and large data sets.* The speed claims seem quite real; this is the fastest external drive I have tested. It's used mainly on a Mac Studio Max computer.",

I have a 2TB Samsung Touch T7 with fingerprint security that is more than 5 times faster at 1050MBS using my TBolt 4 Dell XPS 13 and the supplied TBolt 4 cable (also very happy with the T7 Touch).I decided to pay more than double the Seagate price for the 4TB Samsung T9 with advertised speeds of 2,000MBS. I didn't expect to actually gain any speed over the T7 because reviews I have read suggest more than 1,000MBS is problematic even with end-to-end TB4 hardware. However, this drive is notably faster, probably at least 50% if not more. Very happy I am not wasting more than half a day to do backups anymore. I reformatted the drive from eFat to NTFS prior to using it. I wish they made a touch version of this drive also to provide more security - I keep this one locked in a safe.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to connect it to my Synology NAS to run Roon. They highly recommended it be run on an SSD instead of a HDD so I caved and bought it. I could have gotten something half or a quarter the capacity for a lot less and it would have worked fine, but this was a quick no-brainer.My only complaint is with Amazon and their shipping practice. They shipped this via USPS with simply a shipping label stuck to the box this device came in!!! NO anonymity or security whatsoever!! Somebody along the line could have simply grabbed this for their own use and nobody would be wiser.Thankfully the box DID arrive and it was easy to unpack. It came with two USB-C cables - one with a USB-A connector on one end, and one with a USB-C connector on the other end. A nice touch!I plugged the drive into the NAS, it found it and reformatted it in a matter of a couple seconds. My 20 TB HDD took roughly 18 hours to format in comparison! Everything is working well a day into it and I have hopes for much more enjoyment in the future! In fact, I'm eyeing that 4TB version for my portable music library so that I don't have to worry about the 5TB HDD I'm currently using getting all beat up with file errors...Prices have sure come down since I started looking at these and I'm sure, it will keep falling as capacities keep increasing!",

Samsung has an error in their listing. The product I sent back and asked for a replacement on is going to end up being the exact same size of 1tb. The difference in prices reflects this too. I was wondering why 2tb would be cheaper than 1tb... Do not buy this item!!!!!",
