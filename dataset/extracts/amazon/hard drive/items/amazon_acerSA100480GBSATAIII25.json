                "reviewText": "(NOTE: THIS DRIVE APPEARS TO START OFF COMPLETELY BLANK, UNRECOGNIZED BY COMPUTER, WITH NO APPARENT COPIES OF WINDOWS TO BOOT WITH OR ANYTHING TO START WITH)(You may need to google a guide to get it set up I think, but it's a extremely powerful SSD once set up!)( I used https://www.softwarepro.org/blog/how-do-i-format-an-unallocated-ssd/#m1 ){As of this review, i have just barely set it up, but i plan to update it later if i run into any issues or updates and give a update a week or month later to make sure no issues occur!}For my computer's setup with a 2nd drive ( I still had my ssd to boot windows. If you have only 1 drive, and install a blank without windows, you will probably need to follow entirely seperate instructions for that. These instructions are what i used to set up my 2 drive computer.)1. On Windows 10, Press Windows Button + X to open up a navigation menu. You should see a Disk Management section on Windows 10, Select it.2. You will need to set up your new drive. I Had a 960 GB new drive, displaying a black unallocated setting. I selected it.{Disclaimer: Be very careful with this. Setting up the wrong drive can wipe all data or ruin a drive, so MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DRIVE SELECTED!! These are just the instructions i used to set up my own only on a 2 drive computer replacing a dead 1 tb hdd with this 960 GB tb ssd. Yours may be different. }3. Find your new drive, [It should say something like 'Disk0' or 'Disk1' at the bottom of the screen. Make sure the GB matches your blank drive. On mine, the new drive showed up as a Blank drive showing the 960 GB and listing a black \"Unallocated\" text. Any blue should be a working drive. I set up my black unallocated Drive.Here, you should see a option for MBR (Master Boot Record)And GPT ( GUID Partition table){Unless you're on a extremely OLD machine (Like 10-20 years or older), i think you're supposed to use GPT for most modern computers. It's supposed to offer more corruption protection, efficentcy, and be a better more recent format. I think MBR is for really old computers that were only able to boot off it. }4. Next, i selected Choose the \u201cNew Simple Volume\u201d from the context menu {On this new black unallocated drive} to run a \"New Simple Volume Wizard\". Then, i clicked on the Next button. This began to set up my drive5. Next it brings up a menu to \"Enter the size of a new volume or chose the default value. Hit on the Next button.\". {I just clicked the default settings, i don't think you should mess with this.}6. Next, I had to set up a default Letter to use for the Drive. You can use whatever you want. But i used F since C was my main drive, D (The dead drive) linked to old dead folders, E was my USB folder, and F was the next unused letter. {You can set it up to whatever you want though.}7. You should see a \"Format Partition\" menu with \"Format the Volume with the Following Settings\" option with default settings. I just Selected the defaults without changing anything.8. After clicking on the correct parameters i pressed click on the \u201cNext\u201d button.9. Finally, i clicked on the \u201cFinish\u201d button to format the unallocated space on the drive.Step 10: Profit! My Drive was set up and working on my 2 drive system. I set up some new basic folders like DocumentsF and ProgramsF to save my new stuff. Tested a few test files, did a boot and everything seemed to be working! {It did disconnect once, but it seemed to work the next boot. }After that, my computer seemed finally set up, i was able to see files, use the computer on a 2 drive system. (If you use only 1 drive, i think you might need a way to get the computer booting or back up your old files to the new drive, you probably might need to find a specific guide for that. I still had windows on my old drive to set the new drive up.)Immediately i started noticing a massive speed increase even on stuff i never noticed. My downloads went from 7 mb/s to 20 mb/s on 100 mb/s internet, tripling in download speed from my old hdd (I had no idea downloads were write speed capped!)The internet ran much faster. (I also installed and upgraded 8 gb to 16 gb of ram while i was opening the computer). And the performance increase was great!My only remorse is my old Hard drive went down with some personal files and character arts of some online characters i owned that were almost lost for good. I managed to backup some images to a flash drive before it ended.==== Miscellaneous notes!}As for mentions of the Sata cable. Since i was replacing a internal broken 1 tb hdd of my Acer Nspire, i was able to just use my pre-existing cable inside the laptop to hook up the new ssd. If you only have 1 drive though, it might be a good idea to find out what you need to do on 1 drive.I think it's VERY LIKELY IF YOU ONLY HAVE 1 DRIVE as a blank without windows it probably might not even boot without a usb or cd to boot from(?).{If you only have 1 drive, you should probably google specific instructions for that, you might need to set up and copy your old drive before it fails. It's probably better sooner than sorry after the 3-5 year point. Apparently hard drives tend to be good for 3-5 years before failing, and mine disconnected once before working again before completely losing all data after 5 years.{BACK anything important UP ASAP BEFORE YOU LOSE IT ALL if it's starting to corrupt!. Solid state drives are supposed to be good for like 5-10 years before failing. }== Summary ==Anyways, for what it's worth, this drive arrives COMPLETELY blank, no data, no windows, not even recognized by default on a Acer machine, nada. But once set up, it seems extremely powerful runs well, and gives powerful performance increases.There's lots of reviews of people adding the drive and not having it work. I admit i had to spend nearly 1-3 hours taking my computer out, and spending 1-2 hours figuring out how to get the ssd working. I thought i'd share what worked for me since i was only able to figure out how to fix my Acer Aspire Model: vn7-571g computer from someone who did the same 5 years ago.It seems like a wonderful drive, it's just complicated to set up and seems like it might not work out of the box for windows 10, but if you do, it seems really powerful for the price and 75$ for a 1 tb ssd is a bargain!",

                "reviewText": "Update 10-6-22: I received the SSD replacement today ending my saga. It seems to be working fine. If I can survive a year with the remaining hard drives without them too dying then I will bump my review way up. Support is not bad, just make sure you keep in touch and don't expect it to be solved without your input.Update 10-5-22: I received a call from support today, and a confirmation email, that the replacement drive has been shipped.Update 10-4-22: About a month later and I have yet to hear anything back, I reached out to support again and they were able to locate my return request but did not seem to know what to do with it, seemed to imply that the address I shipped it to was my address even though it was theirs. Nice people on support, however does not help when the service itself is below average. Will update with more as it goes along.Update 9-11-22: About a week later and I have yet to hear anything back about a replacement. The live chat went through and the item was shipped out a day or so later. Will update as more progress is made on the replacement as especially with electronics the warranty is as important as the product.Update 8-30-22: I am currently in contact with Acer support in an attempt to get the replacement via their warranty. I will update this further on the process. I can give a drive or two failing a pass, especially if the replacements are fine, if the warranty is good. So far contacting via Email is an impossible task so best recommended to do live chat when they are open.OG Review: I purchased two of these in February 2022. One was the 240 GB model and the other one was the 480 GB model. Both of them worked well out of the box. They are fast, as expected, and were basically the space that was advertised. I was very pleased for a while.The 480 GB was used exclusively for music sample packs. The only time any data was written to the drive was when I initially got it and put the samples onto the drive. For the next 6 months it was exclusively being read and not written to. The 240 GB one was used for video games.Sometime in early August, about 6ish months later, the 480 GB drive died. When it died, it was almost unnoticeable until I no longer could access the drive. It seemed to die piece by piece with more and more files being unrecognized before finally Windows couldn't access the drive.While the 240 GB one is still going strong, I can not say I recommend to get an Acer branded SSD. Regardless if I have a 50% success rate, having a drive die is critical, especially if I used it for anything other then some music samples.Avoid this. There are plenty of others around this price point which are more reliable.",
