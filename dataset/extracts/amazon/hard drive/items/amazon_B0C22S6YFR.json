Thankfully, the Avolusion PRO-Z 20TB features a ridiculously easy case to open to see what's inside... There's a \"void warranty\" sticker on the outside, but, legality aside, for science this must be opened. The casing comes apart like the Playstation 5 casing (I mean, this thing even looks a bit like a PS5), - you just slide the white panels to the side, and you're left with just a few Phillips screws to remove.Once in, and... it's a Seagate EXOS 20TB 7200rpm enterprise drive. These are good drives, but you'd get a longer warranty buying the drive and grabbing your own enclosure, so bear this in mind. This comes with custom labeling on the drive, so nope, the serial number won't be recognized by Seagate for warranty purposes direct with them, - you'd need to go through Avolusion.Speeds are good in the plastic enclosure (no metal here), at around 250MB/s read and write connected to my Mac. It came formatted for Windows, but it only takes a few seconds to reformat for a Mac if you want to use it there.Overall, this is a good drive, but I feel like money is better spent on the drive and enclosure separately, for that longer warranty. That said, if you're not inclined, this is ready to go out of the box.4 out of 5. Good.",
