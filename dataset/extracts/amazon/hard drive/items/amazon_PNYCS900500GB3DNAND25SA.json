                "reviewText": "This works great for replacing the hard drive on my PS4. It is pretty fast for a budgeted PS4 drive. It is thinner in height compared to most 2.5 disk drives but it will fit in your ps4 without much issues. I has a standard aluminum case and I had no trouble installing it. I did want to see how this would perform on on both Mac and PC so I tried it with that first also was my way to test the speed. The drive was able to work without any issues. It did not require any additional software and it was just a plug in play (minus the initialization. It also fit the sata port pretty well. The only thing I would say if you are installing this in laptops with a holder is that you may need to hold it up slightly as it is thinner than your normal 2.5 disk drive but honestly it would not be too much of a difference in installation. You always need to initalize it even with external. I did want to test the transfer speed using a 3.0 enclosure and the transfer speed is not too bad which is good. There was no extreme heat up to an alarming. I did a memory verification just to be safe and the storage memory is correct so you can be sure your data is safe. The speed works pretty well for my ps4. The games load faster and the PS4 does not lag during intense cut scenes which is what I wanted. I test it against some other 2.5 solid state drives (Samsung and WD) as well as the Seagate Hybrid drive and it was not bad. It is pretty on par with the most brand solid state drives. It is definitely a good drive to use for an upgrade from a disk drive to a higher capacity and faster storage. Unfortunately with so many games being big files 1 TB does fill up pretty quick. I was able to transfer all the data from my old PS4 drive to my new one but it did take time to back up and restore everything. Overall I like this drive. It has been reliable and fast. I have not had any issues with it slowing down or failing.",

                "reviewText": "I've used these for a few years now, I've bought numerous ones in different sizes. They are fast (maybe not the fastest these days, but a definite upgrade over platter) and cheap. There's not much more to be said, if you want to cheaply upgrade a computer still running on platter drives, this is a great option for the storage portion of the upgrade. RAM would likely be the other thing if it's still running with 4gb of RAM. We use these at work as well for the same purpose and they buy us a lot of performance for little cost and reduce our need to fully replace older PCs.",

There is no information or instruction sheet on the inside. The back of the box does note that it has a 3-year limited warranty, and if you wish details to go to the manufacturer's website.In my case, I'm not physically stalling this drive into a computer, I'm using it as an external storage device. Windows, of course did not recognize the hard drive immediately, since it is new and non-formatted. I barely had to initialize the drive and format the drive to NTFS so that it was usable for my storage.After setting up the drive, it worked normally for my storage needs.",
