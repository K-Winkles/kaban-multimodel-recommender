                "reviewText": "VERY IMPORTANT: When reading reviews, make sure they say \"verified purchase\", otherwise, it's just the seller scamming you.I did purchase this external hard drive because I just bought a new MacBook Pro and needed to transfer my files over to my new Mac. I used to have an older model that still had USB flash drive ports. If you are a Mac person, you know what a pain it is to switch from an older model to a newer model with different ports. What I love about the Silicon Power hard drive is that it can adapt to both the USB flash and Type C drive. (I don't even know if I'm using the correct terms.) I was able to connect to my old MacBook with the USB cable to transfer my files, then I just switched to the Type C cable (which is included) to transfer the files over to my new Mac. It was pretty fast to me, but I'm not that picky. It only takes a couple of seconds to transfer the files.I say \"so far, so good\" because I've only had the drive for a couple days now. It's worked fine for me, but who knows what will happen as time goes on. Fingers-crossed that everything will still be working okay.",
