I've become a big fan of refurbished business-class hardware in general. The system has been up and running continuously with this drive for 17 days without the slightest hiccup.Given that these drives have a ridiculously long MTBF, plus are under warranty by the seller, it seems like a no brainer - at least for non-critical applications like mine, which is mostly multimedia storage and backup of the primary NVMe system drive.A minor nitpick is that the S.M.A.R.T attributes were all reset prior to sale, so there's no way to know details like Power-On Hours. I'm sure the number is high, but to reach the MTBF would take over 100 years of use. I performed a thorough scan under Linux before entrusting any files to it. So while I'm curious, I'm not worried. Any drive can fail at any time, so if you're not routinely backing up important data that's on you.",

Pero despues comenzo a hacer mucho ruido al escribir/leer datos, hice un examen para ver su estado y tenia sectores da\u00f1ados, su estado general habia bajado de 100% a un 77% esto no es para nada normal en un HDD.",
