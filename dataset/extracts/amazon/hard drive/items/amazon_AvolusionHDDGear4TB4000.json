                "reviewText": "Originally purchased for my Xbox One S, then reformatted and used for my PS4 Pro after trading consoles. It worked wonderfully for both consoles without many issues during use. It was quite a bit easier to set up on my PS4 than it was for my Xbox, although I am unsure if that was just my personal experience with it. When I plugged it into my Xbox, I had a bit of a difficult time figuring out how to find it, and after finding out how, realised my Xbox wasnt detecting it. The Xbox also prompted me that it was connected to the HD over and over if i put it into low power mode, and then turned it back on later. I also had to manually set everything to install to it, as the console kept prompting me that I was out of useable memory before hand.. After unplugging it a couple times and replugging it in, I got it to work in just a few minutes. When I plugged it into my PS4, the console automatically detected it, and brought up a page asking if I would like to format it. It very quickly formatted, and instantly began saving all content to the device.",
