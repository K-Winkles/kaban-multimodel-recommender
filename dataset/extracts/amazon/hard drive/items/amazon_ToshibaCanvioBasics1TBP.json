The drive comes in a nice case (black) and for me using Win 10 it was plug and play \u2013 convenient, very convenient. I\u2019ve used it a few weeks now and everything is working well as to reading and writing. It is running cool to the touch too. There have been zero errors and it writes quickly even though my computer is a bit older.Only con is that I wish the cable were a bit longer as I have to sit it on top of the tower and would prefer it next to the computer. A minor complaint and I plan to buy another in the near future.",

I moved my pictures and videos off my laptop and it was a breeze. I just bought my wife a new laptop and it is good but doesn't have the 1TB or more that I wanted. None of them did actually so I plan on buying a second one of these. Its fast and simple!",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE how quickly this drive copies files in comparison to the speed of a usb or thumb drive. I kinda wish I would\u2019ve got a bigger storage capacity now that I know how great this thing is. It\u2019s reliable and a great way to organize all my photos and files. Downside; I could not copy photos from my old Mac to it for some reason\u2026 idk if it\u2019s just bc it\u2019s an older Mac but it didn\u2019t seem very compatible. I could view the files already on the drive, but that was it. Couldn\u2019t move anything to it from the computer. I did get a slightly newer hp computer and this drive works VERY well with it. My only future concern is that the cord seems like it may wear down quickly and I\u2019ll have to figure out a replacement, as the side of the cord that plugs into the drive is a very unique shape and sometimes seems like it comes out a little too easily but other than that baby concern I love this thing! I just purchased a 1 terabyte and needed it for large photography files, but Id gladly buy another one if this one fills up. Worth the price! Doesn\u2019t get hot, doesn\u2019t make any noise and does exactly what it\u2019s intended to do!",
