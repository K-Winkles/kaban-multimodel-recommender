                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars But I never heard of them",
                "reviewText": "In this review I will leave it to others, many others, to argue things like speed. I don\u2019t see the point \u2013 everyone\u2019s going to get completely different real life speeds compared to those who glower over bench tests which seem to never exactly agree with each other anyway. My rule when considering any memory is to buy it, install it, try it and if it works for you keep it, if not try something else. In today\u2019s world most memory devices are capable of near real-time speeds and the average user doesn\u2019t need the maximum theoretical on-paper speeds for their everyday home computing, or even business needs. My focus is based more on two things \u2013 does the company who makes the memory device know what they are doing and is what they make reliable. Let\u2019s start with the first, if you were to walk down any average street and ask a thousand people to name a brand of computer memory the chances that even one of them would name SK Hynix, yet this company is the second largest maker of memory in the world. Many of the most famous brands of electronic devices use this brand exclusively and have for many years. It is only recently that they have come out of their cocoon and started to sell under their own, albeit awkward, name.IS IT RELIABLEIf someone answers yes or no to that question, move on, they are giving you the wrong answer. No computer memory manufacturer sets out to make a memory device that purposely fails. Buying any brand, repeat that, any brand is a gamble. Sooner or later you will run into a product that messes up. Some will immediately suggest that the entire brand name is a bad choice. Again, move on. If I am playing the law of averages my choice would be to choose the biggest or second biggest manufacturer of memory devices in the world \u2013 I\u2019m guessing they know what they are doing. Related to reliability is connectivity \u2013 many drives I own have loose ports which can result in lost data. The two included cables with this one are very substantial and lock in place with a satisfying click. I should say that this company\u2019s entire presentation is first rate, with the minor exception of what I mention below.MAKING A DECISIONChoosing which one to buy, assuming we are talking about portable SSD\u2019s now, really comes down to which one is on sale, which one looks prettiest and which one has the longest warranty. One the first score I chose this one on a whim, fully knowing who SSK Hynix is, because it was on a Black Friday sale and I bought it with my own money, and I liked the soft rounded corners because I actually did plan on using it as a mobile storage media and it feels good in my jeans pocket. The gold color was a plus to immediately make it identifiable in a drawer full of other devices. And I liked their choice of connectivity, which fit into every one of my devices without having to carry an adapter. And the 3 year warranty is definitely a big plus.SURPRISESMuch of the product page is written in Chinese, I\u2019m surprised that they have never translated it for our domestic market. Although they mention it I was surprised that they include a thick silicone case which is clear so it doesn\u2019t hide the beauty of the design. Unfortunately that beautiful design is only on one side of the product itself, the other side is bland silver and totally filled with written text. Another surprise is that although they say that they provide customized SK Hynix edition Macrium cloning software for data transfers and OS migration. Along with our Easy Kit software, so you can check the performance and status of your SSD at a glance. Neither of those apps is on the drive, in the box nor referred to in the brief instruction sheet. That is a disappointment and dropped them down a notch.YES NO MAYBEBased on my own criteria this was an easy decision and I like that it arrived without being loaded with bloatware. It seems rugged and it does not get unreasonably warm in use. And yes it is fast but everything I own is new generation. The everyday price is a bit high so if that were my only criterion I might have thought twice but I bet it goes on sale fairly often. Overall I am happy.",
