Soft at first, relatively louder over time until eventually it was unbearably loud even when Xbox was turned off. I flipped its position and the sound stopped. Then it began again with soft soft noise, slowly got louder, when I put it in the first position it was still loud. Then the real problems started. The CONSTANT corruption of my data files. Cue me wiping, reformatting, redownloading everything multiple times in the last 6-8 months. It would work for about a month after hours of reformatting and redownloding, then make error codes when starting games/apps, then eventually saying those games and apps don\u2019t exist on the hard drive or Xbox. Would not recommend this, don\u2019t be cheap spend a little extra dough on a better hard drive and you\u2019ll thank yourself later.",

The cancellation got hung up and i disconnected the drive. I then connected the HWAYO drive to my work PC thinking a transfer of files from work internal HD to HWAYO external HD would be faster. Work computer requires Bitlocker encryption so i expected a prompt for encrypting the HWAYO drive. My work laptop would not even recognize the HWAYO drive. So I disconnected the HWAYO drive and rebooted my work PC but it would not reboot without the bitlocker password for my internal HD. Somehow my work PC configuration got screwed up and my company IT department had to take my computer to fix. The HWAYO went in the electronics recycling",
