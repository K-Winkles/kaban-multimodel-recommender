Everything going for it.So far seems like a great deal, and it has got to be a major feat to break into a market dominated by big names such as Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba, etc.The big question is its reliability and performance over the long term. Guess we'll find that out over time, and if it fails I will come back here and drop the rating, if not, I will raise it to 5/5.A very impressive product with great price. 4/5",
