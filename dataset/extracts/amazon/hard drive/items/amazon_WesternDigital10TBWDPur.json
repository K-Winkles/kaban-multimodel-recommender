The things are absolute beasts, and their resilience and beefiness is exactly why I use them for my \"small\" personal render farm (one 2-disc 36TB RAID-0 for smaller renders, and a 5-disc 90TB RAID-0 tower for bigger renders) in my home office. Sure, I could have gone for the \"Black\" version that a lot of gamers prefer (if they are using SATA instead of SSD), but these drives are larger capacity with the same speed, and built to handle even more stress.Should last me several years, no problem, but I will collect a couple more to keep on hand in case (or when) any of the originals fail...Eventually, yes, I'll likely go all-SSD in the future, but not until they are at the same price-point, with the same-or-greater TB size, and equally \"indestructible\".Brilliant slabs of hardware.",

                "reviewText": "Utilizing the WD Purple drives in my NAS Blueiris Server, which diligently records footage from 12 cameras around the clock, has been an astute decision. While configuring my storage solution, I weighed several considerations, and one that prominently featured was my acceptance of potential catastrophic drive loss on that data. This decision led me to opt out of running backups or implementing a RAID configuration. However, I still yearned for a level of reliability that would minimize the need for frequent server intervention. That's where WD Purple drives have truly excelled.These drives have proven to be the perfect fit for my needs. Their specialized design for surveillance systems and continuous recording provides a reassuring level of durability and performance. I appreciate that they can withstand the constant write cycles, ensuring longevity even under demanding 24/7 operation. While I've accepted the possibility of drive failure, the reliability of WD Purple drives has given me peace of mind that I won't have to tinker with the server frequently. They've struck that sweet spot between reliability and performance, making them the ideal choice for those who prioritize continuous surveillance recording without the need for complex redundancy systems. WD Purple drives have been the dependable backbone of my surveillance setup, and I couldn't be happier with their performance.",

Due to the nature of my job, I use hard disks a lot. I always use a hard disk when installing a camera, but before using this product, I always had problems with the hard disk and had to go to service. Since finding, purchasing, and using this product, the number of times I have to go to service for a hard disk problem has become very rare. Due to the nature of the camera hard drive running 24 hours a day, I highly recommend this product.",

It automatically formatted and initialized upon powering-up, went smoothly with no problems. I am using this with 16 4K (8 megapixel) IP cameras, so this internal hard drive was definitely needed. It is working great so far which is worth a 5-star rating; however, I am giving it a 4-star overall rating because the \"What's in the box\" says it includes \"Mounting Screws, Quick Install Guide.\" These 2 items were missing in the box. Even though the box was securely sealed, only the hard drive was enclosed in the sealed box. Also, be aware that the SATA data cable and power cable are not included with this item. You will need to already have your own, or purchase them separately. This hard drive is running smoothly and quietly in my NVR 24/7.",
