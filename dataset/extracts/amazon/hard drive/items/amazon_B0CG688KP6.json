The latter of which are everywhere in a workshop, pretty much all the time. The usb-c to usb-c cord it came with for the inside of the case connects with a satisfying \"click\" and feels very secure, funnily enough, more secure than the cable the SSD itself came with. The compartment in the other half of the case leaves room for at least 2 additional SSD's of similar size, or another USB cable and adapters which is a nice touch.Worth it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have a couple of the SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD drives and was looking for a protective case. This case fits the bill. The case is stylish and provides a protective cushion for the SSD drive. There is also space for additional accessories like SD cards or cable adapters.I give the case 3 stars for the following reasons:- I was expecting the case to be super hard - it is not. It is flexible meaning you can easily push and bend the case covers.- The provided clamp is made if hard plastic, not steel. I would not be comfortable attaching this to a book bag, backpack, or purse for safe-keeping of a hard drive.- The built-in USB C connector is finicky - initially it did not work (see video). After a couple attempts of rearranging the internal cable, I did get it to work (see 2 pics following video). And then it didn\u2019t. Finicky.Final conclusion: I am comfortable using this drive for storing my SSD drive and transporting within my home. For travel purposes, I will tuck it within a protective area within my travel bag - not attached it to an external loop. Hope this review helps!",
