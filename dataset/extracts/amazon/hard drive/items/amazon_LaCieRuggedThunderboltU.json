                "reviewText": "If you're still using a Mac with Thunderbolt 2 connections and are stuck using all kinds of workarounds to get decent transfer speeds from external storage then here's, well, another workaround! The cool thing about this drive is that it can be quickly & easily opened up rendering it a Thunderbolt drive enclosure. True, it's a pricey enclosure but good luck finding ANY Thunderbolt 2 enclosure otherwise. The Seagate HDD inside can be used for whatever (get an $8 USB 3 enclosure and give it to a friend or connect it to wi-fi and make it external storage for your phone!) and a sexy new SSD can be inserted in its place. The whole swap involves 6 screws and a little tape (AND the torching of the LaCie warranty, mind you...). There're YouTube tutorials to walk one through the 5-minute process. You'll ultimately be limited by the SATA connection (to around 6 Gb/s I think), but that's nothing to sneeze at, especially if you've been stuck using those lousy USB 2.0 ports. Thank goodness for USB-C - now if we can just get Apple to let go of crappy Lightning tech - egads. Anyhow, give your Mac the gift of long life with an easy peasy speed enhancement and postpone all that traitorous talk of impending retirement for the beloved beast.",

For my Mac I have a Time Capsule that is one of these drives and another La Cie that I got with the computer. My original Apple Time Capsule and Wi-Fi router failed and I replaced it with one of these. This second one goes to the safe deposit vault at the bank and about every month I go and get it, back my data up and then return it to the bank. I have decades of my life on my computer and loosing it would be devastating so, ya I'm over the top in some peoples eyes but not mine.The drive is kind cool with it's orange jacket and built in Tbolt cable and I don't worry too much using it at home and in the office. Also it can be partitioned into two drives with one partition being Mac and the other being FAT32. Very easy to set up with software that comes on the drive.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Hola amaz\u00f3nicos!!He adquirido el disco duro Lacie con Thunderbolt 2 y USB 3.0. 1TB.Es un producto que, por construcci\u00f3n, no se le puede poner pegas: fabricaci\u00f3n en Aluminio y recubrimiento de goma/silicona que le protege, y bien, de las ca\u00eddas. Comparado con los otros discos duros que tengo externos, es m\u00e1s voluminoso, pero no es inc\u00f3modo de transportar y, gracias a su protecci\u00f3n de silicona, se agarra bien y no desliza en ninguna superficie. Adem\u00e1s tienes ese extra de protecci\u00f3n.Para no hacer muy extensa la opini\u00f3n, me voy a centrar en:+ Ventajas:- Protecci\u00f3n frente a ca\u00eddas y derrame de l\u00edquidos.- Construcci\u00f3n y acabados.- Soporte de la marca y software que viene incluido: con \u00e9l, al empezar a usarlo, te da la opci\u00f3n de hacer una doble partici\u00f3n: una con tipo de archivo propietario de Apple (HFS+) y otra con archivos compatibles con el resto de sistemas Fat32 o exfat.- Registro y soporte de la marca Lacie (adquirida por Seagate).- Velocidad frente a otros HD externos USB 3.0, tanto con el propio cable USB como con el Thunderbolt.- Doble conexi\u00f3n: Thunderbolt 2 y USB 3.0.- Empaquetado desde distribuidor espectacular por protecci\u00f3n. Un 10 en este aspecto.+Desventajas:- Tama\u00f1o mayor que otros discos duros externos de 2.5 de la competencia.- Precio alto, hasta 3 veces m\u00e1s caro que uno de la misma capacidad... Pero sin Thunderbolt 2, claro.+Inconveniente:- En comparaci\u00f3n con discos duros externos con SSD y USB 3.0, es m\u00e1s lento en lectura y escritura de archivos. Me explico:He hecho pruebas con programas espec\u00edficos que hacen pruebas y miden la velocidad de los discos duros con diferentes tipos de archivos. Y me han dado una m\u00e1xima de 135-137 MB/S en escritura y 137-140 MB/S de lectura con Thunderbolt. Con la conexi\u00f3n USB unos 5 MB/S menos de media. Casi igual.Con una caja externa 3.0 y SSD con el mismo programa y ordenador (MacBook Pro i7 y 16GB De RAM) me ha dado resultados de 350MB/S de escritura y casi 400 de lectura.Por lo tanto, si este Lacie tuviera un SSD en su interior... Con Thunderbolt seguro que triplicaba la de este USB. Pero no voy a cambiar el interno por un SSD porque perder\u00eda la garant\u00eda... Adem\u00e1s, con los datos que ofrece, para mi uso, me es suficiente.Espero que os sirva de ayuda esta parrafada.Saludos cordiales!!",

I bought this to record on location so the heavy duty protection was quite important. I haven't dropped it yet - I don't really intend to - but it is a nice safety blanket.I have only used the thunderbolt connection, I'm still not sure of the speed of USB3 for recording and can't really afford dropouts. Runs at 7400 rpm, I had no disk read speed errors or connectivity problems. It works really well from the bus power on the laptop, but obviously running this and an audio interface rapidly depletes battery power. Obviously though, right, no fault of LaCie there!I've never had any problems with LaCie before, didn't expect any with this, and it works perfectly.",
