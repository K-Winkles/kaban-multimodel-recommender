I thought at worst, I could just return if it had an issues . It\u2019s been over a month now and no issues. It comes with a 3 year warranty which is good to know. I got the 18tb drive and it actually is 18tb. Works great and works as it should. I do believe they are refurbished drives but they are well worth it. Well packaged.",
