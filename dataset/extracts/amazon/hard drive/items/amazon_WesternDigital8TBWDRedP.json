                "reviewText": "EFBX drives are quiet, reliable, and pretty fast. This was a good generation for Western Digital. These are CMR drives with large caches and perform pretty decently. I run a pair of QNAP TR-004 enclosures, one with 4 x 8TB and one with 4 x 10TB, all WD Red Plus EFBX. Both in RAID 5 for a total of 24TB and 30TB respectively. They make for reasonably fast, responsive protected storage for media streaming, emulation, big media projects, and long-term archival. If I were really serious about protecting my data I'd do the same thing with SSDs or keep an offsite backup. However for this computer nerd of a few decades, it's nice to just have a big blob of storage to keep all my files on. Spinning disks keep things cheap enough for now, and RAID 5 provides just enough security to sleep at night. As spinning disks start to go the way of the dodo, it's going to get increasingly difficult to buy good ones without compromises in the normal consumer space. These are part of a dying breed of hardware. SSDs will overtake them in value and it won't be soon enough.",

Since it's larger than 4TB, a different formatting procedure was required than I was used to; to be able to access the full capacity of the drive. It has a distinctive sound from my other drives, but it's not unreasonably noisy. Hopefully it will be reliable.It was packaged with adequate insulation and factory sealed. This one was made in Thailand on Nov 4, 2023, ordered on Nov 23 and received on Nov 29, 2023; so freshly produced. 5 stars for now.",

So far very pleased.Performs decently even under load (multiple requests at once)-- that would be the NCQ at work.Large straight-line writes (no contention) are comfortably north of 200MB/s, similar straight-line reads are near 220MB/s.Also it's very quiet: I test drives in an open SATA USB cradle before installation, and this is the quietest \"large\" drive I've listened to. It gets warm in the cradle, but not as hot as some drives.Arrived with no bad blocks. Good price per GB. And Western Digital finally saw the light and made this Plus line which returns to classic CMR tech (versus low-performing SMR). At 7200rpm with 6Gb SATA, this is about as fast as a consumer-grade spinning drive will get.Fellow nerds, this is how FreeBSD sees it (Linux would see similar):WDC WD101EFBX-68B0AN0 85.00A85 ACS-2 ATA SATA 3.x device600.000MB/s transfers (SATA 3.x, UDMA6, PIO 8192bytes)Command Queueing enabled9537536MB (19532873728 512 byte sectors)Highly Recommended.

                "reviewText": "I have always used the WD Red drives in my servers and NAS units since they brought them out...this is going all the way back to the WHS 2011. They are good drives, economically priced and last for ever in the right conditions. I recently migrated over from a WHS box to a WD server, and these were the natural choice for it. They were recognized immediately and set up quickly in the WD server. As I monitor the health, there have been no critical issues for the drives in the 7 months they've been in the WD server. I recently added two more 4TB drives in the Raid 1 function, which now gives me 8TB of secure and stable storage. This matches the level of performance that my original 4- 1TB Red drives I had in my WHS 2011 server, which to this day, is still showing as healthy in the pooled drive array as reported in the SMART monitoring.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Time Limited Error Recovery (TLER) for NAS/RAID usage.Price premium much lower/insignificant compared to what it used to be for NAS/RAID drives.Low power/Low temp.Cons:Warranty only 3 years (What happened to the 5-year warranties, WD?)I've seen failures in many drives from Seagate, WD, and other vendors in the past. Hard drives fail. Even SSDs fail sometimes. That's why RAID configurations are so popular. All versions of RAID configuration (except for RAID 0) introduce redundancy, such that if any single drive fails, no data need be lost. Full redundancy can be regained by rebuilding the array with a replacement drive, theoretically keeping your data safe from single single points of hardware failure indefinitely.These NAS drives go one step further in that their behavior is optimized for a RAID environment. In particular, Time Limited Error Recovery (TLER) allows them to rely on the redundancy built into the RAID controller and the overall array to handle the sorts of errors which will inevitably pop up at some point. This reduces risks to data that can be caused by the behaviors of regular desktop disks, whose designers optimized them for environments where there is no RAID array backup. I have been running RAID arrays regularly with desktop drives for over 6 years now, and it's been a pretty frequent occurrence where a drive would suddenly have to be rebuilt for no apparent reason. In all likelihood, the reason was just a few bad sectors on the disk, which happens all the time. The total failure rate of drives in a RAID has been a little above normal, but the total rebuild rate without total failure has been very high. Read up on TLER, and you'll understand why that is expected behavior with desktop drives but not with NAS drives. The total drive rebuild process is actually fairly risky to the integrity of the data, considering that in most configurations there is no redundancy while this is happening. Therefore, making sure that a total rebuild doesn't happen unless necessary is a pretty good idea if you want to protect your data. That's why I am upgrading my RAID arrays with these drives.In response to the reviewer who complained that the WDIDLE3 issue affects these drives:I just bought 4 of these drives in the 1TB version from Amazon. (July 2015) All are model WD10EFRX. I ran WDIDLE3 /R to read the current value of the timer on all four of them before connecting them to my RAID controller. All four came set to 300 seconds (5 minutes.)This is a very reasonable value for most NAS/RAID usage, and certainly not as problematic as the 8 second timer that caused the well-known problems on some previous WD drives. If you're using these to mount an OS drive or a drive in Windows, that 5 minute timer will probably never be invoked. If you're using these on a 24/7 NAS or for non-OS storage in Linux like I do, that timer could lead to considerable power savings and reduced average temperatures, the latter of which will probably extend the life of the drive, not shorten it.The only way I could see the 300 second idle timer being a problem is if you're running a script that causes disk access every 6 minutes (or 10 or 15.) i.e. if there's something that regularly forces spin-up right after the disk idle has gone into effect. In that case, WDIDLE3 is included on the ultimate boot CD version 5.3.5 and can be used to disable the timer. An idle timeout of 300 seconds is a pretty good feature in most cases, though.P.S. I have four more 3TB versions of this drive in transit for my NAS (the 1TBs were for my linux desktop) I will check the default WDIDLE3 values on them as well and post here if they prove to be different.",
