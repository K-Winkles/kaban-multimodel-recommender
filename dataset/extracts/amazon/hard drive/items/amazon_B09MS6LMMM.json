                "reviewText": "RATING: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50.5STEAM: \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Hard Drive is the second installment of January Bell's Neon Renegade series. Cyn had given up hope to get out from Nustof's control. After the Impericorps invaded her town, she escaped to Briganed only to be indentured by the Outerspace crime boss. Now she has become a sought-out hacker, but as Nustof slowly but surely loses control, she becomes a liability.Fintan is brought in as a Cymech guard to watch over Cyn, but he is not fully under Nustof's control, either. The two form an alliance and escape.My favorite part about January Bell's books is her wonderful world-building. Not only does she serve an engaging story with very relatable characters, but she also creates a vibrant backdrop to each read. Hard Drive is no different. Fintan and Cyn immediately capture our attention with their chemistry, and the action and suspense keep us turning the pages. Fintan is silent, broody, and protective. He is especially considerate of Cyn's history and boundaries. And Cyn! Bell is two-for-two with strong and formidable heroines as Cyn brings fierceness and determination.I also fell in love with the side characters, especially Tweak, Cyn's quirky AI, and Bear.This can be read as a standalone. Bell does a great job of providing context to Book 1 references. But readers would be remiss to get the full experience if they don't start from the beginning.",

Hero is a fun broody type.There's an awol ai with its own personality..Yeah it's good.I did skim a few to get to the action scenes (in a hilarious reversal) - but this space plot is 100% where my interest is engaged!Fun, cute, romantic.",

Of course there is also romance, and even though it is part of a series, it is a standalone romance- with an HEA.A thoroughly entertaining space-themed sci-fi romance, recommended for fans of the genre.",

This one leans more on the romantic side than the previous book did, but I like the sweet romance between the two characters more. Fintan is more of a cinnamon roll than Riker (lead from previous book).I read this as part of the Rogue Cymech Warriors book bundle, so it was nice to have all the stories flow together. I really loved the epilogue that let us see the HEA for all the characters.",
