The new ones don't have ethernet ports or number pads on the keyboards. I may be old fashioned but I prefer ethernet connection over Wi-Fi. It is much faster and safer too. Anyways, I missed my old computer so I order this and replaced it within an hour. It was an easy install and I was able to download the Windows software for free online. I booted it from a flash drive and bam. It works just as good as new. I've been using it for several months now. I love it! I wish I had known how easy the install and how inexpensive the hard drive is. It would've saved me $500.",
