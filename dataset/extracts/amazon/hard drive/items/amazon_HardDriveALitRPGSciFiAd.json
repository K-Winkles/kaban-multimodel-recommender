The action and suspense are pretty well handled and outside of a few typos here or there the book was overall written very well. When it comes to the erotic scenes they lacked a little viscerality that made them a little lackluster but overall they were still very enjoyable.Im looking forward to the end of this story and seeing how everything turns out.",
