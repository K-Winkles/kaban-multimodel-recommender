                "reviewText": "I purchased this hard drive for my computer so I can save my documents and pictures to it, I've had such a horrible expirience in the past when my previous computer crashed on me all of a sudden and I didnt back any of my important documents or pictures up and ending up losing everything! I wanted to be proactive this time so I recently got a new computer and looked at several options for a hard drive and came across this one and so far I'm very happy with it! I plugged it into my computer as soon as I received it and was amazed with how easy it was to setup! It came with a USB cord so I plugged one end into the hard drive and the other end into my computer. I have windows 10 and went into my documents folder and it was already listed on there. All I had to do was right click on it to format it which took only a few seconds and then I was able to just click on the document folders I wanted to back up and drag them into the \"Teyadi\" external hard drive folder and that was all, my documents and pictures are now backed up! This was my first expirience buying and setting up an external hard drive and I was so very happy with how quick and easy it was to setup and would definately recommend to anyone looking for a good external hard drive for such a low price point. I put a ton of docs and pics in it and still have so much more room available on it.",
