Invariably boots up to Windows without ever providing a program dialog. While I mention the instructions, they are very poorly written and in a font so small that it takes a magnifying glass to read. Literally. Likewise, the service line is of no help. Their website does not address the issue, nor does it provide any user instructions in larger print. The telephone service line is a recording that says it is too busy to answer. No timely response to text inquiry. Apparently, this software was discontinued in 2015 and no longer tech supported, according to Fossbites review.",
