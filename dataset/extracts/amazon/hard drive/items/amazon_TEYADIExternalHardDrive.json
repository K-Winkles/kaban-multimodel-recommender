It is very comparable in material, design, size, storage capacity, and speed of transfer to other industry leading competitive brands. USB 3.0 works great as expected with the Plug & Play setup so instructions are not really needed, however, they are included regardless. It also works with a variety of OS and devices making it very versatile storage device. It is HDD, not SDD but very silent compared to other external HDDs in the market. My last external HDD of one of the popular brand lasted about 7-8 years, so the only thing remains to be tested for this one is the durability and longevity.",
