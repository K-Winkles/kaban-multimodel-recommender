Not a solid state as my nifty new little T7 is. I could not be happier with the speed, size, function, reliability, packability, waterproofing, and overall superiority of the T7 product from what I have had in the past. It is light years ahead and a joy to use. The USB C is a delight, the color is lovely, and the price was very reasonable for 2 T as well. Thrilled with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I have several of these Samsung drives, and have found them to be rock solid in build quality, as well as supporting very fast data transfers. Unlike SSDs I own from another well-known brand, these barely get warm after transferring large amounts of data, which is reassuring. The Shield versions of the T7 drives are a bit larger in size compared with the standard versions, but this is due to their more robust construction and heat dissipation design.I use these for backups of various MacBook laptops we own, as well as storage of large media files. So far they've all worked flawlessly. It's important to use the cables that come with the drive (USB C-C and USB C-A) or their equivalent, as the transfer rate can be significantly slower with cheaper, run of the mill USB C cables.I like the feel of these in my hand, which may seem like a strange thing to say, but their ridges are easier to grab onto than the smoother aluminum finish on the standard version. This means it feels like I'm less likely to drop them. Smooth is nice and looks more sleek, but I think a more \"grippy\" surface is better when carrying your data around.Oddly enough, I was recently able to get a number of these drives for less money than the standard versions, which I was happy to take advantage of. I'm thinking some people might not prefer them because they are a bit bigger and less elegant looking, but they look that way for a reason. Physical robustness is more important than looks in a storage device.I think Samsung is one of the very best manufacturers of SSD drives right now, so I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for reliable data storage and very fast transfer rates.",

Very small and exceptionally fast, especially if you are used to the old HDs everyone is used to. Got this because I transfer a lot of video and some of it from an old, cranky Mac. This HD has made a huge difference in the speed needed for transfers and made the old Mac more usable. Nice, rubberized casing for a durable piece of equipment. Getting ready to transfer all of my external HD needs to SSDs because there are no moving parts, which, according to tech pros I have talked to, can only help in the long term.",
