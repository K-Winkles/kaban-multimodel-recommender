The shipping box was practically thrown to my front door. To be honest, I would purchase spinning drives at a brick-and-mortar store where you run one less risk of damage in transit (which is probably the biggest killer of drives). However, Amazon has an amazing RMA system, so here's hoping the new drive I receive is just as great as the working one I already own.The working drive works great. Nice transfer speeds for a spinner, and runs quietly.",

Ordered a 250GB Drive but received a 500GB drive which is probably great for some people. The problem is, I ordered 250GB for a reason, because larger Drives are less reliable -- that's just a fact. The sweet spot is 250GB, once you get to 1TB and higher the failure rate goes up.Thankfully the Drive was New inside an anti-static bag and worked without any hassle. I can't say the same about the SSD this replaced, SSD's are a hassle to set up and have issues with Motherboards that are just a few years old. SSD's are still too unreliable unfortunately.",

                "reviewText": "I put this in my Dell OptiPlex GX620, which was built in 2005. The original 80GB drive was filling up. I put the original drive in the 2nd bay, and now I use this new one for booting. This is the maximum size supported by this machine's motherboard. Dell would've charged me about $115 for a comparable Seagate drive, and I said effff that! :) I bought this from Amazon for about $49 in June 2013. It has been in use for two months now, and no problems at all!UPDATE: This drive finally died in 2019, having served me reliably throughout six years of heavy daily use! It was definitely a great value at the time at $49.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a professional software developer. Being also a careful shopper, I spent a long time researching hard drives for speed, reliability, and size. Frankly, it's easy to get overwhelmed. In particular, I became dismayed at the apparent poor reliability of many name-brand drives - often it appeared that up to 1 in 10 drives failed soon after purchase.I suspect Amazon has a problem with disgruntled buyers skewing review results. I don't doubt some drives do fail, but it's easy to imagine that these get reported with a much higher frequency than those that don't.In any event, I resisted spending more money for a \"more reliable\", \"higher performance\", \"higher capacity\" drive. The WD Blue 250 GB has been a delight. It's vastly quieter than my old Ultra320 Scsi 1500 rpm drive, and just as fast. As for size, 250 GB is plenty big for me since I backup to another drive and burn important stuff to disk as well.",
