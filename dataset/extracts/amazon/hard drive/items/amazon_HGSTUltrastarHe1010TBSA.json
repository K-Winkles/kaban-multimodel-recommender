They have been happy humming for a couple of months now and still, no issues whatsoever. Very fast, nice cache, reliable and quiet. The only irritation I have with them is that updating firmware is almost impossible. Not that there is any urgent need to do so, I just like to keep all my hardware on updated firmware and those drives make it even more user-unfriendly than it usually is with the Enterprise level drives. So it is just my quirk and a personal irritation with them - it doesn't reflect on well-deserved flying marks.",

                "reviewText": "So initially to test this drive i had connected it to one of those 'cord only' type of usb adapters, specifically mine is a Vantec CB-ISATAU2 SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter. It would work ok (you do have to first open up Disk Management in windows and setup the volume, format the drive, not a hard process but just as fyi it is not pre-formatted). you can do a very quick google on how to to that process again, its just a couple of clicks.so with this usb adapter i would find that sometimes the drive would be unavailable and would be difficult to get it to be recognized. This had me worried there was something wrong with the drive. But i also had a USB hard drive enclosure, an Inateck 3.5 Inch HDD Enclosure, USB 3.0 and with this device i've so far not had any issue.as with any drive old, new, refurbed, you can always get a lemon. as long as the company supports you with refund/replacement then the value seems pretty good - just remember redundancy is key for important data (i.e. backup to multiple places but local and cloud etc if possible)",
