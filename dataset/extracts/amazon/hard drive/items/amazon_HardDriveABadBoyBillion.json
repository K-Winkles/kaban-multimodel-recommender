Our heroine is attracted to him, but doesn't want to be another notch in his bedpost. Can they make the two views work together?This is a romance story, so of course they will figure it out, but the story is about the journey. Our hero has to woo the girl and come to realize a steady relationship is not a bad thing. And our heroine has to overcome her own feelings to inadequacy and accept herself for who she is. The result is a very nice HEA.This story is novella length, so a very reasonable commitment of time. I found the characters to be realistic in today's technology driven society, the story well written and fun to read.Highly recommended.NOTE: This review is based on the audio book version.",

With her friend judy the pair were funny and quick witted.The book is fast paced and the banter between gigi and Damien is funny and amazing. Only the fear of letting the other in is stopping them from happiness. Great read.",
