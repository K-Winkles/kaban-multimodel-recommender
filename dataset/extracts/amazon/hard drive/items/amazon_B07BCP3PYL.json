                "reviewText": "When I first bought a new laptop a few years ago, 237 GB of hard drive seemed like it would last forever. It wasn't until recent times when trying to install my latest purchase of Far Cry 6 only to discover it required a whopping 60GB of memory and the available space on the current internal hard drive was but a sliver in comparison. Even after deleting or uninstalling everything I truly didn't need, it still was not enough (Windows 10 itself is a memory hog), thus I had little choice except to buy a new computer or install a larger hard drive. A new laptop was economically out, especially when the current one was still running fine and I did not want to have to deal with installing another internal drive given the difficulty of placing one in even the larger confines of a desktop I had experienced years back.So, finding out external hard drives had now shrunk to a size where they wouldn't take up too much space on a desk and actually be portable, I purchase the Maxone Ultra Slim Portable and so far, I've not been disappointed.At about 4 1/2\" in length and 3 1/2\" in width, the Maxone is definitely svelte and very unobtrusive next to the computer itself (though I keep it behind it). It is simple plug and play and connects to any available USB port with a standard cable (though one came with it). At about 18\" the supplied cable is kind of short, but seeing as how one will likely have the drive close to the computer, that is not really an issue and as stated, any similar, longer cords would work just as well. It is small enough that I can fit it into my laptop case with both the computer and mouse if I need to access something on the external drive away from home.Installing said video game took almost the better part of the day, but I think it had more to do with the size of the program, as well as the Steam download speed and less to do with the hard drive itself. I imagine transferring standard files, like photos and such, should prove to be faster, but so far, I've only used the Maxone for the game as I still have room for everything else on the computer itself. The game ran fine on the Maxone and didn't crash once during the several weeks off and on it took me to complete it.Overall, I am satisfied with it and the value for the additional amount of memory. I will likely reserve the Maxone for downloaded games as until Moore's Law catches up with programs and gaming graphics, it will likely be enough additional memory for my needs or at least until the graphics card in the laptop itself can no longer run the latest games. Though I may also eventually use it to back up some important files as failing to do so in the past was a tragic lesson I do not wish to repeat and thus, the Maxone would also be good for redundancy storage and I may eventually purchase another one for just that purpose exclusively.",

                "reviewText": "Filled this up with Anime, TV and Movies, got about 60gigs left and it's been about a month. It's doin the thing well, I'm happy with it. The plastic on the edges does seem fragile, but I could care less about that. Only gripe is that it ends up only being 465gb to use.Edit: it's now Feb 25th, almost half a year of use, I've removed and added plenty, it's put through daily almost all day every day use and I have yet to have an issue, plan on getting a second 1tb and just keeping this one for just anime, great buy and a great price! Definitely been recommending this to people.Edit: it's now August 26th, I have noticed some videos not playing like they used to, this may be due to getting a second one and having them both plugged in and running and the same time (my laptop isn't the best) other than that all files are still there, they still play (though some Mkv files seem to have more artifacts, this could just be my laptop though)Feb 14th 2020, final edit: still works fine, no complaints.May 5th 2022, finalfinal edit: it's been years and years and it still works.Sept 18th 2022; I bought a second one, the first one still works, I just wanted one for my extended storage on the PlayStation.",

I have no complaints and haven't run into any issues trying to use it--it's simply just a plug and play external HDD. Some things to note, however:1. The hard drive uses a USB micro-B to USB-A cable, meaning that you won't be able to plug a regular USB-A or USB-C cable into the hard drive itself. This isn't a deal breaker, but if you lose the cable, I doubt you will have another one lying around.2. The hard drive is a hard drive. This isn't your premium external solid-state drive, so don't expect premium SSD speeds out of this drive. By no means is this HDD slow, but it isn't exactly fast either. For the price, however, this is about as good as it gets.Overall, I would absolutely recommend this drive to anyone looking for a simple, compact external HDD at a reasonable price.",

Et surtout fiables.Qu\u2019ils soient rapides \u00e9tait un plus, mais non indispensable.Mon commentaire est le m\u00eame pour les deux, puisque ce sont des mod\u00e8les identiques.Ce disque dur Maxone de 500 Go r\u00e9pond \u00e0 mes attentes, les d\u00e9passe m\u00eame.Arriv\u00e9 rapidement (une fois encore, merci Amazon prime).Le package comprend \u00e9galement un c\u00e2ble de 47 cm et une notice (en anglais)Format\u00e9 d\u2019origine en Exfat. Je me suis demand\u00e9 si je le conservais sous ce format ou si je le convertissais en Mac OS \u00e9tendu, puisque nous fonctionnons tous deux sous Apple. Finalement, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de conserver le format d\u2019origine puisque les ordis Apple lisent les deux formats, et que je pourrais \u00eatre amen\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9changer avec quelqu\u2019un qui travaille avec Windows (je ne pense pas, mais on ne sait jamais).Pr\u00e9sentation : \u00e9l\u00e9gant avec son bo\u00eetier en alu noir, bien fini, et surtout tr\u00e8s mince, ce qui est agr\u00e9able dans ma sacoche. Atout tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable qui s\u2019y rajoute : il ne p\u00e8se que 195 g. avec son c\u00e2ble. Il est solide : tomb\u00e9 une fois, sans aucune cons\u00e9quence (ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 faire, \u00e9videmment, mais lorsque cela arrive on est bien content que le mat\u00e9riel tienne le coup !).Fonctionnement : impeccable. Reconnu imm\u00e9diatement, il monte dans l\u2019instant sur le \u201cDesktop\u201d. Une petite diode bleue \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du port de branchement signale qu\u2019il est branch\u00e9 et en fonctionnement. Consommation impond\u00e9rable puisqu\u2019il est branch\u00e9 sur l\u2019ordinateur et aliment\u00e9 par celui-ci.Rigoureusement aucun bruit de fonctionnement (\u00e0 se demander si ce n'est pas un SSD !)Performances appr\u00e9ciables : tr\u00e8s rapide, bien qu\u2019il soit annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 5400 t/m, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la technologie USB-3. Bien entendu, un peu moins rapide en USB-2, mais c\u2019est li\u00e9 \u00e0 cette ancienne technologie, pas au disque dur ! Ceci dit, il fonctionne impeccablement tant en USB-2 qu\u2019en USB-3 : compatibilit\u00e9 parfaite.Ces disques durs seront-t-il r\u00e9sistants dans le temps ? Je ne sais \u00e9videmment pas. Mais le s\u00e9rieux de la fabrication domine. En quelques jours ils ont support\u00e9 chaque fois pr\u00e8s de 400 Go de fichiers images et vid\u00e9os, charg\u00e9s, transf\u00e9r\u00e9s, effac\u00e9s, \u00e0 11 reprises ; sans chauffer, \u00e0 peine ti\u00e8des apr\u00e8s le chargement du tout. Toujours aussi impeccables, bien que fonctionnant sur deux ordinateurs diff\u00e9rents (l\u2019un en MacOS Mojave (10.14), l\u2019autre en Mas OS Ventura (13).Au passage, \u00e0 savoir : test\u00e9 sur un PC portable sous Windows (je ne sais pas lequel) : il fonctionne tout aussi bien. C\u2019est donc (en plus) un excellent outil d\u2019\u00e9change de fichiers entre plateformes diff\u00e9rentes.Je recommande avec d\u2019autant moins d\u2019h\u00e9sitations que c\u2019est pour nous un outil de travail indispensable.",
