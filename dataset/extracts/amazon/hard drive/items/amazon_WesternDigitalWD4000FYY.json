        "description": "Western Digital 4TB WD4000FYYZ RE SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5\" Enterprise Hard Drive from WD is a powerful combination of enterprise-class performance and high capacity required for superior performance computing and business critical environments. The hard drive delivers transfer rates of up to 6 Gbps and high random I/O rates. It is coupled with a dual processor, which provides twice the processing power to maximize performance. The WD RE SATA Hard Drive's enhanced RAFF technology monitors the drive and corrects both linear and rotational vibration in real-time. It thus provides optimum performance even in high vibration environments. It features a head positioning system with two actuators which improves positional accuracy over the data track(s). The multi-axis shock sensor feature automatically detects the subtlest shock events allowing you to protect the data. The WD RE SATA Hard Drive's Time-Limited Error Recovery (TLER) feature prevents drive fall-out caused by the extended hard drive error-recovery processes. The NoTouch ramp load technology ensures that the recording head never touches the disk media. This allows significantly less wear to the recording head and media as well as enhanced drive protection in transit. Dynamic fly height technology enables each read-write head's fly height to be adjusted in real-time for optimum reliability. With 64 MB cache, the WD RE SATA Hard Drive ensures faster data transactions. It is ideal for use in servers, video surveillance and other demanding write-intensive applications demanding write-intensive applications. High Performance for Business Critical Applications The hard drive delivers transfer rates of up to 6 Gbps",

The install itself was as easy as plugging in the SATA cord and power. Your case determines how easy that is. Then secure the drive in your case. Literally less than 10 minutes for my case and it only took that long because I made the wires look nice.The drive works very well. It accesses quickly. The only slight complaint is the drive is somewhat noisy you will hear the clicking as it reads and writes. Part of that is the mounting in my case, part of that is the rest of the computer is almost silent. In a normal case and anywhere there are noisy or background drone from fans, you will not hear it in most instances.The storage capacity is excellent and I will buy at least one more for all the videos we produce.",

One batch got stuck on a FedEx belt somewhere in Orlando and arrived late and nonfunctional; had to reorder that batch (seller didn't offer replacement, just refund). Out of the other drives one died in less than a week... trying to work with the seller now.I ordered another batch a year or so ago and haven't had any trouble with those.",
