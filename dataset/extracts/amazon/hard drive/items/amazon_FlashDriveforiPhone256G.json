                "reviewText": "I was A bit hesitant to purchase something so compact for my devices, but I wanted to take the risk. This flashdrive is the most neatest thing I\u2019ve purchased thus far and I don\u2019t regret it. It holds up to 256gb of storage, the overview does mention that it\u2019s a 4-in-1 drive and couldn\u2019t determine if it will fit for my iPhone (13 pro). I\u2019m so happy that it does!! On the end for the computer slot of the drive, you have to carefully pull back a little piece of it for the tiny slot that works for newer model iPhones. Be careful when pulling it back. Installation was easy, color options are decent, and fast shipping. There\u2019s a free app you have to download in your Apple/Google Play Store for it to work correctly but other than that 10/10!",

                "reviewText": "** Updated Review **I decided to give this product another shot and buy another flash drive because there was a coupon and so many reviews were raving that I thought it might have just been the flash drive I received that was faulty. I received a new one and it worked very well at first (better than the first one) Now I go to use it a few weeks after and instantly had issues with my iPhone not recognizing the device anymore but I got my computer to access it so it was fine. I try again on different mobile devices and eventually, it starts working again only for my files to glitch and completely disappear .... now after going back in, thankfully a lot of the files are still there but there are countless files that now appear to be in the drive but I am unable to access them and they will not open. I am absolutely heartbroken to lose these files and regret trusting in the second device and that is my mistake. I would absolutely not recommend buying this product as it has now failed me twice and I have lost access to my important videos that I do not think I will be able to get back.Old Review:This product works pretty great at first but within my first night of installing stuff I already started to receive an \u201cerror\u201d message when trying to access items directly after putting them on the device. I am unable to access these items and they are still taking up storage on the device despite not being able to access them. When I attempted to delete the items it won\u2019t allow me and therefore is still taking up storage. I have been able to upload a few other items without this issue but now every time I try to upload something it does not work and I get the error message. Now I am worried it will get to the point where I am unable to access the other items as well.",
