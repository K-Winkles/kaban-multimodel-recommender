It is a WD Black 7200 RPM Drive with a MANUFACTURE DATE OF MARCH 2, 2015. The drive is advertised as being NEW and the ad also claims the drive has a 5 YEAR WARRANTY. I'm not sure who will be providing the warranty, but as long as it works for a week or two I'll be satisfied with it. The drive arrived in what appeared to be a factory static bag that was sealed with a big sticker warning about static discharge and potentially damaging the drive. The bag also had a 2nd sticker designed to be applied to a computer that shows the drive Part Number, Description and Serial Number as well as a bar code. The drive and static bag were placed into a blown plastic shock absorbing molded plastic packing material and installed at each end of the drive, then placed into a really heavy duty cardboard box with a label on the end showing the Part number, serial number and the word NEW in all Caps. The shipping label was affixed to this really heavy duty box and sent to me. The box arrived in great shape, and the drive also appeared new. I placed it into an external enclosure and connected it to my Linux system via USB 3 connector and was able to put a partition on it, format it and copy about 100GB of data to it a few times without any issues. The drive is super quiet and clean. For the price, it appears to be a bargain at this point and as long as it makes it through the first 30-90 days past the infant mortality range of time, I think it will be a long lasting drive. My only question is who is providing the warranty on the drive since it is already 8 years old and probably just old NEW OEM stock. Time will tell , but for the moment I 'm satisfied with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I had enough scares with consumer grade drives... Had failures of green drives... in testing... complete junk... only put on a green drive stuff your ok losing !!!I opted for this drive WD4000FYYZ actually quite a few of them... in a RAID they are very very quick... if you use raid 5 (minimum 3 drives) You will lose only one drives capacity to parity (3 X 4Tb drive will ONLY = 8Tb of RAID 5 storage actually less after formatting) BUT the loss of capacity is in exchange for the safety and security of SINGLE DRIVE FAILURE fault tolerance... meaning one drive can fail and the integrity of your information is maintained... at $300 per drive that is a hefty price to pay... but so is the price of data recovery service... and its expensive to have a hospital to restart your heart when you think all your data is lost... forever... with that in mind these drives look more and more attractive... also if you RAID \"consider\" if you have a controller card failure or power supply failure that's also an issue... for maximum safety... you need redundancy of those items as well to limit your overall exposure from potential data loss emanating from failures of these sources as well...Can your data ever be 100% safe... NO... but you can limit the possibility of loss to a very low acceptable level... burn your most critical information to optical disk or buy another HDD and put in a safety deposit box just in case your house burns down or floods... also a great enclosure like the QNAP Pro Series or equivalent since that is just as important as the quality of the drives... themselvesGreen Drives - are junk, take my word... spin the wheel and take your chancesRed Drives - I have no experience with so I offer no opinionBlack Caviar Drives - I have had many and can not recall a failure... EVER... better Price per MB of storage than Enterprise Class with excellent reliability... it would be far safer IMO to Mirror 2 of these drives then have 1 Enterprise Class Drive that's something to consider in your pockets are not bottomless !!!Enterprise Class - when only the best is good enoughBackground former Senior Systems Engineer with EMC Corporation so I am probably dispensing reasonable information... I hope I helped someone from losing information that's not easy to replace... Good Luck...",
