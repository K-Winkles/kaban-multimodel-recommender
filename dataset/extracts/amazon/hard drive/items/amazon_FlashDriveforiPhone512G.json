It is easy to use. You have to plug it into your phone and then download the app. Then you have to go to your settings and find the memory stick in your general/about settings. It has created a ton more free space on my phone so now it can back up. The memory you get for the price is GREAT. 1 TB will hold so much and I'm so thankful that I took my chance on this memory stick. If you have been debating on getting one then I will say, it won't be a mistake and will serve many purposes. 5 of 5!",

My only issue, and why I gave this four stars, was with the directions that came with it. The font is so small even for someone that has good eyesight.

Each of those products have a different type of port, this one Flashdrive can be used with all three types. It is small, attractive and it comes in different colors. Also, it is packaged in a protective little lined tin and the tin is ensconced in a small ziplock plastic baggie. I love the protective forethought (from moisture and shock). I work in construction indoors and outdoors. I don\u2019t have to worry about my little Flashdrive getting damaged if I forget about it in my pocket.",

Not to mention the fact that since it's a true 1TB of storage, I was able to copy ALL my important documents on my MacBook, my ENTIRE music collection AND all DVD's that I've collected through the years. THis is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone needed extra storage space. :)",

One would think a small task of inserting a USB would be easy, but it has not proven to be. I was excited to receive it in the mail, but I'll be packing it right up to send back.

How in the world would you be able to figure out what files they were? Got totally frustrated and then read the 1 star reviews (should have done that before ordering it). It performed exactly as all the other reviews of the 1 star. Actually, it should be 0 stars. Don\u2019t purchase and save yourself the aggravation. On the plus side glad we tried this out prior to going on our trip as we would have been so upset. Our travel videos are too important to lose due to a faulty device.
