                "reviewText": "Overall the experience was good. I did not lose any files. For iPhone users, the drive requires an app to function and access photos. That part is a little bothersome in that it has to run through the app, but I think it states the app does not collect or store data. The backup is super fast for videos and photos. This may be because it converts the video to an *.Mov file. This file format can be viewed on a PC using freeware software called VLC media player and other compatible software. I viewed a few videos after I transferred them to the PC and they pulled up just fine and in good quality. In all, it backed up about 60GB of movie files on the iPhone in about 1.5 hours. It would be nice if the description and process was more clear before I purchased it and if there were some better instructions and descriptions that came with the drive. The process felt a little questionable given the unknowns of the app and all the negative reviews but my experience was good and I am happy with the results and the overall value.",
