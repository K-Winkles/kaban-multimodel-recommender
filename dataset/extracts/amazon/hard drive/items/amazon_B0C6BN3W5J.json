I\u2019m consolidating data from many other drives.Initially, I was concerned due to a few bad reviews on other items from this company. However, the five-year warranty backed by the company selling these drives, plus the fact I was buying a spare, helped me make the decision.I installed four drives into the raid system; they spun up with no errors, and the raid system built a 48TB volume. The software monitoring the drive status continues to report no issues with the drives.I am very happy with this purchase because of the price and definitely purchase more drives in the future.",
