                "reviewText": "It took me about 15 minutes to set the drive up (I have learned to be very ODC with any computer hardware installation over the last35 years). I plugged it in, did something else for maybe 30 seconds and looked... the power/usage light was on. Downloaded Backup Software, Revisions History and Manual with ease from the link supplied on the new HDD.After a couple of false starts (I had folders with Admin Only access), it is now dutifully backing up the internal SSI of my Laptop (now at 23% after 8 minutes to give you an idea of its speed).It is the easiest external HDD add I've ever done (except maybe my previous 1.0TB Toshiba that was stolen) by far. Could NOT have been simpler. Just follow the already loaded directions. Buy this one! (Toshiba Canvio Slim) without hesitation. Pass on cheaper ones. They're not that much cheaper and you'll pay for it over time. I had my previous Toshiba 1.0TB (earlier version obviously) for at least 6 or 7 years and it never faltered. Not once!After this glowing recommendation, keep in mind that I can be very tough on reviews if the product is marginal. If fact, I rated this as only 4 stars for Service (because I have NEVER needed to use it :) ) and Storage Capacity (only because 5.0TB HDD's are available now, that's why the price has dropped so dramatically... \"Old Technology\". I think this was about $70-$80 only less than six months ago, I paid $53).If you need more storage, you absolutely cannot miss with this choice!",

The only thing that frustrates me is is that Toshiba doesn\u2019t provide anti slip feet on their hdds anymore. Very happy with this though. Way Better build structure than all other big brands with regard to casing quality. In today\u2019s time I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m used to garbage quality at this point.",
