                "reviewText": "Love the flexibility this product offers, I'm able to plug it into Phone, iPad, or PC and preserve the quality of the photos.I'm at a point of confusion and a bit of frustration but I'd still recommend this to others as it's portable, convenient and serves its main purpose.Please approach the rest of commentary with the understanding that I'm very new to photo storage and upgraded from Google photos to this toshiba hard drive to preserve my raw photos. I have minimal understanding of hard drive technology and specs.My challenge is.....data transfer takes a lot longer than I anticipated/hoped.It's excruciatingly slow trying to open, view, and organize photos on my iPad. So much so that on an 11 hour flight, I wasn't able to accomplish anything.It's faster with my laptop, which makes sense to this non tech expert. That being said, it's still really pretty slow and laggy when reading it. Transfer of photos from SD card to hard drive took a pretty long time, I did it in 2 phases, maybe 30 gb each time. Would love to figure out the math on what I should expect that transfer to take, maybe my expectations were too high.I don't know anything about specs, I wish I had before I bought and wish I did now. I assumed that if it can STORE 2TB of data, that it should have no problem reading 74 gb worth of items at a fair speed so I can organize them into folders. As I simply view them on my laptop, It also doesn't seem to keep them loaded as I scroll down, and it is an arduous process to group them.Maybe I'm meant to transfer the photos to the computer first and look at them there, and then transfer them back? Is that how to make this work better? I'll be doing some research in my spare time.Biggest complaint - if it is such a difficult task to open up and load all the photos at once in the main folder where they default, can there be an easier way to group them into separate folders to reduce this pain point? Maybe an auto folder based on date, or all photos from 5000-6000 in one. Maybe I'll look into a software that organizes them as this is painful. I don't know if it is possible to organize the photos ahead of time from the SD card before transferring when on the go - or if I should just rethink my process all together.Other context - I've confirmed my laptop processing capabilities are not the issue, it is the specs of the hard drive (confirmed by tech support from laptop team).

This one is still going and provides a lot of storage for the space it takes up on your desktop (and the price you pay). Although I\u2019ve had zero problems with it, my experience with other external drives (none by this manufacturer) tells me not to trust any external drive as the only place you store things that are important to you. Just sayin\u2019\u2026But drives like this are great for retrieving the document you inadvertently deleted yesterday. Also, the USB-C connectivity is great for use with recent computers, which use that standard..",
