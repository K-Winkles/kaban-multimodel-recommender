                "reviewText": "Apple charges too much to add storage. So, I got my MAC with standard 512gb of storage. I added this Western Digital Black SN770 2TB with an Acasis external NVMe enclosure and I couldn't be happier. External drives, including NVMe over Thunderbolt max out at 2700-2800 MBps. So there was no reason for me to buy the higher speed and more expensive NVMe storage. But with overhead, you don't want an NVMe that only gets around 3000MBps either. This was perfect. It's almost as fast as my internal storage. Internal clocks at around 3000-3100MBps read/write. This enclosure with the SN770 2TB clocks in consistently at 2750-2800MBps. Can't beat it.Some people say these NVMe, like most, run hot. Well, if you know what you're doing, it doesn't run hot. Put the thermal pad on properly and it works fine. I keep mine running even cooler by having this enclosure sitting next to my Mac Mini M2 Pro, which I have sitting on TOP of a laptop fan/cooler. When I run temps on this enclosure and the western digital SN770 NVmw, it averages around 85-88 degrees F when idling. If I let my Mac go to sleep when I walk away, the temp when it comes out of sleep mode is around 78 degrees F. When I'm using the enclosure and SN770, the temperature rarely goes about 100 degrees F. Unless I am playing a game, (I store all my games on this drive). It might reach around 110-120 degrees F. Under the harshest conditions, maybe 130 degrees. The operating temperature of most M.2 NVMe is 0 - 70\u00b0C (32 - 185\u00b0F). So definitely no problem. This enclosure is small, so it fits nicely on the laptop fan/cooler, along with my Mac Mini M2 Pro and USB-C hub and USB-A (3.0) hubs.I got this enclosure on sale for about $95. Normally around $120-$130. I got the Western Digital SN770 2TB M.2 NVM3 for $85; normally $100-$120. Apple wants $200 for an ADDITIONAL 512GB of storage. Doing it this way, I got an additional 2TB of storage for a total of $180. And it's just as fast as the internal Mac storage. Definitely recommend this Western Digital SN770 storage. But you have to pair it with a quality enclosure if you're not buying it for internal PCIe. If you are getting an external enclosure, get the Acasis TBU405. Great price, great speed. No need to spend more for faster. It can't go faster. Only internal PCIe can go faster. Don't try and save $10-$20 by getting some other brand. Stick with Western Digital or Samsung.",

It purports to be faster than my original drive as well, but I wasn't able to compare them to verify that.The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is that I'm having occasional unknown errors/failures that cause my laptop to have to reboot now. The drive seems to check out so it may be something else, but the problem only started after replacing the drive, so I'm still suspicious that there might be an issue with it.",
