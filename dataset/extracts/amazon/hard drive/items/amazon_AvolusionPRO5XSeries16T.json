                "reviewText": "I am impressed with the performance of this drive and it is also quiet for a spinning disk. No problems formatting to full capacity.Reviewers seem confused as to why Windows claims the formatted capacity is 14.5TiB vs the 16TB advertised capacity with some thinking it is formatting overhead and such but it isn't. Manufacturers and some operating systems like macOS use decimal counting where 1000 kilobytes (KB) is 1 megabyte (MB). Windows uses binary counting where 1000 kibibytes (KiB) = 1 Mebibyte (MiB).Simply manufactures and macOS measure in terabytes, Windows uses tebibytes. 16 TB = 14.55 TiB. It is the same capacity, just measured in different units.",

The downside, it needs to be plugged in and makes quite a bit of noise when writing. Otherwise, decent storage capacity for the price and fairly fast writing speed.",

Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I felt like I would give this unit a try due to the cost per terabyte and a fairly nice looking form factor based on the pictures.I was pleasantly surprised when getting this together and setup. I did a test comparison with CrystalDisk and this unit was around 40% faster read/write speeds than my Seagate Firecuda Gaming Hub. Both of them are 7200 RPM drives, but was very happy with the performance.My avg read speed was 283.96 and my avg write speed was 280.67.",

Normally I'm not going to format a hard drive doing a surface scan of a 16TB hard drive - it takes more than a day. However since my experience with this brand was zilch, it got the surface scan while formatting the drive and it seemed to fail - twice. No biggie. I sent it back and instantly got a refund (or maybe a credit). Hopefully this was an aberration. Do yourself a favor - scan the disk. If this was an not aberration perhaps we'll roll the dice again. Give the company another chance.",
