This one is replacing a 5 year old 1TB 7200 RPM Barracuda in my Linux server. Absolutely nothing wrong with that drive (in fact I'm giving it to a friend), I just needed more space. Since I'm using it in a server, and this drive is the exact same price as the 4TB Barracuda Pro, I decided on the NAS drive since it's better optimized for what I'm using the server for (mostly network storage). It was a breeze to set up once I figured out how to do GPT/UEFI under Linux (not difficult, I had just never done it before so needed to read some instructions first). Everything is working beautifully so far.",

Working great, so far. Absolutely quiet. In fact, when I first installed it, I had to put my hand on it to verify it was even running, that's how quiet it is. Now, if it will last as long as the WD Black drives it replaced, I'll be a happy camper.",
