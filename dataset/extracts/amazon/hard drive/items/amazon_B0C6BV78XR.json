Original review: I purchase these refurb drives as a cheap way to back up my entire home business desktop system for off-site storage. Multiple backups exist so this is not 100% critical or under heavy repeated use in my case but I do need them to work if I lose my system for some reason. I've had good luck with one refurb drive from Amazon but the one received on this date (20TB size MDD Enterprise Drive says the label, no idea what's actually inside) would only click and clack oddly and never spin up to mount on my desktop (not visible in Disk Utility on Mac either). I'm letting Amazon send another one with their fairly painless return process and will try again (returning the defective drive of course). You can't beat the price but they do have to work.",
