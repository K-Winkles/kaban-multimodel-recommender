                "reviewText": "This drive is pretty cool when it comes to speed (my max was ~1GB/s) and the physical footprint of the drive being pretty small. I would have given this drive a five-star rating except one thing; using this drive initially was a pain... my device did not recognize the SSD, and I was unable to find it using the disk manager through Windows 10. After fiddling with the cable the drive was finally recognizable but was not able to transfer any data. I then tried another Type c to USB cable and the drive worked perfectly. With this said, the two cables that are provided in the Box (a type c to type c and a type c to USB A) are able to transmit power to the SSD but not able to transfer any data (Windows 10 prompting with an error when trying to load the drive). This was not much of a problem for myself because I have extra cables lying around. For the average user however, having these two provided cables not work properly can be of an inconvenience and lead to them buying a separate cable. Aside from the cables not working properly, like I mentioned above, the drive is very fast and I am able to game off it. While using the SSD it does get warm but this is normal. After moving a lot of data it does get pretty hot to touch but cools off rather quickly. It is best to leave the drive exposed to the open air when using it and not have it under anything or surrounded by other objects. Overall this is a great drive. I would say this is great for the money however I bought this when it was on sale, and it was a great buy at the sale price. For the non-sale price however, it can be a little expensive when compared to competitors like Samsung, but when compared to brand named gaming SSDs, this is a great alternative.",

                "reviewText": "My Mac was very slow and not shutting down and I bought it as a startup SSD. This is not plug-and-play. It needs configuration. I am no expert and had a few days of struggle. I find it very confusing that Q&A says will not work for Mac and says described in the ad. It is wrong. This SSD works. The start time gets much faster from 10-15 minutes to 1-2 minutes. This is good enough for me. Disk speed is advertised up to 1000 mb/s; actual 550-850 write, 850 read. It has frozen a few times. I do not know how long this SSD lasts.Overall it is fast. It solved many of my problems.To install, there are several steps you need to be careful. I followed Apple community and MacWorld review, both lack some details. The manual did not help me how to partition the disk, but I recommend to read the manual for the rest. I have to go back to the Apple community to partition. My memory is somewhat vague but here is what I did:1. Connect it to the computer. Icon showed up and could be opened (but I could not save a file).2. Go to Disk Utility and format SSD with GUID. Specifics are in step 3 next. A few key points:- Make sure you are looking at DIsk. My default was to show \"volume\" and I format it and gave me an error, \"the disk is locked.\" I had to change the setting to view the Disk and Volume in the Disk Utility. Then I format it and it worked.3. In the Disk Utility, click \"Erase (this is \"formatting\" and the term was confusing). Type:- Name: You name the disk you want- Format: macOS Extended (Journaled)- Partition: GUIDName, Format and Partition show up at the same time. If you are looking at Volume, partition would not show up. Make sure you are \"erasing (formatting)\" the Disk but not the Volume. I did not notice I was looking at the volume and I was so frustrated that the partition did not allow me to choose GUID. I had to repeat the step several times to figure it out.4. Press \"OK\" or could be \"Apply.\" Do not remember.5. After finishing formatting, install macOS or restore using Time Machine. You can do it by pressing \"command+R\" when starting the Mac. The choice should show up.6. When starting, press \"option\" and choose your SSD.7. Mac should start up from your SSD.From my experience, I would recommend a faster connection Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C. My WB disk has 4tb with usb; I think it is usb3.0 that looks rectangular. It is extremely slow. I went for ~1000 MB/s over 500 MB/s because I worried about the speed. You could go over 2000 MB/s if you choose Thunderbolt 3.",
