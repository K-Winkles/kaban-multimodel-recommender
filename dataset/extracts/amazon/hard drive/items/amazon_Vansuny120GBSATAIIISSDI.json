                "reviewText": "This a decent 480 GB solid state drive for the price. It is a good amount of of spaces and it can pretty much hold the operating system as well as several programs. Even thought it a good amount of space, it will fill up fast if you have tons of photos or videos.. In terms of speed, it is good if you are on a budget or just want to upgrade an older computer/laptop with a solid state drive. It is the same physical size as a 2.5 drive and in similar aluminum casing as many other SSD. It is thinner than your usual 2.5 disk drive but that is because there is no mechanical piece. That being said, it is REALLY scratched prone. It works for both Mac and PC without any issues. It will detect on most motherboards (I have yet to see one that does not detect it) I did not need to install any additional software and it was just a plug in play. I use this for my mac mini and it has a decent boot up (but not the best). As always, the drive need to be initialized before it can be used. This can all be done in the installation window. I did a memory verification just to be safe and the storage memory is correct so you can be sure your data is safe. When plugging it into my computer and doing a speed test on the device, it did pretty well in terms of read and write speed. There was no huge discrepancy to be alarmed if you are just trying to get a better boot speed. When I tried this with my MAC and it ran pretty well to say the least. It did not have any issues with connection or installation for any of the operating systems (even linux). I ran with this solid state drive and boot up was pretty good. It is not as fast as an m2 drive but it still pretty quick. It is not the best speed, but decent if you are looking to maybe upgrade an older computer or just want a spare SSD for other purposes. I actually used this on my parents desktops as they still ran on disk drive and it worked for them. They liked the faster boot up. I tested the drive on both mac and windows and windows seem to show a faster speed than mac. I honestly do not know why this is. Overall this is a good solid state if you are on a budget or just want to upgrade an older drive. It has a good amount of memory. The write/read speed is not bad and it works pretty well. It boots up my operating system without much issue. The SSD memory (in my opinion) the minimum you should have for most computers which is just some basic software and storage. For day to day use, this is a good choice for a cheaper price. If you are looking for something for gaming, this drive will work but 480 gb is going to get filled up pretty quick with game sizes these days. Also supports drive cloning if you have the right software.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 of these drives back in November. Around that time obviously SSD's were newly-dirt-cheap and there was a lot of impulse buying of PC parts I could put to use when I had time for the projects. I immediately plugged one into my PC and initialized it to use for storage.. great!5 months later (I had even ordered a crucial SSD drive too in December that I let sit for 60 or so days as well) I plug the second drive in to initialize it - nothing. This drive had set on my shelf, in it's box, preserved inside of yet another storage container with all my backup SSDs/HDDs. I go through the motions - cloning software, different PC's, tried it on a MacBook with internet recovery, tried it with paid recovery/partitioning software - it's a dead drive. So I'm sitting here with a paperweight that came new out of the box from this company. I send an email to this company asking what my options are and if there's any sort of manufacturers' warranty for DOA products that goes outside of Amazon's 30 day.Nothing, they're ghosting me. Not even to let me know that \"no, we sent you a product that doesn't work out of the box but since its outside of the 30-day we'll keep your money and you can keep that DOA drive.So many SSD's are affordable and have great customer service backing them now. Don't take a chance on these cheap no-name company drives, you'll get what you pay for and there won't be anything resembling customer service.",

Consuma meno energia rispetto ai tradizionali dischi rigidi, contribuendo a prolungare la durata della batteria del mio laptop. Infine, il rapporto qualit\u00e0-prezzo di questo SSD \u00e8 eccezionale.
