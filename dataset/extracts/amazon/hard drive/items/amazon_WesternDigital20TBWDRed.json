                "reviewText": "I just installed 2 x 14TB Red Pro in my NAS to replace the smaller 4TB Red Plus I had. The drives were easily installed and detected properly in my system with flawless performance so far. While I've read some reviews expressing concerns about the noise generated by this drive, I wanted to share my experience when compared to the WD Red Plus drives. The WD Red Pros do make a much louder start up sound where you wonder if the drives are struggling to spin up, but after a couple minutes, it quiets back down. There was a night where it just kept making that loud noise, but like others have mentioned, this is a mechanical drive, so some noise is a given. Compared to the WD Red Plus the noise is much louder, but when I step out of the room the drives are in, you can't hear it at all.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Gold which I was/am very happy with, so this review compares the two. The drives are currently in the same machine, so I can compare real world performance.By the spec sheet, the only difference between the Red Pro and Gold is the MTBF. In my machine side by side, I've found that to be very untrue. The Gold is quieter and noticeably faster. They're all on the same SATA III controller. Gold gets 50 MB/s faster transfer when past the write cash. That's 20% which is a pretty big difference for a drive that's claimed by the manufacturer to be \"the same\" spec. for write.The Red Pro is very loud. Much louder than the Gold. In my Fractal case, the drive has so much torque that it rattles around in the HDD cage. Sounds like a woodpecker. A terrifying racket if your data is important. This is partly a product of Fractal's proprietary mounting system, but other drives didn't rattle. Fortunately, the Fractal case has alternate places to mount it, so I was able to put a stop to that.For the price I got them at, I would still buy again. But I would have liked to know that: yes these are not as good as the Gold in every dimension.",
