Very handy, slick, and perfect for travel too.The only negative: In the pictures it is shown attached to a MacBook using a USB-C to USB-C cable, but the cable in the box is USB C to A. So I haver to use an adapter on it. Bummer! The 2tb came with a C to C cable.",

And it works. What more do you need? I don't know if it's encryption-capable. Haven't tried nor will i ever. It's not going to be used for any stolen classified information.

I did buy the exact drive somewhere else so this should work. Because It's an SSD drive, it is very fast, small and light. No external power source needed. It has a USB-C interface and connects directly to my laptop. I'm using it with a Mac so a simple reinitialize was necessary. It has a small rubber tab to add a clip or lanyard if you want to carry it with (or to manage the cable as I did). Since there are no moving parts, it is super quiet, like no sound what-so-ever. That fact should also help with the longevity of this drive.",

I prefer working with an encryption file format that I already know rather than the encryption software that comes pre-loaded.I've been so impressed that I bought a second one!A nice thing is that it's plug and play with my Samsung Note 20 (no encryption for that but I can move photos and videos, or whatever right to the drive and clear up the phone's storage). This is my plan for the second drive. I wish it were possible to save right to the drive as I took pictures, as this might be nice on occasion (e.g., during a special event) but that doesn't appear to be an option. Still, it's a nice way to keep the phone storage free by downloading every so often on the road.I appreciate the small size and big storage (I got the 2 Terabyte versions).Look forward to seeing how they perform over time. It makes me feel good that SanDisk is owned by Western Digital, as I've relied on their drives for years and never had any problems.",

I have tried many others and they either break down on me in a short period or they are just flimsy and made of cheap materials. This product is sturdy and robust and I have dropped it many times and it keeps ticking. I am glad that SanDisk decided to make a line of external SS drives that are catered to rough and \"clumsy people\" like myself since I am always on the go and this item gives me the confidence that I would not lose anything data or that it would just spontaneously break down on me like some others I have had. The built is SOLD and it doesn't feel delicate like the other external SSDs I have had. So far, I have purchased 5 of these SSDs from SanDisk (beginning 6 years ago) - and so far so good!",
