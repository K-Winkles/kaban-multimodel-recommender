                "reviewText": "This drive crashed out of the blue, after a year, used only 6 times for Time Machine back-up for my Mac book pro. Although I had a back up to this drive (crazy to need a back up to a back up but a must), unfortunately there was one extra folder that I had not backed up. Long story short.... it ultimately cost me $1200. to retrieve that folder (company in San Diego). There is absolutely no personal support from Western Digital. No one with whom to communicate. Their website is NOT friendly. One would think that a company selling digital hardware in the USA, would have a user friendly support website, but it does NOT. Different passwords for each different product, instructions poorly worded. After retrieving documents from the drive, I returned the drive to WD (to Calexico, on border with Mexico, 97 miles away from San Diego). In detailed report, I asked for monetary reimbursement. No response from WD. Today, I received a replacement drive and cable in a box, in the mail, no other paperwork. Its probably a refurbished drive. I do not trust this product. It will probably crash in short order. Be sure to back up anything you put on this drive. It is not to be trusted. I have spoken with many techs. This drive is not to be trusted.",

                "reviewText": "A fast, compact drive powered by its USB-C connector. A solidly built cable is included plus a USB-A converter. There's a single activity LED near the connector.Write performance on a USB-C 3.1 host interface was decent, with 1MB sequential writes running at 112MiB/s, but dropping to 94MiB/s presumably along the slower (outer) parts of the spinning disk.Linux/BSD people, here's how the drive showed up for me:WD My Passport 260D 2007 Fixed Direct Access SPC-4 SCSI device1907697MB (3906963456 512 byte sectors)Note the enclosure shows up as a separate device, BSD sees it as:ses1: WD SES Device 2007 Fixed Enclosure Services SPC-4 SCSI deviceses1: SES DeviceUSB-C is a selling point for me despite some skeptical reviewers here. It isn't meant to be faster, necessarily, that's a function of the interfaces on each end. But it's always a more robust & simpler connector. It lasts long than microUSB (by design) and doesn't need to be flipped back and forth repeatedly until it finally fits. I generally won't buy a device with an older USB connector unless there's no option. USB-C all the way.A great little drive, and nice-looking too. I might wish it were SSD or that the LED was on the front, but otherwise no complaints.",

However, all that changed for me when it came to Macbook. 3 years ago I switched from Windows to Mac. After trying a few other cheaper un-named as well as name brands, this WD external drive has been extremely stable for my MacBook. For me, that means it has been an acceptable speed with constant connection. I do wish it was faster, but the fact it has never stopped responding and has never mysteriously disconnected means a world of difference to me. So to me, this item is like a well-trained marathon runner. For me, it does not have to be the fastest runner out there but it does need to still have strength left when it gets past the finish line. I just may need it to run an even bigger file next.",

None of them are going to last forever and the one that no longer works is extremely old so I figure it just wore out. The problem I have is there was no warning of it starting to fail, it just gave out all at once and I lost a lot of important documents, so now I have to find a way to get the drive to work to pull the information off, but since I know how to do so I'm not too concerned, but 99.5%+ of people won't be able to do such a thing without paying a hefty penny for a professional to do it so there's that. But for what it is, they have held up very well and I continue to buy them since I have not found another suitable at this price range. Just make sure you backup your MOST important stuff twice, maybe clown the HD to another once you have permanent setup so that it's double backed up and just use one for whatever while the other sits somewhere safe.",
