                "reviewText": "It is incredibly easy to use. Plug it in and go. I don't really have many large files (video, etc), so 320G gives me plenty of space. I backed up everything on the main laptop I use (we have around 5-6 computers in the house all the time, for different purposes), and everything backed up, mostly not compressed, took up only 1/3 of the space.It was very cheap compared to the usage I'm getting.I highly recommend it unless you want to store a lot of videos",

First, it wouldn't accept anything in a folder so I tried to add my files separately. That in itself totally messed me up since my files were now scattered all over the external drive and hard to find. Then it would accept some files and not others. Finally, I just said to hell with it, erased everything I put on it, and started fresh again and I'm still having problems! Now it's telling me that it can't read some of my files that it had accepted before. Won't be buying this product again.",
