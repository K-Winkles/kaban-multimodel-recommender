However, it does not deliver the promised performance. AT BEST it provided 600MB/s SEQUENTIAL read & write speeds if connected directly on the computer's USB-C (USB4/Thunderbolt (40Gb/s)) port. Using the hub I had access to (I had access to three of them), it delivered HALF (~300MB/s).It's compact & usable. Still, I'm returning it because at 2TB I need better performance as I expect to have it around for several years. And with future upgrades & workloads, this device will likely become a bottleneck (esp. as it gets closer to being filled).",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe mir die SSK SSD 2 TB zum black friday Preis von knapp 110 \u20ac geholt und bin absolut begeistert. Ausgepackt, angeschlossen und los ging's. Ich verwende sie um Xbox series x Spiele zwischenzuparken und der Transfer l\u00e4uft mega schnell. Das Laufwerk ist ultra klein, so wie es auch in der Anzeige zu sehen ist. Ich w\u00fcrde von der Marke immer wieder Produkte kaufen. \u00dcber die Langlebigkeit kann ich bis jetzt nicht sagen, aber bei mir l\u00e4uft sie jetzt knappe drei Wochen und ich hatte noch keine Probleme.",
