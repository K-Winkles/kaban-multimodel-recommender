        "description": "WD AV drives consume less power by up to 40 percent compared to 7200 RPM hard drives. Lower power means less heat and greater reliability. The drive arm frequently sweeps across the disk to reduce uneven wear on the drive surface common to audio video streaming applications. A fine-tuned balance of spin speed, transfer rate, and caching algorithms designed to deliver both significant power savings and solid performance. (3.5-inch models only) Leading edge technology delivers improved video quality and AV performance through enhanced error correction capability. (EURS/EURX/AUDX/xxCT models only) Recommended use: Set-top boxes (PVR, DVR, NVR and IPTV), media servers and media centers.",

                "reviewText": "They KNOW these are not merely BULK drives, which come with a lesser warranty of 1 year.Fact is that out of two drives, one failed to even register and the other which was the 1st's replacement, had to be reworked with Hiren's DOS program tools for hard drive resurrection to even show, it was defective and would not register in Windows 10 drive manager either.These are what are called \"customer culled\" items which were a bad run at Western Digital, and then bought cheaply in a bulk sale. That does not make these a BULK drive item. It makes it a defective drive culling operation where the customer culls the bad ones out to even get a good one.Amazon honors the replacement but the question is since it is fulfilled by Amazon, why do they allow it to go on, selling defectives to merely cull out the bad ones?",

                "reviewText": "Over many years of building my own desktop computers, I have tried a few different brands of hard drives, but the most reliable by far are WD drives. I cannot say that this drive is better than the WD drive I replaced, but in general, that is a good thing. I plan to use the old, smaller drive in another computer I am building for a relative. - Unpaid endorsement (but if WD wants to give me something for it, I'll take it.) :-)",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this hard drive to replace the original 320Gb Seagate hard drive inside my Humax Foxsat-HDR Freesat+ recorder. The product is now installed and has been working fine for nearly a week. However, I initially experienced problems with the installation, which I now realise to have been due to the need to place a 'jumper' over pins 5 and 6. I didn't know about this requirement when I first installed it though. It seemed to be working fine for a couple of days but then a fault developed - when I switched the Foxsat-HDR on, it would fail to recognise the new internal hard drive and no recording was possible, nor could I get access to my stored TV programme recordings. I would then switch the machine off and then on again and usually it would then recognise the drive, but then fail to recognise it the next time again.As a result, I had to uninstall the new hard drive and I sought advice about the cause of the problem, which eventually led to me going to a local computer repair shop and obtaining a jumper. I admit I didn't know anything about jumpers up to this point. I also managed to somehow place the jumper on the wrong two pins (because I wasn't quite sure which way was up and which way was down in order to recognise which were the correct pins to place the jumper on!). This meant that after I reinstalled the new drive, the fault was still there.However, I eventually uninstalled it again and placed the jumper on the correct two pins and then reinstalled it and I'm glad to say that it now appears to be working fine. Hopefully by posting this message, others will save themselves an awful lot of time and hassle by checking beforehand whether or not they also need to obtain a jumper and place it on particular pins for whatever they intend to use it for. I don't know whether or not the jumper usually needs to be fitted, but I know it was definitely needed in order for it to work correctly in the Humax Foxsat-HDR, something to do with the 6Gb/sec speed of the drive, I understand. It would have been quite useful if a jumper was included as standard with the product at the time of purchase, along with some written information.",
