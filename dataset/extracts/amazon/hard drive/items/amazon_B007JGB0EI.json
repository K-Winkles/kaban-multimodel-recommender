        "description": "Looking for an effortless way to secure your data while taking advantage of the fastest USB 3.0 speeds? Look no further than the Aegis Padlock 3.0. Featuring your choice of AES-XTS 128-bit or 256-bit hardware encryption the Aegis Padlock 3.0 seamlessly encrypts all data on the drive in real-time, keeping your data safe even if the hard drive is removed from its enclosure. With a super speed USB 3.0 interface, you can now access your files faster than ever before. The Aegis Padlock 3.0 is also backwards compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1 ports. With no software installation required for setup or operation and the ability to run on any platform, the Aegis Padlock 3.0 provides stress free deployment in corporate environments. The Aegis Padlock 3.0 also employs a useful drive reset feature, which can be implemented with a unique command. This clears all PINs and data, and creates a new randomly generated encryption key, enabling the drive to be reset and redeployed as many times as needed. In addition to encrypting all of the PINs, data and the encryption key itself, the Aegis Padlock adds another barrier between a between your data and a hacker. The encryption chip and circuitry of the Aegis Padlock are completely protected by a super tough epoxy compound, which is virtually impossible to remove without damaging the drive.",

                "reviewText": "I have five of these, and all are working fine. There is no noticeable performance loss due to encryption. From a NAS to the USB 3.0 Padlock I've seen burst speeds of 100MBytes/sec. (800Mbits/sec.), then it settles down to a steady 62 Mega Bytes per second. I've transferred a 2.6 GigaByte movie file in about 40 seconds.The Positive:1. Because there's no software to install, it works with media players and should work anywhere you use a standard USB hard drive. I keep kid's movies on a standard drive, and my movies on the Padlock. No need to worry about the kids watching R-rated movies when I'm not around!2. Multiple passwords allow up to ten persons to enter their own password using the alpha-numeric keys. This is very convenient if you want to use your Windows password to access the drive. All other encryption devices I have tried allow only one user password or have only numeric keys. A separate Administrator password allows you to delete or add other user's passwords.3. Low power consumption - I have been able to use the drive on every computer or media player I have without the provided Y-power cable.What it won't do - the down side:1. Although you can have multiple passwords, all users access the same data on the drive. It would be a real plus if file access could be controlled by which password is entered.2. Rebooting your computer locks the drive even though power is never removed from the drive. I have a remote office and I do a lot of work using remote desktops. Occasionally I need to reboot the remote computer, and with this drive the data is inaccessible after the reboot. For me, this is a \"deal breaker\" and I need to stay with software encryption on a standard hard drive. It would be nice to have an optional software program to lock and unlock the drive.",

                "reviewText": "I had used several Apricorn Aegis a drives at work and decided to try one for personal use. Case is tough and doesn't feel like it will be damaged easily. Transfer speeds are good given it is a HDD inside. The cable could be longer but it is nice to be able to snap it into place around the device and not carry a separate cable if you don't want to. The one thing I usually have to do on most modern computers I have used it on is to adjust the power saving settings on the USB port it is plugged into. More often than not the power port would enter low power mode during a multi-hour transfer which would trip the auto-lock on the drive. While a nice security feature, and how it should be as it thinks you removed the drive, it could be frustrating to come back several hours later thinking the transfer should be done but it only got 5-10% through before it quit. After adjusting the power saving settings though the issue has not returned. These drives are great and I have recommended them to anyone else who needs a nice hardware encrypted drive that does not rely on software executables on the computer to unlock your drive.",
