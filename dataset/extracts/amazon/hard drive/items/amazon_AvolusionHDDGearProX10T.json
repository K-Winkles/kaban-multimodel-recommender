I easily transferred my old hard drive to this one and the USB 3. It comes with a power switch id you want to power it off. I leave it plugged in. The games I play on it don't have any issues. They load and play great.I definitely recommend this product.",

Moved it off and on a mouse pad, this relieved some of the noise and vibration issue. So not sure how long this thing is going to last, see if their warranty is going to be worth it down the road. Will say it is cheap 10tb external HD for just storing all those XBox games I have gotten over the last 10 years.",
