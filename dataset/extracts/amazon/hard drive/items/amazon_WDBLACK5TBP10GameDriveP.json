                "reviewText": "First, I build and repair a lot of computers and electronics for family and friends. I ALWAYS use Western Digital drives when building or replacing a hard drive. I usually use the \"Black\" series of drives for performance, durability, and the warranty. These drives last well past their warranties with decent performance for a conventional platter drive. These are the ones to use when you need a large capacity conventional hard drive.I purchased this 5TB gaming external drive to expand the capacity of my PS4. For the first time, I've gone all digital with my PS4 games to reduce the number of game cases and disks around. I also like to have all of the games available without re-downloading, so this makes digital storage capacity at the console critical for me.Hooking up this drive, formatting it, and moving games over from the internal PS4 HD was much easier than I had anticipated. Downloading games from PSN to the external hard drive is also seamless. Running games directly from the portable drive through the USB 3.0 connection doesn't seem to be any slower than launching them from the internal hard drive, at least I haven't noticed any difference in the load times by subjective evaluation. When running continuously, like during a game transfers, the drive gets warm but doesn't seem to get hot enough where I would be concerned.The only major down side to this drive, and it's a flaw with most of the 2.5\" based WD portable drives, is that they put the drive's activity light right next to the USB cable connection. I have the drive stacked on top of my PS4 so that i can see the light flash whenever it's reading / writing. I would rather not see the cable, which has to be twisted from the front back around the housing to plug it into the rear PS4 USB port. Depending on how you route the cable, you may not be able to see the light from certain angles if the cable blocks your line of sight. It's not a big deal, but it would be nicer if they had the drive activity light on the other side for a cleaner looking setup.The other down side, which doesn't bother me at all since I'm not planning to tear this thing apart and I haven't verified this info personally, is that according to youtube reviews the drive itself is not a standard 2.5\" SATA laptop drive. The actual hard drive is a portable specific build with a different interface board, so you can't disassemble this bad boy and pop the drive into something else or use the enclosure with a different 2.5\" HD.I've only had mine for a couple of months, but so far I have no complaints. It does everything I need with no perceivable penalty in performance. The extra storage space (5TB!) is a life saver since I had maxed out my PS4's internal drive, and it had already been upgraded to a 2TB drive. This is a much better option than cutting up the PS4's case to fit the height of a 4TB internal replacement. In addition, Sony did a nice job in making this approach a well supported option for expanding the PS4's storage capacity.",

                "reviewText": "The sleek black enclosure with the white letters makes this enclosure look rugged and near military style. The drive isn't rugged and shock proof, just appears that way. Small in size and light weight, this drive is portable. Their is not much bulk to the enclosure and the enclosure is not much larger than a 2.5inch HD. The drive is very quiet and is passively cooled, no loud fans spinning. There is a white LED on one end of the drive that indicates power and data transfer to the drive. The LED does fade in and out depending on what the drive is doing but will remain lit while powered. It is not adjustable in any way and does not have a way to disable. Just a personal preference, but I do like the LED and the overall look of the drive.They do include a USB cable that is less than 1 foot in length. I'm guessing to keep the data transfer speeds from being affected by longer cables. I have not replaced with a longer cable but it is an option. Not sure if it will affect performance.NO EXTRA POWER NEEDED! USB power is all that is needed. Only one cable needed with this drive. This means less wires to manage and less risk for dust or debris to get into the drive or ports.Set up was easy for the PS4, all I had to do was format through the settings after I connected the drive to the console.I use this external drive on my PS4 connected to the USB. My console still has the original HD internally, but I use this as my Extended Drive and where all of my games are installed. While I haven't done any testing or timing, the load times appear to be nearly the same as the OEM hard drive that was included with the system.The 5TB storage capacity has allowed me to install every PS4 game I own on disc and has allowed me for the first time to purchase digital copies of games. No more need to delete installed games and wait countless hours for them to re-install!!If you are wanting a mechanical HD for your gaming needs, I highly recommend this drive! I've purchased 2 for my home and really love them!",
