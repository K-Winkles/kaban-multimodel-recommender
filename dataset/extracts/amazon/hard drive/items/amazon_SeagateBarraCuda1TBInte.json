                "reviewText": "06/27/2018 ... I installed this in my neighbor's laptop computer HP Pavilion 17-E098NR Notebook PC on 05/03/2018 and two months later there have been no problems except one of the updates to windows 10 prevented the laptop from booting but fortunately I made backups at each step with Acronis True Image 2018 using the bootable DVD. I delivered the laptop to my neighbors and it has been working fine.Traditional \"Spinner\" hard drive or SSD? I did a lot of research and decided the risk of a sudden failure or silently corrupted files was not worth the price no matter how fast SSD's run.PROS:Speed - Comparing the performance of the old hard drive I would say this is 30% or mor faster and lots more space - 250GB vs 1TB. System boots much quicker and programs start faster. The large cache memory seems to make the drive faster than it really is... more about this in \"CONS\" below.CONS:Speed - Fast as mentioned above BUT... there is some magicians slight of hand going on involving the cache memory. Ordinary read / write activites happen fast but large file copes start fast and slow way down. I partitioned the drive so that there was a D: drive - to store a backup inamge of the C: drive (I also put a copy on my home computer in case the entire drive failed). I was shocked at how slow a file transfer was from C: to D: (two different partitions on the same drive) it should normally be 1/2 the speed as it is a read and write operation. I also did a speed test of copying the same large files over my home network through and Ethernet cable and a usb drive. In all cases the drive has a speed burst then the cache memory runs out and the copy fell to speeds like 7 to 10 MB/s! - can't remember exact speeds. Most people don't do these types of file operations so it should not matter.I also bought the same 1TB drive (Except the 5.25\" desktop version) at the same time from amazon for my Desktop PC and it did not have such dramatic slowdowns.",

Had my old HDD die on me from Seagate after using it as backup storage for 7 years. This is an affordable option if ur motherboard is compatible, and you know what you're doing. I had to reset my motherboard, update BIOS and switch SATA connection to the top of my SATA 0. Works like a charm now and likely will last for another 7 years, don't use this as an important file storing device or keep your windows on it since if it goes dead you will likely struggle to bring your PC to life like me. Luckily I had all my important files on my SSD.",
