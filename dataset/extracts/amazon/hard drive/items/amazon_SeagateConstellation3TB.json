They were listed as new and as such (and per Amazon's guidelines) should be exactly that, New with manufacturer warranty if there is one. These normally have a 3 or 5 year warranty and when one failed and I contacted Seagate to have the drive replaced via the warranty, I was surprised to find that it had already expired - it shouldn't have. Checked the warranty on the remaining drives from this order, and it was apparent that these were not new drives.I contacted Amazon, and they contacted the seller on our behalf. It's been over a week and have heard nothing from the seller. We are a business and purchase hardware for our clients on Amazon Business expecting we are getting what we pay for and that we will receive good customer service. Thankfully Amazon took care of us so we can now replace all of these drives for our client.",
