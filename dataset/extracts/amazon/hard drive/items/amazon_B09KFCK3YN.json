From this point on, here's the new agenda\u2026. if it works as advertised, is well made, meets or exceeds the description, is a value, and arrives in a fair amount of time, it will get a \"star rating\" equal to what my expectations were/are. If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page. Sellers have done this a couple of times in the past, and I was true to my word then as well as now. DR",

I clicked submit and got it in a few days. I then went through the painful and laborious process of moving the entire contents of my system disk to the SS drive. After an hour or so I booted from the new disk. I could tell right away it was snappier. Cut the boot time in half. Now I\u2019ll wind up filling this one up.Good drive. No issues. Solid performance.

The only documentation that came with a small brochure with an 800 number that no one ever answered.In order to find the Acronis software that was supposed to come with it, I had to circle back to the product page on Amazon and read about it there. I was replacing an old HDD and ran the Acronis software to create a new bootable SSD. I ran it in the recommended automatic install and I ended up with 250 useable gigs and around 750 unallocated, meaning I couldn't do anything with it.On the Acronis website I was sent through a labyrinth of links that took me to create an account with a reg key, which isn't provided since this is an OEM with HP. No help there.I finally figured it out and got my 1T SSD working and it's absolutely amazing and super fast.5-stars for the SSD0-stars for the support because there is no support",
