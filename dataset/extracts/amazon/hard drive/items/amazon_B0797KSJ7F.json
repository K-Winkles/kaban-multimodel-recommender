                "reviewText": "My son wanted to purchase a new PS4 game but he was out of space on his PS4. I researched where we could buy 1000 GB. Best Buy advertised online that it had a hard drive with 1000 GB for sale for $45.00. When we got to the store that product was not available. They did have one available for $70 but we did not want to pay that much money. My son was disappointed but I knew what I had to do. I went to my two go to sites, E-Bay and Amazon. My son realized he only needed 500 GB. I purchased the evolution 500 GB USB 3.0 portable external PS4 hard drive on Amazon. He is thirteen years old and he installed it himself in less than one minute. It connects via plug to the PS4 console. He\u2019s been using it for two weeks and is very happy! I would purchase from this seller again.",
