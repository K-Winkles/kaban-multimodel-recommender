The instructions are not very well written, lots of typos and they also say to make sure the Xbox is off before plugging the device in but I found that the Xbox MUST be on when you connect this device, otherwise your Xbox will not recognize it. You do however have to ensure your Xbox is off when you disconnect it or you may lose data/games. I was concerned if it would work because of the price because it's lower than any other I found, but it works flawlessly so far!",
