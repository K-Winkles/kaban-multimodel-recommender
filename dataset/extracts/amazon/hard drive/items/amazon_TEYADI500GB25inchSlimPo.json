                "reviewText": "This drive is super convenient to store movies, music or anything that you want. I use it to store movies on and then I just connect it to my tv with the USB cable that is provided and watch them. It makes watching movies really easy if you go to a friend\u2019s place. Yes they are small enough to fit in your pocket and very sturdy. Plus they do not need an external power source just plug them in and use.If your car or TV has a standard USB you can either watch movies or music. Very cool for roadtrips for listening to podcasts or books or your favorite music. The TEYADI hard drives come ready to use and can be used on your Windows PC, Mac or for that matter games like PS4 or Xbox. They come in sizes from 320 GB and 500 GB to 1 TB.I have the 320 and the 500 and they both perform flawlessly. They come with the needed USB3.0 cable and a 3 year warranty plus free lifetime tech support. I use them on both USB 3.0 or the older USB 2.0 because my desktop only has one port that\u2019s 3.0. Another great item from Amazon that truly is a 5 star hit.",
