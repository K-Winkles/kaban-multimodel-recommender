                "reviewText": "I have purchased two of the external hard drives. The first was stolen by a student in the college class I teach. My fault, of course, for being careless. The replacement died after I downloaded course material onto it. When I plug it into my desktop computer, its blue light blinks for a few seconds then dies. I even bought a new cord for it. No luck!",
