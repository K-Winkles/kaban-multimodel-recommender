                "reviewText": "The drive is formatted to 12.79TB using ext4 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Seems to run cool and extremely quiet. The only way I can tell it is working is by putting my fingers on top of it and feeling for vibrations.UPDATE 1a: OCT 26, 2020The drive did get hot after months of use inside the original enclosure. It reached a temperature of 56C/132F. So that should be a concern. It runs 29C/84F inside the Synology 220J with active fan cooling. The room it was in was air-conditioned and no more than 75F ambient room temperature.Both drives are WDC WD140EDFZ-11A0VA0 14000.5GBFirmware 81.00A81 5400 RPM 512 MB Cache(HC530 are rated at 7200 RPM so these drives are throttled down to a lower RPM or at least one is - idk)HGST HC530 family drives with TDMRUPDATE 1b: OCT 26, 2020I purchased a second 14TB, approximately four months later than my first one. I wanted a low-power solution to keeping movie files available for Plex and Amazon had a Prime Day sale on an entry-level Synology DS220J NAS. The two Nvidia Shield Pro 2019 will handle any heavy transcoding (if any) because the NAS is not designed with Plex transcoding in mind.My second drive came in a different color box too so I initially panicked. But after running CrystalDisk Info and Speedtest, I was relieved that both boxes had the same exact drive inside the hard plastic enclosure. So I hope this serves as a heads up for anyone shucking these drives too. Rest assured they are the same drives with the same exact firmware. The first was purchased in June of 2020, and the second in August 2020. Four months apart. Keep that in mind as we head into 2021 and later.I did get different benchmark tests but I am hoping that it was due to having four months of data (7 TB) on the original drive and perhaps CrystalDisk performed its benchmarks from vastly different cylinders on each drive. As you can see from the included screengrab, the model numbers are identical. The DS220J also reported the same under DSM 6.2. I will have them set up as SHR mirroring in the NAS. I wish I could have done the benchmark test with two clean drives but I would need a third 14TB drive which would make it a bit beyond my means at this moment.UPDATE 1c: OCT 27, 2020(added one additional picture of Storage Manager, Synology's NAS app)I have both drives inside my Synology DS220j running Synology's parity consistency check for at least 30 hours non-stop. Both drives run significantly cooler on the Synology NAS than the WD plastic enclosures. In the WD plastic enclosure, they ran at 54-56c while on the NAS, they run 30c-33c. Average about 20 degrees hotter centigrade in the WD factory enclosure. I wonder if earlier failures I had with other WD USB drives in the past could be attributed to them running hotter than normal. Even if you don't need the advanced features of a NAS, I would recommend a lower-end less expensive model like the DS200j just to keep the drives running cooler and of course for its data redundancy protection. I will continue to update for at least one year. If the nas works out for me really well for the next twelve months, I'll upgrade to a four-bay unit to use some of the more advanced raid implementations.UPDATE: JUNE 16, 2022Since my last update, I purchased two more additional drives and I have upgraded NAS from the DS220j to the Synology DS920+ (four-bay intel CPU model). The drives are configured in a Synology Raid setup which holds a shared data storage for five PCs and 4K 2160p Plex library. Two 2019 Nvidia Shield Pro streamers and two smart TVs stream movies and DVR newscasts from it. The DS920+ has reported 4722 Hrs (Powered on) and the drives remain year-around at 30C/86F. S.M.A.R.T reports zero errors across all four drives. The DS920+ is plugged into a UPS and it receives power reports from the UPS through its data connection.So far I have no problems with these WD14TB drives. I honestly feel it's just the lousy plastic enclosures that they come in that cause many problems due to overheating and possibly user error with usb/power cables. But once they are in an active cooled protected environment like a NAS, they are very reliable.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars It's not just that it failed after three months...",
                "reviewText": "The big problem is not JUST that the unit failed completely after three months (it just cold boots, no lights, no connection to any computer), it's that your data is encrypted so that you can't just pull the drive and get your stuff. This is a requirement of their RAID software, you can't turn it off.So ... you'll probably do what I did, request a replacement. If you have ANY DATA on those drives that you'd like to recover, you'll need to do an \"Advanced\" RMA (replacement request), because they require you to send the old drive back FIRST with a \"normal\" replacement. Understandable, I guess. But an Advanced RMA costs $25, and they place a hold on your credit card for the cost of the drive until you return the old one. Oh, and you pay for shipping! So at the very least, you're out about $35 (and if you're like me, quite a bit of productivity) just to get a replacement which you'll hopefully be able to swap the hopefully still functional drives into. (And if you're like me, your credit card will trigger a fraud warning when they go to place the hold, placing the RMA into a kind of limbo ... but luckily everything is \"fine\", the guy at WD just told me to \"try again tomorrow\". My expectations are sky high obvi.)To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. This product is a disaster. And the idea that many people like me are using it as a Raid 1 because they want their data to be mirrored all the time (likely due to our previous painful experiences with failed harddrives) ... I mean ... More fool us. Why, why do I keep buying WD drives?! Buyer be very wary of this product. If / when it fails you're in for a real headache.March 2022 Edit: After going through the arduous return process, WD sent me a replacement unit and I was able to swap the drives into it. All of the files were fine and intact, so I sent the \"old\" unit back. TWO MONTHS LATER, THE REPLACEMENT UNIT IS 100% BRICKED AS WELL. It has BARELY been used (seeing as I don't trust it at all). I'm so livid with WD. I will not go through the return process again but will count this as a very expensive loss and lesson never to touch Wester Digital products.",
