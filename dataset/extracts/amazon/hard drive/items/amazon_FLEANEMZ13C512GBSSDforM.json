                "reviewText": "I took a chance on this SSD even though it didn't have a lot of reviews, and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome. I had a 2013 era MacBook Air, Model A1466, that was giving me the question mark folder of death due to a bad 128 gb SSD drive.I ordered this SSD and had it the next day.A couple of major plusses:1.) It came with the correct size screwdrivers necessary to remove both the laptop case screws (5-point torx) and the screw that holds the SSD. (Standard 6-point torx)2.) It came with a thumb drive containing Mac OS Big Sur.Initially I wasn't going to use the thumb drive, but the original OS didn't detect the new 256 GB SSD, so I booted from the thumb drive, used the disk utility to format the new SSD, then installed Big Sur from the drive. At that point it was painless.Fortunately I didn't have data I needed to save on this MacBook, so I brought it up as a fresh installation without trying to port data. It's like a I have a brand new MacBook and it has given it a new lease on life.Side note: Due to my own lack of awareness and attention to detail, I missed the business card that was in the box that had a QR code that would have taken me right to a web page with detailed instructions for installation along with answers to commonly asked questions.I'd definitely buy this again.",

About four days before travel for three weeks my wife\u2019s MacBook Pro displayed the infamous black screen with the folder in the middle, in other words it wasn\u2019t reading the hard drive. I took a gamble and order this product. It arrived the next day. I immediately installed it and it fit perfectly like OEM. I had to format it and get an updated operating system installed per the instructions, and after had no issues. My wife used her MacBook Pro during the three week travel with zero computer issues. In fact, her mac actually seems to function better than it did with the original drive. Like something about it seems a little faster with the new drive.Also, love the fact they shipped tools and an operating system with it.",
