                "reviewText": "Great little drive for my use case- I have multiple systems and I use this to load game files to each system rather than using up internet bandwidth on each rig (unless you have unlimited, it typically caps to 1.2 TB monthly on residential plans). Games are getting bigger and bigger so this is a simple solution- transfer speeds are as advertised assuming you have the right USB 3 2x2 interface (20gbps).Love the form factor as well- great buy for the price.",

                "reviewText": "With 512 GB of storage you have plenty for most peoples backup needs. (There's a 1 TB version available too). While not as small as a regular USB flash drive the case seems more durable plus the larger size will make it less likely that you will lose it. It comes with two data cables, USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to USB-A, so you can connect it to just about any device.The advertised read times are up to 2000 MB/s and write times up to 1700 MB/s. I don't know what test program they used or what test parameters were used but my tests didn't get anywhere near those numbers. I used the MiniTool Partition Wizard v 12.7 on my Windows 10 PC and connected to the USB 3.1 port. Using a 1 GB file length with a transfer size of 4 KB yielded sequential reading at 146 MB/s, sequential writing at 171 MB/s, random reading at 113 MB/s and random writing at 161 MB/s. Using a transfer size of 32 KB yielded sequential reading at 355 MB/s, sequential writing at 382 MB/s, random reading at 350 MB/s and random writing at 370 MB/s. While these don't even approach the rated maximums they are fine for my backup purposes.Overall, I liked the drive but I docked it one star for advertising speeds that I don't believe you can even get close to.",
