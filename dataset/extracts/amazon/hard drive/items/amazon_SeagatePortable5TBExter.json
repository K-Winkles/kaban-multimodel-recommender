                "reviewText": "I received my 5 TB Portable HDD in the mail today, and I just finished transferring 1.5 TB worth of games and other files to it. It seems to be a good HDD so far. I had previously bought an open box 2.5\" 5 TB HDD on eBay for $102 and I had all kinds of problems with it. First, it would not format as NTFS. Whereas this Portable HDD was already formatted as NTFS and I had no problem re quick formatting it as NTFS. The other one had a HDD failure after copying 70% of my 1.5 TB of game files. And it took like 12 hours just to copy 70% of 1.5 TB. Whereas this new Portable HDD copied all 1.5 TB of files in like 5-6 hours. And finally, this Portable HDD has its own case and USB Cord, so I don't have to spend another $30-50 for that stuff.Do I think that this Portable HDD is perfect? Not 100%, but close enough. For one, I wish that the USB Cord was 2 feet long instead of only 18\" (1.5 feet) long. In the Questions & Answers section, there were different answers on how long the USB Cord was. One person said half a foot. Another said two feet. I stupidly believed the guy who said two feet long, but he was wrong. It's 1.5 feet long, not 2 feet. Also the part of the USB Cord that plugs into the computer's USB port is a tiny bit loose. I wish that it was more snug.I did have four tiny hiccups while copying my files from the old HDD to the new HDD. The first hiccup was it saying that there was 0% Progress on coping a 67.5 MB folder, but the entire contents had already been fully copied and the copied folder even said 67.5 MB in Properties. I even re-copied and replaced the folder, but it still said 0% Progress in the transfer window. I had to disconnect the Portable HDD and plug it in again to get rid of that 0% Progress message. The second hiccup was my computer not detecting the HDD after my first laptop restart. I had to unplug the HDD and plug it back again. Although later, I restarted computer a second time and the HDD showed up right away. The third hiccup was it refusing to copy a different folder the first time. I cancelled it by clicking the x button on the top right and then tried it again, and it started copying the second time. And the fourth hiccup was checking the sizes of all my folders and learning that one of the folders hadn't copied completely. I recopied and replaced, no problem. It was a small sized folder. I'm pretty confident that everything should work good from now on. At least I would hope so. I don't have a backup of this stuff, and I don't want to have to start over or bother with copying HDD contents again.I definitely recommend this HDD for the price and seemingly good quality, especially considering you don't need to buy a hard drive enclosure or other parts. Although the USB Cord isn't exceptional, it's good enough so I probably won't be spending any more money getting a different one. The 3.5\" HDD isn't that much bigger than a 2.5\" and you can put the HDD someplace where it doesn't take up any desk space. So yeah, I definitely think that this will be your best solution for 5 TB of hard drive space.Update: It's been seven months since I purchased this item, and it's working great!",
