They do eventually fail, but none failed in the first 5 years and I have one that's been running 9 years... They are no longer made (replaced by WD Gold, itself replaced by WD Ultrastar DC), but I still have several running just fine.For anyone accustomed to SSD speed, these are really slow, of course, but in a RAID configuration they are plenty fast enough for streaming 4K with DTS sound (even in a RAID configuration intended for error-tolerance more than speed, such as RAID 5).",
