I have 11 in a RAID 6 array and have written approx. 50TB of data thus far and all of the drives are performing as expected. SMART info on the drives indicate that they are new drives. In the box there is a warranty card indicating the drives have a 5 year warranty. I hope I never have to submit a request, but if I do I will update my review with the status. For the price, you can't beat this deal. Very pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I have this drive paired up with a twin, and I'm running them at RAID 0 in my HDD RAID enclosure. That gives me a whopping 24TB of fast HDD storage.Although I do save system backups on it, it has room and the speed for my entire game library to be loaded and ready to play. That's how I like it, because I spontaneously jump from game to game a lot, so I do not have to constantly reload the games I suddenly want to play.",
