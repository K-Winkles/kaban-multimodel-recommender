                "reviewText": "Good little drive. Performs as advertised (using the correct USB port version or faster). Runs warm, though that was after a stress so no real concerns. The enclosure is very cheap feeling, though I can get past that and may actually help with heat.It did have an autorun BAT file and an icon file. I'm assuming the BAT file was to tell your system to pull the icon, though I have that stuff disabled and didn't care to check before doing a full initial wipe.Posting with a picture of CrystalDiskMark with the same settings as some others. I had it plugged into a USB 3.2 (Gen2) port. I noticed those that ran slower were on pots (like 3.0) that realistically are much slower than the advertised theoretical speeds for the standard.",

                "reviewText": "Once I FINISHED getting my 800gb of crucial files (from two PCs) onto this ingenious device, this Buffalo SSD (an SSD hiding in a USB stick format) will BE TERRIFIC: IT reads and sends files BACK to any PC very fast. However, I had to backup manually, chunks at a time, because this drive has ZERO head dissipation ability. I.e., after just a few multi-gigabyte multi-file backups TO it, its speed (on my modern PC0 kept thottling back from 400-450 mbps, down to the 20s (!!!). The good news? This gadget DOES protect itself from burning up BY so drastically throttling back. The bad news? Whenever this \"throttling\" does happen, the drive's measured temperature has quickly soared from 30 degrees C to over 65. Weirdly, the case gets barely warm, which tells me all that heat just SITS INSIDE, until it is removed and allowed to cool for an hour. HOWEVER, after one finally GETS such big chunks of files ON this drive, it will be GREAT for portability, fast RETRIEVAL of files and reliability.",

The drive feels cheaply built, but it seems like it'd last a long time if taken care of. I'm kind of concerned the performance won't last long.
