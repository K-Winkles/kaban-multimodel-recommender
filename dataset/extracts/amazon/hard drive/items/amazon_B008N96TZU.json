                "reviewText": "This Kingwin Tech internal 3 x 2.5\" HDD to 5.25\" metal adapter is a very nifty bracket. It worked perfectly for me. There are some things you should know; read on!I needed to install a couple of SSDs (every one of my 6 SATA connectors is used) and this was a beauty.1. The SSD that went on the bottom ONLY uses bottom screws for attaching.2. I skipped the middle, which provided some room to plug/remove the cables, and installed the other SSD on the top.3. Both middle and top slots use side screws for attachment, unless the bracket is flipped, which would make the top the bottom and vice-versa.4. One more thing that is WORTH mentioning is that this is NOT as tall as a regular 5.25\" unit (CD/DVD). It is shorter. For my situation it was a blessing, since one of the SATA power cables makes a loop (plug is in the middle of cable) and needs space above and below.5. It has two (2) sets of bolting patterns (onto the computer case). Use the top ones and it will be flush with the bottom of the 5.25\" space available. Use the bottom ones, and it will be flush with the top. COOL!6. These metal brackets are made of fairly thick gauge galvanized sheet-metal (probably 18ga), which provides plenty of metal for the screws to grab onto without ever stripping the female threads. This is GREAT!7. A little Warning: DO NOT slide your fingers alongside the edge of the metal, since these were not filed/sanded into a ultra-safe/smooth roundness; it MAY cut through the skin. The shearing press used was very good, and NORMAL handling is totally safe. Rounding the edges would have increased the cost of these units substantially.8. Great Value.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works well enough, could have used more mounting holes",
                "reviewText": "So at the advice of a friend, we decided to use the Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive for the hard drive in a desktop build. He was right -- it's fast and works great, plus, he said that because it's smaller hard drive, the size that a laptop would use, it's more likely (on average) to be fault tolerant and handle shocks better than a standard 3.5 inch hard drive. But this isn't a review about the Seagate Momentus, it's about the mounting kit.We purchased this kit so that the 2.5 inch Seagate hard drive would fit in a 3.5 inch slot on a standard ATX case (the Raidmax Blade ATX Mid Tower Case , to be exact, great case by the way). The Kingwin Mounting Kit did the job well enough, but try as we might, we couldn't get any four holes on the hard drive to line up with both four holes on the mounting kit and on the case. So we have the hard drive in the kit with just two holes (the front two, to be precise) screwed in.The hard drive still fits securely (naturally the back end of it will pivot up if you pull on it), and it's not like we plan to move around a desktop alot (especially not while it's on). I think that if it had just had more holes in it in order to give us more options as to where to put the screws, we could have more tightly secured the drive.As it is, it does the job at a great price, and I would've given it 4.5 stars if I could, but I'm going to round down on this one, if only to encourage the company to improve, or perhaps offer different options.But it might work better with your particular case, so far it's the most competitively priced mounting kit on Amazon that I see (and it has Prime shipping), so I think if I had a need for one in the future, I'd still get another one of these (as long as it's with a different case).",

                "reviewText": "I bought to this to mount the SSD boot drive for my OpenMediaVault home NAS. Since I was using a mid tower for necessary drive bays (I've got 10 SATA Ports, I want to be able to use them!), I needed a good spot for my boot drive and wasn't using the back panel card slots other than the \"top\" one with an ITX board. This was a great solution even when my case has a 2.5 mount option at the bottom since that partially interferes with a 3.5 bay. Admittedly, I'm using this system on it's side in a \"desktop\" configuration, so sagging isn't an issue with this adapter being mounted with a board to connect to but it works great for me. The metal construction was good and should hold up to anything I ask of it down the road. Should I run into a use for this type of adapter again, this is be my go to.",

So when I came across this adapter I was quite intrigued and ordered one to test it out. It appears to very sturdy and comes with nine screws in a little plastic baggie; 8 to mount two drives (4 screws per HDD) and 1 to secure the adapter to the expansion slot.Pro's:Made from sturdy steel.Smooth black powder coating that will resist rust and fingerprint stains.Anti-Vibration foam rubber along the rails where the side of the drive contacts the frame (the description photos don't show it, but it's there).Con's:If I were to nitpick; I would say that the drive mounting screws feel a little gritty. I'm guessing it's some of the coating on the screws threads coming off, as removing the screws - then screwing them back in - felt smooth.Other thoughts:Due to the foam lining, you will need to use push the drives in - as there's some friction. The fit is so tight you could probably skip the mounting screws, but that's just my opinion.Turns out my computer doesn't recognize my 1TB Hard Drive and will shut down as soon as Window's boots. Guess I have an excuse now to upgrade the motherboard :D",
