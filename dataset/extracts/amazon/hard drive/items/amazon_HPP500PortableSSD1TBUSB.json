                "reviewText": "This NEW HP Portable SSD P500 (1TB) Hard Drive is pure TRASH. Considering that this is where one stores all one's important files and irreplaceable photos, IT NEEDS TO BE DEPENDABLE. It isn't. When I got it, it worked just fine. It is plug n play, so simply connected it to the HP laptop and started to transfer ALL our photos and important documents, for safekeeping. On the second day of transferring our files to it, ALL OF A SUDDEN it just stopped working and it disappeared from view on our laptop, so we could no longer access ANY of our files and photos... NOTHING. For all effect it was as if it was not even there. Other devices connected to the same USB-C connection just fine. Tried it on another laptop and same result... NOTHING there. Tried the USB-C to USB-C cord on another device and it worked just fine. Just this HP Portable SSD P500 hard drive is the problem, ceasing to work/be read by the second day of use.Called Amazon Tech Support (Shawneil). He said that there was NO WARRANTY because it was bought thru a non HP seller, even though the sale was from \"The HP Store\"... go figure that one out. He tried to solution it directly but couldn't. So he called HP Tech Support, which gave us the run around for 56 mins. He acknowledged our frustration with HP Tech Support and managed to just give me a refund of $59.99 of the $64.99 that I paid for it, plus tax. Well, something is better than nothing, since I CANNOT RETURN the product because it has all my files and photos LOCKED and UNACCESSIBLE within it.Just the same, I will never buy another HP product again, it they are now building such CR*P.However, I have to acknowledge the Amazon Tech Support representative, Shawneil, for excellent Customer Service. His efforts and understanding of my frustrations with this product, went a long way to make my grievance less stressful. Thank you Shawneil.",

I highly recommend this drive and especially for the price.",
