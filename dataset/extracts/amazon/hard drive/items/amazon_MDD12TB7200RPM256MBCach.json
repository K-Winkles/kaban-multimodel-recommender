                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these. Using them under WINDOWS 10 in a Sabrent 2 bay USB 3.0 drive dock. I am almost finished copying over 22TB of video files from a bunch of smaller drives I amassed over the years.So far no issues at all. They arrived very nicely packaged including a 3 year warranty card AND even an instruction manual for neophytes who might not know to format them FIRST. I must say for $7.50 per TB I am most impressed. If you bring the 20TB down to this price point per TB I'll buy one of those too:).One tip to all: make SURE you use a 3.0 USB port AND CABLE on your PC if you go to the USB route. 2.0 ports look the same and if you use one of those even though the dock is a 3.0 your transfer speed will be a LOT slower. A USB connection will be limited by the slowest of port, cable, or device. Also, you need a POWERED dock to run these via USB as the bus itself does not provide enough juice. And lastly, be advised that formatting under WINDOWS uses about ten percent of drive space, so after you format these you will have 10.91TB of space left for files.",
