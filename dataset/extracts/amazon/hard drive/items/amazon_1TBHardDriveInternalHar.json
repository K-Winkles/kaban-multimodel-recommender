Ultrastar 7K4000 represents the sixth-generation HGST 5-platter design, which has been field proven by top server and storage OEMs and Internet giants. Engineered for the highest quality, the Ultrastar 7K4000 is put through grueling design tests during development and must pass stringent ongoing reliability testing during manufacturing. Ultrastar 7K4000 delivers by reducing downtime, eliminating service calls and minimizing TCO. Combining 7200 RPM performance and granular power control Operating at 7200 RPM, the Hitachi Ultrastar 7K4000 offers better overall performance than slower-RPM, capacity-oriented drives at impressively low power-consumption rates. When compared to the previous generation Ultrastar 7K3000, the 7K4000 offers up to a 155% improvement in sustained data transfer rate, and a 120% improvement in watts-per-GB. With five Advanced Power Management modes, a 36% reduction in watts during low-RPM idle mode, and using less than 1W during standby/sleep mode, the Ultrastar 7K4000 can help data centers achieve lower AC power and HVAC requirements, freeing up precious headroom Enhancing data safety and security To ensure the utmost in data safety and security, the Ultrastar 7K4000 is also available with a bulk data encryption (BDE) option. When enabled, the Hitachi BDE implementation encrypts all data on the drive using a private security key as it is written to the disk, and then decrypts it with the key as it is retrieved, giving users an e",
