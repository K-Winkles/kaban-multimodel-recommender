                "reviewText": "The seller was Amazon. I paid 30 bucks.I am using this to toggle between 2 drives (a solid state drive SSD, and a regular hard drive HDD). I have Windows XP on one, and Windows 10 on the other. It is much easier for me to control what Operating System boots-up by using this power switch module, than it is to change my BIOS settings each time I boot (or attempting to create partitions, which I tried to do but was unsuccessful).The installation was easy, and the instructions are fine. After popping off both sides of my desktop case and the front panel, I removed one of the 5.25\" drive bay protectors from my PC case. The module comes with 6-8 screws. I inserted two and screwed them down on both sides. Great fit.There are 2 sets of power cables: two 4-pin molex male connectors (one on each side), and two 15-pin SATA input power Y-cables (one on each side). You only need to use one set of these for power (either both molex, or both SATA). I used the 2 molex connectors. I initially connected only 1 molex connector, and later decided to connect them both, because that's what the instructions said. I suspect, but am not sure, that one power connector may power switches 1-3, and the other may power switches 4-6, but I didn't test that. I can say that when I only had one power connector attached that all LED lights on the front glowed when the buttons were pressed.At first boot with only one power cable attached, I got a error about master boot record. I rebooted and it went away. Then I decided to attach the second molex power connector. No error messages after multiple boots.I have my BIOS set to boot to the Windows 10 drive first, and the Windows XP drive second (if the first drive fails). That means if I swap power from one drive to another, my PC will always boot to one OS or the other...without me having to make more BIOS changes.If you look at the photo on Amazon (the one that shows the cables), you'll see 6 white connectors that look like fan cables. That's deceptive. Those connectors plug into the module itself. The other end of those connectors plug into your SSD/HDD power receptacle. Most of the connectors that go to your SSD/HDD are labeled with numbers...the shortest cables do not have a number on them, but it's easy to tell what they are.My PC case is a Zalman Z9 Plus System Cabinet - Mid-tower. Lots of room. I had no problem installing the module, and the cables were long enough for me. No complaints.The LED lights on the front under the buttons glow blue.The module does exactly what I need it to do. It beats the alternative, which was to leave the side of my PC case open and swap power cables as needed (or reset boot order in my BIOS whenever I wanted to use the other OS). I'm happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The KIngwin HDD Power Switch Module is a well designed, solidly built product. This device, mounted in an extra DVD drive bay, allows you to have multiple separate computers operating in one single case. This offers the benefits of saving power on unused drives, prevents applications on one HDD from interfering with other applications on other drives, and prevents accidental erasure of a drive while adding a new operating system. The cables are pre-attached and long enough to reach the farthest places in a large case.In my instance, I operate a ProTools recording system that uses its own mixing board, sound card, etc.on a high powered computer. Due to the complexity of the software and all its plug-ins it is recommended to operate ProTools on a single computer all by itself. By using the Kingwin HDD Power Switch Module I can run a Windows XP computer for all my legacy software on one solid state drive, my Windows7 recording computer on another SSD, and another Win7 SSD drive for all of my other stuff - one at a time without interfering with each other. All 3 SSD's share a single large HDD data drive which is left on all the time. It's very convenient (and space saving).I have the pushbuttons on the front clearly labeled so that I know which drive is which. I turn on the one drive that I want to use and turn off the others, then boot up the computer. When I'm finished, I allow the drive to shut down completely during reboot, then turn it off and switch the other one on while the computer is re-booting. Works perfectly.Be CAREFUL and DO NOT push these buttons while the computer is running. I fried my motherboard by carelessly pushing on off buttons for the hard drives. To be sure this never happens to you, ALWAYS POWER DOWN first before switching hard drive configurations.I have been trying to solve this problem for years and the Kingwin HDD Power Switch Module does it for me. It will simplify things greatly. If you operate a complex computer, try one and be careful with it.",

This product is going to last me for 25 years. My only tiny quibble is the indicator lights are extremely bright - they probably could have gotten away with a quarter as bright - but, on the other hand, it impresses the kids.",
