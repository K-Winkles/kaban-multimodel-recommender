Although, 1Tb are so common these days, the price marginally agreed with me - could have been lower, but I decided to buy 4, anyway. Compared to the older drive this new one is just a tad thinner, and much lighter. I realize late in my intention that some older bios cannot handle a certain storage capacity, applying the last firmware/bios update for this \"Jesus\" - the 1Tb was able to run on the laptop with Win11pro, none-the-less. I was thrilled with the unexpected outcome, earlier I thought \"CRAP! - I should have taken the time to research my laptop's specs' profile!\", I was lucky that at the end of it all - everything worked out. I might add that originally, on Win10pro, the laptop seem to be just a smidge faster than on Win11pro, perhaps I have given the old \"bag-of-bones\" more than its hardware's limit, or it could just be me.",
