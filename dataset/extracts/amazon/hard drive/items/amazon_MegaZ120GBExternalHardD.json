                "reviewText": "I was using it to hold a bunch of files and safely unplugged it from my laptop the way that I do my other hard drive to move the files to my computer. Lucky for me, I still had a copy of all of these files on my laptop because when I plugged it into my computer, the damn thing just stopped working. The file window popped up for a second and then it was gone. I tried it on my laptop, nothing. I tried it on three other computers in the house and even tried it on an XBOX One to see if it would at least start the whirring noise that I can usually hear from it. Nothing! I was so frustrated! I haven't used it often enough for it to break, if anything I've probably used it around 4 times in total. I didn't keep it plugged into my laptop 24/7 because I move my laptop around a lot and was worried that I could cause a shortage in the cord - granted the cord is very thick, I just didn't want to risk it. I'm never buying this again, it was a total waste of money. It might've just been a one-time fatal error but I've never had something like this happen to me before with an external hard drive and it definitely wasn't something I was prepared for. I'm past the time I could get a refund but if I hadn't been able to retrieve those files some other way, I don't think a refund would've been able to account for how much I actually would've lost. I guess, be careful while on the Internet buying things. Nothing is incapable of failing.",
