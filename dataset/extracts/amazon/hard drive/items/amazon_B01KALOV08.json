Not ideal, but good enough for the purpose. I have since reformatted them and am using one right now as my interim main drive on a Linux box. The other drive has been formatted with NTFS (Windows 10) for use as an offline backup drive. Both drives are working well in their new functions. As these are ex-7200 RPM Apple-branded drives, I had to use a partition editor to thoroughly wipe the previous partitions to allow the one to be readable by Windows and prevent the second drive from interfering with my Linux installation process. As-shipped, they are not readable by Windows. This may be the source of complaints by some of the other reviewers. YMMV, but my drives are both working well and you can\u2019t touch the price. I have since bought two more.",

Computer runs like new. It was the failing hard drive with bad sectors that was making it sluggish before the ultimate crash.I ordered from this vendor after originally ordering from another vendor that had lack of communication, cancelled order. I chose this vendor. Item was packed in a box with padding...packaged superbly and fast.This vendor is excellentThe other vendors hard drive came later...no box in a thin amazon bag..not even padded, I can only imagine how bad that was banged around..sent it back",
