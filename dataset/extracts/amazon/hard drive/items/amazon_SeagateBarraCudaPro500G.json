                "reviewText": "My Unifi Cloud key Gen2 plus came with a 1TB hard drive. After five years of continuous use it was becoming slower and less predictable in connecting to the Unifi Portal.As was somewhat apprehensive about using an SSD as they are more expensive and have a finite read/write capacity.The problem with a larger capacity hard drive is that the 2.5 inch format is limiting. Ideally, one should choose a CMR drive for an NVR. However, the only CMR 2.5 inch drive is the 1TB Toshiba. If you want a larger drive, you end up with an SMR drive. That will decrease the longevity of the drive. As they say, mileage may vary....If only Unifi allowed a 3.5 inch drive, but they don't and there is no workaround other than MacGyvering an external interface.This drive is fast, is essentially plug and play, and is working without a hitch.Just remember to confirm there is a recent backup of the Unifi operating system or you will lose all the camera and other hardware connections.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good so far for virtual storage pool",
                "reviewText": "I'm running five of these in my virtual storage pool (Windows Server 2016 storage pool) for my home server, four months so far. One drive developed two bad sectors, a reformat mapped them out. Maybe in another six months I'll trust them as much as the WD Red drives they replaced - until then all my volumes are three-way mirror, and I have offsite backups.Temperatures are low, of course - a main advantage of going to 2.5\" drives. And these are pretty much silent. Not the fastest kid on the block - no surprise there. Still, I see less impact from SMR than I expected.It's interesting to note that the external version of this 5TB drive contains the exact same drive. Everything except drive serial number is exactly the same externally, as well as firmware and any other params I could inspect with HD Tune. At the time of writing the price for an external drive is 119 vs 189 for this internal version. Of course, pulling out the drive from the external enclosure voids any warranty, so it's really a question of how much the warranty is worth. Will more than one out of three drives fail during the warranty period?UPDATE 8/17/2018: All five drives have been running well since January. I wiped and reformatted them back then before redeploying. I have a spare drive but am not bothering with hot swap as uptime is not critical for my home server - I can accept a day's downtime if a drive fails hard. These little drives are performing as well as can be expected. Raising to five stars.UPDATE 12/16/2018: It's been a year now for most of my drives. Still running well. One drive has disconnected from my SAS card twice, hard to tell if it's the drive, card or cabling. In the process I got to see how well double redundancy works - the storage pool didn't even flinch, no downtime, no readonly mode, just rebuilt redundancy using free space on other drives while on single redundancy for a few hours. I ejected and reinserted the disconnected drive, and everything was back to normal again (albeit a bit unbalanced free space).",

                "reviewText": "I needed this exact drive to replace a failed drive in a raid. It was a good price and it arrived fairly quickly. I stuck it into my raid, and it synced. All good.All of that being said, why did I drop a star from the rating? The drive was shipped in a paper envelope, with nothing but some bubblewrap (fairly thin, as well) around it. I have never seen a drive shipped with so little protection, and almost expected it to fail outright.Like I said, I will be keeping an eye on it, and would happy pay a few bucks more to protect my investment more than some thin bubblewrap in a paper envelope.",

                "reviewText": "This Review Is Specifically For The: \"Seagate 1TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 128MB Cache 2.5-Inch 7mm Internal Hard Drive (ST1000LM048)\"It's Fast For A 5400 RPM Drive But I Think It Only Works With USB 3.0 Or Above Cables... I Have 2 USB 2.0 And An Enclosure And It Won't Work At All With Them.... Fortunately, I Also Bought A StarTech USB 3.0 to 2.5\" SATA III Hard Drive Adapter Cable At The Same Time And It Works With It Just Fine.... It Also Works Great Installed In My Toshiba Satellite C655 Laptop (It's Ultimate Purpose Of Course)....NOW - Keep In Mind ALL Hard Drives/ Disk Drives Can Fail... AND If They're Going To Fail, They Usually Fail Within The First 6 - 9 Months Of Regular Use... SO - Back Up Everything For The First Year Or So On ALL New Drives.... (Actually, You Should Be Doing That Anyway All The Time...) If The Drive Lasts Longer Than 9 Months To A Year, It's A Good Chance The Drive Is Fine And Will Last The Normal Mean Time Between Failures Of Something Like 800,000 Hours Or So... BUT Keep In Mind, Anything Can Happen....ALSO NOTE - THE DRIVE COMES BLANK - They All Do As Far As I Know.....I Don't Know If You Need To Format It Because The Recovery Thumb Drive Did All That Good Stuff For Me Automatically....I Installed It In My Laptop And Inserted The USB Thumb Drive Recovery Thingy I Made Following Toshiba's Instructions... It Took A While But Not Too Long (Naturally, We're Talking Like 13GB Here For Windows 7 From A USB 2.0 Thumb Drive...) And I'm Back To \"Out Of The Box\" New Again, Except With A Ridiculously Large Drive....LOL Old Drives A 300GB....I Don't Know About Warranties Or Fakes Like Some Reviews Are Talking About, But Mine Has A Green Label And Came Sealed In A New Looking Anti-static Pouch...",
