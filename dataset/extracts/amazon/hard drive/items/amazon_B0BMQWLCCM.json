                "reviewText": "It vibrates noticeable when on a large wooden table. It gets warmer for my expectations and it does work flawless! What I don't understand is why there is no Toshiba label like in the Amazon picture. The label is like off brand, like I would print myself if not motivated to a better label. Kind of shocking but then again what do I care about the sort of a label, my worry is reliability, ability to read and transfer data with no mistakes. Windows 10 I use (x32 bit) is definitely not up to the task, though. Sometimes I think that Windows 10 is not the best to transfer data but the hard drive is flawless!!! I switched to win 10 x64 and had no problems at all, except for windows 10 being too over protective (good luck trying to disable the antivirus (successfully) on windows 10 x 64).Why does it vibrate? Motor, materials and the hard rubber standoffs. I put it into an Amazon enclosure and the vibration vanished (although the enclosure itself has problems with weak fan and rubber standoffs).I purchased a temp reader on Amazon to have a better understanding of operating temperature. With that type of disk size one must be vigilant but I never had a failed Toshiba drive yet and certainly don't expect it with this hard drive. Thank you Toshiba and Amazon!!!Incredible quality. Thank you Amazon and Amazon delivery person/system!!!!Jan 23 2024 I made few corrections to the text above, Windows 10 x64 works very well, that unswitchable sob antivirus keeps interacting, tried everything; the Toshiba hard drive is FLAWLESS (have I said FLAWLESS?). I purchased a 3.5\" hard drive travel/storage case on Amazon and I am glad I did: while travelling, I kept praising myself for not being cheap and buying the protective case, the name is Orico, please look it up on Amazon, well worth the money even if you don't travel, for travellers it is an absolute must have. Again, Toshiba hard drives, all of them are the best quality, I have never (have I said already NEVER?) lost a Toshiba hard drive and have a whole tub of NotToBeMentionedByName hard drives, everything you can name is in that sorry tub-RIP, kept for historical purposes. Yes, you bet, I keep trying to advertise the Toshiba Hard drive, no matter what capacity; they do always work- have I said, FLAWLESS???",

                "reviewText": "NOTE: I've seen many people complain about drives because they're \"fake\" and only have 2048 GB. The drive is not fake. 2048GB is a limitation of the old MBR partition format, and if you initialize/format the drive with MBR you will see a 2TB partition! All you need to do to fix this is right click on the drive number in Windows Disk Management (get there from the start menu via Computer Management or \"Create and format hard disk partitions\"), click \"Convert to GTP\", and reformat the drive.I needed to replace several 6-year-old 6TB drives, and these were the natural choice. FC-MAMR is, of course, new tech, but I am expecting these to be reliable: a media that requires a stronger magnetic recording field means more energy is required to flip individual magnetic bits, so they should be less likely to flip on their own.Otherwise, the drives run exactly like you'd expect any other drive to run: plug it in and go. They aren't any noisier than any of my other drives and I have been transferring data to them non-stop since installation and haven't encountered any problems or unexpected behavior.Great job, Toshiba!",

I have always had good luck with Toshiba in the past but this is absolutely mind-blowing. A premium price for a poorlyperforming product. I have no clue how they're going to be able to sell these. I'm off the Toshiba wagon!",

                "reviewText": "I'm new to Toshiba drives (have lots of Seagate and WD), but these drives lack a SMART conveyance test, which is the first thing I run when I get new drives to check for shipping damage. Instead, I ran the long test on them. Here's another difference. On Seagate/WD, while a long test is running, there's an entry in the test results stating that a test is ongoing, and what % is left. And if a drive loses power, when it gets power again, it'll resume the test where it left off. On these drives, there's no entry in the test results until the test completes, and if the drive loses power, it'll forget it was testing.Other than those quirks, SMART output shows that these drives are brand new with 0 hours and the long tests completed on them without issue. FYI, the polling time recommended for the long test results was 15xx minutes (25-26 hours), but the tests actually finished in about 22 hours.",
