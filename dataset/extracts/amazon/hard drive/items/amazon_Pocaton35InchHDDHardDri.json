That\u2019s precisely my purpose, and it does it really well.The caddy has posts that fit in the drive\u2019s mounting holes - you flex the whole caddy to get the posts to line up with the holes - and it slides into Dell\u2019s proprietary(ish) slide-in mounts, latching securely.It\u2019s a simple device, but it has to fit both the drive and the mounting rails, so it\u2019s sort of important to get the right part.

I have broken several of these brackets either because they become brittle with age and crack when flexed to insert or remove a drive, or because the pins pop out of the plastic breaking the little retaining tooth. I did not feel like either case was going to be a problem with this caddie. I would (and probably actually will) purchase this again.",
