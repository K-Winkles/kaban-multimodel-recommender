                "reviewText": "I directly copied over my O.S. (Operating system) from a mechanical Hard drive (HD) to the SSD using Macrium Reflect. The boot time of Windows 10 / 64-bit is never \"speedy\" {even with the SSD - about 20-25 seconds from BIOS logo to windows login}.The noticeable speed difference will come when you launch bulky applications like: Photoshop, games, photos, etc. Boot time will vary depending on different factors.The Silicon SDD speeds are the same as the Samsun 860 EVO 1TB (Up to 550/520MB/s seq read/write speeds). My tests are showing A55-1TB Silicone SSD with 550/440MB/s (screenshot posted with this review). My speeds are not tested with an \"Empty\" drive the A55/SSD was tested with a fully functioning OS on it (20% of the drive filled during testing). This is a fast drive at a reasonable price.IF, anything should occur with the hard drive over a period of time I will return to update this review (if possible). I am using three different variants of the Silicone SSD: 1TB, 480GB, and 256GB. (desktop, laptop, desktop) All three SSD drives are meeting or exceeding their competition's speeds.A note to all Windows users, please change your advance settings / hard disk timeout in your control panel unless you don't care about very noticeable lag spikes when you open or launch applications/documents. This is under \"control panel\", top right search box type \"power\", left window \"Edit power plan\". \"Change advanced power settings\", Expand \"Hard disk\" by clicking on the + symbol to the left of it. Click on the + symbol to the left of \"turn off hard disk after\", click on \"Setting\" change to 0 minutes. (do this for M.2/NVME/SSD) otherwise you will wonder why your highspeed drive is acting \"slow\".UPDATE: I have now purchased about 5 Silicon SSD (2.5) drives. ALL 5 are still working very well 5 months in. I have done speed tests on a few of them every month (I have multiple sizes: 256, 512, 480, 1TB) The speeds are stable. Meaning you will get a slight variation (either faster or slow) in the speed test numbers but nothing dramatic. If you are concerned about data loss, get a second hard drive (mechanical if you wish). Go get Macrium Reflect, home edition, and you can make a direct copy of your OS boot drive into an image file. Macrium is a UK based software company that has powerful free (home edition) software. YouTube has wonderful videos on how to do this, very simple. Remember to buy a USB stick (2GB more than enough) to make a media boot for recovery purposes.",

With 1TB of storage space, in comparison to 250gb I had, I don't have to worry about running out of room for programs and files either. Reliable performance in a compact design at a great value. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "4 TB als SSD kommt preislich in einen Bereich, in dem man auch 4 TB NAS Festplatten kriegt. Diese sind aber gemessen an der Kapazit\u00e4t vollkommen \u00fcberteuert, tlw sogar teurer wie die WD Red Pro.Was ist also naheliegender wie vier SSDs in ein NAS zu stecken und ein RAID zu machen? Rapid Array of Inexpensive Disks hei\u00dft die Abk\u00fcrzung... schnelles Array aus billigen Festplatten.Ich hab sie derzeit in einem Server verbaut, der leider nur SATA 3G kann, aber die Daten\u00fcbertragunsraten waren gut, entweder bis an die technsichen Limits, bis auf die 4K Random Benchmarks. Den vernachl\u00e4ssige ich aber, da moderne Betriebsysteme wie auch NAS Ger\u00e4te die Daten so organisieren, da\u00df sie fortlaufend gelesen werden k\u00f6nnen. Das Zugriffsmuster 4K Random wird also eher selten auftreten.Ich hatte mal ein NVME von Fanxing - das gemeinerweise mit einem DRAM Cache ausgestattet war und wenn der voll war gings schon beim linearen SChreiben mit 5-20 MB/Sekunde weiter. Vollkommen inakeztabel, aber die Silicon Power SSD zeigt auch im halbvollen Zustand noch gute Leistungsdaten, 120-150 MB/Sekunde. Ich werde mir noch drei davon kaufen und in eine Synology DS414 einbauen. Berichten anderer Silicon Power K\u00e4ufer zufolge geht das.",
