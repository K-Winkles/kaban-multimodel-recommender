                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great secondary mass-storage drive.",
                "reviewText": "I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase of this drive. I am very happy with the results that I was able to achieve especially for a drive without a DRAM cache.The drive is in an M.2 2280 form factor so keep that in mind when choosing a drive for a laptop or other small device, as it may be too long, so be sure to check the compatibility with the manual of the device you plan to put it in. This drive WILL fit in a PlayStation 5, but is not fast enough to recommend for said use case.I recommend this drive to those needing a large and modern drive but at a very good price. Ideal use cases would be for game libraries or security camera video storage.Reasons to recommend:- Great price from a reputable brand- PCIe gen 4 which is a steal at this price- Great speeds considering the lack of DRAM cache- No required heat sinkReasons to avoid:- 1TB is not a lot in today's world; for this price you can easily find a 2TB hard disk drive- No DRAM cache- Speeds are good, but not great- Installation can be more in-depth than something like an external hard driveInto the nitty-gritty.I ordered this as a secondary drive for my Dell XPS 9710. This laptop has two PCIe 4x4 slots that will accommodate a 2280 M.2 expansion card. I did not need anything too fast, just extra storage for game libraries and creative files (Photoshop, Blender, Premiere, Ableton, and the like).The packaging was very small and minimal but still good quality. My drive had a different color PCB - a very dark blue/black. While not an issue (I actually prefer it), it is worth noting. The serial number is correct and it is the same drive as sold on Amazon. Installation was a breeze and the drive is sized properly.Going by the benchmarks that I ran, the primary use of this drive should be items that will not be randomly accessed. I would not recommend this as a primary drive for a computer or running an operating system on this. Storing documents, games, or other file types that will be loaded sequentially into RAM when accessed will work great here.Average sequential reads according to CrystalDiskMark were about 3500GB/s and average sequential writes were about 2570GB/s. These write speeds are as advertised, but be aware that there is a reason write speeds are not advertised - the lack of DRAM cache is hurting them a lot.Average sequential reads according to Atto were HEAVILY favored to larger queries, and you can expect full speeds at 512KB queries or larger. Average optimal reads are about 3000GB/s and average optimal writes were about 2400GB/s. These read speeds are significantly lower than CrystalDiskMark's findings and less than advertised.I rate this product overall 4.5/5 stars due to its absolute steal of a price for what you get. I would prefer the inclusion of a DRAM cache, but it is hard to complain.If you buy this as a secondary drive for someone on a budget, you won't be disappointed.",

I've received two different batches of HP desktops where the OEM drives start failing within 2 months of use, and these little Kingston drives are the cure (because who wants to deal with HP warranty support, am I right?).Cheap to acquire and easy to install, these drives aren't winning any speed awards or beauty contests, but for home use or a standard business environment they're more than enough to satisfy. They don't come with any \"migration software\" like a Samsung drive might, and they lack any hardware (though your PC or motherboard should already have the mounting screws included), but they're solid little drives that I've had in at least 20 machines for over a year without issue.",

                "reviewText": "These do work in my \"old\" Mid 2010 MacPro !!!!These are AWESOME and fast M.2 drives, 2TB for $110 !!!! So I have an \"old\" Mid 2010 MacPro and I bought the 4 slot M.2 card for $30, \"KONYEAD pcie4.0 x16 to m.2 m-Key nvme x 4 ssd Expansion Card\" (Amazon ASIN #: B09XSY3JVS) and together they give me 1,700MBs R/W in Windows 10 (Bootcamp) and for some reason slower, but fast enough for my needs 700MBs R/W. To get fast, 2TB M.2 storage for $140 is amazing, plus I can add another 6TB of storage for another $330! Just like a year ago, this would have cost me $2k to $3K for the same thing. Fast drives are essential for Film/TV Editing! And all else, like Apple Apps I develop and EXCELLENT for GAMING (I edit and do my biz in Mac, then boot to Windows 10 for Gaming, BF1, 4, 5, Racing Simulators, Flight Simulators.... all McPC!!!!)I edit projects and to keep cost down I've been using the absolute worst (used to trust WD) Western Digital USB hard drives, which are slow and only last about 3 months, then they fail. They start off at 70MBs, then after 3 months slow to 2MBs to 5Mbs!!!! WAY TOO SLOW TO EDIT WITH!!!! WD used to be my go to drives for reliability, but these have been the worst!!!!! (WD 5TB My Passport Ultra for Mac Silver Portable External Hard Drive HDD = THE WORST DRIVES EVERY!!!!).AND last year when I looked at M.2 PCIe cards for my MacPro, the card alone was like $1,300 and M.2 were pricey. NOW this card at $30 and the 2TB M.2 Kingston drives at $110, $140, brings the price within my budget!I wanted faster than the SSD drives I am using now and this is the perfect solution.One thing though, for some reason my MacPro won't boot Windows 10 Bootcamp off this card?AND also for some reason the R/W speed in MacOS is \u00bd the speed of Windows 10.... same computer, but a reboot? And lastly, I have not tried RAID of this card and these M.2 drives, but should work, right?Later!JOHNAVATAR.com",
