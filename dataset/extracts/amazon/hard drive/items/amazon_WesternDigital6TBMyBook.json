                "reviewText": "This is my second WD My Book. The first is still running after almost ten years of constant use (albeit more slowly, lol). This newer drive is performing just as well, though I have the same complaints with it as I did with the older version - the cable slips out of the slot in the back too easily, and the drive cycles up too slowly after going to sleep mode. But it's a nearly five year old USB HDD and it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and consistently.I'll likely never buy an HDD drive again (all SSD for me, now), but if you're in the market for a less expensive USB drive, the MyBook series will do well for you.",

                "reviewText": "I have an embarrassingly large number of backup drives. Part of it is as a commercial photographer it\u2019s a necessity \u2013 at last count I have something approaching a quarter of a million photos in my lifetime file. The other reason is I\u2019ve learned the hard way to back up all of my work, then back it up again, and then make sure to make another backup to take off premises for safety. This is my third WD MyBook. There\u2019s no real reason this product exists, there are cheaper ways to get a backup drive and use it with a computer, but these are convenient, dependable and reasonably priced. I bought this one to do a mega consolidation of everything I have on many different media, except for my photography.WHAT I LIKEThe form factor is simple, just a plastic monolith case that can be used either horizontal or vertical. I choose to use it vertical to take up a minimal amount of desk space. I like to keep it right there in front of me as a visual reminder to be sure to do a daily backup.IMPROVEMENTSWD seems to have this product line down pat, it\u2019s old technology that has proven itself and there\u2019s not a lot they can do to make it better. The most positive thing I can say about it is that they wisely don\u2019t load it with a lot of useless bloatware to try to make it look more important to you. There are just two relatively small apps, one for PC and one for Mac for those who like to use backup software. Both files are easily deleted in seconds if you don\u2019t want them. I choose not to use automated backup software, I simply copy entire files and folders from one drive to another so there\u2019s no guessing where they are or what they\u2019re named.OPINIONI find it unfortunate that here we are deep into the twenty-first century and there are still reviews about how noisy or slow these drives are. Your\u2019re not saying anything new by bringing that up, yes they are, if that bothers you don\u2019t buy a hard drive with a spinning platter. There are those who will say, and count me in on that, mechanical hard drives continue to be used because they are the safest media we can use, the chances of recovering a corrupt or lost data file is highest with these than any other media. The method being used to use a moving recording head back and forth on a revolving disk is going to cause some noise and it\u2019s also going to be a bit on the slow side. I find that the speed is only a factor when I first get a drive and I\u2019m copying huge amounts of data to it, and yes that can take hours. After that most backups are cumulative and how long they take has never been an issue for me. And like I said, I keep my WD right in front of me on my desk and they\u2019ve reduced the vibration and noise to the point that it is almost imperceptible.Because this product does exactly what I expect it to do and because of my positive experience with the MyBook product line I believe this earns a full five stars.",

                "reviewText": "This is a review of the WD 6 TB My Book. As noted in my headline, the reviews here cover a multitude of products.I bought this drive to replace a WD 2TB My Passport that died after 38 months - much to my disappointment - a drive that I used to store movies - which are now lost due to PCB failure (not mechanical) just sitting on my desktop and having never been dropped or transported, Sadly, WD PCB repair/replacement to recover data is not as straight forward as other drives. But I digress.I purchased this drive in October 2016 and use it - exclusively - for backup storage. By so doing, when this drive bricks, I will still have the originals, which I can backup again on a new drive. Given that I use it for backup storage only, and it never leaves my desk, speed and size is not an issue. Compared to portable USB drives this drive is subject to clunks and clicks but these are not objectionable. The 4-foot USB and 6-foot power cables adequately reach a USB hub and power receptacles.Hopefully,I will get my $193 worth out of it (we retired old guys tend to mind our pennies) to make it a worth while purchase. As of late I have discovered that, based on user experience and testing performance, internal hard drives tend to last much longer than external; indeed,many of the negative reviews here lament premature drive failure of this drive and its cousins. I built and have done a couple of upgrades on a gaming machine in which I placed three WD Caviar black drives that I have used and reused for almost 7 years without a hiccup. That my Passport drive did not make it to three years is disappointing.Given my experience and the reviews herein, my 4-star rating urges caution: this drive will serve (as long as it decides to serves) as an adequate backup drive - AS LONG AS - a second copy (original) is stored elsewhere which can be backed up when this drive fails. Regardless of what one's SMART assessment is, these drives can instantly die due to PCB failures.Ed",
