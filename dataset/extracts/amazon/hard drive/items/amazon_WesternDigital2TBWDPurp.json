                "reviewText": "I have a Lorex NVR for recording security footage. After just a few months the included HHD in the unit died without warning. It was a complete crash. The device was under warranty and the company would not replace the drive, but rather said they would replace the entire unit with a used/refurbished unit and that it would takes weeks. I decided to keep the device and just replace the drive myself so I wasn't without a security system for that long. This drive was on sale and is more than twice the capacity of the other brand of drive it replaced. It is extremely fast when searching for past security footage. If you are looking to replace a security system drive be sure to get one that is properly rated for this task. You can't just use any off the shelf hard drive or you will run into serious issues. These specialty drives exist for a reason, and this brand and model have done an excellent job so far, recording 24/7 for over a year now.",
