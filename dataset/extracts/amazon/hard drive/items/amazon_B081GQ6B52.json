After the first couple of days of use, the hard drive refused to show up on my laptop, and had to wait a good 10 mins. The External hard drive also has a loud irritating noise when plugged into your device so expect that. For the icon to pop up for me to access my photos. Sadly after in use for 3 weeks, the external hard-drive for no apparent reason just died on me. The icon never popped up again and the loud noise became fainter as time passed. I always clicked on the \"eject USB\" so that's taken out of the equation. I think the hard truth is that I lost all my photos on the External Hard drive. Hopefully, I can recover them with a data recovering company.",
