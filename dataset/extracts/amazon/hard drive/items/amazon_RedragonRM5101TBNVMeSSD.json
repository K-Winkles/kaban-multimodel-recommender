That said the drive is installed in an external enclosure that claims up to 40GBps transfer speed, utilizing 10GBps USB 3 port on the PC. But I'm only seeing 1GBps...Not sure if my setting are wrong, I ran the test wrong, or what exactly the issue is. No available internal slots to test this drive in, hence the enclosure, which I know limits performance.That said, the drive works, and is a reasonable price. Gets pretty warm, has a cheap heatsink similar to the thin aluminum seen in the picture, that is actually the heatsink that came with the enclosure, stuck on top of the stock drive heatsink, so it makes contact with the enclosure lid.I believe this drive should operate up to specs, I'm just not getting those speeds with the external setupRecommended.",

                "reviewText": "First off I'd like to say that I don't hate this SSD. It's fast, but I could not under any circumstance get it to deliver real world speeds close to what they say this drive can do. I know, I know, the top speeds of a drive are based on the absolute perfect scenario, but as you'll see in the included pics, their claims weren't even close.NOTE: The copy tests below were from an ADATA XPG GAMMIIX S70 Blade with max speeds of 7,400MBps Read and 6,800MBps write.The first test I did was copy a 40GB folder from a game to the Redragon SSD. It has a mix of large and small files. With that test I piqued at just a little over 2300 MB/s. The next test was one large 20GB file. This file allowed the drive to stretch it's legs a bit more and made it all the way to 3860 MB/s.The synthetic tests with Crystal Disk Mark show good speeds overall, but they fall short of the max reads and writes by nearly 1000 MB/s reads and over 1500 MB/s writes.That, in and of itself is not the problem for me at all. It's what they are charging for this 1TB drive. It's priced in the 2TB category. Unless the manufacturer lowers the price to be inline with the rest of the industry, I can not recommend this drive.The other negative for this drive is that they do not have an SSD Toolbox program like pretty much every other SSD drive manufacturer out there. I went searching high and low for the software too, but there was nothing to be found. In fact, I could not find ANY info on this drive outside of the Amazon product page. There wasn't even a blurb about it on Redragon's website, so I decided to contact them and they told me and I quote, \"Normally our SSD does not require software updates\".So does that mean their firmware is flawless then? Once they finish releasing an SSD they never work to make it faster, better, stronger? If that's the case, why would someone want to buy this SSD over one from a proven brand such as Samsung, Crucial or Western Digital who do have SSD software for checking the drives lifespan, it's reads and writes, the ability to secure erase it and yes, the ability to update to a new firmware that either fixes an issue or issues and/or makes the drive faster for the customer?In the end, the drive works just fine. I haven't had any issues and the warranty is a mostly industry standard 5 years, which is nice to see. It's just the price and the lack of software for firmware updates that has be bothered.",

                "reviewText": "I actually picked this up for my PS5. PS5 drives need to be very fast to keep the performance up and meet Sony's specs. This seems to be working.You can research an appropriate heat sink to pair with it. Installation wasn't too bad. Now I can hold a LOT of games, perfect since I sub to the Playstation monthly service as well.The drive also came nicely packaged. 2TB is a lot and would be great installed in a computer for games, video editing, photo storage, and more. Seems to be a great brand. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I have been running SATA 2.5\" SSDs since at least 2014, with my current one being about 7 years old, the rest of my PC is 3 years old. Sadly my MSI Z490 Edge Wifi motherboard does not support PCIE 4.0, oddly my i9-10850k CPU does support PCIE 4.0, which makes no sense to me. My bios defaulted to PCIE 3.0, and I appear to be getting nearly the max PCIE 3.0 speeds of 3389mb/sec read and 3300mb/sec write. Not supporting PCIE 4.0 was my fault and not the drives, I just cannot confirm the advertised speeds of this drive, only that if you have PCIE 3.0 it will work and is still incredibly fast. I can confirm the controller is an Innogrit capable of 7,400mb/sec read and the memory is TLC.",
