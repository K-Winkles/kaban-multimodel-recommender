                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a flash drive to connect to my Android cellphone. And the search did reveal some good candidates. But you needed an adapter to connect the drive to the phone.That is until I came across this flash drive.Note to iPhone users. This flash drive does not connect to iPhones.Note to Android users. The OTG (On The Go) must be engaged to connect the drive to your Android phone.Most likely, it is already on by default.The drive has USB and USB-C compatibility.Step one! Verification that the drive would connect to my A23 Android without an adapter.It did, and it did it well.I attached the flash drive to the phone while in sleep mode.The phone woke up and showed a USB device attached to it.Next came the test of the drive to transfer data.The transfer of 60.2 MB of photos from the drive to the phone went down perfectly.After un-mounting the drive from the phone, I transferred the same data to my computer.The data transfer was completed in a few seconds.One Mississippi, Two Mississippi, DoneProsI like the rotation function to go from one connector to the other.There is something called the Stuck Point design. It prevents the random rotation of the drive.The Android phone connector has a cap to protect it.The USB connector does not have a cap. Rotating it into the housing protects it.I like the keyring feature.So far, I have not found any problems with this flash drive. And I recommend it to Android and Mac users.I also recommend verifying that it will work with your device using an online search.My method is to copy/paste the title into the browser and ask, Does this (name of the product) work with (name of device)?This method usually works, but not always.",

                "reviewText": "I'll admit, I got this particular thumb drive because it was such a cool color--I love copper. I needed a way to transfer the things I write from my Chromebook, which I use on the road, to my desktop computer, since we've never been able to network our computers. The transfer speed is excellent. You can also transfer through USB C, which makes it more versatile.",
