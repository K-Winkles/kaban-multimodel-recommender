                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great NAS drives.",
                "reviewText": "I have been around computers since the mid 80's and remember purchasing my first hard drive. It was for my Apple II in an enclosure about half the size of the computer with a self-contained power supply, fans and all sorts of what were then, \"goodies\".It was an SCSI drive and it had a whopping 25 megabytes of space at my disposal. The hard drive was a Shugart, named after the fellow that built them and the predecessor of what is today, Seagate.There was a period of time in the 90's where my experiences with what were then the kingpins of hard drives, WD and Seagate simply did not prove reliable in a server or NAS environment which is why I always ended up paying top dollar for SCSI servers and enterprise drives that were significantly more expensive than an equivalent ATAPI desktop drive. When Samsung introduced their line of desktop drives, for the first time I felt comfortable using them in a server environment where they run 24/7.Today, after testing hard drives as they come out in both sizes and formats, I found that by far, WD has the best NAS drives for the money and they are not that much more expensive than a regular desktop drive. In fact, the WD Black line, which is intended for desktops is also a terrific drive and would not hesitate to stick them in a NAS box with one from their Red line.But I say so only from the point of view of reliability. As in the past I often found that anyone selling a non scuzzy drive claimed they were purpose built for a server environment, I questioned it as it seemed that I could not see any tangible evidence of them being anything more than the same drive as any other with a different label and a higher price.I can quantify the difference even between a WD Black drive and the Red NAS line. The transfer speeds are higher and they don't run nearly as hot which explains their great longevity under enterprise environment. There are still good reasons for going with enterprise scuzzy drives if that is what you need and can afford it. But for the everyday person that simply wants to keep their data backed up off site or off their PC, the WD Red line is a terrific drive and deliver a lot of bang for the buck.I presently have a location where I run 10 NAS boxes with two to four hard drives each and over time, the WD Red drives have outlasted Seagate's equivalents -- by a long shot. That is not meant to be a put down of Seagate because I use their hybrid drives on my desktops and they are terrific. I personally prefer them to WD's Black line even though I know they are also great drives.I must admit that I am baffled when I read about someone these days getting, say, 4 new drives and one or two being DOA. Maybe I've been fortunate, but I have purchased hundreds if not thousands of hard drives and I have yet to get one tha was DOA. Some clearly perform better than others and last longer than others, but as a whole, I would say the hard drive market is extremely mature and whether they are made in China or the US, makes no difference.All I can say is that in my experience and for my needs, the WD Red line is an excellent NAS drive and will continue to use them in the foreseeable future. Something else may come out that it is better or not. But when one is dealing with a NAS environment, there isn't much room for testing new equipment if the one I use now meets my needs and has proven itself.As my needs change, I will go through due diligence in determining what will be best. But at least presently, there are alternatives to SCSI if you do not need it and the prices per megabyte are lower than ever. I highly recommend this line of drives from WD for its intended use.",

I bought this one extra to have in case one of the original drives fails. I am impressed with their durability and speed as good as any other brand's hard drives.",

                "reviewText": "I would never buy a Western Digital Red drive to game on, it was bought just for pure storage of stuff that was not going to be changed much.When buying a drive make sure its a CMR based drive and not a SMR based drive. While SMR drives can make drives cheaper, reliability and speed suffer. The version of drive I got for CMR which is exactly what I wanted. I have it in a hot swap bay which is not plugged in all the time so it should last a long time.Will get more once I need more storage space.",
