It came preformatted with fat32 which is what works best with Android apps. I had tried larger NTFS and ExFat formatted (2TB) drives that would not work because they were too big to be formatted with fat32 and Android file system would not work with ExFat or NTFS on the larger drive for whatever reason. ExFat did work on some other 120 GB drives I tried though. I have 2 Bipra S3 2.5 inch USB 3.0 FAT32 drives and 2 different 120 GB drives each attached to 4 separate TVs for use with Android apps. All 4 work fine but the Bipra drives are 340 GB drives for the same price. This is plenty of space for apps. Kodi takes over 4GB by itself which is why I needed the drive in the first place.",

The connection interface was the standard micro USB, in fact I had not seen this type of connection before. There was no warranty information on the Amazon purchase page and no answers to how long the warranty period is. I havehad to contact the company's sales department by email to see if I can ascertain the actual warranty period.They list no warranty period on their home web page. No warrant information either location is a little odd.Other than that the unit connected to my laptop and seemed to transfer data quickly.",

After purchasing this product and watching a YouTube tutorial by Britec09 i learned how to format the drive to FAT32 as i had wanted it shipped. The funny part here is that i already had other drives i could\u2019ve done this with therefore making this purchase completely unnecessary for me.I\u2019m only docking one star because I was able to fix its biggest issue in about five minutes. Giving credit where credit is due, it does work otherwise. If you\u2019re looking for a hard drive specifically 320GB and the formatting of said drive is trivial to you, then this should work just fine for you. However if you\u2019re looking for a FAT32 drive in particular, be aware that you will need to take extra steps if you buy this drive.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Buyers beware - you may not get the hard drive specified to your order",
                "reviewText": "I purchased a FAT32 format, 250 GB drive. I received a 320 GB drive that can only be formatted to NFST or exFAT formats. For the purpose of my order in the first place, this pretty much renders it half-useless, as I needed a drive that was \"specified to each order\" (or whatever the stupid box says) and intended for FAT32 like this said it was supposed to be. Not only is it not intended for use as a FAT32 drive, I cannot program it to FAT32 and exFAT only works for half of what I intended it for (backing up Wii and GameCube games--exFAT will kind of work with GameCube games, but not properly, and NTFS will load up all Wii games that I have tried correctly. However, without the ability to format this drive into FAT32, I am unable to do both things without switching between formatting, which is a gigantic pain in the ass. Furthermore, I intended for this drive to initially be used as a backup drive for computer files while I cleaned through my data and files, and that is what it currently is. I did not notice they sent me the wrong drive until two or three days after I had backed up a ton of files, basically putting myself in a position where it is easier to just order a new drive if Amazon won't assist me. I can't really delete the data I've already backed up--so I'm backed into a corner as I cannot return this drive and it took me too long to realize it cannot be formatted to FAT32.... I digress- I did order a smaller HD that was advertised clear as day on this page as FAT32 formattable, which is the one thing it is not. Before placing an order, or at least (if you're like me, anyway) before loading it up with a bunch of files you're backing up for a short-term project, make sure you received the hard drive in the description. I am very displeased with my purchase and if not for the fact that I have invested hours in backing up drives (while just kind of assuming it came formatted in FAT32 since it is plug & play, let alone that it would be the one format the drive I did receive cannot be formatted into by the time I realized it wasn't in FAT32 as it advertised. One last note: while the box specifies that each hard drive is designed to be formatted specifically for each order or something like that, it does not offer much else in the way of details about the product itself. It shows hard drive size (my first sign that something wasn't right.... 320 GB when this says 250....), USB interface (3.0 when I believed this one to be 1.1..... not complaining about that or the extra hard drive space, but it still wasn't what I ordered from this page as it is advertised), and I want to say that is really all of the info you get. I may be mistaking and there may be something on the back about the type of hard drive it is, but it does say in rather small print on the front something about the drive being \"specified to each order\" and it clearly was not in this case. Most disappointing of all things is the fact that the title for this listing clearly says FAT32 in it, and it's not like it comes formatted in something else--it outright will not format to FAT32. I don't believe it is possible. So essentially, I'm going to have to waste another $19 because of blatantly dishonest or inaccurate advertisement (neither is a valid excuse) with my only error being the fact that I trusted what I was purchasing from a site I spend more money on every single year, and then wonder why...Pros:A solid amount of space (320 GB) for $19, but you can get a whole lot more without having to pay a lot more than $25, if much more at all even. I sacrificed extra space for a product listed on a compatibility chart as guaranteed to work, possibly paying a bit more as a result, and they did not send me the product that is being listed. This listing may not even be for the item shown anymore, so again, please look at when this review was published before considering a purchase, and if you do make a purchase, check the box and the drive itself before dedicating too much time into it like I did. I'm sure you can find the proper FAT32 drive, but I am not going to be buying from this brand again--there is no guarantee they won't do the same thing again, and returns have become a bigger hassle than ever before.- USB 3.0 (somewhere in this listing, I think it advertises 1.1, but mine was 3.0 and it does copy data very quickly onto the device and from it)- According to the back of the box, it is compatible with a Sony PS3, so NTFS files or exFAT files must not conflict with PS3's hardware. I do have a modded PS3, so if nothing else, I can always look into seeing how exactly this is meant to function with a PS3. But it shows a PS3 logo on the back, and while I'm unsure if this is quite100% true, because I really am not sure how the drive is meant to function (an extra hard drive? Something to hold PS1 .bin and .que games for people low on system space? Can you install a PS2 (or PS1) game directly onto this hard drive like you could by making a pkg on the PS3's regular drive? These are all things I haven't even had a chance to try, and if a lot of this stuff proves more difficult than just using a flash stick or finding a better hard drive for a PS3 even, I should note now (if it isn't already obvious that I'm displeased) that this 3 star review would probably automatically dip to a 1, since inevitably all I can think of is to use this with my PS3 since there aren't nearly enough Wii games I own or desire to play in order to fill up a 320 GB hard drive. I don't even need 1/4th of that space to backup my computer. That is a temporary project, anyhow, as this was meant to be used with my Wii and GameCube simultaneously. Since that can't be done, if it is nothing more than a way to transfer data onto a PS3 and does not act as a second hard drive of sorts for it instead, then this thing is a complete waste of money and everything I wrote except the USB speed takes a hit.- It is 100% plug & play, which I like a lot. Very small and discreet and does not take up a lot of room at all. I have a 12\" laptop monitor and I run my laptop into a 32\" TV monitor because of my eyesight, and the drive is barely noticeable on top of my laptop's keyboard sitting neatly, even with the laptop being a very small notebook-style model. The drive is nice, which means their other drives are likely well-made and discreet as well, but there's a risk you might end up with nothing more than a nice shell for something you can't really use... Note: don't let the plug & play trick you into forgetting to check what format your drive ships in, and what formats it can be formatted into upon first plugging it in. Like an idiot, I waited for 2 days until I actually tried it out with some stuff which made me realize immediately that it was likely in the wrong format, to only at this point realize it wasn't FAT32 at all. Plug and play will work right out of the box and I was in a hurried nature at the time and wanted to copy some files over from my main hard drive that I had to delete quickly.Cons:- Item being advertised is not the item they sent. As noted, I received a larger drive, but different format. USB speed seemed to differ from this listing's as well. At least it was the same brand, and not a complete knock-off? It has been that bad before...- Can only be formatted to NTFS or exFAT, unless I am missing something. I have tried to format to FAT32 and it simply does not even populate as an option, and if each hard drive is catered specifically, that does not surprise me too much. Not the item being advertised as a FAT32 drive at all.- You can get a lot more space for $19, come to think of it. This is a solid brand from everything I have read, leading into the purchase and reading reviews on here beforehand as well. But if the listing is inaccurate or companies don't send the proper product, it doesn't matter how good a brand is. It's like ordering pork chops and having the waiter bring you a steak, and telling you it's just as good because they're the same brand of meat. Either I'm a blip on the unlucky radar, or this listing is no longer sending the valid product being shown. I am writing this review as somebody who rarely ever leaves a review because I wouldn't want to waste $19 when there are so many other reputable brands of hard drives (and more common ones for a few extra bucks even) that are less likely to make a mistake like this in the first place, leading to a mediocre and back-and-forth review for this thing.TLDR: They sent a drive that is meant to be used with NTFS or exFAT formats, and cannot be formatted to FAT32, the format which it is being advertised as. In addition, it does not match other specifications that this listing displays. Furthermore, the box doesn't go out of the way to let you know, so if you don't format your drive the second you open it (it is plug and play, a nice thing, but also a potential trap) or check the format it is in, you may end up with the wrong type of hard drive and $20 down the drain. I don't know if this is a one-time thing or if the company sends the wrong specified drives to people often, but I've seen this happen with other types of electronic products before. I would simply end with: buyer beware. Message amazon beforehand just to be safe. There are a lot of different drive types being sold by this company, so ensure you are going to receive the proper one to fit your needs or that you have received if you choose to take the plunge. I'd be happy with my purchase and it would likely be 5 stars if not for complete misinformation and no resolution from amazon.",
