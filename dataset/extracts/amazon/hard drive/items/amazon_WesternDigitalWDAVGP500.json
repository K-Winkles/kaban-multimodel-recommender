Well, that person definitely got lucky because all I got were headaches with this WD drive.The drive arrived defective with the dreaded \"clicking of death\" when I tried to run it through my HDD adapter. I thought it might have been my adapter but no because I took out a WD green 1tb from another computer of mine and it works perfectly fine. It connected to the computer just fine with no clicks whatsoever.I sent this back, got my money back, and went to Frys in-person and bought a WD purple 1 tb instead. A bit more expensive but the drive works flawlessly and I have a hard drive failure warranty from Frys, which is more reassuring than returning the product in the mail and hoping for your money back.",

I had an old 2.5 SATA from a laptop that failed, tried it in the Annke, and amazingly it works great, so that tells me there's something about this drive that the system doesn't like. I wish I had another way of checking it, but, I don't. So the only thing different I should've done was contact both dealers to make sure it was compatible before I purchased it. Product was well packaged and came with everything you need to get it installed, as far as that, and the support, that's amazing for the $18 dollars!",
