It would always rebuild database on boot and sometimes would sometimes corrupt ps4 update files. I had to initialize my ps4 two times this year. So how did I fix this? Well I bought this hard drive and I haven't had an issues yet. So far im impressed with the product. The instructions are easy to understand, installation was easy, the seller even gives you warranty card in the package. For now it only 4 stars because I only had it about 2 months. Might fix the review within 10 months or less.",
