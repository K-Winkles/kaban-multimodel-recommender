I'm not going to bore you with charts or graphs with benchmark photos that I'm sure are already plentiful. I will state that going from a Gen 3 SSD to fully supported Gen 4 NVMe M.2 drive is physically noticeable. OS Boot to login and desktop is quicker, app load times quicker, no noticeable heat throttling with the heat spreader and heat sink cover. For the price this little jewel comes at, I have no problem recommending it to any gaming enthusiast, hobbyist, photo or video editor, pretty much anyone on a shoestring budget looking for a cost effective solution.",
