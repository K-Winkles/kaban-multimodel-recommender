My other seagate same exact model ST6000NM0115 3.5\"-Inch HDD 6TB 7200 RPM 512e SATA 6Gb/s 256MB failed with less than a year on it. So why did I purchase the same model again - so I can raid the units together for a mirror and protect my data. Stick with Western Digital .. my other long term drives are WD. I took the chance with Seagate for the price ..",
