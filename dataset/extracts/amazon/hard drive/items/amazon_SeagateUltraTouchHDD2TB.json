Once I went through the downloaded installer and was able to go to the Time Machine in my system preferences and check this as my preferred backup device. The first backup is a little over one hour but I have a lot to download so the time to do this is fine with me. I also liked the fact that it came with a USB-C adaptor so I didn't have to go to an Apple dongle. I have used G Drives in the past but the prices are extremely high now if all you are doing is backing up to your personal computer. I am not a tech savvy person but I didn't need any tech support to get this running.",

                "reviewText": "I loved this thing since I got it at the tail end of 2019. I save all my important docs, pictures, emulators, etc on this drive. I do not use it for automated backup and I use a Miscrosoft Surface Book 2. My issue with this hard drive is sometimes it takes a while for it to load after putting in my password. The high probability of constantly troubleshooting and losing all of my precious data freaks me out. I can deal with unplugging and re-plugging once or twice to get it to work. Tonight I tried to get it to load for 3 hours, doing combinations of laptop restarts, unplugging and re-plugging, switching power cords, trying to use Toolkit to deactivate the password feature (that's where it always seems to freeze and stop responding). It seems like it doesn't stay powered on long enough through the loading process and just stops responding. I have not tried calling customer support yet as it's almost 23:00 EST as of this writing, but I may try tomorrow. If it is something that is easily fixed, I would love to give it 5 stars.UPDATE 2/22/21: I was finally able to disable password encryption and no issues! 4 stars only because I'm not sure if it will act up again when I re-enable it.",
