                "reviewText": "Updated - I plugged this into my usb-c port with an adapter and I'm getting much better speeds now. Closer to 550mb/s so perhaps it is just my USB-A ports aren't up to snuff. Original review below.Original Review:I'm using this on a Mac running OS X 13.2.1. I'm getting speeds around 400m/s read and write which is completely acceptable for my usage.I'm really just using this as an intermittent backup solution for my photo library. Generally speaking, I just plug it in, replicate my library to it, and put it back in a safe place. That said, it is very quick for a flash drive and much faster than my standard USB spinning disk storage. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance. However, I did notice that it would slow down considerably after a large transfer (to about a 1/3 of the advertised speed). The drive itself gets very warm, which is probably a good thing for appropriate heat dissipation but the speed seems to stay lower at least until I unplug / replug it into my computer.The enclosure itself is a nice hard metal housing. I doubt anyone would very easily be able to accidentally crush it from normal use or by having it dangling on a keychain. However, the part that generally gets the most abuse, the actual USB connector is, isn't reinforced but is covered by a cap that seems somewhat secure.One thing that I think should be included to make this a much more versatile drive is to include a USB-C adapter or perhaps, make the drive USB-C with a USB-A adapter. Clearly, USB-C is the port nearly all devices will end up using in the near future, so sticking with a larger USB-A kind of keeps it trapped in the past.Overall, this isn't a bad drive. I quite like the build quality and the capacity. The speed is decent (when actually running at maximum levels) and allows me to transfer my photo library quickly without too much fuss. I just wish it was a bit more versatile or forward thinking.My Star Rating Guide:--------------------------------------------------------------------\u2605 - Low Quality / fundamentally flawed product - I do not recommend it at all\u2605\u2605 - Poor Quality - Works, but is disappointing for various reasons.\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Decent Quality - Is what it claims to be but there may be better options.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very Good - Worth considering.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Excellent - I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Today I'm reviewing this Solid-state USB drive in the 1TB size by LQH tech,We're going to go ahead and take a quick look at this. Immediately this feels much heavier than you might expect. It is denser, when you pull this off it feels like there is a lot of metal here. Which is a very nice change of pace verses everything always being plastic and feeling cheap. This does feel like a significant item when you are holding it. The weight of this, on the scale shows a little less than an ounce, 0.8 ounces for the weight.What we'll do is test the write and read speed on a few file transfers. We'll verify it actually holds a full terabyte and then we can give a final rating. The physical quality of this feels really premium to me.Looks and feels are not everything. While exercising this drive I observed spiky transfer speeds and quickly declining performance. When the drive was empty and fresh, I observed quick data transfers of 170MB/s for several GBs. However, after ratcheting up the data and filling the drive the performance quickly waned and temperatures also raised. The thermal imaging showed the drive running warm at about 116 F in spots. The file transfers to the drive would regularly start at 170 MB/s, then after 50GB or so the speed would settle in at about 50MB/s. However, I did see transfers drop down to 4MB/s. For the price of this drive, I would hope for more consistently high performance. Read speeds were not super impressive either, but I did see a 260GB read settle in and average about ~250MB/s. Again, started stronger at 440, then dropped.I do appreciate the form factor and it is nice to not require a large caddy and USB cable, however for the price differential I think I'll stick with the caddy and cable. Performance is more important to me. Due to the low overall performance of this drive, I can only rate it three out of five stars.Pros- Full 1 TB in size (1,002,590,781,440 bytes, 933GB)- Small form factor- Premium feel- Quick read speeds compared to a normal USB stick drive (~253 MB/s sustained for a ~260GB transfer)Cons- Slows down significantly as it fills up or on large transfers (starts at 170 MB/s, then settles around 50, but sometimes sputters to only 5)- Runs a bit warm- Pricy compared to 2.5 inch SSDs and external carrier",
