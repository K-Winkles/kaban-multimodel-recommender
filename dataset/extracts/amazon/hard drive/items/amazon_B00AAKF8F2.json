                "reviewText": "just got installed and restored ps3 doesn't stutter anymore. should have replaced long time ago. seems a bit noisy compared to other hard drive though, is this bad/ good, normal?UPDATE Aug 17th: Removed stars, the ps3 ran ok, but not even a month later, now I'm not sure, I think the drive is already going bad(or maybe it was never good to begin with). The ps3 was working ok, but is having trouble to complete the restore the file system or rebuild database function, it seems like it just hangs and nothing is happening. It did make a lot of noise during the format/ restore process initially. At time's the data transfer light on the external would stop and the drive would make noise for a really long time, though it may just have to do with ps3 back up utility. Maybe it'd be possible to get a replacement, I think has a 1 year warranty? Not that I want to got through the whole process again, even though it was relatively simple.UPDATE Next day: maybe i spoke too soon, drive is fine, rebooted again in non safe mode and it said hdd was corrupt (prob from playing Defi and freezing up randomly all the time), the restore ran ok and safe mode seemed to work fine after that. So if your ps3 freezes and ever asks to restore the file system, I'd suggest doing that and not skipping out with circle(which I usually did). Seems like maybe thats what caused safe mode to get hung up.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: The drive ran in a laptop for 16 months. The laptop was dropped several times while it was running which can't have been good for the drive. I continued to run that program that thrashed the drive on a daily basis and it worked great. Suddenly, the laptop slowed way down, to the point that it was not useful, so I took it out of service. I don't know what caused the failure, whether it had anything to do with the drive or not, but it ran great in very difficult conditions for 16 months for $25.ORIGINAL POST: I bought this drive because it was super cheap and I needed a cheap drive to put in a computer in an application that is tough on hard drives. The application thrashes the drive continuously all day long. I knew that I was taking a chance but it was so cheap that I decided to give it a try to see what happens. So far it's worked great for three weeks and I bet I have already put it through more stress than many folks will in a year. No problems yet. I'm going to let it keep running and see what happens. I'll update this when it fails and then you all will know how many hours of thrashing these \"Generic\" drives will stand.",

I followed the process of switching out your HDD for your PS3 and placed my 500GB HDD inside the system. The drive worked great and the 4.66 update was installed. once I restored my console I checked my system information and there it was. The amount of free space of GB was updated. Then after that came the tedious task of reinstalling EVERYTHING onto this new HDD. Everything from my flash drive where my game saves were stored, to all my purchases on the PSN store and installing all the game data from my games. Having to do that with gta 5 again was annoying ha. I should also mention the the drive runs smoothly. My PS3 purrs and runs great. What I thought was weird was that in the description it said \"2.5 SATA\" but when I looked at it and read the info on the HDD it said \"3.0 SATA\" but still had the 500 GB. Still it works with my PS3. I had my doubts about this drive at first just because its generic but hey it works fine and I feel so much better knowing that I have ALOT of free space now on my PS3.",

                "reviewText": "I had terribly skipping cutscenes on God of War 3, made it almost unplayable, and audio skipping on quite a few other games (like Metal Gear Solid 4)... really getting annoying. So I went out on a limb and bought this HDD, the cheapest I could find, just thinking it was worth a try. It shows up quickly (less than 1 week shipping), looks brand new, Samsung brand, doesn't indicate it if it's 5400 RPM, but I'll trust it is (I got the 320GB, exactly like I ordered and exactly like I was replacing on the PS3). I went to install it but the Sony firmware on their site (4.88) kept saying \"data corrupted\" when I tried to install it, so I found another backup copy on PSXHax website (look it up if you need to), and that installed perfectly, formatted the new hard drive, etc. Got everything back on my PS3 back up and running, and tried God of War 3 again - works PERFECTLY now! The HDD seems faster than my old one and best of all no more problems with skipping etc. I assume they're just selling excess stock here or something, but I'm thrilled to have the good quality at excellent price to fix my PS3 issue. Thank a lot!",

                "reviewText": "At first I was skeptical because I saw the word \"Generic\" thinking it was not going to be a good quality hard drive but the seller had the description \"Will send Western Digital or Seagate drive\". I thought about it and I took a chance and bought one and recieved a good quality Seagate hard drive at a great price. Well, considering how high the ratings are you might as well purchase one if you are in need of more space. I bought a 500GB HDD to replace the factory 80GB I've been using ever since I bought my PS3. The hard drive works great and now I can install all my games and DLC content onto my PS3 as well as all the anime and movies I've downloaded too. Replacing the drive is very easy but waiting for games to re-install/update is the hard thing to do. After swapping drives, it showed 412GB / 465GB. Now I'm glad I can finally play GT6 and GTA V since the install of those games takes up a lot of space.",

So far the drive works well but these companies should come clean whether these are new or old stock or used drives. I'd eat a \"used\" drive for the right price and warranties if they just said so. They ought be more trusting of buyers too.",
