It doesn\u2019t have the greatest speed but I feel comfortable carrying it around more than other hard disk drives. The only drawback is the size and bulk so I have bought a Samsung drive that is smaller and lighter but if I\u2019m choosing one to venture into the mountains with I\u2019d take the Lacie for sure.",
