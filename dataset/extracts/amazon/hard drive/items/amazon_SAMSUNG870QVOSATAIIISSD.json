                "reviewText": "At nearly $600, the 8 TB Samsung 870 QVO SATA III SSD will put a hit on your wallet, but you have to expect to pay for this kind of speed. Installation was simple, the drive was little more than plug and play in the 2.5\" drive bay on my Dell XPS 8940. But the again, I had two spare drive bays and data and power cables. Of curse your results may differ.This drive was a replacement for a secondary (data storage) 4 TB HDD that was coming very close to reaching capacity. Samsung provides a link to download their Magician software, ostensibly to aid in data migration. However, the software will only clone a drive with the operating system installed. So much for that.My first attempt at cloning was to connect the new drive to my computer via USB 3 cable and copying all of the contents before cracking open the computer and installing the new drive. If figured I would just copy the files over using Windows. Big mistake. There were errors and the process went on for two days and might have only reached 50%. I bought some cloning software and the process was still very slow. I got frustrated and then just decided to install the drive and follow the cloning process, however long it would take. Installing the drive and using the SATA interface made the process incredibly fast and the whole process (3.6 TB of data) was completed in about eight hours.I like that when I'm working, the only sound I hear from my computer is the ventilation fan and not the chirping of a hard disk drive.",

                "reviewText": "I take a lot of photos and videos, so I need a lot of storage space. This SSD provides a huge amount of storage with very good performance. It will slow down if you copy a huge amount of data to it all at once, but in ordinary use you won't see any slowdown.Installation was easy, and my Dell XPS 8950 with Windows 11 recognized it without any problems. I just needed to partition and format the drive and it was ready for use. It's not as fast as an NVMe SSD, but the cost per byte is much better. It's much faster than a hard drive, although a bit more expensive. I used a SABRENT mounting bracket to mount the drive in a 3.5in drive bay.",

                "reviewText": "The product arrived earlier than expected and required a 1 time code on delivery which ensured it would not be stolen. The product arrived in a well secured box and was fitted snugly to prevent damage in transit. Upon initial connection internally, my computer was not able to detect the drive for setup. I tried to connect it externally and also was unable to successfully get the drive to be detected. After a call to amazon where it was determined a replacement was not possible (My only grievance). I took the drive to a repair center where I found out the drive was perfectly fine, both the cords I used were faulty. After using a different cord I got the drive to be recognized and set it up fully. So far the drive has been working perfectly with fast transfer and load speeds.TLDR: The drive is fantastic and works perfectly as expected. Make sure you check your cables and ensure everything is working on your end before blaming the drive right away.",

                "reviewText": "Great response times as a media drive in my HTPC. No more pausing of Windows Explorer while the system indexes the available folders (movies). Smooth playback of videos (DVD and 4K content). Installation was simple. I had extra power connections and SATA cables in my tower, so no issues there. It does not include cables, but the description said that. And I don't know any mfr still including cables with SSD purchases, so not unexpected.Caught it on Prime Day, so it was getting more reasonable in price, but still pricey. But spacious, quiet, low power draw, and FAST.Way better than getting a 7200k or 10k regular hard-drive, waaaay quieter than any of the high capacity SATA spinning drives.Soooo much more responsive than the spinning drives.I'd like to buy 3 more for other PC's and media-centers, but the price needs to come down a little more.I've had great luck with Samsung SSD's, so hopefully this one lasts also, but I'll keep a back-up of my content just in case.",
