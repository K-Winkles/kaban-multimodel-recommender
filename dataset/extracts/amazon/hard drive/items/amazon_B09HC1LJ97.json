                "reviewText": "Avoid purchasing at all costs is what I wish the headlines said. It really pays to read the reviews before purchasing items. I had the same experiences as other 1 star reviewers. I took it out of the box, and plugged it into my surface 8, didn't work. Plugged it into my windows computer, it said it had to be formatted but was unable to format. Plugged it into iMac, but the iMac could not read/mount it, plugged it into my Linux, Linux of all things could not find the drive to read it. Sent it back to the sellers, they replaced the item with one that was discoverable on all drives. I quickly went about saving my 350GB worth of data from one bulky external flash to this portable sleek number thinking I was being progressive. Then when I opened the thumb drive, all the flies I had copied were no longer visible. The folders were empty. Was really hoping to finally have a drive that I could easily use with my surface without extra peripherals but alas this was wasted potential. Waste of time. Wasted effort. Just a General WASTE! Its utter trash. Oh and bonus, I lost all my files that were copied/back-up to this drive. They virtually disappeared after just saving to the device within a 24 hours period. All 350GB of data gone.",

                "reviewText": "This is the 2nd 1TB Memory Stick I purchased which failed. It was kind of cool because it had both a standard USB plug, and the smaller USB-C end. This device initially held and played up to three dozen of the family videos I had made in the last 20 years on my 2 DVD players just fine. But as I added more videos to the memory stick (76 GB), the stick failed, becoming unreadable in the DVD players' memory stick device.(The videos were in MP4 format and ranged in size from 2 minutes long at 90MB, up to 13 minutes long at 2.2 GB.)The two different DVD players I own, which work great and play my other video memory sticks just fine, gave this error message: \"USB device (front) unknown. The USB device connected to this unit's front panel is not supported.\"The total size of the videos I added to the 1 TB memory stick was 76GB. It should easily hold and play up to 10 times the amount of what was on the stick and still have plenty of headroom!!! This \"Memory Stick 1TB, SXINDE High-Speed USB Flash Drive\" is a FAILURE!Unfortunately, the extremely short Amazon Prime return window \u2013 30 days \u2013 was past so I was stuck with a 1 TB USB stick that could only work with about 50 GB on it. What a scam!P.S. \u2013 I purchased a different 1TB memory stick at the same time, and it also failed. See my separate review of that stick.",
