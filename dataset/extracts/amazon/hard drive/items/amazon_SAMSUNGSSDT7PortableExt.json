                "reviewText": "I now own several generations (and 3 colors!) of Samsung T SSDs- T3, T5, T7 plus the Shield version.They've been my long-time go-to, especially as prices come down and file sizes go up.Thin-sliced from my 1st review: It's an easy-to-use and very secure little device, fast and simple to use across devices and even systems, as plugging in it opens a choice of OS and a window to log-in. The password is always what you assign at set-up, and it's hard-wired into the device, so it stays secure, requiring password every time it's first connected.Tech specs you can read. It's fast, blazing when connected to other SSD's. Gets a little toasty with huge transfers (like my 1GB initial transfer from another drive). It comes with two types of USB cables, which work well, and secure it well even if pulled around a bit on its short length. I'd note that the T7 Shield is an exception, consistently coming (in my experience) with a poorly designed connector/receptacle, nearly impossible to keep a solid connection unless you don't breathe or vibrate things when you type. That bad.I digress. This - the basic T7 (newer software interface but basically same as T5 - is one of those things that \"just works\". Like the others, on the Mac it may hava some small quirks - like saying it's disconnected when you first connect, or similar, but it works fine, 100% of the time for me thus far, all of them (knock on wood). Unless you really truly like the idea of the ridged design and heat-dissipation of the Shield, I'd advise against it (I called Samsung, they said they'd send a new cord, and didn't, and claim not to know about the port/plug issue). That off my chest, I love and swear by the T5s and T7s, and caveat emptor on the Shields.",
