I have gotten it to download some of my pictures off my phone, but I have used up the battery in my phone, 3 times, and still am not even half way through. Can't figure out how to identify files, so I may be downloading the same thing over and over? And product support, that just tells you how to send it back, which I may have to do.",

The storage drive was easy to connect to the phone directly and then also can be connected to the pc. Transferring pictures from iPhone to pc is the worst so this made it sooo much easier! Would definitely recommend over other storages due to the cables that come connected already and also how easy is to transfer data from phone to storage! Adding to the review this thing works so well I got a second one. Tip is to make sure to charge it lol always happens to me when I try to use it and it\u2019s not working.",
