I am giving it 5 stars because it does everything I need it to do.Here are some considerations for future purchasers,The usb cord for this hard-drive isn't very long so that's something to keep in mind if you need to string the usb cord behind tv.Speed - I bought this because of the price and large storage. However from my research done before buying, if Speed is important consideration for you then you might want to look at other options.The speed of the device isn't what I would consider lightning fast but it's not slow either. It's just right for what I need - a good all round product that does most things well.",

I\u2019m not in love with the USB 3.0 connector but it is advertised in the product listing. I haven\u2019t noticed an issue with heat, although I am not using it for anything intense. It isn\u2019t too noisy. A great external drive for backup purposes. Four stars because the included software is low-quality (in my opinion) and the provided link didn\u2019t work for me out of the box - had to search around online to try it out.",
