For everyone who has left negative reviews anywhere because the external hard drive you got didn't have the storage as advertised, please google how storage space is measured. Some space is always lost due to formatting data necessary for the drive. I really hate seeing reviews that complained that the available space was less than whatever was listed like it was due to some shady practice. This drive, formatted as is, was plug and play with has 698GB of storage. I'm thrilled! And I have experience with tech. My very first hard drive was an external drive from Radio Shack and it was a whopping 10 Megs, yes megabytes, and I felt like hot stuff for getting it! My computer only came with two floppy drives. Yes, I've been around a while. I have no problem recommending the Caraele drive to anyone. Within seconds of plugging it in, I could copy files to it. Whoo Hooo. Only one caution, the box it came in said it was a case only and I thought I got the wrong thing but when I opened it, the drive was there just as pictured on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this storage expansion device for my Xbox S since unfortunately the S comes with very little storage. It was working well for a while, but after about 6 months of use, my games that were on it began to freeze up or not open at all, not to mention it glitches whenever I try to download new games on it despite me having 50% storage available and the games being small enough in size. The blue light is now blinking on it, too and they don\u2019t list any information about that on their product page nor will Amazon help me. I really hope I can get a replacement or a refund under warranty as I paid $40 after tax for this and it should not stop working like this for that much money.",

I can no longer retrieve the files from it, and now it sits in my closet as a beacon of hate every time I see it. I should throw it away but I hold on to useless hope that one day i will plug it up and it will work just fine. Let me have my dreams please.And just don't drop it.",
