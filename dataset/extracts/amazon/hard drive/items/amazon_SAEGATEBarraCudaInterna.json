I kept it on my self for months waiting until I had enough cameras on my NVR to actually need the extra storage. I put it in my NVR a few weeks ago. It came up loaded the latest OS image and started working. A few days later I got an alert from the NVR that the harderive was bad. A week later the NVR went offline. Finally had time to go out and check on it this evening. Putting the original drive back in the NVR brought it back online. I took this drive and put it in my Windows PC to reformat. It shows as uninitialized and wouldn't initialize with GPT or MBR throwing IO errors. It appears to be a total failure. I checked Seagate website and these remans are given warranty through Seagate, only by their merchant. Since I'm out of the return window I don't think there is much I can do.",

The mounting bracket also adds bulk so it cannot be used in the final installation.Had to add some insulation to the exposed PCB side as that will rest directly on metalI removed the bottom cover of the PS4 pro and the rear metal shield.Then i connected the drive directly on SATA connectorFinally i replaced the rear metal shield. I did not screw the screws all the way down as the shield was bending around the hard drive. This also created some force to hold the drive in place as it would not have this benefit without the bracket.Now i have 1.5TB free space left after installing my whole library of PS4 games.",

I had one drive fail on me under a year, but the vendor was nice enough to replace it (In fact, that is the reason why I am giving them a review as high as I am).Normally I don't really have too many issues with hard drives, even refurbs I would use just for some throwaway space in my server, but these drives have been an issue. I had one completely fail on me in less than a year and now my other one starting to fail in about a year and a half since purchase.I would recommend going spend a little more money and getting a new drive over this because I, as well as others, have not been having a good experience with these drives. My plan was maybe to get 3-5 years, was hoping more towards 5 years, but I am not even getting 2 years out of these drives.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted the largest 2.5\" drive I could get/afford to put into a Tivo Bolt+ DVR. I decided to take a chance on this refurbished drive as it is less expensive than a new one.The drive arrived in excellent packaging and looks to be new. I installed it in the Tivo Bolt+ DVR and it works as expected. I now have 790+ hours of HD recording space.Note that this is a 15mm high drive which is higher than most laptop drives, although 15mm is one of the accepted standard heights for 2.5\" drives. Just make sure that your device will take a drive of this height. It fits in the Tivo Bolt+ fine. I also put one of these into my MSI GT72S MQE laptop, and technically a 15mm drive doesn't fit; I was able to install it bot the bottom cover of the laptop does not close securely where the hard driver is located (there is a bulge in the plastic). It is workable, but technically not correct.If you need a large capacity 2.5\" drive, this 5TB model is a good value at the refurbished price, as long as you can deal with the 15mm height.",
