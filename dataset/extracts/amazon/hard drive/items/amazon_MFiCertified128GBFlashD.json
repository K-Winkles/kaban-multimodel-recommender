In case the iphone storage flash drive is not recognized by your phone, uninstall the \"BLANBOK+\" app, restart your phone, and manually download the app again from the App Store. 2.If you have previously backed up files on iCloud, you will need to download the files to your phone or iPad from iCloud and then copy them to the USB flash drive. 3.The usb storage flash drive is only compatible for Android phones that have the OTG function. You can find the external USB storage in the \"File Manager\" app on your phone. If your phone doesn't work, you need to open the phone settings to enable the OTG connection. Please Note: 1.Media files downloaded from iTunes or other third-party applications cannot be transferred or viewed due to digital rights management protection. 2.For small-capacity lightning flash drives that have better compatibility, the preferred format is FAT32. For large-capacity USB flash drives, it is recommended to use exFAT format. If the photo storage device is unable to transfer files, you can convert the format from FAT32 to exFAT by formatting. However, remember to save the files before formatting to prevent data loss. 3.After using the photo stick, ensure that you turn off any apps related to the iphone thumb drive and gently unplug the usb jump drive to prevent any damage to the files stored on it.",

I figured this device out without instructions in roughly ten minutes. Plug it into your phone of iPad and figure it out. Alternatively, you could read the instructions, I guess.I bought two Sandisk disk drives, downloaded all my pictures and videos from my phone onto this little drive, plugged the new drive into my Mac and transferred all of those 1700+ pictures and videos onto the Sandisk drives and I'm all set. I love it! I'm very glad I bought it.",

The external storage function gives statistics and allows adding files from albums in internal storage.The internal storage function of the App gives statistics, but does not allow access to files in internal storage.Physically the USB is well constructed, but the lighting connection has a bulky shoulder that prevents inserting with any protective covers installed. The USB drive well as a USB A drive, but the App makes the other two ports limited in use.There is a reason the BlanBok+ App has a very poor rating and equally poor reviews in the App Store!",

Perfect!It causes my phone to get a little warm sometimes. I also have a wireless charger so I can plug this into my phone and the pop my phone on the wireless charger and let it suck up my pictures overnight.I have nearly 20,000 pictures and using this flash drive will allow me to not have to pay Apple monthly for storage. I'll just back them all up to my hard drive and my computer and be done with the subscription fee!I raved about this so much that my friend asked me to purchase one for her. They have been amazing!",
