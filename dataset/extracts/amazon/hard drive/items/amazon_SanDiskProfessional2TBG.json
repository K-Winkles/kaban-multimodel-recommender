                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Very disappointed",
                "reviewText": "After a mere two months of sporadic use, I encountered severe issues with my hard drive, which have left me incredibly frustrated. Specifically, the device is no longer being recognized consistently, despite my best efforts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem. This is an especially significant issue for me, as I had a substantial amount of content stored on the device that I feared was irretrievable. However, thanks to my knowledge of data recovery methods and a resourceful online community, I was able to restore the lost content and transfer it to a more reliable drive.I also attempted to perform a complete erase of all data on the device to restart it and potentially resolve the recognition issue. While the erase seemed to be successful at first, it was short-lived, and the device quickly returned to its original state of not being recognized. This has been a disappointing experience for me, especially given that I had opted to invest in a higher-end hard drive, believing that it would be a more dependable and long-lasting choice.It's worth noting that hard drives are essential components of any computer system, used to store all manner of important data, ranging from personal documents to business records. As such, it's crucial to choose a hard drive that can provide the reliability and durability necessary to safeguard your information. In particular, it's essential to consider the type of hard drive you're purchasing, as well as its capacity, transfer speed, and overall performance.For example, one key factor to consider when selecting a hard drive is its type, with the two primary options being solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs are known for being faster, more durable, and less susceptible to damage from physical impacts, making them an excellent choice for users who need high-speed data access or are frequently on the move. On the other hand, HDDs typically offer higher storage capacities at a more affordable price point, making them a more practical choice for users who require vast amounts of storage space for their data.In conclusion, my experience with my recent hard drive purchase highlights the importance of carefully considering the features and specifications of any storage device you're considering. While a higher-end device may promise superior performance, it's crucial to evaluate its reliability and durability, and weigh these factors against the cost to determine the best value for your needs.",

It's a mechanical drive, and almost certainly a 5400RPM drive at that (although I can't seem to find confirmation of that on the product page), so the speed is not going to be super blazing fast, but if you're just using it as a backup drive, then the speed isn't terribly important, certainly not as important as capacity. Seems very sturdy and well-built, though of course I haven't tested the durability by deliberately dropping or throwing it. It feels like it could handle being jostled around a bit in your laptop bag though. Overall good purchase for keeping your stuff backed up.",
