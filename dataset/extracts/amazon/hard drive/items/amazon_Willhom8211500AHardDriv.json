Plan was to replace the HDD, but when we opened up his machine, it turned out to be in the \"upper\" bay, aka the one that's quite difficult to access. After ordering this kit, we were able to put the SSD in the \"lower\" bay (the one accessible without removing the motherboard) giving him both drives operable!",

                "reviewText": "Before making this purchase, please the negative reviews by searching for your YEAR Mac to see what people report.Seller claims: \"In the 2011 or 2012 models, this cable is used to add a 2nd internal hard drive.\" NOPEWell, the cable I received is 100% IDENTICAL TO THE PRIMARY drive cable I already had inside my 2012. I see this problem happened to other 2012 reviewers. You can't perform a 2 drive install using two primary cables - one won't reach because both cables are intended to be unequal lengths.I think their supplier is mixing up the cables when making a kit, or their 2012 model notes are wrong, or maybe there's some variation on Apple's part. The problem is not \"skill\" the seller says you need (I can hand solder 0402 and have reassembled iphones).Just pay more for the ifixit kit, but you'll get back free time, and they have a great community and deserve the support. If you order the Willhom 821-1500-A anyways, install it right away don't sit on it until return window closes.Aside from the kit being wrong cable, all the necessary parts look decent. Kit has the torx you need, logic bar puller, grommets, and the PCB cable looks to be same quality as the original.",
