                "reviewText": "I ordered this PS5 M.2 SSD Expansion Slot cover as I had an M.2 SSD with a \u201cQIVYNSRY M.2 Heatsink NVMe 2280 PS5 SSD\u201d already installed and thought the original closed design of the provided cover was less than ideal for airflow and heat dissipation. This new heatsink has a removable and porous grill, which you can clean, allowing air to move more easily between the SSD and the circulating air of the PS5. The actual construction of the cover looks to be quality and fits my SSD heatsink.\ufffcThe box includes an extra M.2 standoff spacer, screws, a Phillips screwdriver, and one thermal pad. Adding standoff spacers, screws, and a screwdriver is a nice touch if you don\u2019t have the requisite tools or hardware, but including a thermal pad baffles me. A thermal pad on its own is not a thing. You need a surface to dissipate the heat. Even the video on the order page shows someone installing the thermal pad on their SSD and calling it a day. Don\u2019t do this. Use a heatsink. They cost about $10 and will significantly prolong the life of the SSD chips and memory.Having an extra thermal pad is a good thing, but it is not in and of itself a cooling solution. In any case, this is a quality vented PS5 M.2 SSD cover. It improves on the original SSD cover and is cheap enough to add to a basic heatsink purchase for $20. I recommend it if you believe your SSD is throttling performance because of temperatures or want to squeeze out every last drop of your M.2 SSD performance.",

Hopefully, the extra air flow will help cool my new drive. Working great, so far. An easy extra bit of insurance, and only takes the same amount of time as replacing your original drive cover.",

                "reviewText": "This metal cover came with everything needed to replace the factory cover. The finish is shined but not mirrored. I would say it has better cooling properties than the stock cover since it is solid and this one is vented. It even came with a thermal tape to transfer heat from the ssd to the cover so in a way it acts like a second heat sink of sorts. It took longer to get the side panel of the console off than it did for swapping this ssd cover.",
