Emailed and processed a quick warranty replacement, down side is you have to pay for send it back, but turnaround time was less than a week, very quick, great service. For QNAP owners, when I had them tested in QNAP, it was unacceptable loud even when idle. Then I found out if you mount these drives with screws instead of using just quick snap mounts, they make much less noise because less vibration between drives and trays. For Synology there is no way to mount with screws(at lease my DS1621+), but somehow Synology managed to have less vibration using just quick snap mounts, no problem so far, other than full load, 5 drives are very quiet.",

I did a full dd wipe before mounting, and no errors or bad sectors. However, I found it odd that in smartmontools, the drive doesn't report '187 - Reported Uncorrectable' or '188 - Command Timeout' stats, which are 2 of the 5 attributes I monitor (per Backblaze) to indicate pending failure.At half the price, I could replace these twice as often as the IronWolf's and still come out even. But without the stats, I feel like I'm half in-the-dark about drive health. So... still undecided.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased 8 of these drives at various times and at various prices in last 3 years and have yet to see a failure (surprisingly). 4 of them are in my NAS system running 24/7. The other 4 I keep on hand for spares or migrations/expansions. To be honest, I was expecting more problems when I purchased them or for them to be discontinued (hence the extra's) but ya, they're great... and still sold 3 years later... so the honest truth is these are awesome drives at rock bottom prices and I fully plan on purchasing more. This is the best kept secret. I didn't want to leave this review because I wanted to keep it that way but its the right thing to do so you're welcome.More details:- As far as I can tell, they are new drives, not renewed. They all came packaged well and unopened.- They get the expected 170 MBps seq read/write for a 7200 RPM drive.- They do get toasty if left unchecked, however I run them in a well ventilated enclosure in a cold basement so I don't have any thermal issues.- Despite having a White-Label, doing a deeper dive shows that all the drives I got are actually HGST. Some of them literally have HGST model number in the stats (see bottom one in the screenshot), but the firmware running on the others leads me to believe that they are also HGST/Western Digital. Because these are White-Label tho, nothing is certain.- A few of the drives are only rated at SATA II despite saying SATA III on the page. Really tho - that doesnt matter. A hard disk can never SATA III speeds anyways. Just an oddity I noticed.",

So let me tell ya, these drives are the LOUDEST hard drives on planet earth. I could place them in a welding shop and still hear them clunking away in the background. That's how loud they are. Do not put these in a bed room unless you can sleep through a marching band. Also the vibration is crazy when it's finding data. No idea how long they'll last but if the sound is any gauge, not even a year.Might remember to update the review when they fail. If they last 2 years I'll consider myself lucky.",
