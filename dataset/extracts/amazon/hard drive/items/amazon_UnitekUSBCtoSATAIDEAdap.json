A business card was included with the product which had a QR code on it to scan to take you to the manual page. However it takes you to the manufacturer\u2019s products page for their manuals so you have to pick the correct product (which isn\u2019t shown), or you have to search by the model # which they note is on the outside of the box. However what should be the model # as found on the item (AR-xxxx) and is found on the box is not any of their product model #\u2019s! Finally I found the product # (in small print) under the QR code. So great I\u2019m good to go, but no Y-3322D is not a valid model #! Now if you want the manual for Y-3322, or for Y-3322 \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d great you are in luck; if you want the manual for Y-3322D to bad you\u2019re out of luck.Pro:1. Taking a leap of faith that I was connecting the 4 prong power supply from the product to my old hard drive correctly and didn\u2019t have it reversed, then EUREKA the old hard drive came to life and neither it nor the product blew up or started smoking.2. Great product and it does exactly what I bought it for.For those of us literate enough to use a computer or laptop, but illiterate and not tech savvy to computer hard drives it\u2019d be beneficial to actually have a printed (and detailed) manual either with this product or one that is correctly linked to the product item page on Amazon, or at the very least for the manufacturer to provide an online manual for this product.If you\u2019re comfortable pulling out a computer hard drive to retrieve old files and pictures instead of paying someone else to do it for you, then the Pro\u2019s heavily outweigh the Con\u2019s and I recommend this SATA IDE Adapter.",

                "reviewText": "This device worked straight out of the box. I connected three old HDDs that I'd saved with the vague hope that one day I'd be able to access the photos on them. Uncovered photos of my wife and kids from my first digital camera (a Kodak 2M camera that took a great shot...) and even some of the earlier photos that I'd captured using my then current mobile phone. Some of the phone photos are tiny, as you'd expect, but the others are now stored safely in all their glory.I happily recommend this product - great value, no effort, no complicated instructions, just plug it all in and enjoy searching through old photos and files.",

However, this one is not only cheaper, but does a great job.",
