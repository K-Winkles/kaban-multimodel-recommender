                "reviewText": "Was happy to find a kit that had two larger containers for shampoo and conditioner, which I use the most, and smaller ones for just the right amount of other things. Plus really appreciated the two spray bottles, smaller than the usual travel bottles and perfect for hair spray or body mist. So far the small tubs are proving leakproof, at least for the foundation and hand cream I put in them. The tiny spoons and brush nice touches for filling/emptying and cleaning. Also love how soft the containers are, very easy to squeeze contents out.",

The stickers they provided were useful for labeling my shampoo, conditioner, etc. I also liked the design of the bottles and the variety of shapes/types and sizes\u2014 for example, I put leave in conditioner in the spray bottle and face lotion in the smaller round containers. The clear bag was also nice to see everything that I had packed. Very solid and reliable product!",

Ok for creamy stuff, but not liquids. Had my liquid nitrogena and it kept leaking out during my travel making everything in the pouch a mess, no matter how much I tighten it up.Otherwise, the bigger ones contained more than I expected. Was away for over a week and came back with some bottles still half full.",

I did use shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and facial cleanser. And in the small little pill boxes I put eye serum, face moisturizer and foundation make-up. In the spray bottle I put some Burke Williams essential oil shower spray so we can enjoy it on our trip. So glad these didn\u2019t leak. And very thankful for the little spatulas and the cleaning brush and labels!",
