But that must just be par for the course with these items. I do like that it has a percentage number on the battery. To show you how much is left before it needs charging. It charges best when it's plugged into a wall outlet. I don't recommend charging it in a car as it doesn't charge that well.",

Unfortunately when I traveled with it I used a different card and it didn't charge my phone. This was really disappointing. So I would just be careful with the charger that you use. I went back to use the old charger and it's been working fine since.",
