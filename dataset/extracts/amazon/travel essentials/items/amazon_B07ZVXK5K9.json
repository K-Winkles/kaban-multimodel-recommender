I had to!So I\u2019m not the best at keeping up with skin care, but I think that\u2019s because previous lines don\u2019t show immediate results on my skin or they\u2019re too expensive to try.Immediately you\u2019re going to feel the difference in texture. I didn\u2019t realize how rough my face was until I started using this. So that\u2019s great! Since this is just a hydration line, I\u2019d recommend pairing it with an exfoliant once a week. I have two concerns with any new skin care product: 1. Will this make me break out? And 2. Will my skin be gross and flakey if I stop using this everyday? I\u2019ve had these products for two months and they haven\u2019t made me break out and I LOVE that if I skip a few days, my skin never dries up. Even though this is a small travel kit, there\u2019s more than enough product, I haven\u2019t ran out yet.For the eye cream, I literally touch the product and it\u2019s enough for both eyes. Same with the night cream, I\u2019ll dip in for not even a small blob of product and my whole face and neck are moisturized.I say it\u2019s worth the try! It\u2019s not expensive either so it makes the jump to try much easier",

I don\u2019t know if my skin has been so soft and healthy feeling maybe ever. So far no break outs or irritation. I\u2019ve even purchased the moisturizer with sunscreen full size, and I plan on getting the face wash full size. I haven\u2019t traveled with the kit but I think the products would be fine. My only annoyance is that they don\u2019t make the prep and balm stick in full size anywhere. It is an odd product, and at first I was wondering what kind of witchcraft it was. It works well and feels great on, and I finished it first out of everything in the kit. I don\u2019t want to buy a new kit every time I run out of the stick because the moisturizer, eye cream, and night moisturizer are all going to last several more weeks. ELF please make the balm stick in full size ?! I think it\u2019s worth the money to try it, I usually don\u2019t end up liking everything in a line, but this one I do.",
