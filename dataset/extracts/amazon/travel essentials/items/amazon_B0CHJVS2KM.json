                "reviewText": "Very pleased with this travel bottle cleaning kit. My little one still drinks milk from a bottle so it was nice to have this kit to carry around. If I were still a pumping mom, I would\u2019ve appreciated this too! It has all the brush heads you need: the large brush head for bottles, the tapered brush for bottle nipples, and a straw cleaner.Other travel kits will only have the brushes and no drying rack, but love how this has a fold out stand to dry the bottles. I also appreciate the included soap bottle. Folds compact which I can easily just throw in a diaper bag, and when I need it, it doesn\u2019t take much space on a countertop near a sink.The other important feature about this kit is that the brush heads are silicone which is perfect because it doesn\u2019t hold onto moisture or breed bacteria like regulars brushes.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a compact bottle cleaning set to use when we stay in hotels with baby since hotel bathrooms are the last place I want to clean and dry my bottles is in a hotel sink.This kit has all the tools you need and I love there is a little bottle to put your soap in too. A lot of the kits I saw only had a straw scrubber and then a bottle brush, but I love how this one has those things plus a nipple specific scrubber too! The whole thing packs up nicely and the case fits perfectly into our travel bags.",

                "reviewText": "I took this when we went on vacation and as most parents know, you can't REALLY clean bottled while out and about. This travel kit made life so easy. We were able to clean the different parts of our sons bottle while in a hotel room. The drying rack was incredibly useful! The hotel bathroom was really small so we didn't have room to set things out to dry but this kit made it easy to leave everything drying on the dresser or Nightstand without making a mess. I do think the silicone bristles work better for the residue from breast milk or formula, so if you bottle feed with those you'll love it! The bristles aren't strong or sturdy enough for hard scrubbing but work great for the residue. I really liked the small pump for soap. Very handy!",
