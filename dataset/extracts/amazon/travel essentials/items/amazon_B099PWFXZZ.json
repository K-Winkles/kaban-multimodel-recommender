It proved successful for the majority of our trip, but unfortunately I can\u2019t call it perfectly leak proof. It has a small pump lock to help the pumps not get pushed down in the event that the lid is not on, but unfortunately with consistent or frequent altitude changes, the liquids find there way out anyway. I still love this thing and use it Every time I travel, the only downside is that it leaks into my bag almost every time. Now I just put it in its own baggie to make sure that if/when it leaks, it doesn\u2019t get on anything else and rinse it off in the shower after making it to the destination.",

                "reviewText": "This product is just okay. It\u2019s compact which is nice, but it\u2019s definitely not leak proof. I\u2019d recommend putting it in a plastic bag while packing. I liked the mini pump bottles but I wish it had 4 of those instead of 2 spray bottles. The bottom base is silicone which is hard to put the bottles in, requires some effort. This is good for weekend trips but the bottles are too small for anything long term. All in all, it\u2019s an okay product but I think you\u2019re probably better off just getting mini bottles of your favorite products.",

Easy to fill up and very leak proof (I did keep the pump lock (clip on neck of the pumps) on them when traveling. I bought two sets and even though they wouldn't fit in the same carry on bag, were still of the size that I could have taken them out of the storage containers easily if necessary and put them in one Ziploc bag.The sprays were great and work as should. I have 4 spray bottles and 4 pumps, none of the pumps work. All of the products I used have very different viscosities to them, so it is not that the product is too thick.Sad they don't work as these are perfect in idea!",

I put my toner in the spray bottle and that ish leaked aaalllll out of the bottle, leaving me with no toner for my trip. Genuinely, the pump bottles are decent and don't leak. I think it's a good product, you just have to put pretty viscous liquids in each bottle so it won't leak.",
