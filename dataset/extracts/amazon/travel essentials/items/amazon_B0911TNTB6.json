                "reviewText": "So, I bought these to take with me to Mexico... What I found was that the chews themselves work great- if I had any sort of tummy upset, these took care of it quickly. However, I think the heat I was in made them very soft and sticky, which made them very frustrating to get the wrapper off - the wrapper would stick to the chew, it was so annoying. Now that I'm back home in cooler temps, it's not so bad, but I still have to be careful taking off the wrapper, and usually have to pick off a couple pieces of paper off the chew itself. I won't buy these again, I'll stick to chewable Tums.",
