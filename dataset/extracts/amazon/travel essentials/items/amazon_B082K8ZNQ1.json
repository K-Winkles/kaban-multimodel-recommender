                "reviewText": "I wrote a 5-star review yesterday after receiving this neck pillow. It hasn't posted yet, but I'm going to amend my review after wearing this neck pillow yesterday. First, I'll just say that I wish I could give it more than 5-stars. This neck pillow is more of a neck brace and for someone like me who has arthritis in the neck, it's more than just a pillow to use for a long plane flight. I bought it for an upcoming 10-hour flight from NY to Athens, Greece. I had purchased another neck pillow from Amazon and returned it, it didn't give great support, was bulky and the covering over it was too 'fuzzy' and made me hot. I returned that one. This has a cover that's smooth and comfortable and zips off for washing. Very practical.Just look at the design and how the sides are upright, not rounded like most common neck pillows. It makes sense that if the sides are vertical, it will keep your head vertical and not leaning to one side or forwards. I bought the model with the slide-clip front in front, rather than the model with two strings that tie. The strap is stretchy and each side easily clips together. The strap can be adjusted for length. I prefer it snug, the two sides almost touch when closed, but that's a personal preference. The memory foam is firm enough to keep your head upright, but soft enough to be very comfortable and easy enough to roll up tight and put it in the little drawstring pouch it came with. The eye shades and ear plugs are a nice extra bonus, but the star is the pillow itself. I have hardly taken it off since I got it. The pain in my neck just instantly dissolved.I'm on my laptop a lot, which adds to my neck strain. Wearing this neck 'pillow' which is more of a comfortable neck brace, just totally removes any neck pain or strain. I always do my 'due diligence' before purchasing anything on Amazon, the reviews are helpful. I hope my review helps someone decide to buy this neck pillow. It's just the best find I've had on Amazon this year. I'm grateful to the designer and manufacturer for putting out a quality product that's portable, comfortable, economical and actually does what it's meant to do.",

                "reviewText": "I had a couple of these over the years that felt nice but just didn't have substance to them. This pillow feels like dense memory foam that soft and slowly compresses and cradles your head softly but securely. Other pillows have always sunk instead of supporting the head and leave you with a kink in your neck. Having this before flying 27k+ miles in less than a week was a lifesaver, especially doing a 17.5hr flight starting it off. This allowed me to rest comfortably watching movies as well as actually sleep comfortably. The smell some complain about are either old reviews or extremely sensitive people and I'll explain why. Upon receiving the pillow it was in a vented bag instead of a box which even included instructions along with an explanation that they switched packaging to let the product air out. It had a mild chemical smell to it but not strong like vehicle floor liners I've got off here for example. Simply leaving it out for a couple days aired it out and it was ready to go. The eye mask was handy when the plane was lit and I used my own ear plugs with noise canceling instead of the foam ones provided. Washing the cover after the trip and putting it back on was simple.",

                "reviewText": "I have only had a chance to use this a couple of times so far, so we will see how long it holds up, but initially this pillow has much better support than others. Between firm memory foam and well placed drawstrings, this pillow actually allows you to relax, without feeling that you need to exert any energy to keep it in place, or compressing so much that it is like having nothing there at all to support your head.It is also very easy to roll and put back in its travel bag, so it does not take up much space.The true test will be to see how it holds up after multiple users and washing (following the directions) but so far this seems like a good investment.",
