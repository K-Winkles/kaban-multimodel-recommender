Tienen pegamento para unirlo atr\u00e1s con muy buen agarre, pero tambi\u00e9n para pegarlo a la ropa y evitar que se mueva.No creo que sea para uso diario porque al final se genera m\u00e1s basura, pero son excelentes para viajes o alguna salida de emergencia cuando no tengas a la mano los baberos de siempre.",
