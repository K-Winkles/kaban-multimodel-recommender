Has the basics for cuts, scrapes, burns, etc. Bag has enough room to add a few small extra items like packs of antibiotic lotion or extra band-aids. Lightweight and small\u2026 will fit in a fanny pack or cargo pants pocket.",

Ever since we use it here and there, but it\u2019s great to just have on hand and of course to take with you if you\u2019re going somewhere",
