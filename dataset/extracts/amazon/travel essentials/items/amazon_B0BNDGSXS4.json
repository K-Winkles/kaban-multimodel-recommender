                "reviewText": "In August I took a 10 day guided tour of Scotland where we constantly switched hotels. Although I was able to charge my device with my international chargers, in some cases the wall plugs weren't convenient. Especially when I had to charge two cell phones and camera batteries. There were many times I had items charging on either side of the room. So when I came back I set out to look for a compact extension cord type charger. I located several here on Amazon. I love that all styles the cord wrapped around the device and have an included band. I initially purchased 3 different ones before I saw this one for sale promoting fast charging for $20. All four were purchased for $13-$20 each so really reasonably priced. I purchased this one because of the fast charging feature and the slide close to protect the wall plug from particles falling in. Although I have to say I'm not real fond of the 2 wall plugs being in opposite sides. But I love that there is an indicator light so you know immediately that the plug is working and don't have to try and plug in your device. That's a win win for me.The other 3 I purchased all different styles had one thing in common is that the two wall plugs were on the top and USB ports on the side where the cord wrapped around. I haven't returned any of these. I love them all for different reasons and out of the four only two had indicator lights.. bummer.But I have one I will be traveling with domestically in a couple of weeks and one I placed in the suitcase I use for international travel. I hate trying to figure out what Items I use for international travel as apposed to domestic so since I have 2 carry-on suitcases one is designated international and the other domestic.All in all I love this charger and others so much, I have recommended them to friends who cruise alot with family and kids. I know one friend already purchased one. My only wish is I had caught the deal price of $15.99 that's being offered for this now verses the $19.99 I paid a month ago.FYI I purchased the white because it's easier to see in a black lined bag or suitcase.",
