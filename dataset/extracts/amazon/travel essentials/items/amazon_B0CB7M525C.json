I can have a small amount of nutmeg, etc., and use it before it loses potency,These clean very easily, even the covers. They close tightly as well. Big enough for a stash but small enough so that you don't waste spices.

                "reviewText": "I am so excited about these! I've been making wellness shots and storing them in a different container and pouring a shot every day. But these little glasses make it so much easier and save me time. I've been able to fill the glasses up and store them in my fridge. Then I grab them in the morning and can drink them on the spot or take them with me. They have a wide mouth, so they're really easy to fill without a funnel and they're easy to wash. The lids screw on, so the liquid doesn't spill anywhere. Very happy with this purchase!",
