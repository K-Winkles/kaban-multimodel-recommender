                "reviewText": "This is a great product. I want to breakdown the review to go over all the wonderful features of this carry case.I ordered the pink and was not disappointed in the color. Its so pretty. It's a light baby pink color, not too light or dark, a good shade. Makes it easy to find in bag as well as it looks good on a counter. Very pleasant neutral color for a pink shade.It arrived in a manufacturers box, sealed. Product was placed in an inside clear bag to protect it. There were no scratches or imperfections on this case. In the past, venders sent out items not wrapped which were made of the same material and had markings on it. This company took the time and care to properly package their item which I liked. Its very lightweight, super soft, and durableThis is a roomy holder. It's long also which I thought was a plus as I have several brushes and makeup tools that are on the longer side. There is a push button through hold closure which is great as you can adjust the closure width it you have alot of brushes or items inside. If you have a few, then the clasp can fit into a second hole that makes a tighter fit.Inside you can actually put makeup cleaner and scrub your brushes on the go. I have not used it in that capacity, but I have other silicone makeup cleaner pads that have similiar markings to help clean the brushes. This item as alot of markings to use for that, which go up the sides of holder half way. I bet this washes the brushes amazingly. Product dried quickly after initial washing and color stayed true.I can see this item being used for combs, small brushes, even hair scruchies. Its thickness is not chunky which is good, very streamlined for packing. I hope they come out with other products to hold larger items with the same design.I highly recommend this item, and it would make a great gift. I plan on ordering more in different colors to separate my items.",

It comfortably accommodates all my essential makeup brushes, including 4 medium-sized and 3 small ones, with an additional slot for extra brushes. While I haven't tested its brush-cleaning capabilities yet, it appears easy to clean and features textures suitable for the task.",

This case is perfect for me, it holds 3 of my brushes, lip gloss, mascara and a slim perfume container. It has an added bonus of having \"grippers\" on the inside bottom that assist with easy brush cleaning. The button front closure works well and allows the case to become smaller or larger depending on how much stuff you have in it. It is also a plus that the case is made of silicone which is not only flexible but also easy to clean. I love it!",
