                "reviewText": "This works all over the world... used it in Europe, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. Even using it in the USA is great because you can plug it into an outlet then plug in anything you want and you get the advantage of the extra USB ports for charging multiple devices. The price is so great at $15 - 18 which is sometimes the same cost as just a replacement charge plug. The device feels decently light and wont add much to the weight of your carry-on baggage. If you are traveling to countries and not sure what plug they use, definitely just by this and you will be set to go.",

                "reviewText": "I have lived overseas between countries my whole life, so plug adapters are an everyday occurrence for me. This is the best one I have ever come across hands down. It fits every device I have and helps everywhere I spend any time (mainly the Americas, Europe, Africa, and New Zealand). It is one small cube that you can pack pretty much anywhere and comes with very little hassle in plugging in. Just push the button on the side, slide out the plug you want, release the button, and you are good to go. The USB and USB C ports on the bottom are power adapted by the box itself, so if you use those you will have no need of a power adapter, at least for any power range between 110 and 240 volts. It has enough adapters to get you nearly anywhere in the world with ease, the only exceptions being rare and unique plugs from places like Israel, India, and South Africa (which may be scattered elsewhere in which case welcome to world travel). For the more meticulous of you out there - it will accommodate type A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, and N outlets with no functionality for type D (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Namibia) or M (mainly for appliances in South Africa, Swaziland, and Lesotho) and limited functionality for type H (Israel). In general, functionality and portability are fantastic, so much better than having to carry a set of adapters or buying a power strip everywhere you go. You can only plug in one outlet style plug at a time but because of the USB ports that is likely all you will ever need while travelling. The USB ports also charged my phone (a Google Pixel) quite quickly and I had no complaints there. The only thing I would caution before trying (because I haven't been able to personally test it yet) is if the actual outlet plug on it is power converted. Wouldn't want you to cook something because of an assumption that it's adapted. Not saying it doesn't do that, I just haven't checked, so don't try it with something valuable unless someone else already has. :) I take it everywhere, I recommended it to my sister, who bought it, and I recommend it to you. Great adapter",
