                "reviewText": "This converter/adapter did not step down 220 to 110 (yes, the switch was flipped). The handle on the curling iron warmed & started to melt almost immediately in Paris (Europe), and then again in London (UK). It works fine for charging devices (USB) but NOT for actually stepping down 220 to 110. Many hotel rooms have at least 1 USB port, so you don't need it for that unless you need multiple USBs for charging multiple devices. We had another converter/adapter that worked perfectly which leads me to think you have to spend about $60 to get a good one for curling irons.",
