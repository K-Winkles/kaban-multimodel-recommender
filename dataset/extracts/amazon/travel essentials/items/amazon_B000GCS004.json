We will be staying at a few different places over the course of our trip, and unfortunately not everywhere has a washer and dryer-SO I purchased these in case we need to wash something when we do not have a washer and dryer. These are nice and small and the directions seem easy enough to follow. I will have to report back on how well they work once we use them. I am excited to be able to re-wear things and not have to pack a ton of stuff and check our luggage and risk losing our luggage.",

There have been times when I needed something better than hand soap to wash a shirt, and this fits the bill. It comes with 3 packets, so perfect for your go-bag when you\u2019re traveling or just out camping. I love that the smell isn\u2019t too pervasive, and the small amount of detergent is enough for me to wash 4-5 articles of clothing, and the best part\u2014it\u2019s not rough on my hands. So it\u2019s definitely a good item to keep with you when you\u2019re out on the go!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for an Alaskan cruise. I know they have laundry services on board the ship, but for those that have been on cruises know it can be challenging to wash clothes so I decided to try these. I did not use these for everything, but for the clothes I did wash in the sink, they came out pretty good. Not like a normal wash machine, but the clothes were stink free and wearable. Overall, a good travel companion to wash clothes when no wash machines are available.",

Good thing they had plastic coverings ear the bottle.Today, though I received another couple bottles and one of the bottles had leaked all over through the plastic and all over in thebox. Again the cap was not tight. I estimated a third of the bottle was wasted. I can't send this back because it's just inconveniencefor cost. Perhaps if the caps were checked before packaging might help. I'm greatful nothing else in my order got covered by the mess. However, I will continue to use this product despite my complaint. I'm just bringing awareness to the fact better packaging might help.",
