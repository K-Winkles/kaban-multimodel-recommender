Easy to pack chargers/cords for my devices, and easy to find what I need at a glance. Very happy with this purchase!",

There is a little pocket below the spot for cords but not big enough for a brick to go in. Happy with purchase but would not purchase again. This did hold up well for use on the trip, in airports, and on the plane. But once it does get worn out I will look for a different option.",
