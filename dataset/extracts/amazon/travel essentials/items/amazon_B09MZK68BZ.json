I\u2019ve owned the men\u2019s version of this (grey lid instead of white) for some time now and not only does the deodorant stick stay put and can be used up until the bitter end. The scents are great, the packaging is visually pleasing and durable, guaranteeing this can truly last for a lifetime. The only problem I\u2019ve been having is that unfortunately the refill cartridges are not that widely available, and I live in Los Angeles which is a pretty major market, imagine in smaller cities? Even Amazon has limited availability of this product. Target, in all of Los Angeles, only sells the refills in three stores. It\u2019s kind of crazy to me that Dove would launch such a great product with so little support for it and close to no advertising. I have a feeling this will be obsolete very soon, unfortunately.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to love this and cut down on the amount of plastic waste that I am contributing to our environment. I do like the metal container. It feels nice in your hand. The design looks nice too.I opened the actual deodorant piece and put it in place. It was somewhat difficult to open and I noticed that it comes in a hard plastic package?! It twists onto the base and the plastic is discarded.The second time I used the deodorant stick, it broke completely off of the base at the very bottom. I now have a slippery bar of gooey deodorant and a nice paperweight.I am going to have to go out and buy more deodorant because this is completely unusable.",

                "reviewText": "I have been housing the Dove aluminum free deodorant in the Jasmine scent for years. I recently switched over to the refill concept to save money and encourage recycling. For those two reasons this product is great. It is a small, sleek compact design great for putting in a gym bag or on the go. The aluminum container is very protective of the product.Unfortunately for me I can no longer use this product because I developed what I imagine is some form of allergy. I am notorious for having sensitive skin. Like I said before I\u2019ve been using this product for years, it wasn't till recently that my armpits became red and irritated. Making my skin very sore to touch and impossible to put product on. Time to time I would notice small lumps formed under my skin. They didn\u2019t hurt but we\u2019re still noticeable. I know that this is an issue very specific to me but I advise people with sensitive skin to find an alternative deodorant. Otherwise this was a great product. Smells good and lasts all day. It doesn\u2019t have a chalky feeling and applies very smooth.",

Perhaps different scents behave in different ways. I have always used the green tea scent. I used to use the same scent back before the aluminum free refillable ones came out. Have always loved the smell and was very glad to have this aluminum free, refillable alternative. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "So My daughter has been on me to try an all natural deodorant. I seen this on Amazon and got excited because I love Dove products and I really liked the idea of saving plastic. This product smells great an I love the refillable option. Mine broke as others mentioned about on about the tenth day. I now just hold it in my hand and continue to use it, this is a bit of a pain but I wanted to give the product itself a chance.I will say I am struggling at the end of the day with odor, but this is to be expected when switching to aluminum free, which is why I wanted to try it before the heat set in. I've read that it can take several weeks to get your armpits aclamated to the natural deodorant. So products broke, but smells great, leaves my armpits soft but sadly still stinky. I'll update after a month if anything had changed.",
