If a button falls off my blouse, I have a compartment to store it so it won't be lost. You can put anything you want into a compartment so you'll have it to match a color scheme for purchase. It is sturdy and easy to open to fold out with many spaces to use for many things. It's unique and you can go forth using it for many purposes. It's what I've needed for a long time. I recommend it to others as you will not regret it. Especially seamstresses and crafters. Thank you.",

Despite going through the abuse of international travel, the container remained closed and no pills were lost. My only gripe with this product is the size of some of the compartments. I take fish oil on a daily basis and I was only able to fit 3 pills in the largest compartment; these are, however, very large pills. Overall, the container is extremely solid and durable I have no doubt it will last a long time and protect my pills.Pros:Very Sturdy/Durable - Does not accidentally open - lightweight - perfect size - lots of spaceCons:Doesn't hold lots of very large pills - sometimes small amounts of powder from pills leaks out",

I don't have mine full yet as I'm not leaving for a couple of days. you can see other items, besides pills, that fit as well. I have several pills in mine including a ring in 1 compartment, and ear plugs in another compartment. These boxes are made of a durable plastic and I am very impressed by the quality of this. The little trap doors are easy to open as well. At least with my small fingers they are. It may be more difficult with large fingers. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",
