                "reviewText": "This review is for the SUDDHO 20Pack Travel Bottles Set for Toiletries, T1 Color (neutrals).These are my favorite silicone travel bottles I've tried. I like that they have flat bottoms so I can travel with them upright or upside down. I like to keep them upright while traveling for less chance of leakage. Then when I arrive at my destination, they can go lid side down so the product is ready to go when squeezed.When the lid is tightly secured, I could not get them to leak by squeezing them.These bottles have wide openings, making them easy to fill. I really like the neutral color palette.This set also includes three hard plastic bottles, 2 with spray tops and 1 with a pump top. There's a funnel included to help put liquids into the bottles. There are 4 small jars for creams with scoops to avoid contamination. I appreciate that a bottle cleaning brush is included as well as plastic coated adhesive labels for a nice variety of beauty products.At the current price of $9.99, I find these to be quite reasonably priced. I would purchase these again.As a side note, these SUDDHO Travel Bottles Set are made in China.",

                "reviewText": "I know this said 20 pieces but I thought it was like when you get a set of food storage containers and they include the needed lids in the piece count but nope this legitimately had 20 pieces. The containers are good quality and I\u2019m loving the little scoops to get product out of the little ones plus a funnel for filling the clear bottles more easily. They thought of everything!I can\u2019t say how this held up to TSA because I\u2019m a rebel who puts this kind of stuff in my checked bag. But I can say nothing leaked (I don\u2019t over fill the bottles) and I actually had to fight to find stuff to fill everything. The bottles for shampoo and conditioner stayed in tact no spills and were easy to use in the shower. I suspect once these are empty they will pack away nicely and take up less space on the flight home. The silicone bottles seem like they will hold up for quite a while and take a beating. The plastic ones only time will tell. The spritz on the clear plastic bottles struggles a little with my leave in conditioner but the bottle I added water to for my overnight curls gave me a fine even mist. The bottle cleaner brush was a nice inclusion to the set. Overall I\u2019m pretty impressed.",

This travel set is amazing. The silicone bottles are fantastic. I filled them with water just to see if I could get them to leak and they didn't. The spray bottles are great, and I love the little round containers. I use contact lens cases currently for things like my foundation, lotion, and serums for travel, but these will be so much easier to use. I like that most everything is clear so it's also easy to see exactly what's in it. The little labels, cleaning brush, funnel, and little spatulas are all bonus pieces in my opinion - most kits don't have things like that. I'm looking forward to our next trip and being able to put everything I need together in this bag.",

I have a lot of hair so bringing one little 3.4oz bottle of shampoo/conditioner wasn't going to work. These will be my backups in the event the first set run out while on the ship. These containers feel well made, the seal on them seems durable and well-fitted, and I like the little spot on the lid for the label (which they include two sheets of). The plastic storage case they come in feels a bit flimsy and I'm not sure it would contain any liquids that might spill out but I plan to use these containers in a train case with all of my other toiletries and makeup so I'm not so worried about the case the containers came with. Overall, these seem sturdy and well made, plus the colors are lovely. Makes me want to pack for Alaska now!",

                "reviewText": "I've owned LOTS of kits similar to this one; however, none included a cleaning brush. I appreciate the little spatulas in this kit as they are very useful for filling thicker creams in the little jar shaped containers. I've not had any leaks with any shapes EXCEPT the small jar shaped containers. The air pressure inflight causes creams to ooze out and when I filled one with serum, it completely leaked out of the container.While the bag may be TSA compliant in the US, I'd HIGHLY recommend using a quart size baggy instead while flying international. Keep in mind other countries have their own security requirements and using a quart size baggy is the closest to their liter bags. I missed a flight while processing through security IN Germany because the security agent gave me a liter bag and told me to move everything from the TSA compliant bag (similar to the one sold here) and put it in the liter bag. She then said she would have to open every item to ensure it was compliant. I literally missed the 2nd leg of my international travel while in Frankfurt because of a bag.",
