                "reviewText": "Bought these for traveling on my trip to Los Angeles recently. They worked great as the size works for TSA limits and unlike other plastic bottles, these silicone ones, you can pretty much squeeze most of the liquids/creams out. It also comes with a really nice pouch which I couldn't really use since when flying all the liquids needs to be in a gallon bag. A nice addition is the stickers it comes with so you can tell whats in the bottles. I created my own with my label maker, but they are a nice addition regardless! Definitely recommend if you travel a lot. They look easy to clean too.",

The product came with stickers, but the different colored bottles itself is good to identify the product inside by color coding.. the cap is well sealed and didn\u2019t leak as I was worried about, the extra bag it came in helped organize it well.",

I have filled 2 bottles and let them sit there for a few days and I haven't seen any leaks. Hopefully they won't leak after an airplane flight.",

That is perfect for us because for linger trips I fill 2 with shampoo 1 conditioner and 1 body lotion.I actually bought 2 sets because we also take aloe vera, and body wash.I use one bottle for Avocado oil for our sweet potatoes when we dine out. These bottles really secure whatever products you put in them. They have a wide fill mouth and a squeeze function to get the product out.",
