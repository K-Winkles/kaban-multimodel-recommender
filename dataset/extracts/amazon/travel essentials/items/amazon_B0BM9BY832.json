They are also easy to use, I could still use the touch screen and the face ID unlock through the case.I used these pouches for snorkeling, swimming, and even taking photos underwater. Everything inside the pouches stayed dry and safe. The pouches also come with an adjustable lanyard that I could wear around my neck. They are very convenient and comfortable to carry.These waterproof phone pouches are a must-have for anyone who loves water activities. They are durable, functional, and affordable. They are also compatible with most cell phones, with or without a case.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to help protect my phone from water and it worked great, no issues with water getting inside. It was large enough that I was able to put more than just my phone in it. Touch screen was a little bit difficult to get to work through the plastic, but I expected that. I liked that it came with two cases so you can give the other to your spouse or keep it in case you lose the first one.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Water tight, hard to see phone selections due to reflection and some fogging",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I don't swim, but I love watching life under the ocean. I snorkel at the beach, not out at the reefs. I first tested this case by putting a paper towel in it and weighting it down in the sink at home for about 1/2 hour. No seepage. None in my husband's case either. On our Florida trip, I used it with my Iphone 12 in it and my husband on land with his Iphone 6. Mine took beautiful clear photos underwater, and initially I was having no problems with the touch screen in the case. It worked well when out of the water. In fact, the case and neck cord are particularly helpful when you are taking the glass bottom boat ride at John Pennakamp State Park, Key Largo, FL because you can't drop your phone in the water when using it, and it is protected from spray when you are at the bow of the boat going out to where the viewing area is. I easily added my driver's license and credit card to the case (making sure they were below the camera lens) and my mind was safely at ease that my valuables were protected. One difficulty is that- when you are actually in the water at a beach, and the sun is out, the reflection makes it hard to view the phone screen selections (even without the waterproof case)+ the added water drops on the outside of the case. My phone got warmer, as I was in the water for about 45 minutes each state park we visited, and the case started \"fogging\" inside, as the water was cool-furthering the difficulty of seeing the phone screen clearly while you are trying to take photos either in or out of the water. When I was taking photos under the water, I couldn't clearly see the phone screen due to the fogging and found later that many of my underwater photos somehow went to video...and the videos were very short; almost \"snaps\" of the activity I was trying to capture. Because of the wave activity, and standing in the water using the snorkel instead of floating (because I was afraid of drifting out over my head), I was buffeted about + my feet in the bottom silt would cloud the water as I was off balance. So when I saw a school of fish, I just tried, without focusing, to keep rapidly hitting the shutter button to capture as much as I could of the action below me. Obviously, sometimes I wasn't hitting the shutter, but either sliding to video or whatever. Quite a few of my intended to be video videos had the notation \"unsupported\" when I loaded them to my pc at home. I must have blindly hit something else??? Very disappointing. Some of the intended still photos came out \"EA-xxxx\". All of this must be operator error, as the touch and slide worked beautifully through the case when dry on the outside and taking photos out of the water environment. I did have a great time using the case, and took videos and stills that I never could have taken without this case, so I would recommend it....just be aware of what could happen in the hands of someone like me. I don't use face recognition. When the camera was warm, it was difficult immediately removing the I-phone from the case without danger of splitting the case seams near the opening, but in a few minutes the problem dissipated as the phone cooled and the fogginess left the case. I am posting a still shot of some type of lobster with a forked tail which ran across my foot and then hid under a rock, Bahia Honda State Park, Big Pine Key, FL and a video of fish at Fort Zach State Park in Key West, FL. I had silted up the water with my feet, so not an issue with the case. The fish at Bahia Honda around the beach tend to be brown, while the ones farther south at Fort Zach beach in Key West were colorful and only a couple of yards out. The birds were taken using the case on dry land at John Pennakamp.",

                "reviewText": "I have to admit, I didn't have super high expectation for this case given that it was so inexpensive. I tested it with paper towel prior to trusting it with my phone and there wasn't a drop of water inside the case. My wife and I used these during a cruise for a week in the Caribbean and it worked great. Aside from keeping the phone safe and dry, the picture and video quality were excellent. I now have great underwater stills, and video of stingrays, turtles, fish, coral, and a shipwreck. The lanyard buckle slips but that didn't feel like a big deal. As others have mentioned, once underwater, the touch screen doesn't work as well but using the volume button to take pictures or start/stop videos worked great.",

These pouches seem to be very sturdy and they do the job - they keep your phone dry AND keep it from vanishing as long as you use the included lanyard. Pictures taken through the pouch didn't seem to suffer in quality, and the touch screen sensitivity is adequate to do what you need to when taking photos.",
