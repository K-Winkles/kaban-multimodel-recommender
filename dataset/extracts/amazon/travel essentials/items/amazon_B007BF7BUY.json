We had to drive 2600 miles for our cross country move and I had to sit in the back seat with my daughter the entire time. I bought all 3 types of dramamine because I wasn't sure what would work best. This one worked the best. I had zero carsickness even on the non-stop winding interstate in West Virginia. And I didn't notice any drowsiness at all.",
