Not me. I wanted something I could just put on and forget about. These are perfect for that.As a bonus, the masks smell wonderful. I used them before bedtime to help moisturize my dry heels and feet. The masks do heat slowly, warming up gradually, before getting \"hot.\" I did not find the sensation to be unbearable at all. The fist time I used them it was a little weird, but I really enjoyed the gradual buildup. I do agree with the other reviews that mentioned the quality of the tabs on the booties. They aren't the greatest at securing the bootie closed. I wore a pair of socks over them since I was just relaxing in bed. That helped secure everything much better. Obviously you wouldn't want to get up and walk around, but it worked well for me.",

                "reviewText": "i very rarely write one star reviews, especially ones where i'm ranting, but these are so horrible. i bought these to try out after my 10 hour black Friday shift because my feet always ache so bad after standing for so long. I was excited and hopeful that these would solve my problems. plus, its 23\u00b0F outside so I was excited about the idea of having something warm on my feet.at no point did these get warm. in fact, I'm certain that they got even colder. and then my feet began to sting, which the package said was normal, but became very uncomfortable. i couldn't even make it the full 30 minutes that the instructions recommend.taking them off was almost even worse. when I took them off, my feet were dripping with the slimy mask. i couldn't even wipe it all off and the smell of menthol was so strong. i should've known better, but I jumped into the shower to warm up and wash off the slime. that's where it got even worse. because of the menthol, my feet began to BURN. it became even more painful to stand and let the warm water hit my feet.so basically, after my 10 hour shift on my feet, I am left with even more pain in my feet than I had before. an absolutely horrible way to end my day and I don't recommend these to anyone. the ONLY benefit of these is that my feet are now very soft, but nothing I couldn't achieve from lotion.",
