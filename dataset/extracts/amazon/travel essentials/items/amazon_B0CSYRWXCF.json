                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying this is a super clever idea. I detest paying for carry-on bags and when you\u2019re traveling for a few days or more, it\u2019s hard to fit all the essentials in a \u201cpersonal item\u201d bag that must fit under the seat. That\u2019s where this neck cushion comes into play. You stuff it with clothes. I\u2019ve got three undershirts, some socks, and underpants all stuffed in one of these and it not only frees up space in my \u201cpersonal item\u201d bag, but I now have a neck pillow so I can catch some zees on those painful red-eyes.Here\u2019s my one recommendation for improvement. I have a big neck and even with the chin strap set to the maximum tightness, it\u2019s too loose. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ve got a large safety pin to snug it up. But if the design allowed the chin strap to be about three inches tighter, it would be a perfect product and I\u2019d be willing to nominate it for the air-traveler\u2019s product of the year. Just don\u2019t back your dirty clothes in it for the return flight or you might not get much sleep.As a bonus, this is a two-pack: one for me and one for my traveling companion.",
