The costumer service and speed of response was phenomenal. The product itself is beautiful, Soft, & extremely convenient. I recently bought this for a 8 1/2 hour plane ride\u2026 And I loved it so much that I also used it in my hotel room. It is soft and warm but I also love the fact that it brings its own bag to carry it in that can easily be clipped to a suitcase or backpack, the versatility is also very nice because it can be used as a pillow when packed in its bag. On my plane, there was another girl who had one in a different color and we both raved about how amazing it is!",
