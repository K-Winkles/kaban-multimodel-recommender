                "reviewText": "These travel containers are exactly as pictured. Love the bright colors and the assorted sizes. They\u2019re soft silicone so easy to squeeze. The openings are large and easy to fill, however don\u2019t count on using the included mini funnel, it is so tiny it\u2019s really not useable. I either poured directly into the tubes, or used a regular small funnel (my picture shows the difference in size). They seem to be leak proof. I haven\u2019t cleaned them yet but they seem like they\u2019ll be easy to clean. Overall a great travel set.",

I wish it had a handle because the shape makes it slip out of my hands easily, I've dropped it about 4 times now but nothing spilled so that's good. I'm happy with it and the different options it has!",
