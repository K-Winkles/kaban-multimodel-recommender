                "reviewText": "This backpack is very stylish and it\u2019s a great size for what I needed. I go away for the weekends with my 2 year old son a lot and I needed an extra bag to put all our clothes and toiletries in, and I picked out this one because I thought it would be like a suitcase backpack. Unfortunately, the only thing this backpack has in common with a suitcase is how the zipper opens a part of the bag. It opens on all three sides fully so you can pull the flap all the way back and load you backpack that way, instead of only being able to unzip an ordinary backpack halfway down on both sides and just shoving all your stuff down until you can\u2019t fit anymore. I took off one star because, from the pictures on Amazon, I\u2019d perceived the outer shell of the backpack to be a little rigid, like a hard shell suitcase, but it isn\u2019t at all. It\u2019s just as flimsy as any other backpack material. I gave it four stars for the uniqueness of the way it unzips, for the high quality material and stitching, and for the size.",

It has a pocket and opening for a charger but not to place your phone outside the bag. That sucks for when I wear clothes without pockets! The smaller pocket on the front of the backpack is single zipper and opens from the other side, so you can't use that for your phone.I was also hoping the bag would be taller as to fit as many things as possible and still fit under the seat in an airplane.Other than that, it's a good, nylon bag with lots of pockets and pretty light. The chest straps can be hidden if you want to carry it by hand.",
