Others just weigh too much. I figured this would be a temporary stand-in until I got the one I wanted. But, it turns out that I love this backpack. At 27L, I think it is their smallest, yet it holds more than I need, and it\u2019s expandable. I love that it opens like a suitcase, instead of having to load it from the top like most backpacks. It also has an outside pocket for my iPad and travel documents. Straps are very comfortable, but can also be conveniently tucked away. Finally, the pack also looks good and the material seems tough and durable. I have a feeling I may just stick with this and never buy that rolling carry-on.",

I bought one for my daughter who is traveling to Spain soon and she said her friend has a similar bag she bought for $250.It is definitely a durable bag. Expandable side zippers, nice compartments, hidden backpack straps if you choose to not use - you just zip them up inside a hidden compartment - that's one of my favorite features actually as I hate those hanging out if I want to check my bag!So we loved it so much we have now purchased another one. The Navy/Black combo is really nice and will stand out from all the basic back bags.",

Was also able to carry my laptop (it doesn\u2019t have a laptop compartment but I have a sleeve that I used for it.).Was comfortable on my back and had no problems carrying it on the flight.Only things I wish it had was a bit more spacious front pocket, a bottle holder in the outside, and a dedicated laptop space.

                "reviewText": "I bought this bag quickly before a part-work trip because my old reliable laptop bag finally gave out. This had a good price for Prime Day and looked big enough to haul my 17inch laptop and other computer must-haves as a carry-on. I figured I would have a little room left to pack a light jacket and my purse stuff... THIS THING IS ENORMOUS! First off, the laptop section is roomy enough for the main machine PLUS all the accessories, leaving the entire main section of the backpack usable for literally everything else! I packed a raincoat, a jacket, 2 pairs of shoes, all my purse necessities, a book, a neck pillow, and 2 bags of snacks with room to spare - and that's not even mentioning the EXPANDABLE panels! The backpack straps are wide and padded and made hiking through my destination city a breeze. The grab handles on the top and side were handy when I was getting thru transportation hubs. The exterior material is sturdy and waterproof, proven as I trudged through a driving rainstorm on the trip. Importantly, I did not feel like I was carrying around a backpack - it has clean lines and no weird misplaced pockets or garish hardware colors. It's minor, but I care out these little aesthetic points! The only down side is just how huge it is - it is tooo easy to overfill this bag and get it unwieldy. I crammed souvenirs and extras into it for my trip home, and it was almost too heavy - but still without needing to expand the side panels! I would buy this bag again and again, and if you are a traveler who needs to carry a large laptop, this bag is for you, too.",

I love how it can convert to a backpack. The material is really good quality. It has a lot of usable space. It is a rectangle so no wasted space. It has 2 big zipper outside pockets. The largest easily fits my 15.6 laptop. It also has 2 straps on each side of the bag so you can compress the contents. Bonus that it has a luggage strap on back so you can put over luggage handle.",

Lo que pudiera mejorar con respecto a otros es un compartimiento dedicado para laptop ( pero si no viajas con ella no importa ) y uno externo para meter botella de agua \u2026 en gral contenta con el producto",

                "reviewText": "I can now confidently write a review of this bag after using it for three European trips since May 2022. It is absolutely fabulous! My first use was a week trip and the second and third trips were for two weeks. It is a clamshell design and if you pack efficiently (I rolled most of my clothing) it fits everything you need. During the past two and a half week trip, I bought a few extra gifts and some clothing and it was quite full. I used the expanding zipper for the first time. I had looked at $200 bags when I was hunting for a clamshell backpack, but went for this one because of some of the more helpful reviews. I was nervous because of the cheaper price and some of the negative reviews. I am so glad I did. It is solid. No sign of tearing or stress in the straps or zippers. I have walked through big airports with this on my back and it is perfect. I admit it is a bit heavy when standing with it in your back for long periods of time so take it off until you need to walk with it. The bag is so well made, very sturdy fabric, very sturdy straps and very good zippers. Very very happy with this purchase. And even with the expanding zipper open, this bag will easily fit the suitcase regulations of all airlines. So much better than a pull carry-on with wheels which don\u2019t always fit the airline\u2019s bag stipulations because of the wheels or rigid handles. And so much easier to walk with it on your back through cobblestones streets. In fact, I walked the 25 minutes to our hotel from the train station on our recent trip with it on my back while my husband had to frequently pick his case up because the wheels wouldn\u2019t go over the cobblestones streets. Yup, it was hot (35 degree weather) and I was glad to remove it but was more than happy not to have to carry it. Such a great bag!!!!!",
