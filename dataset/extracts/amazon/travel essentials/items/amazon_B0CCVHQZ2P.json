I had the bags stuffed and my entire 180lb weight on these bags multiple times throughout our trip and am amazed at the durability and that the magical valve works the way it does. You do not need any tools or vacuum or anything but your weight to make these work. Game changer for the ultra-packer in me. Saved money and time on checking bags. Paid for themselves the first trip and not one rip or malfunction of the one-way valves.",

I sent them back and will keep looking. (For comparison, I bought the Samsonite 3-pack of 3 sizes. The medium was perfect. The small was also good, except the slider kept coming off. The large bag was larger than the base of my suitcase.)",

These saved so much space in my luggage. I was able to get clothes for a week for 2 people into a medium sized suitcase with room for shoes and toiletries as well. I found the bag sizes to work just fine. I have packing cubes, but I like these vacuum bags better. I was skeptical about how compact I could make the bags by just rolling them. But it was easy and worked well, stayed sealed throughout travel and now I know they will be just right for taking to Europe to keep my luggage to a minimum.",
