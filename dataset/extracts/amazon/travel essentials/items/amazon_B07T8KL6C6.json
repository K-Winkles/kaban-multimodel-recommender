Can sit back and relax and put on a coffee table etc. I even enjoy holding it and watching the videos - can tilt the phone and be more comfortable than just holding the phone. I also like to use it to take photos with my phone - put phone on timer and take group photos. One thing that would have been nice would have been to include a thread on the base so could attach to a tripod - but no big deal, just a potential improvement. Very nice accessory.",

                "reviewText": "I fly a lot commercially for work and a lot of times, whatever airline I used sometimes didn't have what I wanted to watch for inflight entertainment. This gadget works on most seatbacks and it's highly adaptable to whatever you're trying to mount this on. I've clipped this to the top of my work laptop to watch movies while we fly aerial LiDAR and it has never been shaken loose. I've tried mounting this on my boyfriends carry on roller bag and it worked great and I was able to finish a tv episode on it. This mount is well made, incredibly sturdy and stable. It's compact size allows me to easily shove it into a front pocket of my backpack. I do wish this was quieter when you're adjusting it to the angle you want. It \"clicks\" very loudly which drew attention from other passengers to what I was doing. A few flight attendants have complimented me on this cool device. I stow it before takeoff and before landing and have never had any issue with using it on a flight. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "So, I recently got my hands on the Perilogics Universal in-Flight Airplane Phone Holder Mount, and it's been a total game-changer for my travel experience. Here's why I'm giving it a solid 5-star rating:First off, this thing is seriously versatile. It fits just about any phone size you can think of, which is awesome. No matter what phone I'm carrying, this holder has got it covered. And adjusting it to the perfect angle for watching movies or working is a breeze.The multi-directional rotation is a neat feature. I can twist and turn it to find the ideal viewing angle, which means no more awkward neck craning on those long flights. It's all about comfort and convenience with this little guy.But what really impressed me is how securely it holds onto your phone. Even during some pretty turbulent flights, I've never worried about my phone falling. It latches onto the tray table or seatback pocket like a champ.And when the flight's over, it folds up nice and compact. I can toss it in my carry-on bag without a second thought, and it doesn't take up much space.In a nutshell, the Perilogics Universal in-Flight Airplane Phone Holder Mount is a total game-changer for travelers like me. It's user-friendly, sturdy, and super practical. If you're someone who loves to stay entertained or get work done during flights, this thing is a must-have. Trust me; you won't regret it.So, do yourself a favor and grab one of these bad boys. It's a traveler's best friend, and I can't recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this phone holder for years on planes. I like to watch movies on the plane, but I prefer to have movies downloaded to my phone rather than use the back-of-seat screens (which aren't always present) where every little announcement interrupts what you're watching. This holder clips onto the tray table very well. (I pull one of the rubber cushions off of the clamp, which lets me clamp to the tray table even when it's folded back into the seat in front of me.) And it folds down nice and small when I need to pack it back up.I like this holder so well that when I (tragically) left mine in a plane (I think), I ordered a new one as soon as I had phone service again. I love this thing.I also find it useful to clip this holder to the edge of my desk when I'm at work. Sometimes conferencing on my phone just makes using my computer during the meeting easier. This bracket is very versatile for many uses in various situations.This thing works for me so well that when I (tragically) left it on the plane during a recent trip, I immediately ordered a new one once I had phone service again. So I strongly and confidently recommend this phone holder to anyone in need of such a thing.",
