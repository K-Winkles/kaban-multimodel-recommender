        "description": "Make cleaning up away from home hassle-free with the OXO Tot On-the-Go Drying Rack with Bottle Brush. This compact cleaning kit is small enough to easily fit into diaper bags or purses while on the road. It opens into a drying rack with flexible tines that accommodate bottles, nipples, breast pump parts and more. Neatly tucked inside the folded drying rack are a silicone detail cleaner and bottle brush head that assemble to form a full-sized bottle brush. The brush has soft and firm bristles for gentle cleaning or serious scrubbing, plus a soft, non-slip handle. The silicone detail cleaner scrubs tight spots like bottle nipples and breast pump parts more effectively than bristles can. Ventilation holes provide aeration for quick drying, so you can say good-bye to wet brushes in inconvenient plastic bags. Dimensions: Open: 8.5 x 10.8 x 2.2 inches",

                "reviewText": "Great and compact, virtually took up no room in my suitcase. However I use the 8 oz Dr. Brown's Bottles and they don't hold them up very well. They fell over when I would try to dry them upside down, the spikes were a little too short for them, but it wasn't a deal breaker since it is a travel drying rack, and if they were longer, it wouldn't be so compact. Brush was soft and efficient at cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "This was a real life saver for our family trips. It all folds up into a nice little box, the brush unscrews at the middle and sits nicely in amongst the drying spikes. It's super easy to clean, super easy to use. It's a smooth plastic casing so it doesn't suction to any surfaces and the brush handle does not have a suction cup, rather there is a recessed area in the box that holds the brush upright for drying. The fact that this brush is a two in one is also great! The main brush head at the top, and there is a smaller nipple brush on the handle which is hidden when you screw the handle onto the top part of the brush. The box itself is maybe 3 inches by 5 inches when it's closed, so it is super compact. We took 4 bottles with us on our latest trip and found that this held at least 3 bottles, fully dismantled, really well. Definitely worth it for travelling!",
