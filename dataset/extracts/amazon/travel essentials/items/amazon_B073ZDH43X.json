                "reviewText": "I liked that it had a combination of USB and regular 3-prong outlets, a compact round flat shape, and that it is easily accessible on my peninsula counter (where I like to charge my devices). The cord is about 15 inches long which is perfect for where I\u2019m using it, but too short to use on my office desk. Would be nice to offer a variety of lengths. Making the product with an adjustable cord might make it too large. As is, the size is small enough to not take up significant counter space. I highly recommend this product for Countertop Charging. Caveat: I have only been using the product for 1 week; seems to be perfect \ud83e\udd1e",
