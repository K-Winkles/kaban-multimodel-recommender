                "reviewText": "I love this cable, in particular I use it when traveling. It\u2019s great because it can charge multiple devices from a single usb plug, including an Apple Watch!I\u2019ve used other similar cables in the past but this one is great for 3 reasons:1. It has an Apple watch charger so I don\u2019t have to carry another charger2. The cables are color coded! It makes it so much easier to grab the one you want. Others I\u2019ve used you have to look closely to figure out which is which3. The cables don\u2019t interfere with a phone case! Others have big round connectors that won\u2019t work with a normal phone case, these are much slimmer and don\u2019t have any problem.Can\u2019t beat this cable for the utility and price!",
