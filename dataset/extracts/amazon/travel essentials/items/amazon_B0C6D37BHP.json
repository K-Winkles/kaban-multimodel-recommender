                "reviewText": "I tried installing this travel lock both in the deadbolt strike and the door handle strike, and I found both ways that the single post/screw design is just not effective. The lock is supposed to be held in place by tightening the screw so that the side post creates leverage against the doorframe. However, as you continue to tighten the screw, the whole device just leans off to the side until you are about to screw the metal wings into your doorframe (because the side post isn't long enough) and still have no stability to the lock. Also, the minute the deadbolt is undone or the door handle is turned, the wedge-piece of the lock has nothing to hold it up straight inside the strike plate, so the entire lock just collapses and it's hit or miss if it would still prevent someone from entering at that point. If the person trying to enter jiggled the door handle enough, they could easily circumvent this lock. Either way, your doorframe is going to take a beating because the device has no padding. It really needs double side posts with padding to create leverage against both the doorframe and the door so that the main screw doesn't tilt sideways or collapse as soon as the door handle moves.",

Took a little less than 2 min to figure out how to get it install properly for first time- which is fair since it was a new device and a new-to-me door. Took about 7 min to get it off. I thought I was gonna be trapped in the hotel forever. It could have been the wrong fit for the door or it could have been operator error. Either way, I won't be using this again. I'd return it if I could find the box it came in.However, if this style of door security works for you, you should know that it feels sturdy and sort of heavy, which I attribute to being higher quality. It was simple enough to install. It came in a drawstring bag. Worth a try if nothing else.",
