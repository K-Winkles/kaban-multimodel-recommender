                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I have permanent retainers on the top and bottom of my teeth. These are the ones that are behind the teeth to make sure they don\u2019t move around ever again. My dentist told me to use my waterpik as frequently as possible following a cleaning. I have the original waterpik that is large and extremely loud with a huge tank. I use it on setting 8 and it has saved me during my wisdom tooth infection. I am about to go on a 2 week trip and I needed something portable.I was pretty dubious about an off brand item on amazon and I waited a full week of use before writing this review.Pros:1. Price and value! This is the best priced portable water flosser on amazon. 30% off coupon is really useful2. Function: It is pretty potent even on the lowest setting. I would say this is highly comparable to the waterpik on setting 7-10. You don\u2019t want this any stronger. I do think the mechanism is different from waterpik. It almost works like a soda machine in the way it releases the pressure.3. Extremely quiet in comparison to the Waterpik, which sounds like a lawnmower. Your family will not notice this in the next room. This is practically silent.4. Space saving and very thoughtful design! It is absolutely beautiful on my counter! The top pushes down into the water resovoir so it can be collapsed when not in use. This is perfect for my trip and general travel. Quite portable and it can\u2019t be too small because it needs to accommodate for the water reservoir. This is the size of my iPhone 13 Pro. I love the case and the additional attachment although, I probably will ever use the one. I am going to start carrying this around in my crossbody so if I have anything stuck in my teeth during work, I\u2019ll have this handy tool.5. I\u2019m glad it comes with a charging chord and a carrying bag. It makes it easy to use anywhere.6. Good battery life. I\u2019ve been using it for a straight week with no charging. I use this probably 2x a day.7. I saw some reviewers complaining about the size of this reservoir but any larger, it will no longer be as portable.Cons:1. You need an easier way to change settings. Changing settings is annoying because it seems to be a long hold.2. I do wish there was a built in UV light like some of the other white label water flosser. You have to take this apart to fully dry. For those with hard water, you might want to use vinegar to run through this machine every now and then to prevent any mineralization jam.3. The pulsing feature is not very useful.4. I do have to refill it once if I want to do every single tooth.Overall, I\u2019d give this an A+ and would prefer this to waterpik anyday!",

It\u2019s more powerful, more compact, and easier to use. The well is easy to remove and fill with water. Which is why u don\u2019t mind filling it 2 or 3 times to clean my teeth. It\u2019s powerful but not too harsh. And the price is reasonable. I travel a lot so I love how compact it is and it\u2019s thin rectangular shape. I hope it lasts more than a few months unlike the other two I had from different brands. I will be buying another one of these for back up.",
