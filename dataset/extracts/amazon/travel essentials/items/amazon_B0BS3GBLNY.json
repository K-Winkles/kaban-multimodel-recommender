The bag is 14\u201d long and my curling iron is 16\u201d long, but I managed to get it to fit. I might just need to find a shorter curling iron, because I really like this bag.",

The flap lays down and is large enough for multiple tools and it's heat resistant. The bag has two zippers that go either direction. It has two sections on the inside. There is a clear zipper ouch inside that looks large enough for bobby pins. There are more pouches inside for other hair accessories. I love the color and the functionality. Happy shopping.",

I have used it multiple times and the case has help up after each use and has not shown any signs of burn marks. It fits both my straightener and curling iron but I do wish the interior pockets were a little larger as my hair clips do not fully fit in them due to being to long.",

It does the job, but it takes up so much space within my suitcase and, in my opinion, it's not worth the real estate. That being said, if you have the room, it's well made and designed, it provides a great mat to lay out your hot tools and not have to worry about them, and there are all kinds of great little pockets and zippered pouches inside.",

It fits two curling irons in nicely, however the pink color I ordered turned out to be more purple than I would've liked, and the material is made of Neoprene which is great for heat resistant however scratches quite easily. Still, it gets the job done and I'm happy with my purchase!",
