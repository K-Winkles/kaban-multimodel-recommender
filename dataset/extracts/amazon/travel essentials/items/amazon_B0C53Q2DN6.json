                "reviewText": "I got this light to use as a night light in my bathroom so that I wouldn't have to turn on the overhead light each time I go in there at night.This is a nice light that is compact in size and has a few different operational modes. You can set it to constant ON mode and then set a comfortable dim level. This is OK, but the unit runs off a of a rechargeable battery, so after a while, you would have to connect it to a charger. That would require a nearby outlet and kind of defeats the basic intent of whole thing. If I wanted to have a night light that plugs in an outlet, I would just use a conventional night light from the dollar store.The second mode allows you to set the unit up to turn on by using its internal motion sensor. That would be ideal for my bathroom night light use as it would save battery life and only turn the unit on when I walked into the bathroom. All was well and good when I tried it out, but unfortunately, the unit shuts off automatically if no motion is detected within 30 seconds. This is fixed internally and not adjustable.I don't know who decided on that time limit, but I can tell you from experience, if I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I am not going to be flailing my arms around every 30 seconds so I can keep the light on.Now, if you are going to put it in a hallway using the provided mounting bracket, you can set it up in motion mode, and every time you walk down the hallway the light will come on for 30 seconds (enough time to navigate the hallway of make it up or down the stairs). I am not sure how directional the motion sensitivity is, so to get the intended operation, placement of the unit might be critical (you want it to work when you walk either way, but the sensor appears to be front-facing). You can also take the unit out of the bracket and use it as an emergency flashlight.So, there is some versatility to this device, but it was a bit of a disappointment for my intended use as a bathroom night light. I would suggest that the manufacturer add an option to extend the shutoff time to something more reasonable (such as 5 minutes).Lastly, this unit might work well in a closet that doesn't have a permanent light installed. If you are rummaging around in your closet, you will probably continuously re-trigger the timer so that you can find what you are looking for before the unit times out.",

                "reviewText": "Using this light in the garage for when it\u2019s dark out. The item is about 5\" long, so it does not have a wide range of light. However, this works for us, because it gives enough light to see where we're going without being blinding. We also have it placed next to the door for when we walk in, so not being blinded is ideal. It is right next to the light switch if we need more light.The sensor works very well. It only senses and turns on when it is dark out, so it doesn't waste the battery. The light becomes slightly dimmer when it the battery is running low, which is a good indicator to charge it. Also a nice added feature to be able to take it off the wall and use it as a handheld light.Awesome device for only $10!",

                "reviewText": "Item is very small, 4.8 inches high. Made reasonably well but feels a little cheap. On the top is the LED light. A round motion sensor below the light and right below the sensor is the selector button. At the bottom is a flashlight. Above the flashlight is the on/off switch for it. On the side of the device is a USB-C slot for charging. USB-C cable comes with it but no charger. Included are also the mount and double sided sticker. Instructions included.I chose not to mount the device but simply placing it on the powder room counter. After reading the instructions on how to set the device to turn on when detecting motion I placed it in the powder room. Tested it and it came on when I approached. Supposed to detect motion from 15 feet away. You can press and hold the selector button when the light is on the lower or increase the light intensity. During my testing I noticed that the light stays on even when I switched on the powder room lights. It probably does not have a light sensor (turn off when light is detected). It does go off after about 30 seconds of no activity. The flashlight is reasonably bright. One click to turn it on. Click again to dim once and click once more to dim again. Press and hold button to turn on strobe. I have no intention of using the flashlight but it may be useful some people.Overall, it is an ok night light but I did not particularly like it that it does not turn off when room lights are detected.",

                "reviewText": "A nice little nightlight with optional motion sensing on/off function. It mounts easily with a command strip sticker for the stand, and then can easily be removed for use as a flashlight/recharging. With the motion sensor mode (that only activates when the room is dark enough to need it), the charge lasts well over a month. I haven't used always on mode because I don't have a need for it, so I don't know how long it would last in that mode.The main drawback is that the \"on\" setting for the motion detection only lasts 30 seconds. So it can mean some hand waving if you're using as a light source for the bathroom at night. It would be so much nicer if you could choose a time for it, or if it was something like 2 minutes instead.I also like that this works as an emergency flashlight in the case of a power outage - and it's easy to find too!",
