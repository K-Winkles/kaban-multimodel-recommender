This is a must so you can bring your favorite cologne or perfume with you.I got the black one for my husband and it looks masculine and elevated. I mean I love me some black and gold accessories so it can totally be female. It just looks expensive and stylish!It was really easy to fill and again I really dig the style. My favorite color is green so I might get the green for myself! I included some photos of what it looks like without the casting so you can see how easily you can fill. Overall, 10/10!",

                "reviewText": "I have tried a few brands of these atomizers and they are fairly similar but this one stands a bit above. It's very visually appealing and did not leak from the top sprayer (an issue I have somehow had with another brand). It's not foolproof to get the perfume in without a few little accidental misplaced sprays but essentially you can fill the portable atomizer with a minute or two of pumping actions between the original and travel bottles.Note that you cannot open the top to simply pour the perfume in. You have to pump it from atomizer mouth to atomizer mouth. They do include two alternative adapters, in case you have a non-traditional atomizer on your source bottle of perfume.",

                "reviewText": "A friend had given me a similar product a long time ago that got my hopes up but then leaked in my suitcase (at least it smelled good...). I got this one to replace it and so far I am very pleased.It was nicely packed and the instructions were on the box. I opened it, took it apart and put some perfume in it quickly and easily. The parts fit together well and look like they would contain a leak if it ever happened (a selling point in my book, although I am not expecting this one to leak). It took five pumps to put the amount in it you see in the picture. I will not use the labels, but it was a nice touch to have them included. I didn't need an adapter for my perfume bottle, but they are included just in case.The atomizer sprayed strongly, but with a little finesse can be controlled for smaller amounts. The bottle looks like it would hold enough to last me quite a while (or maybe be a one-time use for the guy next to me at the pizza place last Wednesday, geez). Two thumbs up! :)",
