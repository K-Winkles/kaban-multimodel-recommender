Now, it is of course, a traditional gift for that person lol. I have since tried it and I love it too. If I have it with me when I\u2019m out and I gotta go I will just go and not try to rush home. I have tried the alternatives but I don\u2019t think they work as well or smell as good. The 4 stars is because this bottle is very small and this brand runs pretty expensive. I would\u2019ve only taken away half a star if I could but couldn\u2019t bring myself to give a perfect rating for the reasons above.",

This is my first time trying a poo pourri product and my conclusion is: I had trouble with the lid seal and ended up ripping it off completely. I didn't like this at all and wanted my cute looking tube. So they definitely need like a full instruction card to come with this. The smell is okay I'm not a huge fan of it honestly. Smells kinda musty. Sprayed it in my toilet and it helps but it's not like a can of Frabeez that will completely cover any tracks. It's very light oder control. I probably won't buy again.",
