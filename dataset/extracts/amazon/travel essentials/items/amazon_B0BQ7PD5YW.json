I have used these both on travel bottles and some full size items and they work extremely well to prevent and contain leaks!They do have a ton of stretch but a few did tear a bit on large bottles when I was really stretching them to the limit, making a hole at the bottom. This actually became an advantage because I just looped that around the bottom, making it an even more secure fit!I definitely recommend for those who pack any liquids in their checked luggage. These are reusable and should last for many trips if treated well!",

                "reviewText": "Y'all!! This might be my most favorite purchase of the year!We travel a lot. When we fly, I put all of my toiletry bottles into ziplock bags because they can sometimes leak. (I do NOT like to open my suitcase and find hair product on my clothes at the start of a trip!) I saw an advertisement for these silicone bottle covers and decided to try them.As an additional funny for you, my husband opened the package when it arrived, and he asked me, \"Did you buy weirdly multicolored condoms for our trip?!?\" haha! I replied, \"Yep- but they are bottle condoms, dear!\" We had a good laugh over it.To use, I pulled the stretchy silicone over the tops of each of my bottles- shampoo, face wash, hairspray, face oil, etc. I put the silicone cover on anything that might spill out and make a mess during travel. I am pleased to report that at the end of our trip-- after six flights-- I had NO bottle spills. The silicone bottle covers worked perfectly to seal the tops of the bottles and protect from leakage. I would highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I used these for sunscreen, bug spray, and hair stuff for a family reunion in Belize. Everyone who saw them thought they were super cool. They were really excellent for the bug spray because it's easy for that to spray and make a mess but you really want to bring it around with you. We did have one of the bottle covers tear after using it for a while (the bug spray one,) but they were surprisingly sturdy and stretchy. Even the one that tore did not leak... the tear happened on the side. They could easily stretch from their 1.5\" diameter to a 4\" diameter bottle. We only had 1 have a problem, and these bottle covers meant that we could put all the bottles in the same plastic bag rather than wrapping them individually.Also, be warned: they're REALLY fun to play with; I suspect that it'll reduce the longevity if you do. ;-)",
