It is also very lightweight.I have identified one weakness of this bottle, in addition to the chemical smell, which does go away with a good green tea soak and use over time. The bottle leaks around the top rim when it is full or the bottle is squeezed and the ring at the top bends. Also, when drinking from the bottle, if you squeeze too hard, the water will gush out. It is very easy to figure all of this out after you use it a few times so that you adapt and avoid creating problems.If dropped, this bottle won't crack or break. I prefer this bottle over rigid plastic bottles.",

The hardest thing to get used to is the soft walls, and remembering to tell other people when they fill it for you! My only disappointment is the discoloration on the interior of the bottle- it looks like it is going moldy, although I do know it is perfectly clean as I have cleaned it by boiling it in water. Water still tastes fine in it but it looks awful and I just can't get past that now :-(",

It's rubbery so it doesn't stand up on its own very well when it's full of water, but I also don't think it leaked at all the whole time we used it so that's not a deal-breaker. It's easy to fold up and secure when you're done using it, and I like that it was small and easy to pack. It was great to have on hand. I think I will order a couple more before our next trip. :)",

First, it took awhile to get the smell out, and it never completely went away. The instructions gave two methods - boiling it in water or filling it with green tea. I boiled it twice and soaked it in green tea for several hours, but still a slight odor/taste remained. Second, you have to be careful when filling and drinking from it. It's made of soft rubber that's easily squeezed or collapsed. Still, I would have given it 4 stars, except that after only two days, the \"durable carry strap\" broke. Since that's also the elastic piece that keeps it folded when not in use, after that it became like any other water bottle - except easily squeezed/spilled.",
