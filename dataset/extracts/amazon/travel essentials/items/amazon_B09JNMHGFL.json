I filled it up just by pouring some into the reservoir and snapped the pump back into place. I figured it would leak after all that so I tested it and left them on their sides for a long while and rolled them all over my desk. Neither of them leaked. I'm wondering if the issues with leaking is because they filled it high enough for liquid to get in the straw connected to the bottom.",
