Unfortunately, it tends to run down on power at the most inconvenient times.I like this device because it gives me peace of mind about being able to use my phone or tablet for extended periods away from home or office. It is easy to recharge and then just carry around in pocket, purse, backpack, camera bag, or brief case. Then when I find myself with only 5% or less power on my smart device, I can whip this device out and power back up.I also like its form function design and color. It is spiffy and cool.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice power bank for your iPhone with the lightning connector. Here's why I like it. It is compact. Yes, it has a little weight to it, but all batteries do and this one provides its specified amount of power in a small package. The lightning port fits snugly into the socket on the phone, so no need to worry about thinking its plugged in but it actually isn't charging due to a poor connection. It has led indicators for battery charge level - you can see at a glance about how much power remains in the battery. No, there isn't a digital display showing exact power levels, but at this price point, the LED indicators are a nice touch. It fully meets my expectations, which isn't always the case with items purchased online. This charger works as it is described. It isn't going to charge your phone super-fast, and don't expect multiple phone charges without recharging it. The description says it will fully charge most phones about one time before needing to be recharged, and it does that. One thing to watch out for if you have a thick protective case on your phone - the lightning port is only long enough to reach through a case that is 4 mm thick. That's pretty thick, but it may not work with the extra heavy duty cases. It comes with a USB-C cable for recharging the power bank, but does not come with its own \"wall wart\", so you will need to provide your own charger. It does accept power-delivery charging, so that is a nice feature as well. Thhs is a nice, compact, portable charger/power bank at a great price.",

I plugged it into my iPad and it took 10 minutes to go from 37% to 42%. I couldn't tell you if that is fast compared to others, but I'm satisfied with it. It will be a good back up. I was a little disappointed that this didn't come with a drawstring bag to store it in (the one I bought for my phone did) but the cap will keep the connector clean at least, as long as it stays on.",

                "reviewText": "Well, this works great if you don't have a protective case on your phone. The charging port won't fit into the plug while my iPhone SE 3rd generation is in its case. I've used it in a pinch when I absolutely need to charge my phone on the go, but I have to take the rubber gasket off of the case, then pry the two pieces of the case apart, THEN plug in the charger and leave my phone sitting there out of its protective case while it charges - definitely not ideal.When I do use it, it charges fairly fast, although the charger itself dies quickly and needs recharged frequently, after about one use. (You also have to supply your own charging block to charge it up.) And the little cover on the charging port? It barely stays on and was lost within the first week of carrying it around.It's not perfect for my situation, but I'll keep it around to use in emergencies.",
