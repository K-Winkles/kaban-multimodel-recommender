Its easy to use, doesn't get stuck mid way, its very sticky so you can use one sheet multiple times and it still works, and each roll has 100 sheets. So its thicker than most lint rollers. One box will last me up to 3 months with 3 cats. Which makes it perfect for me because I no longer need to spend money on a month to month basis for lint rollers.",

I have one Lab and after 5 sheets of trying to get the fur off one cushion (there wasn\u2019t that much) I gave up. I got enough off to throw the cushion covers in the washing machine. Next issue is nearly impossible to peel to a clean sticky sheet. There is no indication as to where to start. I will tell you it is next to the handle near a spiral line, but you will have to work at it to get it started. Seems like such an easy fix for a company to make to put a mark where to start peeling.",

We have several labs in and out of our house so the pet hair is continuous and it's nice to not carry our pets love with us everywhere! Maybe call it Pet Glitter Catcher or something along those lines.",

It does the job, but the cut of the sheets makes it a pain to strip them off to get to the next one, and each sheet is only good for a few passes. Not really worth purchasing over any other brand on the market, unfortunately.**update**The seller took it upon themselves to privately contact me to apologize for my experience and make things right. I did not expect this and I\u2019m impressed with their responsiveness. Great customer service experience. I added a star for that alone.",
