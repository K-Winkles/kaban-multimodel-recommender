                "reviewText": "For all the reviews stating that \"if you can't take a good picture with an 18-55 mm then it won't help to upgrade\", I have to respond with: that is patently false. One of the only things that DSLRs are good for, in comparison to the 16MP smart phones of today, is the zoom feature and there are certain shots that you will never be able to get without a zoom.The way I look at it, these types of far seeing lenses are better than a pair of binoculars in most cases and you can also capture an excellent image of what you see at the same time! That is truly priceless, and nothing can replace the ability to take an image that would otherwise require you to be floating mid-air to get the same level of detail; maybe when jetpacks become available or quadcopter photography, but otherwise, it is impossible to get telescopic detail with a wide-angle lens, especially in places that you are not able to move closer in order to view.Additionally, the flattening effect of a telescopic photo is quite beautiful and this particular lens does produce a fantastic bokeh, as others have stated.I have attached three pictures which allow you to see the benefits of a telescopic lens.The first shows the bokeh in the lower left corner; the photo was taken at a cliff's edge. The other two demonstrate the detail of a full zoom which would otherwise have never been captured.",
