The luggage bottle holder with hook & loop is more convenient in installation and organization, but some customers are worried about the security. Therefore, we produce luggage cup holder without hook & loop to meet demands. What's the length of this suitcase cup holder? Can it fit my 24 inch suitcase? Luggage cup holder w or w/o hook & loop can fit suitcases which handles' width are less than 9.5 in. The luggage tablet & cup holder can fit suitcases which handles' width are less than 21 in. So the luggage bottle holder can fit most suitcases. What size cup can this luggage water bottle holder hold? Any container which diameter is less than 10 in such as 32 oz hydro flask, travel coffee mug or water bottle and so on. Will the pouch fit an iPad? Yes.

Easy to slide on and off. A bit too wide for the standard Samsonite luggage handles so I keep drinks \u201csitting\u201d on the front side of the luggage rather than hanging off on the back. Pockets are great for cell phone, book, iPad, sunglasses, gum and other nicknacks you need handy while waiting for your flight without having to dig into your personal item - purse or bagpack. Pictures show two standard water bottles but can hold a venti size cup just fine. It has mesh in the bottom part so condensation does go through but it doesn\u2019t create mold at the bottom. Easy to wash with the rest of my clothes in the washer inside a mesh bag. The only thing I wish it had Velcro to secure it tighter to the handles instead of the elastic but otherwise great product. Thick material not cheap. Price point was ok for the quality you get.",

But what about hot coffee, or a fountain soda? Are you going to hold it while you eat? How about while fumbling around for your travel documents?These issues no longer concern me now that I've got this slip on cupholder. Firstly it folds flat and is lightweight so I keep it in the pocket of my carry on at all times.It's easy to attach to the handle and over once it's on there it's not going anywhere. I've been able to hold everything for large Starbucks or Dunkin coffee cups, to 20 ounce fountain drinks, bottled sodas etc.Flaps on the back end are ideal for holding travel documents, your cell phone and/or a backup battery to charge electronics.And when the time comes to board, it detaches and can be packed away quickly and easily.Altogether I highly recommend.(quick note - I'd be sure to only use this with upright, 4-wheeled carry on suitcases or risk spilling your drinks by dragging bags behind you).",

It awkwardly accommodates two venti Starbucks cups but at least they can't tip over and most drinks that I'm likely to carry would be smaller so it'll be perfect. Anything bigger would probably be too big to keep smaller drinks upright. And it's insulated!",

Digging through colouring books and extra clothes to get to a water bottle can get tiring fast. I strapped the caddy onto my suitcase, put our water bottles in there, and instantly felt more organized.",

The velcro fasteners are very strong - no worry about coming undone or falling off. Held my 32oz water bottle, cell, passport case with no problem to allow a free hand. And once on board, detaches quickly and folds up nice and small and flat for easy stowing in my carryon bag. Highly recommended.",
