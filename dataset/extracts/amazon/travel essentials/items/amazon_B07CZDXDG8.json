                "reviewText": "We purchased our second INIU Portable Charger and it has quickly become an indispensable companion for the on-the-go lifestyle. From its sleek design to its powerful performance, this charger has exceeded my expectations.The compact and lightweight design makes it incredibly convenient to carry in my pocket or bag. It's the perfect size for travel, and I no longer worry about my phone running out of battery during long journeys or busy days. This became extremely helpful on my recent overseas trip. Never had to work about my iPhone running out of juice.The charging speed is impressive, delivering a quick and efficient charge to my devices. The 10000mAh capacity is more than enough to keep my phone charged multiple times, and the dual USB ports allow me to charge two devices simultaneously. This feature has been a game-changer allowing it to charge both my iPhone and iPad at the same time.I also appreciate the thoughtful design details, such as the LED indicator lights that accurately display the remaining battery power. It's a small touch, but it adds to the overall user experience and helps me plan when to recharge the power bank. Including a flashlight is a handy bonus, proving to be surprisingly useful in unexpected situations.Overall, I can't recommend the INIU Portable Charger enough. It's a reliable and stylish solution for anyone in need of a portable power bank. Whether you're a frequent traveler, a busy professional, or just someone who wants to ensure their devices are always charged, this charger is a wise investment. It's become an essential part of my daily carry, and I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE this charger. I have never used a portable power pack before, but bought this one as a hurricane was approaching three years ago. I guess I got lucky because this one has been a gem.If you know electronics, you can skip this, but if you are like me and figure things out as you go, here is what you need to know. You attach this with a cord to a wall outlet to charge it. You could use the included cord, although it is very short. Put the USB-C (smaller) end into the in/out port (hole), and then plug the larger end (called USB-A) into the square'ish block that is on the end of your telephone charging cord. Then plug that into the wall and this will power up your INIU portable charger. The little blue paw print will come on and you can watch it charge, from one light to five (fully charged). Mine never takes very long to charge, but it's never really drained. (I hear you should use most of the charge before recharging to maintain life of the charger, but I cannot control when a hurricane is coming, and that's usually when I charge it.)When you need to power your device, you will connect it to the charged INIU power pack. You will now use any of the OUT ports (holes) in on the INIU to connect the charger to your device. You might have to use the cord that comes with your phone to do this if your phone does not use a USB C plug. Simply detach that cord from the square box that you plug into the wall and put that end (USB A) into OUT 1 or OUT 2, and the other end into your phone. Your phone should now be charging from the power pack. The blue \"Paw\" lights will indicate that the power pack is in use and how much charge is left in it.If I have confused you, I promise it will make more sense to you when you actually do it. Remember the IN port is for electricity to come INto the INIU to charge the INIU. The OUT ports are for the INIU to send OUT power to your device. Be sure to do this BEFORE you desperately need it.I have dropped this multiple times, including on my garage floor, without damage. It is the size of my smart phone, but a tad thicker. It charges my phone fully twice before I need to charge the INIU power pack again. I assume you can also charge this in the USB port in your car, although anything I ever plug in there seems to take a long time to charge, so on the way to the airport might be a little late.This has saved me in power outages, but also in other circumstances. I was stuck in the Instanbul Airport with a massive amount of people and not a plug to be found. I was able to charge my USB powered sonic electric toothbrush with this when I forgot to charge the toothbrush at home. I gave one to my handicapped mother for her Kindle, in case she ran out of battery and did not want to fight getting up to plug the Kindle in.If all else fails, if you go to the ratings/comments/questions section for this item, you will find a user guide and manual hidden there. But since I did not understand the in/out and different kinds of USB plugs, I was lost for a while.",

                "reviewText": "[Edit/Update as of October 19th, 2023] I used two different 5 volt 3 Amp USB C cables to compare the charge of that of the USB A to USB C cable that comes included with this power bank. One by Samsung that came with my s23 Ultra, and the other by JXMOX. I wasn't surprised at all do discover that they both delivered a minimum based fast charge that you would see from a PD charge below a 25w output.I would also like to add, the power bank does not have a IPX rating. It is not water resistant.I like the slim design and portability of this sleek little power bank. Came with a nice little traveler's bag to keep it from getting scratched or dinged in my backpack on my commute to work and back home. Although this powerbank doesn't support true Super Fast Charging, it still does support PD fast charging for my s23 Ultra. it's great for topping off my battery back to the max 85% I have set my s23 Ultra to max charge at. A neat feature that I started using after I purchased the device, and that will help in the longevity and overall health of my battery's lifetime. So this little fella makes for a great accessory to have. I also like the little built-in flashlight. Cool little added feature for finding things in the dark like my earbuds or a USB C or USB A cable. There are only two downsides. It doesn't support super fast charge for my device, and it takes a bit long to fully charge the power bank itself. I can live without its inability to super fast charge or fast charge, which I knew before purchasing it. I don't know of any super fast charge output power banks out there. I didn't find one while browsing here on Amazon. The power bank would require more mah voltage and wattage. Which would translate to a higher price. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and having the convenience knowing that if I need a little juice for my device or earbuds, I can just plug right into the power bank on the fly. Package also arrived in great condition as well as everything inside. No dings dents burrs spurs or cowboy's boots. Pleased with my purchase.",

L'aspetto, il peso, i milliampere-ora (mAh) di 10.000 quindi mantengono la carica pi\u00f9 a lungo, la custodia da viaggio morbida per power bank, il cavo di ricarica USB-C e la confezione in cui \u00e8 presentato e il costo ragionevole rendono sicuramente questo prodotto (per uso generale) uno migliore di molti altri pi\u00f9 costosi che non vengono forniti con un cavo di ricarica e hanno meno mAh.

                "reviewText": "Necesitaba una bater\u00eda para llevar en la mochila ya que viajo bastante en avi\u00f3n y a menudo mi tel\u00e9fono y auriculares se quedaban secos, as\u00ed que estuve probando una que ten\u00eda en casa m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a y antigua, pero ten\u00eda una capacidad de carga bastante limitada y enseguida se consum\u00eda. Me decid\u00ed por esta esperando que pudiera durar lo suficiente y que no se descargara demasiado r\u00e1pido entre viajes, y la verdad es que me sorprendi\u00f3. La capacidad es alta, te permite recargar sin problemas y le sobra para volver a hacerlo por lo menos otras tres o cuatro veces (a\u00fan no he llegado a comprobarlo porque no he tenido necesidad de agotarla, pero s\u00ed he recargado un par de veces y el indicador estaba por encima de la mitad de potencia), no es pesada y se adapta bien a un bolsillo peque\u00f1o en en la mochila, desde la cual puedo sacar el cable USB tipo C sin necesidad de extraerla del compartimento. Tiene hasta una peque\u00f1a linterna muy \u00fatil para buscar cosas en el fondo de la mochila, lo cual es otro extra. En general buena compra, funciona perfectamente y me resulta muy \u00fatil, aparte de que no es cara en absoluto.",
