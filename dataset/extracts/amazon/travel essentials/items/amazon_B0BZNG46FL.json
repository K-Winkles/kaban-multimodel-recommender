Was easy to move out of the way during the day. Small-ish size fit well in my luggage. I totally recomm nd this for when you don\u2019t need a surge protector or cannot have one (cruise ships).",

                "reviewText": "This little guy is a keeper. The desk footprint is minimal, the configuration of the outlets is compact but doesn't crowd the plugs, and the way it wraps for storage or travel is a dream. Three outlets and a port -- what you need on the go, not at your desk or in your office. The icing on the cake for me is the flat wall plug and five foot cord, again, space saving and just enough. Get at least two, you will want one in your work bag and one in your overnight travel case at all times. And the kids will steal it.Recommended!",
