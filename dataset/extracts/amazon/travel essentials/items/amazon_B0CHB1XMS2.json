                "reviewText": "I just updated my review and I have just ordered an additional two packs of these power banks. I am super impressed. Not only do they charge the phone to 70% capacity but they allow pass through charging.This means that you can charge the power bank and the phone simultaneously using one cable. Because this power bank has the USB female connector on the side and the USB male connector in the middle you can plug the power bank into the phone and then plug the power cable into the power bank and charge both at the same time. This is a huge benefit. Some of the plug-in power banks have the input socket immediately adjacent to the male USB C plug. With this configuration you cannot charge the phone and the power bank at the same time. With this power bank, you can plug the power bank into the phone then plug your charger into the power bank and put it on a charge at bedtime and when you wake up they both are fully charged.I've also gotten used to leaving the charger attached and to be honest, I don't notice much usage difference. The phone feels just as light and compact with the power bank attached as it does without it. In some instances, particularly taking photographs, it actually stabilizes the phone because I hold it by the power bank on one end and the phone on the other end. That is why I purchased an additional two packs (four) of these.These are actually great little portable power banks. They snap onto the phone and you can carry and use the phone normally with the power bank attached quite easily. They are lightweight and they work and feel better than having a 10,000 mAh power bank tethered with a cord.I did a test by first fully charging the power bank. Then I let my Galaxy Z Fold 4 run down to 25% and attached the fully charged power bank. It charges a little bit faster than 1% per minute. In 30 minutes the charge went from 25% to 60%. It charged the phone up to 96% before the power bank died. The phone was off during the charging so that I could measure the rate of charge without the consideration of any apps or processes running on the phone that drain the battery.Thus, you can get roughly 3,000 mah of equivalent battery power from a fully charged power bank. My phone has a 4,400 mah battery and charging 70% that's roughly 3,000 milliamp hours.The dual pack is really perfect as two of these would give you roughly one and a half full battery charges. I highly recommend this unit because it charges the phone decently and the in use attachment is much better than a larger power bank with a cord.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this charger since October 2022 and I am very pleased with it. It doesn't take extremely long to charge. The four indicator lights let you know how the charge is progressing and when it is fully charged. It holds a charge for a long time too. I fully charged it right before Thanksgiving and did not have to use it. It is now over 2 weeks later and it still has a full charge (see pic). I keep this charger in a small zippered case in my handbag when I travel with it. I keep the zipper a little open so it doesn't overheat. I don't think the charger will overheat if I had the case fully zipped but that's just me being paranoid. I once had an iPod Nano that I kept in the same little case (fully zipped) and it exploded (literally!!). My charger came with 5 of the little black caps for the USB C connector in case it falls off/gets lost. The cap stays on pretty snuggly so I have never had an issue with it falling off. I highly recommend this charger.",

I\u2019ve given it a few test runs and it charges my iPhone pretty quickly but in return it drains the portable charger faster. Not a huge complaint but something to think about if you\u2019re going to use it multiple times on one charge. I think it will be perfect for traveling and having it on hand just in case I need a quick charge to keep my phone going.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Google Pixel 4a (5g) with a pretty thick case. I needed to literally run it nonstop for videos one day--about 6 hours. It has TERRIBLE battery life now--I have to charge it multiple times a day during normal use!I bought the two-pack of these, and my phone's battery stayed charged! I did need to go through both batteries (neither lost their entire charge, but I'm a worrier), but considering this was almost all videos, that's fantastic. The charge doesn't last as long afterward as it would if you had used the manufacturer's cord, but that's the case no matter what you use to charge your phone.It stuck firmly into my phone, even through the thick case. They never fell out except for when I dropped my phone--oops--and that didn't cause any problems. Though you shouldn't drop your phone, just in case. Or in general. They even survived sticking on my phone while in my very full purse and being bumped around as I ran through airports.The charge probably lasts 4+ hours, even if you're nonstop videoing.They are a little heavy, so if you're planning on moving your phone a lot while you use it, you may want to take the charger out during that.I also took these through airport security twice, and they didn't cause any issues. I mean, I can't promise anything because you never know with TSA, but I had no problems even after they had to search my bag for unrelated reasons. (I am quite dangerous with a multitool in my wallet!)I'm planning on buying more, not because these will die soon but because I want to make sure I always have one on hand/in case I lose one, which I will.This is likely the best tech purchase I've made in a while. If you're considering something like this, I assure you this is the product you need.",
