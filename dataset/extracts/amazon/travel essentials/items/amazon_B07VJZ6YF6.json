                "reviewText": "First thing to note is that there will be creases and fold indentations when using these. Tough to fully straighten out. Even if you try, cannot get it back to its original flat form (not for perfectionists). Afraid overtime something will snap inside and render a section uselessThis product is basically a bendable metal (?) wrapped/stitched in leatherYou can fold it into any shape you wantHanging off tables and other appliances is mixed. It can work, but not all the time without support. Must be creative with the balancing or use other objects to help hold it in placeFor example, hanging off the table. The stock photo with a backpack is impossible unless the backpack is empty or you have a paper weight on it. Stock photo with the headrest, your headrest weight must have pressure on it. For car vents, must fold a tiny curve to hang on the backside which is not that easy to do, plus the weight hanging off it may damage your vents overtimeIt is flat and good for travel, but you must know the limitation and ways around it",
