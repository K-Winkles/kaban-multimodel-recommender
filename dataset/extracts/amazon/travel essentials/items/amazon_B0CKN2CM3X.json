The vibration you get inside a OHV is often pretty bad and the plastic and metal bottles often get destroyed with rub marks on them when they have been beating around inside the travel box. This particular bottle doesn't do that. Yes it gets rub marks but it doesn't really damage the overall look and feel of it. And they stay water tight even with all the bouncing around. I highly recommend it for those who need a solution for the UTV water problem.",

With hot and cold liquid, it holds up well. One of the best features is that it\u2019s dishwasher safe, which is incredibly helpful. Really nice bottle.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my next plane trip. I took another bottle with me the last trip and it leaked into my carry on tote. What a mess. I will also try it at my aqua class at the gym. I have a problem with dropping water bottles and they break. I will have to get used to the pliability of the silicone as it makes it a little wobbly but it does stand up on it's own. I like the size and shape, easy to grab with wet hands. I also like that I can roll it up and throw it in my gym bag when not in use. I filled it with water and shook it up and squeezed it to see if it leaked and only under pressure did a drop of water come out from the spout. I think it's going to do the job I wanted it for. Warning. If you fill it up to the top and then open it, hold it by the cap because if you hold the silicone part the water will shoot out the top. It's a no duh moment, but sometimes you don't think about it",

                "reviewText": "This bottle is really nice. It had a slight scent when I first received it, but after a few washes with soap, it went away.The bottle is small, therefore would be great for shopping, airplane travel, or short commutes. When empty, it folds to half its size for easy storage.I haven\u2019t used it for anything other than water, but it fills easily and doesn\u2019t leak when it falls on its side. After I finished the water, I folded it up and put it in my backpack. It doesn\u2019t take up much room at all. Great bottle to have.",
