For heavy things like pants and tops I used a plastic hanger over the shower bar. It easily attached from the shower head to the opposite end of the shower bar, wrapping the bungy cord end around the bar and back into itself to secure it. Perfect. Fits back in the included fabric bag! Quality item. Won't travel without it now.",

The line is thick enough to hold the weight of clothes that were not ringed out properly. It was also very easy to adjust the length of. The line it self is very stretchy but durable. I highly recommend this for the quality it's self. Plus you can't be the price of $5. This by far beats the experience Bungie cords that break easily.",
