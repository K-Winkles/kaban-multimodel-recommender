The sock's material is rather (very) stiff and the toe region is very unforgiving. It's made like a straight line, not taller on one side or anything, and so there's always extra space on one side (near my pinky toe) and not enough room on the other (on my big toe). I wear a size 8 in womens btw. It feels like it pulling my big toe most the time and the extra room can be annoying.

                "reviewText": "I bought some other compression socks and couldn't even get them past my calves. This was after I tried my own size (per package) and 2 other larger sizes. I'm older... not strong enough to pull them up I guess.These socks are similar in strength to the ones they put me in at the hospital after surgery. They come all the way up to my knee and don't slip down at all. These also have a regular sock toe which I think is more comfortable. I did show my doctor, and he approved the strength for me. Love the colors too.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these socks for travel and general daily wear when I\u2019m sitting at my desk for 9 hours. I found them to be just okay and cannot determine if they really helped with my circulation.I also wore them on 2 flights recently and my feet didn\u2019t swell. But they usually don\u2019t anyway unless I\u2019ve been eating salty foods before boarding.The annoying thing I found was that the foot, especially in the toe area, was too wide. This allowed the seam to move and rub my toes, which was uncomfortable. I believe another person had mentioned something similar and commented that maybe it would better fit wide feet people?Well, I learned the answer to that is no. I wear 8W in women\u2019s shoes and bought these in small. Definitely room to improve in the design. Perhaps it\u2019s the material but the seam is very noticeable when worn for long hours.If I could return them, I would, but I\u2019ll probably pass my unworn pairs to someone else to see if they like them more.",
