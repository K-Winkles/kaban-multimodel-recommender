I wanted a single bag to combine toiletries and makeup, though I ended up having more toiletries for an extended trip overseas. Yes, it carries a WHOLE LOT OF STUFF, organizes it easily, and the hanging feature meant I didn't have to entirely unpack toiletries for my average 2-to-3-night hotel stays. I have the medium size and it's bigger than a vintage metal lunchbox, so it did take up suitcase space. If I were traveling only with a carryon roller bag, this kit would take up almost one quarter of the entire inner space\u2014a consideration for shorter trips. Also, not leakproof, but I know that's asking too much! Was quite convenient overall.",

This one is FAR better than my old one, which will now go in our guest bath.I filled this with all my normal travel stuff to make sure it would all fit conveniently, and to share in this review.WOW! I LOVE how each larger pocket has a lower zipper for reaching the smaller items without having to dig from the top - genius feature!Also, there are plenty of elastic straps of various widths to tightly hold brushes and wands of various sizes.Every feature of this bag is thoughtfully placed for the traveler. And if you\u2019ve never had a hanging bag like this, get this one now! It is a game changer for saving space (and messy clutter) in any hotel bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "This toiletry/essential tote is the BEST! It is absolutely unbelievably durable, sometimes I pack it and just know it is not going to zip or I\u2019m going to ruin it but each and every time it zips, but never to the point of pulling the the threads around the bag tote or zipper (that\u2019s too far, I wouldn\u2019t do that because eventually the threads will come loose and you will destroy the bag). I\u2019m just saying you can carefully pack all your toiletries, etc. and be good! The hanger in the bag allows you to hang your bag on a hook or the top of the bathroom door. The cosmetic section in the front of the bag is a smart and well used addition. I LIVE THIS TOTE! And yes, it is compact enough to fit into your luggage without taking up too much room. I must inform you, even though I love this bag, the straps to hold bottles in place aren\u2019t the best. It is possible your small bottles will slip right through, but overall the straps do an okay job keeping your body wash, lotions, and larger bottles in place. I just make sure my small bottles are closed tightly & place them in a small place ziploc sandwich bag and still put them in my tote. I have never had bottles to open or any mess once I open my bag. The smaller pockets allow for razors/shavers, toothbrushes (2 or 3), regular size toothpaste, polish remover, makeup pads, earrings, flossers, JUST SO MUCH! This is a Great Buy. I only write reviews for items I\u2019ve purchased that supersede my expectations or that are completely awful (I think I\u2019ve only written 4 or 5) so YOU CAN TRUST THIS REVIEW. I have not been paid or compensated to write this, as a matter of fact I\u2019ve had this bag for almost a year. I will try to include a pic of my bag and how I usually pack it if I can figure out how to do so.",
