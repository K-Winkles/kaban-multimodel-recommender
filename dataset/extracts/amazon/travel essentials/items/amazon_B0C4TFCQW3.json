I am a nurse and the hospital air just gets stuffy, especially with masks on. This little fan attaches to my cart perfectly and blows a perfect gust of air right in my face whenever I need it, especially during hot flashes, so that I can maintain safety and keep my mask on without being sweaty and miserable! I LOVE it!!! It plugs into the cart and can be recharged to use without a plug at any time. The colors are beautiful pastels that I have bought (green and blue) and to be so small, this is a powerful little fan. It's quiet enough that I can use it in a hospital setting and small enough to keep it on a small portable cart. Very lightweight and keeps the air flowing around me! I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This fan has been a LIFESAVER during my summer trip to very hot and humid Japan. It is lightweight for its size, has 3 speeds that are all useful, not too loud, and good battery life. I like how the fan is removable from the base for charging. That\u2019s a great design idea! The legs were super useful to hang the fan, hold it like a handle, or stand it on a table, but as you can see in the photos, after 3 weeks of moderate use in changing leg arrangement, the legs broke off. The last one broke while taking photos, so now I just have to hold it and can\u2019t prop it up or hang it. I\u2019m hoping I can jury rig some new legs and/or hanging apparatus when I get home. This would easily be a 5-star product with the leg issue fixed.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for traveling to a warmer locale with baby. Used it to keep bassinet in the stroller cooler but also just at night for white noise and air ventilation. It worked great and never ran out of charge (I charged it about every day just in case and ran it throughout the day and all night no problem). It's a good size, easy to travel with and stayed attached and positioned well (I didn't have high expectations for getting a strong grip, but it rotates so many different ways I COULD reliably aim it directionally as needed and it stayed).",

                "reviewText": "Let's be real, summer picnics can be brutal. You're out enjoying the sunshine, but the minute the breeze dies down, you're left battling a mini heatwave. That's where this handy little stroller fan (seriously, it's the size of my water bottle!) came in and saved the day.Clipped to the picnic basket, this little guy kept the air circulating and everyone comfortable. It's got three speeds, so I could adjust it depending on how intense the sun got. Plus, the flexible tripod legs let me angle it perfectly, whether we were lounging on the blanket or munching on sandwiches under the shade of a tree.And the battery life? Amazing! It lasted the entire afternoon without even a hint of dying. No more scrambling for outlets or melted ice cream \u2013 just cool, happy picnickers thanks to this tiny dynamo. If you're looking for a portable fan that punches way above its weight, this is the one. Highly recommend!",

Charging the fan is easy and the battery life is great, and the arms make it easy to position this anywhere or to prop it up on a table. The breeze it sends out can be strong (which is GREAT in a Southern summer) and the price is good. Will likely purchase more in the future!",

Easily charges via the chord provided so you never have to worry about swapping batteries. The fan has 3 power modes for different levels of air flow. We love how quiet the fan is! My wife even used it throughout pregnancy to help with hot flashes when sitting on the couch, out at a restaurant, in a warm outdoor setting.Now, the fan is going to be perfect to attach easily to our stroller or car seat to help keep baby cool whenever necessary. The tripod legs are strong and can be wrapped around most surfaces to provide a good, secure, hold.",
