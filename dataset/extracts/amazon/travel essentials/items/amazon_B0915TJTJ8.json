With that being the main one I use, I kind of felt defeated. It is also kind of important to note that I tried to fit my Bluetooth headphones into one of the small pockets, and it kept wanting to come out.If you have pets, please note that dog hair is very visible on the pink option. I did not have it for very long, but this was something I quickly noticed.I don\u2019t doubt that this product could be amazing for some people, but for my situation, it just made more sense to return it and purchase a different organizer.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical, there's almost too many reviews, but herd mentality really worked out for me here. Compact while having plenty of storage space. The outer material is a bit scratchy, but reasonably durable and with good color. The zippers are fairly robust, have a nice loop to pull them by, and are sewn into the outer layer so that it doesn't catch on the inner material. The mesh pockets aren't the strongest, but they keep cables from slipping out while in use. The unit collapses very slim without much inside, and expands reasonably well with the flexible material. One should know that items large enough to fit in the larger pockets may prevent you from being able to fit in the smaller pockets. It's nice that the large pockets are there, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't expand enough to overpack. Includes 5 cable ties, which was a huge plus for me. Given the price, this is really it! Extremely versatile: works for bags, travel, toiletries, stationary, etc.,",
