                "reviewText": "I recently switched over to an electric toothbrush and needed something to cover my brush head. I've only ever used traditional toothbrush \"travel\" cases. (Generic ones at the Dollar Store or travel bins at Walmart.) Was quite hesitant to purchase these brush covers initially based on the various reviews online. However, upon using them, I'm quite delighted. The mint smell/pouch definitely keeps your brush smelling pleasant and fresh. As long as you clean off your brush and dry it off with a tissue before capping it, it holds up fairly well.",

                "reviewText": "Loved that this was like a butterfly clip toothbrush cover rather than a snap closure since those tend to wear out quickly. I figured the minty vapors wouldn\u2019t last very long and it didn\u2019t go away about a week after being opened and used. It was nice while it lasted but it didn\u2019t do much to the brushing experience.",

We had a house guest who was with us a few nights per week for several months and this was perfect for sharing a bathroom with the rest of the household. Also it's great for travel, it does not take up as much space in your bag as a full length toothbrush holder would. Highly recommend!",
