                "reviewText": "This little gadget is incredible, especially for the price! My husband has to go out of town on buisness trips. We just moved into a new apartment complex and although I feel relatively safe, I'm an idiot and listen to a lot of true crime podcasts. Lol. Plus our door only has one lock and it just made me uneasy. Once you get the hang of how to use this item, which honestly took me once or twice to get, it's so easy. It will keep your door shut even if it's unlocked. I highly recommend this. I might even give it as stocking stuffers this year for Christmas.",
