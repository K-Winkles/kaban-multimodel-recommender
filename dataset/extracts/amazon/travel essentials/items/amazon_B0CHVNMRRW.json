                "reviewText": "This review is for the SpassLeben Travel Bottles Set for Toiletries in the \"D\" set of colors.Firstly, I chose set \"D\" because the design really appealed to me. I particularly liked the silicone tubes with the leaf design, which added a unique and pleasant touch to the overall aesthetic.The silicone tubes were definitely the best part of this set for me. They not only looked nice but were also exceptionally functional \u2013 no leaks, no spills.However, the small clear jars didn't quite meet the same standard. I used two jars on a recent trip, and they both leaked - one just a little, but one quite a bit. I'm considering skipping these in the future. Thankfully, the silicone tubes alone made the set worthwhile for me.Overall, I found this set to be a helpful and visually pleasing addition to my travel essentials. Despite some leakage issues with the small clear jars, the silicone tubes alone make this set a cute and practical set for travel.",

                "reviewText": "I used this kit for a vacation where I had it in my checked luggage on the airplane. Overall I really liked it. The 3 oz bottle I used was great. It was easy to fill, did not leak, and was easy to use once I reached my destination. The larger funnel is now the best small funnel I have in the house with multiple uses. The labels were quite convenient to use. As a bonus, the left over items will be great for crafting use.The small jars are great for putting small items in, like an Apple air tag. Unfortunately they do not have a rubber seal, which I would not expect for this low price. I used 3 of them to hold gel products in my checked luggage, and at least one of them leaked, though not so much that it significantly lowered the amount of product I had. Thankfully I had placed them in a ziplock bag.",
