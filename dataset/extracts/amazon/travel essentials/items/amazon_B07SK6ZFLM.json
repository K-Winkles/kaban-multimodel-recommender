The price is reasonable enough I figured I would give them a try for my 9 hour overseas flight, as I struggle with serious hip pain from sitting for hours if my feet aren't up. First off, this was so easy to use. It doesn't take up any extra room in the already cramped area you get on a plane. Secondly, it was very easy to adjust the hammock to fit my needs perfectly.I have never had a more comfortable plane ride in my entire life. I don't think I can ever fly without this hammock.I am very short, so it's just not comfortable for me to fly without having my feet up. With the hammock I had zero hip pain and was so comfy i was able to go right to sleep. I gave the other one to my dad to use on our flight and he agreed this is a game changer for flying!",

                "reviewText": "We were recently on a plane for 9 hours and I used these to keep my legs moving during the flight. Once installed you can swing your legs back and forth which was so helpful. My legs usually go to sleep or I have to cross and uncross my legs to get comfortable. But you can adjust the height of the foot rest so that made it very comfortable.The one draw back was that both feet would sink to the middle and would scrunch together. There are other options with a solid bottom to keep your legs separated- if I were shopping, I would try those out. The drawback to the solid bottom version is the packing- the soft ones are easy to fold and pack. I\u2019m not sure how easy it would be to pack the hard bottomed version.",

Honestly, my feet got numb from being squished together. It did help give me a variety of leg room options, which on a long flight was nice. But I couldn't use it consistenyl for the whole flight (or more than an hour at a time). Decent for the price, but not for long-term comfot.",

I am also someone who sits most comfortably with my feet tucked up but I don't like the idea of kicking the back of the chair in front of me while I'm shifting and disturbing other passengers. This foot hammock was fantastic for finding solutions to all of the above. It is compact and comes in a travel pouch. It is easy to set up even with people sitting next to you and it is easy to adjust to as long or as short as you would like. If you are interested in buying this type of product I would highly recommending purchasing this one.",

You slide the strap between the seat and the tray and it dangles down. If you fidget too much, it\u2019ll definitely disturb the person\u2019s seat in front of you. It takes a hot minute to get the height adjustment right because inevitably you\u2019ll have a bag under your seat and that cuts into your hammock space. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll use it again, and my partner ended up not being interested in using it because of disturbing to person in front. Otherwise, it\u2019s sturdy and I wasn\u2019t afraid of breaking it, and it\u2019s moderately comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I used this on a couple of four-hour cross-country flights and found it to be great. A caveat to that, though - I was in premium economy, with more legroom than regular economy, so my review is based on that experience. The strap for the hammock fit nicely over my tray table, either with it open or closed. The padded part, where your legs go, was durable and comfortable and the strap was easily adjustable so I could get it to a comfortable angle. The carrying case is a great \"extra\" and really makes it easy to pack into a carryon without having to worry about hammock getting damaged or the strap getting tangled.I was on a night flight on the way out, and found it helped my sleep having my legs stretched out and a bit higher than if I'd just stretched them out under the seat in front of me or slept while in a sitting position. Coming back I was working on my computer, and having my legs elevated made the flight a lot more comfortable. My knees didn't hurt nearly as bad as when I usually get up after sitting for a long while, and it was easy to get my feet in and out of the hammock when I needed a bathroom break without having to detach it from the table first.",
