                "reviewText": "I primarily use Apple devices (iPhone, M1 Macbook, iWatch, iPad mini 6, AirPods Pro 2) and this cable has been very effective for every one of them. I have several other multiple connector cords, but they will only charge one device at a time. It's a welcome option to be able to use this cord to charge my devices simultaneously. I was also encouraged by the ability to use either a USB A or USB C connector on the charger end of the cable, which adds significantly to its versatility.Another unexpected benefit is the ability to use it to charge my M1 Macbook, although the charge rate is relatively low. Be aware that this is charging cable only; it will not support any data transfer between devices.The workmanship on this charge cable is excellent; the connectors are solid and connect well to the device being charged. The wireless charge component has a strong magnet and links up well with my iWatch or AirPod case. The cord is covered by a 24 month warranty, which can be extended to a lifetime warranty - just utilize the QR code on the packaging to send an email (including your order number) and you are covered.All in all, I would highly recommend this versatile charging cable, both for home use and for travel.",

                "reviewText": "The cable works if you are looking for a device with multiple plugs. One thing to note is that this device does NOT work very well if you do not have the right charger. You can use all the plugs all at once BUT you are not able to utilize the charging speed efficiently. I do not really understand why it got rid of the micro USB for another lightning. It does not do ANY data transfer for any of the ports. The cable is ONLY meant for charging. This is a type c (or USB A adapter) to apple watch, 2x lightning or type c. I like that it comes with a type c to usb a adapter if you want to plug it in via USB A. The light color is nice but you can see it get dity overtime. The cable itself is not too bad and feels slightly thicker than the apple cable so it's harder to break or fray. As for charging, this works with any charging from your laptop USB to the a portable battery pack but be aware that the medium determines the charging speed. You could use this to charge devices at once but again that splitting power three ways will significantly slow down the charging time. Speaking of charging, this cable does not support fast charging at least for the type c port and my samsung phone. It works decently with my apple watch and has a stable connection. The neck of all the heads is pretty sturdy but I am not sure if they will fray in the future or not. Overall this is a good charging cable to have if you just need a charging cable for several different devices. Be aware that the charging cable does not have data capability. I like that this cable gives you the option of type c or USB A and that the converter is actually attached so you are not going to lose it.",
