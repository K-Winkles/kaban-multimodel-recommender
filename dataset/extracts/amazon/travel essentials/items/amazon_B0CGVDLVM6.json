It also has the removal mesh bag for sponges or cotton balls. The clear pocket in the lid can house smaller eye pencils, lipstick, eyeshadows, jewelry, hair ties, hair clips or other items. It\u2019s tall enough to hold perfume, facial serum, toners and more. The handle makes it easy to move the case from cabinet to suitcase, etc. not sure about durability since I haven\u2019t had it for long but should it fail in the future then I will update my post.",

                "reviewText": "This travel bag is even better than I expected! I travel quite a bit for work and this bag can hold ALL of my travel necessities. For me, the necessities include oil cleanser, normal cleanser, toner, exfoliant, essence, moisturizer, sun screen, foundation/skin tint, travel shampoo/conditioner, leave in conditioner, travel mousse, plus any jewelry I plan to wear, hair ties, a razor, bandaids, retainer case, AND a small container of medication. The zipper is high quality and the bag appears to be pretty water resistant.The only downside worth mentioning, although this may not matter to most, is the vertical style. This is the first bag I've owned that is vertical where all bottles can sit upright. This is great in terms keeping everything upright and for saving space horizontally, but if you plan to have this bag inside a backpack or any other bag, keep in mind you wont be able to put much on top of it - for example, placed inside my backpack, I can only put a few things next to it and nothing on top of it. I am still giving a 5-star rating because this is something I don't mind and others probably expect buying a bag that is cylindrical in shape. Overall, this is a great \"grab-and-go\" travel bag that holds a ton! Definitely recommend! *photos pending",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had a small simple black vegan leather makeup case for years, and it\u2019s served me well, tucking easily into a drawer or suitcase, taking up very little room. Alas, it\u2019s finally starting to fall apart. Been looking for a replacement, but it\u2019s quite hard to find a small one anymore. Most are much bigger than I need, designed to hold a Kardashian amount of makeup.I finally found this one by Icramsy. While it's larger than my old one, it\u2019s smaller than most others out there. It\u2019s also more of a vertical orientation than I\u2019m used to. Before, I\u2019d just throw the makeup in the old case, horizontally on top of each other, and then fish it out as I needed it. After travel, it\u2019d usually get all jumbled up. This new Icramsy makeup case is much more organized, with several elasticized pouches all around the interior edge. So now I can place mascaras and eyeliners vertically in one pouch, blush in another, foundation in another, all neatly standing up on end. They are much more accessible and easy to grab. Inside the lid, there\u2019s also a handy clear pouch with a snap, perfect for small things like nail scissors, foam applicators and hair bands. There\u2019s also a mesh pouch on a tether. Not sure what I\u2019ll use that for, but it\u2019s a nice extra.Because of its bigger size, I can even add in more products - tall sprays like deodorant, perfume and mousse. It\u2019s more than just a makeup case, but a toiletry one, to boot. The zipper is situated at about 3/5th of the way up the case, which is something new to get used to. On the plus side, it allows the tops of the tubes to show and be easier to grab when the case is flipped open.I ordered the case in black. The outer material is not very luxe, more like a thin nylon dopp kit rather than a leather look. The red interior is actually a nice contrast and makes the dark cosmetic containers easy to spot.While I was initially disappointed it was so tall, I\u2019m now seeing it as a positive and enjoying the extra storage space. Overall I\u2019m quite happy with it.",

I personally did not like the red interior afterall. It works great for what it is, but it is nothing elegant or fancy if that is what you're looking for.",

Sturdy, but the zippers still pull easily which is a hard combo to find! Love that the inside is red to help see items better. Pockets are perfect and it's a cute little bag! Love it!",

How squished is this thing in there?Pretty squished, apparently.
