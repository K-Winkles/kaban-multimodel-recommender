                "reviewText": "I was really nervous about ordering this, but I am ecstatic with the product! Headed out on a long cruise this spring and really needed something that would allow me to bring along all of my necessities, but without extra wasted space. This bag is excellent.First, it has such a great plan for proper organization. Spaces for bathing products, spaces for cosmetics, spaces for medicine/sunscreen. I love that it is all waterproof in case of leaks, but I don't see that as a big problem as it is well-padded.There is a fantastic waterproof, removable pouch to take to the shower -- a big plus in a small cruise cabin. I can make space for my partner with very little effort. This smaller pouch also has a metal hanging hook so I can leave it ready to go in the bathroom.The larger bag with it's hook means I can create my own \"space\" in our cabin, where my toiletry needs are at my fingertips. When the main bag is hanging on a hook, the jewelry pouch is on the back side, but it's design that it only opens about 45 degrees means that my jewelry can still be accessed easily but won't fall out. I don't know if they designed it this way, but I am thinking that my jewelry on the back of this will be more secure.The jewelry pocket is also lovely. With a plush lining, and plenty of snaps, pockets, and other ways to secure my jewelry, I am sure that it will save me time, protecting the jewelry at the same time.Yes, I got this for a cruise, but I know I will be using this toiletry bag in so many ways -- of course, all traveling, but I'm also thinking to the gym, to the hospital, even camping. I love that it has the strap that allows it to be securely attached to a trolley suitcase.Finally, this toiletry bag is well-made. The materials are excellent and the stitching is of the highest expertise. I'm sure this toiletry bag will last for years to come. Marvelous product!",

                "reviewText": "This is honestly the best toiletry bag I\u2019ve ever used! It\u2019s the size of a small handbag & has an unbelievable amount of storage. The exterior has a sleek, elegant look with thick, sturdy leather handles. Heavy duty double zippers with large pulls. The inside of the bag has multiple organized compartments. Includes a hanger, makeup brush pocket, elastic bands to secure bottles, removable shower bag with hanger & a plush jewelry pocket. I transferred items from my old, overpacked, toiletry bag (that I could hardly zip closed) into this one & had room to spare. I just kept finding more items to pack to see how much I could actually fit inside \ud83d\ude04. The plastic material is thick & wipes clean easily. It also has an outer pocket for items you made need quick access to & a band that allows it to slide over the handle of your suitcase. Fantastic bag for traveling. Will keep your makeup & hygiene items secure & waterproof. I couldn\u2019t find a single con about this cute little bag. It\u2019s a well-made, stylish, bag with abundant storage divided into well-organized compartments. I highly recommend this for traveling. Would also make a terrific makeup bag.",

I can organize my things and then close it up for travel. When I take it out to use, my things are still very organized and I had no mishaps of spillage. I was able to hang it in the bathroom and use my things with great convenience. I am super happy with this travel bag and its versatility. Lots of compartments to organize in. It is a little bigger than some but it works well for me.",
