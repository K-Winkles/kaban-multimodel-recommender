The ports are just enough and perfect for my necessary on-the-go devices and the flat plug makes fitting it in narrow spots much easier.

If only everything else were as thoughtfully designed as this is.There was a small issue with the USB ports not powering in the first device I was sent, but the seller was super quick to send a replacement which worked perfectly.",
