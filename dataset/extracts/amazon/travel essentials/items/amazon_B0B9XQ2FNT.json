                "reviewText": "Omg, words cannot express how much I appreciate this invention!! They are handy for so many circumstances. I\u2019m a full-time RV-er and every winter our RV park shuts the water off if there\u2019s even a threat of a freeze. Sometimes it\u2019s off for 8 days straight. Instead of lugging jugs of water to flush the toilet every time I have to urinate, these were helpful, albeit kinda pricy seeing as how they only hold 800 cc of liquid. They could certainly be larger in volume and frankly they could have a much better absorbency material inside. (The travel Jane brand has a really good absorbent material in theirs)Gotta have knee surgery soon, and I can imagine these will be helpful in that circumstances as well with limited mobility and such. Overall, I\u2019m just really happy something like this exists, and I will re-order.",
