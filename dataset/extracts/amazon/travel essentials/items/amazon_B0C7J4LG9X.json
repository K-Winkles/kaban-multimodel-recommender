However, I have been using this one myself and find it works very well, especially to clean after #2.The design is just right to reach the areas needed. It really cuts the amount of tp needed, and leaves me assured of cleanliness. I do add two drops or so of body wash, not enough to need a rinse. I don\u2019t carry it with me generally, but if I was traveling and could fit it in my bag, I would.",

I have been using the Tushy Portable Bidet because it's very compact and easy to use. However, I like the Cynpel Peri Bottle more. The stream is stronger and the bottle holds more water. Although the bottle does not collapse to a compact size as the Tushy bottle, the spout can collapse into the bottle making it more compact and easier to pack when traveling.The product is well made, easy to clean and use. I highly recommend the Cynpel Peri Bottle to clean your tushy. It reduces the amount of toilet paper you use and you feel cleaner.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as diuretics send me to the bathroom numerous times during the day. I was starting to get irritated due to the frequent wiping. This makes such a difference - just a squirt & dab. Much fresher feeling. Consider this a \"bidet in a bottle\".The upturned spout makes it so easy to use. The several holes give it more of a sprinkler action instead of a forceful stream.The bottle is a nice size and easy to squeeze even with my old arthritic hands. This would be a great product for caregivers to use for their clients. Much gentler & fresher than using toilet paper.",

                "reviewText": "This peri bottle has been a lifesaver during the postpartum period. The design, particularly the bent head, makes it significantly easier to use compared to the ones provided in the hospital. The angled nozzle ensures better control and precision, enhancing the overall user experience.The functionality is excellent \u2013 it works exactly as intended and provides the relief and cleansing required during the postpartum recovery phase. The material is durable, and I haven't encountered any leakage issues, adding to its reliability.My only minor wish is that the bottle were a bit bigger. While it gets the job done, I find myself running out of water faster than I'd like, which can be a bit inconvenient. A larger capacity would have made this peri bottle even more practical for extended use.In conclusion, if you're in need of a postpartum peri bottle, this one is a great choice. It's effective, user-friendly, and the bent head design sets it apart from others on the market. While a larger size would have been ideal, the overall performance and convenience make it a valuable addition to the postpartum recovery toolkit.",

                "reviewText": "My elderly parents at their home had a bidet connected to the commode's cold water since no outlet for having warm water. My dad with dementia needed help when toileting, but quite the shock to use! When I got home, decided to try this for myself (also had no good way to hook up to electricity). I fill with very warm water and use to help clean after toilet paper. Easy to squeeze, holds enough water for a pretty good cleaning, doesn't leak when turned upside down until squeezed, and angle is great; I only wish my mom and caregivers had known about this while my dad was alive...",

What I love about them:- Set comes with 2, so you can keep one upstairs and one downstairs without having to run around your house trying to find where you left it, especially while you're still recovering- The angled sprayer is more comfortable, ergonomic and easy to use compared to the regular bottle my hospital gave me- Comes in a drawstring bag in case you need to travel or want to store them for a while- Cute colors! Not a necessity but it's still nice.",
