Surprise, surprise, it worked beautifully! Now, the only drawback is, this brush is a little heavy and if you drop it on a tile bathroom floor, it will break, so be very careful when using it. But I would say it's WELL WORTH the money, and I don't understand how a brush can make such a huge difference in detangling hair, but this does.",

My 5 year old daughter has very thin hair and curly and gets knots all the time. At one point we thought we were going to have to it all off.Ever since we got the bad knots out this last time and started using this brush every few days, she has NEVER gotten her hair like it was before. This brush is magic. If this was back in the day where there were witch trials, the creators of this brush would be in trouble. I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m an engineer and I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t understand how it works but it just does. This brush saved my life bc I\u2019m telling y you now, triglycerides were through the roof and dealing with my daughters tangles was rough. Now, it\u2019s never ever an issue.This is the only brush you need. It\u2019s magic. It defies gravity. I mean I logged into this account I share with my wife JUST to write this review after having it for many months now. Absolutely amazing",

They detangle my hair so easily that I hardly ever feel a thing! I used to dread brushing my hair, but now, I quite enjoy it. It also does not hurt or pull on my scalp when brushing. It's easy to hold and made with top quality plastic. I have bought this same brush before and it lasted me about two years before all the rubber tips on the ends of the bristles started falling off. However, this is typical of any brush, and I think these last longer than most brushes. I highly recommend this brush! It will change your life!",
