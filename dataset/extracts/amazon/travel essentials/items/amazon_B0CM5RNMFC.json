This is definitely a novelty, I put it over my plastic travel size bottles of conditioner, shampoo and oil and there was not a single leak. It's so flexible that it's still tight and as good as new after removing it with multiple uses. Can I take it on the airplane? Of course you can, for airplanes, trains, automobiles, cruise trips, etc. I've taken them through many cities and they've always worked perfectly, long or short distances, silicone covers are very easy to carry. Is it disposable? Does it really work as well as described? It works very well! Not only is it reusable, but it's also very easy to just wash it in water. It's exactly what I expected. You simply pull them off to cover the top of the container. Elastic sleeves are a great sealer to protect your products. Will these work for standard size? Yes, these are very flexible and fit round, oval, any shape and more. They are also flexible when using them and can stretch to fit all or most toiletries.",

These sleeves slip over your bottles in order to prevent them from bursting open and if they do leak slightly they can contain the small amount of spill that might come out. These have a fairly impressive stretch to go over a variety of size bottles, and are easy to clean if they do get dirty. The size of the bottles will dictate how far down the sleeves will go, so it will vary depending on the bottle. I haven't been concerned about any of the sleeves tearing, or anything like that which is good. For the price, if you travel with anything larger, or that might be prone to leaking, these sleeves could be extremely helpful, and I would recommend them.",

They are like thick, stretchy balloons that hold your liquids in the bottle for travel. I call them bottle condoms. (Let's see if that gets past the censors!)PROS:- Washable and reusable- Durable - Altho they seem thin, I tried to rip one and couldn't. They should last a long time.- Flexible Range: There are 10 sleeves, all the same size. I am able to use them on bottles as small as 1\" diameter, and stretch them for ones as large as 3 1/2\". It could probably go a bit bigger, but that was a already a stretch. : ) All formed a tight seal that wouldn't let liquid leak.- They are thin enough that I was able to put one over a bottle and still put the cap on it. That's great for leaving the sleeve on while in my luggage, but just using the cap that comes with it when I'm in the hotel.SUGGESTION: They are all the same size, though different colors. I would have preferred a variety of sizes, including one a bit smaller to fit over the stem of an open bottle of wine. I did try to put one over an open glass of wine - and that worked.",

This might be the limit for this product.* The product seals well when they are stretched a bit.* The product compresses nicely when they are not in use.CONS:* It would have been useful to at least provide two, perhaps three different sizes in the pack.* The product packaging should warn users of potential choking hazard.NOTES:* Keep in mind as you stretch this product over larger diameter containers, the material gets significantly thinner - like when a party air balloon is inflated. Therefore, any sharp-like object that comes in contact with the product surface will likely tear it open.* The manufacturer could have just made them all the same colour, like white or clear.* The seal might be less than optimal when a paper bottle label crosses the seal boundary. So beware.SUMMARY:This is a practical product that saves you dealing with a potentially messy travel bag. In addition, they are easy to rinse and reuse.",

I could see the cover stretched very thin on a bottle and thought it would rip. It didnt! I have pretty long and almond shaped nails.
