We usually just shove all of our cords into a gallon size ziploc bag and shove them into the top of our toiletry bag.This makes things so much easier. Nothing gets tangled or misplaced; everything has it's own little area and I can easily tell when something goes missing.I have even started carrying this in my work tote to organize my regular odds and ends.My Nintendo game and watch fits nicely in the back pocket, but I switched it out for my larger emergency charger.... now I have to find a new pouch for my game and watch.Overall I would recommend to a friend, and will be purchasing 2 more of these- one for travel as I enjoy having this for everyday use, and one for my teenage son.",

Really a bummer of a case. Her pencil case would have been a better organizer than this one. The unfortunate thing is the next size up would have been too bulky to fit in her backpack. The smaller size is great, the construction of the internal pockets and the middle divider renders it difficult to actually use.",

Typically, when we travel, he ends up with a bunch of cords thrown in a gallon bag, and I end up with multiples of the same cord held together with hair clips. These bags helped us each organize our cords for a trip over the holidays. We had everything needed to charge our items and this if 2 kids.They\u2019re very handy to have around the house, one upstairs and one downstairs. I put tiles on them so can find the bag easily. I know where to go to get a cord and where to put one back when I find it in a random location.",
