                "reviewText": "We liked that it was fairly easily to pair both my husband\u2019s, then my, earbuds with this model. It does work great for watching shows together that I had downloaded onto my iPad. In that case this plugs into my older iPad\u2019s jack, then we can both watch a Netflix show together without bothering those around us. Unfortunately, we found that we cannot use this type of jack when we are flying business class overseas. At least on Delta, as we usually do. Their fancy earphones rely on a double jack plug.But we have also used the AirFly for taking cruise excursion tours. They provide wired \u201cQuiet Voxes\u201d which allow you to hear the guide, but which require wearing the thing hanging from your neck and a long wire that attaches to a looped earpiece. Very unwieldy. Now, we each Bluetooth to one of the QuietVox things, which is small enough to fit in my purse. With the AirFly attached to the top, it still all fits in my 8\u201d high crossbody purse. We both wear our ear buds and aren\u2019t tethered to wires like all the others in our bus tour group are. It works wonderfully for that.The battery life seems quite long, and charging is a snap. The included charging cord is rather short, so we used our longer USB-C cord. Also, pairing with earbuds/earphones is easy, and checking if the power is On or Off is also easy. We recommend this to anyone for its variety of uses.",

                "reviewText": "The Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver has proven to be a reliable and versatile companion, enabling me to enjoy wireless audio wherever I go. This nifty gadget effortlessly bridges the gap between my AirPods and devices with a 3.5mm audio jack, earning it a solid four-star rating.The standout feature of the AirFly Pro is its seamless connectivity. Pairing my AirPods or wireless headphones with various devices like airplanes, gym equipment, TVs, iPads, and more has become a breeze. This has enhanced my audio experience during travel, workouts, and entertainment, allowing me to enjoy my favorite tunes or shows without being tied down by pesky cords.The dual functionality as both a transmitter and receiver is a significant advantage. Whether I need to transmit audio from my TV to my AirPods for late-night viewing or receive audio from gym equipment, the AirFly Pro has got me covered on both fronts. The versatility of this device makes it a valuable addition to my tech arsenal.The battery life of the AirFly Pro is commendable. With up to 16 hours of playback time on a single charge, it can keep up with my on-the-go lifestyle. Additionally, the USB-C charging port ensures quick and efficient charging, making it ready for use whenever I need it.The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around in my bag or pocket. Its unobtrusive size and simple operation allow for hassle-free setup and use. The included travel pouch adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring it stays safe and secure during travel.One aspect that could be improved is the audio latency when used as a transmitter. While it generally performs well, there is a slight delay in audio transmission, which might be noticeable during fast-paced videos or gaming. However, this is a common issue with wireless audio transmitters, and it does not detract significantly from its overall performance.In conclusion, the Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver is a reliable and versatile solution for wireless audio connectivity. Its ease of use, long battery life, and dual functionality make it a valuable tool for enjoying audio on the go.Despite a minor audio latency issue, the AirFly Pro delivers on its promises, providing a seamless and cord-free audio experience.

A note, although most have the single plugin, some planes still use the two prong connection. AirFly does have this same version with the 5.3 adapter, but you can use your own adapter if you still have one. This is small, easy to carry along and great to use. Awesome sound quality. Another thing\u2026the cap that covers the plug when it\u2019s not in use. Easy to drop and lose on a plane as it will roll. You might consider attaching a keychain to the top so you don\u2019t lose it. Great product.",

This Airfly device allows me to plug it into the radio, and connect my JBL earbuds, making my radio monitoring completely wireless. I love it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s also perfect for its intended use (listening to in-flight movies on airplane seat backs), but I don\u2019t do a ton of flying! lol.
