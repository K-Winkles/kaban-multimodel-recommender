Plus, the durable material gives me confidence that my items are well-protected. A must-have for anyone looking to declutter and organize their space efficiently!",

These bags are a great size of large and fluffy comforters, pillows, duvets etc. there is a blue slide that is intended to help you seal the bag better, but they popped off easily while sliding and I had to go back over the double zip lock with my fingers because it wasn\u2019t sealing with the blue tab.The bags came with a very handy hand pump that worked great but also took a LONG time to use for the size of the bags. But I didn\u2019t mind because it got the job done for half the cost of other bags with electric pumps.I waited a week to write this review because I wanted to see how the bags held up. Sadly after 4 days two of the three used bags inflated back up completely. I chalked it up to my poor packing and re did it again. Sadly, they were puffed back up in only two days this time.I can\u2019t be fully mad because you get what you pay for, but - I wouldn\u2019t recommend these to anyone else. I\u2019d keep looking and get the better quality bags.",
