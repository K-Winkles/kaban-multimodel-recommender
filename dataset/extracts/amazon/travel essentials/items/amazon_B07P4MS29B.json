I was able to keep all my clothes well organized throughout the trip. They are easy to store in drawers at the hotel, and they make packing up to leave much less stressful as long as you keep your stuff in the cubes. They keep your clothes neater because you can roll up your pants, shirts, etc. I also liked the laundry bag it came with. They are a decent size and if you roll up your clothes and pack and organize them carefully, they will fit a lot. They fit at least 6 days worth of clothes for me. The material was also very good. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "We used these for an 8 day trip to the Bahamas. I packed all of my clothes in them. I used the S, M and L cubes. I didn't need the XL, because I didn't take bulky sweaters or jackets. I also didn't use the shoe bag because I like to wrap my shoes individually. And, because I took 7 pairs, including 2 sets of heels, so it wasn't practical bc they didn't fit and I didn't want the flip flops all over my white sneakers. The pics show my stuff when we got back. I wish I would have taken pics before we left to show how perfectly neat these cubes held all my clothes. In the pics, the L bag is half empty, so I rolled it up to position it next to the other 2 cubes on the trip home. The laundry bag is big enough to hold 9 changes of clothes (no jeans, but 1 jean shorts). So, what you see next to the empty pink bag was everything else that fit in the 3 half empty cubes in the suit case. The suit case is 27\" long, 18\" wide and 10\" deep. When the cubes are full, they are pretty heavy, approx 5 to 10 lbs, depending on the size of the cube. I will never travel w/o these cubes. My clothes were organized and stayed exactly how I packed them. And, when 1 of our suitcases got too heavy, it was sooo easy to transfer the cubes around between the 2 big suit cases and 2 carry-ons. Last year, we went to Cancun with the kids, before we bought a suit case weighing device, we had to open all of our suitcases in the middle of the PACKED airport, trying to shift the weight around between 6 suitcases, grabbing random clothes. There were underwear flying around all over the place! It was awful! Now, all we have to do is weigh, rearrange if necessary, and go. Now, at the hotel, the cubes went into the drawers and my clean clothes never touched the hotel drawers. So, when I got home, the unused clothes were completely separate from the used clothes, they were perfectly clean and I didn't have to wash EVERYTHING (used & unused, like I usually do). My husband didn't want to use all of the cubes when we were packing. He regretted that decision later lol.",

I purchased the turquoise color because that's my vibe. The zippers on these cubes are good quality and the fabric they are made from is breathable and lightweight. I was able to pack several days of clothing into three cubes, two pairs of shoes in one shoe bag(which I love, it is my favorite!), and toiletries into another bag. My husband liked the packing cubes so much that we ran out to a department store to purchase another set for him before we traveled. We spent about $10.00 MORE for his set, they appear to be good quality, but the zippers are smaller and do not slide as easily as the set I purchased on Amazon. I got the best deal and the choice of beautiful colors. Highly recommended for frequent fliers.",
