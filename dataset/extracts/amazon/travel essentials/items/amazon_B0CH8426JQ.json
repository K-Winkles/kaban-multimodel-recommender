                "reviewText": "Ordered this for traveling to the EU. Have not been over there to test it yet but have tested it off the 110V here in the US (The USBs still worked even though this is not a voltage convertor!)I love the amount of outlets on this adapter and believe we'll have no issues on our travels based on testing here at home. The only criticism I have is that the 2 pin AC outlets are a little on the looser side than some of the adapters we have. Still safe and not a big deal.A small note on some of the negative reviews. The product page allows you to purchase two types of this adaptor Type C (for most of Europe) and Type G (for UK/Ireland). You can also choose to order a pack of 1 or a pack of two. When you place your order make sure you are ordering what you want - both quantity and type. Ordering a Type G and then complaining it doesn't work in Europe is not a product fault.. it's a user fault. Ordering a pack of 1 and then complaining you don't get two is not a poor product description.... you get the picture.These things work and if you like the look of the design you'll get what you order. No issues here. Solid. 4 stars.",
