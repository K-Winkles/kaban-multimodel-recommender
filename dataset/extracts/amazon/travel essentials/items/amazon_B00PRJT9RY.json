                "reviewText": "I like everything about this product. My husband and I both use them. You know what I mean when I say I don\u2019t seem to get clean from toilet paper alone. Enough said. We previously used Preparation H \u201cTotes\u201d but they changed the packaging and they got really hard to tear open. I saw these on Amazon and we\u2019re now on our 3rd box. The turquoise color makes them easy to locate in my purse. They are a full sized sheet, soft, wet enough to be effective, odorless (although I\u2019ve never given them a sniff test!). If I\u2019m heading out without my purse or pockets, I\u2019ll stick one in my bra to have on hand. The packaging is not stiff and doesn\u2019t make a loud crinkle sound. They are perfect for taking to work, travel (very handy on an airplane), out running errands. I\u2019ve used them as general handy wipes when we couldn\u2019t wash our hands. Since they\u2019re made for \u201csensitive areas\u201d, there\u2019s no alcohol to sting. That probably means they don\u2019t disinfect like Purell, but that\u2019s okay for general use. It\u2019s also important that they are flushable and safe in septics. At home, we keep regular containers of wipes in our bathroom. It would be wasteful to use these at home. They are designed perfectly for using while out and about. I see there are other similar products out there, but this is the only one we\u2019ve tried since the Totes. Very happy with Stall Mates and will keep on ordering.",

I'll definitely order again. I ike them.",

I always filter my products according to customer reviews and it's a shame that I myself never took the time to write reviews. So finally I have decided to write reviews so I can help other buyers make the right decisions.I recently took a trip to India and did not want to carry a giant wet wipes pack. I spread individual packets over my carry-on, checked, and personal items and did not have any airport issues! I used it to wipe clean my body off of humidity and sweat in India. It came in super handy in my bathroom visits to village areas where no water or paper was available. It left me feeling fresh and clean! the size is also very generous as compared to other wet wipes, and I loved how it was not dripping liquid as some wet wipes do. So if you are traveling to India or even anywhere then it's a must-have! just stick some of these in your purse and you are good to go! I would recommend it 100%",
