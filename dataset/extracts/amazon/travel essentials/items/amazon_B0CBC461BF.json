                "reviewText": "I love having soft silicone bottles for my shower essentials when I travel and, between my fiance and I, we have 4 or 5 different sets that we rotate through on our trips. I am really happy with these! Compared to other ones I've used, I like that the opening of these (when you take the cap off) is wider so they are easier to fill and easier to clean out after. I was a little worried with how easy it was to get the caps off, since that could also mean they just pop off when in your bag, but it didn't end up being an issue! The travel bag this set comes in is surprisingly nice! Usually the bag included in these sets is useless, super fragile, and not worth using. I always toss them and use my own bags but I genuinely used the bag it came with this time and it was great! I haven't tried the facial towels yet (I forgot them on my last trip) but I thought that was a nice touch that I haven't ever seen in any of my other kits! The colors are what drew me to this kit, and they don't disappoint in person. Really cute! I also appreciate that the label goes on the side of lid, instead of on the bottom of the lid. Since you stand the bottles up with the lid down, it was really great being able just see the labels easily, so I appreciated that design choice as well. These may feel like silly details, but when comparing these different sets, these are the things I am starting to notice! This sets stands out as a good one :)",
