I used to use a lot of washcloths but they got nasty pretty quick because the water wouldn\u2019t dry properly after washing my face day and morning. These aren\u2019t just one time use, as long as you squeeze all the water out of them you can use them again and theyll be fine. I usually will throw one out once it smells or has been used for a bit; they can also be used for cleaning (I used one for my Keurig and mugs and smaller items). Good value for the price, had mine for a bit now and I still have plenty left!!",

They also feel very soft against my skin and don't pull at it either.I do reuse these so they get a lot of use out of them. They are easy to clean and then dry back out quite quickly (so I am not afraid of them harboring bacteria).They are so convenient to take and use. They don't take up a lot of space, whether in your drawer or in a travel case.Lastly, good price for the money.Overall... I'd highly recommend these!",
