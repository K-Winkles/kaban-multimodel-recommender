It seemed to hold quite a bit, I had one pocket for make up, one for my 3 ounces of liquids, one for medication and another for miscellaneous. Even though I had it stuffed quite full it did fold up nicely and fit well in my backpack. Only reason I did not give it a five is because of the flimsy hook, it seems like it will probably break pretty easily at some point. The outside looks very nice and the pink color is not too bright.",

                "reviewText": "Hey fellow travelers,I just got to spill the beans about this toiletry bag that I recently snagged for my travels. You know how we are always in search of that one bag that can hold all our stuff without being a monster to carry around? Well, I think this might just be the one.First off, the material it's made from is just top-notch; it feels durable yet soft to the touch, promising to last through many adventures. I can already tell it's going to be my travel buddy for a long time.And let's talk about space because this bag is slender yet can fit a surprising amount of stuff; it\u2019s like the Mary Poppins of toiletry bags! I managed to fit all my travel essentials in there without any fuss.Now onto my favorite part - the rotatable hanging hook! It's such a lifesaver in hotel rooms where counter space is basically non-existent. I could just hang it in the closet, and voila, everything is in sight and easy to reach, making the whole getting ready process a breeze.And of course, who can ignore the waterproof feature? Because let's face it, spills happen, and this bag just shrugs it off, keeping everything inside safe and dry.All in all, I am absolutely loving this toiletry bag. It truly stands as a champion for both men and women with its spacious yet slim design, providing a hassle-free experience while jet-setting. Do yourself a favor and get this travel essential - your future self will thank you!Safe travels and happy packing!",

Upon opening the bag I saw that it was covered in dirt and mold spores. (I can confirm these are mold spores because this happened to an old pair of shoes of mine a few years ago). Really disappointed, I will be returning :(",
