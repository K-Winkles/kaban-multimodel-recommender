I was traveling out of state and was tired of packing a ton of charging blocks and hoping I could find enough outlets in my hotel room. This made charging all my devices so easy and keep them together. I loved the built in usb ports as well. This is now a travel must have for me! It also is pretty compact and no bulky in your luggage!",

It allowed my husband and to both plug in and I also charged my watch and iPad. I love that it has the usb port, usb-c for newer devices as well as regular plugs. I loved it so much that I use it at home on my nightstand. The only negative is that at home it will sometimes fall off my nightstand if I pull the cord too much and it would be nice if it had a way or organize or \u201ccontain\u201d the cords. Would recommend!",
