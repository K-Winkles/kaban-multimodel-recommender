You just squeeze the soft silicone sides of the bottle to dispense your product.I found them to be leak-resistant, too. I am not sure how they\u2019d work with thin liquids like mouthwash or oil\u2014 I didn\u2019t risk it\u2014 but they work fine with shampoo, lotion, etc. The caps fit tightly and nothing leaked during travel (these were packed in checked bags, not carry-ons).Of note, there is a limit to how \u201cthick\u201d a product can be and still work with these bottles. I tried filling a bottle with a facial cleansing balm (semi-solid at room temp, about like Vaseline). That didn\u2019t go so well. The product would not dispense and I had to remove the cap and scoop it out with my fingers.Overall, good reliable travel bottles.",

The bottle is soft silicone so you can squeeze product out, and the lid is designed so well to make it virtually leakproof. I also like that it came with some labels for the bottles.

                "reviewText": "They are not horrible but there is room for improvement. Pros: Lightweight, Cute, Do not leak. Cons: As you get the bottom of the product, they just become mushy as you squeeze them and it's hard to get the product out, and my biggest pet peeve is they are a pain to clean. I will say that I like them and I will use them, they are just not my favorite.",
