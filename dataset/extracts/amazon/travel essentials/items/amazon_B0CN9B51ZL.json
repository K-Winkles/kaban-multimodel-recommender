Last year for a work conference I wanted to bring my self tanner and took every precaution I could think of - double zipper bagged it and then put it in a thick reusable grocery bag and when I got to my hotel I saw that the whole thing had exploded and ruined one of my favorite shirts. This year, I didn\u2019t want to take any chances so I gave these a shot. Still took all precautions and used 2 sleeves on one bottle, used the plastic liner that the product came in and put it in a zippered bag. This made it through 4 flights without a single drop on anything outside of the sleeves. As you can see the top sleeve eventually tore, but the rest still held up and kept the lid tight and secure. I used it on all of my other liquid products and they all made it through effortlessly without damage to the sleeve or the product. These are my new travel go to. Couldn\u2019t recommend them more!",

But for my 1-2oz bottles, I had to get thinner sleeves (search B0CGNTJM59 on Amazon). Too bad that return window for these ended since those thinner ones are stretchy enough and also work on the 3oz bottles.",
