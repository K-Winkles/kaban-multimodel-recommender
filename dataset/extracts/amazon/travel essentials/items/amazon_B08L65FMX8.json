                "reviewText": "I haven't used it but a few times, but seems to be a great product. I love the versatility of all the adjustments, and it folds up small. The remote is rather small, but it paired up quickly with my phone and works fine. One reviewer mentioned that the remote will not start and stop video, it does fine on my S21 Ultra. I also read complaints about short battery life of the remote. There is an on/off switch on the remote, always be sure to turn that off before putting it away. The tripod feature is a little wobbly, but not bad, I don't foresee any problem with the unit falling over by itself. The light is a really nice feature, it isn't extra bright, but does work well in closeups. At its price point, this product is hard to beat, six stars!",

I mainly got this to use as a small portable tripod and it is a little wobbly but usable for that. The only thing that is iffy is the phone grip, it does not open very wide and it is shallow. It holds my smaller phone fine but it is too shallow to hold my daughters phone with her pop it handle on the back, it would only work if we took the case off. I got it to use on my phone so it is good for me and I finally get to be in pictures with my family.",

I've had to position some braces along the legs to keep it in place.Overall, it works just fine for what you pay for it. I have no complaints",

If this is a gift for someone less tech savvy, you may need to set it up for them .The stand isn't the most stable at every angle, but it's usable and what I'd expect for the price I paid.It is a pain (literally) getting the foot to open, though. They show it's able to me pushed open with your finger, but it hurt a bit to do that on mine and I don't have fingernails. A pen does the trick for opening it, though.Also, it does mess with functions on my phone when Bluetooth is connected to the stick. E.g. my messages app wouldn't allow me to use my keyboard. Took me a few minutes to figure out it was the Bluetooth connection to the selfie stick that interfered with it",

The light is ok and a nice add compared to others that do not include one. The three legs open a bit hard. I sometimes feel as though I was going to break them. It also can easily fall over with the weight of the phone so just make sure to support it while adjusting phone angle. Overall it is a great item, especially at this cost.",

When folded up and not in use the hair band provides a way for me to secure it to a beltloop with a carabiner. I went back and bought 5 more for sharing with family and friends because I know there will be a lot of FOMO once I use it in front of them!",
