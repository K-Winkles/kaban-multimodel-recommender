Supple, velvety type cloth covering which will prevent irritation. Rounded, sturdy plastic parts which will not cause any scratches and boo-boo's. Stitching and assembly is high quality. The nylon braided is sturdy and attached well to the jack and headphones. And the headphones are very colorful making them easy to find when the kids misplace them. The make of these headphones exceeded my expectations in every way..Sound quality is pretty good. I put the headphones on myself. It captures a good range and has enough bass and treble where/when it matters. These headphones are not a toy when it comes to sound quality..There is no noise bleeding when the kids are using them. I do not let my kids blast the sound and make sure that sound never goes above 60 % of the max or so... But even with my kid 2 feet away listening to K-pop, I do not hear any noise bleeding at all..These headphones are adjustable and fit very well. Surprisingly ergonomically well designed. I tried them on, and they even fit my head without any discomfort. My kids use these headphones hours at a time continuously without complaining that their ears hurt or that the headphones are too tight..These headphones are sturdy... I have two pairs used by a six year old boy and an eight year old girl. The headphones have been thrown, sat on, swung around, pulled and plugged repeatedly, and picked at by kiddy fingers for months without any visible damage..These headphones are very simple to operate and do not come without any fancy bells and whistles like volume control and etc. But why would you want them in the first place? Complexity just adds to the potential for breakage when it comes to kids. You want headphones that work; that even a 6 year old can use; that can take a beating; and are well made, so that they last long. And these headphones fit the bill..One advice... Not for your older teenagers. The 13 year old is going to want something more expensive and \"cooler\" and not these... These are for up to grade 6 maybe.",

They are easy to adjust the sizing and easy to plug in and unplug. The quality of the material is ok, not the highest quality but given the price, still a great value.",
