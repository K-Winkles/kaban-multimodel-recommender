                "reviewText": "I purchased a mini travel steamer iron to keep my clothes neat while on the go. Firstly, its compact design is very convenient for portability, easily fitting into the suitcase without taking up much space. The heating speed is also fast, allowing me to start using it within a few minutes.This iron is straightforward to operate\u2014just add water and turn on the switch. The steaming effect is satisfactory, effectively removing wrinkles from clothes, making them look refreshed. It is especially suitable for handling compact clothing during travels.Despite its small size, the water tank capacity is sufficient for the needs of short-term travel. However, if frequent use or handling more clothes is required, it is advisable to use it moderately due to the limited water tank capacity.Overall, this Travel Steamer Iron for Clothes Mini is a practical travel companion, making it a good choice for travelers who need to keep their clothing tidy on the go.",

Not just to steam the dress before putting it on but also creating neat and flat pleats for the corseted top. If you are a designer, stylist, sewist of any sort YOU NEED THIS IRON! And if you aren't you still need this! Its nice and sleek, heats up quickly (im talking less than 20 seconds or quicker), the plate it sits on is perfect, its easy to store, clean and travel with. The handle turns to the side..I am obsessed and have so many people asking me about it. Very affordable and 10/10 will continue to recommend this for anyone.",
