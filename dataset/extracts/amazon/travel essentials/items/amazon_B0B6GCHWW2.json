                "reviewText": "I used this as a carry-on for a frontier flight and it fit perfectly. There is sooo much space in it. I was able to get about 6 days worth of clothes and essentials packed into it with no problem, which genuinely surprised me. It comes with packing cubes which really helped keep everything organized within the bag. It also came with a bag for shoes, which i love. Be careful not to overstuff it though, or it may not fit as a carry-on. The quality of this bag is superb. It held up so well for my trip! Not once did I worry about it falling apart or ripping. I love that it has the option to wear it as a backpack or to carry it duffel bag style with the handle on the side. The backpack straps can stow away inside a giant pocket when you dont need them which really helps save space. I love that there is a place to hook up your power bank inside and you're able to plug your charging cable into it on the outside. I honestly have no complaints with this bag. It served its purpose well and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy, reliable bag for their next trip. I did not test the water resistance but the bag itself does feel like it would hold up if you have to go out in the rain without it ruining all your belongings.",

They are durable, meet carry on standards (not a personal item) and very comfortable to wear. I was able to pack 6 light weight outfits and one pair of shoes. The bag is very large, about the size of a carry on with lots of pockets, compartments and smaller pack bags provided. We were all very pleased with our bags, and because of the functionality these can be used for weekends, overnights, etc. and not just for plane travel.",

                "reviewText": "My biggest concern before purchasing this item was if it was going to comply with the airline\u2019s personal item size requirements. I went searching online for 40 L backpacks to see if they did or did not meet the requirement, and found all sorts of mixed responses. I decided to take a gamble and see if I could get on board with the backpack - regardless of if the backpack satisfied personal item size requirements. The airport that I flew out of did not have a size checker and I got on board no problem. There was one at the arriving airport.The picture attached to this review is the backpack easily fitting inside the personal item size checker. However the bag is not completely filled to its limits either. This is with the extension zipper closed, the 4 side straps pulled tightly, and the bag not too overpacked. Inside the bag is a laptop and some electronics that go with that, five shirts, two pairs of pants, two pairs of shorts, some socks, toiletries, and one pair of shoes. Certainly enough to make it a few days, but not a whole lot extra on board. At this fill, it easily satisfied the personal item requirement. However, with the expansion zipper out, and the bag fully loaded it would not.As far as the bag itself, I am quite happy with it. I liked that the straps could be zipped inside of the bag so that it would look like a regular handled bag if I didn\u2019t want to go with the backpack look. I feel like it is well-made and should hold up for a while. The backpack straps are comfortable and I like that it had the front latch to hold the straps together. Compartments and zippers are generous. I have not mastered the packing cubes yet, but everything online indicates the packing cubes make life even better in a bag like this. That\u2019s for future experimentation.Happy with this bag. So much so that we are purchasing another one for my wife, who was jealous as I traveled. I will add just one more thing \u2013 this bag gets heavy as you load it up. I definitely missed having the weight on wheels as I went through the airport, but I also got away with no checked bag or carryon fees.",
