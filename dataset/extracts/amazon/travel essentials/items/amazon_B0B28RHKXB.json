As others mentioned, the hinges don't stay open on their own so you have to Macgyver a setup, but it's also an affordable product, so you're not getting all the luxe features. Great magnification, great lighting. My eyes are bad enough I used to have to wear magnifying glasses to pluck unwanted hairs, and still couldn't see everything because our bathroom lighting is terrible. This mirror takes care of that issue.",

Now I don\u2019t need the 10 x power that I did before, but it is still a great mirror. The light is very bright and recharges with USB cord included. I would recommend this mirror to others who have hard time seeing well enough to tweeze eyebrow hairs etc. well balanced and easy to handle. It comes in a soft pouch to keep it from getting scratched. Very beautiful classy looking item. I hope they have one I can purchase with less powerful magnification now. If they do, I\u2019m ordering another one!",

                "reviewText": "I never realized just how important this mirror was going to be until I tried putting makeup on in my Vegas hotel. Not only was the lighting horrible in the room, but the bathroom had even more miserable lighting! Thing is- the lighting in the casino is waaay better so any wrong color combo or shaky eyeliner lines WILL BE NOTICEABLE.So- get this mirror. The 3 light settings let you choose what works best for you. You can even just turn the mirror on and use the light with a larger makeup mirror (which, I also did in a pinch). My close vision sucks, so the 10x magnification is a godsend. Even better- the light automatically goes off when you shut the compact. It\u2019s a wee bit challenging to open as there\u2019s not a latch, and it\u2019s not as light as a regular compact mirror.Overall- worth the price. Highly recommend.",
