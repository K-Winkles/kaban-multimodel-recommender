                "reviewText": "Purchased for recent cruise. I've gone on two cruises previously. The first was spent nauseous the entire time. I didn't have any patches like these or medicine at all. Second time my doctor recommended patches and gave me a prescription strength patches. They were phenomenal. I wasn't sick the whole trip. Because those worked so well, I erroneously assumed over the counter patches would be sufficient. For a 7 day cruise, I spent the first 2.5 days miserable. Following the instructions, I had two patches on for my severe nausea. This gave me zero relief. My husband ended up going to guest services where they sent him with some meds to help.Perhaps it's just I'm overly sensitive but these absolutely did not work for me.",
