                "reviewText": "The material is actually soft but it definitely looks cheap. It also feels like it may not clean up that well, once it does in fact get dirty. Besides the fact that it's white; the material just has that feel to it, Idk..... Moving on, The zipper is a bit fiddly to open so well. Actually the lower compartment one is too I do like how the wire goes all the way around the top and opens it up more to make it easier to look what's inside. I appreciate that feature on a bag. ..... I wish they didn't put the little slogans right on the front of the bag. \"Be ur own queen\" isn't the cheesiest line out there~ I've seen worse on a few of this bags' competitors here in Amazon~ And the writing is in fairly small, gold font~ Personally I just think it would look better if it wasn't on there. But, could be worse. So- worth it for the price I paid (I think around $6) but only around this price point, not.much more. The bag holds a decent amount of product, and the bottom compartment does too (more than I expected). Overall, decent purchase but I'm not thrilled with it.",

I love how this makeup bag has a convenient metal frame at the zipper where it keeps it open. At the bottom, I like how the brush compartment has a plastic liner so that your bag can stay clean. More items can be added at the bottom as well.",
