                "reviewText": "The description says it has 6 pockets - the photo is more accurate. There is 1 \"pocket\" (main compartment) and an additional paper-thin bottomless front \"pocket.\"The elastic loop that holds the button seems fragile, but I've only had this a few days, so its durability remains to be seen.I have 10 ml bottles from Revive Essential Oils, and 5 of those just barely squeeze in. The base of the pocket is intended for narrower bottles, and while there is some give, it's awkward/difficult to get the bottles in and out. The pocket is taller than it needs to be for the 10 ml bottles, so I lay an additional bottle across the top.Aura Cacia 15 ml bottles don't fit in here, or they do, but very awkwardly since they are much wider than the base. You could probably squeeze 4 of those bottles in.",
