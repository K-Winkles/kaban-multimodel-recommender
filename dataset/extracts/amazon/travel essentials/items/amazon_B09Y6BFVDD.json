One is almost always enough because it\u2019s so large. The cleanser is neutral and it feels like I\u2019m cleaning with water. No overpowering scent and no soapy residue on my skin. These wipes get me feeling almost as good as my bidet at home. I couldn\u2019t live without them in my purse! I highly recommend!",
