This hair dryer does not make the bathroom hot and dried my hair in much less time than my old hairdryer. It is lightweight and folds nicely to save space. I love the deep emerald green color, the removable filter is a nice feature if you have ever tried to get the lint off an old school hairdryer with a toothpick, you will love this feature. Definitely recommend this hairdryer.",

It features a cool fan mode, low heat, and high heat. The filter cover at the back twists off for easy cleaning.Included is a simple diffuser. If I have one critique about this it would be that if using the diffuser on high heat it does get fairly hot itself. You may want to let it cool before removing the diffuser.",

As most everyone knows, hotel hair dryers aren't very powerful and my hair takes a long time to dry when I use them. Also, the ones at the hotels don't come with any different nozzles. This one comes with a styling nozzle, allows me to dry my hair much quicker, and it's so easy to travel with. The only thing I wish is that it has different heat/no heat options.",
