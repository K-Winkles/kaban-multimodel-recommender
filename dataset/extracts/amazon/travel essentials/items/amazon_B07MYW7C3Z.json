                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I needed something to use to hold my phone. I had snapped my last phone holder. I found this one. I carefully studied the photos and figured out it would be perfect for what I need. It says airline phone holder but this can clip to a desk, chair, small pole, really the possibilities are endless. The clip feels like it was made with a heavy spring, creating a strong grip. This will not fall off, even when bumped into, it continues to have a sturdy firm grip. The phone clip is adjustable and also has a good solid firm grip on my phone. If you have a pop socket, you can put the clip of the phone holder either above or below where you have your pop socket. Even though it's slightly off centered because of the phone being clipped different, this thing holds tight! I can think of ways to use it on long car rides. Just clip it to the headrest pole. Or inside the seat. It can also be used by itself as a phone stand to watch videos. I watch a lot of YouTube so I'm gonna try it out by itself. It's so crazy how strong the clip is. The material used to make the phone holder feels like a solid hard material, probably plastic, but very sturdy and does not feel easy to break. It does not wobble whatsoever. It appears and feels very durable.This twists 360\u00b0 at the elbow piece in the middle. You can adjust this item to any way you could possibly need. The elbow piece works like an elbow, and can only bend one way, but twisting the product around at the elbow should get you any angle you could possibly need. And, it can be folded away for easy storage. This will easily fit into a purse, bag or even pocket.I highly recommend this! Even if you don't fly, you can use it on car trips or even sitting at home. I just took a video (sorry that it's so dark, it's raining today) and used a planner book (because I'm on my phone) and showed the many different ways it twists and turns. It clips very nicely to my desk where I play my video games. I use this to hold my phone for easy access while gaming to look up how to do something in games. You can use it in the office, car, truck, anywhere that has a place to clip it. Highly recommended!",

Other than that it's still a very useful product and I would definitely recommend anybody use one especially if they're in their kitchen a lot it helps being able to watch your phone while you work. I'm very interested in the other products they offer and see what other innovative ideas they have.",

It definitely helped my neck and freed up my hands since it has a sturdy clamp and I was able to clamp it on firmly to the tray table while the table was in a locked position. It folds down into about a 3\"-4\" rectangle for easy packing too. Definitely great value for the price. Glad I purchased this to use during my travels!",

                "reviewText": "Die Handyhalterung wirkt beim Auspacken solide und macht einen wertigen Eindruck. Die Anleitung ist minimalistisch aber ausreichend, da das Produkt quasi selbsterkl\u00e4rend ist. Im geschlossenen Zustand ist die Halterung relativ kompakt und passt beispielsweise bequem in die Jackentasche.Beim Aufklappen des Halters f\u00e4llt auf, dass man viele Freiheitsgrade hat, um die Gelenke zu drehen und einzustellen. Dabei rasten die Gelenke an vorgegebenen Stellen und Winkeln ein. Die Abstufung der Winkel ist fein genug, um vielf\u00e4ltige Position zuzulassen. Gleichzeitig sorgt das Einrasten vor allem f\u00fcr Stabilit\u00e4t und einmal eingestellt bleibt der Halte in der gew\u00e4hlten Position. Selbst bei ausf\u00fchrlichem Tippen auf dem Touchscreen des Handys klappt die Halterung nicht weg oder \u00e4ndert ihre Neigung.Die Halterung ist darauf ausgelegt, an Tischen oder Kanten festgemacht zu werden. \u00dcber eine Klammer mit Spannfeder l\u00e4sst sich die Halterung an Tischplatten festklemmen. Dazu l\u00e4sst sich die Klammer problemlos bis ca. 2cm \u00f6ffnen. Laut Anleitung sollte die Halterung auch an Tischplatten mit bis zu 4 cm Dicke passen. Um dies zu erreichen muss man allerdings ordentlich Kraft aufbringen, um die Klammer so weit zu \u00f6ffnen. Andererseits sorgt die kr\u00e4ftige Feder aber auch daf\u00fcr, dass die Halterung stabil an der Tischkante sitzt.Die Halterung ist passend f\u00fcr aktuelle Smartphones. Getestet habe ich die Halterung mit einem iPhone XR, einem Pixel 6a und einem Samsung S8, jeweils mit und ohne Schutzh\u00fclle an den Ger\u00e4ten. Die Smartphones lie\u00dfen sich gut montieren und sa\u00dfen stabil in der Halterung.Nach etwa 4 Wochen in Benutzung haben sich keine gravierenden Schwachpunkte gezeigt und das Produkt liefert ein gutes Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis.",
