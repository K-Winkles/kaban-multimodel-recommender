I initially took out (unzipped - great feature!) some of the \u201cpages\u201d because me son was a little too small and I didn\u2019t want to lose all the Velcro pieces. We\u2019ve slowly added back in \u201cpages\u201d and it\u2019s almost transformed the book to a new book and grown with him. Love this book!",
