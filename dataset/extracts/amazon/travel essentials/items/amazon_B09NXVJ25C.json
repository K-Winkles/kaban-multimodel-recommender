I put eyeglass cleaner in one and my energy aura spray (which really smells lovely and really calms me) in the other. They pack easily in a purse, toiletry bag, backpack or carry on. The spray pattern is a nice even spray mist. Not sure how to clean them - perhaps you don\u2019t? What about when I want to use a different product? But figure they are so inexpensive that I can get others. Enjoy!",

I have a few perfumes that are not in spray bottles, so I thought this would be perfect, alas. I didn't feel like returning it so I decanted a bit of a perfume that *did* have a spray top, well, suffice to say that my entire room reeked of perfume the rest of the day. It did fill the gadget, but it also leaked almost the same amount it filled in the process. Maybe I did it wrong but in that case it's definitely not foolproof.",
