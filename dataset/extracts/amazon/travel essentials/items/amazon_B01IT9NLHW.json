Seeing these other reviews complaining about taste makes me laugh because I am a very picky eater but this taste good no problem. I use one package after I have sweat a lot or don\u2019t have enough hydration (after saunas, after hard cardio etc) also great for hangovers. Overall amazing product I bought a couple months ago and still have packages left in the bag to use. Will definitely buy again.",
