I am usually a side sleeper, so I felt that this style of pillow would bring me the most comfort. I was completely correct! One of the best parts about this pillow is that you can adjust the level of support. It was comfortable around my neck as a standard neck pillow, used to simulate side sleeping, and even as lumbar support. It was ready for use straight out of the bag with no strange packaging smell and it has stayed completely intact after going through the wash. I would highly recommend purchasing this neck pillow and I do not have any complaints or suggestions for improvements. It's perfect!",

                "reviewText": "First I have a short fat little neck and I don't like things around it, but for some reason this doesn't bother or make me feel claustrophobic. You can loosen and tighten to your comfort level, as well as turn the larger part to where you want more support. It is comfortable and supports the neck very well. The pillow itself comes with a snap so you can attach it to your luggage or whatever you're carrying . It also comes in a travel bag , which I think most people would prefer to keep it in and protected . I wish they would have put the snap on the travel bag as well. One can easily use the drawstrings to attach it wherever. Finally after going through a dozen travel pillows this is the one that I will be buying again and again. Great gift for the traveler in your life. Wish they had different colors but what they offer is sufficient for most. I highly recommend.",

This is by far the best, and only 1 I actually use and fall asleep with.(I gave it a four because I feel like there's always room for improvement with these types of things). Because It's adjustable, I'm able to shape it to my sleeping situation. It's super soft and has a snap on it, which can be used to Hook it to a bag while walking through the airport. It's also super squishy if you want to just smash it into a backpack. I actually fell asleep w it on my last flight- and I have a lot of probs getting comfy on planes. This helps. Would buy again.",
