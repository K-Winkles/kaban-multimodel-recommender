I bought two - one for each of my children - and it is the first time I haven't spent the entire plane flight constantly contorting myself to reach crayons/markers that have rolled off the tray table onto the floor of the plane. We used the clear zipper part to hold their small activity items (crayons, some paper, card games) and snacks, which was great because they each had their own and there wasn't any fighting over a larger bag of an item. They are also so easy to store since they roll up, and they wipe down super easily. I had multiple families on the flight ask where I got them. So glad I found them! You won't regret purchasing these!",

                "reviewText": "We bought this for a plane trip across the country and were very happy with the way it went over the tray table. The touch screen works when in the pouch. The main issue we had was that while there are openings for the headphone cable to go through the case, there wasn\u2019t room for the lightning cable to attach within the case. We did not end up using the tray but it seemed easy enough to use. The tray and case were easy to separate from each other.",

                "reviewText": "This made my flight with a 7 and 3 year old SUPER easy! I can fold the tray and easily fit it in my bag. It is soft and not bulky. My daughters were able to color without the crayons falling off the tray and had her snack without making a mess. Before this they would try to keep the tablet on the tray and constantly knocked it over and they couldn\u2019t have a snack and watch at the same time. Now I can attach it to the back of the seat and the tray is still accessible. I will never fly again without it. HIGHLY recommend this",

This was exactly what I needed to keep all of baby's little things organized during our long flight. You may have to remove the top part in order to close the tray table completely, but other than that, it was perfect. I also was able to loop straps attached to baby's toys, through the little loops on the bottom, to keep the toys from falling. I'm so glad I got this thing!",
