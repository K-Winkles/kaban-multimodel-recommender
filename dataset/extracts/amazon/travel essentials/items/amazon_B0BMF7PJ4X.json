                "reviewText": "I'm usually a very early adapter to new techie things, but they always seem to be the things that are on the OTHER end of the power cord. All these new fancy-dancy tech items plugged in to....my 20 year old, computer beige (now yellowing) clunky, thick, awkward to handle power strips. You know the ones. I had to rearrange a desk one day and started unplugging things. I stopped and pondered a bit gazing at its out-dated ugliness and immediately set myself on a mission to finally upgrade. I didn't even know what was out there currently, so to the internet I go to discover I've been living under a rock regarding advances in power strips.This one caught my eye immediately for its compactness. I saw others that were the \"tower\" type, but I wasn't looking for a tabletop version. This one lays nicely on the floor where power strip belong. The braided and flat 10 ft cord is beefy but not stiff, so it is very easy to manage, and the right angle flat plug is GREAT for tight spaces. What I appreciate the most is the amount of ports on this tiny little unit, eliminating the need to plug in power bricks to power my charging devices, and they charge FAST.When I search for products to purchase, I do not only look at ratings on the specific item, I dive in to the sellers other offerings and review those ratings. It appears this brand is highly rated for there quality, and there prices seem very reasonable for what you get.I have a few of the ancient power strips in my home, that will soon all be replaced with this brand.",

It holds 3 outlets and even has 4 USB ports, 2 of the slots for a type C port.It is high quality, durable and compact, so it doesn't take up much space either. Other than using it for traveling needs, this can also be used in the home or even in the office, making organization of so many wires hanging everywhere even easier.",
