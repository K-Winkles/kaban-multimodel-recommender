This is PERFECT for what I needed and will also be excellent for travel. The right side has a secure way to keep necklaces from tangling with a snap loop, center elastic and a small pouch at the bottom. There are 4 snap loops but was easily able to put in 6 necklaces by doubling up a few and it's fine. the center has a zippered pouch large enough for watches and bracelets or even bangles. The ring holder is perfect! the earring band will hold 3 pairs of smaller earrings or studs. and there is also another pouch that can hold bigger earrings and cocktail rings. The pink is a pretty pale pink and the metal zipper opens and closes very smoothly. Mama Like!!",

Only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is because there\u2019s not quite enough depth to it that earrings with a backing don\u2019t get squished. Case doesn\u2019t stay fully flat/in shape because of the bulge of earrings backing.",

                "reviewText": "Love how flat and light this case is! Won't take up a lot of space in luggage, which is just what I wanted. I chose the medium size in macaron green and really enjoy the light sage color. I think it's very attractive with the gold zipper accents, but of course that is personal preference.The key features that make this a great travel jewelry pouch are in the details. Sewn-in middle zip pocket for larger items, like a watch, bracelets can go in the side bag, which is buttoned and removable, snap closures for necklaces and rings, and a few earring slots. Th medium size stores just enough for you to pack a few accessories for a trip without being heavy or bulky!Despite what it says in the description, this is NOT leather. It's fake leather, but a pretty nice quality pebbled pleather. And overall it still has this cheap feel to it, but for a little over 10 dollars it's to be expected. The quality is quite nice for an inexpensive, well-designed jewelry holder. No loose threads, broken seams, or stuck zippers. Sometimes with cheap products the zippers are awful, but this zips smoothly. To be honest I don't expect it to last, but it serves its purpose and the cost to quality is fair. Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried lots of travel jewelry cases, but each one is just shy of good for me, either because of its shape, or the fact that it focuses on an item I don't need which is wasted space. This format is perfect - it accommodates necklaces, rings, and earrings in specific sections, but it can hold just about anything in the two pouches. It is flat rather than boxy, making it fit easily in travel bags. The outer material is a soft but durable, pebbled leathery material - the description says leather, but the price point, which is very good for even faux leather, says otherwise. The front and back are made with strong cardboard inserts, to protect the case contents. The outer zipper and inner snaps are made of a shiny metal, which is a nice contrast to the soft leather. All of the metal fixtures are strong and durable. The inside is lined with a very soft faux velvet, which is also used for the pouches and ring holder. The pouches are single lined, but the elastic pouch is doubled. The inside has nice details, like the matching leather on snaps, loops, and zipper pulls. The elastic on the necklace overflow pouch is strong. There could be just a tad bit more material on that pouch, to allow for a bit more bulk, but it is fine as is. I like the versatility of the items that snap in, allowing you to leave them out if you need more room for other items. I would like to see other colors in this style, as the green is a bit pastel-y for me, but I'm taking function over form here. This is very well designed, good use of space, great price. A+",
