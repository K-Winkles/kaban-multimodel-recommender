Not quite the quality of the ones I'll leave at home - but much more convenient.PROS:- Smaller brushes but still with nice handles that fit well in my hand- Very soft bristles- Nice case that doesn't waste any space, is compact - about 1\" x 4\" x 4\". Latches securely.- Nice variety of brushes- Bristles are secured well - I tried to pull some out and couldn'tCONS:- Synthetic bristles.... but pretty soft considering they're not \"real\". I'm willing to live with an average quality brush in exchange for the convenience while I travel.",

                "reviewText": "For about $10 this is a decent take along brush set that can be good for travel or keeping in a purse.It's not super high quality, but at least some of the brushes worked well for me.The brush they say is for blush seems stiff and harder, I tried using it to apply a little bit of bronzer and it was ok for that, I didn't feel it was good for blush.The brush that is for loose powder actually worked best for me all around, I used it to apply blush.I tried both of the small eye shadow brushes. I used the fluffier one for my medium shadow that I apply over a wider area, I had to go back for more shadow twice as often as usual, and I didn't feel the coverage was as smooth as usual. The one they call a smudge brush I used to apply darker shadow in the corners of the lids. It was going on very light, I decided to dampen the brush, and then it worked a lot better. I generally use three brushes for eyeshadow, I needed one for the highlight on the browbone, I had to wipe off the fluffier brush and use that.The eyebrow brush worked really well, I use brown eyeshadow on my brows because my brows are not thick, and that usually works best, it was really easy to get good coverage with the brush and easy to use.This comes in a plastic case with a mirror built in ( I wish it had a magnifying mirror too, instead of the window). The lid and bottom aren't quite lined up correctly, so I have to push in the bottom a little in order to get the lid to click closed.I like the compact size, definitely takes less space than my usual brushes do.",

Five brushes to take care of all your makeup needs, powder foundation, powder blush, eye shadow, blending, and eyebrows. The bristles are very soft and stay in place after use. The brushes fit perfectly in a small plastic case that has a window on one side so you can remember what's in it and a small mirror on the other side. The case cover swivels open and close and closely tightly with a snap. This is perfect for travel or for sitting on your vanity in its pretty case. I recommend this product.",

I was actually impressed with the feel and quality. I have often come across travel size makeup brushes that are cheap. You also get a flat brush which feels nice and firm! The set is perfect for touch ups; it is great for long or short trips. The brushes are gentle on my skin and definitely get the job done. The only reason I removed a star was because the built-in mirror is positioned in an awkward way though I understand why this is the case. I also had slight trouble while closing the case because the top part is uneven. Overall, I would still recommend this product! The case and brushes are so cute. I will be getting more colors and tell my friends who travel too.",

There are 5 brushes: 2 large for blush/powder and foundation, and 3 smaller brushes for eyes or lips. That's enough to cover all the bases when I'm away from home. The brush heads are thick and the bristles don't fall out. It's a good quality kit and I'm finding it handy.",
