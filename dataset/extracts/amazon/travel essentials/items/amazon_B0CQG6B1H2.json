Even the packaging was beautiful. 10/10 would reccomend.",

I bought the expensive one (brand name starts with a T) thinking it would be a better, more sturdy bag, better zipper, etc. Wrong. This one is actually better in a couple of areas: it has thicker, more sturdy plastic \"windows\", and the zipper is tighter and seems as good or smoother than the T one. The T brand does have cooler colors (more neutrals which make them look more $$) and you just have to decide if that is worth 4 or 5 times the price of this one. Yes, you read that right. Otherwise, they seem very similar in style, quality of material, size. They both could use a loop handle, however. Overall I am pleased with its size (will fit into a carry on) and love the look / style. And I love that there are windows on each side, allowing me to see eactly what's inside.",
