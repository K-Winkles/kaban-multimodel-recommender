                "reviewText": "This door lock is a pretty straightforward, simple solution to protect against kick-ins. The instructions are clear and just about anyone can engage the lock. It says it can withstand 500 pounds of forced, so that\u2019s pretty heavy duty. However, because of that, I have some concerns.I don\u2019t like the idea that I have to rely on the release mechanism always working and if that release button doesn\u2019t work, then I\u2019m left barricaded in the room. Can the fire dept apply more than 500lbs of force? I don\u2019t know. Because of that I would probably not use this unless I had a second fire escape route.While I don\u2019t know that it wouldn\u2019t work, I would still be cautious. I noticed that there are four small screws on one side of the mechanism, so potentially I could remove those screws to disengage the lock from the inside of the door. (I tried it.) That would be my back up plan if the button didn\u2019t work, but it means that I have to bring a screwdriver with me if I\u2019m traveling.Otherwise, I would be happy to have this, particularly if I was traveling alone.One thing that\u2019s important to note is that you MUST have at least an eighth of an inch gap between the door and the door frame to use this lock. It says on the packaging that if there isn\u2019t at least that much gap do not close the door. It doesn\u2019t say why you can\u2019t close the door, but it sounds like it may be a problem getting it open again if you do.",

                "reviewText": "It's seemingly built well and does help prevent accidental intrusion but I want to make it clear that this device likely will only deter or temporarily block someone from gaining access through the door it's placed on. Most household doors are wood and with enough kicking this thing will fall off the door as the handle and/or the frame of the door break. If you're using this on a metal door it would likely fare better but remember that it wont stop someone from coming through a window or other access point. I think it's important to share those thoughts up front as to not oversell the product as some miracle security device providing a false sense of security. If you generally just need added piece of mind that in normal situations someone can't accidentally enter your room then this is probably a good fit for you. Otherwise it's a bit chunky and not as compact as some of the others in the market but it does seem a bit better built as the trade off. Grab one as a gift for your traveling friend or family member or yourself and if you can get it on sale I think it'd be a good value. Stay safe out there!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried a few portable door locks for travel, but none have really been ideal.The popular ones with the triangular-ish thingee chained to a metal plate are a little bulky and tend to clang around in your bag.The rectangular block with a slide out bar thingee is more portable, but doesn\u2019t work on all doors/doorframes, and at least on the one I tried, the bar was a little narrow.This is silent to carry since there aren\u2019t any loose parts, and has the same limitations on not working on some doors/doorframes as most (all?) similar devices, but has two main concerns:1 - The pointy-ish metal bar sticks out about 5.25\u201c (pic), which is potentially dangerous for kids (or inebriated adults) running around.2 - While not sharp, it\u2019s still primarily a fairly hefty metal stake, which I\u2019m not 100% sure TSA would allow you to carry on a plane. The description says it\u2019s TSA-approved, but good luck arguing that to a grumpy agent.So, if you nor anyone you\u2019re staying with are likely to run into a doorknob, and you\u2019re not flying, it\u2019s a pretty decent deterrent.Packaging is tamper-evident, being a plastic clamshell surrounded by cardboard, so it\u2019s obvious if it\u2019s been used or not.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first time I've considered using an extra security/door measure as I moved into an up and coming neighborhood. I do have a lock and padlock, but I was hoping for something a bit more with this, the SABRE Universal Portable Door Lock with Travel Bag, Durable Travel Friendly Door Lock for Hinged Doors, Lightweight, Additional Security for Homes, Rentals, Apartments, Hotels & Commercial Buildings.Unfortunately for me, this is NOT actually truly a universal fit for doors. I tried for about 15 minutes to figure out how it would fit, then got a few more people involved, and the conclusion was that I did not have the proper space allotment to get this installed on my door. Apparently, per the manufacturer, you must have a 1/8 inch space gap for this to fit. I guess I have less than 1/8 inch space.The construction seems solid. It comes in a nice velvet-y pouch for storage/travel. Presumably the pouch will make sure the edges of the security device do not damage clothing and other items in your suitcase.The description also says it's TSA approved. I have no idea what would even NEED to be approved on this for TSA, but ok?Bottom line: didn't work for me at my home, where I REALLY need it, but I will hold on to this and take on solo trips for added security. HOPEFULLY it actually works in other doors than mine.",
