This pillow is a game changer. It is soft and comfortable yet very supportive. It works well for me whether I am in a window seat or an aisle seat. I can use my Airpods or over the ear noise canceling headphones without interference while using it. The back of the pillow is flat so it does not interfere with resting my head comfortably against the seat back. It wraps up nicely in the storage bag that comes with it. I appreciate that it is machine washable and maintains it fullness and support after washing. The construction and stitching is quite good and I am confident it will provide many years of use.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the BCOZZY Neck Pillow for Travel, and overall, I am satisfied with its performance. The design, offering double support to the head, neck, and chin, truly lives up to its promise, providing comfort and stability in various sleeping positions during flights, car rides, and at home. The large size ensures ample coverage, and the black color gives it a sleek and versatile look. The pillow's construction is comfortable, and the material feels soft against the skin. However, I did notice that the pillow can be a bit bulky, making it less convenient to carry during travel. Despite this drawback, the BCOZZY Neck Pillow delivers on its primary function of providing reliable support for a restful sleep, making it a decent choice for those in need of a comfortable travel companion.",

                "reviewText": "Needed to get something for my kiddo because he constantly falls asleep on long drives. I decided to try the BCOZZY travel pillow after seeing it get great reviews online. Here are my thoughts after using it for over a year.Pros:- Adjustable design allows you to customize the fit. The long velcro strip lets you tighten or loosen to your perfect size.- The fabric feels very soft and plush. It's comfortable against your skin.- It provides nice chin and head support. Head didn't flop forward when kiddo fell asleep.- Packs down nicely into the included bag. Compact for storing in carry-on.Cons:- Did not stand the test of time, became less supportive after several months of usage.- The neck hole is on the small side. It has to be pulled fairly tight on my neck to close with the velcro.- Can feel a bit tight/choking if cinched down too much. It's a delicate balance to find the right snugness.- The fabric, while soft, seems like it might get hot. More cooling material would have been better.Overall, I think the BCOZZY pillow is a decent option for travel but for the price and durability, I wouldn't recommend it. It's not perfect and it doesn't last. (Not that anything in life is or does, lol) The cushion isn't as sturdy after a few months of usage and after a year, it no longer supports my 6 years old neck. Will be looking for something else. Hope this review helped.",

The main thing I like about it is that the back part is flat. My old outdated pillow is too thick and it makes your neck uncomfortable when leaning against your chair. I also like the material, it\u2019s soft and comfortable. Because of the Velcro, you are able to make it looser or tighter, depending on your needs.Very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this travel pillow as I read a review (not on Amazon) which said that these pillows were the best type for people who find their head falling forward while sleeping on a plane. Well, that does describe me.I did find that I was able to sleep better using this pillow as the pillow prevented my head from falling forward as I slept, because when my head would fall forward I would wake up.The pillow is comfortable and squishes well into it's included travel pouch. The pillow and pouch also have handy loops with snaps to attach to your luggage as you go through the airports, which I found helpful. The snaps are sufficiently strong enough so that they don't easily open, but are not too strong that they are difficult to open.Also, the pillow is not less bulky than a traditional neck pillow when the pillow is stored away in the pouch.The pillow can be used in other positions as well, like side sleeping. I don't sleep that way so I cannot comment on the effectiveness.One minor complaint is that the pillow is high enough on my neck to interfere with my noise cancelling headphone, by pushing the headphones up a bit. The interference may be due to my size, as I'm small, or because my headphones are bulky. The headphones are over the ear headphones and are fairly old, so newer models may not have the same problem.",

Soft and supportive. Just to note that I also tried this in conjunction with the one that goes around the seat to hold your head in place but it was too much faff to use both together so I just used this one. Add in your eye mask, ear plugs, noise cancelling headphones and you'll get the best sleep available on a noisy plane.",
