Whoever thought of thaws is so smart. They are so perfect! I can put my curling irons or flat irons away with the rest of my stuff with peace of mind. I also like to use them when I am travelling and need to flat iron hair real quickly and then put it back into my bag and not worry about it melting or burning my bag. Very good price too",
