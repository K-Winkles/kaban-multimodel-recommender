I wanted something affordable (they\u2019ll eventually lose/break it) and compact (for their backpacks). The case was a bonus! I think that these are a great quality for the price. My only complaint (take as a grain of salt given their age) is that they can be hard for the little ones to push all the way open to lock and difficult for them to close. I or older sisters have to assist the two youngest, but otherwise these are fantastic. They zip them up into their case and store them in the side pouches of their backpacks.I would highly recommend this for purses, diaper bags, backpacks, etc for a just in case.For reference- it\u2019s been four months and they haven\u2019t broken or lost them yet\u2026 this is a mom win!",

The automatic mechanism makes it incredibly easy to open and close with just the push of a button. Even though it is small, it offers surprisingly good coverage in light to moderate rain. It has saved me from getting wet on multiple occasions. I haven't tested it in heavy downpours yet, but for regular use, it is absolutely perfect. I love how stylish and trendy it looks too. Overall, this small purple umbrella in case gets a solid 5 out of 5 rating from me",
