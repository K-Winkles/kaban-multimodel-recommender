                "reviewText": "These do not seem like the most durable devices, but for the price I think it is spot on. It worked perfectly on the tray table on one flight, but the return flight had thinner tray tables and this did not clamp closed enough to create tension to hold in place. I was able to stick my external battery against the tray table and clamp it around both so it became snug enough. An adapter piece or foam block included would be great for this problem and as long as a person handles with reasonable care, should last quite a while. It\u2019s great that it folds up so compact and easy to store away after the flight. It could easily work in other areas and modes of transportation too.",
