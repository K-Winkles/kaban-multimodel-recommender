When the bag is open, it's great, it's folded out flat and everything is easy to get to. The problem arises when you actually need to close it, the two sides essentially end up angled at 45\u00b0 when the bag is sitting level. Depending on what you have in the bag, that may or may not be okay. I'd rather have a standard bag that I don't have to worry about what is packed in it, or how it's placed. I also believe it's overpriced for what you get, in comparison to other bags of similar quality.",

It's also surprisingly slippery. This would be a much better product if the leather had some grip on it. The pros of this bag is that it looks very professional, and has plenty of space inside. Because of how difficult it is to maneuver, I don't see myself using it much, but it might be the right fit for somebody out there.",
