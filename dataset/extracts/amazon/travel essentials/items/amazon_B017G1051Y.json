We went into the jungles a lot & let me tell you.. the mosquitoes are big & annoying! This product in combination to the Repel Plant-Based Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent Spray - its a win win! I barely had any bites & if I did I would spray the bite w/ the repel spray - no itching was involved!! Some people had massive welts from the mosquito bites & am I thankful there was multi pack because people were asking for them. I was there for 10 days & wore on both my ankles.. I changed them the moment the scent (very light) was not able to be smelled which on average was 3-4 days. Its not perfect but I was soooo happy I bought this so I am not going to take stars away!",
