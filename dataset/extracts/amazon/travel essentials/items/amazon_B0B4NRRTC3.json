                "reviewText": "I love having my electronics stored correctly, especially on the go! I bought this for traveling and now love to have it at home always ready to go for next time! I was able to fit a thin portable charger in it as well once it was all packed up! I really enjoy the texture and fabrics used. It is a soft shell bag, not hard, the zippers are noticeablely nice to use to zip open or closed and a snug fit for everything.",
