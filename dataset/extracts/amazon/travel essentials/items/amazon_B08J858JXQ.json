I\u2019m getting ready to have my teeth straightened with Invisalign so I have started getting into the habit of water flossing again and brushing after every meal. I love this little gadget. I put it in my purse and take it to work with me. I also use it at home because it\u2019s my only water flosser. There are 3 settings from soft to soft pulse to hard. The highest setting is pretty intense and hard. The lower two settings are too weak for me. The highest setting will take every little piece of stuck food out but it\u2019s a tad too hard. There is enough water in the container to go around your teeth twice completely if you move quickly. Once around does a good job. I use it 2 to 3 times a day. It is rechargeable and the charge will last at least 3 days, maybe even more. The plastic water container comes off for cleaning, you just need to give it a good tug because it\u2019s on tight. There\u2019s no other maintenance required. Simple, portable and does a good job.",

I love it for travelling, as it fits easily with other toiletries and has been very reliable. I have crowns and an implant, so I really need to use it every night to remove food debris. The battery lasts a long time, and charging with a USB cord is easy. The water capacity is limited by it's small size, so I usually have to refill it and use a second tankful to feel like I've completely cleaned my teeth. On my unit, the nozzle was very difficult to remove at first; I had to grip it with my teeth to remove it from the unit for storage, but that got better over the months. It worked perfectly for 18 months, but it then suddenly stopped working. I need to call customer service to",

                "reviewText": "I love this! It\u2019s super compact and quite powerful - so much easier to use than the bigger water flosser types you can buy! I am using this every day with no problems - I think the size is enough for water and have not had any concerns. It\u2019s not heavy and comes with optional heads. My only gripe is the \u201ccarry case\u201d - not worth it - it needs a heavier case if you ask me but don\u2019t let this stop you - very worth it if you don\u2019t have counter space / travel / easy to fit on handbag if taking to work etc. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I've only had the chance to use it twice, but it seems to be working great. I love how compact it is so I don't have to have yet another thing sitting on my bathroom countertop. It charged up fast, and was super easy to use.The tank part comes off so I'll be able to keep that clean, which is great.One thing that annoyed me, is that while testing the peridontal jet tip for the first time, the little plastic spout at the end came off completely. It doesn't seem possible to reattach it so either the one I received was damaged or they're just poorly made and not able to handle the force of the jet stream.If this thing lasts, it's a 5 star product, however, I'm deducting 2 stars for the unusable jet attachment and giving them a chance to make it right, after which I'll update my rating.",

So I took a chance on this little water flosser and am very impressed. It is easy to maneuver in your mouth, comes with tips suitable for people with braces, puts out lots of pressure and is adjustable.I've been using it for a few weeks and each time I do, I feel like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned. I tried it on some soap residue around the drain pipe on my sink and it lifted it easily - so I imagine that it is doing exactly the same for plaque on your teeth.This product is well worth the price IMHO.",
