                "reviewText": "Update Mar 2020: These went along on our spring break cruise this year (yes, we were the LAST passengers on our ship before all cruises were halted due to COVID!) and they were terrific. So worth bringing along! They will be going camping with us this summer as the campsite we're staying at has a pool and the kids will be swimming, I'm sure!I don't like to schlep extra stuff and I've always gotten by with the number of hangers in the cruise cabin closet by hanging things on top of other things. (Plus if there aren't many I know I can ask for more.) But I was swayed to try these by the idea of drying swim suits and the fact that you could \"trap\" the straps and they wouldn't blow off the hanger! I brought them on our cruise and am so glad I spared the luggage space for these!Pros:~ Super light-weight and fold down small~ They were really sturdy - I hung a pretty heavy sweater on one and it was fine~ Work really well for adult and children's clothes~ You can \"trap\" straps in them for drying, even in the wind!Cons:~ ??? I'm not sure - I loved them!Wish I'd have taken a picture of our swim suits drying on our balcony - we just hooked the hanger over the back of our chairs and they stayed put. (I had an elastic clothes line with clips on our last cruise that I really liked but we packed it away for the winter in our boat so didn't have access to it. I was in a bit of a panic but realized I could use these. I'm glad - these gave the flexibility of extra hangers in the closet AND drying things on the balcony or in the bathroom so they'd be my choice over the heavier clothesline with built in clips for future travel.)",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for traveling around Europe and am so glad I did - they came in handy on multiple occasions! Especially after washing clothes and hanging a few items to dry. The places we stayed only would have a few hangers if any, and I wear dresses mostly so it was great to be able to hang them up. They\u2019re also nice and sturdy and unfold to a good size. I might even use them as regular hangers when not traveling! (This was in the spring/summer - not sure how they\u2019d fare with heavier items but probably fine).Highly recommend! Only drawback is they take up a little bit of space, not too much but probably more than other options out there because these are sturdier. They\u2019re still pretty light, fold up well and are definitely worth it! I\u2019m taking them with me on future travels for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I only go on vacation to tropical places thus very warm weather with me sweating a lot and changing my shirts a lot. No matter how many hangers I get in my room I need more so I looked up travel hangers, saw these and ordered them asap. They are everything I wanted. First I wanted them to work but take up little space. All 12 of these fold up and can slide easily into any zippered pocket with a carry on with no issue of possibly being damaged and shockingly take up so little space. They open up to the size of an ideal hanger. yes they are slightly fragile but that is to be expected with them also being made for size. Be careful with them and they will indeed be sturdy and durable. I gently place a shirt on a hanger heavy with sweat and the hanger works perfectly. I think they could handle heavier winter clothes as well as long as you are careful when placing the item on. I am thrilled with these and now I have 12 extra hangers on every trip I go on. Beyond thrilled and highly recommend.",
