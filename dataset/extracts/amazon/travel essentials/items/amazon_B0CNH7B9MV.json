The silicone bottle brush and shaped nipple brush work very well, and being made of silicone that stays cleaner and is boilable is a great idea. The straw brush is also good for cleaning standard anti-colic bottle parts. The travel case is a good size for packing into a diaper bag. I do not think all breast pump parts would fit in this small container (at least the ones my daughter has will not). Neither of us has tried the small soap dispenser yet. I would recommend this very nice, portable set.",

                "reviewText": "This is the perfect little travel set. It opens and closes smoothly, it\u2019s not too large, it\u2019s light weight and they have cool colors. I love that it can all go into the dishwasher! We haven\u2019t done that yet but anything that can go in the dishwasher is great, a life saver one might say. The bottle drying rack that lifts up from the inner cover lifts up and goes back down easily.It comes with all you really need! Different brushes for different bottle parts and a soap dispenser! The bottle brush stores in two pieces, I was afraid it would be tough to get undone to close it all back up but I have to say I am impressed. No issues so far and I don\u2019t foresee any!",

When I don\u2019t have a litter, I have found it is also good for drying silicone zip top baggies. While I don\u2019t travel with a litter of kittens, the compact nature of a travel item means it stores any nicely till the next kitten season.",
