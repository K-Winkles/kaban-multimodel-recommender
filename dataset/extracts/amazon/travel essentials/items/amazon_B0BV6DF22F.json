                "reviewText": "I looked around online for a waterproof case and I'm glad I got this one. No regrets at all!This case worked very well and kept my phone dry during our 3 day lake trip. It's 100% waterproof and floatable as in the ad. I swam with the phone and put the phone upside down in the water and not a single drop came inside the case.The photos and videos are very clear and beautiful as if there was no cover on the phone. The case doesn't bother scrolling and swiping either. So I just kept the phone in the case all day except while it was being charged.The water would block the touchscreen so I started the video above the water and submerged the phone in the water to take images underwater.When I placed the phone in the case, I made sure 1. To remove as much air as possible from between the phone and the case, 2. There is no wrinkles or sand etc on the case especially around the opening, 3. To press the plastic pieces firmly and lock the case. It takes only 15 seconds!!I'm so happy I can finally take photos and videos in the water without a fear of getting my phone wet and broken. I would recommend this and would buy this again!",

                "reviewText": "I am sooo amazed by this ! I thought there could be a chance of water getting in to some extent but it really stayed dry throughout my Cancun vacation!!! Beaches, cenotes, swimming pool- took them everywhere and my 11 yr old son was able to use it independantly too! Had a bad experience with another brand that I cannot even remember now but this product is great quality! The straps are strong, plastic is thick , roomy for large phones too and its easy to seal ur phone in! Ooh I was also texting my husband while in the pool without needing to open the case (like one liners not too long though) LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! One of my best Amazon purchases (I have had bad luck on so many !)",
