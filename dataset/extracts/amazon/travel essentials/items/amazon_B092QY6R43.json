I was able to put the fan around my neck on speed 1 most of the time and that was enough to help me tolerate the heat and humidity. It was not overly heavy around my neck and the charge lasted a decent amount of time. It did not take overly long to recharge. The only negative thing is you need to use the cable that came with it to charge it; we tried other cables we already had with us and they did not work. I was very happy with the performance of this fan.",

We spent about 8 hours at Disney and it lasted the whole time there.It\u2019s easy to use, not super loud like some other fans, it does keep you cool but you have to move it around you seeing as it\u2019s more of a straight shot vs a broad band kind of thingy. The straps adjustable so you can choose where to hang at plus there\u2019s a clip. It\u2019s easy to carry around with you and light weight.",

It stands, clips onto something, or has a neck strap that removes easily. It recharges quickly and works while it recharges, with an easy-to-read display and a light that indicates charging status. It is also nicely finished and actually pretty. The air intake is on the top, so it does not get blocked by fabric, etc. It puts out a lot of air on even the lowest setting and is quiet. I can direct it just on my neck and not my face, so it does not dry out my eyes. So glad to have this. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a lanyard fan for my recent vacation that worked for the week while I was there but once the battery died, so did the fan because it wouldn\u2019t charge anymore. The fan I had looked like most all of the other fans you see that blow straight out. I wanted to replace the fan that quit working and came across this one. I had never seen one that blows straight up like this one does. If you are going to use it with the lanyard, this makes so much more sense! I no longer have to lift the fan up towards me, this one blows right where I want it. If you decide to use it without the lanyard, it has a stand attached to the back so you don\u2019t have to prop it up against something. Also a really nice bonus is that it has a battery indicator so you know when it\u2019s getting close to needing a recharge! I\u2019m actually so glad my other fan broke or I would never have found this one. I absolutely love this little fan!",

It takes about 2 1/2 hours to fully charge.I\u2019ve debated about whether or not I should return it but\u2026 it technically does the job, this is just not for long term use. Other than the battery life I have no complaints.",

                "reviewText": "Terrible pic, but I love this thing. This little fan is perfect for my needs. I've had it for over 2 months now, and it works great. My body temperature flip flops between frosty-bones cold and egg-sizzling-on-the-sidewalk hot frequently, so swapping the home AC around to accommodate me would be a nightmare.This summer has also been particularly painful. When I first got it, I would turn the fan on when my AC wasn't working and have it blowing right in my face. I thought the fan wasn't doing much until I turned it off and realized the raw air was hot-pepper-spicy-satan-hot. I would then turn it back on and bask in the feeling of the fan.Sometimes I have to turn it off because it makes me cold, but keep in mind that it's not a mini AC. It will not serve you Arctic Frost unless the room temperature is already slightly cool or you're anemic idk.Occasionally, I fall asleep with it on and that has given me some of the best sleep I've had in a bit. It's usually dead by the time I wake up, but the battery lasts if you're not using it on the highest setting. I rarely have to turn it higher than the second setting, though.Oh, and you can use it while it's charging. That part has been a huge lifesaver. I didn't realize it at first, but I tried it out one day when I was desperate to get away from the summer heat, and it works just the same as if it was unplugged. I've used it while charging even if it was just completely dead a second before with no issues. I wouldn't use the fan before it's charged too much, as it could mess up the device in the long run. But if you really need it, this little trick could help you out.",
