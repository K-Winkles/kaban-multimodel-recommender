I put the trash down to clip it, then closed the tray back up. Simple. You do need to bed mindful of others in front of you as a lot of movement will disturb them. Be kind. I do agree with others that having something soft for between the feet may help bone on bone contact from feet. Otherwise it helped my back tremendously. Those that say there wasn't any adjustable clip or it was too short may have missed it not received the connector strap. Happy purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Works great - just need to remember to remove your legs from sling when you put your food tray down or it will come down with lots of force. It attaches easily to the tray and can be adjusted as needed throughout your flight. I enjoyed swinging my legs even just a little to help with circulation. You do need to move your feet around a bit to keep them from getting sore pushed up against each other. I would put a piece of clothing or thin blanket btwn your feet to add a bit of cushioning. Great product - highly recommend trying it.",
