At home, I use a Proper Pillow nightly, and am a side and stomach sleeper. and wanted to find something travel size that wouldn\u2019t be too high in loft but still supportive, and could be rolled and packed in a carry on for air travel. It\u2019s a little lower in loft than my regular pillow, and the perfect side. It\u2019s perfect for back sleepers - I would give it 5 stars if that applied to me. It\u2019s a little softer in support than I am used to, but if I sleep only on my stomach it is perfect and doesn\u2019t hurt my neck. It rolls up in the travel bag it comes with, which is just what I wanted. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with it for the price point and the purpose for which I bought it.",

I've found all memory foam has a smell initially and this pillow was no exception. I had to air it out for a couple of months before I could use it but that's normal for me - I'm very sensitive to chemical smells in furniture, clothing, bedding, etc.",

                "reviewText": "I have some hip pain and was told to try sleeping with a pillow between my knees. The bow shaped one made my knees hurt and it forces you to sleep with your legs exactly stacked. A regular pillow is too big, needs regular adjustments, and hard to turn over with. This one solves all those issues and it's helping my hip pain. I'm sure I'll sleep better when traveling with this pillow, too! Since it compresses, I might even get another because hotel pillows always suck.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something small to use along with my large sleeping pillows. Sometimes you just need a little more of 'something' to lean your head or neck on. I currently use travel U-shape pillows to add a little extra support and comfort however, that wasn't doing it for me. I decided to try this little memory foam/rectangle shape pillow. BINGO! This is perfect for my needs. I love how it easily molds as needed, or springs back to its original shape. Here is the bonus for me - the small bag it comes with serves as an excellent carryon when flying. It has a strap on the carrying case to adhere to your carry-on luggage. very handy. I typically get a window seat so this pillow should work perfectly against the wall of the plane. The U-shaped travel pillows don't work for that. Excellent price too!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a few different pillows because my partner and I like different pillows, and I was immediately envious of her choice of this pillow.I was skeptical that the foam would inflate really thin, or lose shape quickly, or any number of things, but none of those problems are here.This pillow is oh so soft, it's cliche, but it's pretty much like putting your cheek on a cloud. To put a fine point on it, it really is just as good as my feather down pillow at home.It's wide for a camping pillow, so you can turn and still be on it. It's the right thickness for a wide-shouldered side sleeper like myself. It doesn't overheat my head or ear. It packs up smaller than my other backpacking pillows. It's lighter than one of my other backpacking pillows. It didn't take all day to self-inflate, maybe 10 minutes or half an hour to max it out. The stuff pack it comes with is tight, but nice and small and seems respectable quality.Look, if you want a backpacking pillow and still want to actually be comfortable like me, spend the roughly 5 dollars more and carry the extra 2 ounces of weight, I promise you will be glad to be rid of the money and carry the weight. You'll know as soon as it arrives this thing rocks.",
