The size is perfect: it's easy and not too heavy to hold in your hand, it sits neatly next to a phone, or on a desk, without taking up too much space, and/or it is sturdy and large enough to use on your lap; yet it has plenty of space and options for keeping track of everything required in every day. It includes spaces for the days' priorities, things to remember, and even highlights for the next day. The spaces are large enough to easily see everything in all the organizational areas. I have never before seen a pad like this, with all those features on a to-do list; and I just love it and am so glad I came across it. It is the beautiful and easy help I needed for organizing my days and time, I call that Perfect.",

I have used it around the garden to keep track of work, and it has held up well to water drips and dirt smudges. Great for flipping between the pages, I have a few project lists on different pages, so am flipping back and forth as my day progresses and the paper around the spiral has not ripped or torn. I appreciate the size, as I like to write my lists in large easy to read print. Nice note book!",

There is also room for the date, priorities, things for the future, and extra notes. I like this because it's meant for a single day. Pages are decently thick. My biggest annoyance is that it advertises that you can tear off the pages. And though you can, you won't want to because the tear looks bad. I don't like that ripping is straight off the rings, as it leaves it very frayed. I would much prefer a perforated line to tear off.Currently on sale for $11.99. The price seems find depending on how much you use it. Might be too much if you need a new one every month. I feel it's the kind of thing that could be $5. But if you only need one notepad a year, and love the set up, then it's a good deal for you.",
