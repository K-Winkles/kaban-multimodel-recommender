I use it primarily with my phone, but also found that it holds my Nintendo Switch perfectly when using the controllers separately. Great for hands-free viewing such as video calls. Phone can be put on the stand in upright or sideways position. It has a small footprint and is designed for ease during charging. The hole in the back helps to corral the cord, and the design allows ample space for plugging into the bottom of the phone. All in all, a great little stand at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "Definitely the best smartphone stand I have bought till date on Amazon. Bought it after I had already purchased a similar product from the same seller for my tablet. I bought it in a lightning deal with a small discount, but even without the discount it would have been a great deal for the price. The stand itself is very well designed, the metallic body is light, compact and sturdy. It looks great on my home office desk and I plan to get atleast a couple more for my work. The extra pads that the manufacturer sent with the package are a plus. But with a few days of heavy use, I can already confirm that there is no slippage and it takes the weight of my iPhone 7 really well. I have tried it with a few other smartphone models and it shows the same stability with all of them. The only design enhancement, albeit a really small one, that I would suggest for a future model would be to allow more room on either side of the arm that holds the phone so that the phone can be placed on it with the headphones in the socket. It is not an inconvenience though, the phone just has to sit a little bit to the left in that case. All in all, I am extremely pleased and would highly recommend.",
