I love that I can separate different brands/types of pens and markers from each other keeping everything looking clean and organized. I just really love how it looks, it makes it inviting to grab a writing utensil if that makes any sense. It is a good size, I\u2019m able to fit plenty of items in it. The white finish with the little gold feet are stylish. I love how it rotates too so you can easily browse all the options in the holder. It is plastic, not necessarily the best material, but that doesn\u2019t bother me. I bought this for my office and ended up buying another for my home. Highly recommend!",

No more scattered pens across my desk or searching for that favorite pen hidden at the back of a drawer somewhere. This little organizer isn't only cute, but functional and has helped me clear up some clutter from my desk. It rotates fairly smoothly allowing ease of access to all the compartments, and for something that doesn't take up too much space, I'm surprised by how much it can hold! I was easily able to fit a couple dozen pens and highlights in, as well as full sized scissors, envelope opener, staple remover, tape, and more! Going to buy another one for my makeup brushes next!",
