                "reviewText": "I like that it screws into the outlet so that you do not have it pulling out when you try to unplug something. Has USB and USB C. It is very sturdy and looks good. The only thing I don't like is that this is using only one plug on the wall outlet to run all of this. I guess it doesn't matter for most things that you plug in but I would be careful what you plug into it. It is possible to overload it. But for low voltage devices it shouldn't be a problem. It has a green indicator light that lets you know it is working. Great for plugging in multiple things into a single outlet. It does have a surge protector. So far have not tripped it. A good deal. Better than expected.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought a number of outlet expanders over the years and the early ones were terrible. Big, bulky, ugly and only added an extra outlet spot or 2.The QINLIANF 5 Outlet Extender is much more advanced, attractive and powerful than any other I have tried. It adds 3 additional full outlets to any plug, as well as 3 USB outlets and one USB-C outlet. Admittedly, I have not used the USB-C outlet yet, but I have chargers and cords plugged into pretty much all of the other outlets including an Amazon Echo, chargers for a tablet, iPad, cell phone and portable speaker.It can be installed permanently by using the middle screw to anchor it to the outlet (once the faceplate has been removed, an extremely easy DIY project) or simply plugged in like any other device and then removed and moved around if needed.Honestly, when I bought it, I didn't realize that is also has a built in surge protector. I haven't had use for it yet, thankfullly, but it's nice to know it's there standing guard for me. There is a green light in the middle, although I don't know what its function is. Perhaps something to do with the surge protector.Overall, it is a great outlet extender and I will be buying several more for around the house, since, with a family of 5, there are endless devices and chargers that need plugging in.",

                "reviewText": "The reason why that I say it is \"odd\" is because it won't just plug into your outlet - there is some kind of plastic stud (?) that sticks up and must be broken off before it'll plug in; it broke off with a little bit of effort but not so much that I would consider it hard to remove. And once you get it plugged in and lock it down (with the long screw that comes in the box) that's in the middle it's tight to the wall, secure and it works great. We all love it!And it's really awesome that you have multiple USB ports on it so that you can charge your phones or whatever else or just plug in your phone or whatever to play sooner music while you're doing dishes or cleaning and then you don't have to worry about the batteries draining down (and it will obviously charge your phone or whatever while you have it plugged in playing the music). The plug outlets are arranged in a great pattern too, easy to use formatting.",

                "reviewText": "So, this surge protector and power strip has a lot of protection when it comes to surge protection! At the top end of what you will find for general electronics, this one has 1680 joules of protection before it gets fried to save everything thats plugged into it. If you have any high end gaming computers, REALLY expensive electronics, you would purchase an expensive/entire next level surge protector having over 2000 (2K) joules of protection. So this surge protector packs a punch for all regular electronics, regular computer equipment.The lit up center green button shows that the surge protection is still working and has not been fried by a lightening hit or something. If it does one day get fried, this whole unit will still work as a power strip but would no longer provide the surge protection for the devices plugged into it.I mounted this charger and plugged in some \"hard to plug in\" electrical cords and this thing held sturdy! I was impressed at how sturdy it was when I had to really give an extra push or pull to some of my plugs going into or pulling out of it.Each of the three USB A (same as saying USB) port is 12 Watts. This matches the highest capacity of most USB A cords, so this is good. It also is great that EACH USB A port has this capacity, so plugging in multiple devices into these ports will not create a slow down on the others, which is great!The one USB C port is 15 Watts but not a fast charging port. So it may take 56 minutes to charge the same as what a fast charger would take 34 minutes, as an accurate example. I am fine with that.. But good to be aware that this will not charge as fast as a \"fast charger\" if you have one of those elsewhere in the house. And if you do, you could always plug that fast charger into one of the traditional outlets on this power strip and achieve your fast charging effect that way!The traditional electrical ports are well spaced and VERY handy.The price is GREAT! A GREAT bargain!This purchase is an excellent one!",
