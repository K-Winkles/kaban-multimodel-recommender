App has customizable what's settings as well.Sound quality is great, especially at this price point! (not sure about the noise cancelling features as I haven't been anywhere especially noisy to test this feature yet)The included manuals have both written and visual instructions and are easy to understand and follow.All buttons and functions are easily found and work well.Comes with both type c charging and 3.5mm headphone Jack cables.Will update later after some use, but so far, I'm very happy with my purchase, especially since similar headphones I was considering were hundreds more$$$. TOZO is a great value for your money!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the headphones for the last 10 days now and I'm really in love with it. I didn't expect that I'd like the over-the-ear headphones so much therefore I feel like it's an obligation to write a few points about it.1. Sleek design and great packaging reminds me of unboxing Apple products. The look, the texture everything feels premium quality and workmanship worthy giving it as a gift to your loved one.2. USB-C charging. Great battery life.3. Super easy to pair with multiple devices.4. Easy to use buttons to control volume, on/off and skip track.5. Plush and comfortable ear cups, easily adjustable design makes it easy to keep it on for hours.6. Microphone works great for making phone calls and veritual meetings.7. Great active noise cancellation feature and it made me realize how much the background noise is in even an empty office.8. And the best one for the last is the crisp sound quality. It exceeded my expectations by some margin. Premium sound quality.Overall, it's a great product. Kinda surprising a headphones of this quality can be 40-odd dollars. I'm very happy with my purchase and definitely and confidently recommend the HT2 over-the-ear headphones if you are considering buying ones.",

I can really hear all the details in my favorite songs. I've also used them to watch movies, and the sound is just as good.ComfortThe headphones are very comfortable to wear. The earcups are soft and padded, and they fit snugly over my ears without being too tight. I can wear them for hours at a time without any problems.DurabilityThe headphones seem to be very well-made.

                "reviewText": "I have been a Tozo customer for a few years now and have used almost the full range of their products so I've become quite accustomed to the high level of performance and quality for the price. The Tozo HT2's continue the legacy of offering a well-designed, high-performing product for a very reasonable price. The sound quality I believe is on par with the \"Gold\" ear buds which is to say very good. The ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) modes work well and there are more options available if you use the Tozo app. One small gripe is the Tozo app can have troubles connecting to the headphones and I have had similar issues connecting to the Tozo bluetooth speakers and ear buds as well. But once connected there are a lot of options available for equalizer (including fully custom), and ANC on products equipped with that feature (including the HT2s). Back to the HT2s, the battery life is incredible. I used mine on a 4.5 hour flight at high volume and the battery only dropped by 20% over that time...impressive indeed. The muff design of the headphones is very comfortable and soft and is a sort of faux-leather material. I have relatively large earlobes and the muffs are big enough to cover fully outside of the lobe which is important for long-wear comfort. The controls are all on the right side muff (and the headphones are clearly labeled \"L\" and \"R\" inside of the muffs on the speaker covers). It does take a bit of getting used to feeling where the buttons are and which one does what but not bad. My only suggestion here would be to move the volume out to a spinning dial on the perimeter of the outside of the speaker body rather than having the small buttons for volume. Then the small buttons could be used solely for track advancing or reversing, skipping etc. Overall I give the headphones a 4.8/5...performance-wise they are essentially perfect, and a couple of tiny design and connectivity tweaks would bring it to a 5. I love them!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As always with Tozo devices, these HT2 Noise Cancelling headphones arrived very well packaged and protected against damage.Upon opening the box, I was amazed by the look, feel and quality for this price \u2013 very very well made and I especially liked the very soft ear cushions that were very soft and moulded around the ear very efficiently blocking out a lot of sound even before utilising various effects via the Tozo app - these will not be a problem if wearing for hours at a time!Holding the \u201con\u201d button brings these to life (after charging via the USB-C port and supplied cable) and pairing to my phone Bluetooth was instant and without any issues at all. From the initial full charge, I still have 96% charge after listening to lots of music and upgrading the firmware, so the batter life is excellent.Once opening my Tozo app and clicking \u201cadd device\u201d they were immediately added allowing any of the many sound profiles to be used.One of the main features for me is the Active Noise Cancelling and I was not disappointed \u2013 selecting this via the app made a very noticeable change to external noise, in fact with music on, you can hardly hear anything around you.I am yet to try these on an airplane but having used other noise cancelling products, I am 100% sure that these will work extremely well \u2013 incidentally, there is also a cable included that will allow connection to an airplane audio socket as well as to a laptop!At first use, I noticed that there was an OTA firmware update available, this barely took 5 minutes to load which as great.In summary, these are absolutely outstanding for the price, Tozo have done a great job producing these at this quality level for this price.The only think that I would have liked to see in the box would have been a hard case for protection while carrying in my backpack or case, but I am sure that producing one dedicated to these earphones would have increased to cost significantly.If you are looking for some over-earphones with active noise cancelling and do not want to pay a premium price, then these are for you, they really are excellent!",

You can use it even without the battery discharged. Simply plug the 3.5 wire and it works.2. It has L / R characters clearly written on each sides of the unit. You cannot be confused with this. For the other products from Sony or others, it always took some time for me to figure out the correct orientation. I'm very happy with this.3. The joint is metal. It is very strong.4. It has separate buttons for the power, volume and NC functions.Sound-wise,1. What I like the most is, the bass is balanced. Headset from other brands like Dr. or others, their bass is way too strong. Way too strong. And I don't listen to Hip hop or club music very much. I like other sounds too. This headset catches all of them. But it doesn't mean that the bass is weak. It also has good bass. That's why, I'd like to say, it is well balanced.2. NC function is very impressive. It just works. It seems that it has two microphones on both sides. It works well.3. Hear-through or call feature are also nice.So in conclusion, I would like to recommend this product. The price is also very impressive. Just get one.",
