I bought them so I could plug my charging devices directly into the wall without having to have the USB adapter blocks. They work really well and it is so much more convenient to charge all of my devices now. Sometimes the light sensors that turn the nightlight on don't work when it gets dark, I don't think they are sensitive enough, but if you want them on you just have to put your hand over the light sensor for a second and they figure out that it is dark and turn on. This is only an occasional issue and easy enough to fix, and I bought these mainly for the plugs and not the nightlights so it doesn't really bother me too much.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for our family room because someone is always wanting to charge their phone or another electronic throughout the day. I like that it has regular outlets and USB ports. I didn't realize it when I bought it, but it has a \"lighted ring\" around the bottom (closest to the outlet) so it acts like a night light. So far, we have enjoyed it and use it often. A little too bulky for my travels, but still great.",
