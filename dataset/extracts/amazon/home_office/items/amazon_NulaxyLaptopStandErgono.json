My laptop is wider than the standard laptop so I was afraid that a laptop stand wouldn't work for mine, but this work works great!The stand comes in 3 pieces, it's very easy to assemble together. I got the purple one and it looks like the picture, it's has a beautiful shiny finish. The purple is darker in person but it's still beautiful! It seems pretty sturdy, I've had the stand for awhile now and it's still holding up my laptop great!The only thing I don't like about the stand is that the company name is on the stand on the bottom base. It's not super in-your-face but I'd prefer it if it wasn't there.",
