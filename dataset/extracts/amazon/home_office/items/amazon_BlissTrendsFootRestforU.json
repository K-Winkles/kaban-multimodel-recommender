                "reviewText": "I recently started using the BlissTrends Foot Rest at my office and at home, and it's been a game-changer for my comfort and posture.Adjustable Heights: One of the standout features is the adjustable height. The two options are perfect for accommodating different sitting positions, whether I'm at a standard desk or using a higher surface.Washable Cover: Hygiene is important, and the fact that the cover is washable makes maintenance a breeze. I've washed it once, and it came out looking as good as new.Comfort: The cushioning is neither too soft nor too firm, striking the perfect balance for comfortable foot support. I\u2019ve noticed a significant reduction in back and knee pain since I started using it.Multi-Use: Beyond the office, I've found it useful in the car for long drives and at home while sitting on the couch. Its versatility adds to its value.Durable: After weeks of regular use, the footrest shows no signs of wear and tear, attesting to its high quality.In summary, the BlissTrends Foot Rest has become an essential part of my daily routine for enhancing comfort and improving posture. A must-have for anyone spending long hours sitting!",

I'm an average sized male; 5'10\", 197lbs. My one complaint is the footrest would be better if it were a couple of inches wider. My feet and legs naturally rest a couple of inches further apart than the width of the footrest. Looking at other footrests, they all seem to be the same width.I did not notice any smell at all unlike some other reviewers. It is comfortable; the foam is spongy yet firm. It is height adjustable with the removal of the bottom part. Some other reviewers complained about it not really being height adjustable but you can clearly see how to adjust it and the limitations of the adjustment in the product description and photos. I can feel my back straightening out as I sit in my chair, like it has never done before. I've had so much back and leg pain and I can tell this is helping a lot even after only a couple of days of use.",

                "reviewText": "I work at a desk that used to belong to my dad. It's completely non-ergonometric, because back in the 50's they didn't worry about sissy stuff like that. Also, no one was sitting at computers all day long. Nowadays, though, I have to raise my chair height a lot to get my forearms at the right angle to work. Which means my legs, while not dangling, have to angle downwards to get my feet to the floor.Enter the foot rest! This is a good height for me (although it may not be for you, depending...) It's soft and squishy enough that my feet really feel good resting on it. (Unlike, say, the subwoofer that I was using as a footrest before.) Because it's half round, I can change the angle my feet are resting at during the day, which helps me stop wrapping them around my chair legs. And it helps keep my back straight.",

                "reviewText": "Was looking for a nice tall foot rest and this one is great. I like that you can either have the rounded side down so you can rock your feet on it or put it at any angle you might want your feet at OR you can have it flat side down and just move your feet around it both options are really comfy and it has a zippable cover so you can clean it. It is very study and firm so no worries about it being flimsy.",

With a simple Velcro attachment, you can customize the height of the footrest to suit your needs. Got long legs? No problem. Short legs? BlissTrends has got you covered.
