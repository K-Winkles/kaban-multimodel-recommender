The directions were very specific and it took very little time to get it set up. The quality is wonderful and he uses it to alternate between sitting and standing to relieve back pain. The height levels can be super easily adjusted with the touch of a button. I would highly recommend this table to anyone who needs to sit and stand to work.",

The packaging was clean and everything was clearly marked. Assembly itself was very easy; the entire desk is only a few pieces. For a smaller desk it has a good weight too it. I have a 49\" ultra wide monitor that is as wide as the desk is that is mounted to an articulating arm on the back of the desk the desk still sits nice and sturdy. The controls worked fine and the raising and lowering action is smooth enough for me. The motor is slightly louder than some other desks that I've used but that's not a problem for me at all. I love these little standing desks enough to buy two of them.",

The instructions were very easy to follow, so it didn't take too long to assemble. It looks great. The only issue I have is that there is some vibration with typing, which is slightly annoying. I am going to try a surface desk pad to see if that helps. But overall really pleased with the desk.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great, versatile desk for anyone, really, and the value of a desk of this size for as much as it's selling for with the features it has is certainly a selling point.The desk features three, easily re-programmable height settings and an up and down toggle to finesse the exact height of the desk up to a tenth of an inch. The sound of the motor used to raise the desk is comparable to a lego motor, i.e. you'll hear it, but it isn't disruptive. A more helpful analogy: just a little quieter than a Keurig coffee maker.The surface is shipped as two pieces, but both pieces match so that on a cursory glance you really cannot notice. There is nothing unsightly or ugly about this desk, and it turned out really good.Assembly was a breeze. If you can put together an IKEA desk, you can put together this one. With one key caveat: You do need a drill for the second to last part. This, of course, isn't included. As a person who doesn't assemble bought furniture very often, it took me about one-and-a-half-hours, but if I hadn't accidentally built it the wrong way about halfway through, it would probably take me 45 minutes.The build itself is sturdy, which is either a personal accomplishment (furniture I assemble tends to have a bit of a wobble) or a testament to the build quality. Unless something catastrophic happens, I would be happy to recommend this desk to anyone looking for one.",

                "reviewText": "I was completely surprised by the size of the box when I received it! The top is in two pieces, and it is packaged extremely well. The instructions were easy and it came together rather quickly. When operating the desk, it\u2019s really quiet and I like that you can have presets to return back to your comfortable sitting and standing positions. I feel like the desk is way taller than I expected, and the legs are decently far apart so I can fit my treadmill under with room to spare. It\u2019s a great addition for the price!",

                "reviewText": "This desk!! Bought it for the size and convenice of electronic raise/lower. I've had make shift desks or manually standing desks for years. Manual were ok but always a separate unit. This desk is a solid unit, easily assembled (did mine alone in about 30 min), has 3 presets you can set your preferred heights. I bought the 55\" for extra room and it is perfect for a laptop, mouse pad, extra monitor, with room left over for notepads, etc. Shipping was fabulous, they took care to use rubber around the corners. Arrived in perfect condition. A great investment for a home office and those who prefer a standing desk. Lots of room to have a desk chair when lowered and push to the side when standing, using a normal size padded desk chair. Absolutely love this desk!",

                "reviewText": "In my opinion, this standing desk:1. Offers great value ($109+tax on Amazon)2. Was relatively easy to assemble. All parts were in the package and there were even some extras. All parts were clearly marked. All tools to assemble were provided, though it is easier if you have a few of your own. You could tell that the designers had given thought to simplifying the assembly process.3. Had construction quality that was surprisingly good, better than most of the furniture I have purchased online. The fact that everything fit together well facilitated rapid assembly.4. Featured excellent design. Even when it is raised to full height by the motor, it seems to be stable.",
