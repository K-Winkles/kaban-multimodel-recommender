The front of the shredder head should be aligned with the each side of the trash can. A2: Overheating Protection, this design with 3 minutes continuous run time with 40 minutes cool down after use again. A3: Paper jams can also be one of the reasons for not working- Please use the FWD and REV function to clean up the cutter scraps. Q2: The cross-cut shredder is jammed. What should I do? A1: Please switch to FWD mode and shred the jammed paper compulsorily. If there are too many paper scraps in the feed slot, slide to FWD mode for a few seconds and then to REV mode for a few seconds to clear it. A2: With stubborn situations, you may need to clean the jammed paper with shredder oil. Start by drizzling oil into the feed slot where the paper is jammed. Let it soak for about 30 minutes, turn the shredder to Auto-On mode, a rigid sheet of cardstock (or folded file folder) can be fed into the shredder to help push the jammed paper through With the shredder unplugged. Q3: Why is the number of sheets that can be shredded lower than the maximum number of sheets described? A1: Please check if the paper is damp, contains plastic or too thick, if so, please let the paper dry before shredding, or remove the plastic part, or reduce shredding papers per pass. To extend the lifetime of the paper shredder, please don't shred more than 6 sheets in one time.",

                "reviewText": "My 12-sheet shredder just died one day. It was a heavy machine that sat atop a plastic basket and needed a good fit for the \u201cactuating pin\u201d to sit on this plastic receptacle bin. Over time, the weight of that shredder had cracked the bin and made everything unusable. No replacement for the bin available and superglue and duck tape just wasn\u2019t working.I considered a new shredder that had a pull out bin, but after analyzing how much use (including number of sheets to feed into the machine at one time), cost, and overall weight of the machine, I realized a lightweight shredder might meet my needs. Good decision on my part.Excellent aspects:It is very lightweight machine that has an excellent and comfortable folding handle to lift it off the included basket. I have serious arthritis in both wrists and most fingers, and I can lift this off without any issues at all. It also easily seats right back into the correct position without any problems when put back onto the receptacle bin.It is pretty quiet when running.It has a window that clearly tells you when the bin is getting full, ensuring that you do not overfill and jam the machine. When full, the bin is easy to lift and dump its shredded pieces into a larger trash bag. The pieces may get a little statically attached to the plastic bin, so try covering the opening of the bin with a trash bag before you invert the bin and then tap the aides of the bin to get all the shredded pieces into the trash bag. I still had to round up some \u201cshred debris\u201d that clung to the inside of basket or missed the bag\u2026not big deal.Price was awesome!Average/neutral aspects:My previous shredder had a lock out mechanism that let me ensure the shredder could not be accidentally turned on if the main selector switch was unintentionally moved to the \u201con\u201d position. This machine does not have such a feature. It has 4 positions: FWD (on with continuous shredder wheels engaged regardless of whether something is sensed in the shredder slot), AUTO (power on, but shredder wheels not engaged unless something is sensed in the shredder slot), REV (shredder wheels in constant motion, but pushing things back out of the feeder slot), and OFF (which powers down the machine, red power light goes off). As there is no \u201cguard switch\u201d to prevent accidental activation, I simply unplugged it when I am not using it for a time and if any small children/pets are around.It also has an overheat light if the motor os getting too hot from continuous or heavy load use.It is not top heavy, but still can be tipped over if you move or bump against it. I have it freestanding on the floor between a similar sized trash can and the side of my desk. I have had no problems with it tipping or moving during use.There is a credit card slot, and while the machine will \u201cchew\u201d these up, you can hear the machine slow and even see the credit card wobble as it is being shredded. Worked OK as I only shred a card or two annually.I would not place more than 3-4 sheets of regular paper in at one time as you can hear the machine slowing to shred that amount. I am sure it can do more, but I decided to simply be cautious. The machine does shred as quickly as most residential use machines, however.Note: The actual continuous run time on this machine is much better than advertised. I ran it for 10 minutes without any problems, although I was only inserting 1-2 sheets at a time, not the max they say you can at a time. No overheat light came one, albeit the top of the machine did become a little warm.Overall, very happy with this machine. It will only get used every couple of weeks and then for only about 15-20 sheets of paper or other junk ail (credit card mailings, credit card receipts, etc\u2026",

                "reviewText": "Well, let me tell you about my new favorite home appliance, the 6-Sheet Crosscut Paper and Credit Card Shredder, aka my paper munching beast! I mean, who knew shredding could be so entertaining?First off, this thing is an absolute champ. I've been on a mission to declutter my life, and this shredder has been my trusty sidekick in the battle against rogue paper. I kid you not; I ran it for a whopping 50 minutes straight, and it didn't even break a sweat. I've never seen a more committed piece of machinery. It's like the Terminator of the paper-shredding world \u2013 relentless and unstoppable.Now, here's where it gets interesting. I decided to put this bad boy to the test with my mountain of unopened junk mail. It handled it like a champ, but I could almost hear it grumble a bit. It's like the shredder equivalent of a sigh, you know? Like, \"Come on, really? More junk?\" It did slow down a tad, but hey, even superheroes need a breather when faced with an avalanche of unwanted credit card offers and pizza coupons.The crosscut action is like a dance, gracefully turning my sensitive information into a confetti party. It's a disco for documents! The credit card shredding is especially satisfying \u2013 talk about cutting up those bad spending habits, literally.But the real star of the show is the noise. Oh boy, the symphony of destruction that emanates from this thing is a head-turner. It's like having a tiny rock concert in my living room every time I decide to declutter. My neighbors probably think I'm running a secret home office or moonlighting as a spy with all the shredding espionage going on.In conclusion, this Paper Shredder for Home Use is not just a machine; it's a statement. It has the endurance of an Olympic athlete, the precision of a surgeon, and the dramatic flair of a Hollywood blockbuster. If you want to turn your mundane paperwork into a thrilling spectacle, get yourself one of these bad boys. It's the rockstar of the shredding world \u2013 just make sure to bring your air guitar! \ud83c\udfb8\u2702\ufe0f",
