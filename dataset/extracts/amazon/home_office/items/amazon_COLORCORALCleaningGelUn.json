                "reviewText": "EDITED REVIEW on 6/24/2020 - About two months have passed since I purchased this product and I am changing my review from 5 stars to 4. After about a month, it seems like the integrity of the product began to decrease. Where previously the goop would tend to stay in a ball shape (unless intentionally stretched), after a month or so of use it feels more \"liquid-y\" and leaves sticky residue behind. Now I am cautious when using it on my keyboard because it has left little sticky blobs behind. SO, this product works great at first, but after you open it the lifespan of the product is about a 4-6 weeks before it starts to be more of a hassle to use. Since there is no way to clean this stuff, you'll have to throw it away and get a new one. I wish the lifespan of the goop was longer.This stuff has literally changed how I clean my desk and keyboard. I used to use a combo of canned air (not always very effective) and a Swiffer, but even still the dust would just blow up in the air and then resettle on my keyboard again later. This stuff reminds me of the slime that kids are really into playing with right now, but it's not really sticky in a tacky way, so it doesn't leave any residue behind. I can squish this in between my keyboard keys and get out all of the cat hair and crumbs.(I probably would not use this if I had to deep clean my keyboard because some of the goopy stuff might get stuck under the keys.)this stuff is nice because it also doesn't really have a noticeable smell, so after handling it your hands and desk don't have a chemical smell.if you have a dusty office or cats that like to shed in the keyboard, this product will change your life. It'll make cleaning the keyboard kind of fun instead of a gross task. I will definitely be buying more of this stuff around Christmas time for my coworkers.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is genius. I have a quite large collection of crystals and many of them are incredibly hard to clean thoroughly - regular dusting is rarely sufficient and many are not suitable for cleaning in water and, even with those that are, it's still hard to get into all the cracks and crevices of clusters and then there's the drying time. I've also tried hand vacs and blow dryers with super long cords - again, not at all ideal. I saw this product and immediately thought of my collection and I wasn't wrong. I felt like Handel's Hallelujah Chorus should have been playing when I first used it on my sphalerite and rough azurite/malachite pieces. Just genius! And with quartz clusters it is, obviously, perfect. I will say that it does stick a bit occasionally, but that it's easy to get it to pull off. It also needs to be replaced relatively frequently during cleaning sessions (a palm sized piece will only go for 3 or 4 large trays), but it's cheap enough that I don't care. And, clearly, there are some stones I am hesitant to use it on, such as astrophylite or thomsonite with mesolite needles - anything with very delicate parts that could be dislodged, although, I will say that I have used it very gently and successfully on some of my astrophylite pieces. But, in the end, what matters is that I've finally found something that works.",

It did on the flat surfaces, but where the \"wall\" meets the \"floor\" of the compartments, it only got about 80%, and in the corners where two \"walls\" and the \"floor\" meet, it left maybe 40% behind. I have better luck with a car detailing hose on a portable vacuum followed by a cleaning wipe.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to help my give my keyboard a much needed deep clean. Took the keys off, and used this along with some q-tips and toothpicks to clean everything up. This cleaning gel works very well to lift dust and other items out of recesses and clean around complex shapes like the key bases. It sticks well to itself and debris but doesn't get stuck in the keyboard. Don't expect it to be able to lift off stuff that's well stuck down - but that's ok, because if it was that sticky it would just get everywhere.I was able to do the keyboard with a small chunk, and have ~80% remaining for future cleaning projects. I foresee me using it in my car to clean the dashboard, steering wheel, etc.",
