These pens also have a nice grip to them and I LOVE the feel of them. The feeling is so smooth and I love how the pens have a matte finish. I also love the small little ball on the clip of the pen- I love to fidget with it and it is so satisfying.Writing with these pens is so enjoyable. It is so smooth and fun to write with. The ink dries pretty quickly as the description says which is really nice because I find it hard to write with other gel pens because they don't dry as quick. Adding onto that, these pens don't smear when you highlight!! I use these pens for school and I often have to highlight so these pens are great! I love the fact that these pens don't bleed through paper at all as well.Overall these pens are high quality and I'd recommend these to anyone who does a lot of writing!",

And super picky.When the job is rough, you hold to little joys where you can find them and for me, one of those joys is a good pen.A good pen must be comfortable to hold. Nothing clunky or awkward. It has to be fine-tipped and write smoothly, but not so fine-tipped that it pokes holes through whatever you\u2019re writing on. It can\u2019t dry up after only a few uses. And NO LIDS. They just get in the way, fall on the floor (in the hospital the floor is lava\u2014you don\u2019t want things to fall there), or get lost.Bonus points if it looks nice and is affordable, too!These pens check all the boxes! They\u2019re so nice that every time I let someone borrow my pen (while watching like a hawk to make sure I get it back, of course), they always end up saying, \u201coooh, this is a nice pen!\u201dThe fine tip enables me to write really small notes on my handoff report sheets without it looking like a giant ink smear. Nice and crisp!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a set of pens, and while they have their merits, I must admit that I had mixed results with them. Let me share my experience, starting with the positive aspects.First and foremost, the design and build quality of these pens are quite impressive. The sleek and ergonomic design offers a comfortable grip, allowing for long writing sessions without any discomfort. The pen's body feels sturdy, and the retractable mechanism functions smoothly, ensuring convenience and ease of use.Additionally, the ink flow, when it works properly, is consistent and vibrant. The pens produce clean lines with a fine point, making them suitable for both writing and precise detailing. The range of colors included in the set is also a nice touch, adding a touch of creativity to my notes and projects.However, the main drawback I encountered with these pens was their tendency to skip or have intermittent ink flow. It was frustrating to find that, occasionally, the ink would refuse to flow smoothly onto the paper, resulting in uneven and broken lines. This inconsistency was not limited to a single pen in the set but seemed to be a recurring issue across multiple pens.While the skipping issue wasn't constant, it occurred frequently enough to be noticeable and hamper the overall writing experience. I tried various techniques, such as applying different pressure and angles, to alleviate the problem, but unfortunately, the results were hit or miss.Considering the price point of these pens, I had expected better performance and more reliable ink flow. It's disappointing to encounter such inconsistency, as it disrupts the smooth flow of thoughts and hampers the overall quality of my work.In conclusion, the set of pens I purchased had both positive and negative aspects. The pens boast an appealing design, comfortable grip, and vibrant ink when they work properly. However, the persistent issue of ink skipping detracts from their overall functionality and reliability. If you're willing to take a chance on occasional ink flow issues, these pens might be worth considering, but I would recommend exploring other options if you require consistent and uninterrupted writing performance.",
