This is perfect & includes all the things I need for each meeting - note wise. Great to keep me organized. The front cover is bent a little bit but I\u2019m hoping it will work itself out with time.",

The layout is organized & plenty of room for notes, etc. The only draw back is, the cover was bent; just as other reviewers stated. No amount of bending it back & forth or putting something heavy on it (over night) fixes it. Annoying. Besides that, I'd buy again.",

It\u2019s cute and perfect for work, but I always forget about it until I see the ad Pop up on Amazon with my recent purchases.
