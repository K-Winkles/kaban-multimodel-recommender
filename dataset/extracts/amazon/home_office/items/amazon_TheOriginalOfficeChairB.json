                "reviewText": "This chair blanket is an absolute game-changer for anyone working in a cold office. It's become a must-have for me, and I can't imagine my workspace without it.The concept of having a blanket attached to my office chair is pure genius. Not only does it save me from the discomfort of shivering through those chilly workdays, but it also keeps me cozy and productive. The convenience factor is off the charts \u2013 no more searching for a spare blanket or fumbling with layers of clothing. When the AC is pumping in summer, this is great because I can still wear summer clothes for when I'm outside on my walk breaks, but the office is freezing.What I love most about this is its thoughtful design. The blanket wraps around my shoulders and lap, providing just the right amount of warmth without feeling bulky or restrictive. It's like having a personal, customizable cocoon of comfort.The attachment to the chair is secure and doesn't slip or slide, allowing me to move freely without worrying about it falling off. The fabric is soft and cozy.If you're tired of freezing at your desk, this is a must-have addition to your workspace. I can't recommend it enough.",

It sometimes gets chilly in the room during the winter when I\u2019m recording and this is the perfect solution for that. Two pieces drape over the shoulders and two pieces drape across my lap. It keeps my torso and arms warm while recording. It was super easy to install and adjust to fit my particular chair. My only complaint would be the backing is a little flimsy and will sometimes \u201cpop\u201d when I go from leaning forward to sitting back against it again. Overall, a great product.",

Wollte auch nicht das typische \"Fahren \u00fcber die Decke\" Problem haben. Da die einzelnen Teile so lang sind, bleiben diese auf dem Boden liegen, wenn man die Decke gerade nicht im Gebrauch hat, was das Problem leider nicht behoben hat. Schnelles Aufstehen ist drin ja, aber beim Hinsetzten muss man sich erstmal die Teile so zurecht nudeln, dass es wieder passt. Zus\u00e4tzlich hat der R\u00fccken leider nicht gut an meinen Stuhl auf der Arbeit gepasst (zuhause war es passend). Also meiner Meinung nach war es f\u00fcr mich das Geld nicht wert, deshalb habe ich es auch zur\u00fcck geschickt. Jemand anderem wird es schon eher passen.Und der Karton war zus\u00e4tzlich gut besch\u00e4digt was auch nicht so nice war.",
