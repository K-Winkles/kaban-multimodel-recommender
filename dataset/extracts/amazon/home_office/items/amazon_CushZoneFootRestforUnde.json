I would catch myself resting my feet on the legs of the chair and it was uncomfortable and not ergo at all. A lot of the options on Amazon were either weirdly shaped or uncomfortable looking.For $16, this is exactly what I want and need. As soon as I got this home, i let the pillow fluff up on its own and it was ready to go in 30 mins or less. They're just the right height for me and my knees no longer feel sore after a full day in my chair.",

It wish it was a bit higher but it's comfortable I guess. It comes flattened out and once out of the package it comes back to life.If your using this for your job where you would be wearing shoes, then it's going to get nasty. This material is too plushy for my taste, it dips in when you put your feet on it. I can't imagine this lasting too long after day in and day out of putting the bottom of your shoes on it.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this product for a few weeks now and love it. I work at a desk in IT. The way I lean back in my chair, the chair always cuts into my legs and causes them to either go numb or just hurt by the end of the day.After having this my legs don't hurt anymore as it keeps my legs elevated over the edge of the chair and with the cloud feeling, it keeps my feet from hurting from being on the hard floor. Also haves my shoes from the rubbing on the ground.I was sceptical when it arrived as it was flat as a pancake but when I unwrapped it, it blew up and looked like the picture in Amazon. It has a zipper and Velcro to keep it stable but my Velcro does not seam even so it looks like it uneven but the zipper evened it out. The zipper is also hard to work with (for me) but I just keep it zipped up.I love the fact you can wash the fabric part of it. All in all this is a great product for your self or even for a gift. Keep up the great work with this guys.",
