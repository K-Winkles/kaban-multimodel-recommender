                "reviewText": "This is a great little power strip I purchased during a \"Lightning Deal\" during Prime Days for $30. While that is a bit pricey, I needed a power strip to attach to a metal desk frame and this works perfectly. I do like that the outlets are spaced far enough apart so I can utilize all outlets when some of the plugs are the larger brick type. This model comes with 3 outlets, 2 USB-A, and 2 USB-C outlets. The USB outlets are quick charging. They do offer a 5 outlet power strip as well. The clamp securely attaches to the frame and does not move when unplugging cords. Of note...the product description says it is a surge protector and the box says \"overcurrent protection\" with no mention on level of protection. Overall, pleased with this purchase.Update: Taking one star off as the USB outlet does not always work with the little light I use at the desk. I have to use a brick and take up an outlet when using the light.",
