The one at work is perfect because it\u2019s an older computer with a wide border around the screen so the part where it sticks on to the computer blends in and looks seamless. The computer at home however is newer with a very thin border and a wide screen so there\u2019s no where to stick it on. If the adhesive were on the front of the product instead of the back I might be able to secure it onto the back of the computer, but instead I just can\u2019t use it. So perfect product for older computers but if you\u2019ve got a newer one I say just get a phone stand and stick to sticky notes.",

You get two plastic panels. I intended to use one on the right side of both my home and work computer. With the name/logo etched on the clear part it upside on one panel. The maker has one panel for the left side and one for the right. I did not intend to use them both for one monitor.",
