I was able to stock up with pink, purple, and blue paper, with some wide lined and some \"college ruled.\" They fit into most greeting card envelopes with just one fold, so I can add a note and not write all over the card. I send a great many cards (I know, a dying habit) and often I haven't seen the person in a while, so a little paper chat helps keep in touch, *I sent rny granddaughter 85 pages in her birthday card (haven't seen her since July), and my other one a 72 (i Think) page one. These little pages are perfect size for all of Grandma's helpful un-asked-for advice. Sometimes paper on a pad doesn't tear of well. This paper does - it tears clean across the top - and there's no yucky glue residue anywhere, since it isn't glued. It's more of a perforated tear=away. I adore these pads, and I hope Amazon Basic keeps stocking them. They are WONDERFUL!",
