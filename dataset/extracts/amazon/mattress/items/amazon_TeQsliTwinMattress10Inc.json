I\u2019m not joking - I actually measured the springs and they\u2019re 11 inches high. I allowed it to expand the full 72 hours before laying on the mattress and was shocked when the springs were pushing right through into my skin (and I only weigh 135 lbs). In addition, parts of the mattress were firm, others were indented. Also, the springs are fairly noisy as you move around. There was no possible way an adult could comfortably sleep on this mattress. I wondered how this mattress could have any positive reviews - then I found out when the company contacted me offering to pay if you remove the negative review! There are plenty of better mattresses out there, don\u2019t waste your time on this one!",

I appreciated that the foam did not have a bad odor as we have tried other products that smelled for a few days after opening the package. After the mattress expanded, it looked nice and seemed to be good quality. The fabric on the top did have a few rolls that didn\u2019t flatten out as well as I had hoped as well as the side fabric not being as tight as I hoped it would be after the 72 hour expansion. The workmanship, stitching and feel of the mattress is very nice. My daughter has been sleeping on it for a week now and she thinks it\u2019s really comfortable. The mattress seems to be on the softer side of medium firm which our daughter likes. My only concern is if it will be supportive enough as she gets older and bigger. Overall for the price, think this is a good option when considering the fast shipping, no bad smells and nice workmanship of the mattress.",

I can tell it's an extremely well-made mattress that will last for a long time. It also comes with a 10 year warranty (which can be extended by 2 years if you register the product within 14 days of purchase on the TeQsli website).",

                "reviewText": "I moved into a furnished flat a few months ago and have been struggling to get a decent sleep on the mattress that was included with the place when we moved in. I hadn't bought a mattress without testing it previously, but this one looked good and sounded good so I thought it was worth a shot.I had read reviews of other mattresses and had seen that people made comments that occasionally they were smells or they took a long time to reinflate. Once opened, I can happily say that neither of these were the case with this mattress. When I opened it, it exploded with great aplomb nearly taking out myself and the TV. Be careful when you open it! It expanded very quickly and was ready to lay on within about half an hour. You can see that I set it up initially on top of my existing mattress as I was expecting it to take a while to expand but that wasn't the case.There's absolutely no smell from it at all. It just smells like a mattress, which is ideal.Somehow it manages to be both very cushy and soft but also supportive. I am a side and occasional stomach sleeper and it suits both of these positions well. When on my side my shoulder and my hip will somewhat sink into the mattress, but the pillow doesn't, which is again ideal and means that my spine stays straight and supported. It is cushy to sleep on your stomach so of course that's very comfortable if that's your thing.I was concerned about whether the mattress would be hot because of the memory foam component, but it's no more warm than any other pillow top mattress I've ever used. It's soft and plush but not sweaty even in this summer heat.All said I would definitely recommend this mattress. I think it's well worth it's cost and I have been sleeping soundly since purchase.",

Was so impressed that we decided to replace all the mattresses in the house. Our plan was to buy a new one every month and by Christmas all would have been replaced. Times got a little bit tougher and the monthly purchase took 4 months. I clicked from by purchase history to buy it again and also thought I would see if they have pillows too. I didn't find pillows but I did notice this mattress. New and improved vibe from the add, so decided to purchase this instead. Dimensions are the same but definitely feel different, I am guessing that the springs are different. Very comfy and with the same warranty. The only issue is that now everyone wants the black mattress. Can really recommend TeQsli and will be buying again 3 more before Christmas.",
