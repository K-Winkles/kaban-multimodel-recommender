                "reviewText": "I just now took it out of the plastic and it is on my daybed. It has inflated quite a bit in just an hour . 8 hours later it is at 8 inches, slept on it, very, very good nights sleep. I got medium-firm and it is perfect. I had a medium before this and it was too soft. But I had a thoracic-posterior spinal fusion, my entire thoracic, lumbar & both lower back discs were removed and are now made of metal. I have been a back sleeper ever since, so I didn\u2019t want to go firm, case it felt like a board but this medium firm is just right. It\u2019s soft on the body yet is holds your body up, you feel the support. Like sleeping on a cloud knowing that you\u2019re not going to fall through it. I hope it stands the test of time. It was definitely worth the price. I was going to give it 4 stars because it\u2019s not made in USA nor is the country of origin in USA like the ad states but I gave it 5 because I\u2019m grading the mattress and it deserves 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased a memory foam topper from this same brand when my Mom was coming to visit. She has back pain and I was a bit worried, but it was really comfortable and she loved it. So, when it came time to order a new mattress for our condo, I decided to give this one a try. I am so glad that I did. It arrived nicely packed in vacuum sealed plastic and in a box. This was great because it was easy to transport to the condo, but also is good just to get it into the room of your choice easily. The mattress opened up to its full size fairly quickly, but we allowed a full 48 hours prior to using it. It had no noticeable odor and came clean and in good condition. The mattress itself is soft, but not so much that it is uncomfortable. It feels very supportive and is conducive to a great night's sleep. When I get up from it, the memory foam quickly regains its original shape and does not leave my indent. This is a very comfortable mattress and great value for the money. It fit on my bed perfectly, and I would certainly buy another memory foam mattress from this brand again.",

It just got worse, so I tried Phoof. Nothing helped. It absorbs moisture from your body and starts to stink like dirty feet! After 9 months of it we had to get rid of the mattress. It's like new but can't be used because of the awful oder. I would never buy this product again.",
