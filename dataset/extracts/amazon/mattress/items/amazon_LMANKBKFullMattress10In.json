            "{{Cool Sleep On A Breathable Mattress}}- Compared with mattresses made of single material, LMANKBK hybrid mattresses are generally cooler and more comfortable. The skin-friendly fabric and the perforated memory foam promote heat dissipation, the individually wrapped coil structure underneath enhances the air flow inside the mattress, keeping you cool and comfortable for the whole night.",
            "{{Better Support and Back Pack Relief}}- This medium firm mattress contains multiple support layers that allow the mattress to fit exactly every part of your body. As the pressure on the shoulder, back, spine, and buttocks can be evenly distributed, the pressure point where the body contacts the mattress can be relieved, helping to eliminate your physical fatigue and pain.",
            "{{Isolated Motion}}- LMANKBK pocket spring mattress is supported by hundreds of reinforced pocket coils, each working independently to be noiseless and reduce the vibration of bed motion. Therefore, your deep sleep will never be disturbed by your partner\u2019s turning over or getting up. Full Mattress Measures 54\"W*75\"L*10\"H and supports a maximum weight of 700 lbs",
            "{{Full Size Bed In a Box}}- The mattress is compressed and rolled into a box, which can be easily transported to the door for installation. Remember to keep enough distance from the mattress when unwrapping, because it may cause injury to bystanders when expanding. Please be patient and wait for 48-72 hours for it to fully expand. It is suitable for a variety of frames, such as box springs, slatted bases, flat platforms, adjustable beds, and even floors.",
            "{{Quality Guarantee}}- LMANKBK mattresses are covered by a 10-year warranty and 30-day refund policy. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact LMANKBK customer support team at any time."

This bed is very comfortable and fits all the reviews given. The sides don't have good support, but as long as you know that going into it, like the other reviews said, then I didn't mind. The bed fits myself, my boyfriend, and our two large dogs without being squished, and for the price, you can't beat it! Took only about 12-24 hours to fully inflate, and its very comfortable. This helps ease my mind when buying in the future. who knows i might even buy this one again.",

                "reviewText": "I love this mattress, especially for the $$. I purchased the 12in Full size. It's super soft, but feels supportive. I have a bunch of issues with my spine and shoulders and have chronic pain due to those issues. Have a lot of issues with sleeping. Been thru 4 mattresses since January. This is my 5th and this is the winner. It's almost too comfortable. I can't say it has a \"cooling effect\" but unlike other mattresses I've had, I don't feel uncomfortable sleeping on this. Not kicking sheets and blankets off. I have no AC so it gets super hot in my house. I waited just over 48 hours to let in inflate before sleeping on it. It inflated to 10 \u00b9/2 at the seem but if you looking from its side, the actual mattress fluffed up to 12. Be careful with this... make sure the mattress is at angle that it will roll out away from you. My first time purchasing a bet that was compressed. POOF When it was on the floor there was minimal movement in the mattress. I sleep with a 65lb furbaby and he's always shifting positions. On the slatted frame now is a different story. So I advise making sure you have a strong sturdy frame. I feel like I kinda sink slightly into this. It's cozy. There's no pressure at my hips. Little bit at my shoulder. Little repositioning and no pressure anywhere. I do NOT feel the springs at all. No sounds from them either. There isn't really support on the sides so if you sit on the edge you will slip off. This was my 3rd night and I can honestly say I haven't slept this well in what feels like years! Usually I have trouble the 1st week or so getting used to a new mattress but this one.... I slept amazingly my first night and woke up with minimal pain. Overall is a great mattress at the price it's being offered. Expensive doesn't always mean better. I'm sleeping comfortably again so that's what matters.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited to be able to buy a new mattress for the guest bedroom or so my husband could just escape to rest and take a nap in that room. But I must admit that I didn't like it at all. The mattress is not firm at all when you sit down, it squishes horribly. It doesn't stay firm and when you lie down it sinks a little. I don't think I would buy it again. I just wanted to save a little money.",
