I tried innerspring mattresses that I went and tried in the store, I tried hybrid beds on line, no luck. This bed is by far the best I\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t have back pain anymore, I sleep like a baby, I got the medium, although I am a stomach sleeper and firm probably would\u2019ve been slightly better. But I still can\u2019t complain, I can sleep on my stomach with no issue. I\u2019m so thankful, I could just hug the seller! Serta is definitely a good choice for a quality bed. I\u2019ll send in an update later to attest to the durability, but I\u2019ve had it about two months now and I\u2019m really happy!",

                "reviewText": "I spent countless hours researching mattresses to try to choose the right one for my needs. I\u2019m chronically ill, so I spend a lot more time in bed than the average person. And it\u2019s crucial for me to have a bed that\u2019s comfortable.I chose this one for two primary reasons. I need a very soft bed that I can sink into, otherwise it hurts. This was advertised as plush, and the image showing a person lying on their side on the bed shows them sinking into it quite a bit. It also describes being very soft and being able to sink into it.The other reason I chose this one is because it has three different forms of cooling technology. I run very hot when I sleep, and I cannot have a mattress that retains heat or I just can\u2019t sleep.Unfortunately, all of that was a lie.The mattress is extremely firm. Yes, it has a pillow top. But once you sink into that 1st inch or two, it\u2019s hard as a rock. I might as well have a thin mattress topper on top of a slab of wood. It\u2019s absolutely miserable for someone who needs a soft bed.All of this so-called cooling technology? Nope. I\u2019ve slept on memory foam beds that do retain some heat and aren\u2019t terribly comfortable for me, but this one was the absolute worst I\u2019ve ever slept on in my life. it has zero cooling properties, although it does feel quite cool when you first get into it. But the whole idea of the cooling technology is to cool you off while you sleep, not to be cold when you first get in and then turn to broil. In the worst part? With a different mattress, you could at least move to a cooler spot on the bed, but with this one, the entire bed heats up!As if all of that isn\u2019t bad enough, getting this thing delivered was an absolute nightmare. The day that they were supposed to come, they just never showed up and I wasn\u2019t able to reach anyone because their office was closed during my delivery window! When I finally got in touch with somebody the next day, they told me that that delivery window doesn\u2019t even exist. I had already lined up help to be able to get everything changed out and re-situated, plus set aside, specific time for the delivery window that I scheduled. I called the next day, they just informed me that they were going to come the following Monday anytime throughout the day . And where to even willing to give me a choice in selecting a delivery window on a day that works for me.Thankfully, the district manager of the third-party delivery company ended up working with me, although he said that they\u2019ve been trying to get Amazon to remove the incorrect delivery window for a long time. I\u2019m not sure who was at fault, but if that delivery window was an issue, then the third-party company should not have sent me an email confirming it! I received confirmation both from Amazon and from the third-party company. But I did finally get it delivered. It just took a huge amount of time and hassle.I wish I could give negative stars. This entire experience has been a nightmare and I greatly regret buying this. I\u2019m glad that they have a good refund policy, but they don\u2019t come and pick it up for you, so I\u2019m going to need to find help once again to get it out of the frame and figure out how to get it out of my house when I can get a new bed to replace it. And I may end up having to hire somebody to do that because I don\u2019t have a lot of local friends and most of them are very strong either. This thing weighs 125 pounds and takes a bit of muscle to move. I also don\u2019t have a truck to haul it away, so I\u2019m hopeful that I can find somebody local who needs a bed and has the ability to transport it to come get it.",
