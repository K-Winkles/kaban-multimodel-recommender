Sturdy & easy to move around once it was filled out. I'll come back & update once we've used it more, but so far I'm happy with it & considering a king for the master!",

After reaching around 225 the bed got better. Not sinking so far into the bed helps with my pain, although physical health most definitely contributes to this pain as well. Great bed if you\u2019re not overweight. 4/5",
