However, a VRBO stay was my introduction to this mattress and 4 months after purchase, I'm not disappointed. A relative (at same VRBO) who usually recommends a Tempurpedic was extremely impressed with the comfort and restful sleep experience as well. A few details: mattress does need 72+ hours to fully expand (may not be full 10\" but it was close), medium firmness with decent edge support, gel does sleep cooler than regular Tempurpedic foam topper used for a few years prior, and the queen was slightly longer than old box spring being used as platform. One surprise - I'm a sidesleeper but found I can comfortably sleep on my stomach like I did in my youth! Obviously, not sure of mattresses life span, but based on the price, dont think I'll be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I was reading about 1000 reviews on beds before finally committing to one. I will update this review in time to see how it performs in the future, but for now I wanted to add to the reviews the overwhelmed shoppers like myself will see. I wrote this review after having it for 2 weeks, but now after 3 years, my positive comments still hold up!Overall, I absolutely love this bed. It came right when it was promised, and I let it expand for nearly the entire 48 hour recommended time. It's only gotten to around 9\", but I'm not too worried about it, it's comfortable and a very good size as is, wouldn't change a thing. There was a slight chemical smell that has gone away as I let the mattress rise. I also read that people had trouble with fiberglass... well don't remove the cover. I believe it is to protect the mattress from some liquids, and it isn't intended to be removed. So I avoided that and don't have a problem with it at all.My biggest worry was mold. Thankfully no other reviews mentioned mold, so I thought I was safe. And when I received it, there was no appearance or smell of mold whatsoever. Good stuff!When people explain that it is both soft and firm, they are absolutely right. The first maybe 2 inches are soft, while the rest is supported by a more firm foam. This allows me, a small 120lb woman, to sink in but not keep sinking in. I hated memory foam because I would never sink the way I wanted so it felt way too firm. I really feel like I am supported in all the ways I need to be. I have never woken up in any pain, and I have even been sleeping all the way through the nights. I guess you don't realize how much you were suffering on a bad mattress until you get a new one!Finally, it is even a very comfortable mattress for 2! I don't find my arm getting sore or loosing circulation in any cuddling positions so far. I know that is a little weird, but for anyone looking for a mattress for 2, I hope it helps. The \"medium\" feel of both soft and firm has kept us both very happy, as I am someone who loves a soft bed, and him firm.The other biggest complaint I've read is that it doesn't last very long, so I updated my review about a year later. So far, it works just as well as the first day I got it! I'm still so comfortable!!I am updating again after 3 years. I am still so happy and comfortable on it! It does feel like the top \"soft\" later got a little softer, but the high density part beneath remains wonderfully supportive. I also don't feel like the additional softness over time is a bad thing by any means. My husband and I do not fall to the middle anywhere, and still cuddle comfortably through the full night.The only bad thing is that I babysat for a dog who loved thrashing around on a bed, and I think his nails caused some small kind of pilling effect on the top foam layer. But even with that, I don't feel it and it doesn't affect the function of the mattress. You only notice if you are running your hand over the bed and looking for it.After 3 years, I could not be happier. I want everyone to have this mattress!!!",

It 'fluffs' back up nicely and is very supportive. (I know fluffs isn't the right term but I couldn't remember the right one. LOL) The price was good and the quality is excellent. I'd buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "I seem to have bought a lot of mattresses over the last few years. Six or seven. I always by fairly inexpensive memory foam ones ($3-400) and all who sleep on them are very happy including myself. This one was for a guest bedroom so I bought this less expensive one. Upon opening it up, it swelled up predictably and has formed a fine shape. It did take over a week for the smell to dissipate but that was only to be expected. It's only been used a handful of times so far but it seems to be perfectly comfortable, supportive and sag-free. Comparable to our other mattresses. One of the above ratings is for softness which is a bit of a daft metric. It's quite firm, which I like but I couldn't exactly give it 5 stars for softness nevertheless the fabric is pleasantly soft.",

                "reviewText": "I was extremely skeptical about buying this mattress. Boy, was I wrong! I'm 68 and I've been picky about my bed for many years. I've paid upwards of $1000 for a mattress several times. A good night's sleep is so important. Now that I'm older I was unhappy with a firm mattress as I would get sore spots - hips, shoulders, ribs, anywhere that the pressure was too much. So I thought about a foam mattress. Upon looking, I saw that this mattress had pages of great reviews, including ones that claimed they didn't wake up with sore spots. I checked the return policy and felt safe trying this one out. I was pretty sure it would be going back.I've now had the best night's sleep that I've experienced in years. This mattress is unbelievably comfortable. There were zero issues with it expanding and it was ready enough for me in 24 hours. I have no idea how high it got and I didn't care. I was just desperate to be comfortable and rested so I used it the second night.Everyone is looking for different things in a mattress, so I'm sure this isn't for everyone, but for me it was the perfect mattress at an unbelievably good price. It came sooner than promised and was perfectly packaged, clean and relatively odor free. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.On a side note, I have a small bedroom and wanted the bed to have as small a profile as possible. I ordered the Amazon Basics Foldable Metal Platform Bed Frame with Tool Free Setup. Listed price at this time is $119, but I checked the \"new and open box\" listing and got it for $70. The listing said \"used\" but it was not. This frame was exceptionally well suited as it is a \"platform\" frame, so it supports a mattress without the need for a box spring.",
