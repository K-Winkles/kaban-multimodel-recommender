For the price, I wasn\u2019t expecting much because of how expensive name brand mattresses are, but it\u2019s is crazy comfortable. Easily one of the best mattresses that I have ever bought. I\u2019m going to use this one until it wears out, and then I\u2019ll buy another. If you\u2019re even on the fence, go for it because the value/cost ratio is high on the value end.The packaging was great, they even included a tool specifically for cutting the outer layer of plastic. One of the best purchases I\u2019ve made on Amazon hands down.",

After all packaging was removed we waited 72hrs to fully expand. It was worth the wait of 72hrs. The bed is so comfortable. My husband said, we should order more for other rooms.",

Once received I was not super impressed originally but after a few days of it filling out fully it was much much better! Not sure about Ling term obviously but it's in a guest room so it's not that important. We added a 3\" foam/gel topper and omg! What a difference. My master bedroom is under remodeling so I've spent 5 days sleeping in this bed and its great! Would buy again in a heartbeat",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this mattress in November for my daughters first big girl bed (she\u2019s 4). We went with the 10 inch and purchased a frame as well from Amazon. When the mattress arrived, it came nicely rolled up into a smaller than expected box, but was very heavy. Took my husband and I both to carry it upstairs but that wasn\u2019t surprising seeing as it was a whole full size mattress stuffed into a box. We unboxed it, laid it out in a spare bedroom and cut the plastic to allow it to expand. We did not have any chemical smell like some people mention with these boxed mattresses but we still left it to expand and air out for a few days. By the time we were ready to move it, it was fully expanded and looked like a normal box-store mattress! Moved easily from one room to the other. Normal full/queen sheet set and comforter fit great. After laying on it with my daughter every night for a month, I can definitely say this is a great first mattress for any child! It is definitely firm, so if you are used to a soft bed, this may not be for you (I have a pillow top mattress so I don\u2019t think I could sleep on this full time), but after a month of use I can honestly say my daughter sleeps like a rock on this thing! My favorite feature is that it is a hybrid, so it has coils as well as the foam. The coils allow me to lay in bed with her until she dozes off and let\u2019s me sneak off the bed without any movement or squeaks from the mattress.",

The springs aren't loud, we don't really notice eachother moving around at night and the corners are designed in a way that our sheets never seem to pop off the corners or anything (which was a big issue with our last mattress). The price of the mattress is unmatched, we ended up going for this one over our other top choice of a $1,800 mattress but this one is genuinely the exact same. It doesn't hold heat, it's easy to clean, it's bouncy and lastly the smell leaves really quick. We love it and can't recommend it enough.",
