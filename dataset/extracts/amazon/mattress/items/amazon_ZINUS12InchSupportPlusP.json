                "reviewText": "I bought this in size twin a year ago because I was living in a small room. It was indeed extra firm so I bought a topper and I figured because of the low price it wouldn\u2019t last long. I\u2019ve bought IKEA mattresses (around the same budget) and within 3 months there was sagging/ sinking so I expected to get the same quality but nope. Had this bed for a year and NEVER sagged! Firmness stayed intact and looks like a luxury mattress! Win win.Fast forward a year later, I moved into a bigger place and could buy a bigger mattress so I decided to give away this twin one and spurge on a more expensive mattress. What a mistake that was! I tried the purple ($1100), the winkbed firmest option ( $1300) and both mattress I would sink in and be sleeping in the mattress versus on top. The purple I kind of expected it because it isn\u2019t advertised as firm but I was intrigued by trying a new material. My friend has the purple and loves it but he likes medium firmness. So nothing against Purple, their customer service was fantastic! The mattress has a very interesting feeling when sleeping on it. They do have other more expensive options and their customer service is great so I\u2019d definitely recommend them. Now as for Winkbed, stay away! With their advertised \u201cfirmer mattress\u201d I was sinking in as soon as getting it, I waited days hoping it just hadn\u2019t decompress and nope, it has gotten worse. So bad that I\u2019m taking painkillers everyday to deal with the body aches of sleeping inside the mattress. The company although they advertise a \u201csay nothing and get a refund\u201d I have been emailing them explaining my situation for days, and they have yet to process a refund. They give me copy-and-paste like responses that have nothing to do with my issues like saying it will get softer in time when I\u2019m not saying it is hard, I\u2019m saying I\u2019m sinking in. So how will it getting softer help me? So my experience with Winkbed customer service have been awful. No empathy, no responsibility (think they sent a defective mattress), and not keeping to their word. Also, I tried to leave a review on their website and you can\u2019t. So makes me wonder who can leave reviews on their site? Anywho, stay away.After two failed \u201csplurge\u201d mattress purchases and one awful customer service experience (Winkbed), I decided to go back to the bed that was truly firm! Sometimes the \u201cyou pay what you get for\u201d isn\u2019t true. I got a way better, true to firmness, no sagging price at 1/4 of the cost with this mattress!Save yourself money, if you need a true firm mattress, and get this mattress.Recommend \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I WAS RELUCTANT AT FIRST! I am going to write an unusual review. When we first took the mattress out of the bed and I lay down on it, my first thought was, \"Oh NO! What have I done? This mattress is like laying on a padded brick.\" It took less then 24 hours for the memory foam to completely fluff up. So I gave it another day. And another. It was just SO FIRM! My old bed was like a soft billowy cloud that just wrapped around you. So I called Amazon to check on their return policy. They told me to wait a week and see how I felt, and then we could initiate the return process. I AM SO GLAD I WAITED! I now LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this bed!! Here's why: I SLEEP LIKE A BABY THAT SLEEPS THROUGH THE NIGHT! I have never slept so good in my whole life! I didn't realize it until about 2 weeks went by. I realized, I'm not getting up at night to briefly check the alarm clock time, go to the bathroom etc. No. It is literally a SLEEP MAGNET! I lie down on it, and 5 minutes later, I'm out cold! No more tossing and turning to fall asleep. NO MORE INSOMNIA! I find I am sleeping about exactly 7 hours straight without waking up once.I don't even notice if my husband is beside me in the bed or not. If he moves, I am not aware at all. Even though I was sleeping great,for two weeks I just couldn't seem to part with our old mattress. I kept having doubts like, \"but what if it is just a bit TOO firm? Will I regret tossing our old mattress?\" (It was still in our hall. I know I sound like Goldilocks here, but to be absolutely certain we could trash our old mattress once and for all, I took this mattress off, put it in the hall where our old one was, and put the old one back on. The next two nights were the worse sleep nights of my life.Though my old bed is like falling into a fluffy hammock, I realize now that I have not slept hardly at all for years! No telling how many times I wake up at night! So I switched back again to the Zinus mattress. And I also went ahead and shelled out a little bit more money and added an extra layer of padding with a Sleep Innovations 4-Inch Dual Layer Mattress Topper - Gel Memory Foam and Plush Fiber also found on Amazon ($184.10). That made the bed absolutely PERFECT. Very firm support, but a soft topper. If you have bad back issues, or trouble sleeping this bed is for you! It may be a bit of an adjustment at first, but wait a few days, or add just one more layer of foam as we did. In fact at first, my back was just slightly sore, but that's because it was used to being curved like the letter \"C\" at night. Now every part of my spine is firmly supported, and zero pain anywhere. I am 51 yo, and wake up feeling refreshed. My bed is also on platform risers, and because the bed is perfectly FLAT, it doubles as a workspace (wrapped all our Christmas presents on it). It's easy to fold laundry, etc. because it is firm and perfect height. We both love this bed so much, I hope by next Christmas to replace our Queen size bed in the other bedroom. My 11 yo son loves it too, and now he wishes he could have one too. Conclusion: It may seem to firm at first, but give it a few days. Your body may be readjusting. Now I realize it's the best bed we ever bought! The price is totally reasonable and so convenient having it delivered to your door! PS -- This mattress also has individually wrapped coils, so you don't have to worry about springs going bad and that adds to it's firmness. I think next time, we may try the green tea 10\" memory foam only (no springs) as it reviews as being firm, but probably slightly less than this one. Still, I am a converted believer now in this firm bed.Last thoughts: HOTEL OWNERS/MANAGERS should order these beds! With concern over bedbugs etc., stains etc., these beds are so reasonably priced, you could afford to replace mattresses several times a year if necessary. They are perfect on either platform or boxsprings too. Zinus 12 Inch Performance Plus / Extra Firm Spring Mattress, King",

NO. does it make your sheets baggy? YES.",

                "reviewText": "This mattress is value for money. I was nervous opening it as I have never bought a mattress in a box. I was also worried that it contained CFCs or would off-gas and maybe contain something toxic; but the mattress expanded fully without any issues and I have been using it for about a month. Nice and firm and I sleep right through the night with it; which is why i bought it! The closest comparable mattress is sold by The Brick in Canada, for about $575 including a box spring; or a $299 new mattress and $165 box spring from Salvation Army. Though i didn't want to give Jeff Bezos yet more money, as he has already collected (I would not say earned) more than $78 billion dollars extra during the plandemic, nor the CCP (yes, like everything else the mattress is made in China) I felt there was little option based on value for money.",

                "reviewText": "The bed came earlier than promised. Setting it up was easy for the 2 of us. Took proper shape almost immediately but we let it expand for 1 night before sleeping on it. No odour at all. The price was really good, and so far it is exactly what it claims to be. I've only slept on it for a couple of weeks, and it is very firm, which my husband loves but I am still getting used to. There are no lumps or bumps or uneven places, and the edges are firm, which was important to me - I sleep on my side, usually with an arm hanging over the side of the bed. I didn't want a mattress that I would roll off of lol. I only gave 4 stars because we've only had it for a couple of weeks. I will update when I can give a more relevant review after a few months. But so far, I would recommend this mattress.",
