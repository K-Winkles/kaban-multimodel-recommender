                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the ZINUS 10 Inch Comfort Support Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress, and it has been an absolute game-changer for my sleep quality. I cannot express enough how impressed I am with this mattress.First and foremost, comfort is paramount, and this mattress delivers it in abundance. The combination of memory foam and individually wrapped coils provides the perfect blend of support and contouring to my body. I wake up feeling refreshed and without any aches or pains. It's like sleeping on a cloud!The cooling gel feature is a real game-changer, especially for someone like me who tends to get hot during the night. The gel-infused foam works wonders in regulating the temperature, keeping me cool and sweat-free throughout the night. I no longer have to toss and turn, searching for a cool spot on the bed.In terms of quality, the ZINUS 10 Inch Comfort Support Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress is top-notch. The construction feels solid and durable, and the stitching is flawless. Additionally, the mattress comes with a 10-year warranty, which is a testament to the manufacturer's confidence in their product.Another standout feature is the motion isolation. My partner's movements during the night no longer disturb my sleep, thanks to the individually wrapped coils that absorb and minimize motion transfer. It's truly a blessing for light sleepers or those who share their bed with a restless partner.Setting up the mattress was a breeze. It arrived conveniently compressed in a box, and once unboxed and placed on the bed frame, it expanded to its full size within a few hours. No hassle, no fuss!One minor downside worth mentioning is the initial off-gassing smell that is common with most memory foam mattresses. However, it dissipates within a day or two, and I haven't noticed any lingering odor since.Overall, I highly recommend the ZINUS 10 Inch Comfort Support Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress to anyone in search of a luxurious and supportive sleep experience. Its combination of comfort, cooling technology, and durability make it worth every penny. Trust me, you won't be disappointed with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I recently decided to downsize and get a full sized bed instead of the queen I've had for years. I researched and shopped for maybe 6 months at different retailers. A lady I pet sit for has this same mattress, so decided to order it and give it a try. I have had the mattress about a month now and have been sleeping well on it. It's a medium firm mattress, it does provide comfort and didn't break my budget. My cat and dog also approve of it.",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve been using this mattress for about a month and a half now. For the price we paid I\u2019ve been really really happy with the quality. I was having a lot of back pain sleeping on our old mattress. It was nearly 10 years old and it was definitely time for an upgrade. I was a little skeptical because of the price but I\u2019m really happy. I listen to a lot of the positive reviews. I\u2019ve had no back pain at all since getting his mattress. It\u2019s very supportive, the perfect combination of soft and firm. The only negative I could say, is at the box was delivered and was very badly damaged, so it was difficult to move around and bring inside. Also, if you do sit on the end of the bed, it sinks down a bit and isn\u2019t the most supportive on the very edges. I\u2019m definitely a larger woman and my husband is a little above average. This mattress supportive and has been great for last month and a half. Such a good bargain too!",

We went with the 12 inch so it had more support and cushion. It feels so comfy and cushy to sleep on and looks great on the bed! Highly recommend going with this brand if you want something affordable and it delivers compact so you don\u2019t have to transport yourself!",
