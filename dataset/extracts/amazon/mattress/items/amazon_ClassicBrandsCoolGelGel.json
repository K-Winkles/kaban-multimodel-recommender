        "description": "Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is the latest technology in memory foam mattresses. One layer of 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam draws heat away from your body and allows breathability. The second layer beneath consists of 6 inches of high-density memory foam that conforms to your body providing support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment for a great night's sleep. Perfect for kid\u2019s rooms, college dorms, and guest rooms, this mattress is a great value for any room in the house. Please allow 24 to 72 hours for your Mattress to regain its full shape The Cool Gel 8-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress and it\u2019s adjustable base friendly. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

Smart packaging reduces the carbon footprint in the manufacturers shipping process. Our advanced packaging technology means we can roll-pack our mattresses and ship them at one-third of the normal size. Because of this process, we can ship more mattresses per delivery and reduce the amount of carbon emissions. A mattress that is roll-packed still retains its initial quality, as each will quickly recover and return to its original shape after being removed from its packaging. Quality Assurance The Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is backed with a 10-year worry-free warranty. Look for more innovative specialty sleep products from Classic Brands.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE, 5 YEARS LATER: Its been 5 years now. Still sleeping on this mattress and i still love it, its still very comfortable. To this day, i consider this mattress some of the best money i ever spent. Im happy to see the company is still making them. If you havent bought one yet i really suggest getting one, the mattress is of very high quality and its held up to the abuse of my toddlers, cats, and me sleeping on it filthy from work for years and it still has no odor and looks great. Fantastic value! Will update again in 2021!UPDATE, 4 YEARS LATER: I have now had this mattress for 4 years. It has held up VERY well. There is a slightly noticeable \"slump\" in the mattress in the middle due to use, but like i said you cant really notice it. It is still very comfortable and i still sleep very good on it. FULLY RECOMMENDED to anyone looking for a good cheap mattress that is comfortable. I plan on buying a 2nd one.This mattress takes quite some time to get used to, especially when you have slept on traditional mattresses your entire life. It felt overly firm to me to the point of where it hurt my back for a few weeks, but after it got broken in it was very comfortable. The sour chemical smell coming from it lasted for 4 days, even with a fan blowing on it 24/7 with an open window right next to it. The \"cool gel\" works, i have yet to get overly hot or sweaty sleeping on it. If you are looking for a very cheap mattress thats semi-comfortable and sleeps cool, this one is worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "bought this bed as my old one had become infested with bedbugs. but as someone who lives in florida, the heat can get overwhelming. so i wanted to find something that would relieve me from the daily heat ad humidity. i dont have a ceiling fan in my room and the a/c doesnt seem to cool much. so while i may not experience a \"cooling sensation\" during rest, its much cooler than my previous spring mattress. dont be afraid to buy it though, this thing is a solid purchase. its comfortable, spacious, doesnt make much noise (if you know what i mean), and sturdy enough that it wont let your body sink to the bedframe. set up was a breeze, definitely heavy to lug by yourself unless your a weightlifter i guess. like many other reviews the inflation process was way shorter than 24 hours like it suggests. i set it up at night along with my bedframe and i was sleeping on it the same night. i did wait a couple hours atleast though. there is a smell to the mattress that you can tell is definitely from the material used, its not a disgusting smell, but bearable and goes away in time. some febreeze and airwick can take care of that. the price was unbeatable and it has a 10 year warranty. if you have some extra coin, maybe go with the 10inch, but the 8inch king is just as good. especially in my case where i had a budget. plus i kinda like the lower to the ground beds anyway. almost adds sort of an oriental style to my room. overall, this sure beats going to mattress firm, finding someone with a truck or paying the dudes at the store to drop it off. plus you wont find this kinda price for a king size at one of those places. i would defiitely buy again. hope this helps!",

We let it sit for 2-days after removing the plastic and it expanded really nicely. It feels good to me, but I'm not the one sleeping on it - so far my son absolutely loves the mattress. The tell-tale for me is that he sleeps through the night and has not complained about any discomfort. He tends to sleep hot, but this mattress seems to keep him nice and cool, or at least, it does not heat him up. I'm very happy with this purchase, and when our daughter is ready to graduate from a toddler bed, I will not hesitate to buy another one of these for her.I'd also like to mention that the shipping company got mixed up and practically lost our order. I filed a report through Amazon, and these guys (Classic Brands) handled it quickly, sending me a replacement immediately! 5-Star product and a 5-Star company!",

Es c\u00f3modo, es muy suave, a mi me gusta pero si estas buscando un colch\u00f3n r\u00edgido no es para ti. Adem\u00e1s a muy buen precio comparado con otros de memory foam",

Nunca cre\u00ed poder lograr dormir de una manera tan c\u00f3moda en un colch\u00f3n que no le pide nada a los cl\u00e1sicos de marca. No sientes la presi\u00f3n y se adapta muy bien al cuerpo, adem\u00e1s tiene muy buen soporte.",
