An innerspring mattress contains a coil-based support system, often covered by padding or foam layers, offering a balance of comfort and support. How does coil count affect innerspring mattress quality? Higher coil counts generally provide better support and mattress contouring, but comfort also depends on coil type and mattress layers. What are the common coil systems in innerspring mattresses? Common coil systems include Bonnell, pocketed, continuous, and offset coils, each offering distinct support and feel. Can innerspring mattresses support side sleepers? Yes, innerspring mattresses with plush tops or added foam layers can offer pressure relief suitable for side sleepers. Do innerspring mattresses require a box spring? While not always required, a box spring can extend an innerspring mattress's life by providing even support and preventing sagging.",
