                "reviewText": "I had purchased the plush Lucid mattress for my other house & that one was PERFECT. Needed another mattress & for some reason could not ship the plush to Hawaii. But the medium mattress could be shipped, so I went with that. If you are reading this then you know mattresses are a very personal choice. How can a mattress feel like sleeping in a cloud & also feel like sleeping on a slab of concrete? Is there truly that much difference in 2 people\u2019s experience? Or is it quality control of the memory foam? At any rate, I had a good experience with Lucid once. And had a bad experience with a different brand where the new mattress had zero support & gave me back pain like I\u2019ve never experienced before. It also was so hot! And if you get the mattress & don\u2019t like it, good luck getting it back into the box & returning it! I ended up selling it to some poor soul that didn\u2019t know what a torture thing the mattress was. But hey, there were a gazillion 5 star reviews on that brand. Maybe the buyer got an almost brand new \u201clike sleeping on a cloud in an inferno\u201d for a fraction of the price!Anyways, back to this medium support Lucid. It\u2019s OK. I wake up with ZERO back pain & does not retain heat, so maybe it does deserve a 5 star instead of 4 star. But, I just wish it had a tad bit more softness. Like maybe one or two more inches of soft memory foam. I\u2019ve had it for a couple months. I am hoping as it breaks in it will soften up a bit. This mattress is probably good for people larger than I. And I sleep alone with a couple little furry friends. I tried putting a 3\u201d memory foam mattress topper on it but it was too much, a little too soft. Maybe a 1\u201d or 2\u201d topper will work. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really do like this mattress. No back pain is worth a lot!!! This mattress is almost perfect! I would have traded the plush for this medium, but he let the old dog sleep on it with no waterproof protection & guess what? He can keep it! Also, the softer they are the faster they degrade. That plush mattress\u2026 the person sleeping on it is about 30-40lbs heavier than me. He\u2019s been sleeping on it for 5 years & its has an indentation where he sleeps. But he has not complained about that. He does complain about the fact that there\u2019s no support at the edges when you sit. That is true for any memory foam mattress. He ended up putting padded side boards on his bed frame to give it support (my bed frame already has side boards, which is perfect for memory foam!) I really wish I could have ordered the plush Lucid, even if I would have to replace it in 5 years. For the price, to me, it\u2019s worth it. That plush mattress was perfect, this medium is almost perfect & since it is firmer, hopefully it will last a little longer. Good luck with the search for the perfect mattress! If you can afford to pay a little more, buy one at Costco or somewhere that you can return it if it doesn\u2019t work for you. Or go to a mattress store & take a lie down on different brands. Or lie down on a friend\u2019s memory foam & see how it feels. There\u2019s just no way to know, since every mattress on Amazon has contradictory reviews. I do believe that if you are not sure, go with the firmer one. If it\u2019s too firm, you can always put a topper on it. But if it\u2019s too soft & causes crippling pain & makes you feel like you are sleeping in an inferno of heat, you are pretty much screwed. I do recommend this medium Lucid mattress. It is a good mattress at an affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "So my girlfriend had an old queen size box spring mattress that was in terrible shape. When we moved in together, we brought her bed with. The mattress kept getting worse and worse so we ended up going to both several chain and local mattress stores. The cheapest we could find for a basic queen size memory foam mattress was $700.We bought this, somewhat hesitant about buying an off brand mattress from Amazon. We left it to inflate for 4 days before sleeping on it and it was so comfy, not too hard and not too soft. Just right! We then put a plastic mattress protector/cover on the mattress to protect it from spills, etc.Shortly after that, we noticed the bed wasn\u2019t very soft or comfy anymore, almost too hard. We thought that the mattress had finally showed it\u2019s true colors and we were a little upset.On a whim, we removed the mattress protector/bag and all of a sudden, the mattress was super comfy again. Lesson learned!So don\u2019t put a mattress protector on the mattress and it will be fine. Just don\u2019t spill anything on it, although the mattress does have a cloth cover that goes over the foam that\u2019s removable.",

I like soft and cushy (soggy?) beds and I should have looked for something that was truly plush. That being said, we have a few of the Lucid mattresses at our lake home and they were great value for the money and have held up well. So this was a no brainer- the mattress arrived on time and I let it inflate and air out for about three days. No toxic odor or off gassing. Overall, it\u2019s great, just not as soft as I would have liked. The word \u2018plush\u2019 isn\u2019t really an accurate descriptor. I might buy a down feather bed topper and see if that helps. Other than that, the bed is good and I\u2019m sleeping ok.",
