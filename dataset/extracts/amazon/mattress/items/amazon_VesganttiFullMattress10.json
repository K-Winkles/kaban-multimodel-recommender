                "reviewText": "I was initially hesitant to buy a mattress online, sight-unseen - especially at such a low price. Let's face it, you probably wouldn't have high expectations for a mattress that costs less than $200, right?Here's the deal: cash is tight. I've gone back to school and so I've got to be scrappy and pinch every penny I have. So when it became painfully clear (literal pain in my back!) that my old mattress needed to be replaced, I went on an exhaustive search for options - and \"exhaustive\" is no exaggeration. Here are the criteria I used:1) Has to be a bed in a box - didn't want to pay delivery/setup fee and didn't want weird strangers tromping around my bedroom2) Has to be less than $5003) Has to be a spring/foam hybrid4) Has to be a size/weight I can manage myself (I am a 42-year-old woman of slightly higher than average physical fitness)If you look around Amazon, you will see that there are a LOT of mattresses that fall under those criteria, so I had to narrow it down. This is where I really need to thank my fellow Amazon consumers for their thoughtful, detailed reviews, because it made my task a lot easier. So.. thanks! :) I will attempt now to do the same.The bed arrived four days early, which was a nice surprise. I came home, and the box was laying on my front patio. I think the UPS person must have struggled with it, because one of the flaps on the end was missing/ripped off. If I had one critique, that would be it: the box this thing ships in would be lots easier to manage if it had handles of some sort. Lacking handles, it's pretty unwieldy. As it is, I'm a pretty crafty gal, so I flipped the box end-over-end through my front door, through the foyer, and up my stairs (three sets total, two landings) to my bedroom. (An aside: I lift weights. Heavy ones. Regularly. It's good for you, and you should do it, too, so you can heft heavy mattresses around by yourself without injury.)Getting the mattress to metamorphose from its brilliantly vac-wrapped sausage form to its final flat mattress state was a bit of a trick. The mattress is wrapped in a few layers of thick plastic; included with the mattress is a handydandy thing that looks just like the letter opener on my desk at work. I helped myself to it, and I guess maybe I accidentally poked a hole in the innermost plastic layer as I was cutting the plastic, because the mattress started to expand before I was ready for it! I could hear the air hiss as it was being sucked into the package, so I hurried to finish removing the plastic. The mattress unfurled, and I watched as the product of modern technology unfolded before my eyes.In the span of about ten minutes, the mattress had expanded to near-full capacity. I was shocked! I was also mightily curious about what it felt like. So - I laid down on it for a brief minute... just to see. It was GLORIOUS. It had give while still being supportive. It squished, but the springs have just the right amount of pushback. I was excited! :) BUT - I also am good at delaying gratification, so - per directions - I let the mattress sit for 24 hours to finish any additional expansion. I'm not real sure if it did, to be honest - It really looked to me like it expanded to full size easily within one hour - but I didn't want to mess anything up by not following directions.I've slept on the mattress a few days now, and I can say that this is, without a doubt, the most comfortable mattress I have ever owned. It is perfect for me - it's firm, but it has give, so even sleeping on my side is comfortable. It's also very well made; all the ticking and the stitching is straight, well-done, and solid.I will, of course, update my review if, over the course of time, something goes awry... but for now, I am a very happy and satisfied customer, and I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone looking for quality and comfort on a budget. Shoot, even if it only lasts for a few years, at $200, I'm still ahead of the game!",

                "reviewText": "Where do I start...Ok, right here, Freaking AWESOME mattress. I searched Amazon for mattresses for my camp cabin, and read quite a few reviews on different seller's mattresses and ultimately settled on this one, and glad I did. Let me start by saying, I was somewhat skeptical when I read the part, \" this mattress comes rolled up in a cardboard box\" which to me defy's all logics and physics, especially noting the mattress is over 9\" thick and had metal coil springs. I'm thinking this could be the 8th wunder of the world. So I ordered it. Let me say that about 10 yrs ago I bought one of those new style pillow top King size BRAND name mattress from a major mattress store here locally, and I paid over $1200.00 for it. It was a total waste of money and piece of junk. The mattress dipped so much in the middle, hip area, I could have used it for a Chinese Wok. Never one night of good sleep, ever. Just pain, aches , duscomfort, etc for both me and my wife. Naturally store would not refund our money or even swap for another. So now for my cabin. Deciding to build a set of bunk beds and knowing dimensions of this Twin XL, I got to work while mattress was in shipment. I had lumber dry stacked from Amish sawmill, cut all my lumber to size, ran it thru planer, sanded it, and put it together. The mattress arrived in the cardboard box about 44\" tall by about 14\"x14\", and I was still scratching my head, thinking there is a Twin XL mattress inside here....okayyyyy. Removed from the box, and that rolled up mattress was about 12\" in diameter. Still thinking , no way. So I laid the coil on the bunk bed base, removed the endless plastic wrap that encased the mattress to prevent it from uncoiling like a cobra snake. Now I could see the white mattress all coiled up in yet was it's final vacuum wrap. Now I'm thinking what wall am I going to end up getting tossed against when I break the vacuum seal on this puppy. I carefully broke the seal cutting a four inch piece off of the corner and watched the magic happen. That thing sucking air to expand sounded like a small jet engine. Took about I'd say a couple minutes and that think was full size as pictured. My first thought was I'm really impressed, my second thought , I guess I'm keeping this, because there is no way in hell this is going back in that box. The only comparison and amazement I can say is that this is like when you see a model sailing clipper ship inside of one of those glass jugs, or 12 clowns exiting a VW Beetle at the circus. Didn\u2019t sleep the first night at all hardly, all I wanted to do is lay there awake and feel how great this mattress was.. omgggggg, unbelievable. No more aches, no lower back pain, no discomfort. I had ordered the Twin XL, because I'm 6'4\" and 220 lbs, so I wanted a long enough mattress. To think that I spent or wasted $1200 on a King pillow top mattress and I could have bought two of these, side by side on the box springs for about $300 or less. In the picture I built the long runs for the bunk beds out of 2x6 cut to 84\" long. To support the mattress I cut the Amish wood 1\"x 8's and 1\"x10\" boards to 40\" long which allowed a half inch clearance on either side of the mattress. Just note here the mattress is like they describe a touch on the firm side but very comfortable. Sleep like a baby. My opinion you cannot go wrong with this mattress it's fantastic.UPDATE: So I built a set of bunk beds but only ordered one of these mattress's on about Sept20th 2020, instead of two and then may be become disappointed and try to return both. So as it turns out the mattress is fine so three weeks later Oct 15th I went back on Amazon here where I bought the first one to buy the exact, identical, mattress and was sticker shocked at the dramatic price increase. I had paid $139 for the first one, BUT for me to buy it again three weeks later I would now have to pay $169....$30 more, not $5 or maybe $ 10, but $30 more which instantly made me browse for a different mattress. I may share some of the guilt as I had only praise and good things to say about this mattress. Now with a bitter taste in my mouth I can only say I would NOT recommend this mattress and to look elsewhere for better pricing. So much for customer appreciation. Oh well",

Bought a twin that was 10\" deep. Arrived early. Very easy to open. Allowed mattress to rest 24 hours before setting it on her bed. Also separately bought a waterproof bed liner for obvious reasons from another site. This bed has made such a difference in my mothers life. She used to complain about back pain frequently. This has all but stopped. She has come to me several times to say the support of the mattress gives enough to be comfortable, but firm enough to keep her back straight. She loves it. Thank you so much!",
