                "reviewText": "So, about 3 years ago my wife and I were suckered into buying a $6,000 mattress at a retail mattress store. \"We are going to spend a 3rd of our life on this thing - so it needs to be a really good one\" was our thinking. Well, it *was* a really good mattress - it was just too soft. And after 3 years of use, it was even softer.... starting about 6 months ago, both of us were waking up with significant back pain every day. Then we went on vacation for a couple weeks and I noticed that both of our back pain went away. \"It's our mattress!\" I thought. I turned to Amazon and found this thing... and at this price - I thought, \"I'm gonna try it! - what do I have to lose?\" Well, that was about 3 weeks ago.... and I am here to tell you, that this is NOT as nice as the $6,000 mattress - BUT IT IS PRETTY DANG NICE. And, most importantly, our back pain is gone. My wife says \"there is no way this thing will last at that price\" - and I say \"WHO CARES!\" if I have to buy a new one every year, it's still way cheaper than most mattresses! And I am pretty sure this will last longer than a year. It *is* well made and very comfortable. We did not wait the recommended 24 hours or 36 hours or whatever, we opened it and waited about an hour. Put the bedding on.... and hit the sack! We've been sleeping great ever since. Really. It's a great mattress, don't let the low cost fool you.IMPORTANT NOTE: MY WIFE AND I ARE BOTH 165 LBS OR LESS. So... if you are \"big\" - your mileage may vary.",

                "reviewText": "Update: The seller was quick to respond to me. They told me to measure the height from the middle of the bed rather than the edges. I haven't been able to do that because my bed been set up and covered with a padded mattress protector since I got it. They offered to send me a foam topper if I still had an issue.I bought this mattress because I had a memory foam mattress previously that was just too hot and firm for me. This mattress sleeps much cooler! I don't wake up in a sweat.The springs are good and provide nice support. I used to wake up with stiff or painful hips/lower back. That is significantly better too.I didn't think I would recommend this bed at all. But it's actually quite nice. Especially for the price.Previous review: I got this product 3.5 days ago. I opened the package within 2 hrs of its delivery. I allowed 72 hrs for it to expand. I ordered the 12in mattress so it would have more cushion and be less firm than the 10 in. It expanded to 11 inches at most. The information included in the package says the product may very up to 1.5inches, which seems like alot.The springs go all the way to the top. The picture led me to believe that the springs would stop at the first seam and would have a good layer foam on top of that. The foam is very thin. This is essentially a spring mattress. Not a hybrid mattress.I have yet to sleep on it, since I was letting it expand, but it feels very firm and lacks padding to soften the spring pressure.I will be contacting the seller as soon as I figure out how.I will update after I sleep on it and get more information from the seller.",

I like the way it molds to your body and gives enough bounce so you're not sinking in like memory foam mattresses. I love the coils and it's plush enough and firm enough. Probably right in the middle. I aired it out without any smell for about 6hrs. It was fine to sleep on that night. I highly recommend this mattress if you're seeking a peaceful sleep.",

I've been getting way better sleep, and waking up comfortable instead of with back/arm/leg pains like I used to. And the animals, especially the dog who couldn't fit in the old bed with us, are all ecstatic to be able to cuddle at night now :) Even if this mattress gives out in a few years it will have been worth it because of how affordable and how comfortable it is. If/when we need to replace it, we'll probably order this one again!",

                "reviewText": "Taking away a star only because the mattress did not expand to the full 10\u201d which was very disappointing since I very specifically looked for a certain height mattress. We let it expand undisturbed for 72+ hours and it maxed out at just under 9\u201d. Other than that, I\u2019m actually quite pleased with it. The mattress is the perfect blend of softness and support with a bit of spring. My partner moves a lot during the night and there is minimal motion transfer, and it doesn\u2019t collapse when you sit on the edge. A fantastic mattress for the price and feels like it will last many years!",
