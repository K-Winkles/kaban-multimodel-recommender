                "reviewText": "Bought this as a cheap full mattress to throw on the floor in my son's bedroom. He's 20 months old and we're having issues with getting him to sleep alone in his crib. So my wife and I often have to go in and cosleep with him, and if we want to sleep in our own bed we have to wait for him to pass out then sneak out. A mattress on the floor seemed like the easiest safest way to let him sleep outside the crib.Unfortunately this thing has been giving off a pretty terrible chemical odor, even after having 3 weeks to air out. My wife can't stand it, feels it's probably not too healthy, and wants it out of the house....Now I'm stuck trying to return a mattress to Amazon which is a nightmare. Spend a little extra money and buy a slightly better mattress locally.",
