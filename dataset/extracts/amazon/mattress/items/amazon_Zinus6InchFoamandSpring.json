It\u2019s been a week now since I\u2019ve bought it and I let it air out for 24 hours, etc but it still smells. The smell has taken over my whole bedroom, and at what cost? Certainly not the cost of a goods night sleep.I wish I had not bought this mattress.",

Springs creak when you move which woke me up several times. It reminds me of the old mattress I replaced with this one. Beware there is no real foam layer and you can feel every spring. Definitely not a hybrid mattress like the other one I got. This one is like a trampoline with the springs.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this mattress for my 4 year old daughter. She really needed a new one!Pros:1. It came packaged extremely well! Almost vacuumed sealed, in a way. Be careful when you're opening the packaging, and ensure all young children and pets are not nearby, as it unravels with some force. Even I had to move back a bit!2. It's comfortable, and slightly buoyant. It's extremely attractive as well. I almost fell asleep on my baby girl's bed!!3. My daughter will undoubtedly be able to grow into this bed. I can tell it was made to last. She can have this mattress for years to come!4. The price is pretty good, for what it is!Cons:1. Shipping. I requested for this mattress to be delivered to me the day after I ordered it, since I'm a Prime member. That did not happen. Puralator gave SO many issues. Claiming they tried to deliver when they definitely didn't. I ended up having to pick it up at a local Puralator Depot, 3 days after it was supposed to be delivered. Extremely inconvenient. I had to take a Uber there, and a taxi back, since it comes in a pretty big and long box. Puralator has long since been known for horrendous service. So, I'm not saying everyone will have this experience. I live in a building, if that helps anyone. I know it's the Holiday Season but if I chose a package to be delivered the day after, it should be!! Amazon compensated me for my troubles.2. The mattress does have a strong smell. Not a disgusting smell, but a prominent NEW smell. I'd be good to let it air out for a while, in the bedroom with an open window. My fiance loved the smell. He said this is what a new mattress should smell like. I laughed, but since it's for our 4 year old, we decided to let it air out a bit.All in all, I truly love this mattress for my daughter. Her eyes lit up when she saw it. She knew she was getting a new bed, so she was definitely anticipating it, but when I walked through the door with the box, and when she saw the actual mattress with her own eyes, I felt so happy to see she was happy! We won't have to worry about getting her a new bed for YEARS now, which is awesome. I recommend this bed for anyone that has children (4-5 years and up, I would say), single people, students/professionals, etc. If you're thinking about getting this bed for you and your partner, I'd wish against that. The bed is good for maybe 2 kids at a time, or just 1 adult. But two adults at a time would be very uncomfortable and cramped. I wish you all enjoy your new purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I needed an upgrade for my old bed, eventually I found this and decided to try it, for the price I was skeptical but honestly I am super surprised!I wanted to downgrade to a Twin since I needed more room, it came vacuum sealed in a box, and rather light. Just make sure to open it away from anything, somewhere empty, while mine did not there is a chance it can shoot open and injure someone!But the price to comfort ratio is insane. I was going into this purchase thinking its not really going to be very worth the price but would suffice for the time until I could save up for a expensive bed but honestly, I don't see me getting rid of this anytime soon.Its comfortable, can't say I had any bad sleeps on it, it does come with springs. Almost a decade ago now I used to sleep on some cheap queen spring mattress and it was awful, it had only been a few months old and it was SUPER squeaky, like unbearable with every little movement. But this mattress is very quiet!Also seems like it does not matter if you sleep on your side, back or stomach, all are comfortable!So should you get it? Sure! If you are looking for something temporary or even a long term, this will easily do the job no problem! Maybe there are some better mattresses for the same or similar price, but if you just need something that will be nice to sleep on this will do just fine!",
