I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but this was exactly what I was looking for to provide firm (but still comfortably soft) support.Out of the box, the top layer of foam did look rumpled and lumpy beneath the mattress cover. But by the end of the first night, everything was settled and smooth. (Make sure to let it unroll and rise fully in one place before trying to move it - I think trying to move it while it was expanding was my mistake.)After just one night, I feel morerested than I have in years of sleeping in memory foam and soft \u201chybrid\u201d mattresses. It doesn\u2019t seem to sleep hot - I\u2019m like a space heater but this passed the sweat test in a 74\u00b0 room. Dry and comfortable all night.For my weight, this mattress is great in any sleep position: side, stomach and back all feel natural. It has just enough sink so that my behind is flush with my spine if I\u2019m on my back, which no mattress has ever managed to do for me before. If you\u2019re on the lighter side, this might not be the same for you, but again, just speaking for my own size.The quilted top doesn\u2019t have large divots like some mattresses, and the top layer of foam is just thick enough to feel plush without the marshmallow/quicksand feel of the Zinus memory foam mattresses. Great edge support too - sleeping on my side it felt stable right up to the edge. I wouldn\u2019t sit on it to put my shoes on, though\u2026 it smashes flat under my weight in a sitting position.All in all, an extraordinary mattress for the price, and one I hope to keep for years. Hope this helps, big dudes!",

                "reviewText": "Had to replace my mattress because the dog peed on it >.<. I bought Zinus before for my guest room and knew it was good for the price. I admit being a bit sad because my old mattress was really nice quality and very comfortable- I thought Serta? Beautyrest? But needs must, so I bought the Queen Zinus. As I was removing the old mattress I checked the tag- And it was ZINUS!!! Sure enough, swapped the mattresses, and no change in quality of sleep!",

                "reviewText": "To anyone considering this mattress-I highly recommend! It is a very good bed for a very good price! It is soft yet firm I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sleeping on a hardwood floor but I also don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sinking. It has a bit of a firm memory foam feel. The only reason why I\u2019m giving four stars is because the sides are a little weak. My husband and I both don\u2019t weigh very much, I am 125 pounds and he\u2019s about 141- so it\u2019s fine. But I imagine if someone had a lot of weight to them and they sat on the edge of the bed, they would feel like they would slide off.However a little bit of annoying the sides might be, it is not a dealbreaker! This is a really good bed! Super good quality!!!Don\u2019t be intimidated when it comes and there\u2019s a huge bubble in the middle that lasts for about three days, not a big deal, it goes away. And I highly recommend giving it the 72 hours to completely come to its size. Happy sleeping!!!",

                "reviewText": "Me and the hubs love this mattress...it came very quickly (2 days after we ordered) 8am in the morning. Had no trouble getting it unboxed, enjoyed the directions so much...perfect for my hubs. We had so things to do that Saturday so once we got it on top of our box springs we headed out for the day. When we returned 5 hours later the mattress looked perfect, we put sheets, blankets and pillows on it. It had filled out completely no bumps or sags...it looked very inviting. So a few hours later we were finally ready to try our new mattress out...it is firmer than I expected which is not a bad thing. I have some major nerve pain issues due to a former tumor on my spine. Laying down is never comfortable for me so I wasn't expecting much. My hubs twists and turns and has 6 pillows he uses to prop himself up with in various ways. The first night was different, I slept, I woke at 5am to take meds and realized that was the first time I had waken all night...the hubs said he slept great, but he always says that and can sleep anyplace. Thought I'd give it some time, so here we are a month later...I am definitely sleeping better, and waking up feeling rested. I actually get comfortable at night. Hubs is down to using 2 pillows, he says the firmer mattress gives more support and he doesn't need the pillows now. We are very pleased. By the way, hubs is a big guy 6'4, 350lbs, before when he roll over I knew it, now I don't even notice. It's very nice, we are very pleased. I wasn't sure about a mattress that came in a box but it's wonderful. We are going to purchase another for our son. We love it, definitely recommend it to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new bed for an apartment, where do I start? One friend recently found a good deal at mattress firm and another friend bought a zinus mattress from Amazon. I went to mattress firm to see what was there and it waaay out of budget. So went to my friends house to check out here bed and it was nice. I could not believe what came from a box... So I tried to order the same but it was out of stock and I needed one asap... So I purchased this one, same company as hers.The box arrived in decent shape. It was heave, but not as heavy as the frame I ordered to go with it. I let the mattress decompress after opening it for 2 days. I had back surgery a few years ago, I life a firm mattress. This one is not as firm as I would think I want, but it more than firm enough. Medium plus. I have no issues sleeping on it. The middle edge will sink some when you sit on it, getting up this morning I notices... But the ends are firm and the corners are firm. The mattress makes no noise from the springs or anything. From sleeping to other things you do on a bed, I have no complaints.I was on the fence, waited around, worried about me messing up my back more being cheap. That was not the case. I am actually very, very happy and surprised with the bed. I give it 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations. I am sleeping comfortably and do not feel bad about my purchase. I let my budget lead and this time, it was right. Makes me really think about the overpriced mattress market. The other really expensive mattresses are nice, but you will pay 8 times or more what I paid here for one. I have no regrets and WILL buy again.",
