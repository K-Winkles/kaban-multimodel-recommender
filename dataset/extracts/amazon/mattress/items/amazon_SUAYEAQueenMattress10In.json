It opened up to full form in a short amount of time and we were able to put it on the bed and make it up shortly after opening it. Its a bit heavy but so much easier to get up to the 2nd floor because it comes compacted in a smaller box. Shipping was fast, price was fair...definitely would purchase again and highly recommend",

I ordered a 10\u201d, and left it on the frame for at least 4 days before anyone was even allowed to enter the room. Lol. But it still never fully rose (see pic). It\u2019s about a month and a half later now. It\u2019s still only 8\u201d. But it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s comfortable, it hasn\u2019t lost its form in any area, and it serves its purpose. I don\u2019t regret the purchase. Just order a size up from what you really want. Oh, and it inflated almost immediately. Like, I had to step back because I didn\u2019t expect it to inflate that quickly. But we still didn\u2019t touch it for several days. Also, there was no smell at all. Everything was great except the 2\u201d loss.",

I'm 36 years old with a few old sports injuries, I used to wake up with aching hips and a kink in my neck, but with this mattress I've had the best sleep of my life and zero pain. We've had it for about six months now. Zero complaints.",

I was aware of that from other reviews so I ordered the 12\u201d instead of a smaller one.Overall, for around $200 it\u2019s good enough for now.",
