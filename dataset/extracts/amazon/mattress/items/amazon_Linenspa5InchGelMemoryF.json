                "reviewText": "Ok. So I'm one of those people that absolutely suck at buying big purchases like new mattresses when they're clearly needed. I tend to just sleep on the old original, make due, suffer, and complain about it every waking hour..I want to first admit. I did get a discount on this one. Not sure how, just put it in my cart and it was cheaper than what the list price was. Might have been a credit from Amazon I wasn't aware of at the time..So I bought it anyways.First the packaging is awesome. Came in a really small box vacuum sealed with 2 layers of plastic.Remove from box, remove first plastic. 'roll it out', remove second plastic, and watch it expand right before your eyes..It DOES take about 24hrs for it to fully expand. Do not be discouraged. The middle portion expands fast, but the ends (head and foot) do take a little extra time but it's not a big deal honestly.. Give it time!First I sat on it, and it was amazing! Firm, but plush against me, supported but didn't push back so much I was uncomfortable. Then I laid on it. Super firm for the first couple seconds, but once your body sinks into it it really does add great support, but cradles at the same time..It's firm for support, but plush enough to still cradle you like a softy.. Best of both worlds.First sleep.. Now. I've had chronic sleep problems, and severe pain for years, and I really believe it was due to bad sleep on an older spring mattress that's seen better days.. I'd toss, turn, wake up over and over. and though I was laying down for 8-10hrs. I was probably only actually asleep for 2 of those nightly. Life sucked! (although I'm sure the chiropractor enjoyed all the visits)First sleep on this mattress. I slept through the night, turned over once and woke up fine. Sat up. did my morning twist and turn, snappity, crackity, pop. stretched out and actually felt muscles stretching and not just bone/joints grinding.. After about a week. (because there's no miracle pill) I lost 90% of my chronic pain. Because I'm sleeping through the night, not tossing and turning constantly, and the mattress is supporting me no matter my angle.I would 100% recommend this, and other products by this company.. It's cheap! (I mean inexpensive), well worth the money, it comes in different firmness's, and trust me. Your body will love you..",

We needed something better than an air mattress and something we could hide away. This worked out to be the perfect floor bed. We added a 2 inch memory foam mattress topper on top of it along with a fitted sheet. It\u2019s pretty comfortable in this configuration - firm enough to lounge on and read, but also cushiony and supportive enough to sleep on for the week our guest spent with us during a winter storm. Our guest reported it was so comfortable, they would like to order a similar one for their first apartment. This mattress immediately came to life and expanded to full size right out of the box. There was no smell. We began using it 24 hours later. It is light enough than I can move it from room to room. Great solution!",

                "reviewText": "(The names have been changes to protect the hilarity, but this review is based on true events and the sentiment is 100% accurate.)A DAY IN THE LIFE of my husband Jude and I these days consists of work, work, and renovating our home. Seems like EIGHT DAYS A WEEK we are burning the midnight oil and A HARD DAYS NIGHT. Things are GETTING BETTER, but most days I just want to scream for HELP! We recently ordered two Linenspa 5-inch gel mattresses to go with a daybed with trundle for the BOYS room BECAUSE all other mattresses we found were so expensive! These ones were an incredible price. I know you CAN'T BUY ME LOVE but I thought if these worked out, I might argue that point. YESTERDAY we received our order (on a Sunday, an entire day before our scheduled delivery date). My husband took the boxes out and started pulling at the plastic. I yelled, HEY JUDE, LET IT BE! OH! DARLING. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I told him I'LL BE BACK (because I read the very clear and very short instructions that accompanied our \"mattress taquito\") and went to get scissors. They easily slid through the plastic and the mattress unfolded. My husband was confused (since he didnt read the instructions) and began smooshing the mattress. I said, HONEY DONT. Just WAIT. Within 15 minutes the mattress was almost fully decompressed. The TWO OF US took turns trying it out. The cover was really impressive and soft to touch. The mattress felt great and held my husband and I both with no issue. I cleaned up a bit and went upstairs and an hour later I came back down and my husband is still on this mattress! I said, WHAT YOU'RE DOING is not okay. That's for the boys. He replied, I'M ONLY SLEEPING. I'M SO TIRED. All I could do was tell him GOOD NIGHT. I received NO REPLY.P.S. I LOVE YOU(Very impressed with packaging, performance, and price. I would entirely recommend this product and will actually be coming back to look at their higher end mattresses in the future.)",
