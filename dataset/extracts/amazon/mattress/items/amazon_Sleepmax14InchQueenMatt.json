                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about buying a mattress online and having it delivered flattened and rolled up . But now to my surprise, I think I'm in love with a mattress! Really, this has got to be the best mattress I've had in my 60 year adult life. I am really enjoying my sleep, so much so that I begin taking naps again. At one point I thought I would have to go see a doctor about my back, now I wake up with absolutely no back pain. This May sound exaggerated but believe me I rarely give anything 5 stars. It took me a minute to get used to the memory foam, initially if it felt like I was crawling out of a hole in the morning. Once it found out it was heat activated I realized I could adjust the firmness by adding another sheet. Now it's dang near perfect. I've only had it for about 6 weeks so I can't speak to its durability. But for now, I would highly recommend this matchers especially if you are a large person and sleep on your side.",

                "reviewText": "I had high expectations for this mattress, but within just two months of purchasing the bed, we noticed that, upon assembling it, it started to sink significantly. Despite both of us weighing relatively little, with 176 lbs and 112 lbs respectively, the mattress sags excessively in the center, creating a sensation akin to an deflated mattress. Unfortunately, this situation has resulted in waking up with back pain, making the sleeping experience uncomfortable and unsatisfactory. It is regrettable to lose the money invested in this purchase, as we believe it to be a low-quality product.",
