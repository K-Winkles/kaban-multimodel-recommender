                "reviewText": "alot of people said they feel the springs when they lay down and as of right now i dont feel any springs at all. i also weigh 150 so im not exactly a heavier person however i am more then average. i do think if someone whos on the heavier side layed on this they would feel the springs though, i haven\u2019t slept a night in it but i will be updating every month and the first night i sleep on it. i only layed on it for a few seconds and it seems to support my weight really good . no sinking and i dont feel springs , it feels comfortable and has a little bounce to it which i don\u2019t mind. the only thing im worried about is the durability and longevity of this mattress. the corners have absolutely no support so if u sit on the corner you\u2019re going to be sitting on basically nothing, which is why im worried of the durability of it . however i will update along the way as stated. *UPDATE* so its been like 3 months and its still holding up good . i have no issues as of right now. i don\u2019t still don\u2019t wake up in pain since i ordered this mattress, not much to update on right now. everything seems to be okay still.",

                "reviewText": "Update - I liked the height of my bed frame and the mattress collectively. However, I wanted is a little higher, so I added highers and magically the edges are much firmer. I sit in the edge of the bed all the time now and no problems. This was my only issue, so this mattress gets a solid 5!Original Review:This is my first box mattress, and I had no idea what to expect. My colleague helped me set it up, and it was actually super easy. In fact, the hardest part was taking off the plastic lol! I wish we had did a video, but not knowing what to expect we were focused on just getting it set up.Please note it is heavy, nothing light about it. Also if it's not delivered directly to your home, you'll need a vehicle where the seats let down because it won't fit across the back seat.Now once we got the plastic off, and started unrolling it, it immediately started to rise. It looked like it fully inflated right away; but I like to follow directions, so I gave it the full weekend to settle before actually sleeping on it. There was no odd smell or anything.Now, I have horrible back issues, so I had explored reviews that suggested the mattress had good back support, and this one had several mentions of back pain relieve. Maybe my back issues are too extreme, but I haven't seen any real relieve. (I made another purchase to try and address this).However, I love the size of the mattress, and beyond my back I find it to be very comfortable.Now I don't like the lack of firmness around the edges, which appears to be extremely weak. Whenever I sit on the edge of the bed I feel like I'm going to fall off. The rest of the mattress is actually pretty firm. I feel well supported. NOTE: it doesn't hurt my back anymore than what I experienced before. If it wasn't for the issues with the edges I would give this mattress 5 Stars. I really like it!",

                "reviewText": "The bed is MOSTLY fantastic. Was easy to unpack, feels great to sleep on. Only problem is you CANNOT sit on the edges. They are filled with cotton candy or something. The bed is firm, but it's on a frame that has drawers underneath. When trying to sit on the edge of the bed, you basically sink down to the frame or fall off. So if you don't sit on the edge of your bed, no worries. If you do sit on the edge of your bed for reasons, this may be something to consider. Overall a very solid value.",

My back usually hurts a lot on any mattress I sleep while sleeping and after getting up but not after this one! I bought this mattress for a guest bedroom and decided to try it out and now I just want to throw away my own heavenly bed mattress and get another one for my own bed! The mattress is very supportive but not stiff, my body sang with pleasure and gratitude when I I was laying on it or turning on it I didn\u2019t want to get up! Best purchase ever!!!!",

                "reviewText": "We got this mattress for use with a new \"Murphy\" pull-down wall bed for guests who need a bed that is, e.g., more comfortable than a typical air mattress, and yet just as easily gotten out of the way when our guests leave. We had no prior experience with any kind of boxed mattress, and really had no idea what to expect when we got it. All I knew is that I wanted a 10-inch mattress that didn't cost a fortune, and which combined sealed coil springs with a multi-layered foam/gel top. This one was the perfect combination of our desired features, size and price. The mattress comes compressed in a vacuum-sealed bag that's then tightly rolled up end-to-end (so the finished length of the coiled mattress is the same as the width of whatever size mattress you've ordered). You uncoil the wrapped mattress; lay it on the bedframe with the coil side facing down; open up the sealed vacuum bag, and WHOOSH ... the mattress miraculously expands to its full thickness. That sight alone was practically worth buying the thing. Then you just wait a few days for all the internal materials to complete their re-expansion, and you have what I consider to be a REALLY nice and surprisingly firm/consistent sleep surface ... and I'm pretty fussy about mattresses. If you want to go one extra step for your/your guests' comfort, you can add a topper, but for our particular use/needs, this thing is perfectly useable/comfortable \"out of the box,\" and a great value. Very pleased!",
