I was expecting to have to be home for the bed to arrive thinking it was going to be this giant mattress \u2026 but it\u2019s compressed into a small 4\u2019 by 3\u2019 box. It is heavy for the average person\u2026 I just tossed it side to side into the house. Then I carefully cut the plastic to air it out\u2026it says don\u2019t air it out in your room and leave 24 hours for it to form to its size \u2026 but i aired it out in my room, and gave it 8 hours\u2026. It doesn\u2019t smell like chemicals and It felt perfect to jump right into a nights sleep. It was well worth $400",

                "reviewText": "The softness or firmness of any mattress is clearly subjective. To me this mattress is much more firm than not. While it is mostly comfortable to sleep on and seems high quality, there is no sinking at all into a form fitting memory foam layer that I had hoped for with a medium firm mattress. I do awaken each morning with mild back pain which has caused me to purchase a plush topper for the mattress making it incredibly high off the ground.The mattress itself plumped up perfectly and seems to be of good quality. If it had a 100 night trial like most I would give more stars. But as consumers we are left to follow the subjective reviews of others and this time I didn't win.",
