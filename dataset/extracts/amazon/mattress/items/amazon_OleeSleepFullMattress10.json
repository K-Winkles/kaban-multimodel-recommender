                "reviewText": "EDIT: 20 month post purchase update (original review below)-So far so good. I felt like this mattress has a little more \u201cgive\u201d where I sleep. I\u2019m not the kind of person who sleeps all over the bed. I sleep in one spot. So, when I moved to my new home, I turned it around and it has solved the problem. The area where I slept before shows no signs of the \u201cgive.\u201d I sleep alone, so I don\u2019t know how it affects couples. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d, 165lbs (160cm, 75Kg).I do recommend a mattress protector only because of the porous fabric. I learned this on the night of the pukies from my three-year-old daughter.In other news, I recommended this mattress to a friend and she bought it. She sleeps more soundly than she did on her innerspring mattress. I have added the photos from when we unzipped and let the mattress decompress. SHE LOVES IT. She says she read the conflicting reviews, but decided it was worth it because I wouldn\u2019t shut up about it. If she only gets a few years out of it, she still thinks it\u2019s a worthwhile investment because her sleep is so much better and her aches and pains are about gone. Her FitBit has shown a much better sleep pattern.Almost two years later and I\u2019m still in love with this mattress and the frame I bought to go with it.I waited to write this review after having this mattress for about six months. I like to have a product a while before writing a review. When this bed arrives, it comes in a box that is about 18\"x 18\"x 48\". That's an estimated size by memory. You pull the bed out and lay it out. It comes compressed and folded in half. Then, check for the zipper on the bed. Make sure that is on the bottom and open the plastic. The bed begins to decompress. Let it decompress for 24-48 hours. I let it decompress for 48 hours because I was moving into a new apartment and I had the time to do it. I put it on the Home Life Cloth Light Beige Cream Linen 51\" Tall Headboard Platform Bed with Slats Queen - Complete Bed 5 Year Warranty Included 008 Home Life Cloth Light Beige Cream Linen 51\" Tall Headboard Platform Bed with Slats Queen Bed and it looks amazing.Pros: Comfort! It does NOT sleep hot. I don't feel myself tossing and turning at night. I lay there, and I sink in, but not too much. It doesn't take too much effort to move like some lower density mattresses. Sheets do not slip off and they hold really well, so that's a big plus. The soft fabric covering the mattress holds sheets well and the stitched in pattern does not bleed through on white sheets. When I sit on the edge to play my guitar, it's the perfect height and my back feels great- better than any chair.Cons: I see a lot of reviews about the smell. I have a hyper sense of smell. The chemical smell dissipated in a few hours. I did not detect it at all after about six hours. Get the plastic the mattress came in out of your house if you don't want the smell lingering. The mattress is heavy, but that just indicates the quality of the product. Besides, all mattresses are heavy unless they are full of air. When it's cold, the bed becomes harder. When its hot, the bed is softer. Keep that in mind when adjusting the temp of the room. And when I say cold, I'm talking 35 degrees F. I left the heat off when I went out of town and the bed was denser than usual when I got back. I warmed up the room and it went quickly back to normal. On hot nights it is softer. I doubt you're sleeping in freezing temps, so this isn't a big deal.All in all, this thing is a great buy. I'm glad that Amazon has made it as a recommended product. It's comfortable and priced well. The queen sized one works well with a slat bed and after six months has continued to provide a restful night sleep. I'll try to remember to give it another review at the one year mark.",

                "reviewText": "This mattress is perfect. I ordered a Queen size.All my life I've slept on spring/coil mattresses and have grown to really hate them as I age because the springs cause more pain than they do anything else.When I saw this mattress and it's affordable price (budget friendly) I wanted to give it a try and get away from the 21-year-old spring mattress that I have been sleeping on.This mattress is packaged in a large, heavy box and wrapped in plastic. It unrolls after you pull the plastic off and then unfolds. Once I had all the plastic off of the mattress it started to fluff up and was the full 10\" within 3 hours. I was able to sleep on it the same night it arrived. There is a slight \"new\" smell that has been on every memory foam mattress topper I've bought, so this, of course, will go away in a few days and isn't too strong or overwhelming.Actually, this mattress is pretty light compared to the old spring mattress I have and found it to not be a problem putting it on the frame by myself.I do want to note this mattress is firm but not painful firm like a spring mattress that causes so much pain from coils that poke into your joints and body as you sleep. This mattress is firm at first but once you settle in the foam contours to your body and makes it very comfortable to sleep.Generally, I have trouble sleeping on anything firm, like my old mattress, even at 21 years of use, it is so firm that it feels the same as day 1 (painful and like sleeping on a slab of concrete).I have 2 back injuries and laying down on my back or stomach is very painful. Mostly I am a side sleeper but even then on a spring mattress, I wake up several times a night from either my shoulders and hips hurting so badly that I can barely roll over to the other side without feeling like my bones are shattering, but my arm falls asleep. It is hard for me to get comfortable on my old mattress and I wake up in more pain than I went to sleep in.WIth this mattress, I can lay down and quickly settle, even on my back without waking up in severe pain or with my arm falling asleep. In fact, I can sleep a whole night comfortably and wake up without pain. I'm amazed by that and know now that it is the mattress that caused so much pain all these years to my already painful bones.On all the mattress toppers I've had before, and there have been many, they all slept hot. I'd wake up even in winter sweating and with this mattress, I don't wake up sweating. It actually feels cool and comfortable.I really can't say enough good things about this mattress. It is light to move around and even on a platform bed frame, I can't feel the metal underneath. It feels like I am sleeping on a cloud. My bones don't ache anymore from sleeping and I am not waking up multiple times a night in pain. And I don't really like firm mattresses anymore, not after my old nightmare mattress that felt like sleeping on concrete. But this one is much different from being on a spring mattress and is also firm but very comfortable.Pros:Light to move aroundThick enough not to feel the metal bed frame on a platform frameFirm but not something you sink into or are uncomfortable on. Contours to the body and feels like sleeping on a marshmallow.Same thickness as a traditional spring mattress, 10\" of softness and no springsGood qualitySleeps cool, not hotHas a zippered cover that is plush and soft2 people can sleep on this mattress and not feel each other move or get upDid I mention it feels like sleeping on a marshmallow?Cons:0If you haven't tried this mattress yet and are in the market for a budget-friendly (could even sleep with it on the floor if you don't have a frame and be comfortable), firm yet very cozy, good quality mattress, this is the one. I am happy to have found this mattress and would recommend it to everyone looking for an upgrade from spring mattresses. I'll never go back to another spring mattress again. Not even my son (almost 3 years old) sleeps on a spring mattress. My son sleeps on a much smaller version of this mattress, of a different brand (Graco crib mattress) but still feels the same firmness (comfortable as well) and he sleeps the night through.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 3 of these for my teenage kids as Christmas gifts as they were all wanting memory foam mattresses. This was supposed to be a 10\u201d twin. Instructions said to allow 48-72 hours for foam to fully inflate.We lay them flat and they slowly increased in size. We unzipped the cover and exercised the foam daily in an attempt to get them to fully inflate. It has now been 6 days and none of them has inflated to more that 7 1/2 \u201c at the maximum. They have not recovered evenly and the head and foot of the beds have only expanded to about 6\u201d. The mattresses are not level to the head and foot dip downwards making for a uncomfortable sleep.We opened the cover and the foam at the head and foot of the bed appears melted. Almost like a hot knife cutter was used and it has compromised the foam. There is no way this foam will recover to 10\u201d - especially at the head and foot.The kids have not been able to use. I do not see them expanding to anywhere near the advertised 10\u201d. The. box said 10\u201d but wondering if the wrong mattress was packed or if these 7 1/2\u201d mattresses are just falsely advertised as 10\u201d. I have 3 of these and they are all defective and not as advertised. These are most disappointing.Update: I contacted Amazon to see about a return. A return label was generated and refund will be issued once shipped.However they will not go back in the box as they have obviously expanded. I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I can find another box to ship. So now I need to source 3 cardboard boxes large enough to ship an inflated twin mattress.",
