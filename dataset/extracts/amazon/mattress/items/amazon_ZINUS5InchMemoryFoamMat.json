It\u2019s about three inches. I rolled up a blanket to fill in that space, but I am afraid he might get his leg or arm caught if I\u2019m not super vigilant about keeping that blanket in place.",

                "reviewText": "This \"mattress\" arrived quick and tightly packed in a bag in a box. They seal the bag with extra room so it can be resealed and vacuumed shrunk for returns, which I'll be doing.Once I got mine out of the bag, I noticed the zipper was \"popped\". The zipper is NOT meant to be removed or opened, it is a \"one-way\" zipper for closing only, it doesn't go backwards. I was able to remove the zipper to close where it popped but the zip just started opening behind it again.From there I was starting to itch because the fiberglass fire retardant material was leeching through the cloth cover. The cover itself is vinyl? backed and is very noisy. I guess it's meant to keep the fiberglass from poking through but the sides are open cloth so you can see where shards are poking out of the sides. The top view where it looks shiny is because of the fiberglass cover.I had originally bought this to cut it open for a motor home mattress but because of the poor quality and the fact that it's literally falling apart as the air is getting to it, I've already had enough of it.Since it was already open, there's only 4\" of foam inside and an inch of that is the airpocket from the eggcrate foam. I tried to lay on it. For camping it would probably not be all that bad. It didn't smell that bad, it was more noticeable in the Airstream in an enclosed space.I know most of these \"bed in a box\" mattresses are going to have fiberglass as a fire retardant inside, but seriously, there has to be a safer way of keeping it contained. Or at least a cover where it doesn't just leech out. Did you ever sleep on a real feather down pillow with a cheap pillow case on it? That is this mattress.",
