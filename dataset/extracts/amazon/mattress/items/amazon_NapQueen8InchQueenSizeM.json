Very comfortable, great quality, and 8 inches left enough spacing for the rails so he doesn't roll off the bed. You can't get a mattress better than this for the price. It did have weird corners like other reviewers mentioned but it doesn't impact the bed at all, the sheets still fit and hold.",

The memory foam seems to be good quality. We let it sit out and expand for three days",

It's also is impossible to find nice standard (not deep pocket) sheets at a reasonable price. Spend the extra cash and get more than an 8 inch mattress.
