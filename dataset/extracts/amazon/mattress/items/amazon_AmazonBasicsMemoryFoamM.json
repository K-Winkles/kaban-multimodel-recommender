I was really pleasantly surprised and the quality of this mattress as well as the comfort, which rivals the above! It is also Certi-pur and I believe Oeko-Tex certified, which was very reassuring! The smell when you open the package is expected for memory foam, but this was very mild and aired out within the first day.",

So what I did was put it between my mattress in my box springs to give me movement and Kush underneath my mattress. I\u2019m pretty satisfied with that.

It pretty much means nothing to you. The edges are good and strong, you can sit on the edge and put your socks on without it getting crunched down real badly. We have this on a metal Frame also purchased here on Amazon and it is working out quite well. Have not slept on it during the summer yet, so I cannot attest to if it\u2019s cool to sleep on or not. But so far we are liking it and it was a good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I was disappointed with this mattress but didn't want the hassle of trying to return it. If I did I would be stuck in the same position of having to order another one which probably wouldn't be any better (possibly worse) and then dealing with that. I can't afford to go to a mattress store, and I still might not know without trying it out in comfortable clothes and all my pillows etc. I'm very picky, I have a difficult time being comfortable in general, so take this with a grain of salt, but personally this was so much worse than my last one (had it 10 years and was happy with it for 9), which I also ordered on Amazon for roughly the same price, but they don't carry it anymore. I tried a memory foam mattress topper which I hoped would improve the old mattress, but it causes me to sink too much in the middle and hurt my back (and still isn't soft enough not to put pressure on my hips). It did the same thing on the new mattress as well, so that was a bust. I got a pillow topper and that is helping a bit. But I still dream of the new bed I had last time. Super soft, cradles everything evenly, and still supports your body so your spine is straight (side sleeper). Anyway this is at least supportive enough. It's probably fine for most people. Nothing special.",
