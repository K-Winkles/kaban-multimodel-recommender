                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Firm and soft at the same time",
                "reviewText": "I bought this because my husband and I have been sleeping on a hand-me-down mattress for nearly 10 years and it was really bad on his back. He has some disc compression and his doctor recommended a medium firm to firm innerspring mattress with a memory foam top or mattress topper if we needed it to keep from getting sore on pressure points while we slept. This mattress just fit the bill (in more ways than one because of the great price). My husband is nearly 6'5\" and weighs around 270. I have noticed him moving around so much less when he sleeps than he did on our old bed. When he does move around or just gets in or out of bed, I don't get bounced around like in our old bed because the springs are individual. The springs also keep him from creating a deep depression in the mattress that makes me have to fight all night against sliding into the hole. The memory foam layer is soft enough and thick enough to relieve pressure but thin enough to not negate the support of the more firm innerspring foundation. We had been using a 4 inch thick firm memory foam mattress topper on our old innerspring for the last 3 or 4 years. It was much better than without it, but created problems this one doesn't. The thicker foam compresses more and more as the night goes on and can leave us feeling like we're sleeping in a hole. It's actually alot harder to move around on that thick foam and I found myself waking up to change positions because it took a little too much effort to sleep through. And since there was no edge support, I'd just slide off if I sat on the mattress close to the edge, or I'd just feel like I was fighting sliding off when laying down close to the edge because of the slant created by my own weight. (I'm smaller than the average female btw, but that was still a problem). None of those problems occur with the mattress. It seems to be the ideal thickness and firmness for us, and the edges are nicely supported while still being soft enough to not be uncomfortable while sitting on the edge of the bed. We've been sleeping on it for almost a week, and he's still so much more comfortable while sleeping and when he wakes up in the morning. In the past, when we've stayed in hotels or been guests in someone else's home, even if the bed seemed more comfortable at first, new problems would start to reveal themselves by about night 3, and he'd start feeling discomfort somewhere else in his back or neck. Even if a mattress was better on the area that our home mattress irritated, it would end up causing discomfort in some other way. So far, this new mattress has remained comfortable for him longer than any other. I'll update if that changes. The mattress can be rotates head to foot, but not flipped be a the top is different than the bottom. We will rotate it regularly because of our size difference to try to keep the wear as even as possible. If it doesn't wear well or we become less happy with it, I'll update my review. So far I would recommend this mattress to anyone needing or wanting this type of support, especially if they have a smaller budget.",

The difference is huge.For its price it\u2019s a great mattress, it\u2019s firm as advertised and I am super comfortable on it. From the softness you can feel the springiness. There is practically no foam on the mattress. It has minimal cushioning, and you can bounce on it easily. The springs are big and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll last more than 3-4 years. Good thing it\u2019s a guest mattress I\u2019ll have to see what it feels like in a couple of years.Totally worth the selling price minus the false advertising of Hybrid.",

                "reviewText": "Love it, it's firm but still a little soft. Like the title says, it likes to go from coiled to flat in like five seconds, so make sure your not going to get knocked over once you cut the plastic with the handy tool they provide. Even after expanding for a few hours it's super comfy, even better the next day. Probably one of the better mattresses I've ever slept on, like, GOD... I woke up this morning feeling like a hundred bucks. Vinny the Cat likes it too because now he has his own side.",
