                "reviewText": "I got a full size mattress for my spare bedroom. The mattress came in super quick it was suppose to come the 25th. I ordered the mattress on the 16th. So super fast delivery. The mattress puffed up with in 30 mins to the 12\u201d profile. It\u2019s super comfortable, not too firm and not too soft. This will definitely be perfect for guest when they come visit. Even my dog like the bed. He won\u2019t stay off it. The only thing that I wasn\u2019t a fan of was the mattress did have a slight smell. But by opening a window the smell is mostly gone.",

                "reviewText": "This is the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on! First, it came 5 days early(yay!), 2nd, no awful odor, 3rd, it expanded much quicker than expected, 4th, it is so comfortable, and last but not least, extremely affordable, especially since I'm disabled, on a limited fixed income. Simple things like replacing is so expensive these days, and I have been searching for months for the right one at the right price. I have a second bed that needs the mattress replaced, I will be buying another in the next month.",

It came in faster than expected, it\u2019s huge truly a king size and it both soft to lay on yet a little firm. Great buy!! I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed, was definitely worth my money!",

I\u2019ve recently just moved into my new apartment & finally opened the box & slept on it. I\u2019m currently 5 months pregnant with twins so it is very comfy on my back & my belly. So much relief. It\u2019s not too firm nor too soft & it\u2019s true to size. No smell when opened. Right now it\u2019s on the floor until I can afford to get a platform bed frame & yet still very comfy.",
