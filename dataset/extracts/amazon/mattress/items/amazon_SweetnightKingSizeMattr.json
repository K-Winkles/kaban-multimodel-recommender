I was initially worried about how it would he shipped because a king bed is so big, but it came in a really cool small box. It was wrapped up airtight, and when I unrolled it, it expanded into a king size. I really liked how easy it was to get set up on the bed frame. Things I really like about it are: 1. It\u2019s very comfortable! It feels like a memory foam mattress. When you touch it, it moves around my fingers. My father fell asleep on it the second day, even before we had the sheets on it. Lol. 2. It was very easy to set up. It took me under 10 minutes total. I took it out of the box, took it out of the plastic and it expanded over the next day or so. I took pictures to show because it was pretty neat. 3. The price was great for the value. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with it.",

First one was a full size for my guest room; turned out super comfortable that kids and I like to sleep on it; form enough to support my back, and soft enough to relax my muscles. This king size one doesn\u2019t disappoint me either. It is so comfortable that my wife likes it so much. We use the most firm side, holds two adults and three kids with no problems. Sleeping on it for a week, pressure relief, feels very good, no more back sores or pain. The color of the mattress is gray to black with water flow strips, beautiful design. The mattress is not easy to get dirty, some water or stain can be easily cleaned or wiped off. I highly recommend it. The package is compact and air sealed very well.",

As expected, the newbie packaged well, easily setup, and no bad smell at all. First few nights, the mattress feels maybe a little too soft to me since I'm just not used to sinking into my bed. So I flipped it over and used the bottom side. Now it proved to be just the right amount of support for me, and I've been sleeping very well every night since. No back or hip pain, and don't feel like laying on a giant marshmallow. I like this reversible design and I would give it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Great mattress at a great price. After researching many mattresses, I came across this one, and I have to tell you I love this mattress. It expanded nicely after opening shrink wrap. Feels like a soft-medium, not true medium, as far as firmness. Firm yet also very soft. After more than a week, I am still sleeping well. It has just the right amount of foam that gives enough cushion to prevent my back pain . It took me about 2 days for the corners to fully pop all the way up so don\u2019t get discouraged if it\u2019s not complete after the 24 hours. Only thing I dislike is the edges are a little flimsy so you can't sleep directly on the edge or you will roll off but who sleeps right on the edge when you have such a big bed anyways? so worth the money!",

It is comfortable and firm and I love that it\u2019s so thick! It\u2019s been about three weeks now and I have not had any back pain from it and have slept like a baby!It\u2019s definitely worthy the price and I am considering getting another for my kids once they grow out of their single beds.

This mattress is firm enough not too soft not too hard. It doesn\u2019t cave in when we sleep on it. The mattress is neatly packed in a air tight bag. Have to mention that there is no smell when the package was opened. It expanded well after leaving it for 24 hours. The best part, the mattress comes with a cover which makes it very easy to maintain especially with kids who jumped on it even before I put the sheets.Overall it\u2019s a good buy.",
