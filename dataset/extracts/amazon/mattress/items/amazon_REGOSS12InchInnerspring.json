When you open the plastic surrounding the mattress, make sure you have it on the bed frame because it opens very quickly and expands right away! Has no smell which I was very concerned about. And if your partner moves on the bed at the same time as you, you don\u2019t feel it it\u2019s really nice, it\u2019s comfortable it\u2019s supportive and I like the softer side that\u2019s just me but I still feel I have enough support so glad I have it so glad I bought it. PS it\u2019s extremely heavy when you get it I ordered a full size. The ad says it weighs 10 pounds. It\u2019s more like 100 pounds and it took two men to bring the box into my foyer , so make sure you have someone there to help you it\u2019s really heavy",

                "reviewText": "Purchased for my first apartment, wanted soft (not firm) mattress. This is perfect for side sleepers like me. I was skeptical for hybrid mattress, cause I wanted memory foam only. But this is perfect! I have lower back problems, and this mattress easily helps shaping to your form.Some review said that it didn\u2019t puff up all the way (top foam), but after sitting for 24 hours without laying on it, mattress was able to adjust to 12in. 10/10!",

This one is for upstairs bedroom.I especially like these features1) Using both sides depending on how you want the mattress to feel ( soft/ medium firm or flip to other - firm side )2) Handles on both sides to turn mattress around or flip to other side3) Because of these flip features I get longer use out of the mattress and my back feels better4) Inexpensive cost compared to well known brand name mattresses and coupon is usually offered on Amazon Happy I did the research and discovered this company!",
