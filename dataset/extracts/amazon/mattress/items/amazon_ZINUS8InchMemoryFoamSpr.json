                "reviewText": "Mattress was shipped and arrived on time and in good condition. Box is heavy, but survived shipment. I took it upstairs before opening and that was definitely the smart thing to do. The mattress is heavy since it has springs. The card that comes with it pre-warned me that the mattress knows Kung Foo and to watch out when opening since it is under a lot of pressure. I was careful when opening and it was such a fun thing to watch! Placed the mattress on the bed and it near doubled in size over the course of just one day. Assuming about 48 hours to be fully \"unpacked,\" but my daughter (12) slept on it the first night and was very pleased. It is just the right amount of soft comfort, but without sinking in. Even if it only lasts a couple years, this is well worth the purchase for now. Will update if anything changes!",
