                "reviewText": "We got the 10inch, in the hopes it would be on the firmer side. It is! We had quite the journey finding the right mattress. We have an older zinus memory foam that I love, but it is a Queen and we now sleep on a king. A couple years ago I ordered what I thought was the same mattress (but in king) and it just wasn\u2019t the same. Too soft, not enough support and I get migraines from it. So then we went mattress shopping and I only like the $6k Tempurpedic firm mattress, of course. Knowing it was possible to find something cheaper, I went ahead and got a \u201cplank\u201d mattress, which was wayyy too firm. But the company was great and refunded. So I decided to take a chance and order this Zinus mattress, knowing how much I loved the original, but having a hard time finding something comparable, since it is no longer sold. Happy to report this mattress is the one! It\u2019s not exact, but close enough that I don\u2019t get migraines. It\u2019s very supportive and doesn\u2019t give in the tummy/hip area during the night. Keeps you straight. I\u2019m 165 pounds. No idea of durability, but I don\u2019t really care. Just relieved to have something that works for now and doesn\u2019t cost $6k.",

I have scoliosis so my mattress comfort is important. So far this mattress has definitely checked that box! I\u2019ve slept on it for a couple days so far and haven\u2019t woken up with back or hip pain as I am a side sleeper! First the mattress does have a nice amount of give not too much or less. I\u2019m also a tossed turner and I have no issues flopping around into different positions. I did not experience a smell from the mattress. Set up was extremely easy! I opened it on my bed frame so I did not have to move it once it set up. The box wasn\u2019t too heavy but I also live on a single floor home so moving it up stairs may be a bit difficult. So far I love this mattress and would recommend to others!",

                "reviewText": "Easily the best and most comfortable bed I\u2019ve ever had. I paid 3x as much as I did for this mattress and the Zinus brand is better. No joke. I sleep like a rock since receiving this. Came in a box, so awesome and easy to carry for me (about 80lbs). Built in USA so you\u2019re supporting your fellow country people vs some other country that has crappy QC. The customer service people are great too. I called them to register my bed with the warranty they offer included in price and the lady helped me out, was pleasant, didn\u2019t wait on hold for even 5 mins. Zinus has their stuff together and I\u2019m a believer! I bought on a cyber Monday deal but even the regular price far exceeds paying triple for an inferior product with a good brand name. You spend 1/3 of your life in bed. Might as well do I in style and have enough money left over to buy a foundation from Zinus and a couple hundred bucks to spend on a new comforter, sheets, new pillows and dinner at a high end restaurant.This is a no brainer type of deal and my life has changed since I rolled the dice on this brand I have never heard of before. I\u2019m happy to report that instead of tossing/turning on my old pillow top bed I literally fall asleep fast and wake up in the same exact position.The frame is made solid so no squeaky sounds upon laying down, solid feel too. Do what I did and grab a matress and the frame and I even have 14 inches under the bed to store and stow away items that would never fit under a standard bed with box spring.I can\u2019t say enough for the overall experience with Zinus and my excitement rubbed off on my Mom who purchased a full size at regular price for her guest room bed. She then told my aunt who also bought a queen like me. The feeling of not being tired after sleeping 6 hrs/night is priceless! My back pain has subsided, my deep sleep mode is stellar, and my life has been exceptionally better all because of this mattress and frame. Im in sales and honestly could go door to door with this product and be very successful selling these. They sell themselves! If you\u2019re in the market for an A* experience and are skeptical, roll the dice because you will win everytime with this gem of a set up. That is all.",

But, I let it air out and fully expand for 48 hours before we slept on it and there was zero odor!This mattress is the perfect amount of plush and firm. I love soft mattresses BUT my back does not. This offers the best of both worlds and I have had zero back or hip pain upon waking. I\u2019m super active and rest is crucial for my lifestyle. I can honestly say I look forward to crawling into bed every night and have slept through the night with almost zero disruptions since we got this mattress.",

We recently bought a full-size mattress, and when it was delivered, we immediately believed the size wasn't proper. We asked for a return and a replacement, and the seller immediately shipped a replacement and issued a return notice. When the second delivery arrived, I saw that the size seemed to match the first. After getting in touch with the seller, they provided a thorough explanation of how the goods would swell to its typical size when opened. I did what they said, and everything worked out just as they had said. Throughout the communication process, they responded promptly and patiently explained the situation. Their products and service are excellent.",
