                "reviewText": "First experience with a roll-up mattress, I was skeptical about whether they would really be a firm mattress. Totally satisfied. Gave it the recommended 3 days to fully unspring and it was a great, firm comfortable mattress to sleep on. Given how much easier it was to shop and get in the bedroom than a store-bought mattress, this is the way I'm going for future purposes, too. Just one caveat: when you're sitting on the side of the bed to step in and step out, it does sag a lot more than a non-compression inner spring. Not sure why that doesn't happen when you're prone, but it doesn't. Nice that it was Made in USA, too, and competitively priced with the imported alternatives. No smell/ outgassing, either.",

                "reviewText": "Since this was purchased for the guest room, I can only base my comments on how the first guests felt about the bed.I agree with some reviews; that the sides slope and have little support. Sitting on the sides of the bed to dress or put on shoes is when you would notice this the most. Guests thought that the bed over-all, had nice support, and was great to sleep on.As far as reviews that complain the mattress doesn't have a long wear-life; I assume that ours will be fine for some time, due to being a guest use only bed.It inflated very quickly; but didn't reach 12\", even after a long resting period. It appears well made, and had no smell.",

                "reviewText": "Well, after burning through several hybrid mattresses, that would only last 2 months at best before sagging and causing pain and restless nights trying to find a comfortable high spot to fall asleep on. I came across this one. I'm 6 foot and my weight hovers around 240. This mattress IS firm. But that's what I wanted, good thick springs. To help soften it up, I went with a 2-inch latex mattress topper. It's been 7 months now; I do have to turn the topper because it will sag, or some may say conform. The first time that happened, I thought the mattress was starting to sag, but no, the mattress is like the day I got it. No more pain or broken sleep. I definitely recommend it.",

However, it didn't last.We've been sleeping on this mattress for almost exactly five (5) weeks and it's sagging terribly. The sides don't stay firm and it's almost like sleeping on a soft mattress we sink in so far. It's not comfortable and we're not sleeping -- again. Unfortunately, the \"return\" policy is only if you don't even open the mattress in the first place - it has to be returned in it's original, unopened state. So, now we have a mattress that roughly cost us $100/wk to sleep on. NO thank you!",
