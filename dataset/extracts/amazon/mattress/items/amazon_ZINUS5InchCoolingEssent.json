                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 of these mattresses in twin for an extendable day bed. The mattresses are very comfortable. We have had several guests stay on them, all of them sleeping on them in the stacked twin configuration. Not one complaint. Everyone has said they are comfortable. They are lightweight and easy to set up. Just remove it from the box, unroll it, and cut the plastic off carefully. Expands fully within 24 hours, but didn't use them or make the bed for 72 hours, just in case.One issue though. These mattresses came in 2 different deliveries. I noticed the first mattress delivered took a lot longer to expand after being removed from the box than the second mattress. The corners never fully expanded. You can tell from the second picture. The instructions said to open within 72 hours of delivery, and I opened both within ten minutes of them being left at my front door. I suspect one sat in the Amazon warehouse longer than the other mattress. Not worth it to return an expanded mattress to Amazon, but a bit disappointed in the inconsistency. If these mattresses have an \"expiration\" date, the seller needs to work out it with Amazon so that inventory doesn't age out in the warehouse, and those that are kept beyond \"expiration\" are sold at a discount.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 12\u201d mattress for my son. It was well packaged. Heavier than I expected carrying it up the stairs to the bedroom. I was a little skeptical about this purchase based on reviews that said it smelled (and it was pretty inexpensive on Black Friday), but there was ZERO smell when I unpackaged it and 5 days later still no smell. It came out of the packaging easily and has a nice cover over it that can be removed to wash. I let it inflate for 48 hours before I even touched it. The end of the bed that was rolled up to the inside in the packaging looked like it didn\u2019t inflate all the way so I turned it around (thinking maybe the wall that end was sitting against was too cold ) and it still didn\u2019t inflate all the way - let it sit 2 more days and made sure the cover wasn\u2019t too tight and that did the trick. The bed is on the firm side, but not too firm. If you\u2019re looking for a memory foam you sink into this is not for you. I haven\u2019t done more than lay in it and found it comfortable, felt good laying flat on my back after 14 hours at work. My little one just slept for 10 straight hours and said it was \u201clike a cloud\u201d so I\u2019m taking that as a win.",

Then opening the plastic, it immediately began to puff out to size. We opened it around 6am and by 6pm it appeared to be to full size. It seemed firm yet cushy and sleeping on it for the first time felt great, until waking in the morning. My husband loved it, but my back cannot handle how firm it is. I wanted to give it some time for my body to adjust but still after a few weeks it is still so firm that I decided to order a soft mattress topper for it. I am having better sleep on the couch than I am in this bed but hoping that the topper will comfort my back\u2026 overall the mattress is made well and appears to be good quality. Since my husband likes it I am giving 3 stars but my the sake of my back, its a no go for me\u2026",

Came tightly packed in a tall box and it didn't take long to inflate all the way. I had no issues with it, and with a matress protector it will be good for a long time to come. I purchased one for myself and for my mother as well that's how good the quality is, and the price is so reasonable. 1000% recommend. Your back will thank you",

                "reviewText": "I bought the 8\" version in twin for my daughter's bunk bed not thinking about the mattress height and how it effectively makes the safety railing shorter.I have the 8\" on the bottom and the 5\" now replaced the top mattress. I'm 175 lbs and 5'11\" and I find both to be very comfortable. I also have the 12\" queen version for myself and it's fantastic too. If these are just for kids I definitely think the 5\" one is good enough. Only people who are heavier would need the thicker 8\" or 12\" versions in my opinion. Definitely measure your bunk bed top rail and make sure you are in safety requirements before ordering any mattress for the top.",
