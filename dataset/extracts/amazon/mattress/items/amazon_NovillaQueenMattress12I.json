On the manual says that it needs three days to fully expand. It actually expanded remarkably fast in just 24 hours, showcasing its high-quality build (maybe also because the stocking time is short, so it takes less time than normal to recover). The materials used are good, no chemical smell at all. The pillow top is incredibly soft, providing a luxurious and comfortable surface to sleep on. The mattress is actually medium firm, boasts a 3-zoned ergonomic design catering to all sleeping positions. The cooling gel memory foam and bamboo charcoal foam layers deliver a refreshing and supportive sleep experience. The manufacture says that it may take 100 days before getting used to a new mattress, but our family fall in love with new mattress in just several nights sleeping on it. With a 10-year limited warranty, Novilla stands behind their product, assuring long-term satisfaction. Highly recommend!",

I tried different sleep positions on it and the hybrid foams on top are supportive. I can relax with my back and shoulder with no issue. It delivered faster than the estimated time on Amazon. It was easy to unfold the mattress, it took a while for it to become fully bouncy and soft. The smell is friendly and it went away before I actually went to sleep the first night. For this price point, it\u2019s definitely a good buy.",

This mattress blew my mind on the first night, I have had it three nights now and last night I slept 7 hours on one side w/o tossing and turning.Incredible at any price point, but for <$300? Mind blown. No smell thanks to charcoal memory foam, incredibly soft pocket coils, no pressure points. Get this and a $300 adjustable frame and save yourself thousands over a similar configuration from a conventional bed store",
