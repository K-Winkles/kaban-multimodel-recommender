My husband's always thought it's great, but as a mom who had a baby a year ago and is still getting back into the swing of things, it was a bit too firm for me. This foam mattress is solid in craftsmanship and support! The stitching is on point. I'm happy it arrived before Christmas, and when I popped the seal, there was hardly any smell \u2013 it pretty much puffed up right away. Still, I gave it a couple of days in the study before jumping in. This medium-firm is a real medium-firm compared to our old one. Sitting on the edge isn't as rock-hard as those spring ones, and sleeping on it doesn't feel like I'm sinking too deep. It gives decent support to my waist and back.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this TeQsli mattress as Christmas gift for the new home, and used it for one month and a half. This is 10-inch Queen- size memory foam with pillow top. I like its breathable knit fabric, so I didn't sweat at nights. The pocket zones with hybrid innerspring coils give medium firmness, and allow release of long-sitting stress and my back pain. Also importantly, the mattess is certified by CertiPUR-US and manufactured with health safety material. Overall, I like this purchase and enjoy sleeping on this mattress. In future I may buy a thicker 12-in and firmer one of this brand.",

Not super supportive on the edges but what do you expect with a mattress in the mail? No stinky chemical smell, arrived super fast, lightweight enough to move around easily. I love it!",
