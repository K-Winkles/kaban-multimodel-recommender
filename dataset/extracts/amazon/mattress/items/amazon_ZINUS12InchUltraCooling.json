I'm getting older now and have a little arthritis and the one I was sleeping on was making me wake up sore in the morning and so when I was fed up with feeling sore in the morning, I decided to try to buy a mattress online and luckily I picked a great one. They say it inflates better if it's warm so I put a space heater in the room and within 6 hours it went from 4 in high to the full 12-inch high mattress that I ordered. It is just fantastic!",

                "reviewText": "The only reason I\u2019m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that these mattresses are next to impossible to return. This is my first memory foam and it\u2019s not the perfect mattress for me. But it\u2019s not like I can return it. That being said, it\u2019s good enough. But I wish for the price it was perfect. I got the 12 inch. It\u2019s a pretty firm mattress. I\u2019d like a little softer mattress. You don\u2019t sink into this at all so if you like firm, this is for you. I do not wake up with any bank pain though. Probably a hybrid would have been a better choice for me. But I still like it.As for the cooling effect\u2026it does not necessarily feel cool to me. But it\u2019s definitely not hot or warm so I\u2019d say it does the job. The feel of the fabric is nice. And it expanded immediately and fast.For those liking a firm mattress I would say this is top choice. I just didn\u2019t know what I liked but that is not the manufacturers fault and it\u2019s still a lovely bed. Just wish there was an easy exchange policy. But that\u2019s the price you pay for a bed in a box verses an expensive store. I definitely would still recommend this bed.Also to the manufacturer, there was a dead baby ring neck snake in the plastic. Interesting. Kind of gross. Wasn\u2019t touching the mattress thankfully. It was an interesting surprise. But you might want to check your warehouse lol.",

At home we have the hybrid tempurpedic, however, we were not willing to spend that kind of money for something we will use a few times per month. With that said, my husband had a serious neck injury years back and I have a bad back. So we prefer firm mattresses and we relied heavily on the reviews. I will say I am glad so far that I went with this mattress. The three factors that came into play in order to make a decision was the reviews, the price, and that it is made in the USA.We have slept on this mattress only twice but my goodness is it comfortable. It is firm yet soft. hard to explain. It is very supportive and there is no motion transfer with this mattress, which is a huge bonus. I hope this matrress holds up. I will come back in about 6-8 months to provide an update.",

I had an old memory foam mattress that I had bought at BJ\u2019s wholesale 15 years ago. Don\u2019t judge me! I was worried about replacing it. This thing popped right open with no issues I let it sit for the full 72 hours actually a little more than that it went right into shape like it\u2019s supposed to. It was the full 10 inches which is the size that I bought and there\u2019s no issues Whatsoever. Being that it\u2019s only the 10 inch one obviously it\u2019s not the most comfortable ever but for the price it can\u2019t be beat.",

                "reviewText": "26hrs unboxed and that is the picture you see; however, I could tell this was going to be situation just as soon as the mattress unrolled from the compression wrapper. Love the feel of this mattress and very excited to finally get some rest because it\u2019s cool and comfy but also firm, but it looks like a swing and a miss\u2026. The first person at Amazon I talked told me that I could return it, I laughed at them and said how\u2026? They transferred me to the person I am hold with now, who is currently on another line looking for my options while I listen to bad elevator music, been trying to get help on what to do next or try and return the defective mattress for over an hour now and have talked to a real person for about 8mins of it\u2026. I was informed that in the fine print somewhere it says we must wait 72hrs to see if the mattress fully expands, and was informed to call back when it hasn\u2019t. Like they knew it was not going to expand, it was a little strange. I asked how I was to return it and they said because it is out of box and a big item that Amazon would take care of that- kind of interested to see how. I followed up that it is strange to return a mattress and if the one I purchased was a return- they stuttered and then said no it should be new. Here\u2019s to hoping! I will update this review in a few days after we see what happens.",
