In the past I tried blow up mattresses which were ok but not all that comfortable and would sometimes deflate while in use.This was a HUGE improvement! It unfolded easily, and was a great size - I bought the Twin XL which gave lots of room for me to move around and not feel like I was going to go off the edge. I love the fact that it comes with a case to help carry it around. It feels like it is good quality and will last, too. Most importantly, I slept normally - it was quite comfortable. I was able to catch a good sale so I completely feel that I made a good purchase! I would recommend.",

I am past the age when I can comfortably sleep on even a high quality camp pad, and if I can't comfortably sleep, the rest of the plan doesn't work.I ordered three 75\"x 25\" 4\" trifold mattresses and slept on each for 1 night. None of them were horrible, but this one seemed more comfortable.Then I put all three next to each other, and sat/laid down on each.I could feel the floor through all the others I, but *not* through this one.This one is solid enough that I can't feel the hard surface below it, and soft enough that I don't get back pain or hot spots (Both of which happen when I try to sleep on a regular camping pad or inflatable mattress).Interestingly, this one is also the *least* expensive!Also, this is the only one that came with a handy carrying case! I had resigned myself to sewing my own, but no need!",

                "reviewText": "Pretty darn good. Got it on sale during a Black Friday thing. It\u2019s comfy, the cover is soft. I like that the cover is removable, making for easy washing. For kids, a disposable waterproof pad(like the ones used for potty training dogs) could easily be slipped inside. Lots of pics in my review, here are thoughts:Came rolled up and compressed. Immediately began expanding upon opening, a good sign. I removed the foam to help the process go faster, so that the edges and corners weren\u2019t slowed by the cover. The cover was easy to put back on, but is not loose or baggy at all.The foam inside has two layers. A higher density white foam on the bottom and a softer blue foam on the top. All in all, quite comfortable to lay on.The length and width are spot on to the advertised measurements. Part of my 4-star rating came from the thickness. This is advertised as a 4\u201d thick pad, and it only is 3.5\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering if half an inch really would make much more of a difference, talk to any man you know ;-). Not enough to send it back, but really not accurate.The other reason for the 4-star is that it lacks any Velcro straps to hold it closed when folded. These would make it easier to store and carry. It didn\u2019t advertise this, but they\u2019re on all other tri-folds I\u2019ve used and would make handling easier.All in all a very good pad. 4 stars, but the two things I mentioned are minor to most people. I would recommend this pad.",

We even let my toddler lay on it folded up when relaxing in front of the TV for a little. We think this would also be great to travel with - more comfortable than an air mattress although not as compact, or to have as an option when you have a lot of younger guests sleeping over.",

                "reviewText": "Surprisingly comfortable for being only 4\u201d thick. It came with its own case, rather cheaply made. We bought it bundled with another case and fitted sheet. Even though it came with a case, the other case in the bundle was much better made. Their own fitted sheet is a good idea, because this mattress is only 25\u201d wide, much narrower than a twin bed 38\u201d. The narrow width does make it a bit tricky to turn over without rolling off.",

This is deep enough & firm enough, even for a side sleeper on hardwood floors! And it folds neatly into a nearby closet! My husband suggested it for camping or RV use too! I'm not sure if it's thick enough or be comfortable enough to support a large person, but if you're average size & don't need/want something more permanent this is an excellent choice. It's also suggested as a topper, but it could be used by itself on a platform bed too. Very happy with my purchase!",
