It's very comfortable and an excellent choice for the price. So far all 4 of us have used it several times and it was comfortable for everyone, no complaints and everyone got a good nights sleep. In my household we are ages 2-45. When I unpacked it I gave it a full 48 hours to decompress fully before anyone used it. The smell was ok when I unpacked it, I've experienced worse in the past with other mattresses, it went away after about a day and a half.",

Never waited this long for anything purchased on prime. Especially living in North California where's there's Amazon hubs near by. Other than that. Mattress itself, is everything as advertised. Quality is beyond what we expected. Got the 12\" king size med-firm. Feels firm but soft. Really comfortable! Right out of the box, no smell. Expanded to 12\" less than a couple of hours. Which was awesome! First night of sleep on the mattress, have to say probably best nights of sleep in a long time and slept through the night without tossing and turning. Didn't wake up with back pain at all. I've been dealing with pain for a long time and this mattress really helped with lower back pressure. My wife's has worse back pain then I do and her lower back pain was relieved as well. Pain not totally gone but after a few nights her pain is getting better and better. Definitely don't hesitate to purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the FWD King Mattress with 10-inch Gel Memory Foam from Amazon, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.The gel memory foam provides an incredible level of comfort, contouring to my body for a restful and rejuvenating night's sleep. I appreciate the balanced support it offers \u2013 not too firm, not too soft, just perfect. The 10-inch thickness adds a luxurious feel to the mattress, creating a plush sleeping surface.The mattress arrived promptly and conveniently compressed in a box. Unboxing and setting it up were a breeze, with the mattress expanding to its full size within a short time. The quality craftsmanship is evident, and the cover is not only soft but also easy to clean.What sets this mattress apart is its ability to regulate temperature with the gel-infused memory foam, keeping me cool and comfortable throughout the night.If you're in the market for a king-size mattress that combines superior comfort, support, and cooling technology, the FWD King Mattress with 10-inch Gel Memory Foam is a fantastic choice. It's a true investment in quality sleep, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their sleep experience. Ollie approves!",

                "reviewText": "When it first arrived it was about 2.5 inches high and was slanted to one side.After 6 hours the mattress started to take shape and is now up to 7 inches.I am not sure this will expand to 8 inches and I will update this after giving it two more days.One downside is that the corners do not expand totally as in the picture.Other than that it seems like a very good mattress. It\u2019s firm and I weigh 160lbs.I do not sink at all and is supportive.I got an 8 inch for a good price but if I were to purchase it again, I am curious about the 12 inch since its only $20 difference from the 8 inch and I believe it would provide very much support.The 8 inch is totally fine though too.Additionally there is a weird smell that is still lasting after 8 hours but as the other reviews say I am waiting for it to go away in a couple more days.Very satisfied with this purchase.Update.It has been 30 hours since I've opened the mattress.Most of the parts have expanded up to around 7 and 1/2 inches, which seems enough. However, the sides are only 6 inches. The sides doesn't seem to expand that well. Overall, the mattress is very good and satisfactory. The firmness is strong but due to the 2 inch foam topper inside, it is soft. I have a 3 inch topper and when I put this on top it is extremely comfortable to lay down.I am waiting one more day for it to fully expand and then I will start sleeping on it and update it again.Regarding the smell, there is a weird smell to it still. The instructions say that the smell will go away in 72 hours, so I am giving it two more days to see what happens. I will update again.",

Then carefully remove The plastic fill in the bag. It immediately starts reverting to its full size. I was very pleased to discover it had none of the unusual odors often associated with new memory foam. I'm ordering another one to replace another child's mattress today. It's so comfortable, and is an excellent value. When My wife and I replace ours in another year or two, this is the avenue we will be taking.",

I got the full size 14 inch and I didn\u2019t pull out a ruler to check, but it\u2019s huge. Pretty firm but still cushion-y. Super comfortable bed, I love it so far!
