The website states that a box spring mattress can be used as the mattress foundation. It\u2019s true. I used the box spring mattresses and bed frames from the mattresses that I replaced as the foundations for both new mattresses. They work fine. The mattresses had a faint VOC odor when first unpacked. The odor went away after two days. I did not place sheets on the mattresses until the odor went away.",

I was a bit worry about the lack of support. I also understand why some reviews said this mattress would not be recommended for grown ups. After a week or so, the mattress sort of settled in and it felt a lot firmer. My son slept longer and he loves it. The foam cradles him and he sleeps very well. The only thing is the two ends never expand to the same level as the middle, but it think it\u2019s ok for a little kid. For the price it is a good choice for kids bed.",

We wanted to get a king mattress but didn't want to invest a ton of $$$$ as we plan to move in 3-4 years. This was the perfect buy. We've only had it for a month but I've slept wonderfully every night. It's quite firm for a memory foam mattress which is what I like so much about it, but it also doesn't give me should pain from being too firm.",

I'm a side sleeper and would wake up with a sore hip on my old mattress - Sleeping on this Siena, I wake up with no pain. It's super comfortable - and while it may seem 'firm' when first laying down on it, it's actually quite soft and forms to your body. So happy with this purchase and would highly recommend!!",

But when you lay down it's much much more firm. I bought this just because it was cheap and I could get it quickly but it's so good we are keeping this for our master bedroom!",
