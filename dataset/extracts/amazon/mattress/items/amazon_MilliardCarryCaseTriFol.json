It is easy to open up all the way then fold the mattress and set it on top and zip the cover. It is sturdy and seems like it will keep dust out. You can even fit a basic mattress cover on the mattress when storing it away. My 78 year old mom slept on the folding mattress on top of a raised air mattress so it would be easier for her to get on and off the bed. It worked really well and she said it was comfortable for her. The mattress case allows us to put away the mattress when not in use, and you can sit on the mattress when it is in the case because it is sturdy and holds it's shape and can be used as a sort of couch. I would recommend this mattress and case to others. Thank you.",
