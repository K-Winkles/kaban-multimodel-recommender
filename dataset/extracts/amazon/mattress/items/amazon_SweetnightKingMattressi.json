                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have been sleeping on this mattress for quite some time and is very comfortable. Prior to this I purchased the 10\u201d king sized mattress and I decided to upgrade our guestroom and thought that the master could have a couple extra inches of cushion. Here are some differences between the 10\u2019 and the 12\u201d Prior to making any decisions I would highly suggest going into a store and trying out different types of mattresses to find out your ideal comfort style.Once, you find one that you like look for similar ones online, a mattress in a box has evolved from where it began and you can get a high-quality mattress delivered to your home at a fraction of the cost to purchase one in a store.Both the 12\u201d and 10\u201d mattresses offer motion isolation, but if you share a bed with a very restless sleeper, I would suggest the 12\u201d simply because you can\u2019t feel any movement whatsoever. The 12\u201d motion isolation is exactly as described and it truly does give you a peaceful undisturbed sleep.Difference:The 10\u201d mattress we purchased was a hybrid and did not have coils, the sweet night 12 inch king mattress is constructed with coils that are said to be \u201cindividually wrapped with innersprings and gel memory foam support,\u201d I didn\u2019t cut open the mattress but I definitely know that this one contains coils and I prefer it, to those without. The topping on the mattress isolates motion but the coils allow for more \u201cbounce\u201d in the mattress itself. The gel memory foam layer slowly adjusts to your body weight, and it provides a buffer so you never feel the coils.Comfort:Both my husband and myself enjoy this particular mattress because he suffers from severe back pain, he has had so much relief from his constant aches and I believe that it is due to the claims of \u201cpressure relief helps those with back pain, tossing & turning\u201dQuality:The quality of the mattress is indisputable, the topper is soft and plush while the bottom allows for a firm support, with a little give. The reason why I like this mattress to such an extreme is because it is the perfect meeting point for people who like firm and soft mattresses. My husband needs the firmness for his back but I need a comfortable bounce to get some rest.There have been no issues of sagging or the mattress losing its shape since we have had it, and it took a very short period of time to set up.The 3-Zone pocket spring is contoured for support and there are independent pocketed springs designed for couples like my husband and I allowing body weight to be evenly absorbed and distributed. Also provides the targeted support to your body, proper back support & alignment.Tips:When initially setting up the mattress use two people (IT IS HEAVY) and be sure that it is laid properly so you can simply roll it out! The mattress arrives compressed, rolled and in a box. Follow the instructions and allow 72 hours for your new mattress to adjust to its original, shape.I am very pleased with this purchase and a getting a goodnights rest is nothing in comparison to the small cost of the mattress! Thank you for allowing us some sleep!",

                "reviewText": "I love this mattress! It is great. I sleep amazingly on it. Had to purchase a new mattress to move out of my old apartment and I\u2019ve never slept better. Was very skeptical, but it really has worked out. It is a good size (queen). No smell. Soft but firm enough (for me). Easy to install. I also had to keep it in the box for about 2-3 weeks while I moved and slept on it the day I opened it and it was absolutely fine. I was surprised pleasantly. I am a big fan of this product for the price, the quality is incredible. Great sleep, amazingly comfortable and just very nice. Takes 2 people to carry the box anywhere if you need to move it, but the give you a letter opener which opens the mattress up easy peasy and you can do that on your own.",

                "reviewText": "First couple of days review.Purchased this to replace a 3.5 year old (\"Sad-Story\") mattress that started sagging close to the edges on both sides, contacting the manufacturer several times was fruitless and frustrating plus Amazon won't allow me to write a poor review...Meh.I have to assume that purchasing a price compatible object post pandemic will result in lower quality overall and regardless of \"list pricing/discount\" this appears to be so.Watching several tube videos illustrating the construction process it becomes difficult to justify spending thousands on a premium mattress with mediocre reviews limited to the same height.The mattress inflated fully within hours however we didn't put it on the frame for 5 days, it rested flat on a floor for that time.This mattress lacks edge support with only a thin layer of fabric on the sides touching the coils, so getting in and out of the bed collapses the side considerably, don't know if this should be a concern about potential issues, just very noticable.It is truly a plush feel, ideal for a side sleeper providing the needed support without feeling one is sinking down into an inescapable abyss. The plush top is nice and comfortable no odor or harshness at all, feels good with just a cotton sheet on it to the touch. The bottom would benefit with more coil support it seems to give a bit much, why am I looking up under the bed you say? Just checking.I will update this as time passes with how it is holding up (we aren't big people).",

For the price you can not beat the easy set up, quality and comfort. Are they the best Mattress on the market. No of coarse not, they don't cost 2k to 4k either. I paid under $400 for each mattress and they are well worth that. Delivery was on time both times i ordered. Nothing bad to say really.",
