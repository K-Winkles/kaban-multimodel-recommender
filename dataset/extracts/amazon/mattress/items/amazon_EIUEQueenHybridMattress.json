It\u2019s so loud? Like a simple move and you hear them springs going off. It\u2019s actually irritating. Careful doing too much in bed if you get this. I feel like I can\u2019t move. 2. It\u2019s not that comfortable tbh. I will never buy another spring bed again after this one (and I grew up on mattresses like this) it makes my back hurt and I\u2019ve never had an issue with beds with similar firmness but now my shoulders and back hurt almost daily. Only thing in my life that\u2019s changed is the mattress.Not much value for money. If you\u2019re in a tight spot it\u2019s good for short term but I honestly just wish I splurged a bit more.

                "reviewText": "So I was quite excited getting a hybrid mattress as this would be my first one. My others have all been spring OR memory.When I first rolled out the mattress, there was a very significant height difference from the left side of the mattress to the right side. There was a deep slope that went down on the right side, and I was afraid the mattress would never even out. THANKFULLY, the mattress did even out after 2 weeks. Before it evened out, I asked my friend to sleep on the left side (as this seemed the more comfortable choice) and I was quite embarrassed by this. She was a good sport, though. I think the trick was to lay on it from time to time as days went by to get the springs to spring all the way up eventually. I think I did hear some \"boing\" sounds; as if the springs were finally bouncing up in the right side. It did not rise to 10 inches. Mine only went up 8.75 inches like so many others in the review.It's nothing fancy, but it's definitely good enough for my guest room. It's a firm mattress so I did get a medium poofy topper for it so it wasn't so firm. I'm just glad the whole thing evened out, otherwise I was going to donate it.",

Spring sold up pretty dang well at least out of the box, and me and the misses have done some rigorous testing. Fits true to a queen bed, and gives decent support but at the same point is still soft. Doesn't allow you or retain heat very well so you're not going to get roasting, at least not here in Florida.",
