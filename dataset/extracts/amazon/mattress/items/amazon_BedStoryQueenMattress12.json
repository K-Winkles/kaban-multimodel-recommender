                "reviewText": "I got this mattress for guest bedroom use. I personally prefer a softer mattress but I'm not the one who's going to sleep on it. On a firmness scale of 1-10 ,10 being the most firm, I like a 2-3. My husband likes at least a 7. Id rate this mattress about a 6-7 from my initial interaction with it. I'm a side sleeper who suffers pressure points on hips and shoulders when a mattress is too firm, so the foam layer helps reduce that to some degree. I currently sleep on a hybrid that I'm comparing this mattress to. My original mattress has a 4 inch thick foam layer, this one is half that contributing to that firmer feeling. If you like a firmer mattress, you should like this one. The springs give you that sense of being well supported while the foam gives a little extra cushion so you don't feel like you are sleeping on a rock.This is a typical bed in a box as far as setup goes. It does need time to breathe and relax after unboxing. Setup is the same as any other bed in box. The materials feel like good quality. I didn't notice anything in the construction that would cause me concern. It's a good value for what it is. Hybrid mattress can be very expensive and usually triple (or more) the price of this one. Based on my initial impression, the overall quality and especially the price, I rate this 5 stars for a good value.",

                "reviewText": "We got this mattress as a budget mattress to replace our old guest room mattress that is sagging. I ended up sleeping for quite a few nights on it. For the price, it is definitely beyond my expectation. I prefer firmer mattresses. While this is not a firm as I did like (probably 6-6.5 out of 10, 7.5 to 8 out of 10 would probably be ideal for me), the mattress is very comfortable and very supportive. I can't speak about the isolation of motion, as I slept on it by myself. The comfort and support is quite uniform across the entire mattress. You will need a few days to let the mattress expand to its full firmness, as I definitely see the difference between day one and day three. But overall, if you like medium firmness, this mattress is of great value for the comfort level. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "This might be my favorite mattress ever!!. It's firm when you sit on the bed, but it conforms to your body when you lie down. I loved it, last evening and I look forward to night number two, tonight. I was sleeping on a night double for a good while, now, and I thought that a queen wouldn't mean that much more to me. I was wrong!! Those extra inches, for a man that's 6'2\" make all the difference ... width and length. The springs are added support and that layer of memory foam matters. You will love this mattress. One word of caution ... open it in the room it's going to go. Once it starts to inflate, it is not a lightweight mattress.",

                "reviewText": "Be careful when unwrapping this mattress! It\u2019s wrapped several times so it takes some time and finesse cutting through it (can\u2019t really use a box-cutter due to the risk of slicing the fabric) with scissors.Since it\u2019s vacuum sealed and trying to inflate while it\u2019s being opened, when there was only a small amount of plastic left, it burst fully open(unrolled itself) due to the pressure and luckily mostly went in the other direction! \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019d recommend opening it in the center of the bed frame or box spring so it can spring open in a safe area.Just make sure kids or pets aren\u2019t around the area where it\u2019s being opened!It was 11\u201d as soon as it unfolded, and 12\u201d in some spots an hour later. Two days later now though and no change. It\u2019s still 11.5-12 inches (measures differently in different spots 12\u201d is the tallest) I hope it\u2019ll finish fluffing up to it\u2019s full 14\u201d after a few days but I don\u2019t see how since it\u2019s hasn\u2019t risen an additional fraction of an inch. Will update!The topside of the mattress is really beautiful. The underside is that very thin cheap felt material, the same kind usually stapled to the underside of box springs. Easy enough to replace or repair if it tears, but I suppose I was expecting a bit of a nicer finish on the bottom side.As far as comfort, it\u2019s already comfortable sans the final inch of floof! Pretty firm but also soft. We use mattress toppers so we prefer the firmer mattresses since they seem to last much longer.It fit on my full size platform bed frame perfectly. The handles on the sides were VERY helpful to get it into place and to lift the mattress a bit to adjust the bed-skirt that shifted underneath while getting it into place.",

                "reviewText": "This mattress is a hybrid one, meaning it has both memory foam on top, and stiff springs underneath, like a traditional mattress does. Still, unboxing it and setting it up takes time because the foam and the mattress itself has to fully inflate back to its prescribed size of 12 inches. The mattress takes about 2-3 days to inflate, which is a long time for some, but it's well required in order to gain its maximum size back. It arrives vacuum sealed and shrunken, and in a slim box, so you do the math. Still, once it's set up it is comfortable and provides a lot more support than a pure foam mattress does. My parents like it more than their aged one, so I'm happy with it.",
