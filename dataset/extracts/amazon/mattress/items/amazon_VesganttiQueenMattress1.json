Make sure you follow the instructions when opening the seal to avoid injury and damage to the mattress. It comes in a box rolled up and compressed in a plastic bag. I'm amazed at how they were able to do this and have it expand to its normal size and shape like it came straight from the store! It feels like an all-in-one mattress too with the springs, memory foam, mattress pad and other layers of materials at a great value! Hopefully it holds up for several years!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first purchase of a mattress in a box. I had watched some videos about how to safely expand the mattress and the process for this went very smoothly. It is twin size, so not that hard for me to do it by myself. I've slept on it for five nights and it great for me. I have had 4 spine surgeries and am in constant pain, so a night on a bad mattress is a dreadful experience. This is definitely what I would call a firm mattress, but for me it is perfect. It looks very well made and this 8\" height with my new 14\" high bed frame makes it the most comfortable and safe height for getting in and out of bed.I looked a some furniture store/mattress store mattresses that were usually 3 to 5 times the price of this one, and now that I have this one I cannot see spending what the brick & mortar stores are charging. I chose this brand based on reviews and looks like I got a winner. I immediately put a mattress cover on it, which I highly recommend. If you think you prefer a squishy mattress, then this is probably not for you, but for folks that know a firm mattress is what they need I can recommend this. This review is for the twin size, so I can't say what a larger size is like.",

I will say it is FIRM, I added a pillow top and it made the mattress absolutely perfect for my husband and I. I definitely suggest giving it an hour or two to inflate before you lay/sit on it. We\u2019ve had it about a week and it\u2019s fully inflated and it was true to size, fit over my box springs perfectly! It\u2019s definitely worth the money you spend and I see this bed lasting us a while. Happy with my purchase!",

I am AMAZED!!!! THIS MATTRESS IS TRULY BOUNCY! LOVE IT!!!!!! and the handles on the side helped me to place it ..... I am pushing 80 years old; AND though the mattress is heavy and sturdy; I could move it to fit perfectly with no effort. Solid and SUPREME.",

It comes with a tool to cut the plastic that keeps the mattress rolled and as soon as you do, the mattress unrolls and uncompresses fast. Mine rose up to the full height almost instantly. I didn't have the frame yet since this came in so quickly but I already took a nap on it and it feels great.",

                "reviewText": "After one day. So far so good.The mattress is mostly springs. The top section of the mattress that is between two hems that is greyblue is not just foam but is still mostly 98% spring. I can't say that there is much foam at all there. So, the product photos on Amazon made it look like there were was much more foam.What I'm looking for is support like a half filled air mattress with a memory foam top without the flat/limp feel when moving on it or sitting on it. In essence I want the mattress to fill in the parts with support of the body where there is less mass and higher points and cushion the heavier mass and lower points of the body. So that's why I chose a hybrid mattress with individual springs.I hope to update this as I sleep on it more. However with it mostly just being springs and less foam than I thought I may have to put at least a 2-in foam topper on it.-- After 3 nights on it I had to definitely put a foam topper on it. It's a very firm mattress. I am on a solid platform. In a way I like it but it's not what I was looking for initially.-----Okay so it's been a bit more time. I really like this mattress yet it might not be the best for me being a restless sleeper. I might need foam only.For me the spring/hybrid mattress is fun to lay on with more of a free feeling to it compared to just foam because the only foam mattresses seem to hold me more in place. However, for me that memory foam hold in place is good because I am less resless.However, the difference I feel is more push on my lower back and butt on this hybrid maybe because I'm not sinking in the same way on just foam and It took a week to get used to that. I switched back to a new foam for a night and slept really good and woke up without any issues right away. This mattress took me longer to get used to than foam.Another thing though between only foam and this hybrid is you can always add a memory foam pad to the spring/hybrid later where adding more foam pad to an only foam mattresses may be a bit too much foam. I tried it.What I do like about this mattress is the cotton covering around it and it does not smell like foam only mattresses.----After a bit more time, I've bounced between a foam mattress and this one and I'm reconsidering and have decided that I like this one much more because of its back support feel. I feel more aligned with this mattress.",

For kids and normal-sized guests? This is a great option.",
