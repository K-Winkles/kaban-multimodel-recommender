I was surprised when it showed up and the mattress was rolled up in a smaller box.I had read other reviews about this mattress and those ratings and reviews led me to buy this. They all mentioned to be careful when slow when opening it as it might pop out. I heeded that advice and am glad I did. Please be careful and slow to avoid it unrolling and popping out.Once it was unrolled, directions were super easy to follow. Just it breathe for 8-72 hours (the longer the better) and you can sleep.This mattress is incredibly comfortable and supportive. It's not too soft or firm. I don't feel like I'm sinking and sleeping on quicksand on it but also doesn't feel like I'm sleeping on the pavement. This mattress is the perfect balance and I cannot believe I got it on Amazon for such a low price. I definitely will be getting another when the time comes for a new one!",

                "reviewText": "I am writing this after using this product for 4 months. The worst ever product and all wrong information on the description. It now damaged my health, it badly injured my shoulder and back muscle. Never had a good sleep but I thought I will get used to it. Could not return as its another headache to return mattress after you open it. Please read following points which are absolutely WRONG in the production description mentioned by the company.1.Pocket Spring for Better Support - Company is not honest here. Every place you put ur hand or foot or your back you will feel like that part is dropping inside. No support at all.2.Premium Material for Health: - They mentioned its friendly for kids and pregnant lady. Its. BIG NOOOO. Please do not buy it for your kids neither for pregnant lady. It will damage them heavily and badly.3.Suitable for All Sleepers: - NOOOO, not true. Buy this product only if you lobe to sleep on a trampoline or you are buying it for jumping purpose.4.Motion Isolation for Soundly Sleep: - Ohh GOD, its completely wrong information. The product does opposite to it.They offer 100 night trial, but its my bad I didn't realize it and could not return this. and now am writing it only after I got sever pain due to this mattress. But still I will try to contact their support.But please stay away from this particular mattress as it will severely damage your health. I will look for options to sue this company for selling this product with wrong information.",

We've been sleeping more comfortably since the first night, although I did also invest in a nice mattress topper as well. Hopefully the longevity is there, only time will tell.",
