And when I move (again) since I don't own a house, I can just fold this up and take it with me. Good for a minimalist couch. I like how you can set it up into a chair couch as well. It came in at 7am, I put blankets on it, and fell asleep for 5 hours \ud83d\ude05 it's so comfy and you can't feel the creases. It lays evenly and is very thick. I absolutely love it :) and it was in my price range. There are other foldable couches but they are in the $300 range and this one was much less and the value is great!",

                "reviewText": "So, my mom had a folding floor mattress when we were kids, and we used it for sleepovers all the time. I've wanted something similar of my own forever, so I was happy to stumble upon this. This feels pretty nice to lay on, but I took off a star because 1) When you first kneel down on it to get on it, your knee sinks to the floor (I think it could be firmer in that regard... although when your weight is distributed, it's fine), and 2), it's actually kind of large to store. My mom's folded in half and could be slid under the bed. Unless your bed frame is super high off the ground, this isn't sliding under your bed unless it's opened all the way up. It's also a little big to shove into a closet. Definitely more comfortable than an air mattress (in my opinion), and I love the fact that, unlike an air mattress, it won't deflate in the night. Love that you don't have to take the time or effort to blow it up (like an air mattress); you just unfold it, and you're good to go.",

                "reviewText": "I have 3 kids, and they are all at the age of wanting to have sleepovers every other weekend. We don't have a blow up mattress, and I ordered this thinking it would be convenient to store and pull out whenever we need it. It's really exactly what I was hoping. It's comfortable once made up with blankets and a pillow, and fits an average sized adult. This would not be suitable for those who are overweight or very tall. My husband is 6 feet tall and his feet hang off a little unless his head is at the very top edge. I'm very happy with it though and it's already been used successfully. I love how easy it is to fold up and put away, it stows away under a bed or in a closet with no issue.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good size for a smaller adult or a child. Someone over 6 feet tall would probably not find it roomy enough. Also, a heavier person might not be super comfortable sleeping on it directly on the floor, but it works well for a small child. It is a great mat for floor exercises too. I love it because there is so much cushion. I love that it folds up quickly for storage too. I just stick it beside my weight stand, and it's there the next time I need it. Best of all is the washable and removable cover!!! That is a game changer. Even though I use it for exercise, I can easily wash it to use as my granddaughter's nap mat.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a full-time mattress to sleep on - this isn't it. But, if you're looking for a nice comfortable pad to sleep on occasionally, this is fantastic. It's far more comfortable than an air mattress. I had a sick dog recently that couldn't be moved. We placed her on this mattress and I was still able to lay down beside her to comfort her. She was comfortable and so was I. I've also found that this fits perfectly on top of my cot - making it a great temporary bed for guests.",

It's as long as a queen-sized bed in length and folds in three. It was quite bigger than I imagined. I wanted it for (1) a very tiny space in my house to serve as a sleeping area when there's extra company and (2) I can easily take it in the car with me on road trips. I slept on it for a few hours and it is comfortable. Good quality!\ud83d\udcafFor it's weight/size, I wish it had the following for when it's not in use:-1. A storage/carry bag2.
