I unrolled the mattress onto the bed frame before piercing the vacuum seal which made it easier to position. Seems like it should wear well. Would highly recommend.",

It's a budget-friendly option for those who need a new mattress without breaking the bank.Hybrid Design: The combination of memory foam and springs is a major plus. The memory foam conforms to the body, providing decent comfort and support, while the springs add a traditional mattress feel.Ease of Setup: The mattress comes compressed and rolled in a box, making it easy to set up. It expands quickly once unwrapped.Cons:Comfort Level: While the mattress is comfortable, it doesn't quite reach the luxurious feel of some higher-end models. It's sufficient for a good night's sleep but may not satisfy those looking for premium comfort.Durability: Given its price point, I have some reservations about its long-term durability. It seems sturdy enough for now, but time will tell how it holds up.Firmness: The mattress leans towards the firmer side. If you prefer a plush, deeply cushioned feel, this might not be the mattress for you.Conclusion: The Sofree Bedding Full Size Mattress is a solid choice for anyone looking for a basic, no-frills mattress. It's great as a starter mattress or for a guest room. The hybrid design offers a balance of comfort and support, making it a versatile choice. However, if you're seeking a mattress with advanced features or ultra-soft comfort, you might want to explore other options. For its price, it's a commendable choice, especially for those on a tight budget.",

I bought this in a full size for a guest room. Not only did it arrive within 2 days, it came in a box that was easy to carry up the stairs of a tiny house. It was easy to set up. Unboxed it, and let it sit a few days. It\u2019s firm, comfortable, and definitely far better quality that I ever would have imagined. I\u2019d definitely buy this again!!! Might get one for my own bed\u2026",
