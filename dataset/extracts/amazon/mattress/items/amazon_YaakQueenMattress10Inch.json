The memory foam in this mattress is exceptionally comfortable, and the internal structure provides excellent support. The thickness of the mattress is just right, and the size is perfect for my room. Prolonged hours of desk work have intermittently caused lower back pain for me. However, after sleeping on this mattress for a few nights, I feel comfortable throughout my entire back, and I wake up in the morning without any soreness. I am particularly satisfied with this purchase.",

The hybrid design does make a difference from the traditional spring mattress and this is definitely worth the money. It has great support and doesn\u2019t come with any weird smells. I returned my previous mattress due to the weird smell it came with, and this one doesn\u2019t have this issue at all. I would definitely rate this a 10/10 purchase.",
