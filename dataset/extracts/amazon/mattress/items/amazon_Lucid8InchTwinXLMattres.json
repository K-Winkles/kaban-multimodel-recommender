                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Lucid 8 Inch Queen Firm Memory Foam Mattress, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This mattress has completely transformed my sleep experience for the better.First and foremost, the firmness level is just right. It provides the perfect amount of support for my back, ensuring a comfortable and restful night's sleep. I wake up feeling refreshed and without any aches or pains.The 8-inch thickness strikes a great balance between support and plushness. It's not too thin to feel the underlying structure, yet not too thick that it compromises the supportive feel of a firm mattress. The memory foam contours to my body, offering a personalized and cozy sleeping environment.One of the standout features for me is the breathability of the mattress. The memory foam is infused with cooling gel, which helps regulate temperature throughout the night. No more waking up in a sweat \u2013 this mattress keeps me cool and comfortable all night long.Setting up the mattress was a breeze. It arrived in a compact box, and once I opened it, it expanded to its full size within a few hours. The quality of materials used is evident, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the construction.As a bonus, the Lucid mattress comes with a soft and breathable cover that is easy to remove and clean. This adds an extra layer of convenience and ensures that my mattress stays fresh over time.In conclusion, if you're in the market for a firm memory foam mattress, the Lucid 8 Inch Queen is an excellent choice. It combines the perfect level of firmness, support, and comfort for a great night's sleep. I highly recommend this mattress to anyone looking to upgrade their sleep experience.",

                "reviewText": "I like Lucid brand and had my last one for ten years, I loved it up until the ten year mark. Maybe my preferences have changed and I can\u2019t handle plush mattresses anymore.Anyway, I do believe that at this price point it\u2019s actually a good mattress. I read some of the reviews and I have to say, it deserves better reviews.It\u2019s actually really good quality, if you have a very low budget. It amazes me that anyone would buy a mattress at this price and have anything to complain about. I feel that there should at least be gratitude for the fact that we can purchase any mattress at this low of a price point. If you want something better then keep saving until it can be afforded, otherwise maybe buy a used mattress off of FB marketplace.Anyway, my experience was -1. The mattress wasn\u2019t nearly as firm as I expected. Again, that was my own thought and expectations. It just gave too much for me. Which I can say some might love that it cradles them! Maybe it gave so much because I\u2019m pregnant and weigh an extra 40 lbs, which puts me at 190 lbs. So maybe just not great for a heavier body.2. I wish I had bought a ten or twelve inch instead. I think that would have helped.3. No smell at all and was very cleanly packed.Bottom line - if you\u2019re a lighter person and you need a low profile mattress and you also like to sink a bit, this one might be perfect for you.We bought it because we were In between moving, getting a new mattress and waiting for our Satviaa to be delivered.It served its purpose for a few weeks but now my nephew has it. He\u2019s about 6 feet tall and 140lbs & he LOVES it! He said it\u2019s so comfortable.To each their own\u2026I\u2019m happy with the purchase and super fast delivery.Thanks Lucid, for providing affordable comfort and a great low cost.",

Too firm if you have Fibromyalgia like I do. But I love it. So I ordered a mattress topper to lessen the hardness on my body. Especially my shoulders when side sleeping because I had a bad fall years ago and injured my shoulder and back. But if you are looking for Firm then this is the mattress for you. No regrets and I highly recommend. It inflated fully in less than 2 days. There was Never any Smell at all. I'm happy I went with my gut instinct to try it out.Update: I purchased the mattress topper and it definitely took the edge off of my Fibromyalgia and Back pain.",
