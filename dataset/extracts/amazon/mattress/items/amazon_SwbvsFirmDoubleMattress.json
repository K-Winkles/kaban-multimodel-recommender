                "reviewText": "My first terrible experience with Amazon. This is the first time purchasing a large size item from Amazon. Mattress purchased was received on Dec 22nd and does not match its product description. This is not a firm mattress as stated and there is no memory foam feeling when on it. You feel the coils!Scheduled a return on the Dec 23rd and Amazon confirmed pickup outside my home Dec 27th. This is a king mattress that I took the day off to push out of my bedroom alone into the entrance only to see Amazon canceled the pickup with no notification to me!!! I will never buy large items from them again. Impossible to get assistance over the phone and now the pickup is scheduled for Dec 28th but I don\u2019t know if my job will give me the day on short notice. This has been so frustrating and all out disappointing experience.",

It isn\u2019t as thick / lush as the mattress I replaced with this, and wished they had that option and it\u2019s a bit squeaky when you sit on the sides of it. I\u2019m still amazed at how compressed this was on delivery however it bounced right into shape with I an hour (even though they say it might take up to 72hrs). I was not disappointed. Well worth the $",

                "reviewText": "I found it difficult to pick out a mattress online because the feedback is so subjective and varied for each brand and size. This one also had its share of mixed reviews so I was hesitant, but in the end it was worth it.Although it is suggested that you wait up to 72 hours for the mattress to decompress, we only waited about 6 hours, and it was great. Absolutely no smell whatsoever, took about 10 seconds to decompress, came with a small tool to slice the bag open safely and was delivered right to our door by Purolator Courier.We\u2019ve been sleeping on it for a few nights now and I certainly do not feel the coils at all. The top is extremely soft and you sink in ever so slightly. This isn\u2019t a firm or a soft mattress, it\u2019s a medium firmness which is exactly what we wanted. I have my best night sleep now that we\u2019ve changed mattresses and I would definitely purchase this again in a heartbeat.There is very little movement for my partner when I toss at night. I also find the mattress fairly quiet with minimal squeaking from the springs.A great product overall for less than $300, so happy we chose this one!",
