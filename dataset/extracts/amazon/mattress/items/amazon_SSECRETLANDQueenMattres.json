The price made me think that the mattress would be a low quality. I WAS WRONG!! I love this mattress! I got the medium firm and 14\" mattress, after reading some reviews. I do sleep in the same spot most nights. There has been no \"nest built\" in that spot. The mattress is firm, but not concrete firm. I sleep very well and comfortable. Also, I don't get hot. For reference, I am 5'8 and weigh 210lbs.",

                "reviewText": "Quick review: didn\u2019t smell, expanded fully in 24 hours, sleeps great, no noise.Long review: This is the cheapest queen mattress I could find on Amazon. I knew it was gonna be either really hit or miss but this thing is on the money for the price.I opened it up and let it inflate for about 2 days. It had a nice smell but you could only smell it if you put your nose up to it. No overwhelming pungent factory smell.The first night I slept on it, I woke up really refreshed. Mind you, I came from a mattress that\u2019s about 25 years old and I was convinced I\u2019d never find a mattress more comfortable than it. I sleep on my back, sides, stomach and I toss and turn. I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and 190 lbs and this thing has completely exceeded my expectations for what I paid. I put a cheap slat bed frame under it and a couple memory foam cooling pillows from Ross and i actually felt like I needed to turn the heat on in the middle of the night because the bed & pillows had stayed so cold.My only gripe is if you sit on the edge of the bed getting ready in the morning it does sink in. Otherwise, it\u2019s very comfortable and stays nice and cool as I get hot very easily.9/10. I would recommend this mattress to any one not looking to pay for big name mattresses.",

                "reviewText": "Alright, I\u2019m 22, 5\u20196, and 140 on a bad day. I sleep like a goob, I\u2019m not going to lie. I toss and turn all night, mostly a side and stomach sleeper, but I dabble in back sleeping in the wee hour before my alarm comes on. This is NOT a soft mattress. I have the 10 inch because I am nothing if not a bargain hunter, and honestly she\u2019s not a cloud. She\u2019s more like if you put a cloud over a nice bed of concrete. I reckon that means there\u2019s a medium amount of give here. For side and stomach sleepers? Pretty chill, no complaints, I\u2019m having a great time. It\u2019s supportive and kind, but definitely more firm for these positions.Now for back sleepers? Lord have mercy, I WISH I was a back sleeper on this mattress. Now let\u2019s be clear, I am a relatively small woman, so I can\u2019t speak for those above my realm of weight and give, but I will say it is soft and firm in the right places all around my town. It has a wonderful give for the curve of my back while it also supports all my non-curved areas. 1000/10 recommend for my girlies that want a Goldilocks kind of fit for their back.Other important information:I let it fluff for 48 hours but it was pretty much done in 12. It does have an aroma of curated factory with a hint of chemicals upon opening, but the vacuum-sealed packaging is so cool it kind of makes up for the smell. Further, the smell went away fairly quickly. VERY soft to the touch in case you\u2019re the variety of heathen that prefers to sleep without sheets, and most importantly it was super heavy to move around, so I\u2019d recommend a trusted friend and confidant to lug this up your stairs. You could probably scoot it if you\u2019re able-bodied and alone\u2026 in a single story house.All in all, it\u2019s a pretty solid mattress.",

Incredibly comfortable fun to set up (it comes in a box and then BAM, BED).I was cautiously optimistic I let that bad boy do it's expansion and have not looked back. My husband even abandoned the sleep number bed. When our situation is fixed I plan to buy another one for the Master Bedroom.",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered this mattress from Amazon as I was looking for a new mattress after I got rid of my old one. The nice thing about this mattress is that it delivers pretty quickly and it has a range of options for what size mattress you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s also pretty comfortable but it is very basic. It does not come with a boxspring and it\u2019s pretty flimsy therefore it\u2019s kind of difficult to move around if you have to take it off the bed at any point. I personally would recommend getting a mattress topper to put on top of this because it\u2019s kind of a thin mattress but it\u2019s not entirely necessary. it also has a nice medium firmness to it to appease those who like a firm or a soft type bed.",
