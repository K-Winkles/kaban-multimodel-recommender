                "reviewText": "It's more firm then I'm used to in a bed but it's definitely not uncomfortable, I'm 26 and my back usually hurts when waking up first thing in the morning but since having this bed that has stopped. I'm a tummy sleeper so I am guessing the firmness of the bed is helping with my spin not being all sort of curved at night.. my boyfriend and we're sharing a full sized bed since when we first got together and it was just to cramped and got tired of it after 3 1/2 years, I found this bed for a great price and took my chances. We havent slipped so good since when we first started dating there is so much room and so comfortable after getting adjusted to it. We've had it about a month and half now it's so hard to get out of bed in the morning for work.",

Fit perfectly on my bed frame. I ordered the firm twin size. Paid extra for shipping, but that was okay. I bought this brand before and liked it. It is comfortable and I sleep very well on it.",

I\u2019m used to softer ones and wasn\u2019t sure if this would work for my back of many surgeries. Surprisingly enough I can actually lay on my back without pain. Not the most comfortable when I\u2019m laying on my side. All in all it is a good product",
