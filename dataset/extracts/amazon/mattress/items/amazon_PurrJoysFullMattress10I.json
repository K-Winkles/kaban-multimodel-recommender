My back doesn\u2019t be in pain, but most times I would turned my mattres around, I brought a box spring and frame at the store, and the guy had put up the mattress and put the cover on it to protect from bed bugs coming, the shipping was very fast to, it was so fast because I had it to have two people put the mattress on my new box spring. It\u2019s a bit thickness Around the sides, the appearance is well put together, some times it sinks but not all the time. My sis loves how my bed feels.",
