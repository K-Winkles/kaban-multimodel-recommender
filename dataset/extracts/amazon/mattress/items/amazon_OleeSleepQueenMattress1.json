                "reviewText": "I will update this after 3 months, 6 months and a year. I am 5'10 and weigh 335 lbs. We removed the mattress from it's shipping box and rolled the well packed item to the bedroom. Absolutely no chemical smells at all. Using a traditional oak bed frame and box spring we put it on it and opened the package. Easily done, it gently sprang to life. It was 11 1/2\" deep and after 6 hrs. of rest opened to 12 1/2\". As I had no real choice I had to use it for the night. OMG so soft, but firm. I have sciatica so I was hoping this would help. After a week I can truthfully say I'm no worse and have spent every night in comfort. The only complaint I have is the mattress doesn't really have a firm \"edge\" to sit on, I have to kind of roll into the middle. Looking at it each morning and measuring I find it springs back to it's original shape. Perhaps at a later date it might not considering my excess weight, but we shall see. I haven't noticed any \"overheating\" either because of the material. So far its been money well spent for a wonderful, comfortable nights rest. I have been through two $1000 mattresses in 5 years, so this is a bargain if I onlybuy a few of these. Don't be afraid of the horror stories about unwrapping and setting up, the package arrived UPS in good condition. See you later.****UPDATE-3 MONTHS**** A solid 12\" all around, still firm like I need it. No noticeable smell from day 1 or now. No lumps developing on it either. We reverse the mattress every 30 days and all is, as it was the first week. With my weight is the \"real\" test. Still comfortable and keeps me happy. See you at the end of 6 months.****UPDATE 6 MONTHS**** Everything still great. No complaints, still 12\"+ and no bumps or lumps. ****UPDATE 9 MONTHS****Still 12\", no lumps or bumps, enjoying a restful sleep. I do rotate it once a month as a precaution. See you at the end of 12 months****UPDATE 1 YEAR****All is well, still going strong, very pleased. I'll buy again if this EVER wears out !!!***** UPDATE 15 Months*****All is well, still going strong.*****UPDATE 18 Months*****Still retains its original features, money well spent.*****UPDATE 2 YEARS, 2 MONTHS*****Still comfortable, now weigh 350 lb. No lumps or bumps, (on the matteress)*****UPDATE 3 YEARS, 6 MONTHS, Getting a little lumpy in places, move it around hides it, unfortunately I am now 370 lb. but still happy to get a great, restful sleep",

                "reviewText": "I'll start with why I chose this mattress out of the thousands to choose from online and in store. My first and most important priority was something that would alleviate my lower back problems. I have longstanding back issues and I needed something that would help with the stiffness in my back and hips. My previous spring mattress was a firm but I liked the support. I found some relief on my boyfriend's mattress, but found that his was a tad too plush, that it did not properly support my pressure points and I'd even wake up with numbness sometimes. I would classify his as a medium-plush to medium. His mattress is a hybrid spring, just like this one with the memory foam layer that is much like a topper. I am not too fond of straight memory foam mattresses because I have yet to find one with the proper support and I personally believe that they hold their shape less longer over time than a spring mattress. So as I researched for a hybrid spring mattress with a deep depth, I went through several websites, vendors, and reviews. I came really close to purchasing two other extremely similar mattresses to this one on this same app, and wayfair. What it ultimately boiled down to and what made me decide on this one was the amount of positive reviews it had and the price point. The price combined with the amount of people who are satisfied with this hybrid spring mattress, just can't be beat. I told myself that if I'm going to take a gamble on buying a mattress online and get a horrible mattress, I'd rather beat myself up over losing out on $240 as opposed to $500 or even $1000. So I convinced myself to bet on this one, and hoped that the odds would be in my favor and so far so good!I was a little wary of these new mattresses that come compressed in a box. The box was too heavy for me, someone with back issues, to take up a flight of stairs. There was no chemical smell at all. As soon as we removed the about three layers of packaging, it immediately began to grow! After about an hour, I would say it was 75% there. 24 hours later, I felt that the corners still needed time as the directions state to wait the full 48 hours before putting any weight on the mattress. It was about 90% there, and although my boyfriend insisted we should try it out already, I stood firm and told him no we should wait the full 48 and I'm glad we did! We've slept on it for the past week now on the floor as we wait to purchase a new bed set and it's like a dream. I wake up with no back issues whatsoever, no numbness, nothing! It hugs my hips in a way that is supportive, but not too firm, yet not too plush. Ever since messing up my back, I am not able to lay on my back for an extended period of time. I'm a side sleeper. But I've found that I can even fall asleep on my back with this mattress, and I haven't been able to do that in years! My boyfriend is a big guy, and his side is not uneven or sunken in any way. Now my only concern will be if this mattress will stand up to the test of time because unfortunately I cannot give my word on that yet but I'm very impressed and hopeful so far! If anything changes, I will edit this review. I'll give an update in 6 months to see where we're at with the mattress. If you're looking at this mattress and you've researched for weeks like I did, I say go ahead and take a chance on it, because you won't be able to find such a cheap hybrid spring mattress anywhere else with so many great reviews. If I had to rate the firmness of it, I'd say it is between a medium and firm, a medium-firm if you will (on a scale of plush-medium-firm). I tried to measure it with an old school ruler (as shown in pictures) and I'd say it's a solid 12 inches, probably not 13 but honestly I'm so satisfied with the comfort of the mattress, that the exact depth is the least of my worries.EDIT AFTER OVER A YEAR: We've had this mattress over a year now, and it's still going strong! Hasn't sunken in anywhere and it is still as comfortable as the first day we got it. I wish I knew a long time ago that it was my old mattress that was not allowing me to sleep on my back, when I thought it was just me. I fall asleep like a baby on my back now, and I didn't think that would ever be possible again due to my back issues, but now I see I was just sleeping on the wrong mattress. I can't recommend this one enough!",
