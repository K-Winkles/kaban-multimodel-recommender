The mattress is wonderfully comfortable, offering a great combination of support from the springs and softness from the memory foam. It conforms to my body, providing relief and comfort throughout the night.The medium firmness is perfect for me. It's not too hard nor too soft, just the right level of firmness to support my body without feeling like I'm sleeping on a rock. The raw cotton fabric cover is a nice touch, it feels soft and adds to the overall comfort.I was a bit skeptical about buying a mattress online, but the value for money with this one is incredible. It\u2019s given me quality sleep at a fraction of the cost of high-end mattresses. Setting it up was simple, and watching it expand after unboxing was quite fun.

                "reviewText": "A soft and comfortable mattress can provide a high-quality sleep experience, and fortunately, I have found such a mattress. It is a hybrid mattress, consisting of multiple supportive layers. The super-elastic fabric is very breathable, enhancing comfort and airflow. Previously, I would feel hot at night, but since using this mattress, I wake up feeling refreshed. The pressure-relieving memory foam is temperature-sensitive and perfectly conforms to my body's curves to alleviate pressure. High-density support foam provides good support for the whole body, preventing sagging when lying on the bed. Additionally, it includes fire-retardant foam, high-density base foam, and an individually wrapped coil system. Surprisingly, the mattress also has an inner spring system. Such a high-quality mattress makes me never want to leave the bed; it's just too soft and comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "Unboxing the SIMARTH Full Mattress was an experience in itself \u2013 compactly packaged yet expansive in comfort once laid out. I was skeptical about a mattress that comes rolled up could provide such firm support, but I was pleasantly surprised. The individually pocketed springs adapt to movement with ease, ensuring that my partner's nighttime shuffles don't become my disturbance. The foam layer on top is like the icing on a very comfortable cake, adding that plush feel without the sinking sensation. It's been a valuable addition to my home, delivering restful nights from day one.",
