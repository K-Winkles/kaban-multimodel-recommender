                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Good Bed Makes a Good Difference",
                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t typically write reviews for things I like, or don\u2019t like. If I take the time to write down my opinion it\u2019s generally to complain about truly being disappointed or on rare occasions, like this one, truly amazed. Having my expectations exceeded is a rarity, one in which I\u2019m willing to put my time and words to paper - or screen. This, this is one of those exceptional experiences- and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s over a mattress of all things.Buying a mattress shouldn\u2019t be hard, but it is. It\u2019s made harder by today\u2019s advertising and BS. We no longer know what the best way is to buy the thing we\u2019ve bought our whole life. Are we being ripped off? The answer is of course yes; but how do we solve that? The answer in this case is Zinus.Perhaps embarrassingly, I put more research into my latest mattress purchase than I did my last car. Maybe because it\u2019s such a personal purchase and one you live with for such a long period of time. What you sleep on, and how you sleep, matters. A decade ago I bought my last mattress. It was a good mattress. It was very expensive. It served me well\u2026 for a few years. I extended it\u2019s life far past it\u2019s usefulness by adding memory foam and padding and then again by telling myself it was sufficient, for years.After at least a year of restless nights which I attributed to other causes I finally admitted to myself I needed a new bed. What a pain, literally. This began my research into what to buy and from where.If you\u2019re looking at a Zinus then you\u2019ve undoubtedly looked at the other major players in this category. They\u2019ve sprung up all in the last couple of years because of one major reason - mattress sales are a scam. Unfortunately, so are online mattress sales for the most part. After a lot of research which you can do in your own time using Google, nearly all these \u2018online mattress companies\u2019 are actually made in the same factory using nearly identical material. They all add in their own exclusive features but they are mostly the same. The major difference being the name on the box it\u2019s shipped in.Zinus is considerably cheaper than the rest. It is nearly identical to the rest. It\u2019s cheaper because they lower their markup. It really is that simple. The big players in this game pretend to offer a great deal but then markup their mattress by 300% or more. Ask yourself why they can afford to let you sleep on it for 3 months, then pay someone to come to your house and take it to the landfill if you don\u2019t want to keep it. They would literally rather pay someone to throw it away than to take it back. That\u2019s how inexpensive it is for them to make them. The markup is so much that their product becomes disposable.This doesn\u2019t mean they are bad mattresses. In fact, all those name brand online retailers sell great mattresses, nearly identical to the Zinus. They are just incredibly overpriced.Now my review - my mattress rant is over. I hope some find it useful.I bought the \u2018Zinus Memory Foam 12 Inch / Premium / Ultra Plush / Cloud-like Mattress, King\u2019. With it I also bought the platform bed from Zinus - also because of the incredible price and which I\u2019ll also review. (spoiler, it\u2019s fantastic)The mattress comes compressed in a box of course. That\u2019s how it works. Unlike some other manufacturers it fully uncompresses and is ready for sleep on day 1. There is no chemical smell because it\u2019s not treated with the same nasty chemicals that some other manufacturers put on theirs. I\u2019ve read a lot of \u2018explanations\u2019 from the other makers as to why they fill theirs with chemicals, none of which are convincing. My guess, is so that they can sit in warehouses for years and not get moldy.This is without a doubt the most comfortable mattress I\u2019ve ever slept on. If it\u2019s comfortable to you will of course depend on what your definition of comfort is. Zinus makes several different mattresses in varying degrees of firmness. I just happened to luck out buying the right one for me the first time, I think. This one is firm, but giving. It\u2019s the kind of mattress where I can roll around on one side and it doesn\u2019t effect my partner on the other side. You don\u2019t feel movement unless it\u2019s right up against you. At the same time it gives slightly, making it very conforming to your body. One of the most important things to me as a person who is generally hot all the time is that it stay cool, and this does. I didn\u2019t realize it until I got this mattress but I believe one of my issues for such a long time, was being hot. I get no heat from this mattress at all.As an example of just how comfortable this mattress is, having not slept in it yet, I also purchased a very expensive and beautiful down mattress topper along with very beautiful, thick, luxurious sheet set. Ultimately I ended up sending all that back because honestly sleeping on the mattress itself with no other bedding under me save a thin fitted sheet is unbelievably comfortable. You\u2019ll want as little as possible between you and the mattress. I\u2019m not sure what I can say that would be more complimentary than that.I\u2019ve had the mattress for a few months now and it really has been life changing. Not in a \u2018save the world\u2019 kind of way - but it has saved my sleep. I sleep well, and for the first time in years. A good bed makes a good difference. I\u2019ve been a tad evangelical about this review only because it\u2019s made such a positive improvement in my life- and for far less money than the alternatives.A few tips:Put your mattress on a VERY firm surface. This isn\u2019t your old traditional mattress, you do not want it on a bed springs. If you can\u2019t buy a platform bed now, put it on the floor.Do not add a bed topper even though your experience with your old mattress may incline you otherwise. Sleep as close to the mattress as you can. No topper, thin sheets.If you don\u2019t believe you can buy a great mattress for hundreds less, buy the more expensive ones first (I did). There is no risk in comparison. Those other brands let you send it back within 90 days at no cost. Buy it, send it back, then buy the Zinus and compare. You can also easily send this back. I\u2019d be absolutely shocked if anyone says they went with the more expensive brand after a comparison.I\u2019m glad you spent the time to read this review. Now, do your research, compare, and buy this mattress.",

There was zero odor but still allowed it to aerate for 3 days. Unfortunately, the corners never extended level with the middle despite tugging on them per manufacturer recommendations. The middle\u2019s final measurement was about 5 1/4 inches with the edges about an inch shorter. Nonetheless, the mattress is very comfortable and my 11 year old is finally getting some great sleep. It is firm which is exactly what we wanted because they normally give a bit with time. She absolutely loves it and was definitely a worthwhile purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I was definitely leery about buying a mattress online. I went to Sam's Club, Mattress Warehouse, Bedding Barn, yadda yadda, and tried a million different mattresses. All of them were lovely, but none of them were cheap. Is this bed stellar? I wouldn't call it that. But it is a wonderful bed for someone who really doesn't want to spend much more than 200$ on a mattress, and someone who certainly doesn't want to try to haul a huge ass mattress on the top of her little Ford Fiesta.PROS -1. Cheap.2. Cheap.3. Cheap. Seriously, where the hell else are you gonna get a decent mattress for this price?4. It comes to your house in a box. You open the box, open a bunch of bags, and the mattress gloriously unfolds for you. After having moved sofas and tables and desks and lamps into my apartment, it was MAGICAL to have something normally so bulky arrive and take pretty much zero work to set up.5. It's a good mattress. I've had it for almost a month now, I sleep well, there's no noticeable comfort issues. Many of the negative reviews I read mentioned that it was too firm, firmer than they were expecting. I think that's because when people think memory foam, they think Temperpedic. See the con section below for more on that, but given all of the complaints about the firmness I was pleasantly surprised with the softness of it. It's firmer than I like, but it does kind of contour to your body. Also, unlike Temperpedic, this mattress doesn't trap all of your body heat! I hate waking up sweaty so this was a huge plus.CONS -1. Smallest con ever: it smells funny for like, 10 minutes after you get it. Really not a big deal though.2. Do not expect this mattress to be a Temperpedic. If you've done any research on mattresses, you'll know that cheaper memory foam mattresses use a cheaper, different density foam than the fancy ass Temperpedics. (If you haven't done research yet, I suggest the Sleep Like the Dead website.) The skinny on these mattresses is that they run firm. And yes, this bed is firmer than I prefer. But see the PRO section above for why this doesn't matter to me that much.3. Now I don't know this first hand, but I have heard that there's really not much you can expect in the way of customer service from this company. And honestly, if you order a bed-in-a-box like this, open it and find out 2 weeks later you really don't like it, what are you going to do? You can't ship it back, because there's no way you can squeeze the mattress back into the box. So I'd suggest trying out a bunch of mattresses, making sure that you're okay with something like this, I would say softer than a firm pillowtop, but firmer than a high density memory foam mattress like Temperpedic. Be REALLY sure you want to buy this before you place an order.ALL IN ALL - This is a good, budget mattress. Generally speaking with mattresses you get what you pay for, but I would say this is a really good deal.",

I was worrying this might feel as cheap as the cot mattress but it's not, it's actually very firm and comfortable. I was surprised and impressed. The price is very good too. With a mattress cover and sheet it smells fine to me, there was a bit of smell at first but went away after a couple days. It's a bit difficult to fold up like a cheap cot mattress of course, but you could if you had straps, or a small rope or whatever to quickly tie it down if you really wanted to. I slept so well when I got this thing and still love it. If you only have a small bed like me, get yourself a high quality mattress like this for a good price it's worth it, we spend so much time sleeping and it's the most important thing for health and well-being.",

                "reviewText": "We have spent thousands of dollars on mattresses in the past 15 years! Within two years a trough in the mattress develops, not deep enough for a warranty, just deep enough to keep you in the trough. Since mattresses are not built to flip these days we have rotated our king-size mattress as recommended and with the same outcome. I am convinced that part of the problem is the two piece box spring. The two pieces box springs support the middle of the mattress exaggerating the trough on either side. Once we removed the box springs and put the 16\" deep mattress on a solid base it was much improved. We should have done that from the start.We decided to risk it with this product! This mattress is one third the price of our former brand name mattresses. It recovered from the compression in the box very nicely and no bothersome odours or smell to speak of. It is firm when you lay on it but within a matter of minutes your body is supported comfortably into the mattress. We cannot say it has solved our back pain but it has certainly improved it. We find it easy to roll over and are please with the support it provides in all sleeping positions. We will have to see what happens with the trough development but at this price it would be hard to complain about!! We are very happy with this mattress after 60 days and would highly recommend it. As an individual interested in sales and marketing presentation, this company is a winner!! Humorous instructions and explanations and very thoughtful and everyday approach. Loved it!!",
