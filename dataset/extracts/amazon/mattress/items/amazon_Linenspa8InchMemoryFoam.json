                "reviewText": "I now have two of these in my home for my two children... I bought my first in September of 2018 to replace an old mattress for my daughter... it was great, and my daughter loved the mattress... no issues at all with the mattress... my son needed a new mattress too, so I was about to order a 2nd one in February 2019 when I noticed numerous reviews (many recent) citing reports of bedbugs.Now let me clarify my experience here... I work in the hospitality business and maintain dormitories for military training students that are on a constant rotation, much like a hotel. We are all trained to spot, look for and deal with bed bugs should ever the problem arise... bed bugs have nothing to do with personal hygene or cleanliness, they can infest anything from the sleaziest no-tell motel to the fanciest 5-star Hyatt Regency. Also, bed bugs don't limit themselves to beds, they will travel and hide on/in anything... clothes, shoes, carpets, suitcases, curtains, laptops, alarm clocks, a book... bed bugs aren't picky. For those reviewers that say they got bedbugs... if you think it came from the mattress and you just tossed it out, problem solved... YOU STILL HAVE BEDBUGS because your house is now infested (or previously was and you just now noticed).Now back to these Linenspa mattresses... I LOVE THESE THINGS... they're very comfortable and affordable... both my kids love them. I had already purchased one back in 2018 and never had any issues, and as someone who can spot those little devils, our house is free of them. When I ordered my 2nd mattress (after reading the negative bug reviews) I went ahead and took the added precaution... and you should too... if you're ever worried about something like this...INSPECT AND OPEN THE MATTRESS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE!I just laid a bedsheet in the driveway, opened the box, inspected the vacuum-sealed wrap... saw nothing... opened it up on the sheet on my driveway (to keep it clean of course) and fully inspected this sucker everywhere... nope... no bugs, no smells... just a nice clean beautiful mattress. Carried it inside, no issues, son happy... If you actually do have one that is infested like some people claim, and you opened it inside and slept on it... ya... your whole house is now infested (and possibly was before you bought a new mattress).I just want to make it clear that as someone who works in the hospitality business and is trained in spotting and dealing with those little devils long before it becomes a problem... I've bought two of these mattresses from this company and never had an issue with bugs or smells... and if I need a third or fourth mattress, i would buy another... but if you ever suspect or worry about something like this from this company, or ANY company... just open it outside on a clean sheet and inspect thoroughly before you bring it in.... that way if there is a problem, you don't risk letting them into your home.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this mattress for my daughter when we upgraded her bed frame. Financially speaking, it's a smart investment. The quality and durability of this mattress at such an accessible price point truly impressed us. It's reassuring to know we've provided our child with a high-quality sleep solution without breaking the bank, which is a big consideration for our large family. Comfort and support were non-negotiable. This mattress delivers on both fronts remarkably well and has lasted 3 years without any wearing down. The memory foam adapts to our daughter's body while the spring base provides the necessary support, ensuring a good night's sleep without compromising on comfort. The mattress is lightweight and was easy for me to move and open on my own. After seeing the quality and durability with our own eyes, we purchased another one for one of our other daughters. Overall we are very pleased with our purchase and would recommend this mattress to fellow parents without hesitation.",

So, I caved and bought the same one again. This time it was 7\" upon opening, and is already almost expanded to 8\". I do not know why my other mattress didn't expand, but I am pleased with this one. It really is a nice mattress for a guest bed. It is comfortable. It also was delivered very fast. I wasn't expecting it for a few more days.The mattress was for a guest bedroom. Initially I loved it. It was used about a week out of the month. It never expanded to 8\". It was initially very comfortable, but thin and very springy. Overall, it held up well. This time I am going to invest in a quality mattress. I do recommend this mattress for a guest bedroom that is not used often. It is far from the worst.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the Linenspa 8 Inch Memory Foam and Spring Hybrid Mattress for my toddler's bed, and I have to say, I am extremely pleased with my choice. As a parent, finding the right mattress for my child's comfort and support is of utmost importance, and this mattress has truly delivered.First and foremost, I was impressed with the quality and durability of the mattress. It is well-made and designed to withstand the wear and tear that comes with a child's bed. The hybrid construction, combining memory foam and springs, provides an ideal balance of comfort and support for my little one.The 8-inch thickness is perfect for a toddler bed. It offers a comfortable and plush surface without sacrificing the necessary support for growing bodies. It provides just the right amount of firmness to promote healthy spinal alignment and ensure a restful sleep for my child.One of the features I appreciate the most is the mattress's ability to isolate motion. This is particularly important when your child is transitioning from a crib to a toddler bed. It minimizes any disruptions caused by their movements, allowing for a more peaceful and uninterrupted sleep for both my child and me.Additionally, the mattress is hypoallergenic and made with safe materials, which gives me peace of mind. It is CertiPUR-US certified, ensuring that it is free from harmful chemicals and substances. This is especially important for children with sensitivities or allergies.Overall, I highly recommend the Linenspa 8 Inch Memory Foam and Spring Hybrid Mattress for toddler beds. Its quality, comfort, and safety features make it an excellent choice for providing a comfortable and restful sleep environment for your little one",

                "reviewText": "As other reviews have said, this is a surprisingly good quality mattress. Can't beat the simplicity of ordering on Amazon and getting it in a day or two in a easy to move box. Setup was easy enough and the smell was not bad at all and didn't last very long.Mattress looks good and is fairly comfortable. I prefer firmer mattresses and this is certainly on the softer side but it still provided a good night's sleep. It does feel a bit cheaper because it is lighter weight and a bit more giving and soft. For the price it is more than adequate but don't expect a high end feel with this mattress. I wouldn't recommend it for two heavier adults as a daily long term bed, as it seems like it might settle or sink more than higher end mattresses - but maybe it won't.We have been using this mattress for several months now and it is holding up really well.For a guest bedroom or for smaller individuals this is a great mattress for the price. Will it last for another 10 years, time will tell but even if not the convenience, price and comfort make it a winner so far.",

                "reviewText": "La verdad, buscar un colch\u00f3n nuevo nunca me ha gustado. Es mucho de ir a tiendas f\u00edsicas y lidiar con vendedores que pueden llegar a ser molestos ya que siempre quieren vender lo m\u00e1s caro, y la. Verdad, sus colchones del rango de 4000-6000 dejan mucho que desear luego.Decid\u00ed intentar algo nuevo y comprar un colch\u00f3n de los que vienen enrollados y enviados en cajas para variar.La verdad es que hace a\u00f1os que he querido comprar uno como los Luuna o otras marcas que ya tienen presencia en M\u00e9xico, pero sus colchones individuales est\u00e1n en 7000 o m\u00e1s y uno Queen ni se diga.Ya usando Amazon por un par de a\u00f1os, busque colchones de memory foam y encontr\u00e9 esta marca de LinenSpa la cual nunca hab\u00eda escuchado, pero despu\u00e9s de investigar en l\u00ednea y ver varias rese\u00f1as tanto en v\u00eddeos como escritos, decid\u00ed comprarlo.Este es un colch\u00f3n h\u00edbrido de memory foam y resortes cl\u00e1sicos y aunque si tuve dudas, estas desaparecieron despu\u00e9s de haberlo usado.El colch\u00f3n llega enrollado y en una caja, y es cuesti\u00f3n de solo sacarlo y acomodar lo de tal manera que cuando se desenrolle quede como se deba.Debo de advertirles que tengan sumo cuidado cuando vayan a romper la cinta con la cual esta asegurado el colch\u00f3n antes de desenrollarlo. Yo estaba cortando la cinta con un cuchillo, pero el colch\u00f3n, al tener resortes, lleg\u00f3 un punto que la cinta que estaba cortando no aguanto tanta presi\u00f3n de los resortes y revent\u00f3 lo que faltaba y el colch\u00f3n impacto contra mi mano que ten\u00eda el cuchillo a gran velocidad y por suerte no pas\u00f3 nada, pero algo pude haber salido mal as\u00ed que les imploro que no usen cuchillos y traten de quitar la cinta a mano (o a lo mucho con unas llaves o algo sin filo extremo).Una vez desenrollado y y haberlo dejado por m\u00e1s de 10 horas, el colch\u00f3n estaba en su apogeo y estaba listo para usarse.Ahora, nunca he usado un colch\u00f3n de puro memory foam, pero d\u00e9jenme decirles que este h\u00edbrido se siente incre\u00edble, ya que los resortes ofrecen excelente soporte pero el memory foam ayuda a que no se llegue a sentir ni un solo resorte en el cuerpo y solo se sienta un superficie suave y fresca.Por el precio, esto es un Super colch\u00f3n y vale la pena la inversi\u00f3n aunque seas un estudiante y apenas vas a comprar tu primer colch\u00f3n.",

Lo compr\u00e9 hace ya m\u00e1s de dos meses, por lo que esper\u00e9 para escribir esta rese\u00f1a cuando realmente pudiese opinar sobre el producto. Primero que nada, \u00a1viene en una caja! Es super f\u00e1cil de transportar, yo lo sub\u00ed sola dos pisos por escaleras sin problemas, mido 1.60, mujer, 32 a\u00f1os y soy de contextura normal tendiendo a rellenita.\u00a1Es muy divertido abrirlo y ver c\u00f3mo va tomando forma! Es firme, sin ser una piedra, pero lo que m\u00e1s me gusta es que mantiene su forma. Constantemente me siento sobre una esquina del colch\u00f3n para ver la televisi\u00f3n y me preocupaba mucho que se deformara, pero se mantiene intacto hasta ahora.Siempre he sido de dormir boca abajo, pero con este colch\u00f3n, por alguna raz\u00f3n, se me antoja y se me hace comod\u00edsimo dormir boca arriba o de lado y me despierto super relajada al despertar. Lo compr\u00e9 porque estaba durmiendo en una especie de sof\u00e1 que francamente me estaba destruyendo la espalda y ten\u00eda un dolor espantoso en la espalda baja y no me sent\u00eda descansada para nada.Llevo dos meses durmiendo en este colch\u00f3n y no solo ya no me duele la espalda, sino que me despierto descansada y con energ\u00eda. Le\u00ed no s\u00e9 cuantas rese\u00f1as de colchones tanto en ingl\u00e9s como en espa\u00f1ol y de verdad que no crean las que son negativas. Este es el mejor colch\u00f3n en caja ( y el de mejor precio ) que pueden conseguir.Me arrepiento de no haber comprado el tama\u00f1o Queen. Mi perrita, que tiene su propia cama, \u00a1ya no quiere dormir m\u00e1s en su cama sino conmigo y ahora se viene al colch\u00f3n a dormir la siesta! Estoy ahorrando para comprarme las almohadas de esta misma marca y m\u00e1s adelante este mismo colch\u00f3n pero en tama\u00f1o Queen y el topper.Pienso que si no te gustan los colchones firmes, puede que este no sea el colch\u00f3n para ti. Quiz\u00e1s una persona con considerable sobrepeso pueda llegar a sentir los resortes, pero como puse al principio yo soy de contextura normal, m\u00e1s bien rellena y no peso poco (\u00a1jam\u00e1s dir\u00e9 cu\u00e1nto peso!) y yo no siento absolutamente nada m\u00e1s que extrema comodidad.Hab\u00eda le\u00eddo tambi\u00e9n que muchas personas lo estaban comprando para ni\u00f1os, por lo que me preocupaba que no fuese a ser ideal para una persona adulta, pero nada que ver.Estoy encantada y se lo recomendar\u00e9 a todo el mundo.",
