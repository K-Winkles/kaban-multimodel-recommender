The one I got today was very quality, very comfortable once it fully inflated, does not have a smell, and is good for tall people and broad shoulder people. the pieces all zip together/come apart and makes for easier storage. I am leaving a review because it has been impossible to find consistent reviews everywhere, and others' reviews of this product helped me make the choice after weeks of researching. i looked at w@l m@rt and other sporting goods stores and this, for me, is the winner. it can fit in the car too for longer drives or camping.",

This is a great car mattress for trips and camping and was my savior for those nightly parking lot naps. I stayed at my moms for a week and I opted to use this mattress over her guest bed which dipped in the middle and felt like a torture device. She should buy one of these too come to think of it.I now use it on my patio as a seat. The removable cover is easy to clean and I was surprised at how it didn\u2019t look or feel any different after the wash. I used to have two of these from some other company that I used to rave about but this one is far superior. It\u2019s softer material, has handles and a carrying case, and is twice as comfortable.",

I took a bungie cord, wrapped around the cushions to carry it around. All the cushions have additional zippers so the covers can be washed. It was extremely comfortable for me; I have arthritis in my left hip and a hip replacement in the right hip as well as a spinal fusion and radiculopathy. No pain! I just wish it had a bag.",

I like that they're 3 separate pieces so one can just move them and they're not really heavy separately either. The fitted sheets hold all pieces together really well, no issue of separation. I do think that the cover should've been included but whatever I guess \ud83d\ude02.",
