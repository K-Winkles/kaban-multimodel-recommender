                "reviewText": "I caught this on sale for my oldest son\u2019s impending launch, with the expectation we\u2019d store it in his closet until he was ready to move (a few months from now- he\u2019s in his last semester of his college program). He has a smaller closet, and the way it\u2019s packaged makes it totally feasible to stand in a back corner until you\u2019re ready to open it. As it turns out, he was excited and ready to open it now. Oof.Fast forward 10 days, after I\u2019ve ordered the up-sized bed frame and mattress protector (I\u2019d already bought the sheets, pillows, and comforter set) and arranged to borrow the neighbor\u2019s guest bedroom so the mattress had a flat place to lay undisturbed for three days, and now he\u2019s lodged a complaint that this new bed is too comfortable and he\u2019s struggling to make himself get out of it for his 9 a.m. class.Our experience was kind of an obstacle course, but here\u2019s what you need to know:\u2022 The package is heavier than it looks. Proceed accordingly.\u2022 Don\u2019t open the plastic vacuum wrap until you\u2019ve got a flat surface this can lay on for a few days to fully re-inflate.\u2022 We didn\u2019t notice any strong odors after opening.\u2022 It expands rapidly when you open the plastic. Like\u2026 RoadRunner cartoon rapidly. Proceed accordingly.\u2022 Standard full-size sheets and mattress protectors accommodate it just fine.\u2022 It\u2019s more plush than we expected, but still has minimal motion transfer.\u2022 It really does stay cool. My kid sleeps hot and even after sleeping on it for 8 hours, he\u2019s still comfortable when he wakes up.\u2022 We have it on a bed frame with closely-spaced metal slats and no box spring, and it\u2019s still fully supportive. I\u2019ll add a board to extend the life of the mattress, but it\u2019s comfortable without either.\u2022 I had also planned to add a 3\u201d mattress topper to this when I bought it, to further extend the life of the mattress. I\u2019m still going to do that, but for comfort and cooling, it\u2019s not necessary.\u2022 It\u2019s too soft for me, but I have a long-standing angry hip flexor condition that demands a bed only slightly softer than a sheet of plywood.Overall, we are super impressed with this mattress; both at the sale price AND the regular price and we recommend it. It\u2019s a fantastic value.",

                "reviewText": "This Nap Queen mattress easily shaped itself in a couple of days, and there was no odor of any kind. The corners filled in nicely also. I highly recommend a foam mattress such as this one which has the specially designed heavy foam coils at the bottom. These make such a big difference in balance and support, and I am guessing the mattress will keep its shape much longer than those built out of layered sheets of foam.I have a tricky antique bed which has carved side and end boards, and it has been difficult to accommodate, as it is neither a queen nor full in size. The air mattress I was using died of old age; this Nap Queen full mattress tucked right into the padded and zippered mattress cover which had held the air units. Perfect, and much more comfortable!",

                "reviewText": "When this thing arrived it sprang open immediately, but even with giving it multiple days to expand it never reached the size of a regular full mattress. It also was much softer than I expected. Meaning, I can feel the individual springs move when I do on the bed. They're not hard or pokey, they are just the first resistance felt to me sagging deeper and deeper into the mattress. The top is nice and soft, a little too soft allowing you to feel the inards. But overall it's a decent mattress for the price. Not noisy, or lumpy, or uneven. A good starter mattress, and an overall good deal.",

We don\u2019t use a box spring so we had to go get some 2x4s to put underneath the mattress on the frame so the mattress wasn\u2019t sinking through the bars",

                "reviewText": "We were nervous at first when taking this out of the box and opening up the seal. It did immediately start to expand but the ends didn't. It was like there was no foam on the 11\" of each end. We ended up taking it outside into the sunshine to help it expand, since it says heat helps. This did the trick. We let our 10 year old sleep on it after 24 hours and she absolutely loves it. Her old mattress was awful and she's only 60 pounds, but it does seem comfortable. It did have some stuff on it which I lint rolled off. I can't tell what it is, but can see how some people said bug legs. I don't think it's that. Also, a few of the threads that give it the quilted top were loose. One corner didn't expand to 100% yet, so I'll report back on that and how it holds up later. So far, happy with the purchase.*update : it's been a couple months and she loves this mattress. It's the most comfortable one in the house, nice and soft. I took long nap on it one day and wish I hadn't gotten myself a different $1200 mattress, this is better.",
