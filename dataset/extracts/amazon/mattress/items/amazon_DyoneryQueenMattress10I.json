I have a history of back surgery and usually have pillows strategically placed but after having this mattress, I really don\u2019t need to do that anymore. The mattress does everything for me and I can sneak out of bed without waking up the cat or dog because nothing moves! It\u2019s just soft and melts into the perfect shape. No bouncing! Love it! Plus it was very well priced and easy to unbox! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I have 3 different brands of Amazon \"bed in a box\" mattresses. They are all the same memory foam styles. I have also owned many types of mattresses from a sleep number to tempurpedic and everything in between to alleviate back pain from military service.This is by far the best mattress I've ever purchased.It was purchased as a cheap option to needing a guest bed but turned out to be my bed of choice. My only regret is that I didn't get a king size to use in my room.You are able to sleep on your side, back or stomach comfortably. Normally, I toss and turn all night but I don't with this one.If you happen to turn them there is a less than ideal depression. It takes less than a minute to resolve but it is more noticable than my other two mattresses or a traditional inner spring mattress.There was no smell from the mattress as there had been with my other one and it inflated rather quickly.The mattress is soft yet progressively firm to support you.Movement from others is hardly noticeable.It's true to size and fairly lightweight.It appears to have a washable outer cover.",

I followed the instructions to open on porch or garage and let air out for an hour(I layed it out on a king comforter so it wouldn't get dirty. Takes two people to get in so you dont drag it or bump it) which I'm glad I did. Brought in and hour and a half later. No smell. Took about 4 days to reach full size. Maybe longer.
