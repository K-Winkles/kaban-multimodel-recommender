It'd be essentially laying on the hard floor with a thin layer of comfort, but THIS tri-fold is definitely not that. It's so thick and soft. It provides comfort in a portable fashion without being an air mattress. When I don't need it fully folded out I can use it as another seating option. The anti-slip texture on the bottom helps keep it in place no matter which way I am using it that day. The price might seem a bit high, but for this quality, it's worth it!",

                "reviewText": "This memory foam topper has many uses! It's VERY nice quality and VERY good value for money. It comes vacuum packed. and as soon as you open the bag it expands very quickly. It is true to size and thickness and as you can see my puppy took an instant liking to it. Each section has a zip so you can remove the pads for washing. The bottom has an anti-slip surface which will work well on my granite and wooden floors. It is super soft, and it is so comfortable and when you lie on it you can feel that it is very supportive. I love the way its tri fold so storing it will be so easy. The cost is what I would expect to pay for this, it's great value and I would recommend this topper.",
