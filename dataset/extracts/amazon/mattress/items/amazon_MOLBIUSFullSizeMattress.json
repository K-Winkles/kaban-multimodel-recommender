The foam top doesn't feel like memory foam at all - more like the cheap variety of plain foam.It's still comfortable, and is probably good for guest rooms or if you're on a budget. It's just not the level of comfortable I was expecting. I personally will be getting a mattress topper so I can match that softness I was hoping for.",
