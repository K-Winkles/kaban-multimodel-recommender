Knowing warmth is important for the mattress to expand quickly, I placed a heater in the room (I\u2019m in Canada and it\u2019s Septembrrrr) the day before it arrived so the room would be toasty warm.As a result, the mattress began expanding the moment I cut the plastic \u2013 and within 3 hours had reached 95% and within 24 hours was the full 10 inches. The middle inflated faster than the ends, but the ends are compacted much more than the middle \u2013 so it made sense. The mattress has no defects \u2013 including order. It was packaged very well and had silica packs to absorb moisture.Softness: On a scale of 1 (Firmest) to 10 (Softest) I would rate the mattress a 6.5 \u2013 and so comfy!",
