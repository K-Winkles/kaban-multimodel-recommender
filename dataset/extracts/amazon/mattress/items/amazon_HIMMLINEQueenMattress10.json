It was easy to set up. Expanded quickly and since we don\u2019t have another bed we slept on it that night. I usually wake up several times a night I guess because I was uncomfortable but now I sleep straight through. I\u2019m not going to say I wake up pain free, but I have a lot less aches and pains. It\u2019s just the right amount of softness and firmness for me and my husband. He\u2019s a back sleeper and I\u2019m a side sleeper. As far as sitting on the edge of bed, I can see where that might be an issue if you\u2019re used to doing that but I don\u2019t usually do that so it hasn\u2019t been an issue. It is without a doubt the most comfortable bed I\u2019ve ever slept on and my husband has praised my research efforts after selecting this bed. I realize everyone is different and this mattress might not work for everyone, but I couldn\u2019t be happier with my choice.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We are amazed with the quality of the mattress. To begin with, I find it incredible that it comes vacuum sealed and that when you open it you can immediately see that the mattress takes its shape, the instructions indicate that you have to wait 72 hours for it to take its shape, and so we did. After a few days of using the mattress, we were simply fascinated by its quality, it is soft but firm. It helps with posture and favors the back, avoiding pain the next day. It is a high mattress and has handles to hold it when moving it from the bed, which makes it easier to transport. We recommend it 100%.",

                "reviewText": "After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this item. I really wanted something that was supportive and comfortable. This bed does offer some support and comfort, but overall still does sink when laid on. I am a side sleeper, and I can\u2019t stand feeling like I am sinking into a hole. You can also really feel the springs when it sinks. I did like the outer rim, it definitely keeps the bed sheet on securely. But overall, my main focus was getting a bed that had enough support to NOT sink. And this was not it for me.I will update in a few weeks, and see if maybe ive changed my thoughts on this!Update : after a month of having this item, the bed now feels better. But it still is on the FIRM FIRM side. I added a topper on the bed for some cushion and it definitely helped!! Would recommend just be aware this is a FIRM bed.The seller also reached out and provided awesome customer service after seeing my review. Would definitely recommend trying it out!",
