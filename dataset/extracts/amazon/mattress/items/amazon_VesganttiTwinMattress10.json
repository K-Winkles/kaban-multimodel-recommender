I opened it and let it completely decompress over about 4 days. I recommend the same. It allows the hybrid coils to fully expand.This is one of the most comfortable mattresses I\u2019ve ever purchased and at this price point it\u2019s quite impressive. Now\u2026it is on a wood slatted platform with a brand new box spring. Together they are doing a great job. I\u2019ve only had it about a month so let\u2019s see how long it stays solid and in full support (without the over time sagging etc)!",

                "reviewText": "We wanted to put an XL Twin in the 3rd bedroom that's also used as an office. Looking around at brick/mortar stores the prices were crazy! Rickety frames were over $100 and mattresses started at $260. I decided to look at Amazon and boy was there a difference! I bought a good quality steel frame with slats (so wouldn't need box spring) for $50 that's rated at 2500 lbs! This mattress, with sale, was $180. We were VERY leery of buying a \"bed in a box\" mattress but it's really nice! Firm with a subtle thin pillow top that makes it very comfortable overall. Considering everything these days is made to be disposable, mattresses don't last past a few years anyway. We would much rather buy at these prices than pay double for same quality!",

What a rip-off. Going to see if someone locally wants it for a spare room where it won't cause chronic back pain, and I'mjust going to buy a better mattress and eat the cost.DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.---It's my first night with the mattress, and I can already tell that it is not what the pictures would lead you to believe. I don't know where all these supposed layers of foam and padding are - I can feel the springs on the side of the mattress and they go all the way up to the quilted layer. Sitting on it I can feel individual springs in some spots. Sitting on the edge I can feel the springs on the sides bending outward instead of straight down - there does not seem to be any real structure to keep the springs under control. Even my full memory foam mattress didn't sink this much on the edges.Will update after a few nights sleeping on it, but so far I am not impressed.I'll give it a couple nights to see if the sleeping experience is any better",
