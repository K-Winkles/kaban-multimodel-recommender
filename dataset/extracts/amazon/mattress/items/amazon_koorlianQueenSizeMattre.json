                "reviewText": "I bought a 14 inch box mattress that i hated because when i woke up i had sunk to the center of the bed. It was literally like sleeping on an air mattress. So i decided to try a 12 inch mattress instead and one with Firm Foam incorporated. I am so glad i found this one. While it seemed a bit firm the first month of sleeping on it it has softened a bit and it the perfect firmness. I suffer from really bad lower back pain because i have been a stomach sleeper my entire life and needed a mattress firm enough it wouldn\u2019t cause my lower back to arch more and one i could also sleep on the side and it wouldn\u2019t be like sleeping on concrete it would still mold to my body a little. I\u2019m glad to say this mattress as helped my back pain immensely and i wake up genuinely refreshed and well rested. It has great quality and was a great buy for the price. I don\u2019t think it had cooling gel in it but somehow is still able to be extremely breathable underneath me when i sleep. i\u2019ve had previous problems with foam mattress keeping me too hot at night and this one does not do that. Love the warranty as well and the 120 night trial since i was a bit skeptical about this mattress but ended up loving it. I was also able to set it up completely alone in my apartment i love that i came all boxed up.",

                "reviewText": "Summary: Mattress was 74 x 76, smaller than advertisedMy husband and I moved into a house with an extra bedroom. We decided to upgrade our Queen set to a King set and move our old bed suite to have a guest bedroom. Well, the holidays came around and I wanted to host my family, so we bought the mattress and moved our old set even though we had not picked out a new bed frame yet. We ended up just having the mattress on the floor for a few months because we are picky and didn't really like the bed frames that are commonly available. Even being on the floor, it is very comfortable and works for both me and my husband (so far) he tends to need a firmer bed than I do, but we are both enjoying this mattress so far.After using the mattress for several months and enjoying it, we finally found the bedroom suite we wanted! A local guy fabricated solid wood furniture for us that was beyond our expectations compared to everything we saw from the major furniture dealers. then we got it home and put the mattress on it. The mattress was SMALLER than the frame. There was a HUGE gap between the mattress and the foot board. I tried spinning the mattress, because maybe I accidentally put it sideways. NOPE. That made it worse.I measured the frame and the mattress and then measured them again because I was surprised by what I saw. My frame was perfect. 76 in wide by 80 in long. The mattress was 74in by 76 in.... and the was being generous since the corners of a mattress aren't sharp to easily get an exact measurement. To put it in perspective, my toddler had room to walk around and play between the mattress and the foot board.I scooted the mattress down to split the gap between the head board and the foot board. I had to stuff extra pillows between the mattress and the head board so that my pillow doesn't fall out from under me in my sleep. The gap at the foot board is less noticeable, but still scary because my toddler could easily slip between them and get hurt or stuck.",
