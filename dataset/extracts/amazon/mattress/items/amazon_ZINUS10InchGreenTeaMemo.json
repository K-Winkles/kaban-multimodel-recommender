                "reviewText": "EDIT: 3 month update.....I'm still leaving it at 5 stars. We have now had this mattress for just over 3 months and still love it. I am falling asleep faster, staying asleep and waking up feeling more rested. I have slept on both sides and even in the middle of the mattress and have equal comfort anywhere. I normally have 3 dogs hogging the bed and what's really nice is I barely notice if they get up and move to a new spot, even if it's right next to me. I no longer feel like my husband is doing backflips if he turns over in the middle of the night either. Even the one night the mattress pad didn't make it into the dryer in time for bed I did notice the difference the mattress pad makes in not making this mattress feel as firm, but it was still quite comfortable, just not as comfortable. I have no complaints. There were no smells with ours to start with so that never was a problem and it's still at a full 12\" evenly across.I'm in the camp of those who were really skeptical of buying a mattress online. Especially a foam one since I've had a regular pillow top one for the past 10 years. Yes it was time for a new mattress! I had been shopping around for a new mattress for a few months trying out different ones, getting pricing and trying to make a decision which is kind of a big deal when you're more than likely looking at spending a lot of money. A friend suggested we consider the foam mattresses and that Amazon had some good prices on them. I headed to a local store to give their version of these mattresses a try and I was surprised how comfortable they were. After testing them out I decided to see what Amazon reviews had to say about the ones they offered. I read through the good and the not so good and the flat out bad reviews and decided to take a chance and see what arrived. I am super happy I did! Granted it's only been 2 weeks but so far we love this mattress! I had read the multiple reviews saying theirs didn't inflate correctly, had a foul odor, was lumpy, etc....thankfully none of that was true of what we received.To break it down.....cons...It is a firm mattress no doubt. I am someone who likes to pretty much sleep in a cloud and am a side sleeper so it's taken some getting used to. Since the cost of this mattress was so good I went ahead and ordered a high quality mattress cover/pad and for me it's really helped make adjusting going from a plush pillow top to a firm bed a lot easier.Going from a spring mattress to a foam ones takes some adjustment on the support on the sides. Obviously the spring ones tend to have more of a frame around the edges so sitting on the side of the bed is different. I wouldn't say it's bad but it's not as supportive.We will probably need to get a new bed frame here sometime soon. While the box springs we had from our old king are still in great shape the lighter weight mattress tends to slide and needs to be shoved back into place every night before going to bed. Not really any fault of the mattress it's just a con that I'll need to replace the bed itself in order to stop this from happening.Another con that's not the fault of the mattress it's just my bad luck....I missed where this was on sale just after Thanksgiving because I was still pondering what kind of mattress to get. So I paid the higher, yet still on sale, price. 4 days later it went back on sale again and has remained $40 cheaper for over a week now. Bummer for me, but still a good deal, just not as good of a deal as if I'd waited 4 more days to decide.On to the good stuffPros.....Per my experience I say buy this mattress. Don't wait, grab it at the price it is now. I did not notice any sort of foul odor but I did open the windows and had the ceiling fan going while it inflated.It inflated to the full 12\" and did so within an hour. We were sleeping on the mattress withing 4 hours of setting it up. It fit where our old king size was perfectly with no overhang or shortages size wise. It's around 2\" taller than our old mattress so that took a little getting used to but it measured 12\" with a regular school ruler.It was well packaged and fully deflated ready to go when it arrived.I'm a big girl and my husband is a fairly big guy and we both sleep comfortably on this mattress with our 3 large breed bed hogging dogs. When my husband moves at night he does so like a fish out of water and I have noticed he doesn't wake me up turning over because it's not bouncing me around like our old mattress did. I don't even really notice a dog moving around to a different spot.I'm a side sleeper who would love to sleep in a cloud so this did take some getting used to but it's never been uncomfortable. The first night getting to sleep and finding a comfortable position took a little bit but I could instantly feel I was better supported and my hip and shoulder didn't have the pressure it normally would. When I turned onto my back I felt almost like I was sleeping in a hammock. Not totally of course but the extra support was there where it hadn't been before. With what I saved on the mattress I went ahead and bought a nice mattress pad/cover to put on top to make it a little more soft. I had always been told you can make a firm mattress more soft but you can't make a soft mattress more firm so if it's too firm invest in a good pad and it can make a lot of difference if you prefer a softer bed.What I noticed right away is when I woke up I wasn't as sore. I feel a lot more rested in the morning and I'm not waking up to turn over or move around near as much as I was. Granted our old mattress was 10 years old and that had a lot to do with it, but still this mattress is obviously better and keeps me in a deep sleep for longer periods throughout the night.My husband also says he's sleeping better and isn't flopping around like he had been doing with the old mattress. He's the one of us always complaining about being hot while sleeping and he said he hasn't noticed this mattress makes that any worse, and if anything since he's not moving around so much it's better.We like it so much we plan to order the 8\" version for our kid's bunk bed here soon.As we get more use of out this I will try to update this review for how it's holding up. I don't expect to get 10 years out of it, granted i probably shouldn't have tried to get 10 years out of the older one but it held up for at least 8-9 of those years. For this price I'd be happy if it lasts a couple of years. If it lasts longer even better. I highly suggest if this is too firm for you to buy a nice mattress pad and to buy it while it's at the price it is now.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that I haven't ever had the luxury of buying a new bed since I was born before this one right here, the 12\" Zinus Green Tea Mattress of the Queen sized variant. I had a spring bed with a pillow topper for 15 years. I was used to it, it did the job. I knew my bed was nothing special but I knew I could do better. When I finally ready to move out, I knew it was time to get a new bed. I'm fresh out of college so I knew I wouldn't be spending $800 on a mattress. And everyone says \"you spend half your life on a bed, make an investment!!\" Well that was true 10 years ago. Now, we can buy vacuum sealed beds on Amazon for 10th of the price of a Tempurpedic bed. There's so many these days, I needed to do my researchWhy Zinus?Through my deliberations on WHICH bed in a box I would purchase, it was between this, Casper, Purple and I think some other $500+ one. I wasn't considering the Amazonbasics one because it seemed very very generic and bare for my taste. Casper and Purple have great marketing and I see the ads all the time on the subway and on the internet. Reading some reviews, I saw that they might be a bit too firm. That lead me to Amazon where I found Zinus. The bset reviews say...well, its the best. The worst reviews are people who opened them up and got covered in fiberglass. Figuring that I wasn't going to open it up, I chose this one. It looks nice, the material of the case seems comfy and the alleged \"green tea\" will help me sleep better. Also, the bedframe I bought was also a Zinus so I figured that they would pair up better (spoiler: not really lol). Finally, it was only $279!!The first 2 daysThe box comes in the mail. It's pretty damn small for how big a queen mattress is. I'm not tall by anymeans and I was able to bear hug it up the stairs to my apartment. Out of the bag, I placed it on the bed frame. I let it breathe for a day with the windows in my bedroom cracked open before sleeping on it. (Yes, it smelled for the first day. The next day, a bit less. I believe within a week, there was NO smell left. I understood this would happen before I made my purchase and I will NOT be factoring it into the review because we're all adults and we will get over the smell without calling the bed trash.) 24hrs later, the bed had blossomed to around 12\" in most parts and 10\" around the corners. My girlfriend always says \"10\" is fine\" so I lay on the bed for the first time and woah... this is the comfiest bed I've ever layed on. My back didn't hurt, I was in bliss. The first sleep, I woke up so refreshed. I had NO complaints. Even my cat was on it all night and he usually gets up and goes on the move.Day 3 and beyond (6 months in total)Since day 2, not much has changed. The bed has retained it's shape. It wasn't broken in on 1 side and virgin on the other. The corners never really took shape but I'm not sure if this is due to the sheet I have over it. There is an element of body heat absorption which will have you wake up a bit sweaty. I recommend getting a lighter blanket or bamboo sheets to help with this. I did both and I don't sweat anymore. It's been 6 months of great sleep for me. Oh yeah, that green tea extract line is BS. I don't smell it, never did and I don't think it's what causes me to feel calm in bed. I think that the comfort is what makes me happyOverallOverall, this bed is absolutely worth it, every single penny. You can't beat the price for the quality of the product and the quality of your sleep. I love getting into bed and I HATE getting out because of how warm and comfy I am when I wake up. I 110% recommend this bed. Good luck!",

                "reviewText": "This is not the first foam mattress that I have had, but likely this will be the Only Brand I will purchase from now on.This mattress is such an excellent value, and as far as foam mattresses go, it is every bit as comfortable and has many more features than some that cost three or four times as much.The whole mattress is constructed of 4 layers of new, high density foam - 2 inches gel-infused memory foam to distribute body heat, - 3 inches of comfort foam, for even weight distribution, - 3.5 inches of \"breathable\" air-flow high-density foam to retain its shape, and 3.5 inches air-flow high-density base support foam to support your weight. The whole mattress is covered in a finely knit casing, that is soft and durable.And unlike any other mattress out there, the entire mattress is infused with a green tea and castor seed oil treatment to keep the mattress smelling fresh, and to defend against bacteria and skin mites or other organisms. (lovely thought, I know - but how long have you been sleeping on your current mattress?)The box containing the mattress was delivered to my door. It was securely wrapped, and the inside was triple wrapped and vacuum sealed. Instructions for unpacking the mattress were enclosed. After opening the mattress, you must unfold it ; then mattress immediately begins to \"inflate\".Within a few hours, it reaches its full mattress like shape. However, you Must let it lay flat for 48 to 72 hours before sleeping on it to allow the foam to breathe, finish totally reshaping, and to let any odors from packing and packaging to dissipate. Once you have done this, it is completely odorless, and your mattress is ready to be covered in sheets and used.The first night on my new mattress was amazing. I had a very deep sleep, and I don't recall tossing or turning. Most likely that is because unlike many spring mattresses, you don't have to lift yourself up to turn easily. You simply roll over, and the mattress conforms to your position and cradles you. Also, one thing I immediately noticed is the lack of pressure points on your elbows or knees when making the bed. Now that is a huge thing for me, as I had that issue for as long as I had my other mattress. By the second night in the bed, my back felt tired, but I had a good sleep. I put those aches down to my body realigning to a new mattress, and I haven't had any aches or pains since. It's been almost a two months now, and I feel I am sleeping better, am less congested, and feel better rested, so something is working right. At this point, I am extremely happy with my purchase and have no intention of going back to my old box spring set.Count me as very satisfied, and I Highly Recommend this purchase.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this with high hopes that it would decrease the pain in my back, if not completely eliminate it. I have fibromyalgia and epilepsy, which has done a LOT of damage to my back. In addition, I have lost nearly a hundred pounds and contrary to what every doctor I have seen in the past 15 years have said, the weight loss actually made the pain worse. I was at a point where I couldn't even get out of bed without narcotic pain medication, I would often wake up throughout the night with pain so bad that I couldn't breathe. My husband also has terrible back and joint problems that result in horrific pain, he too was unable to sleep through the night or wake up without excruciating pain. My husband was hesitant but the reviews were good and the price was low enough that he was comfortable taking the chance of buying a bed he had not tried out in a store. We've both been able to get out of bed every morning with little to no pain, we have been able to sleep through the night without being disturbed by the other person moving. We have been able to decrease our pain medication as well. I find myself waking up feeling rested and far more refreshed, I have energy throughout the day and don't crash mid afternoon. We have the mattress on an electric adjustable frame with the head raised a bit, it was recommended to use a 10\" mattress on an adjustable bed so that it bends properly but there isn't a problem with the 12\" as long as someone is on the bed when you adjust the frame, otherwise you get something similar to a fort. The description of the mattress says that it is cool because of special venting of some sort (I don't remember exactly what was written) but it is actually quite warm, we were waking up drenched in sweat. You can easily solve this problem with a pillow with a cooling pad in it, I bought two and we haven't had any issues since. The mattress does take a bit of time to \"break\" in but after a couple night it kind of hugs you. It also works quite well for sex, there are no springs poking you or making noise, no awkward angles from a squished or moved spring and no injuries from poorly timed bounces, I actually find it to be better with this mattress than with a conventional mattress to be completely honest, it hugs you and your partner which gives you a little more closeness and sensuality. When you move or get out of bed the mattress regains it's shape almost immediately, that makes it far easier to be comfortable right after you roll over. I've noticed a marked decrease in the instances of poor circulation from laying on my arm and my body always feels perfectly aligned. I wouldn't mind it being a bit softer and huggy but my husband likes a firm mattress and this mattress is the perfect firmness for him and doesn't force me to sleep in uncomfortable positions, feeling folded or on the couch in an attempt to sleep with as little pain as possible. I wish I had have invested in one of these far sooner! The only issue I had was that somewhere between placing my order and it being shipped, the entire address was deleted and all that was left was my name and the city name. It took some doing but I was able to track it down and pick it up myself. The box wasn't heavy but it was rather large and awkward. Within an hour of unwrapping it, the mattress was almost completely unsquished and we couldn't detect any smell coming off the mattress like other buyers have stated experiencing. I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase and will be purchasing more as I need them.",
