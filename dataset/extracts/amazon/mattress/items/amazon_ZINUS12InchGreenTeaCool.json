                "reviewText": "I just moved into an RV and was looking for a mattress for the platform in the bedroom but it\u2019s a special size so there weren\u2019t a ton of options so I very carefully read reviews, looked at stars of different things, and read the description. Despite slim pickings\u2019, I still needed a firmer mattress due to a severe back injury I\u2019ve had and in the very description it speaks of being pain relieving, to which I was a bit skeptical but everything else looked really good so I went ahead and took a chance on it. Boy am I glad I did! It only took about 2 days to decompress fully from the box. It\u2019s quite firm yet soft enough to sink in just a little, like the perfect amount. Now let me touch on this cooling effect and pain relieving factors. WOW! I mean WOW! I have been sleeping beautifully for days now, sleeping without waking up in the middle of the night due to back pain from laying down that long and I normally wake up for the day in a world of pain and have to take my pain meds before I can even sit up and stand up (successfully). I have not woken up with an ounce of pain, I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. This morning I didn\u2019t even have to start the schedule of my 4 times a day medication upon opening my eyes during normal life with my normal what I thought was a great bed, a Serta. The cooling feature is just as wonderful. It feels great, I haven\u2019t gotten the least bit warm as I usually do. So the description of the mattress is spot on, believe every word of it and what a bargain price for all of that!! When it comes time to replace it in my stationary, lived in full time RV, I will never get any other mattress. This mattress literally has everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a mattress and for such a great price at that. Needless to say, there are no cons whatsoever.",

                "reviewText": "Update: 3 years later, I still love this mattress. It\u2019s held up, is supportive and comfortable and never sleeps hot. It\u2019s been a very good buy for me. It\u2019s a very good inexpensive mattress that has proven to be a great value.I replaced a 20+ year old Sleep Number mattress with this mattress. I've had it over a week now and love it. The mattress is medium firm, which I like. The top layer of gel-infused foam provides a bit of sink in comfort, but not to the extent that it's hard to move or change positions. Mine expanded to a full 12\" within 2-3 hours of putting it on my bed (I kept the Sleep Number foundation on the bed under this mattress). I don't wake up with back or shoulder pain at all. My old Sleep Number mattress was giving me both. To give you an idea of the give in the top layer, I have attached a couple of pics of my dogs on the mattress. I will say, they LOVE the new mattress and I have a hard time getting my Pittie (Black & White pup) to get off of it. The Rottie/Shepherd weighs about 92 pounds and you can see, the mattress has a good amount of cushioning for joints and pressure points. It's been a GREAT buy!I will check back in 3 months and a year so I can say how the mattress holds up over time. Can't beat the price on this and I will be buying another one for my son soon.A month and a half later - STILL loving this mattress. It is still very comfortable. I sleep great. I don't think it sleeps hot. I don't wake up with back or shoulder pain. I bought a second one on Prime Day for my son. I don't think you can go wrong with this mattress.Four months later - this mattress is still great! My Pittie races me up the stairs to the bedroom and jumps in the bed first. When I'm at work, she sleeps on the bed. I love it. It's firm, yet comfy. I'm never hot and my room is the hottest room in the house during summer. I've recommended this mattress to all my friends and family. This has been an excellent value.14 months later - This mattress has held up well over time. It\u2019s still firm yet with enough cushion to be very comfortable. It has continued to be an excellent value for the money paid. No backaches or shoulder pain after sleeping on it. Both my son\u2019s and my mattress are in excellent condition. I continue to recommend this mattress.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Zinus 8 Inch Gel-Infused Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress / Cooling Gel Foam / Pressure Relieving / CertiPUR-US Certified / Bed-in-a-Box, Queen size. It has three different layers of foam and is not a hybrid model. First is the 4.5\" high-density base support foam, next is the 1.5\" comfort foam, and on top is the 2\" gel-infused memory foam. This is the first foam mattress I've ever owned, and I'll never go back to using the old box spring mattresses I've had all my life. The first night I slept on it with only a single sheet covering over the mattress and I was stunned by how nice and comfortable it feels compared to everything I've ever slept on before. The second day I installed the SafeRest Queen Size Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector, which is quite thin as it's a mattress protector and not a mattress \"pad.\" I noticed no difference in how it feels in any way with this addition after using the bed all day and sleeping for 8 hours the second night. I believe it's so comfortable because of how your body sinks down into the foam slightly which supports your mass more uniformly than other surfaces \u200bcan. Don't get me wrong about this, it's still a quite firm mattress so it's not like you sink way down into it. I wish there was some way I could better express just how much I love my new Zinus mattress!!! This is like sleeping on a cloud! I've read some negative reviews about people who've removed the cover that comes on the mattress to wash it or for whatever reason and then went nuts complaining about loose fiberglass fragments they encountered afterward. I believe the tiny amount of fiberglass material built into the cover is part of the fire-retardant material that makes up the cover. I also believe the warning the manufacturer gives about not removing the cover is their way of being over-cautious about the possibility of customers coming into contact with fiberglass fibers if they do so, and anyone who has removed the cover has NO ONE TO BLAME BUT THEMSELVES for any problems they encounter for failing to follow the manufacturers instructions. I haven't removed the cover on mine but I did open the zipper about 12\" so that I could stick my bare forearm inside and rub it around to see for myself if there really was loose fiberglass fiber but I didn't notice any indication of this at all. My recommendation if you ever feel the need to remove the cover to wash it or whatever is remove the cover, deflate the air out of it and then CLOSE the zipper (without turning it inside out) and then arrange it around the center post of your washing machine. This will ensure the inside and outside of the cover won't come into contact with each other. Wash on a delicate setting, no bleach, then after removing it from the washing machine don't put it in the dryer, just lay it out on the floor to dry before putting it back on. The first picture was taken just 5 minutes after removing the mattress from the box and it's a full 7\". 36 hours later it had expanded to the full 8\" as can be seen in the second picture. After about 36 hours it was fully expanded and was very smooth and flat with square edges, and it looks almost perfect in every way. I have no idea how long this mattress might last, but after paying only $200 plus $18 in sales tax with free shipping it's easy and cheap enough to replace. I'm still using my old bottom box frame but since the distance between the support slats is a full 6\" on my old base, I show in the third picture how I installed (with a few screws) some pieces of 1/4\" plywood to the top of it for better support for the foam mattress. I simply bought and installed 3 pieces of 1/4\" plywood at 24\" x 48\". I needed to cut the width of one piece for the foot end of the bed down 4\" so that the plywood would break over the supports slat of the old box base. If you choose to follow my example you may need to modify this to some extent depending on the spacing of the support slats of your base.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE this mattress. We were in the market for something cooling (both hot sleepers) and comfortable and this mattress has been a dream. It was fully raised with air after 24 hours and was instantly amazing to sleep on. It conforms comfortably to the contours of your body and bounces back up quickly. We've been sleeping on it for 3 months now and it's integrity hasn't been compromised whatsoever. A few things I looked for in the reviews at time of purchase were: does it smell when removed from the package? Do the corners puff out properly? How many inches are too much or too little?There was a mild odor when unboxing but it was not overwhelming and reminded me mostly of the plastic it'd been wrapped in than chemical odor from the manufacturer. The mattress conveniently arrived just as we were moving into a new house, so I was able to leave it alone in a bedroom with the window open for a full day before checking on it and the smell from it never raised any flags - I should note, I am also particularly scent-sensitive and was 5 months pregnant at the time so if it'd been overwhelming I would have avoided it.The corners puffed out just as they were meant to. One side raised quicker than the other and this worried me initially but eventually it was completely even. We decided to go for the 8\" as several reviews had indicated that there was no real need for anything more. This couldn't be more true. With baby, I'm about 220lbs, and the lowest my body sinks into the mattress may be 3-4 inches at the most. When I'm laid down, the weight is distributed more evenly and thus causes sinking to be even less, so during sleep there are still several spare inches between you and whatever platform or box spring you have below it. I can rest comfortably on my side or back with no issues and have found that being on my back is even more comfortable with this bed than others because the foam moulds so nicely around you.Something important to note, like any memory foam mattress, one should keep in mind that this is NOT a bed that you can jump into! It doesn't absorb shock AT all.For the price point, Amazon Prime delivery option and overall satisfaction, I would recommend this mattress to ANYONE in the market. An incredible value, especially with Endy/Casper and other competitors offering similar products at 5-10x the price.** to note as well, we also purchased the Zinus bed frame separately and were super impressed with it as well. Very simple and sleek design, extremely straight-forward building instructions and a great little multi-tool that came with. Plus, it came with some super handy little double-sides adhesive strips that cling the mattress to the steel frame to prevent it from slipping around! Amazing!**",

You can sleep in my position. My husband\u2019s arms used to go numb whilst sleeping on his side but not anymore. We can also comfortably sleep without pillows. Back pain has decreased a bit and definitely sleeping more solid. 10/10 would recommend to a friend",
