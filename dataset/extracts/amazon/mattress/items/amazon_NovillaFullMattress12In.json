                "reviewText": "Buying a mattress online is a nerve racking experience. I must of looked at 15 different mattresses before deciding to buy this Novilla. I ordered the mattress on the 3rd and UPS delivered it on the 5th. In the tracking info it said it weighed 88lbs, but this definitely felt like it was over 100lbs. I had a Serta mattress before this and this mattress felt much heavier!Novilla included a manual and a tool to open the vacuum sealed plastic without running the risk of cutting the mattress itself. As soon as the plastic was pierced it started to make a hissing noise. Once I cut it open all the way the mattress just popped completely open. It did open upside down though so just be mindful. Also, be careful because it can unfold quick.Once open it expanded to full size. The photo below of the mattress opened was taken 10 minutes after removing it from the plastic! My wife and I left it for 4 hours without laying on it, but I don\u2019t think it needed any more then 30 minutes!*As of right now, it\u2019s 9:10PM on the 7th so tonight will be the 3rd night we sleep on it. It\u2019s make no noise, it\u2019s more on the firm side for us, and it feel so much better then the Serta we had!! My wife is about 120lbs and I\u2019m around 195lbs. I know depending on your weight it might feel softer or firmer.I hope this review helps someone who is considering this mattress! If I didn\u2019t already know and had to guess the price, I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the range of $800-$1200. So if you\u2019re thinking about making the purchase and you like a slightly firmer mattress that\u2019s quiet and really comfortable, look no further!I\u2019ll be sure to update this review in the next 2-4 weeks to let y\u2019all know how it\u2019s going.**1 week update 08/12/23I know it\u2019s only been a week, so I don\u2019t have too much to say. It\u2019s holding up great and still feels the same as the day we received it. It has no noise issues, no sinking issues, it\u2019s still very comfortable! The only con I can say about it is it\u2019s just a tiny bit larger then a traditional queen mattress. Each side hangs off the frame by about 1 inch. That\u2019s just me nitpicking though because it\u2019s not a problem whatsoever. Anywho, I hope this review helps someone with their purchase, I\u2019ll check back in at the 1 month mark.***2 months & 2 weeks later! 10/19/232 months with the new mattress and it\u2019s still like brand new! No sinking or anything. I wouldn\u2019t guess this mattress was so cheap if I didn\u2019t already know. 3rd photo posted is from the 2 month mark.**it\u2019s now October 19th and still, the mattress feels brand new! I\u2019ve been rotating it every 2 weeks when the sheets get washed. It\u2019s more broken in now so it might of just gotten a tad softer, but not in a bad way. even a $3,000 mattress will break in after a bit of use. There\u2019s no sagging or anything! It still looks brand new when the the sheets and mattress protector are off of it. I recommend this bed to everyone! Someone on Reddit bought it with my recommendation and I heard from him twice now about how good it\u2019s been for him. So yeah, I\u2019ll continue to check back in, I\u2019m glad my review has helped so many people!!",

Unfortunately, money has been tight and looking for a mattress in a store around $1k was not an option.Found this little gem and decided to take a leap, and lo and behold! Easy to open (though i almost hit myself in the face from opening it upside down), grew to its expected size in about 2.5 days, and lost that weird \"new\" smell easily. Good support for our chronic aches, sturdy, and a good balance between firm and soft for us!Like some other reviewers have said, the edge support is a little weak, but nothing thats a deal breaker. No squeaking or noise when we get in and out of bed.To some, its probably not terribly groundbreaking, but for us, its just right!",

What made me get it was that it seemed to be of slightly better quality than the leading competitors. I can agree it definitely does sleep cooler. My son has stopped complaining about it being too hot in the bed. As for the comfort of the bed, my son does feel like rest better than on his previous mattress. The mattress for my 6 year old som and I have to say I was not expecting the quality and comfort that came for the price. The mattress is air sealed and rolled and once you open it it expands, which was fun for our toddler to watch. It has been hard getting our little one to sleep in her room, but a couple nights on this mattress and he loves sleeping in his room now. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "I had been wanting a new mattress for our pedastool bed, but mattresses can be very pricey. I studied them all and read hundreds of reviews. I was even considering one in this same brand when I came across this model. It's a hybrid. It has coils that are wrapped in the bottom, a large thick memory foam mattress in the middle and a jell layer on top that gives you a pillow top feel without being too soft. It's designed for side sleepers. It has a slightly raised lip on the sides of the bed to ensure you don't roll off. It's also made to adjust to your pressure points as you sleep. I'm disabled and spend a lot of time in bed. I love it. When I read that it has a 100 day sleep trial and a 10 year warranty I was sold. Great mattress at a great price. The delivery guy had a hard time getting the product onto my porch. My grand kids found the warranty out in the yard. I called customer service and they refunded me my first payment which was great on their part. Nothing but good things to say about this mattress and seller. Hope this helps. You can't go wrong with a 100 day free trial no questions asked. Very much worth the money for a great night's sleep. I can honestly say this was my best pick. I did My research and kept going back to this one. I'd buy it again and again. My husband even loves it.",
