They want you to take it out of the packaging immediately so it doesn't become deformed but it took shipping nearly a week. Seems to have fluffed up Farley nicely and is just the right amount of firm. I'm coming from a cheap hybrid mattress I bought new 3-4 years ago. Started developing terrible back pain, no matter what position It felt like my spine was being pulled in opposite directions. I wanted a cheap mattress that was firm and foam asap, this was the only one with next day delivery. Unfortunately \"as said in the title\" it arrived really late. But it is good enough that I can recommend. It's not as firm as I hoped, but it is much more firm than my old bed and is honestly pretty comfortable. The mattress shaped nicely after about 6 hrs. The corners took a little longer and aren't perfect but good enough for me. I will edit this review if I run into any problems down the road.",

I ordered a king size to fit the platform bed in photo. Also ordered from Amazon. The mattress is soft but firm as in you won\u2019t be disturbed if someone else gets in bed with you. Trust me I have toddler boys who sneak in bed, while I\u2019m asleep. I don\u2019t feel them moving all around. As you lay down it conforms to your body. But once you\u2019re out the bed. There are no indentations left behind. There was no smell, no tears or any defects that I know of.",

Once final bag was opened you have to move quickly to get it out before it opens up, a two person job. It's very comfortable sleeping on, just a good height with box spring. I would highly recommend this product if you need a new mattress. I got the twin size.",
