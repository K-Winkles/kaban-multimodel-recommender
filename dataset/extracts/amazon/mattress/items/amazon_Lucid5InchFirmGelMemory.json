                "reviewText": "I purchased this as my 2.5year olds first big boy bed. It\u2019s perfect! No bad smells, it fluffed up right away, and was easy to open.Mine fluffed up to size instantly. I was hesitant to buy this based on reviews but mine was perfect.No one has slept on it yet, so I can\u2019t speak for comfort... but I did lay down on it and it was very comfy. Is perfect size, stiffness, and comfort for a toddler. Would recommend and purchase again.It is thin, but it\u2019s the size it shows when purchasing. If you\u2019re in need of a thin but comfortable and reasonably priced bed... this is it.Not sure on what the mattress is made of, or if it is made of what the description says, but it\u2019s still a great mattress.UPDATE: 4/27/2021 - this mattress is amazing. Fits perfectly in the bed frame I had made for my son. He slept amazing on it last night! Absolutely love! See last 2 images!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great for my bad back",
                "reviewText": "Like many of my fellow bipedal hominids of a certain age, I've developed a degenerated lumbar disc and, being a side sleeper, have found I need a very firm mattress to keep my spine from bending and pinching through the night. I'm taking the time to write this up in hopes it's of use to others with bad backs struggling to find a good night sleep and eliminate the source of their pain.My lower back pain was getting progressively worse for several years until I realized the problem might be the \"firm\" $2K mattress I was sleeping on. I went camping for a week, sleeping on just a 2\" memory foam topper on the ground; pain started to subside immediately. I've since tried out a couple other \"firm\" mattresses in the $2-3K range and have come to the opinion that there's no such thing as a mattress that is both thick and also firm. The more material you add, the more sag you're going to get. Period. Companies would obviously rather sell you a thicker, more expensive mattress, but if you want a truly firm mattress it must be thin.This LUCID mattress is unusually firm; firmer than I had expected and firmer than I had even hoped for. It's definitely not as plush as thicker options. But it is GREAT for my back, and starting the day pain-free is the most important thing. It was a little too firm for my partner, so we added a 1\" latex topper which is nearly as supportive and quite a bit more comfortable. I would recommend this combo.The only setup I've found that is better for my back is the aforementioned firm 2\" memory foam mattress topper right on the floor. That's the setup I use for car camping and I never sleep better than on one of those. It's perfect in terms of both support and comfort, at least for me @ 5'8\", 150lb. The downside is I've found those toppers only last a couple years of daily use before softening to the point your hips start to feel the ground beneath. If you try the topper-only strategy, make sure it's high-density as they're not all the same. I got mine at Costco.The reason I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 is that they obnoxiously list it as 60x80\" (true queen) but both the box and tag list its true size, which is 59\"x79\". So the description is misleading (perhaps even deliberately so, as getting those numbers right would have been a trivial task). I'd rather pay 3% more for a mattress that fits both my bed frame and my sheets. 1\" matters when you're sharing a queen. I ended up returning the mattress for this reason alone despite it otherwise being a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "Got this during Prime Day to replace a couple of foam toppers I have been using on a hand-me-down traditional full mattress and box springs set that is still too hard for my taste despite being broken down. The two toppers were about 5 inches total of just \"memory foam\" and weren't really getting the job done. I am 62, overweight, and have arthritis in many joints, including my hips. I sleep mainly on my left side but at times, my left hip would hurt and I would end up on my back during the night. This caused my back to hurt and my legs to go numb. Not to mention apnea episodes with multiple wakings during the night.To be honest, I really didn't pay much attention to the inches and just saw the good price - got mine for a lot less than what it's going for now. When I got it and saw that it was only 5 inches, I worried. Especially when I read on the company website that it was designed to transition kids from the crib to a full size bed. I was afraid it wouldn't be firm enough to give the support I needed. Happy to say that assessment was very, very wrong.I got it out of the box at around 11:00 am and it was fully decompressed by the time I was ready for bed 12 hours later. There was no strong smell that I could detect and I am very sensitive to smells. It's firm enough to keep my hip from hitting bottom yet cushy enough to keep me pain free. I woke up on my side, exactly as I had gone to sleep. Basically, I slept like a rock and woke up feeling a lot better than I usually do.I would definitely recommend this mattress if you are looking for a replacement. However, considering how the full mattress is suddenly going for more than twice what I paid for mine during Prime Day, you might want to check around for a better price if you're looking for a full.By the way, this mattress works just fine atop a traditional mattress and box springs. I even have another foam topper between the older mattress and this new one but only because it would have been a royal pain to have gotten rid of the topper first.",

En este sentido, mis felicitaciones por la rapidez del env\u00edo.* El colch\u00f3n viene dentro de una caja de cart\u00f3n, envuelto en pl\u00e1stico, enrollado y sellado al vac\u00edo. Quitar la caja puede ser complicado si no tienes apoyo de otra persona y los pl\u00e1sticos deben quitarse con mucho cuidado con la navaja que viene incluida en la caja. Al momento de desembalar y desenrollar el colch\u00f3n, \u00e9ste viene muy delgado. D\u00e9jalo reposar unas horas (yo esper\u00e9 unas 10 horas aproximadamente) y se inflar\u00e1 solo, poco a poco.* El colch\u00f3n es comod\u00edsimo. Es de firmeza media, por lo que considero que es adecuado para todo tipo de personas. Yo puedo dormir boca arriba y de costado en \u00e9l sin ning\u00fan problema. Esto lo comento porque a\u00fan cuando Lucid lo vende recomendando su uso en ni\u00f1os, la verdad es que yo s\u00ed he dormido muy bien, con mis 25 a\u00f1os de edad.* El colch\u00f3n es de memory foam en su mayor\u00eda, as\u00ed que se hunde c\u00f3modamente donde te acuestas/sientas (si no te agrada la sensaci\u00f3n de hundimiento, el colch\u00f3n no es para ti), y cuando te levantas puedes ver como el colch\u00f3n recupera su forma, por lo que siempre se sentir\u00e1 como nuevo. Llevo 1 mes con el colch\u00f3n y sigo teniendo la misma experiencia c\u00f3moda (actualizar\u00e9 la rese\u00f1a cuando esto ya no sea as\u00ed).* El colch\u00f3n tiene 12.7 cent\u00edmetros (5 pulgadas) de alto para ser precisos (no 13 cent\u00edmetros, como dice la descripci\u00f3n del producto) y eso lo convierte en un colch\u00f3n liviano, facil de mover y cargar. Derivado de su altura y facilidad de movimiento, decid\u00ed ponerlo encima de mi antiguo colch\u00f3n sin ning\u00fan problema.* Alivi\u00f3 mi dolor de espalda pero de manera muy leve, por lo que si sufres de problemas serios o graves de cuello o espalda, este colch\u00f3n no es tu mejor opci\u00f3n. Mejor opta por un colch\u00f3n ortop\u00e9dico.En general, un buen colch\u00f3n: econ\u00f3mico y c\u00f3modo como cualquier otro colch\u00f3n de memory foam.",
