                "reviewText": "Took a chance buying a bed in a box. I spent a lot of time looking here and other places, reading reviews.The reality is that store brand mattresses just cost a fortune for anything remotely quality or comfortable, especialy king size. The mattress is heavy! Took two of us to get it in the house and unrolled. I let us expand for several days before sleeping on it. The corners took a little longer but we were using this bed within a couple of days. We have had it now for a couple of months and I feel like it's even more comfortable as it's broken in. It is more firm than I expected however we had prior been sleeping on a very worn well-known brand mattress that honestly was causing us so much back pain, hip pain and discomfort, I am relieved we gave this a try. We should have been sleeping on a more firm bed I have realized. My hips are no longer hurting. I have been waking up feeling rested for the first time in a long time! I love the memory foam plus individually wrapped coils. With two of us (and often two dogs) in the bed, the mattress is holding up well. We are both over 200# and have two large dogs. We might try adding a 1-2\" foam topper but honestly the mattress is really comfy as is. The edges are not as firm as store bought mattresses and you will sink down a bit if sitting on the edge of the bed but it's not been a problem. We don't feel as if we will roll off. There is also really NO problematic movement in the bed if one person rolls over or shifts, it does not disturb the other person! I don't know how well this bed will hold up over time but it has a 10 year warranty. It seems very well made, it is comfortable and I imagine we will get at least a few years out of it. So at this price, it is very well worth it. We are pleasantly surprised!",

But when you lay down on it, it's really comfortable and it conforms to your body weight. Too soft for me (and I like plush beds) but for great for a lighter weight individual. My son loves it and that's what matters the most. It inflated very quickly and didn't even need to wait 72 hours since it was fully decompressed within a couple of hours and my 5 year old only weight like 40lbs so I didn't it would affect it much anyways. So far so good, hopefully it holds up as I'm planning on this being my son's bed until he's at least in high school.",
