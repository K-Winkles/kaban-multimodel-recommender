                "reviewText": "Since I'm 6'1\" (~186cm) tall, I ordered a Full XL-sized bed frame. It was difficult to find a Full XL mattress that met my needs, so I settled on this Milliard Full size. It seems to be about 3\" longer than a standard Full size, which is actually perfect for my needs.For context, I was sleeping on a spring mattress before this. It was great, until the springs started stabbing out from the mattress' surface. I ended up using my Milliard futon sofa mattress on my bed frame while waiting to order something new, and found it was really comfortable! The futon version is 6\" thick, and I could feel the bed frame's bars through it just a little bit, but that's not a problem at all with the 10\" mattress shown on this store page.It's very firm, but not hard. I was able to sleep splendidly after just 8 hours of expansion time, but it may take up to 72 hours to reach its full potential. When I woke up in the morning, I noticed that the mattress corners had continued to rise and properly square-up as I slept.Age, work, and health factors have teamed up to trouble me with acute back pains. After one night sleeping on this wonderful mattress, I already feel a substantial decrease in such pains. I really hope this effect continues.Normally, when I get in bed, I spend a little time reflecting on the day and thinking about what I have to do the next day, but on this mattress I fell asleep before I could begin ruminating, and woke up feeling energetic and focused. What a treat it is to wake up feeling ready for work, instead of dreading getting up.A major, MAJOR feature I love about this mattress is not sinking into it. This means I can roll over easily and not overheat. I've had a lot of problems along those lines with previous memory foam mattresses, but not with this one!I'm also very pleased with the price. I spent a few days sleeping on a $1000+ Purple mattress with similar properties, which I feel are met or exceeded by this Milliard bed, which I spent $270 on. If Milliard can keep it's quality this high and prices this low, I'll become a lifelong customer. That may sound like I'm overstating things, but we need comfortable shoes, nutritious food, and good beds to do our best each day. Milliard has the bed part covered!To suit my personal sense of comfort, I augmented my mattress with two of the following Bamboo-brand toppers, to help further dissipate heat and to simulate the feel of a pillowtop-style mattress. I also layered three of these toppers on my Milliard futon sofa mattress to give it a super-plump & cozy feel. Your preferences may vary.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0831L9J53?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details",

I def recommend and we had a temperpedic before, albeit was a much older used one donated to us by my dad so it was due to be replaced even though orig it was extremely expensive and was labeled as firm it didn\u2019t last as long as expected. Bring it was a high end brand. So it really surprised me something less expensive would be this comfortable. I\u2019m super happy about our purchases and definitely highly recommended if you\u2019re in the market for a new mattress. A+",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this since the end of July, so it\u2019s been a couple months of continuous use. When I first got this, it was easy to \u201cinstall\u201d and boom, I have a new mattress. I loved it, it was firm and affordable!However, since I sleep in the middle of the bed, the middle has a dip that really makes it hard to sleep. I thought it would\u2019ve last longer than 3months based on the reviews and their advertisement but now I\u2019m dealing with a dipped bed.Given the Price , it wasn\u2019t too bad but I should\u2019ve known that it was \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d I guess. Sucks that it has a dip in it. And yes, I have slept on different areas of the bed to kinda reduce the dip but it didn\u2019t work. So now I\u2019m on the hunt for a new mattress.4 starts cuz of the price, and comfort. The durability could be better but I guess you get what you paid for.",

After nearly a year it still feels like brand new.I do use a mattress cover with a little padding that gives it a little give, which is perfect.A big plus for ne was absolutely no chemical smell after letting it air out for day outside.Highly recommend if you like a firm mattress",

I'm 5'8 200 lbs and didn't sink down like have in other memory foam mattresses but it still is soft enough to cradle. Only had it for a few nights but so far its been far better than I expected, as at home I sleep on a purple matress.",
