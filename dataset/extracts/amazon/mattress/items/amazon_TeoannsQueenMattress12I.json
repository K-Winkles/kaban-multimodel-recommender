The only downside its on the edges its too soft, feels like you are about to fall off. And you can feel your partner or yourself move when readjusting during your sleep.Now delivery was awesome! I live in an apartment complex, which they had no issue locating my apartment for delivery. As well delivery was fast.",

                "reviewText": "I made the mistake of cheaping out and buying the least expensive mattress I could find about a year ago, and have sorely regretted it. My back has hurt for months. My mom bought one of these and loved it so I gave it a try. It came in a surprisingly small (for a mattress) package and inside the mattress is folded up and vacuum sealed, and came with a small cutting device to open the plastic wrap. I didn\u2019t have any problems unwrapping it but just be really careful when using the device to cut the plastic wrap so you don\u2019t cut the mattress. Also be aware that when you cut the plastic wrap and air is sucked in it might spring out suddenly. I let the mattress rest for 72 hours so it could \u201cfluff up\u201d after being folded and vacuum sealed and then I slept on it. My back feels so much better and I\u2019ve been pretty consistently getting a good nights sleep. I\u2019m really pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this mattress because the ratings here on Amazon were great. Okay, so it's a bed in a box; I get that.... I purchased, followed the instructions, and the middle just didn't \"puff\" up like the rest of the bed. I figured that I would give it a week before I complained. I tried contacting Amazon for an \"exchange\"; certainly this mattress that I got was defective.... but I was told that I would need to return it and reorder. Okay. so I can do that (I guess?!!) So, here I am trying to prep this KING size mattress for UPS to pick up; but I couldn't get it thru the front door! Now what? I contacted Amazon again, and they want to \"schedule\" some people to come help... but no time was given. Another 2 weeks (I was told)... so here I am with a King size mattress that failed to expand in the middle, and I can't even get it out of my house to return. Maybe a dud? IDK, but I can't recommend. I'm so sorry that this happened!update 32 days later :i tried to have some more patience with allowing time for the mattress to expand; but in the interim i\u2019ve been struggling with a stiff neck, back, and headaches. I contacted amazon for \u201chelp\u201d and chatted with a customer service representative who extended a \u201ccourtesy \u201c refund, even though it was past the 30 day mark. This mattress came with an explicit 100 nite \u201csleep guarantee \u201c; so i\u2019m a bit confused why amazon thought that they were doing me a favor !! I immediately purchased a true \u201cfoam\u201d mattress; not this \u201chybrid mumbo jumbo that proved to be a waste of everyone\u2019s time (and money). I would suggest that Amazon do a better job vetting the products and manufacturers that they represent because I must truly say that this was a pain in my neck (no pun intended) to deal with and makes me think twice before making a major purchase on Amazon.",

It also fluffs up pretty quickly. Was able to use it the night I got it. Its soft, but firm. Feels great. All in all...I highly recommend!!!!",

I was hoping for much more relief. I waited 2days to sleep on it. It did fill out nicely so it looked very inviting. The side have very little strength. You\u2019ll need a bench at the end of the bed to sit on for putting on shoes, you could not sit on the side of the bed. It\u2019s a little hard to get on and off. So all in all for a mattress under 300 it\u2019s okay, I do wish I picked another one. It has great reviews overall, I my opinion it doesn\u2019t life up to them! I give 3 stars because it was shipped quickly and it opened and inflated nicely. It looks like a quality mattress.It is firmer than I expected. the sides don\u2019t support your weight, you basically slide off the bed? I still feel pressure points",

                "reviewText": "Like many others, I spent months researching mattresses. This is the first mattress in a box I have purchased and\u2026..I love it! I was sceptical to say the least after all how good can a mattress be, that comes out of a box? Well, let me tell you this Teoanns mattress is really amazing. It is very comfortable, rose up to its 12\u201d immediately. No issues taking it out of the packaging at all. Yes, it inflates super fast once you cut the plastic wrapping so be ready. Yes, it is quite heavy and is a two person job. I places the rolled mattress right on my slatted ikea bed frame, cut the outer plastic wrap, rolled the mattress out along the slats , cut the final layer of plastic wrap and watched it rise in less than 60 seconds. I pulled the plastic wrap from beneath the mattress and voila, it is laying in place on the bed frame. I will leave it for the required 72 hrs to give it the full resting time period before we use it. I couldn\u2019t resist laying on it and oh boy, it feels wonderful. I am definitely looking at purchasing another from Toeanns. I know how hard it is to purchase a mattress online that you have not seen/ felt for yourself first but believe me, you won\u2019t be disappointed. Given the price point, you are definitely getting value for your dollars.",
