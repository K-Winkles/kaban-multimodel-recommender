Would make an excellent mattress for anyone looking to replace a short queen mattress in an RV. Another great feature is it did not smell like many foam mattresses do when you first use them.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I have used this mattress daily and it's not comfortable anymore. It dips in the middle, it's uncomfortable after a while, and it's just not worth the money- look somewhere else. I'm only 24 and I'm waking up with back pain and uncomfortable body aches. I mentioned it to my partner and he said, \"Oh yeah, I thought it was just me. It's like you can't lay in the bed for too long.\" I hate how it feels. I don't look forward to going to bed anymore and will sometimes fall asleep on my couch before I will get in the bed. Don't get it.It took me a while to decide on getting this bed or not, due to the reviews. I ordered it anyways and I'm not disappointed. The box was delivered, and it was HEAVY! With the help of someone, we dragged the box into the house. After I struggled to get the box off of the mattress, it immediately started to hiss. With the cutter that comes with the mattress (Super helpful btw), I excitedly ripped off the plastic and initiated the inflation process. It quickly started to expand, and as it expanded, I put together a bed frame, then slapped the mattress on top to continue to inflate. I came back about ten hours later, exhausted, and put sheets on the bed, ready to lay down. It's not thee most comfortable thing in the world, but it's nice and soft. For the price, it's perfect. I don't feel the springs at all. Like other reviews, the edges are weak, so I always make sure to scoot back a little to avoid literally slipping off of the bed (My sheets are silky). It's not bad at all.",

                "reviewText": "After Carefully reading the Reviews I decided, take the leap of faith and get it. The upside to this Order was that Delivery was fast! It came a day before expected deliver date. We had no problem unrolling and waited for the mattress to fluff up as it should but the corners were so deformed while it was trying to go back into it shape. Waited and waited and nothing, Here I was left my phone on a phone stand to record the amazing transformation and I forgot to hit record. What a joke on my end. This mattress was advertised as Medium Soft, more like tooo soft. I am 5'2 at 120 lbs and my husband is 6'2 and 205 lbs and we both sat on it and sank straight in. Yep not the mattress we were expecting. I expected a slight firmness to it but overall it was the deformity of the corners that isn't sitting right with me, especially for the price. I decided to wrap this mattress into a new mattress plastic bag and requested a pick up for a Return/Refund.I just can't understand why 3 corners just didn't budge and looked droopy.I'm now on a search for another mattress that doesn't come in a box hopefully since all mattresses nowadays are delivered in a box.",

                "reviewText": "Mattress is for a guest room. It serves it purpose, but when one sits on it, be careful or you'll fall/ slide off. Once in the bed it is comfortable. Can hear the springs a little. If the lateral side were more supportive, it would be a great find. As it is is a good economy find. Not for everyday sleeping, unless money is tight and need something to tide you over to do better I placed a nice mattress pad on it also. I gave 1 star for pain relief because it didn't apply. mattress is very soft but took off for lack of side support",
