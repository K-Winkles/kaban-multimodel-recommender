                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been really surprised by how nice this mattress is for the price!It came well packaged and instantly started inflating right out of the plastic. I was a little worried at first because the top padding seemed very flat, but sure enough, it just kept expanding until it looked like the listing photo. The instructions say to sit for a few days, but I set it up around the 24 hr mark.It\u2019s been very comfortable so far. It\u2019s a medium firm softness, but the coils add a lot of support for back and side sleepers. I added a mattress topper and it\u2019s absolutely perfect. I was also worried about the sturdiness as a bigger guy, but it seems to be holding up well so far and it stays fairly cool all night.Really, you can\u2019t beat it for the price. It\u2019s been MUCH more comfortable than the $500 birch mattress I traded it out for. Great budget mattress, would highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "If you're new to vacuum-packed foam mattresses, here's what you need to know.-Yes, you really do need to let it sit for a minimum of 24 hours. 72 hours is better. I know it's hard. But it will make a difference not only in how supportive your new mattress is, but also in how long it will last you.-They start inflating really quick once you open the plastic wrap, so be prepared. You will not have time to go clear a flat surface before it starts to grow like one of those dinosaur capsule bath toys.-The boxes are heavier than they look. Don't be a hero, here. Lift with your legs, use a dolly, etc. Safety first.-Adding a flat and solid (not rails) supportive bottom like a box spring or bunkie board will significantly increase the life of these mattresses. It's not a requirement, but it will slow the breakdown that all mattresses go through.-Get a waterproof topper, encasement, protector, fitted sheet... whatever fits your budget. Worth it to extend the life of your mattress.-Sometimes they stink when you first open the packaging. I didn't experience that with this one, but it does happen. Crack open a window and let it air out for a few days and it will dissipate.-Most standard sheets have no problem accommodating up to 15\" of mattress and topper. So if you're looking at this and want to add a topper, 3\" thick is the max before you're likely to need deep pocket sheets.For this mattress, all of that applied and it's lovely for us. It's medium firmness (supportive) but soft and plush feeling. There's almost zero motion transfer, and it sleeps comfortably cool. Mattress choice is highly individual, but I'd call this one a crowd-pleaser. An excellent value for the money and worth investing in items to protect it and keep it in its best condition for as long as possible. I'm impressed with the quality of the workmanship and how cozy it is. I'd order it again and have already recommended it to a friend who is looking to replace their current setup.",

                "reviewText": "The bed is a great hybrid between the classic supportive innerspring design and the \"new age\" gel/memory foam layers for comfort. I used to have a foam only mattress, and they're great, but after a few years they tend to lose they're supportiveness and \"sag\" in the spots that get the most wear, which can lead to trouble falling asleep, disrupted sleep, and even pain. The hybrid design style is supposed to be supportive for much longer, and since the foam is less dense, not retain heat as badly as a full foam mattress. While I can't speak to the longevity of the support, I have had better sleep from not waking up in the middle of the night in a heatsink of foam, as this does a lot to help dissipate the heat from your body as you sleep. It's also nice that it doesn't take 3 days to \"expand\" before it reaches is proper shape.",

                "reviewText": "February 6th I opened the mattress it inflated to what seems like it's full potential within hours. It's only been 1 day and this is what I have noticed.It's not going to sink when you lay on it but it is comfortable and plush. It's mostly coils. Everything covered in black has coils in it. I have no idea how it is so comfortable if it's mostly coils. It arrived with the layer on top a bit loose I was scared but I told my bf maybe that's the point of letting it inflate?? & sure enough that looseness was fill pretty quickly. I'm going to leave it out for a week. I'll flip move it around mid way through. The top coils are a bit crooked so there is a corner of the bed that doesn't look right and it bothers me a lot. Don't think there is anything I'll be able to do about that. Once I have it for awhile I'll come back. See how long it lasts before I feel all those coils. My bf is pretty heavy like the average male. So I wonder how he'll affect it. He's about 5'10 weighs about 180 lbs. Can't imagine an older bigger male being comfortable for long but we will see how he holds up.",

                "reviewText": "This mattress came vacuum packed into a giant roll and was definitely heavier than this one woman could carry on her own upstairs. Other than that, it rolled out easily and started decompressing the more plastic I peeled back. I really appreciate that the plastic covering the mattress stayed in tact because I was planning on wrapping it anyways to keep it safe from my grubby teenage son. I like the firmness of the springs and the super soft pillow top. The binding and stitching are heavy duty and this thing should really last a very long time. I would definitely get this again.",
