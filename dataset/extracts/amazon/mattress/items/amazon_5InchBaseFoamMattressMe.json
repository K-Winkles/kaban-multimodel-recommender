Soon as we put the bed together & opened this mattress we both laid down & fell asleep..Probably the best sleep I\u2019ve had in awhile. I\u2019ll be purchasing 2 more of these a twin size, & a Queen size. It\u2019s well worth the money & didn\u2019t disappoint at all. It fluffed up soon as we took it out the plastic. The 8in is pretty thick but I\u2019ll probably do the 12in for my Queen bed.",
