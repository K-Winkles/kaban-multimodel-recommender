I searched reviews on several mattress's and decided on this one. My teen daughter had fossa decompression surgery due to chiari1 she has been in pain for years. Had nerve damage, spinal cord issues and scoliosis. She could never sleep comfortably. She was seeing pain management doctors, neurologists, orthopedics, chiropractors and more. This mattress has been a blessing. She has not complained of a restless night since the purchase. I then purchased the matress for my son and daughter in-law. She was pregnant and he has back issues. They were sleeping on their couches because their mattress springs made it impossible to sleep. They are so happy with this mattress and said it's the best sleep they ever had. I 100% recommend this mattress, buying one for myself. The price is actually great for the superb quality. Love it.",

It was easy to unwrap and fully expanded within about an hour or two.No idea what people are talking about with it having a smell, I don\u2019t smell anything funky unless I put my nose right into the mattress. Even then, it\u2019s just that \u2018new from a factory\u2019 odor.I\u2019m surprised at how comfortable it is. While firm, it\u2019s also very soft supportive. I\u2019m excited to see how it performs over the next few weeks. Will update later.",

However I have memory mattress in my camper. So I knew about the firmness. You have to give yourself a week to adjust. I replaced an expensive Sealy Crown Jewel. Best thing I ever did. Great nights rest for someone that never sleeps. I love no more pain!",

After ordering this and trying out for a few weeks I found I like this one better. I was afraid it would not be firm enough for me, but still comfortable. Some mornings you just don't want to get out of bed because it feels so good. I would highly recommend this one. I'm not sure how much it really gives pain relief, but I'm still giving it a 4.",

Thought it seemed comfortable at first but then I started waking up with a lot of pain & was having sleepless nights. So I ordered this one & let me tell you it is heaven. It is the most comfortable bed I\u2019ve laid on in a while. Your body literally molds to the mattress. Like the minute I laid on it I felt like I was in heaven it was that \u201c ahhhh I\u2019m ready for bed\u201d feeling. Best thing I\u2019ve bought in a while \u201c SWIPE YOUR CARD\u201d",
