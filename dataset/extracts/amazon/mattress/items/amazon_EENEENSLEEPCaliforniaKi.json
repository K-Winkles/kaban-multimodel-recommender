Fortunately, I have no desire to return this one. It's firm, but has enough \"give\" that in turn, provides relief to my body's pressure points. I was able to feel the springs at first. Perhaps this was because I slept on it the same day it was delivered and didn't give it enough time to fully expand. This was initially fixed with the use of a padded bed topper. I'm amazed at the quality I got for the money. Top notch! All in all, a good choice which I highly recommend.Sidenote: Gotta hand it to Amazon delivery. It arrived on time and with care.",

OK, so admittedly I wasn't prepared for how quickly it sprang out of the box and started\" growing - I live in a small condo with a wall of windows, and these mattresses remind me of a certain brand of biscuits that come in a can: once you open them, they expand like crazy!I managed to corral it onto my adjustable base, on which it works perfectly! It is a tad squeaky; I believe having a headboard to help keep it in place will alleviate that.I cannot believe how comfortable such an inexpensive mattress is!! I had a (name brand) that was too stiff to work well with adjustable base; my neighbor gave me a (name brand) to try, but it was far too soft. This EEN mattress wins the Goldilocks award: it is \"just right\"!! The fact that the price is just right is a huge bonus!I know it is daunting to purchase a mattress online, but for what it's worth, I suffer from severe chronic pain in my cervical swing, lumbar spine, and SI joints - what a JOY it is to wake up pain-free!!! I find it works best if I elevate the head of the bed ever-so-slightly, but that's a matter of personal preference. If you don't have an adjustable base, I'm sure you will still love this mattress! I am moving things out of my bedroom in my cracker box condo in the sky so I can upgrade to a king ASAP: I like to sleep diagonally.I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one...I'm thrilled with it!",

The old bed frame went into a spare bedroom, and this mattress was purchased for that reason. It was very heavy to move but once we got it into the room, it was easy to remove and put on the box spring. It is very comfortable and it's reasonably priced! Highly recommend it!",

Please do not waste your money or believe the \u201cgood\u201d reviews. There is nothing good about this \u201cmattress\u201d. It\u2019s uncomfortable and feels cheap. It\u2019s VERY \u201cspringy\u201d. This mattress feels and looks like those cheaply made mattresses that were in the roll-a-way beds back in the dayIt really sucks that we are now stuck with this crap! I\u2019ve had 5 back surgeries and read each review and thought I made a good choice with this one. Man was I completely wrongI\u2019ve been sleeping on the couch ever since we got this because it\u2019s terribly uncomfortable. There is no support with this and each time my husband moves, I get bounced all around. The mattress is also very very thin\u2026.",

This mattress is less than 10 and i waited as it is recommended before using it. The corner did not enough cushioning nor support . Pros I think this mattress has potential but it needs to have more cushioning and sewing. I do like the color combination and it was not heavy to place it. The texture is smooth and feels nice on the skin. It did also fitted the queens frame nicely.",
