                "reviewText": "I have had lower back issues for years. To the point where I couldn't sleep in one position for more than maybe an hour or two. I've tried a bunch of different mattresses, the latest being a Leesa Hybrid, and not of them have helped. This Thanksgiving, we spent a week in an Airbnb and every night, I slept amazingly well. Literally woke up in the same position I fell asleep in! I looked at the mattress we were sleeping on and saw iyee nature, whatever that is, and when I got home and looked it up, I was absolutely shocked at the insanely low price. Bought it! got a full (almost $1800) refund on my Leesa, and have been sleeping awesome ever since.The mattress is firm, however the first layer a allows your body to sink in a little. Its not like other memory foam mattresses where you sink way into the mattress and can't move around. You sleep more on top of it. Honestly, best sleep I've had in years and all for less than $300!",

                "reviewText": "So I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t measure the bed frame before ordering because I assumed a twin bed would fit a twin frame. (As opposed to stuffing a twin xl into a twin frame). It seems this bed is slightly off in the dimensions. It could stand to be a couple inches shorter side to side and a couple inches longer end to end. You can see in the photo how it\u2019s pressing on the guard rail and there is space left at the end. Now, this photo was taken just as I had unrolled it so it did expand a bit over time but that would just make it bigger all around, not any thinner side to side. It was rather difficult to get the mattress cover and sheets on as it\u2019s sort of heavy as well as being a tight squeeze side to side (and on the top bunk as well)! It was for my 9 year old son and he is the only one that has slept on it so far and he says it\u2019s comfy. The bottom bunk has a 12\u201d mattress of similar make (I believe it\u2019s Hotel brand from Sam\u2019s) but I had to order an 8\u201d for the top due to needing to be shorter than the railing for safety reasons. It does seem to be of good quality. It wasn\u2019t extremely stinky or anything when we unwrapped it. The cover is soft (and I believe removable for washing). We have a kid and animals so we choose to use a mattress cover (pul lined for waterproofness) under the sheet but this adds minimal thickness since it\u2019s essentially just a liner. The cover fit easily. The regular twin sheet fit easily. Just wish the dimensions would have fit our bed a little better. I have not compared to other bed sizes so I don\u2019t know if this is a universal issue or just an issue with my bed. Over all I feel like this was a good purchase.",

I still waited for 48 hours before seeing the full potential and by 72 hours it looked like it should.The soft cover on top is really nice and has a luxurious feel to it. The blue trim around the perimeter looks sharp. The zipper works easily if you need to open up the mattress and check out the interior foam.I definitely think this a great buy and I am very happy with the mattress. I might add that I absolutely did not smell any odors from the time I opened the plastic and after the mattress had expanded.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, the mattress is good so far, and is perfect for sitting or lying in bed and watching TV, and I am not disappointed with the quality. However, their claims of medium firmness are\u2026 generous. I would call it a soft mattress. I personally prefer a bed to be just a bit less firm than a carpeted floor, but with enough padding and cushion to support my joints, so I won\u2019t hold that against them, as I knew that I would not be getting that.The bed is comfortable for sleeping on one\u2019s back, and on one\u2019s side for short periods. My problem is that I prefer to sleep on my stomach. This is not the bed for that. An oddity I noticed after opening and allowing the mattress to \u201cinflate\u201d itself is that the bead and foot of the bed are slightly higher than the middle of the bed. Not a bad thing when sleeping or lying on my back. It may even be a good thing for lying on my stomach, but it is not comfortable that way.Sitting on the bed, I sink at least 5\u201d into the mattress, so my lighter bodyweight areas are elevated. Luckily, the bed still provides enough cushion and support that I am willing to give it a good rating. I am dubious about it being a medium firmness, but like I said, I prefer very firm mattresses.TL;DR: a good mattress for the price, and very soft.",

                "reviewText": "So first the negatives, it's a little bigger than a normal full size mattress so there's some overhang on my frame, it's also very firm and holds body heat rather than dispersing it(that's probably normal) that's actually about it for negatives lol. The firmness is kind of a good thing probably, I used to sink into my spring mattress so it was extremely bad on my back. This mattress is very good on my back. It takes a while to kind of adjust to your body but I got the best nights sleep I've had in years last night(first time sleeping on it). I highly recommend it for bigger folks like myself(weight). I'm gonna probably update this review after a few weeks, but for now I can tell you I love the thing*Update* it's been about 10 days and I'm fully satisfied with this mattress. I've been getting good sleep and my back pain has improved, I don't toss and turn to get comfortable anymore. I sound like an ad but it's true. 5 out of 5",

We bought a King bed from Amazon from a different manufacturer and REGRET not buying from this manufacturer instead. Great for the price if you like a firm bed! I actually caught my Fiance\u2019 napping on this bed instead of our king! The photo I took is without a box spring. It\u2019s only on the bed frame (showing the thickness). Lesson learned.",
