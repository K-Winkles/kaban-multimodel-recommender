                "reviewText": "To clear up a lot of confusion with this mattress, here is an Honest to God review....Summary:- Mattress was easy to assemble (cut package and roll/air out)- Smell was not that bad... It's expected, so have a fan ready and air it out.- Firm version of memory foam (Perfect for bigger guys like me) But I have a hunch it breaks in over time.- Quality seemed very nice.I just received this mattress yesterday ( 8/5/2015 ). The packaging was as expected, the Cardboard box was in rough shape but the heavy duty plastic on the inside was untouched. I'm a 6'2\" 230lb athletic man that spends most of my free time in the gym, so getting the package onto my bed frame by myself was no problem at all. To a regular or smaller person, you might need an extra hand carrying the 90+lb package.Upon opening, I cut the plastic and everything went as expected. The mattress inflated itself within 30 minutes with the corners lagging behind (I just hit the corners with my hand to fluff them up and help them catch up) . I let it sit for 24 hours before laying on it. The smell is strong, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Looking at the other reviews, some of these people must have had a bad mattress, or simply can't take a little odor for a few days (they might be sensitive).Here's the biggest point... The mattress is a very firm version of memory foam. Right out of the box the mattress doesn't give in as much as you may think. It's perfect for someone like me because, like I've said, I'm 230 lbs and athletic. This thing offers the perfect support for me, giving in to my heavy points and supporting my lighter areas yet I can see somebody who's much lighter having issues. I say to those people, give the mattress time to break in. I'll update this in a few months with a follow up.Tonight will be the first night I sleep on it, and I couldn't be more excited. The 10 minutes I spend laying on it this morning almost made me fall right asleep again. I'll keep this post updated because there seems to be a lot of confusion on this mattress.* Off topic *The first one I ordered got mixed up in the mail due to the carrier, therefor I got my mattress 3 days late. Amazon's customer service was perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better crew to solve the problem.** UPDATE (08/07/2015) **- Last night was the first night that I slept on the mattress and I can honestly say I had a great night sleep. I didn't wake up in the middle of the night at all. I was cool all night (Granted I had a 17\" box fan blowing directly over me) and the only time I got hot was when my lady friend came over earlier. I'm usually a very hot sleeper and people who complain about the heat of this thing should invest in a fan. Even without the fan it was very cool at first, but it did start warming up slightly after 30 minutes or so of laying in the same spot - but it wasn't that bad.I can say that I'm very pleased with my first night on this thing.*** UPDATE 08/24/2015Sleeping on this thing has been a pleasure. It's not revolutionizing, but it's much more comfortable than my last mattress. The smell is pretty much gone although it did take awhile. The smell was honestly not that bad and the only way you could really smell it was if you stuck your nose in the mattress. I don't wake up in the middle of the night anymore from tossing and turning. That's a huge plus for me because on my old mattress It felt like I had a cycle of waking up at 3 or 4am from tossing and turning. The mattress is still very firm, but like I said before, it's perfect for me because I'm big and heavy enough to actually sink in a bit.",

                "reviewText": "By comparison to a lot of top brands this mattress is just as good and at a much much cheaper price. Shipping was fast, at first it comes rolled up and folded in half in a heavy box vaccume sealed. This is a multi density foam mattress that is soft enough to provide comfort, firm enough for support and so far maintains its shape and comes with two pillows good when sleeping on back but too high and firm for sleeping on sides or face down. The pillows are better than the expensive bobs brand though. I would recomment, especially with their trial return policy. It doesn't take long for the mattress to appear to inflate and I slept on it only after about an hour or two of inflating it. Privides great comfort, no sinking feeling, cool sleep it doesn't heat up trapping body heat.",

After a couple of nights on this bed, it was noticable that we sleep better and less aches and pains! I was very surprised on how stiff the much the mattress got after 24 hours. It's not sink in soft, it's stiff but slightly forms to your body. I'm wondering what happens with time if it will start to cave in where we sleep because we're bigger but after a week, it still feels great! Would recommend for cheaper alternative before buying an expensive bed.",

You do not feel the other person move at all in this bed. Overall I feel like this mattress is worth the money. 2/1/24 and we are still very happy with this mattress.

Almost a year with no creeks or cracks when waking and my body is super aligned! I spent one week away, slept on a pillowtop and every bone was stiff!I cannot say enough good about this bed!Original review I LOVE MY BED! we had some issues ordering a different bed from amazon and ended up ordering this instead. I hadn't done any research on this brand or bed prior to it arriving, partially because I was really busy and because I had my heart set on the other one... I'm sooooo glad that we ended up getting this bed!!! when it arrived UPS had torn through the plastic so it was expanding in the box, I think that had a bit to do with the fact that the bed expanded to full size in 30 minutes. It was really heavy so i recommend having more then one person carry it (we got the Cal-King). Some of the reviews I was reading after we got the bed stated that:#1 it didn't expand to full size - This wasn't the case for us at all!!#2 there is a bad smell - I stuck my face right into the mattress to try and smell it.. there was a slight plastic smell.. but it wasn't noticeable unless my face was pressed into the mattress.#3 the bed is poorly manufactured - this isn't the case at all, our bed is beautiful and the fabric on the sides doesn't compress the foam on the sides.. we measure 12\" on all 4 and there is no pulling of the cover anywhere.. if anything the cover is a little bit big for the foam!The cool gel works wonderful! this isn't a cooling gel so you wont lay on a cold bed in the summer time.. but when its 30+ outside at night and you go to sleep the bed doesn't get hotter!!I find the bed a bit firm.. I thought that would be a problem as I like to sleep on soft beds.. but the bed is perfect! We both wake up with no pressure or pain in our bodies. He has back problems and our old bed made them worse, this one he wakes up and is ready to go with no pain at all. I am also a light sleeper and he can get in and out of bed all night long with out waking me as the motion transfer is almost non existent.I love my classic brands mattress and in the future when we need a new bed we will be buying from these guys again!!!",

When I received it, I opened it on the floor and let it expand for 3 days, then I put it on top of the box spring. Like everything else memory foam, the dimensions are a *little* off and there's a bit of overhang on from the box spring, and a noticeable gap when fitted sheets are placed on it.I didn't think I'd like it at first, since when I first got it and went to lay on it, it felt like laying on the hardwood floor. But after just a second you start sinking in and all of a sudden you're in the comfiest bed you've laid in and you accidentally take an hour nap in it.It's about the price of a regular mattress, it performs better, and should last longer without having springs or wear and tear. Memory foam isn't for everyone so I would suggest trying one out first at a department store or something before actually buying one. I didn't have the luxury as I live in Fort McMurray, and mattress were on massive back order from the wildfire and my mom was coming up to \"surprise\" me so I didn't have time to look around. This mattress was a gamble that paid off.",

Be very careful where you unpackage this, once it is open it opens up to full size quite quickly. There is a plastic-ish smell that lasts a couple of days but I let it air out in another room with no trouble. Once the smell is gone it was time to toss out the old and place this on there. First night was great, as has every night has been since.It\u2019s hard for me to attest to the claim that it keeps your body cool as I\u2019ve only had this mattress the last month or so and it has been quite cool. I will do my best to try to update this review once the summer comes! As noted above, the mattress it quite firm but your body will sink in slowly. If you\u2019re looking for soft and squishy this may not be for you. But otherwise if you\u2019re looking for something that is firm that is memory foam, I would definitely recommend this mattress.",

                "reviewText": "Very satisfied. It came in a tiny long box (so easy for transport). Comfortable but it is not as comfortable as one of those very comfy $2,000 + mattresses I've had. For the price, it is the most comfortable we could have found. Me and my girlfriend survived on an inflatable mattress just before getting this and wow did we feel great. I was also able to get out of the bed and infiltrate back in without waking her up. The smell was there for about two to four months but after that, our home smell took over. Comfortable for all kamasutra fans but I have a hard time sleeping on the side for more than 10 to 30 minutes on this mattress. Not a big deal anyway since I always drool if I sleep on the side. So I give it a 5 on every way for this one!",
