                "reviewText": "This is the fourth bed-in-a-box I've purchased from Amazon over 7 years. If you are hesitant about buying a flattened and rolled up mattress online, don't be. This is by far the best one. I'm replacing my oldest one which is my second favorite. I used to sell mattresses, and this one looks and feels like it should cost about $1,500. I purchased the 12\" pillow-top version. I would say it's medium firm but very comfortable. I weigh 165 lbs and sitting on the edge provides plenty of support. The mattress is very heavy and will require two people to move around and unroll. It expanded to the full 12 inch thickness in about a minute and doesn't have any odor. I certainly suggest you consider this option.",

                "reviewText": "Unboxing was a little tedious but once the plastic is off the mattress expands pretty quickly. I let it sit for about 30 hours but probably didn\u2019t need that long. I prefer a firm mattress and this one is definitely firm and good quality for the price. I\u2019ve only had it a week but so far so good!",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with this mattress -it rolled up and arrived tightly compressed in a strong box, and once we finally got it out of the plastic, it started puffing out immediately. I did wait for 48 hours until using as I did not want to disturb anything before it was ready. The mattress is on the firmer side, but that is a good thing. I like that this is a hybrid mattress with gel memory foam and coils. The fabric is very nice and the bed seems to be well made. So far, I am very happy with this mattress!",

It expands pretty well out the package and is heavy and durable. The handles made me buy it over another option, happy I did.",
