                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Olee Gel Memory Foam Full Mattress, and it has transformed my sleep experience. Here's why I can't stop raving about it:Unmatched Comfort: The gel memory foam provides an incredible level of comfort. It contours to my body, offering the perfect balance of support and softness. Every night feels like a dream.Cooling Technology: The gel-infused memory foam does an excellent job of regulating temperature. I no longer wake up feeling overheated; instead, the mattress keeps me cool and comfortable throughout the night.Full-Body Support: The mattress provides full-body support, alleviating pressure points. I wake up without any aches or stiffness, which has significantly improved my overall sleep quality.Quality Construction: The construction of the Olee mattress is top-notch. The materials used are durable, and the craftsmanship is evident. It's a long-term investment in quality sleep.Undisturbed Sleep: The mattress effectively minimizes motion transfer. This means that even if there's movement on one side of the bed, the other side remains undisturbed, allowing for a peaceful night's sleep.Overall, I am thrilled with my Olee Gel Memory Foam Full Mattress. It's not just a mattress; it's a ticket to a restful and rejuvenating night's sleep. If you're in search of unparalleled comfort and quality, I highly recommend giving this mattress a try. It's a game-changer!",

                "reviewText": "Shipping was very fast and I received it earlier than I expected. My one year old son and I have been sleeping on an air mattress because our pillow top mattress was involved in a hit and run accident during our last move about two months ago. I knew I wanted a memory foam mattress (I LOVE my mom's) so I read tons of reviews on tons of different memory foam mattresses. It was really difficult to choose one.I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a bad odor when I removed the packaging from my mattress. I read some reviews on other mattresses saying that their mattress nearly killed them when opening it because it sprung to life. Thankfully, that did not happen to me even though I was prepared for it. I'm sure I looked like a SWAT team member opening the package. It rolled out nicely and immediately began expanding once the plastic wrap was removed. It had a new smell but it was very very faint.I read on the instructions that it may take 72 hrs to fully expand, but I considered sleeping on it the first night because it had already expanded the full eight inches. BUT as difficult as it was, I waited until the second night lol \ud83d\ude01This is my second night of sleeping on it and all I can say is that it feels amazing. It isn't hard in my opinion, but not so soft that you feel like you're being eaten by a marshmallow (I'm claustrophobic so that would never work). I would say it is medium firmness. It actually conforms to your body. I haven't gotten hot either and I'm one of those people that cannot sleep hot. There's absolutely no smell at all now. It actually vanished within a few hours. One thing I did notice is that this bed is a good bit larger than my queen pillow top mattress. I was planning on using the same box spring under this mattress but I'm thinking I might need a platform bed or something longer and wider. It definitely isn't a problem for me since I need all the room I can get (my little one is a bed hog).Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my decision to buy this mattress. I really hope it lasts for a long time. I'll definitely update this review in a few weeks. Hopefully, I'll still be loving it. For all you fellow mattress hunters out there, this bed is awesome!**** UPDATE*****Okay so I said I would update in a few weeks, but it's obviously been a lot longer than that. 4 or 5 months, I guess? The point is, I'm still as happy with this mattress as I was the first night I slept on it. It still looks brand new and there aren't any indentations from where we sleep on it every night. And I pretty much sleep in the exact same spot every night. Since this was a worry of mine, I'm happy that it's holding strong. Honestly, I've never slept on a bed that is more comfortable. Not even once have I gotten hot in this bed and I live in the south. I read a review saying that it isn't suitable to use on a platform bed and I'm confused as to why the buyer thought this. I ended up buying a platform bed since this mattress was too big to fit on top of my box spring. It hasn't affected the comfort or condition of this mattress. I'm super happy with this purchase and I've even considered buying another one in king size since I'm expecting baby number two. My mom agrees that this mattress is even more comfortable than hers, which she bought on sale for $1,200 at a mattress store. I'll update again as time goes on, but I don't foresee me feeling any different about this incredible mattress. I hope not anyway, since I love it so much!",

                "reviewText": "After looking at twin mattresses and the price range for them I came across this \"Olee Sleep 6 inch Ventilated Multi Layered Memory Foam Mattress\". They were about $70. I read up on the different layers of the mattress in its description. I also read the good and the bad reviews. The bad reviews did make me hesitate buying this mattress. I read a couple reviews stating the mattress did not expand to the full 6 inches. I remember one reviewer complaining about the corners didn't expand properly and others about a chemical smell. I hesitated but found myself coming back because of the price, the 6 inch thickness and \"the multi layered combination of memory foam and High density Support Foam\". The price was right not to minchin I needed two twin mattresses so I took the chance and purchased two of these \"Olee Sleep 6 inch Ventilated Multi Layered Memory Foam Mattress\" and I'm glad I did. I knew for the price I wasn't getting a \"Tempurpedic\" but I did want it comfortable enough for a child to sleep on. When the mattresses arrived I opened them up and placed them on the bed and let the expand. There was a slight chemical smell but it wasn't pungent. The light chemical smell dissipated as the mattresses expanded to size. They both have no chemical smell after the mattresses expanded to there full twin 6 inch thick size corners as well. I have laid on the mattress and they are supportable and comfortable for even an adult. I thought I would feel the bars of the the day bed frame while sitting or laying on the matters but I don't. My final thoughts on this \"Olee Sleep 6 inch Ventilated Multi Layered Memory Foam Mattress\" is it is worth buying. Keep in mind the money your spending and I feel if you are a reasonable thinker this mattress will live up to or exceed your expectations.",
