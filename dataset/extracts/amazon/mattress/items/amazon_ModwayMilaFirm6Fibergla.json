The mattress itself is good\u2014a little thin but if you get a mattress topper it\u2019s perfect! It\u2019s firm as advertised, and comfortable. I got the Full XL size and I\u2019m so happy to have gotten this rarer size for cheap. That was the main reason I bought this mattress.The seller firstofakind is so annoying! They messaged me like 4 times asking if I still wanted the mattress, and if I didn\u2019t respond they were going to assume I didn\u2019t want it and they\u2019d cancel my order. I ordered the item knowing it was out of stock for a certain period of time. All they had to do was tell me it\u2019s more delayed than AMZ will allow, and give me a step by step of what was to happen next. That\u2019s it!I\u2019m unsure why the policy for delayed items is harassing your customers, but okay. I thought I was getting scammed for about a month because of this. Wouldn\u2019t recommend the seller, but absolutely would recommend the product.",

Also have Zinus mattress whcih was bought few years back. Out of the 3 Zinus is the firmest and have stayed the same way for years. Aveline looks like a better quality but softer than Zinus and Mila is the softest and not as good quality as Aveline. This mattress will not used daily hence I am keeping it. Its not good if you are planning like a day bed where you plan to sit as well. Sleeping experience is little better but if you are looking for a firm mattress then this is not it.",
