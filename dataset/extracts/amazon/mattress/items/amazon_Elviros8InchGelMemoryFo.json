I did a lot of research and reading of reviews before buying, and this one lives up to all the good reviews. Absolutely NO smell, and within minutes of unrolling it was expanded to full height, evenly and all around. Could have slept on it immediately. With two sleeping surfaces giving options for degree of firmness, we prefer the softer side. We are average-sized people (140lb and 180lb) and after 3 weeks of sleeping, no signs of depressions in the foam. My only minor criticism is that the cover is slippery, my Allergen mattress protector slides around on it a little. Nothing a new protector won\u2019t solve, I hope.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after multiple failed attempts at other mattresses because I needed something that would work with the adjustable base that I bought. I instantly fell in love with this mattress it\u2019s super comfortable and I love that it has one side firm, and one side softer as I myself prefer a soft bed and my partner prefers a firm bed so whenever they\u2019re around all I have to do is flip the mattress over. The only downside that I can see is the fine print on your warranty. Make sure you keep this double covered at all times. Otherwise you cannot get any service on it should it fail or need to be replaced. They will not service it if it has any stains or has gotten wet, thankfully I had a secondary mattress protector on hand.",

That being said\u2026it is VERY FIRM, and I\u2019m saying that as someone who likes a firm mattress. But it\u2019s not my bed - it is for my sons room and he doesn\u2019t care, he likes it, but when he jumps into bed it\u2019s more like a thud.",
