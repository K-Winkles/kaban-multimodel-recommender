        "description": "Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe Gel Memory Foam 12-Inch Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel memory foam automatically adjusts to your body\u2019s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, this cooling mattress offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. The latest technology in gel foam beds, this bed mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of transitional comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. The feel of this classic bed in a box gel mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. This 12-inch memory foam mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Vibe mattresses in a box are made using premium materials and skilled craftsmanship and are backed up by a 10-Year Manufacturer's Limited Warranty.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered another mattress a hybrid for a little less money and for some reason, a few days later I was browsing something else and then looked at my order, and pulled up the mattress info I just ordered. I delved into the customer reviews which I usually pay closer attention to but I was focused on the low price. I read review after review with a bunch of really unhappy customers. So many that I freaked out a little and went to cancel my order and although I thought it would be too late it was not. So I dove back into the mattress pages and after about 6 hours of serious shopping, I found the Vibe. I read every review and there was 77% rated it a 5. There were a couple of haters (there always are)and they were complaining about fiberglass, and apparently, this product had an issue with fiberglass particles sloughing off of it. That didn't make sense 77% gave it a 5. Then I see the company got sued for the fiberglass and then I saw it, the review was from 2013. I did some further research and found yes the company was sued years ago for the fiberglass issue but this problem was rectified completely years ago. So after that, it looks like the company went really hard into quality control and is certified by several companies as 100% all good! Now, I am a 60+ disabled veteran, and the mattress I had, was really soft and comfy but was now leaving me in agony every morning. It was horrible. So I ordered the Vibe Twin XL and paid a little over $200 for it and the price was right in my wheelhouse. It came in a very manageable box, 40 lbs totally deflated, and in two thick plastic bags. I freed the mattress and placed it on my bed frame, wooden slats are fine. Almost immediately, after 1/2 hour, my 12-inch mattress was now 10 inches thick so I could sleep on it that night. It takes about 24 hours to completely reach its full size. There was zero odor, zero issues. The top few inches are some really luxurious dense memory foam. They say it's medium plush but I disagree, I think it is more like medium, medium firm. I went to bed early and slept all night for once in a long time but when I got up, I sat right up and there was... NO PAIN!! I'll always be a little stiff due to age and several motorcycle accidents, but man I was so happy! There is a 10-year warranty as well but for $210 I am ecstatic. I weigh 265lbs. I am fine. The bed is firm but with the memory foam top layers, it is also soft in just the right way. I don't know what else to say, great mattress, great price, Prime delivery 0%. Very very very happy.",

                "reviewText": "After researching for many months (you know the drill: Consumer Reports, paid articles, YouTube, etc.) we had the opportunity to test ride a Vibe bed for 10 nights at a friends home. We loved it. The friend had simply needed a bed quickly and he saw that the Vibe is an Amazon Choice. He ordered it and then bought another. I saw the price and clicked \"Buy Now\"!I would agree with the assessment that it is \"medium firm\". But this subject has been butchered by opinions from so many directions, it's a joke. To qualify: if you are familiar with memory foam bedding, \"medium firm\" is IMO, accurate. If you have been sleeping on a classic inner spring mattress, you might call it soft or \"medium soft\". Let's clarify.Beds like this have \"pressure relieving\" softness on top. The Vibe has two inches of it. It really feels soft on the hips and shoulders. But...this bed is also really firm in terms of back support. I think it is the perfect combination of comfort and support - great for sleeping on your back, stomach or side. We have slept on Tempurpedic brand beds and found them comfortable but actually \"hard\" compared to the Vibe.Our history has been classic moderately expensive inner spring mattresses. Plush from Stearns and Foster. Pillow top from Sealy. Each was about $1000 for just the mattress. The vibe is so good I would have been OK with paying that again. But we didn't! Ours was $266 (it will be plus or minus based on the day you buy).One complaint which we think will resolve itself. Everyone has a different sense of smell. My wife smells stuff I don't and vice versa. The Vibe has an odor. We have been airing it out for a couple days. It does seem to be dissipating.I attached a picture of the bed about 30 minutes after we released it from it's plastic captivity. Fun to watch. It's about 11\" high and soft. By the next day it was the full 12\" and the firmness set in. While you could probably sleep on this bed right away, we recommend waiting several days for the odor to fade and for the total firmness factor to be established.Based on the hundreds of reviews and sales pitches I have read, I don't think you would do better if you spent 4 or 5 times the price - and that is easy to do. If this bed is still performing well in 5 years, then all my effusiveness will be an understatement. Wow. What a bed.Update a few months later: The odor we mentioned has all but disappeared. We have been using this mattress in the guest room and as a secondary bed when one of us is ill. We like it so much that we are planning to swap it with the mattress in the master bedroom. It will be the primary bed for us. I think you could easily spend 3x this price and possibly be less happy. Highly recommend.Update June 2021. We made the swap. The Vibe is our every night bed. Wonderful. Almost zero motion transfer. Awesome back support. I see that the price is now more. It is still a bargain. Best bed ever.",

                "reviewText": "I have read that some people can't sleep on this mattress. I had a pillow top mattress for about 14 years. Finally broke down and purchased new beds. Do to our age we went with adjustable beds and these 12 inch mattresses. It is soft but you don't sink down all that much. I have been using maybe 3 weeks now and do to no space on side of bed I get on from end. I have not hit the mattress retainer once yet the edges have some Good stability to them so you don't sink in that far. I fall asleep before the message function times out (15 minutes or so) and have slept past the alarm 2x so far. I find the bed incredibly comfortable but I am a heavy person. Over 300lbs. A lighter person might find it a bit stiff and unforgiving. Mind you the wife is over 100 but under 200 that is all I am allowed to say and she says it is very comfortable for her also. Our mattresses touch but I don't feel her turning over and she doesn't feel me turning over. But her snoring is still as loud as any freight train. Purchased deep fitted sheets and wake up with a corner off every morning, but that might be me finding comfy position with adjustable bed. Oh ya also they work very well with adjustable bed. They bend not crease or kink. The cover that is on the mattresses has a zipper so it can be either washed or dry cleaned, I'll have to find instructions or look on label. I am a side sleeper also as is wife and no problem holding position and shoulder sinks in a bit but not a lot. One final thing we both will get on one mattress to just watch TV or snuggle and well the old pillow top because she lite and I am not she would either lay on angel or I would get sore from her weight pressing on me because of how far mattresses was sunk down. NOT ANY MORE!!!! Now we lay beside each other and 1 I am not sunk in 6 inch (ya it was time for new bed ) any more so she is beside not above fallin into the sinkhole. Oh yes another important thing was that there was almost no smell when the mattresses opened which was surprising and it only took about 1 hour for them to get to full height or so they looked full height. And as you can see from the video that I included the sex is fantastic on this mattress. Haha ya perv there is no video you will have to find that stuff out on your own. We are very satisfied with this purchase we just wish we would have done it a lot sooner. Oh ya I have not woke up with a sore back since getting this bed and mattress.UPDATE.It is now January and have been using mattress for a couple of months. It is med firm and I sleep perfect as does wife. We purchased 2 for a split king. Should have done this 30 years ago. We don't know if the other rolls over anymore or gets up to go to washroom. It is like sleeping by yourself with someone beside you it is perfect. In 3 to 5 years I will have no problem replacing then mattresses if they need it as they are paying for themselves every night and sometimes a little in the day too. When the kids mattresses need replaced it will be this type of mattress. I have spent over 1000 on mattress and it was no where near as comfortable as this and after a year it had little bunch ups on the pillow top. This mattress no bunchup no swet and the cover comes off for wash. Greatest but I have done I think. Oh ya one more thing almost forgot I dont wake up with sore back anymore and if I go to bed with sore back it might not be better in morning but it is not any sore and I never woke up 20x with sharp pains. Cause these mattresses alow your body to take natural pose while sleeping instead of you molding to its shape.Upupdate: 2 years later and I still sleep great on it. The wife likes to lay on her side and says the medium is to hard so I am looking for a soft or plush for Christmas but can find in a 10 inch but not a 12 inch and they have actually doubled in price. That's nuts guess I will have to look elsewhere",

It took the full 72 hours (so be patient) for the bed to get to full size but man, is it ever nice and comfy and sturdy. It is a great memory foam bed for a decent price. Medium firm feeling and the sides do not overly sag down when you sit on side of mattress. I've had two memory foam beds previously and this is very comparable to a pricier mattress.",

                "reviewText": "I've been leery of memory foam for the past several years because last time I laid down on memory foam, it was deeply dissatisfying. The wife and I wanted to buy a new mattress because ours was on its last wheels, but didn't want to shell out $1200 for one from Sleep Country, so we looked around and came across this. Another reviewer said that while it's soft, plush, and has some give, it only sinks the first inch or so, and then it's firm. So based on that, we decided to give it a whirl, and man are we impressed. Very comfortable sleep, zero noise or creaking, and there was no odor, nor did it take much time at all to fill out to its full size. Very happy with our purchase.",
