                "reviewText": "This mattress topper is insanely comfortable!! I had purchased one of those bed-in-a-box mattresses about 2 years ago and never really loved it. I sleep on my right side all of the time, and I was getting very bad muscle spasms on my left side. I was actually sleeping with a heating pad draped over my side to try and at least limit the spasms as best I could. I assumed it was from sleeping in the same position night after night. Then I researched it and found that side sleepers like me need a mattress that isn't too firm. So rather than buying a whole new mattress I purchased this topper. I unfurled it mid-morning and by bedtime it was ready to go. WOW!! Talk about an amazing night's sleep! Not just that but when I woke up my body wasn't sore at all, which was so welcome since I also suffer from very chronic back pain. It didn't solve my back pain since it's aggravated by other activities and by being tall, but when I lay on my bed now I just feel completely enveloped with comfort and relief. As for the pain in my side, that's almost completely gone already. I simply can't believe what a difference this 3\" topper has made to my well being.As for the odor, my bed is made using a bamboo mattress pad, then a fitted sheet over that. After 5 days of sleeping on this I can still smell a very slight odor from the topper. I am hyper-sensitive to odors because I am a chronic migraine sufferer, so when I lay down my ears start to ring which is usually a sign a migraine is coming. But it hasn't yet caused a headache so to me the odor isn't enough to put me over the edge in that way. And I'm assuming that over time even this slight odor will dissipate. Perhaps since I didn't air the topper out for the recommended 48 hours after opening it and I then encased it in both the mattress pad and fitted sheet that it may take a little more time for the off-gassing to cease.One thing I'm thinking might happen is the topper may eventually bow in where I sleep but I can always turn it 180 degrees around, and then after it bows in again turn it over and continue to rotate it.I recommend you take a chance on this! I'm not being paid for my review with any perks, it's my genuine opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two twin xl mattresses so I could make a daybed that converts to a king bed for guests. The mattresses have fabric with grip on the bottom, so when we lay them next to each other, they don\u2019t slip apart. Then I just put a king size mattress topper on them to hide the seam between them and done! Guests kept telling me the bed was super comfy, and I thought they were just being nice, but now after sleeping on it myself a few times, I can confidently say it\u2019s a very comfy mattress. My husband and I are both bigger people and we find the 10 inch mattress still supports us without any complaints. It\u2019s a nice medium firmness, but I would imagine a super small individually would find it pretty firm. I still think even then, adding an additional mattress pillow top eliminates any complaints if you don\u2019t like the firmness. My husband loves them so much we are talking about buying another one to replace our mattress in our room. Highly recommend!",

It is a little more firm than I would like, but it was great to just get it delivered, opened the box and done. No having to get a truck and haul it in. I will buy another one for the other room.",

Since we\u2019ve had it for a while, we\u2019ve noticed that one side seems more firm than other side is squishier/softer. I\u2019m reading the mattress three stars, because I wish both sides were the same amount of firmness.",
