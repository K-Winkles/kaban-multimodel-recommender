I love it because the value for the price that I pay is amazing I have bought two of these mattresses within the last eight years or so. The only reason why I replaced it. The first time is because my daughter is in continent and was having a lot of accidents and this mattress is fluid resistant but if fluids sit on the mattress for too long, then it can permeate that protective covering. I\u2019ve learned to use another layer of protection underneath her sheets and that totally fix the problem. I love this mattress fits in her bed perfectly and it does not slide around. The covering can be removed and washed. It is actually very comfortable and I have definitely slept on it. My daughter sleeps amazingly on it every single night. If I ever need to replace her mattress, this is exactly the one that I\u2019m going to buy every single time.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my elderly mother who recently had a stroke and has issues with incontinence overnight. When the mattress came it was vacuum sealed in a box that was approximately 1x1x4ft. After opening the packaging the mattress needs some time to expand, in my case I let it sit for about 4 hours and it looked like it was ready.It fits perfectly on her adjustable hospital bed and it bends easily when the head or foot of the bed is adjusted. Since it is a foam mattress without coils inside any adjustable bed should work properly. It is a little thicker than a normal hospital mattress so you may need to adjust the height of the bed if it is for a person who has mobility issues. It also comes equipped with handles on the side, and the mattress itself is light, around 25lbs. This makes it easy to adjust or slide a person on and off or transfer them off the bed.The comfort is excellent for the money. My mother loves it and instead of waking up constantly throughout the night she is able to stay asleep. The interior consists of several layers of polyurethane foam in different densities so that it feels soft and conforms to the person laying on it, while at the same time providing a firm base of support. This means it will keep the spine in proper alignment and allow proper circulation while still feeling soft and comfortable.This is the best choice to replace a hospital mattress or use on an adjustable bed. For $130 you will not find anything that is more comfortable or sturdy in this price range. The foam construction means there are no coils to poke or prod you while asleep, and it provides proper support. It would even be great as a guest room mattress or for use on a daybed. All in all it is the most economical way to get a decent twin mattress without breaking the bank. 5/5 stars!",

It is easy to clean.It isn't the most comfortable mattress I have slept on, but it is so much sturdier and easier to clean than waterproof mattress pads.Overall would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very pleased with this purchase. I had an inflatable pressure point mattress but it stopped holding air and insurance won't replace it for another 2 years. The company wanted almost $200 just to come look at it so I decided to just purchase a new mattress instead, since it was cheaper than the service call. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I'm completely satisfied. It really is a quick and easy setup. It came flat and vacuum sealed but once you cut the plastic off, it begins to rise almost instantly. I waited a couple of hours and then had it put on my bed. It fits my hospital bed frame perfectly. The twin xl sheets I have fit great. It doesn't slide around. Thicker than I expected it to be. It's firm yet comfortable. Wish I had purchased this sooner, now that I have it and I recommend it for sure. I have not gotten it wet yet, but it has an easy wipe cover. It's possible that liquid could soak through, but you're going to experience that with any mattress, even the inflatable. Use chucks if someone has incontinence, but if you don't have them available, I'm sure this mattress is much easier to clean than a lot of other options.",
