                "reviewText": "This mattress sprang to life upon opening it! The fabric is soft, the top is plush, and there is a nice balance of spring and cushion. I like that there aren't weird designs stitched on the top that can make strange sinkholes when laying down. I bought it for my daughter and I think it will last her years to come. It's also comfortable enough for me in the event I'm called in when she can't sleep. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't had it long and I have a suspicion the plush top will flatten easily and make the springs feel more noticeable. Something about it doesn't seem solid/thick enough to maintain good padding. For the price, it was definitely worth it though!",

We allowed the mattress to puff out to 24 hours before laying on it, but you can wait for the recommended 72 hours. First night sleeping on it, no body pain! It\u2019s not as fluffy as I thought it would be as advertised \u201cplush\u201d, it\u2019s definitely firm but I believe breaking it in after months of sleep it might get fluffier. Definitely worth the price!Delivery-Make sure you or someone is able to be home during delivery for this item, Amazon sends you a password to give to the delivery person. I didn\u2019t see this mentioned in the reviews. Thought it would be good to let some know!",

                "reviewText": "I was a little nervous ordering a mattress without trying it first, but it is SO comfortable. It's just firm enough to support my joints, but it's cozy and soft right where I need it. I can lay in any position and feel supported and comfortable.It's pretty heavy, so you might need help if you're a smaller build. The little slicer they provide is a joke, so I just used a box cutter (slowly and carefully so I didn't cut the mattress). Make sure you open it at the end so the air rushes out and lets the mattress expand while you remove the rest of the plastic.It says to let it sit for 24-72 hours. Mine was almost fully expanded after several hours, but I let it sit for 48 hours. I slept on it that night, and it was fine. I didn't notice any off-gassing, even though it's winter here and my windows are shut. There wasn't any odor at all, which was nice.",

I got the full size and it's kinda heavy, about 50 pounds I think, but it wasn't that hard to get out of the box or get on the bed frame. The little letter opener type tool is a joke. I used my scissors, just be careful not to cut your mattress. There's 2 layers of plastic, one keeps it rolled and the other keeps it sealed. Once on the frame and the plastic removed it started to expand right away but it only got to 8 inches. I let it sit for the recommended 3 days but it never got to 10 as in their description, the reason for the 4 stars. As with any new mattress it may take first few nights to get used to, my back hurt a little at first. The mattress is bouncy so no motion isolation like the ad says, and the edges are a little flimsey, it almost feels like I'm sliding off when I go to get up, but it's comfy and I sleep well. They offer a 100 night trial and I would send it back and get a true memory foam but how the heck would I get it back in the box. If you don't like bouncy, don't get this mattress but it IS soft and comfy.",
