We have had it for a few months and we are pleased with it. It's not too thick so it fits under on the trundle perfectly and is also comfortable enough for her friends who sleepover. I personally would not purchase it as a mattress that would be slept on daily, but it is good quality for an extra guest mattress that won't be used regularly.",

                "reviewText": "Like the description said, it came in a box. A little heavy but if youre strong, its a breeze. It fits great on a metal bed frame (also from Amazon). This is my second night sleeping on it, no back pains. Its durable as well, theres no spring indents. Its great for back sleepers, but it feels comfortable enough when sleeping on the side. Two adults can sit on here without it indenting. Overall, this is great if youre looking for affordable, ready to use mattress. But if youre really looking for overall comfortability, then I'd suggest looking into a memory foam one. BUT if youre like me and dont care, as long as youre not sleeping on the floor, then this mattress is great.",

                "reviewText": "Just remove the plastic and roll it out... instructions says take 24-48 hours to fully decompress. My photos show it at 24 hours so am hoping another 24 hours will smooth out all the wrinkles and make it look less frumpy. The inner springs are definitely plastic, you can hear scrunchy plastic noises when sitting or laying on it and can slightly feel the springs so if you suffer from princess-and-the-pea syndrome it will definitely need an additional foam topper for best comfort. But then maybe that is also something another 24 hours will resolve.As it is I purchased it for a daybed in our spare room hoping it wouldn't be too soft for sitting on and comfortable enough for occasional use by my daughter and granddaughter when they visit. It seems firm enough to handle the sitting, time will tell on the sleeping.I will try to post an update if everything improves ... otherwise, for now, It'll Do.",

Definitely would not recommend for anyone other than a very small child.",

Great support, pretty comfortable even for adults. It isn't fancy but it isn't awful either. My daughter has a spring mattresses which is terrible compared to this. Great buy!
