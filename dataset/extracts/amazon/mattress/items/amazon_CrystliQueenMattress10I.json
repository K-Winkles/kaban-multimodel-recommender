                "reviewText": "I did my research on mattresses in a box before deciding on this one, and I will admit I was still hesitant about moving forward with the purchase because I've never bought one of these before. I chose this mattress due to the hybrid construction and the 100 night guarantee, and the reviews seemed really solid. I purchased the 10 inch twin size. It arrived on time, was easy to get into the house and a breeze to open. Immediately upon opening the plastic wrap and unrolling it, the mattress starting inflating in size. Within 10 minutes, it was already at 10 inches, so I was pleasantly surprised. It is easy to move, at least in the twin size, so it can be put on a foundation and taken off easily. The top cover is very nice and overall, the construction is solid. It is a medium firm mattress, so if you're looking for a soft mattress, this isn't it. Of course, all mattresses require a breaking in time, so I expect in a few months, this mattress will be a lot softer. I actually bought a 2 inch memory form topper for it for extra cushion and that helped immensely with the comfort level until at least I have it broken in more. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, especially for the price, easy of set up and quality. It remains to be seen how this mattress will perform over time, but so far, I really like it. There are so many mattresses in a box out there to choose from and it can be overwhelming. If you'd looking for an good, solid mattress on a bit on the firmer side for a good price, this is it. I'm pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this mattress because where I bought 100% of all my mattresses and box springs for over the last 30 years closed VERY sadly namely Sears. I had to buy a new mattress because the one my 18yo son who is 6'3\" 280ish was sleeping on was giving him back pain. This mattress exceeded all of my expectations of comfort and quality and immediately solved my son's back discomfort and pain. The fact the nearest mattress store to me is now a 25 minute drive AND the affordable price of the mattress made me willing to buy it untied. In y suns opinion it offers a very good balance of plush comfort and support for an XXL heavy male. I tried the mattress and would agree with my sons evaluation.Now for the ONLY criticism.We liked this mattress so well I went to order one for my other son (also XXL 6'+ 280+) and to my complete shock the price had GONE UP by over $130 now placing it's cost close enough to an OTC mattress purchase I decided to go buy a full size mattress from the local store as the near hour round trip is now justified due to the cost factors are equal. If this mattress can be had at it's original price of $130 less than current than yes it is well worth buying, but at its current price I would recommend you buy OTC alternative.",

I knocked a star down because you can feel some of the springs in the mattress but it's only very slight. It's definitely a good quality product.",

I would recommend you add either a waterproof mattress cover or waterproof zipable bag cover as there doesnt appear to be an easy way to clean it.This mattress is very soft. You will not need to add a mattress topper for comfort. It fits well into a full size platform bed.There doesnt appear to be any difference in tempature with this mattress compared to the previous mattress.Overall its a very nice mattress.",

                "reviewText": "We had a $200, 6 year old, all foam mattress that needed to go. After sleeping on that mattress for so long I wanted to find something with springs to avoid my partner and I rolling to the middle of the bed all night due to lack of support. We were on a tight budget so went with this one due to the decent reviews, we weren't expecting much though, just better than what we had. But this bed is amazing! It's more firm than I am used to but have no problems as a side sleeper with hip issues. The springs have just enough give but also just enough bounce back, if that makes sense. The foam is nice and actually feels like it shapes to you, but not like you're sinking. It also stays cool, we are hot sleepers and I've found that im searching less and less for the cold spots on the bed. Overall we are really happy we went with this bed, and are kicking ourselves for waiting for so long, thinking we would need to spend more on a bed than we actually do. And maybe our standards were just so low that anything would impress us, who knows. But we are more than happy with this bed",

I did let it sit for 3 days before I did sleep on it and it only made me cherish the moment I could finally sleep on it be even more. It did not have this \"smell\" people were talking about in the other reviews when it was filling up. My only concern is the middle of the mattress with how it was folded, there is a pretty noticible line down the middle of it. But feeling wise, I do not even notice it is there when I am lying down on it. Regarding the longevity, I will update my review once anything else of concern happens. Overall 5/5 I would recommend this mattress, save yourself some money and get it.",
