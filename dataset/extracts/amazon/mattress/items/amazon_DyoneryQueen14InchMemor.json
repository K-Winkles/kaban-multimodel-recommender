                "reviewText": "I have never slept on memory foam before, because I was imagining sleeping on a giant cleaning sponge. That did not seem appealing to me at all. Also, some of the other memory foam products I have used, smelled unpleasant even after letting them air out and treating them with deodorizers. I have tried many memory foam pillows and seat cushions. Fortunately, this is not the case with this mattress. It does not feel like a giant sponge and smell terrible. The cooling effect is only temporary, because your body warms up the mattress gradually as you sleep. I found that rolling over every once and awhile it become cool again if you move some, which I do. If you like soft mattresses that you sink into, this is great. If you like firm mattresses, then this is not so great. Unfortunately, I wish the mattress to be more firm. Don't get me wrong, I have had some of the greatest sleep ever on this mattress. It does a great job of relieving pressure throughout my body, so I can relax, maybe a little to well. The size of the mattress fits perfectly for my bed. Also, it's definitely a very high quality material that hasn't shown any signs of wear after a month. This seems like it will last longer than old box spring mattress if it's cared for. To me, that makes it worth the money you spend if it lasts. I haven't experience any real issues with this at all, so I'm going to give it 5 stars.",
