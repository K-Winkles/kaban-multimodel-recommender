I was able to bring it inside by myself, im 64 yrs old. It was easy to open and place on my bed frame. It was completely done fluffing up by bedtime. When I laid down on my bed it was soft, cradles your body. I loved it, but....when I went to turn around, I had some trouble. Your sunk into the mattress. Not sunk in like the mattress just swallowed you whole but with my bad back, it was tough trying to turn over. After giving the mattress 1 week for me to get use to it, I loved it. The only thing I do regret is not getting the mattress cover that keeps your body cool. I do get hot under the covers some nights which I never have done with spring mattresses. It's really good in the winter because it will keep you warm, but in the summer, you'll wish you got the mattress cover. I have no regrets buying this mattress other than the mattress cover. I will probably end up going back and getting it.",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve had this mattress out for almost 72 hours with 2 nights of sleep. Was not impressed.#1 our mattress never went to its full size. Each corner was dented in and it caused the middle to be much higher than the rest of the bed.2. It advertised this mattress as a 6.5 between firmness and softness. We needed some sort of firmness so that I could breastfeed, yet be soft enough to be comfortable. I haven\u2019t found firmness. After sitting (or applying too much pressure at pressure points of the body) I sink so far in that my MIDDLE BACK feels the mattress. This also makes it extremely hard to breastfeed. When trying to adjust, the baby sinks into the pressure spots (as I apply more pressure than she does due to adult vs child). Even after NUMEROUS pillows, there is just no support, especially since the mattress never evened out.3. The last 2 nights of sleeping on this mattress, I\u2019ve awaken with pain in one of my legs. (I have to sleep on my side to breastfeed and I alternate throughout the night). And the pain hasn\u2019t died down. This mattress was advertised to ease pain, not cause it- but I\u2019m having the opposite effect.Ultimately, we will be trying to return this ASAP.Update!: we decided to keep it a little longer and allow it to shape/form correctly.We placed it on an actual bed support and it was immediately a change for the better. I\u2019m not sure if all the cushion on carpeted floor was the reason, but it was night & day after putting it on a platform bed.Super comfortable, and the movement doesn\u2019t effect everyone sleeping in the bed. Reminds me of that wine commercial mattress. I haven\u2019t done wine, but I\u2019ve done a glass of water and it held place while I got off the bed. It hugs your body without making you feel like you\u2019re sinking into the mattress. Super comfortable & the mattress shaped itself out in a few days after my initial review.No body pains, better sleep, and even my husband doesn\u2019t snore as much or as loud when he does snore. Definitely such a difference from when he falls asleep on the couch watching tv. SO grateful we gave it time & kept it! Definitely a gem for a fraction of the cost of other mattresses. \ud83d\udcaf",

                "reviewText": "I'd slept on a memory foam mattress for the last 7 years and it was great. A sealy brand mattress. I tried this one out as it's a much better price. It's comfortable, and stable, but a little firmer than I expected. I'm a heavy guy, so this firmness is recommended for me. I now know I prefer a slightly softer mattress.That said, some back pain I've had after sleeping on a very firm spring mattress for a few months has subsided some.",

Mine unpackaged into the expected shape - no weird twists or lumps. It\u2019s the perfect, expected shape of a bed. It is very soft and comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the copper nectar mattress since it is specifically designed to help prevent overheating while sleeping, and I am absolutely and completely happy with my purchase! I also ordered one of their bed frames and both arrived the same day. I'm impressed with the care and thoughtfulness, specifically with the frame, and you can tell just from opening the packages that their products are of high quality. The mattress does take about four hours to breathe and open all the way, which wasn't a problem for me. I had been waking each morning with lower back pain and not having slept well on my old mattress. The Nectar mattress is outstanding! They mention finding the right medium between softness and firmness and they're spot on in my opinion! I fall asleep quickly and stay asleep longer than normal, even hitting REM sleep which was infrequent before. I don't overheat and wake rested. I love my new bed and look forward to many more pleasant nights of sleep.",

I used to think I was a super light sleeper, turns out I just had a bad mattress. I go back to sleep faster when I wake up in the middle of the night and when I wake up I feel more rested. My body has less aches and pains. I feel like my whole day is better because I\u2019m sleeping the same amount but the quality of sleep is way better. If you\u2019re a mom of an infant, or for whatever reason aren\u2019t getting as much sleep as you\u2019d like out having to wake up multiple times a night, this mattress on a platform bed is worth every penny. I just wish I had done it a long time ago.",
