                "reviewText": "I didn\u2019t want a thick mattress but was concerned I might feel the metal daybed support bars with only the 6\u201d. There was no need to worry. It\u2019s think enough and extremely comfortable. Firm enough that it doesn\u2019t sag but not too firm to be hard on joints. Very happy with the purchase. No odor (I know some of the mattress in a box have strange smells) and it expanded to its full shape evenly without any issues. I did wait the full time recommended in the directions.",
