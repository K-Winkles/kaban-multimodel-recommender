                "reviewText": "This Zinus mattress rocks! (Although maybe that's not the best description for a mattress?)It comes packaged in a surprisingly small box (but don't let the box size fool you -- it contains a full-sized mattress and so it's HEAVY). Just remove the box (I found that it's easier to remove the box from the mattress than to remove the mattress from the box) and *carefully* take the plastic liner off -- the mattress automatically starts to expand. In a few minutes, it's reached most of its final size -- full enlargement will take a few hours.I didn't notice any chemical odor, maybe because of the green tea infusion. As for the layer of \"cooling gel\", I've never used a foam mattress before, so I have nothing to compare it to. (Unlike some other mattresses, this mattress has a \"top\" and \"bottom\" -- don't mix them up!) But I can vouch for this mattress -- it's quite comfortable and I haven't noticed any problems with nighttime overheating whatsoever.The convenience of having a mattress delivered to my door can't be beat! Fortunately, my city provides pickup of large items (like mattresses), so getting rid of my old mattress wasn't a problem. If you don't have such a service, you need to think about how you're going to dispose of your old mattress.Of course, the comfort of a mattress is very subjective and will vary from one individual to another. I'm a 5'10\" 170 lb male and I find the medium-firmness / queen size very comfortable.Convenience and comfort at a reasonable price. I'm *very* happy with this Zinus memory-foam mattress! Highly recommended!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Just like the web pictures!",
                "reviewText": "This mattress is just like the web pictures show it once you have it unpacked and it gains its un-shrunk size back. It ships in a box that is 14 by 14 by 28 (just over 3 cubic feet) (and it is HEAVY!), and it expands to a twin size mattress of 75 by 39 by 8 (13.5 cubic feet), so an expansion to more than 4 times its shipping size. The lesson here? Once you expand it, you'll NEVER get it back in the box!Once expanded (allow about 24 hours, although it APPEARS done in just about 3 hours or so), it seems just as sturdy as any other spring-based mattress. I am still not sure if I like the memory-foam feature or not. But as a mattress in a spare room, especially with a twin mattress for kids, it appears to be okay. I am also not sure if I can tell any difference based on the COOLING gel principle. And I certainly have no CLUE what the Green Tea effect is on a mattress -- the thing is white, not green in any way!Lacking anything negative to say about this mattress, other than not being able to store it back in its box, I'm giving it 5 stars. When I lay on it, it DOES compress under my weight, but not suffocatingly so, and I am 210 pounds, and it says its weight limit is 250 pounds. So for a child's bed, especially one in our guest bedroom that will be only rarely used, it'll be a great lower-cost solution than a standard mattress of any quality (low-cost mattresses could be less costly, but I wouldn't want MY kid or grandkid to have to endure such a cheap mattress). This has higher quality without a higher price!",

                "reviewText": "This mattress was a pleasant surprise. It came fully compressed in a reasonably small box. It is heavy. Once unpacked the mattress began to regain its full size. It seemed to reach the full size over a few hours but I gave it a full 24 hours. I did not notice any chemical odors.I would say this mattress has a medium firmness. You do sink in a bit but also feel the support. Being an 8-inch mattress I feel this is better for occasional use or for lighter people. I don't know that it would hold its support if used every night by a heavier individual. We did add a 3-inch mattress topper to give the mattress some extra thickness and support.I am not clear on what green tea does, but I don't see how it could hurt. The addition of the gel-based foam should help the mattress dissipate heat better than just the regular foam would do. If you need a mattress for a spare bed or a child this mattress from Zinus is a solid choice.",

My husband and I are 220/155 lbs respectively, and we sleep so well on this mattress. Do make sure you give it a day or two to fully \"inflate\" inside and out before using it. I'm happy to share this with the other in-laws...we all FINALLY have a good mattress for when we go and stay with the kiddos!",
