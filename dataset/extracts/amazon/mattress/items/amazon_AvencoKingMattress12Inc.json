Not soft, not too hard, which is just right for me, especially for someone with a bad waist. This mattress is very friendly. When I sleep, my whole body sinks in and I feel like I am wrapped by the entire mattress, allowing me to have a good sleep. Although it is dented, it will bounce back quickly. I think the quality is very good. The only drawback is that the edge is not complete enough and not as flat as the brown mattress, but this is acceptable. After all, no product is perfect.",

One of our primary concerns was finding a mattress that offered firmness without sacrificing comfort. From the moment we laid down, it was evident that this mattress was different. Despite our initial skepticism, the foam construction provided an unparalleled level of support that surpassed our expectations.Additionally, we appreciate the absence of unnecessary pillow tops\u2014a feature that tends to compromise the integrity of many mattresses. With this mattress, what you see is what you get: pure comfort and uncompromising support.We are so happy with this purchase. If you're like us, in search of a mattress that delivers firmness without sacrificing comfort, look no further than a foam mattress. It's a decision you won't regret.",
