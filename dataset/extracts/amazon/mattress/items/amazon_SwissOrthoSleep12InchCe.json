                "reviewText": "My bedroom\u2019s ordinary size & my old mattress is still on the floor beside my bed, so I\u2019m not sure how well these pictures show. But a few things to say. I received this at 12:15-ish in the afternoon, this afternoon of writing. It\u2019s now nearing 3pm by a few minutes. A close friend of mine, set it up alone in about an hour, having to rest for long minutes at a time in between. I think the worst part is that it\u2019s a hugely heavy mattress. It sure is. Unmovable for anyone or ordinary or weak strength alone.It simply unraveled out of the over-outer plastic covering and then we cut off the inner layer plastic, all while it was on the steel platform bed. It began expanding as soon as it was out of the first outer plastic so we had to get it out immediately of the second binding to finish expanding.This full expansion was taken at just 1 hour & 20 minutes about but it basically had nearly full expansion after 3 minutes. Amazing! In an hour & 20 minutes though \u2014 I bought a 12\u201d very firm queen \u2014 it got a lot tougher in quality of fullness over the top. It is presently growing just over 10\u201d now. I have to double check though, I might have actually only bought the 10\u201d. I\u2019m not sure right now. It doesn\u2019t matter, it seems a fine height to me.The instructions say to leave it alone for 48 hours. I might leave it alone longer. I\u2019m looking forward to trying it during the coming week. It\u2019s a Friday afternoon now.As for odor, I\u2019ve finally had a chance to understand what possibly the awful stories are about in part. There are two medium sized desiccate packets born into the inner locked compression plastic binding the mattresses from unlocking. I had no odor throughout the unpacking, until we unlocked the final plastic and found the two desiccate packets. Then there was some typical odor like that \u2014 a chemical picking up the odors if whatever it\u2019s wrapped in. My friend doing the work didn\u2019t smell anything. I sprayed Febreze over it & it also made the Febreze smell like the desiccate, so that\u2019s definitely part of what\u2019s at work with all these odors. It\u2019s a shame, because different mattresses are made with different cloth closing materials & desiccate will give any clothe a chemical odor.But it\u2019s nothing really that needs to be noted except that I wanted to comment on what I\u2019d learned. Right now, the light, lingering faintness of it isn\u2019t going to last past my Febreze spray from an hour ago. Right at this moment anyone walking into my apartment would probably only notice Febreze.So I hope to update this next week after I\u2019ve slept on it, to find how it\u2019s comfort is \u2014 should turn out be an excellent firm it seems; very hard to find type besides. And also to relate what size I bought & how large it expanded after so many days of waiting.A year and a half later\u2026. The mattress has been excellently firm over the past time and never really caved anywhere significantly. It\u2019s still firm and very comfortable. This is with regular night to night use in that time. About now only I\u2019m starting to notice that where I sit sometimes propped up with my electronic device working, it\u2019s taking shape of a smaller less firm indent. Only slightly.",

                "reviewText": "Five years ago, I found myself needing a mattress urgently. I had moved out of an apartment with a built-in bed, so I had nothing to sleep on except for an old twin mattress made out of memory foam. It had a black hole in the middle that slowly leaked Hawking radiation.I had the Swiss Ortho delivered to my workplace, and I took it home in a 2003 Chevy Impala. I let the front seat down and slid the box in at an angle. A small part of it stuck out the passenger window.It opened up exactly as advertised. It was marketed as a mattress that you don't have to flip over, so I rotated it clockwise at regular intervals. It stayed firm and functional for some years.Last year, it was beginning to sink down in the middle, so I decided to finally flip it over before a bunch of astrophysicists showed up to study the gravitational collapse.Flipping it actually helped to make it more comfortable. The bottom of the mattress is of Completely Different material and texture, so it took a night or two to get used to.This approach probably won't work if you have a spouse sleeping next you, unless they're onboard with this attempt to keep the black hole's event horizon at bay for another year.The mattress discolors Very Easily, so I suggest you put a mattress pad between the mattress and your fitted sheet.It is recommended that you change your mattress every eight years anyway, so five good years out of this one has been just fine by me, especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy a bed in a box But the price was right and the reviews were pretty good. It was not too hard to remove from the box and wrapping. Its a 100# and large so not super easy to maneuver by yourself but I managed. Once I cut the vac seal it immediately started to open up I say to fully see the expansion it was a good 12 hrs it also firmed up a little from the initial time I slept on it which to me was better. The only thing that I do not like and it might not be able to be fixed since it's sealed in a box are the sides are not as supportive I think I can get used to that",
