                "reviewText": "This review is for the King 3.0 Quilted Mattress. For reference, my height is 5'7, and weight is 160lbs. I've slept on this bed for over a week now, and here is my non-biased review.1. Firmness - The Classic Brands website states this mattress as being a Medium feel. Based off my personal opinion, I would say it is more of a Medium Firm. However, as with any memory foam mattress, the colder the temperature, the more firm the bed will be, the hotter the temperature, the more soft it'll be. That being said, the temperature of my apartment during this last week has been on average between 70-75 degrees.2. Temperature of Bed - If you are a sleeper that tends to be warmer, I don't think I'd necessarily recommend this bed for you. It definitely sleeps on the hotter side and can get pretty toasty at times. To give another example, when I leave the bed to go to the bathroom and come back a few minutes later, the bed has retained all heat as if I never left. I also use a Goose Down Comforter for reference.3. Design - This bed is very heavy and I highly recommend you unpack it with two people. I personally did it by myself, however a helping hand would have been nice. It was also vacuum packed in a way that regardless of how you let it open, it needed to be flipped over. As soon as I got it into position and cut off the plastic, the bed sprung to life and full size within about 10-15 minutes. I also measured the height of the bed hours later and can say it got to the full 14\". I unrolled the bed at about 10am and never laid on it until about midnight, giving it 14 hours to breath. In my opinion, this was plenty of time for it to get to full size as it seemed good to go within 30 minutes. However, just in case, I didn't lay on it all day.4. Sleep Positions / Feel - I am a stomach and side sleeper when I'm actually wanting to go to sleep. However, prior to this, I'll always lay on my back and watch something on my phone before bed. I have found this bed to be comfortable in all positions, but specifically for the way I sleep on my stomach and side, it is very comfortable. I feel that it hugs the shape of my body very well in any position I'm in, providing plenty of support, yet also great cushion.5. Smell - I've read in other bed reviews in general that some beds have a bad chemical smell after unboxing. I can say that this bed has absolutely no weird or funky smells of any kind.6. Verdict - Would I buy this bed again? Definitely! I did hours upon hours of research and reviews on tons of beds and this ended up being my choice. A side from online reviews and research, I also went to multiple physical bed stores to figure out what specific bed type was best for me and my sleeping habits. I highly recommend everyone does this before your next bed purchase.Hopefully this answers any questions someone may have specific to the 3.0 Quilted Mattress.",

                "reviewText": "Style Name: 3.0 Quilted MattressSize: KingPrice: 658.99Current Price: 560.14I was very hesitant to buy a bed online sight unseen.It was difficult to read reviews on the bed as the different models are all mixed together in the listing. I was able to distinguish the reviews that listed the Style name in the heading and read the reviews specifically for the 3.0 Quilted Mattress. As with anything there were good reviews and some that were not so favorable. I decided to take the plunge and just buy the bed.I waited to give a review as I wanted to actually use the bed for a while to be able to give a good, honest review.I am so glad I did! I am a bit disappointed to see the price dropped $98.99 since I bought it, but the bed is so comfortable. Both I and my Fiance love this bed! I have sleep apnea and this bed seems to help tremendously. The only con I have with this bed is that I do not want to get out of it in the morning.Some of the negatives that I read in reviews before I bought the bed seem to be just personal preferences.* The odor from the mattress when you first unbox it does not last forever. Being that I wanted to sleep in it as soon as we received it, I did not wait to make the bed. I believe if you were able to leave the bed \"air out\" for as long as possible would help with the odor. Not a big deal though.* One customer complained the bed never expanded the full height. 14 inches. I did not have that problem. It expanded just fine. There are no sunken spots or issues with it in that aspect.* Another review complained the bed was too hot. I do not have this issue either. So comfortable.* Other reviewers complained the box the bed came in was badly damaged. Mine arrived with no damage to the box.* Also, reviewers were dissapointed that they feel as if they will slide off the side of the bed as the memory foam is not firm on the edge. The only time you will notice this is when you are sitting or getting in/out of the bed. What would you expect? It is foam. This is nothing you would notice when you are laying in the bed.* Some reviewers mentioned there was a needle sticking out of the bed and some stains on them. I did not have this issue. Condition was perfect!I really have nothing bad to say about this mattress. I am so happy with it! If you are thinking about buying the bed the current price of $560.14 is a very good deal.I am so glad we went with this mattress!!!",

                "reviewText": "I have had this mattress for almost a year and I still look forward to jumping on it every day. My husband whom is way over weight (I am average), loves it as well, unfortunately we had to switch sides every few months to allow the foam to breath and reaffirm itself. So far we have only done this twice. He does complain a bit the the sides are a bit softer than traditional mattresses, but I reminded him it foam, not wires and springs (which never lasted him). I may update next year if I remember to.",

                "reviewText": "I tried to like this bed, the first maybe inch, if that is a bit soft, but after that it is very hard. Advertised as super plush but definitely super firm. It seems nice when you first press on it, seems plush and soft. However once you lay down and distribute your weight, it is stiff as a board. The cooling gel doesn't seem to do anything, it gets pretty hot. My fiance won't even sleep on the mattress because it hurts her back so much. And man would it be a hassle to return, it's a king size mattress and ways a ton, and good luck getting it compressed again. Do your self a favor and by one the big name brands like nectar, Casper, or purple.",
