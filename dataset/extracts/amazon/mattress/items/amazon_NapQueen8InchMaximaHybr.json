Not my cup of tea but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to get then I would go with this bed. Comfy but overall not what I was hoping for",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the NapQueen 8 Inch Maxima Hybrid Mattress, and while it has some positive aspects, there are a few drawbacks that prevent me from giving it a higher rating.Let's start with the positives. The mattress arrived promptly and was relatively easy to set up. I appreciated the convenience of having it delivered directly to my doorstep in a compact box. The hybrid design, combining memory foam and innerspring coils, initially seemed promising in terms of both support and comfort.However, after sleeping on the mattress for a few weeks, I noticed some issues. While the mattress does provide adequate support for my back, I found it to be firmer than expected. As a side sleeper, I prefer a softer surface that conforms to the curves of my body, but I felt that this mattress lacked the plushness I was hoping for.Additionally, I experienced some motion transfer, which was surprising considering the hybrid construction. I could feel movement from my partner during the night, which occasionally disrupted my sleep. While it wasn't a dealbreaker, it was definitely a noticeable drawback.Another concern is the durability of the mattress. After only a few weeks of use, I noticed some indentations forming in the foam layer, particularly in areas where I tend to sleep. While this may be expected to some extent with memory foam mattresses, I was hoping for better longevity given the price point of the NapQueen mattress.Overall, the NapQueen 8 Inch Maxima Hybrid Mattress is a decent option for those seeking a budget-friendly mattress with hybrid construction. It provides adequate support and convenience, but the firmness level may not be suitable for everyone, and there are some durability concerns to consider. While it didn't quite meet my expectations, it may still be a suitable choice for others with different preferences.",

This fits him just fine, and he is working on 6 ft. and growing. The bed is surprisingly comfortable! Caution needs to be used when unpacking this tightly coiled mattress: Stand back when you release the Kraken! My sister stayed with us a couple of weeks and she reported that the mattress was extremely comfortable. So it meets approval with a 15 year old and a 70 year old. Winner winner!",

                "reviewText": "The NapQueen Twin-XL Mattress is a hybrid mattress that combines cooling gel-infused memory foam and innerspring for a medium feel. It\u2019s 8 inches thick and comes in a convenient bed-in-a-box packaging.Unfortunately, the mattress didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. While it\u2019s marketed as having a medium feel, I found it to be quite firm. This made it less comfortable than I had hoped, especially for side sleeping.The cooling gel-infused memory foam was also a bit of a letdown. It didn\u2019t seem to provide as much cooling as expected, which led to some uncomfortable, warm nights.In conclusion, the NapQueen Twin-XL Mattress didn\u2019t provide the comfort and cooling I was looking for. While it might be suitable for those who prefer a firmer mattress and don\u2019t sleep particularly hot, it wasn\u2019t the right fit for me. I\u2019m giving it 2 stars.",
