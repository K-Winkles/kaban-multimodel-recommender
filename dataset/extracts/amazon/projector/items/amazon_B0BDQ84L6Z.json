                "reviewText": "I tried couple of foreign budget brands after watching so many YouTube reviews but none of them impressed me.There is a reason why Epson,Benq .. etc are top brands. I liked the epson- co-w01 instantly.My observation:Anker solar 1080p projector: worst image quality I have ever seen. Videos are completely washed out- no colors, pale skin tones, no contrast, dull light. 300$Happrun: it\u2019s no. 1 selling on Amazon but I didn\u2019t like it at all. Edges are blurry, colors & contrast not good, not enough brightness. <90$Nexigo-pj40: edges are slightly blurry, colors over saturated, too much contrast that you can\u2019t watch hdr movies as anything in the shadow or black is completely black. I don\u2019t see faces of people in dark scenes. Not at all watchable. YouTubers gave rave reviews:( <250$***Epson: co-w01: 300$Pros:bright image even in eco modeSuper colorsGood contrast ( some reviews complained about contrast but compared to other products in this range it\u2019s good)Very low fan noiseReliable brandCons: you see some gray bars in top and bottom as this has slightly different aspect ratio but I\u2019m ok with itBulb life is less and not replaceable. But 12k hours life in eco is good for me.Just 1 hdmi and 1 usb port. No aux port.I\u2019m using fire tv stick with hdmi input and usb port to power the stick. Connected BT speaker to fire tv. All set to enjoy 100+ inches screen.",

The image wasn't super clear, and it was definitely hard to see it even with the faintest light on.I did a lot of research before deciding on this projector, mainly because I do not have a TV at home, and I wanted this to be a good purchase to be able to have movie nights, play videogames, watch TV, etc.I bought it on Prime Day, so it was very discounted, and it took 3 days to arrive, so it was super fast.The quality of the product's hardware is amazing, and I am extremely pleased with the sound and the image capacity it produces. We use it every day and have had no problems with it.",

                "reviewTitle": "Epson quality projection at a reasonable price with the CO-W01",
                "reviewText": "Having been forced to toss out a few lower-priced, but vastly inferior single-chip LCD projectors (with burn marks on the polarizer), I am so very impressed with this capable Epson-quality, ultra bright, long-lasting and flexible projector, I managed to grab a 28% off deal.I have stretched and stapled a screen over a 108\u201dx60\u201d frame built with 2\u201dx2\u201d wood, resulting in a wrinkle-free 124\u201d (10 foot) screen measured on the diagonal. With the ceiling installation of this Epson projector I have the equivalent of a 10-foot HD TV for roughly $550 all-in.Sure, it is at the low end of Epsons\u2019 offerings, but it creates a supersized, immersive big screen experience for streaming movies at home as well as for delivering sharp presentations in smaller office settings. The CO-W01 delivers an amazingly bright, sharp, crisp and clear image perception in vibrant, vivid colours, even with ambient light. It can achieve all this with up-to an impressive 300 inch display.The stated colour brightness of 3000 IDMS 15.4 lumens (equals roughly 3750 ANSI lumens ! ) has been notably verified by independent test results reported in reviews posted on-line. [According to the ISO 21118 standard, a single ANSI Lumen should equal 0.8 ISO Lumens]. An ideal lumen range for multi-purpose spaces is 2000 to 4000 ANSI lumens.For rooms with low ambient light you can select the \u2018ECO\u2019 Light Output setting (using a dedicated button on the remote) which slightly reduces brightness, providing a better contrast ratio for darker black-level performance, extends bulb-life, and also reduces power consumption and fan noise (from 38 dB to 29 dB, very noticeably quieter). A personalized selection from various Picture Modes can enhance the experience.In bright rooms, and for larger screen sizes, the \u2018High\u2019 Light Output setting bumps brightness up to the maximum when you need need a higher brightness to deliver quality images that are significantly less washed-out by excessive ambient light.To protect the bulb, the projector slowly warms up for 30 seconds or so before reaching maximum brightness. Lamp-hours-used under each Light Output mode can be displayed in the Info Menu.The advanced 3-chip 3LCD technology (one chip for each primary color: red, green and blue) displays 100% of the RGB colour signal for every frame. This provides outstanding and realistic colour accuracy, up to 16.77 billion colours, and better performance by providing colour with up to three-times the illuminance over a single-chip LCD projector at equal lumens level. The projected image is crisp and bright, even at the corners.Of course, a menu \u2018Projection\u2019 option can flip the picture for ceiling mounting. A manual keystone correction can properly adjust otherwise skewed or crooked image proportions, when projected at an angle, (as much as 30 degrees for this projector). I was pleasantly surprised that the ceiling-mounted projector reacts to commands from the remote even from directly beneath it.There is a manual focus lever and menu-selected digital zoom (optical zoom not available). Menu options permit adjustments to aspect ratio and colour mode. Picture Shift is a handy feature to help centre the image on a screen.While the resolution of the projector may seem odd, and to lean into the Epson forte for office presentations from computers, rest assured it is indeed high-definition (HDTV) quality and Epsons\u2019 SizeWise chip ensures support for other display resolutions (up to and including Full HD 1080p (1020 x 1080) video via HDMI). The aspect ratio is 16:10, with a native WXGA resolution of 1200 x 800 Pixels or 1,024,000 dots (roughly the 720p (1280 x 720) being broadcast by many TV stations). It is not 4K compatible.The CO-W01 had a long lamp life of up to 6,000 hours ( 12,000 hours in ECO mode, equivalent to nearly 7 years of viewing at 5 hours per day). It is a great value for the money, especially when compared to the relatively short life of lower quality single-chip LCD projectors often reported (in 1-star reviews) as susceptible to projecting anomalous images, resulting from burn marks on the polarizer (progressing from yellow/orange, through brown, to black) after a just few months of use.Directly connect an HDMI cable from, a laptop, cable/satellite box, DVD player, gaming console, or your preferred streaming device. I have an \u2018HDMI switch\u2019 that easily enables alternating between Fire Stick or satellite receiver.Unfortunately, the 5 watt built-in speaker is not very impressive. Strangely, there is no 3.5mm jack for sound output, but this deficiency can easily be overcome by inserting an inexpensive \u2018HDMI Audio Extractor\u2019 in the HDMI cable linkage to provide the \u20183.5mm jack\u2019 needed to run a separate cable from the Audio Out port of the Extractor to a sound system input.The USB Type-A port permits connection of USB thumb drives, or the USB power cable from a Fire Stick (providing sufficient 5v, 2A). Sadly, the projectors\u2019 USB file support is very-limited to; .jpg , .bmp , .gif , .png , and .avi (720p and < 2 gb).",
