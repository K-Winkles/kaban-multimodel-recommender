                "reviewText": "This is a very large sturdy projector. If you want to install it in your ceiling then get a pro to do it cause this thing is a monster weighing in at 24 pounds and 20 inches wide. I opted to get a tall thin metal table to prop it up on instead. The size and weight give the impression that this monster machine will last a lifetime. I expect that it will. It is pretty easy to install with the Quick Setup instructions included. Make sure all your equipment is 4k compatible and you're good to go. The image is outstanding. There are so many options for customizing the image too. The colors are vivid. Blacks are not as smooth as I'd like but still better than 1080p. I'm confident that if I fiddle with the menu some more I can get the blacks smoother though. This monster is so much better than my other 1080p projector which looks tiny sitting next to it. It is also much quieter than my smaller projector. You can barely hear it. This projector will enhance your source to 4K resolution. I haven't tried regular DVDs on it yet but I have used Blu-rays and it really enhances blu-ray images to their utmost clarity and detail. You can almost see the pores on the skin of the actors onscreen. You'll have to play with the settings a little bit to get it to work exactly how you want it and the lens shifting took a little getting used to. Image resolution setting changes automatically depending on the content. Simply put, if you want a 4K image then use a 4K disk in a 4K player connected to this kind of 4K projector. But a regular Blu-ray Disc looks really awesome on it too.",

Granted, we are coming from a 32in 720p TV, but everything about the image has blown us away. Super impressive. Wish it could be a touch brighter, but splitting hairs - the lumens are clearly stated.We're also very pleased with the motorized lens shift - it's substantial and allows us to place the projector in an atypical but useful place in our room.Also very pleased with the quality of the build, the features as outlined in the manual/software (go check it out before you buy online), and the customer service. We received the wrong remote control, and after calling Epson (got a person in <1 min) and talking through it, they overnighted me the correct remote, which works perfectly. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a step up from my JVC DLA-x590r in my opinion. The reason iam comparing the two projectors is because they both are very similar in many ways. Both are huge projectors, with the Epsom 4010 being much wider. The JVC is 10 lbs heavier @34 lbs and deeper. The Epson has some new cool features that the JVC doesn't have. The Epson and the JVC are both pixel shifting 1080p projectors even though they both are using 2 slightly different technologies LCD vs LCOS which JVC calls DILA. I prefer the Epson over the JVC because the Epson is much brighter @ 2400 lms and the colors look more vibrant. Even though the JVC has better black levels and has two 18gbs HDMI ports. The Epson 4010 does HDR better as well because of its new and improve optic engine. The Epson menu system is easy to use and has 10 preset lens memory settings to accommodate an ultra wide cinema scope screen with out the expensive anamorphic wide angle lens kit as you can see from the pictures. This projector is perfect for those home theater enthusiast, or for those who will be putting it in a living room/media room setup. I found placement of this projector to be very easy because I custom built a shelf in the back of my home theater room (no need for a projector mount). It was also very easy to align the picture perfectly to fit my screen. Its interesting to note that The projector does not play the full 4k HDR @60hz ,only 4k HDR @30hz. Its not really a big deal to me but I notice when I was setting up my Roku ultra box display settings it would not accept the 4k HDR @60hz, so it dropped to 4kHDR @30hz (which still looks great by the way). I would also recommend to those who are really serious about their picture quality to have the projector calibrated correctly to get the best 4k HDR picture. I think this projector is worth every penny for what you get compared to similar brands around the same price.",

                "reviewText": "It's huge! Other reviews weren't kidding. Pictured is my old epson 3020 which I thought was big until this thing arrived. That said, who cares if it's big if mounting on your ceiling in home theater room like most of us.Pros:-Mechanical Lens Correction - wow this was so cool and so much easier to get the picture centered/sized on your screen.-Mechanical Lens cap when you power down! so cool!-Colors are pretty good.-Black levels are not drowned out. Thank goodness!-Controller. (really not much changed in the past 7 years there)-Quiet when on any mode but Dynamic (unfortunately you'll want it on dynamic)Cons-LOUD fan on Dynamic mode which is how I like it and has the best picture.-Same darn menu as my 3020 from like 7 years ago. It's fine but whatever.-NO AUDIO OUT! c'mon. Which means instead of plugging your streaming stick directly into the epson, then running your audio to your receiver...you have to .....plug your streaming stick into the receiver, then run your long HDMI to the projector. Not ideal. But not a deal breaker. Knew this going in though.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Optima hd27 which was full hd digital dlp projector. The picture that you get from the Epson is so much better. I have not sat down and actually watched a 4k movie yet though. The text on screens from menus on disney +, netflix, and fire stick are so clear. I have watched some hd content online but streaming services are so horrid till they buffer. Other than that we have watched a few blu ray movies and those were very clear as well. I have a 120\" screen in a basement so it's sort of cheating when it comes to brightness. With that stated it is a very bright screen as well and the colors are not overly warm. It has a very natural color to it and I didn't have to do any color correction. So far I have no complaints but have some concerns about long term reliability based on other reviews.",
