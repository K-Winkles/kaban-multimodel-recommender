                "reviewText": "I love this projector! The quality, size and option to have an optional stand (that collapses to act as a pole). The clarity is great and so is the sound. I bought it to use it outdoors, but can think of many ways to use it indoors (not all of our rooms have tvs so this will be perfect for guests! We bought this to project onto the house or garage for the holidays. My trouble is avoiding the \"subscriptions\" that cost more money. I can't figure out a way to play the download without having to subscribe to a monthly app. I need to spend time trying to figure out this part, because it's a deal breaker if I can't project without having a monthly subscription. I think the manual needs a bit more detail for those of us who don't get along well with technology. Maybe even a video!",

The only thing that can be changed is the focus and size of the image. The sound is very weak... my old Sony Ericsson sounds 5 times better than this projector. About \u201c4k support\u201d\u2026 maybe in somebody dreams it\u2019s support 4k, but I made sure that it does not support 4k video. So this projector is just a waste of money and time",

Sometimes the projector do not project so it need to be unplug from the electricity and then replug and it worked.So se little point that are annoying but in general it is a good product worth what I paid.Maybe latter system update will solve the bugs.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a projector that had the apps already installed and had a good speaker. This one definitely satisfies in those departments. I added a fire stick 4k to make things even better. I've had it for over three months now and have used it in two rooms so it has lasted a good amount of time. The only two things that are a bit annoying are the extra steps to get to the HDMI and that it doesn't have something to adjust the leveling of the device itself. It comes with a tripod but it isn't very adjustable. I just propped it up with a little leverage of a book. Overall though, great value for what you get. Would buy again.",
