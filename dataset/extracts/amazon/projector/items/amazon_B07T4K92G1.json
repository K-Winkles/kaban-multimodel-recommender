                "reviewText": "Are you looking for a cheap projector that will provide you with a decent viewing experience? Especially something where if it were to break, you're not out an arm and a leg? This is a fantastic option for exactly that!We ordered two projectors, this one, and another new projector that is under $100. We wanted to be able to test the differences between them, but also to have one permanently installed, while one we could take with us to various settings. Set up side by side, we were able to test a couple of different things, and this is what we found:-This projector was not quite as bright as the other projector it was tested against. However, it was still plenty bright and was able to be clearly seen, even in a room that had normal blinds drawn during the middle of the day, so plenty of ambient light that could make it difficult to see.-The image quality was okay, good enough for most casual viewing. It is a native 480p projector, so while it can upscale to 720p, it will be limited somewhat. Colors within the images were fine, though I wouldn't necessarily say great.-This projector had decent volume, but sound quality is not the best. It will certainly do the job when watching a tv show, but if you want more richness in the sound quality, you'll want to look at some extra speakers.-Decent amount of adjustability! The projector we compared this to did not come with any ability to zoom or do any keystone corrections, so when this one allowed us to use different angles for projection, it definitely was a win. I did notice though that the edges of the images could be a little fuzzy even when the center of the screen was focused correctly.-Lastly, the fan certainly isn't the quietest. It's not loud enough to completely take away from whatever you are watching, so long as your volume is high enough. However, if you do listen for it, it'll still be noticeable, probably more so the closer to the actual projector you are.Long story short? Really can't go wrong with this projector at this price point. Definitely not going to be the best viewing experience you've ever had. But being able to get a big screen picture at this price? Definitely worth it. For the price per performance ratio, I'm giving this five stars.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Was honestly a bit skeptical of this projector. Considering the old saying \"you get what you pay for.\" Well, I got more than I paid for. This is a cheap, yet nice projector. Works okay in somewhat light rooms. But really looks good in a dark room. It's light, easy to travel with. Has a remote control. Has a good ount of inputs for whatever you wanna play on it. The projector has a built in speaker. Is the speaker the best? No, no it isn't. However..it is decent. Especially for the price! I've hooked up my Blu ray player, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X to it. And have even used it for a job! As an artist, I sometimes look for a way to easily do big jobs. I've been doing art for a barbershop in town. And decided to put the draft drawing onto an SD card. Then prohect it onto the wall. To ensure the lettering etc..is how I want it to be in size etc..Worked really well. I recommend this projector if you want a good one for a cheap price! And RCA is a well known, historic brand!",

The projector needs to be \"close\" to the wall to have a clear picture. Not many option to focus the picture. One knob is to focus. The other is for the skew (not what it is called but it changes the rectangle image shape).On the other hand, I love that it was two HDMI inputs (which is why I bought it in the first place). The speaker isn't that great so I'm happy it has an audio output jack which I can connect to an external speaker. It worked good enough for us to watch Hamilton and a movie.As mentioned before, I am still working perfecting the projected image but as of now, it's either blurry on top and clear on lower. or clear on top and blurry on bottom. It might be how I have the projector positioned.",
