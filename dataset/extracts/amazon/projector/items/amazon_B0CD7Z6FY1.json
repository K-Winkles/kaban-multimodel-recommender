The picture quality is great. The colors are vibrant and the image is sharp. The projector is also very easy to set up and use.The only downside is that you can't have the projector in the vertical position with an HDMI cable. This can be a bit tedious, but there are other ways to connect the projector, so it's not a deal breaker.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. It's a great value for the price, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mini projector.**Pros:*** Great picture quality* Easy to set up and use* Affordable price**Cons:*** Can't have the projector in the vertical position with an HDMI cable* Sound quality could be better**Overall rating:** 4.5 out of 5 stars",

Even tried connecting the projector by USB connectivity and still will not connect. It should not be this difficult to connect via Bluetooth , miracast, iOScast or USB. The device will not even pull up and both devices needed to connect are in the same room so there\u2019s not any interference. I will be returning this piece of crap as soon as possible.",

Yes, you need to use it in a dimly lit room, but it works well. My favorite set-up is to use the projector on a large wall, while directing the audio to a sound bar. This method gives a small theatre-like experience.",

Connects to my computer with an HDMI and my phone and tablet via Bluetooth. Occasionally the Bluetooth lags with the audio for 2-3 sec. But we don\u2019t mind it. Sometimes we project onto our ceiling for a different experience but we can only do that with Bluetooth. Our HDMI cable gets in the way otherwise and we are not able to turn the projector perpendicular to the floor. Will try to use this projector for as long as we can. Have had it for 3 months now and still working great.",
