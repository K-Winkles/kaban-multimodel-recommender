Plus, its portability has allowed me to set up movie nights in the backyard effortlessly. However, I did find myself wishing for a bit more brightness in some settings.",

Lo recomiendo de verdad por precio y calidad, espero me dure unos a\u00f1os, la calidad de imagen es muy buena obvio en la oscuridad, y lo mejor es que tiene Youtube Y Netflix integrado y a su ves, puedes descargar otros programas. Lo coloque en una pared de 5 metros de ancho y se pierde ligeramente la calidad de la imagen pero no es mucho, parece que estas en el cine, el unico punto malo es que suena mucho el ventilador pero si conectas unas bocinas de alta calidad se pierde el sonido. Les dejo una prueba de video de aprox 2 mts de ancho de pantalla. LO AME.",
