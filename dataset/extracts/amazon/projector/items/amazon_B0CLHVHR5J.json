                "reviewText": "I have tried about six projectors of varying prices and designs, and this is the one that I decided to keep. Overall I like the projector for my needs: I use it in a smaller bedroom to watch TV and I take it places to project on walls.Pros:Low costSmall and lightSelf-contained standAdjustable angle stand (but cannot adjust all the way to vertical if HDMI connected)Easy to setupAuto and manual keystone correctionElectronic Zoom in and out (many projectors do not have this feature)Fan noise sounds more like a noise machine than a high-pitched or distracting fan.Cons:Not super bright; works best in a darker roomLower picture quality than others (but still decent when dark and set up properly)Slight light around the edges of picture when you zoom in (but not that noticeable)Sound is weak, but okay for most showsAngle adjustment is not free, it locks into certain angles, which can make it more difficult to position the image precisely where you want itAll control goes through remote, so if that breaks, I guess I'm out of luck (I plan to try to buy a backup)",

                "reviewText": "This product has been nothing short of a complete disaster, and I can't help but share my intense dissatisfaction with you.Here are some of the infuriating issues I've encountered:Upon turning it on, the projector stubbornly displays only the \"Miracast\" setup page, effectively locking me out of accessing any other features or the home screen. It's as if the projector has become a one-trick pony.Bluetooth pairing with my phone appears to work, but it's utterly pointless since it fails to deliver any functionality. Moreover, attempting to use it with HDMI out on my PC is an exercise in frustration. The placement of the HDMI port on the back is a design flaw that hinders vertical rotation with an HDMI connector, making it incredibly inconvenient.Despite numerous attempts to adjust the settings, the image quality remains consistently and infuriatingly blurry, undermining the very purpose of a projector.To add insult to injury, my initial purchase was a colossal waste of money and time. The product arrived broken, a testament to the utter lack of quality control. It's maddening that this fraudulent company would knowingly send out defective items. The projector doesn't connect to any smart devices or Wi-Fi as advertised, and the screen quality is nothing short of abysmal.",

M\u00e1 vontade do entregador que deixou o pacote em um pr\u00e9dio diferente do meu. N\u00famero completamente diferente, n\u00e3o da pra dizer que foi um simples erro, entregador n\u00e3o estava afim de entregar e deixou em qualquer lugar. Felizmente a portaria deles percebeu e entrou contato comigo que fui buscar, se n\u00e3o fosse isso eu ficaria sem o produto. Correios brasileiros como sempre p\u00e9ssimos.Mas o produto em si \u00e9 excelente, \u00f3timo custo benef\u00edcio, o som n\u00e3o \u00e9 alto mas levando em considera\u00e7\u00e3o o pre\u00e7o e a proposta do projetor da pra entender. Conectei com uma caixa de som jbl e agora tenho um cinema em casa. A qualidade de imagem surpreende, n\u00e3o tive problemas com conex\u00e3o de internet ou bluetooth. Recomendo 200% o produto e o vendedor. Fui taxado, mas reembolsado, \u00f3timo atendimento.",
