                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Projector at this price point",
                "reviewText": "This is my first time purchasing a projector, but I have experience with buying other high-res TVs and computer monitors in the past. I think for the price point ($1499.99 at the time of writing this review), this projector is well worth the money.For the past week, I have been testing out the capabilities of the projector on 4k movies and games (native and streamed). I thought that the colors on the unit out of the box were superb, similar to what you would find on an IPS computer monitor that has been properly calibrated. BenQ even includes a color calibration report in the box. The sound coming from the 2 5W speakers on the projector is respectable for what they are. They won't get very loud but the quality is definitely good enough for a small outdoor venue or room. I would recommend separate speakers to pair with this projector overall, though. In comparison to the ViewSonic PX-747 4K projector ($899 at the time of writing this), which I initially purchased along with this projector to see which I preferred, you will definitely benefit a lot from sticking with the BenQ. While the sharpness of the two projectors for 1080p and 4K content does not differ vastly, the contrast on the BenQ makes a world of difference. When watching darker scenes in Stranger Things and playing darker levels in Gears of War 4 on Xbox One S it was very hard to make out the finer details and certain objects in frame on the ViewSonic. I tried to adjust the brightness and contrast to fix this but colors ended up just looking too washed out. On the BenQ, however, I immediately noticed an improvement in contrast and HDR quality and had no issues with these darker scenarios. Moreover, the BenQ was much faster when powering on or switching inputs, which doesn't sound like a huge factor but definitely helps if you use it a lot. The $600 jump between projectors, if you have the money for it, is definitely worth it if you want to have a projector that you'll be happy with for long term.I will say that if you are expecting this projector to be \"movie theater quality\" then you may be slightly disappointed, however. The overall dynamic range is still not as good as a 4K TV at a similar price point, the projector is not bright enough for a well lit room, and the sharpness could be a little better. For something with improvements to those qualities, you'll have to upgrade even further to a better BenQ, Epson, Sony, etc projector that has native 4K. I think for most people you'd be better off spending that money on a good projector screen, projector ceiling mount, speakers, AV receiver, HDMI 2.0 HDCP 2.2 cables, 4K Bluray movies, etc to accompany this projector. You'll get rapidly diminishing returns upgrading to more expensive projectors, while this projector definitely hits the sweet spot in value (at it's very portable weighing only 9 lbs). I'd definitely recommend it!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing picture quality....My first projector!",
                "reviewText": "This is my first projector and after looking at all of the different options, I figured this was the one to go with. It's been said that this projector resolved lot of the first generation projector problems so not having to deal with some of those quirks is always a positive. In any case, this projector was MUCH better than I had expected. I'm just projecting on a wall and it looked so good that I'm debating to whether to even a buy screen for it or not! Eventually i'll get the screen but it's not by any means an urgent need for me. I honestly can't tell whether i'm watching a TV or projector. Of course the room does need to be dark (some light is still acceptable) but if you have good amount of ambient light then the picture will look washed out.Things i don't like:1) Optical output is only outputting stereo sound. Not sure WTF BenQ was thinking here. I ended up buying a new receiver due to this. This was major let down for me and almost wanted to return this projector. But my old receiver was in need of update anyways so decided to fork the extra money for a new receiver.2) Fan noise (when I had it on a table this was a bit loud but ever since mounting it on a wall, I've noticed that it's quieter than before).3) Mounting - For some stupid reason, BenQ decided to not have a flat surface for the mount side so one of the screws is right next to the raised body. You can probably see it in the pics. In the end it still worked fine but for a company who's in this business for a while would have given some thought about this and made sure that the mounting side is completely flat. I used the Mount-It mount as it allowed for extension to drop the projector height.Things I LOVE:1) Picture quality - Hands down just amazing out of the box and I've only just watched 1080p content so far! Planning to connect 4k firestick this weekend to get an idea of how great this projector really is.2) Has USB power port (2.5A at that) so that I can just power the firestick off that port. Works perfectly!I really haven't played around with the different settings on the projector and frankly i'm afraid to just because it's puts out damn good image right now. Make sure to measure the distance from the lens to the wall and also the height of the projector. I think BenQ has a good calculator for this but again difficult to use. However, the best way is to just use a ladder and put the projector on it to see how the image would look. I just zoomed out the image completely and made sure that I was satisfied with the minimum image size it projected. After that I just found a good mounting spot for the projector mount between 1 to 2 feet after that spot so that I can then zoom in to get image size I wanted on the wall. I'd say go for it if you're debating to whether to get this as your first projector or not. I don't think I'd ever consider buying large TVs if a projector in that setting could also work.",

                "reviewText": "Loved the quality of the 4k image, displays streaming video beautifully. And not too big and heavy to take with you on vacay either, as long as you take along some inexpensive powered speakers. The onboard speaker is fine, but not as good as a pair of external stereo boxes.After 11 months, our HT3550 developed a dead pixel (sure sign of a DMD-chip failure--see picture). As the projector has a 3-year warranty, we called BenQ and spoke to a support representative who emailed us a return label. We shipped it back to CA.Even during the December/January holiday season, it was about three weeks total we waited for the repair. Our projector was returned with repairs made, and is now again hanging from our ceiling.It's working as well as it did when new.Great product, great service.Thanks, BenQ!",

The image sharpness is great, the projector is plenty bright enough for a dedicated home theatre room and most of all the fan noise on Eco mode is much quieter than my old BenQ W1070.very happy with this purchase",

I used the same support as I had for the W1070 and installed the projector at the exact same spot on the ceiling. It took less than 15 minutes to have it up and running and all setup done.I am very impressed by the image... it is a lot brighter and sharper than the W1070, even with non-4K sources. Also it is noticeably less noisy, especially in the Eco mode which I use.Extremely happy so far!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because it seemed like there were alot of positive reviews and the price point was really appealing compared to the others out there.Typically I find 1 star reviews are often outliers in the bunch and maybe my situation is also like that, but they sent me 2 faulty units so its tough to side with them.The first one showed up and as soon as I turned it on there were white stripes down half of the image that would not go away. I started the return process only to find out they don't replace the unit. They only refund, so I had to buy a new unit and return the faulty one.The current (new) unit I have also has image issues and randomly turns off and doesn't register the hdmi input on occasion. It would be less annoying if it were an obvious and easily to produce issue, but this time is random so I'm unsure of I should replace this one too..I hesitate to say its BenQ and not just this seller because when the picture does work it looks fantastic. But otherwise this thing is a glitchy mess out of the box. I will see about going to BenQ directly and see what they say.UPDATE: absolutely f&%* this company that sent me these. Both completely useless and defective units. I'm just glad it was able to completely crap out on me while I'm still eligible to return your garbage to you.",
