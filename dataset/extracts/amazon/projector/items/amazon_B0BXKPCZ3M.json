                "reviewText": "I needed to replace my compact projector that I purchased a few years back. First impressions of the FUDONI projector was well built (and well protected during shipping). It was a bit larger than my 'pocket projector' I had earlier, but the FUDONI projector sure packs a punch! I won't compare to my prior projector anymore, as there really isn't a comparison... The old projector needed a pitch black room to see the picture, whereas with the FUDONI projector can be used almost anywhere/anytime.Size - The FUDONI projector is about the size of my hand and has the weight of a well built device without being too heavy. All the cables are included in the shipping box, which I would recommend as a storage and transportation box as needed. I tripod connector is on the bottom of the device which will come into use when using at a portable location.Initial setup - this was about as simple as it gets! Plugged in the device, projected onto a bare wall, and the home screen provides quick access to several inputs (HDMI, VGA, USB, Bluetooth, and Screen Mirroring). I started with screen mirroring to my iPhone. Connecting to my home wireless network took about 15 seconds, and then I was able to mirror directly to the device. I was streaming to the projector less than one minute after unboxing!Quality of picture and sound - I was shocked at the quality of both the picture and sound of the FUDONI projector! As mentioned earlier, the brightness (or lumens) output by this projector allows viewing during the day in a normal room in the house - dark basement room isn't needed! This is a huge benefit from lower brightness projectors. The sound from the internal speakers also shocked me. I was sitting 20 feet away from the projector and the sound was perfect. I tested with an external speaker as well, and to be honest, the internal speaker sounded better - more 'stereo' than my external speaker. Out of the box, both the picture and sound were great, but within the settings menu, there are more settings if you wish to customize.Other features - Sleep Mode - this is great, especially with the kids always leaving things on. Having a sleep mode will help conserve power and the life of the projector when it's not in use. Lens Cover - while seems basic, this lens cover is well manufactured and will protect the lens from dirt and scratches. Remote - since I was able to control everything from my iPhone, I haven't used the remote yet, but I am certain it will come into use in the future. Screen - I have a screen that I built earlier, so didn't review the included screen, but will be a great benefit to some - especially those with dark walls.Final takeaway - With all the choices of projectors available today, this FUDONI projector packs a bunch of power in a compact size. The picture and sound are on par with industrual projectors costing thousands of dollars. I would highly recommend this projector to anyone in the market!",

                "reviewText": "This 1080p projector is an affordable, high-quality projector that delivers detailed, high-quality images and video, especially at night. The menus are very simple and easy to navigate. It is also very easy and quick to use, allowing you to view from the wall, ceiling, or projector screen (one 100\" screen included in the package) anytime and anywhere. I connected my Roku stick via the HDMI port was able to watch a movie on Netflix in minutes, perfect. Bluetooth function to external speakers and WiFi connection to my iPhone, iPad, and laptop is also a plus. The projector is not only great for viewing, but also for presentations, as the images really stand out, especially in dimly lit rooms. Not to mention the stereo sound. It's exactly what I was looking for, a powerful portable projector that I can use indoors and in my garden. Great product and great value for money!",

Went with this because it felt safe, and so far it is (albeit still a little pricey for my liking based on results).Sets up easily, relatively quiet. I suggest a Bluetooth speaker for the best experience (both for video and gaming).Sleight issues with sensitivity on picture quality. Will adjust multiple times. Mine has a very feint white line running vertically. I have since forgotten about it, but guests notice it regardless of what streams.Currently elevated 5 feet off the ground. In the image, the wall is 7 1/2 feet tall. Size can adjust great depending on usage.",
