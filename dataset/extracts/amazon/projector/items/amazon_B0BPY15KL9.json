                "reviewText": "This is honestly such a great projector for the price. I wanted an inexpensive projector to use with my blow-up outdoor movie screen, and to use in my cigar room when the weather outside isn't as good. With the Anker battery pack, blow-up screen, and portable speakers I can literally set this up anywhere in 5 minutes and have an outdoor theater. I'd also like to give a shout-out to their customer service, who was incredibly responsive and helpful. The cooling fan inside got a bit off-balance and would often make a loud noise, and they immediately sent me another one, then just had me ship the original one back in the box (I didn't have to ship mine in first and be without it). They followed up, they made sure I was happy, I'm very happy with them. Now, for the pros and cons:Pros:This is lightweight, but still solidly built. It doesn't feel cheap. The auto-focus and auto-keystone both work really well (although the lights really need to be off before you turn it on or it won't work as well). If you need to, though, you can easily and accurately focus it with the remote. It can rear-project (which I do with the outdoor blow-up screen), front-project, and project upside-down (to mount on the ceiling). It is partially a \"smart\" device, although they don't pay the licensing fees to the major networks so you'll still need something like a Fire Stick. The picture quality is very good, especially for this price. It has a USB port on it in order to power a device (like my Fire Stick).Cons:Honestly, at this price point anything I mention here is nitpicking a bit . . . but still things you would want to know before you buy. While you *can* connect it to Bluetooth speakers, if you are using it with a Fire Stick or something else plugged into HDMI, the lag is pretty annoying. This isn't really the fault of the projector, but something to plan for. I just connected my Fire Stick to the Bluetooth speakers directly, which works well. The interface on it is a little kludgy, but I only use it to reverse the image or select the input so it works fine for me.I honestly can't find anything else to fault it with. Could it be brighter? Sure, but not at this price point. In my patio with a streetlight nearby, rear projecting a 16ft image is a little on the dark side but a 10ft image in a dark room is perfect. I'm reasonably sure that a 16ft front-projected image in a dark room would be great.If I was the engineer I'd add 2 things. I would make the screw that comes out of the bottom to tilt it be designed to be a lot longer (or telescopic), the keystone limit is way above the limit of the screw. Not a big deal at all, I just put a small block under it. The second would be a video delay so that you could match the sound after going through both HDMI and Bluetooth. But neither of those things are necessary, just thoughts for future versions.To wrap up this book I've now written, if you want a basic projector for a great price with a decent warranty and great quality . . . I'd buy this one hands-down. If you have the money for a brighter 4K fully-smart device, then you aren't looking at this one. Since I move this a lot and even travel with it, I didn't want to spend a fortune on it and I couldn't be happier with it.",

                "reviewText": "My initial order arrived with issues so I had to do a return/replace*. Upon inspection of the first device, the lense was smudged and there was a weird auditory popping noise that would come from the projector every 5 minutes or so.After returning the first device, it's been smooth sailing since receiving my replacement. The projector works really great in a small dimly lit living room. I saw some people say you need absolute darkness, but honestly it's not that bad even during the day time.My favorite feature of this projector would have to be the auto focus and manual focus functions. I haven't had any issues at all getting the projection to focus and look sharp on my screen. Overall I think they really nailed the auto-sizing and focus settings.In summary, if you are looking for a 1080p budget projector that is capable of scaling to 4k, look no further. For reference, I also own a very high end Sony 4k projector. The obvious differences are the HDR depth, brightness, clarity, and pixels. But for the price point you are paying for the Ultimea, I think this is a great deal overall.",

                "reviewText": "Update 12.16.23 : So after seeing my original review below the seller reached out to me to address my concerns with the zoom functions that are only accessible after disabling multidirectional auto correction and getting the projector firmware updated to properly support HDR10. Long story short, this projector is now working like a charm after the update and I have now given this a 5 star review as the seller took the initiative to address my concerns after the initial setup. Thank you for the quick response and making this right! I will leave the original review below in case any of you run into the same issues that I did.Original 3 star Review:This is being advertised as HDR10 and 4k but it does not support HDR10. It does display 4k with no issue but not actually supporting HDR10 as advised is false advertising. It also lacks the basic zoom function that normally comes with most projectors. The image quality is ok but can stand to be a tad bit brighter for rooms that are not dark. It works great for darker rooms but it starts to wash out in brighter rooms. Will only be able to give it 3 stars as a result of not being HDR10 supporting as advised and missing the zoom option that is standard for any projector.",

I bought a $50 screen because I was looking for a cheap way to watch movies in bed, but I\u2019m actually sending it back because it has a gray tint for poor projection conditions and the contrast is so nice (at this price point) on this thing that it looks better on my light yellow wall than it does on the gray screen. It deserves a much better white screen so now I have to go figure out which one of those to get.The fan is very quiet (totally inaudible with a movie even at medium volume) and the built in speaker is very surprisingly good! I haven\u2019t even made the effort to connect it to my real speakers because the sound is perfect for casual bedroom watching.I wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to buy this again or recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap solution.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my first projector and I am extremely happy with it. The image quality is great, and so is the audio.It\u2019s easy to set up. Just place, plug in, connect hdmi device and play. My Xbox One games work fine but there\u2019s a delay and bit of a lag with my Xbox series X games so I don\u2019t recommend it for next generation consoles. Nintendo switch games work fine as well.Auto focus and auto keystone correction work great and make life easier. Little needs to be done with placing or correcting the image once projected. The option to manually zoom and adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc. is also available.I\u2019m casting the image at about 120 inches on a teal coloured wall about 13 feet away and I am pleased with the image colour and quality. Naturally it looks better/more enhanced in a dark room but it\u2019s still watchable in a lit up room. I can only imagine how much brighter and more defined the image would be with a quality projector screen or at least some HD projector wall paint.Audio from the projector speakers are impressive and will suffice if you don\u2019t have an audio system or external speakers, but I always recommend a set of decent speakers to add to the experience.I didn\u2019t notice much (if any) difference in picture quality while streaming netflix in 1080P on my Xbox One compared to streaming in 2160 on my Xbox series X. I even played a 4K disc and there was still no noticeable difference between that and the 1080P display.In the end, I\u2019m giving this product 5 stars for exceeding my expectation and for being listed at such a great price. If you\u2019re looking for your first good quality budget projector, for casual or home theatre use, this product will not disappoint.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this projector as used/refurbished for \u00a3200. So it's hard to compare as it's far better than other \u00a3200 projectors and I haven't tried others at the standard price. I'm not using a screen, just projected straight onto an off white/cream wall.The picture quality is very good, sharp, with good colour contrast. At times, when the video is very bright it reflects off the wall and causes the room to brighten, making the image wash out as if there's a light on. But this is down to how I have it set up, so I'm not taking any points away, just an FYI if you plan on using this without a screen/bright coloured room.The unit itself is very quiet. I'm sat less than a meter away and it's no louder than the PC it sits on.The inbuilt speakers are surprisingly good, you can easily watch a film right next to it with no issues. Obviously, not a lot of bass but very surprised.Set up is as easy as plugging it it and finding the right spot for it to sit, there doesn't seem to be a manual zoom, so the screen is dependant on how far away the projector is from the wall. In my pictures, the unit is maybe 5 metres away from the wall and 1.5m off the ground.Overall I'm very happy with the projector, even if I paid full price I think I would still be very happy.All I've used so far is the HDMI connection, I'm probably not going to bother with BT as its set up next to my PC.If you turn off the automatic adjustment in thr menu you can then use 4 point keystone manually. If you're not straight on to the way then the edges get blury a bit, only a problem when it comes to text on screen.Would be nice if there were some apps, it only has manual inputs. This isn't a negative point as its a projector and it still projects. But would of been a nice addition.",

A peine il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison qu'on l'a mont\u00e9 et c'est tout \u00e0 fait ce qu'on cherchais, surtout \u00e0 ce prix la, on ne voulais pas taper dans les grosses marque, certes on passe \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la 4k et du laser, mais franchement de loin, je vois pas trop la diff\u00e9rence (Y'en a une c'est certain mais j'ai pas assez l'\u0153il pour la voir) Donc ici du 1080p natif, avant on avais de la 720p, la diff\u00e9rence se voit tout de suite, c'est tellement nette, les couleurs sont tr\u00e8s bonnes aussi, loin d'un \u00e9cran oled par exemple, facile c'est sur mais bref. La luminosit\u00e9 est \u00e9poustouflante pour ce prix la je dois dire, on l'a test\u00e9 de plain jour juste volet semi ferm\u00e9 et on vois ultra bien, bon oui c'est mile fois mieux dans le noir complet. Le faite qu'il soit connect\u00e9 en wifi et ou en Bluetooth change tout, vous avez acc\u00e8s a votre smartphone aux mise \u00e0 jours s'il y'a etc... Bref il est connect\u00e9, mais pas android tv ou \u00e9quivalant par contre, il vous faudra un stick pour ajouter la fonction, nous \u00e7a nous d\u00e9range pas, puisqu'il est branch\u00e9 sur le pc en hdmi donc il lit tout. Les haut parleurs sont bons mais on sait tr\u00e8s bien que personnes ne s'en sert, et enfin il est tr\u00e8s silencieux, on l'oublie vite, enfin sa meilleurs fonction ou la j'ai dit \"Chapeau !\" C'est toute les corrections trap\u00e9zo\u00efdale, auto focus, horizontal et vertical automatiques, c'est g\u00e9nial, vous le poser, il bosse tout seul c'est super et pour le coup, c'est un sans faute cette partie la, ultra rapide et tr\u00e8s nette. Bref on recommande \u00e0 100% surtout quand y'a une promo.",
