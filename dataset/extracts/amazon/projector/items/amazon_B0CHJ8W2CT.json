The device is small and convenient but one star off because I'd like to take it outside but don't have an outlet for plug in and another star off because of how frustrating it was to get this started.This had an incredibly hard set up. It would not sync with my laptop and the instructions just seemed a little off. The wording seemed hard to follow.I liked the portable-ness of the device but did not like that it needed to be plugged in. I wanted to set this up in the part of my backyard that does not have an outlet so that won\u2019t be possible. Would be great if this could be truly portable.",
