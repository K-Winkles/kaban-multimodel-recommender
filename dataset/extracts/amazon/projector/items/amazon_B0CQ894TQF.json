                "reviewText": "I checked this out in my video room and it was bright enough for my 100 inch drop down screen. I used the HDMI input via a laptop and projected Amazon Prime Video. After some adjustments to contrast and brightness and color saturation the image was decent for standard resolution. I connected the projector easily to the internet and the menu's were easy to follow so overall for the price it seemed pretty good. This projector will be a nice addition to business presentations from a laptop when ocassionally needed and as it's so light and compact it will be easily toted and used on-the-fly. For the negatives: The supplied tripod needed a little swivel ball, which I had a few and added one and was able to fully adjust the units tilts etc. The remote control worked well provided you aimed it at a precise angle toward the front of the unit. I can't speak to how robust the unit will be over time it is very small and light in weight so more usage will tell. For the very modest price it will fit a niche with us, so I'm happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I have been wanting a projector for movie nights so when I saw this pre-order deal I snagged it. Setting it up right out of the box I was a little intimidated at first but it was all super easy. There is a remote (batteries not included) there is an hdmi cable, a power cable and an included tripod!The screen was user friendly and easy to navigate, especially with the remote. You have to point it directly at the projector at all times, it's not going to pick up if you point away or nearby like some tv remotes. There are buttons on top that will also navigate the screen if need be.The picture quality is crips, good colors, and bright. I turned it on in my dining room with window blinds open and did not have any problem with visuals whatsoever. To adjust the blurry screen you can either move the projector backward or forward, depending on how big or small you want the picture. Then turn the knob either right or left for sharpness. The knob was a little difficult to rotate, for me, but it worked fine.The fan noise is loud though, like distractingly loud. The volume on the projector is pretty good for indoors, it goes pretty high.Everything about this projector was going smoothly until I tried to use the screencast with my iphone. The manual kept saying to use your phone. Idk if this is a phone only projector but it was not screen casting with my iPhone, even though it says iPhone and android friendly. Anything I tried to screencast only registered as \"music\". Even personal videos from my photos app. So that was annoying.Then I pulled out my spare hdmi to usb-c cable to try my MacBook. When you are setting up a \"wired connection\" the manual says to just plug it in. That's what I did but nothing showed on the projector.THEN I tried to connect my iPad Air, the same thing happened. Plugged it in like the directions on screen said, no picture popped up. By this point I am annoyed and over it. Moments gone. I am thinking this is really meant only for androids or strictly for playing music. There is also an option to use a usb drive with downloaded movies or music, but no one does that anymore. Everything is through bluetooth or screen sharing. This projector is useless to me now. Very disappointing. See pics for reference.",

The quality of the imaging is excellent. so bright and vibrant even with the lights on, you can still clearly see what's being displayed.It's pretty straight forward in terms of use and comes with a lil tripod stand which I love.For cellphone connectivity however I though it was through Bluetooth, but it took me a second to realize that you can really only mirror the display on your cellphone. So for iPhone it's through airplay.Overall a really good projector at an amazing price.I'm happy with this purchase",
