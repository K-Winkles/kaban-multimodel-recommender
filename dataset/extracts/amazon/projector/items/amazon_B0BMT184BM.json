                "reviewText": "First of all, and most importantly, the picture quality is excellent. I project onto a projector screen mounted to the wall and it looks great. I\u2019ve watched a few different things, from comedies to action, movies, cartoons, and it all looks great. I\u2019ve only used HDMI extensively, but I have also connected my iPhone to the projector wirelessly, and it worked well. Truly good high definition viewing. The colors are great, the images are sharp, the picture is nice and bright, and everything is smooth.The auto focus and Keystone feature is fantastic and works great. When you turn the projector on it automatically does this for you and if it\u2019s just a little off, there is a button on your remote with a plus and negative sign to dial it in just a little more. I\u2019ve only done that maybe once, and it was such a minor change that it really didn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve never had to worry about fixing the Keystone, though, the projector gets that perfect every time.Obviously, the built in speakers aren't as good as an external Soundsystem, but they work really well. I\u2019ve connected my Bose Bluetooth speaker and it works really well and sounds really great with that. I would recommend you use an external speaker if you\u2019re watching something that really depends on loud volume, but if it\u2019s just for casual, watching in your bedroom, the internal speakers are more than fine.At the back, there are two USB inputs, two HDMI inputs, a socket for the AV adapter and an audio jack. The power cord plugs in at the side. On top, there are eight buttons, so if you lost the remote, you wouldn\u2019t be completely screwed. It has the power on button, the four directional buttons, a back button, a source button, and an OK button. At the bottom of the projector there are four rubberized feet and a height adjustable twist stand to aim the projector, if needed.In the box, there is a really nice carry backpack, the power cord, a remote, AV cables, a HDMI, cable, a lens cover, a cleaning kit, and, of course a nice thick user manual. Everything was packaged really well and obviously it has everything you need right out of the box.Personally, I don\u2019t think it runs loud at all, it\u2019s just got a small fan that deals with heat. Obviously, it\u2019s not silent by any means, but it also isn\u2019t too loud. The fan blows at a low pitch as well so the bit of sound it does make is easily down out by the built-in speakers.Overall, it\u2019s a great unit, especially for the price it\u2019s a really good deal. The picture quality plus the auto focus alone make this worth the price. It is well made from what I can tell, and just like anything, if you look after it, it\u2019ll probably last longer than if you don\u2019t. Great product.",

                "reviewText": "The portable projector I recently purchased has surpassed all my expectations. Despite its affordability, this device doesn't compromise on quality and offers an incredible cinematic experience with a crystal clear picture.The user interface is designed with simplicity in mind, making it a breeze to navigate. The device possesses two HDMI ports, allowing for seamless video input. Switching the source is a hassle-free process, use the buttons on the projector or the remote.While I haven't had the chance to test out the USB drive playback feature, the option certainly adds to the versatility of the projector. The speakers, incorporated within the device, deliver surprisingly good sound quality. However, for a heightened audio experience, I paired it with a Roku sound bar and the result was astounding.The standout feature of this projector is its autofocus. It's the best I've encountered so far, enabling a perfect picture quality every time. The zooming function, coupled with the fine-tuning dial, allows for a customized viewing experience to suit individual preferences.To sum it up, this portable projector is a solid product that offers unrivaled value for money. Its fantastic picture quality, easy-to-use interface, and impressive sound system make it a must-have for any movie lovers looking for an immersive home theater experience. The additional features of autofocus and zoom further enhance the utility of this device, making it a purchase you won't regret.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I already have a Yaber v10 (which I love and now have set up in my office) but wanted another projector for the family room and travel. I bought this model because of its portability and the auto focus/auto keystone functions and it does not disappoint.The projector is mostly for the family room but also for some backyard movie nights, camping and my kid to take to friends (the backpack Yaber packaged it in makes that handy). Because the projector will have multiple uses I didn't want it to be a huge hassle every time it gets set up in a new location - that's where the auto focus/keystone function comes in handiest. In literally a few seconds, with the press of just one button on the remote, all the fuss of setting up a perfectly square frame and getting it in focus is gone. The auto focus is especially impressive - it is sharp and deadly accurate no matter where I place the projector which is a hundred times more convenient than me adjusting the focus, walking up to the screen to check, walking back to projector to adjust again, rechecking at screen, etc. Makes solo setup a breeze.Now, as for the picture quality - it is excellent. Nice rich colours, deep blacks and good contrast. And the brightness is far better than I expected. This will get a lot of use during the daytime and has enough power to still give a great picture without being washed out by the sunlight from the adjoining rooms (see the attached video and pictures which were all taken mid afternoon with plenty of light still in room - projection will be even better when we get some blackout curtains installed.)Was super easy to plug in my 4K AppleTv and 1080p Roku with the 2 hdmi inputs and the projector automatically adjusted to their respective resolution qualities. Very happy the projector accomodates the HDR settings on my AppleTV to give the best possible picture.Setting up the projector with my soundbar and subwoofer system was fast and simple using the bluetooth function. it paired right away and is working beautifully with zero sync or dropout issues. I did try out the built-in speaker and it is decent. It cant compete with a full sound system but is fantastic for a stand-alone built-in speaker. Crisp, clear sound and didn't distort even at full volume.Overall it's a great little unit. Compact size makes it perfect for portability and has a sleek modern look to fit in with decor at home. Super convenient to set-up and the menus are easy to navigate for additional functions like the auto shutoff timer. And the most important aspect - the picture quality - is where this projector shines. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "After 8 years my JmGO projector decided to retire so my initial research to decide on a replacement led me to expert online reviews, but most of the recommended machines were either super expensive or had their own limitations. So instead I decided to look in Amazon for sth in my intended price range and filter for top buyer reviews in Amazon. This is how I ended up chosing Yaber and I have no regrets. This is unbelievable value for money with decent sound and a really good, bright, crisp picture. I only use the white wall in my bed room and was surprised how much better the picture was compared to my old JmGO. The most amazing features are keystone and auto focus. It makes it so easy to adjust the picture, even with my unusual constraints at home (projector is 5.5m away from wall but screen size had to be max 2.5m. The menu is easy to navigate. I can also do screen mirroring with both Android and iPhone iPad. Plus, this marvel comes with a 3 year warranty. Can't get any better.",

                "reviewText": "Ho acquistato il proiettore Yaber V9 la scorsa estate e devo dire che sono rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso dalla sua performance e dal rapporto qualit\u00e0/prezzo.La definizione (full HD) e il contrasto sono molto buoni. Proiettando su uno schermo di 110 pollici e guardando da una distanza di circa 3 metri, l'immagine risulta ben definita. Per ottenere la massima qualit\u00e0 visiva consiglio di utilizzare film in BluRay e dedicare un po' di tempo alla calibrazione di luminosit\u00e0, contrasto e nitidezza con i pattern reperibili online.La luminosit\u00e0 (500 ANSI Lumen), pur essendo pi\u00f9 bassa di quella dei proiettori tradizionali con lampada alogena, \u00e8 comunque soddisfacente. L'immagine \u00e8 visibile anche proiettando direttamente su una parete e in presenza di luce ambientale. Tuttavia, l'esperienza ottimale si raggiunge in una stanza buia, proiettando su uno schermo.L\u2019autofocus \u00e8 veloce e preciso. \u00c8 comodo se si sposta spesso il proiettore o se si azzera la messa a fuoco allo spegnimento per poter coprire la lente con il tappo in dotazione.Il rumore della ventola \u00e8 relativamente basso e non risulta fastidioso. Personalmente uso il proiettore con un impianto home theater 5.1 e il rumore non si nota affatto.In conclusione, credo che questo sia un ottimo proiettore per avere un\u2019esperienza \u201ccinematografica\u201d a casa senza spendere una fortuna.",

Everything works very well as it says in the description. Wifi 6 makes the internet connection super fast. The auto focus is a great feature. It does the focusing work perfectly. I don't have to do it manually. This feature is a blessing for those who use it as a portable projector. Just turn it on and the projector will auto focus. It came with a back pack. So carrying it outdoor is very easy. The projector has a native 1080P resolution and supports 4K movie playback. I am using it in my home theater. I connected Google TV 4K to this projector. Amazon Fire Stick or Roku also can be connected. Now I can play any videos from YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Plex etc. All in high resolution. I can play 4K videos from YouTube and Plex and the video quality is amazing. I am posting a video and some pictures with this review. Please check them to see the quality. There are 2 USB ports, 2 HDMI ports, AV port and Audio port. They are enough to connect audio video devices to this projector. The 12W speaker in the projector is good enough to fill quality sound in the room. You can connect Bluetooth speakers or Bluetooth headset to it. I connected my speaker system using HDMI cable and the sound quality is great.The USB port can be used to play movies from USB devices and display Microsoft Word, Excel or Power Points to the screen. It is very good for presentations. With Miracast (Android) and iOS Cast options in the projector, it is easy to cast photos or videos from phone or tablet to the screen. This is worth to buy.",
