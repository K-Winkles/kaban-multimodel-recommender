                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE - Received Defective Unit, New One is Awesome",
                "reviewText": "UPDATE- The company reached out to me and sent me a new one, so I decided to review it fairly.I believe I received a defective unit, so I highly recommend everyone who purchases this item to test it properly, because a working one of these is great:***Upon opening the projector, you\u2019re greeted by a very cute small backpack that opens all the way to reveal the projector and a few cables - hdmi, AV (I think), and the power cord. You also have a manual and a remote.The projector itself comes with a lens cap, and is absolutely amazing. You\u2019re greeted with the home screen, which gives you access to each input, and the settings. I connected a Chromecast to this, but the screen share on it is amazing and reliable. I\u2019m able to connect my phone within just a few seconds.The quality is definitely 1080p, and the focus is super easy. However, the part that stands out to me the most is keystone. I can put my projector anywhere in my room and keystone it so that it looks straight. This feature makes it so worth it, because it maintains the quality really well.In terms of brightness, the projector is pretty bright. At nighttime you might have to turn the brightness down, and you can see the screen in a light daylight, I\u2019d definitely not recommend trying it in direct sunlight though.I watched a 3 hour movie and a few episodes of a show today, and it was great. No burning, no overheating, nothing. Only time will tell if it survives, but customer service is great to contact if you need any help or notice anything strange.The only thing I wish it had was Bluetooth, which can be solved with a Bluetooth adapter that plugs into the unit\u2019s USB port.Regardless, for the price, this is definitely the best and simplest projector you can buy if you\u2019re hosting a party outdoors, indoors, or just need something quick and easy.\u2014old review below\u2014I received this projector this afternoon and was so pleasantly surprised when opening it. It arrived in a whole backpack! I was stunned. I began removing the accessories, setting everything up, and turned it on. It was beautiful, especially the keystone correction was amazing.Then comes nighttime. I turned it back on with my friends to watch my first movie on it. In the middle of the movie, my friend closest to the projector said he smelled something funny. We all looked over at the projector to see it smoking from the vents. The screen began turning brown, so we quickly unplugged the projector and put it on the floor so it doesn\u2019t burn our tableWhat started as such an amazing purchase turned into a disaster, in only a few hours. Looking at the other reviews I see similar things have happened after months of usage, but I also see so much positivity. Are these just defective units? I can\u2019t imagine something that looked so promising can spontaneously combust. Now the projector shows brown all over the image, and I won\u2019t keep it on for more than 2 minutes or else it heats up quickly.I really wish this worked for me.",

                "reviewText": "I have this projector mounted on a shelf across the room and hitting a wall without any special paints or screen. It shows up well even when it is light outside or the lights are on in the room. The picture is pretty good, and the included speaker works well enough if you are bringing it for traveling or a presentation. If not, just get a 3.5mm aux cable and run the sound to any speakers you want. The remote works really well, I can point it forward towards the screen and still control the projector even though it is above my head and behind me. My only complaint is that the markings have no backlight and don't glow in the dark so it can be difficult to see the remote when the lights are off.The 4-point keystone option in the projector's settings lets you adjust the image to unconventional spaces while keeping the proportions undistorted really well.",

Recommend using a sound-bar or other speakers for general use when possible. Using a Bluetooth adapter or streaming device such as Apple TV or something similar that is Bluetooth compatible is recommended both for sound and streaming purposes.Picture \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fOverall picture quality and projection capability of 300 inches is fantastic for its class and price point! Contrast is greatHowever, where it lacks is the slightly limited ability to make adjustments to brightness and when using for gameplay or anything other than general movie/tv as well as generic functionality with other controls such as the keystone feature, menu and general operation.For optimal picture quality, a high quality white screen in a completely dark room will provide a fantastic viewing experience! If using outside or in a room without the ability to obtain complete darkness a Silver screen would be ideal for the best contrast and darkest blacks, this will slightly reduce brightness of vivid colors but most silver screens will give a gain of at least 1.3 helping to keep colors vivid and bright.Remote \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThe remote design is good to great, but has a delay and sometimes seems to not send a signal to the projector.Overall Value \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fUser friendly, quick setup for portable use, clear and crips picture and sound. Up to 300 inch projection, and great viewing angle.If you don\u2019t mind spending the money on a high end projector, that would be recommend! But if you are seeking a great projector with a limited budget this is a great option and very well worth its price! If you\u2019re new to this hobby this is projector is the perfect option! But do yourself a favor and spend some time researching screen gain, types of screens and what your best option is based on how dark or light your viewing area will be.",

Buscaba un proyector nuevo, pero hasta que encontr\u00e9 \u00e9ste que une todos mis deseos, tiene Bluetooth, Wifi, Miracast instalado, bocinas buenas, HD de 1080 y un contraste de 10000:1 y eso se ve a la primera encendida! Hasta un filtro que se puede limpiar despu\u00e9s de largo uso. Me encant\u00f3! Y estoy muy emocionada para ver mis pelis en grande y a buena calidad.",
