The finer dust can still accumulate on the color wheel, leading to degraded images and reduced brightness.The bulbs in traditional lamp projectors often reach temperatures as high as 800~900\u00b0C while operating, occasionally even forcing automatic shutdowns due to heat surges. The fact of the matter is that projectors need to be dust-resistant\uff01 In recent years, CIBEST has been actively investing in and developing dust-resistant technology for use in our Projectors.The CIBEST Android TV Projectors feature comprehensive dustproof technology with a sealed optical engine to fully protect chips, color wheels, and other optical components.

The auto focus is cool. it has Google play store so you can download all your streaming apps to the projector without having to use a separate device. Although it does have an hdmi port on it and I have played my Xbox on the projector. It would be fun to play Mario kart or something on there. It's a good deal if you get it on sale!",

Best picture quality in a mostly dark room.",

                "reviewText": "For the price (I paid under 50 bucks as a \"used\" warehouse unit), this projector is awesome. True native 1080p, above average sound for a projector (louder than the speakers on my 40\" element led tv), loud enough to enjoy normal programming indoors without external audio. The brightness is way better than the last projector I owned, u can watch it with the lights on. I wasn't expecting that. Awesome. Of course, better with lights dim or off completely but definitely watchable in regular lighted space indoors. Haven't tried outdoors yet. Plenty of I/O solutions. I use a roku stick and stream from netflix, amazon, or I cast from Samsung phone or my Asus laptop. Only con I have found, which isn't enough to knock off a star, especially since it's clearly represented if you're paying attention.... This sucker is ginourmous. Not gonna fit in ur pocket, purse, or even a small backpack.... The box it comes in makes an excellent padded case for light portability. Even has a handle. If you can find a deal on this projector snatch it up",

This is my 2nd projector.And wowww this one blows my first one away...The quality of this is brilliant.Treated myself as a Christmas box and very happy The quality at 80 inch tested in kitchen on white wall.. and 120 inch my main living room screen...amazing... The sound is good for some films.other films can be a tad quiet.Nothing a Bluetooth soundbar cant fix i have a 50 watt soundbar and connect to this projector the sound is like imax.The android 10 is a added bonus easy to install Netflix and a variety of apps.5 gigs of storage for apps so more than enough for your main apps.The fan noise is very quiet.It gets a little hot heat at the side and can give out a smell.Maybe its because it new.Only used it today...The remote lets it down though,It can be very sticky and freeze alot when scrolling And it a pain if you need to type passwords and email addresses slow and sticks.Not sure if a remote software update is needed. I have enclosed some photos and few videos.Overall this is the best money i have ever spent ,And i am very happy with my purchase.Thank you",

The colours are bright and sound is good from unit but drops out regularly when connected to a bluetooth speaker (not that it's really needed). The built in TV player (Netflix and other Android apps) is great and you can stream all normal account TV direct to the projector which is a great feature that works well. Autofocus is poor and not precise and manual focus mode appears to have 'stops' which prevent you getting a really clear picture at times which is frustrating. Biggest issue is the fact that the screen size on the main projector 'settings' page is massive and not adjustable meaning that using any of the settings is fiddly and full of guesswork as they are cast off of the screen on walls and curtains. Once set up though, this isn't an issue as they aren't needed again. All in all, for the price, a good purchase that works well",

This projector is awesome, I mean you can watch it without the curtains being shut although obviously it's so much better in the dark. Sound is pretty good too and the fact it's got android to boot...... Well worth the money!",
