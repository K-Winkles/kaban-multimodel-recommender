                "reviewText": "Great projector, very clear, bright, and easy set up. Auto screen sizing and auto keystone works well. Remote easy to figure out if you want to use it (also has buttons on projector for setup). Fan noise is noticeable, but not bad unless you're in a really small room. Needed to cool the bright bulb.So far have connected it to my laptop (usb connection is laggy so use HDMI if you can) and wirelessly to my iPad. Direct wireless connection to iPad was really easy, took about 1 minute to download app, projector shows QR code, pointed my iPad at it and bam it was connected. Could project my iPad pictures just like old school slide projector.Very small light projector so it's easily portable. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. The included soft-sided carry case has some padding, but a hard-sided case would probably be a good idea if you transport it a lot to protect your investment. Wouldn't want to drop it in the soft-sided case.I recommend this if you are looking for a good quality projector and can afford it.",

                "reviewText": "Not cheap, great image and very bright. The combination of 3000+ lumens and WXGA, with a very light unit makes this my top choice. I've compared many projectors, and this is by far my preferred traveling projector. Larger than those mini-sized, yes, but I can project in well-lit rooms and still have plenty of brightness where those cheap mini projectors would be nearly invisible onscreen.Used extensively for travel and presentations, a good resolution for photo/video, and does a great job of self-focus. I very rarely have to tweak anything, except when I'm in a bad room with steep angles and poor projection surface. Even then, it gets pretty close on its own to squaring up the screen.The auto-adjust is a little sensitive to movement, say if someone bumps the table hard enough. It will sense the change and readjust, which is distracting at times.The remote is effective. This allows USB as a video hookup, but this was unusably laggy in my experience, and also caused stutter in my video/audio output. (Windows 8 Pro, Lenovo laptop of 2016 vintage.) I switched back to HDMI, and all problems ceased.One thing to be aware of, if this needs repair, you may have mixed results with Epson. On a previous projector (same model), I was forced to check my bag on the airline, and found that when I got it back later, the corner of the projector had been cracked where the leveling leg is. Epson sent me to an authorized repair center, which could not fix the issue because Epson did not supply those parts. The projector functions fine, just does not have the screw-down leveling leg working any more. So, good example of how tough it is, I guess, still works after a good smack, but would love to have some repair option besides a DIY epoxy fix.",

                "reviewText": "WoW!! My hubby encouraged me to spend the money and get a high-end projector. I used it the first time today and I must say that hubby was right. I downloaded and ran the executable file for the USB connection. All I had to do was connect the laptop to the projector, turn on both than walk away. The projector automatically detected the screen, adjusted to the screen size, adjusted the keystone then waited for me to start my presentation. No more anxiety about AV and if it will or will not work at my next training.Several audience members commented on how bright and clear to display was. A few said it was the best display they had ever seen and that the picture was so clear and crisp that it looks like a television, not a projected image.Others will talk about the lumens, how it does the magic tricks, brightness, etc. I want it simple and predictable. This projector more than fits that bill.",

I also installed Epson iPhone app and now I can project certain files (photos, documents, webpage, but NOT videos on my phone) through my home wifi network. No screen mirroring for iOS though. I guess the mirroring function only works for Android system.The network configuration is not user friendly. I found my home network and entered the password; but the projector does not tell you whether you are successfully connected or not. One thing I wasn't expect was the noise level. The project gets hot pretty quick and the fan becomes very loud. I also connected my PS4 and played a few games. It is not good for gaming because it does not show dark very well. I mostly use the project for my computer, so I am happy with the overall performance.",
