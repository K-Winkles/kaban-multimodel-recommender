                "media_text": "Why Projection? Simply put, when it comes to watching movies or playing video games, bigger is always better. Sitting at appropriate distance from a 100-inch or larger image engages more of your peripheral vision, lets you see details that are lost on most TVs, and attract you into the story in a way that's just not possible with even a 75- or 85-inch flatpanel. If you turn off your phone like you do down at the cineplex, it makes movie viewing a true escape. Why Choose A Home projector Not a TV? The biggest difference between a TV and a projector is the size of image you can get. A projector will give you a massive 100\"+ image. Many people have a 120\u201d and even 150\u201d screens in their home. The average home television is usually around 50\"-65\".Projectors are far more portable. Large TV's can weigh 100kg or even more! Most projectors will weigh around 5kg, so you can easily take it with you to a mates place or take it to work for a presentation. Large TV's require specialty delivery and installation services.Better for your eyes. When you view a projected image you are viewing reflected light. This is far easier on the eyes than direct light shining at your from a TV.Better for the environment. Projectors are smaller and use far less materials to manufacture than a typical TV. New Laser type projectors also more energy efficient.Safety. Large TV's can weigh over 80kg so should be secured to ensure they can't fall. There have been cases where children have accidentally knocked a TV and had it fall on them. Projectors can be secured to the ceiling out of reach. If using a large TV always make sure it is secured to the wall so it cannot fall.Immersion. There is nothing like watching a big hollywood blockbuster on the big screen at home. Watching on a big projection screen simply doesn't compare with a TV.",

They incorporate a wide range of hues to ensure there is no \u201cbleeding\u201d at the edges. With the vibrant colors, the viewing experience is the same regardless of your sitting position or distance from the screen. Sharper Detail and Enhanced Clarity The average 1080p projector delivers five times the resolution on your Standard Definition TV. This dramatic difference in sharpness is instantly visible. You will notice finer details like color specks in the eyes of video characters, sweat drops, creases and other such finer details that can be lost otherwise. Regardless of whether you need a projector for business or for your home theatre, a 1080p projector will deliver better clarity in comparison to lower options.",

You\u2019ll sometimes hear more cynical experts referring to standard lumens as \u201cmarketing lumens\u201d because the figures are so often fudged or inflated. If there is an ANSI lumen rating on a projector, this is the one you should go by; if it only says \u201clumens,\u201d you may need to take the rating with a grain of salt, especially if you\u2019re not familiar with the brand. QK06 video projector offers 350 ASIN high brightness and 90% NTSC color gamut. You'll get sharper, more vibrant colors and a brighter picture.

The screen plays pretty decent during the day time but at night it\u2019s even better. It\u2019s a tad bit noisy but you don\u2019t notice it after awhile.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this projector for my backyard and I'm very happy with it. Here are some of the things I liked and disliked about it:- Pros: - The price to performance ratio is high. It delivers an amazing picture quality for its cost. - It has a crisp and bright picture. I used it with a 150-inch screen and watched some baseball games. The colors were vibrant and the details were sharp. - It has a decent built-in speaker. It was loud enough for me to hear the commentary and the crowd noise. - It operates quietly. It is much quieter than my old projector, which used to make a lot of noise. - It is easy to set up and use. I hooked up a Fire TV stick using the HDMI port and the built-in USB port for power. Everything worked smoothly.- Cons: - The built-in airplay feature couldn't handle protected content. It worked fine when I mirrored my phone screen for photos and videos I took, but it blacked out when I tried to play protected content, such as Netflix or Hulu.Overall, I think this projector is a great buy for anyone. It is perfect for watching movies, sports, or games with your family or friends.I give this projector 5 stars out of 5.",

It\u2019s very simple to set up, directions are super helpful and packaging protected it despite holiday mail rush. If you don\u2019t mind the visuals being 2-3 seconds later than the sounds heard\u2026 it\u2019s perfect. Some shows I revert to the TV because it can be annoying to hear action sounds or voices then see what happened seconds later (crying emoji) super crisp and giant presentation plus well priced.

You can tell from the video I attached that even when the room's lights are on the picture is still very watchable. When the lights are off it's like a wall size TV. The sound is decent. The remote is great. The unit is light, quiet, and easy to use. It has all the inputs you'd expect of a much more expensive unit. It's not the best projector I've ever seen.
