I\u2019m a techy guy so I know I wasn\u2019t missing any steps so I returned it simply because of the inability to connect via Airplay",

                "reviewText": "This 1080P Full HD Resolution Mini Projector gives off bright vivid and vibrant LCD colors, and provides a very clear picture for watching movies and videos. Works off 5G WiFi Connection with little to no lag time. This mini projector is small and lightweight. It measures 5\u201dx4.7\u201dx2\u201d and can easily fit in your purse or backpack, making this a convenient and transportable drvice. It is very easy to travel with. This has a Built-in dual 5.1 Blutooth Speaker technology that works amazing for its size. This also has a Zoom function with a 4:3/16:9 aspect ratio, and a 3.5-35ft projection distance. Easy to set up and use. Connect this projector to your Bluetooth device and you are ready to go. This can be used with most Bluetooth devices because it has a built-in HDMI, AV, USB, and 3.5mm headphone port and is compatible with TV Stick/Box, PS3/4/5, PCs, Smartphones, Tablets, and Laptops. This comes with everything you need for a successful watching experience.I got this to replace a tv in my daughters bedroom that broke. We put it on a small desk and pointed it at her white bedroom wall. She was able to stream and watch her movies that she's been using her phone for on a bigger picture right on her wall. I think this is a very nice and convenient product that can be utilized in many ways for leisure, home and for office. It is durable and sturdy and will hopefully last. This also comes with a convenient remote control. I definitely reccomend giving this device a try. The mini projector is a great value when compared to similar items with what this one offers. Thank you",
