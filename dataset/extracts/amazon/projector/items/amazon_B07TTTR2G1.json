They provided 2 year warranty on it though and and a label so I\u2019m about to ship it out. I\u2019ll keep you updated. I had to insist my model had a two year warranty though to the warranty rep before he honored it. Normally they only offer one year.A little backstory on this issue is that I got a Sonos arc earlier in late 2020 and after using atmos for almost 6 months the audio started dropping out and projector overheating. So I actually bought the HD fury arcana to split the signal and reduce the strain on the projector since it doesn\u2019t have hdmi eArc, just HDMI Arc which it uses a spare pin on the cable for a lossy atmos connection. We\u2019ll a few weeks later it failed anyways so I guess I was too late. :(.***OG Review.The first one I ordered had problems.The second one seems much betterIt\u2019s worth noting that they are using different ir receivers for the speakers vs the projector so if you are putting things in cabinets you may need to run a repeater to this unit specifically.Sound is as good as any tv.Picture is fantastic. I can watch tv in broad daylight again or with the lights on even if I need to. It\u2019s pretty wonderful.4K hdr works really well. Took a little learning to make it work with Xbox One S. You have to disable some \u201cauto features\u201d and enable it on the projector for the port that Xbox is running on.****More UPDATES:Projector is still solid but I figured I would note a few things. That might help people make a decision.Some good.You\u2019re paying for excellence. It\u2019s the shortest throw ratio I could find and the brightest picture at the time. The other projector by .... optima? Has more Lumens but a longer throw ratio making infinitely more cumbersome. Seriously. 5 inches from the wall means 15 inches in height and it makes all the difference in the world.The vava projector is worse on both counts, throw ratio and lumens.I wish they had a wireless surround system you could integrate in, but I\u2019ve figure out how to make own mostly. I started with the iogear wireless hdmi but eventually gave up and gave into Sonos arc + Sonos sub + Sonos amp.Initially I hung the screen in the wall but after moving this time I just bought a floor rising screen and it work really well. Worth every penny, aside form the shipping damage (which vividstorm is replacing for me).They recently updated it so you could connect with Alexa and google home. Shows investment in the productThe magic remote is dope. Between the harmony app, the harmony remote, and the magic remote I can control all my devices and I have enough controllers that I can lose a few and still watch tv. LolSome not so good:HomeKit/Apple TV isn\u2019t available yet and they haven\u2019t committed to support it either... I got around this with a harmony hub originally now I use homebridge.The edge adjustment is useful but cumbersome. If it had to do it often I would send this back. I wish I could grab the edge and drag it to where I wanted it but it\u2019s literally clicking a direction over and over again.This thing needs great airflow. I\u2019m building a cabinet for the screen and projector and oh boy... trying to come up with an design that is beautiful, functional, and maximum airflow is challenging.Every once in a while I think it shuts off to cool itself down and I have to hard reset to get it to work again. Worrisome but not troublesome.I wish the magic remote mouse was available on my Xbox. Lol",

                "reviewText": "I have had my HU85LA and 120\u201d Grandview UST screen for two weeks now. Here are my impressions coming from OLED:Pros:-Very bright and vivid colors-Fan noise not very loud-Does not give off a lot of heat-120\u201d is very immersive compared to my 65\u201d OLED-ATSC Digital Tuner-3 Lasers (1 Red, 1 Blue, 1 Blue with Static Phosphor for Green)-120\" Screen at only 7.2\" from wall to back of projectorCons:-No color black option-Ordered first one from amazon new and it had a very loud coil whine. Returned and bought open box from another authorized dealer and this one does not have coil whine. If it does it hardly noticeable compared to the first one. YMMV.-Placement is almost impossible to perfect. I\u2019ve spent over 12 hours total easily adjusting feet, position and screen where I wanted to pull my hair out and how tedious it is to get picture aligned. See attached setup with less than ideal stand but finally got it 97% fit with NO edge adjustment.Advice: screen flatness is key. I had to remove tension from mounting bracket to alleviate most of the fit issue. Thinking Tightening the brackets would make the screen more flat but it did the opposite. Also if your wall it not perfectly flat, it will cause alignment issues.-Struggles to output video without static fuzzy and black screen flickering when ATV4K set to Match Frame Rate On. Have to restart the projector to fix video output. Hit or miss if a video plays with it turned on.-No HLG support (ATSC 3.0 when rolled out to US will use HLG format)-No Apple TV app, HomeKit, Disney+ app etc support for expensive mid-high end USTPJ (but most have streaming device to AVR so not complete deal breaker)-Blacks are sacrificed but Dynamic Tone Mapping takes what is bearable to watch and then makes dark scenes unwatchable-120\" screen edges start to lose focus and appears to maintain sharp edges at 110\" and not so much at the maxThe cons seem big but this is my first projector and media room so it was a big learning experience. I installed myself so growing pains are expected. I do love the upgrade from OLED to Projector mainly because I wanted immersive viewing experience and could sacrifice the perfect blacks and dark highlights. In the dark, movies look very good after using calibration settings found online. Shadow detail is definitely lost compared to OLED and more grayish in really dark scenes. Dynamic Tone Mapping fails miserably and recommend to leave it turned off. Dark scenes are even harder to watch with DTM turned on and lose lots of detail to darkness. LG needs to provide a more precise way to adjust the projector on a mount of some kind and or recommendation for ceiling mounting (not sure if that increases alignment difficulty or not). Sony's USTPJ has some vertical/horizontal alignment screen adjustment which this LG sorely needs.At MSRP, I find this projector hard to recommend against the competitors. Finding an open box is the best value as I did. As expected with new technology and LG first gen UST, you are paying for the initial R&D.",
