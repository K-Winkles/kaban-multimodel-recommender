                "reviewText": "I got the chance to try out my nice little travel-sized projector last weekend, and it worked great! I travel with my kids a lot, and they always want to have a movie night. This projector is small enough to fit in my travel backpack and use on trips.The tripod that comes with the projector is great, and provides for easy setup. Also, the keystone adjustment is super helpful for easy/fast setup.I was able to easily connect the projector to my external Bluetooth speaker. There is audio built into the projector itself, but you will find that by connecting an external Bluetooth speaker, you will get much better sound quality for viewing movies. It's easily configurable in the settings menu.As with any small projector at this price-point, you'll need to have a very dark room (or outside at nighttime). Using a projector screen also provides a better image vs. a white wall or a bed sheet.This projector has an on/off button at the top, and then a separate on/off switch on the back. I mention this because for travel purposes, the manual switch is great for keeping the projector in off mode while in a suitcase or backpack so that it does not accidently turn on.I found the image quality to be good enough for a quick/easy movie setup. Obviously there are projectors that produce better images and 4K quality, but they cost a lot of money and I wouldn't let my kids use an expensive projector. To me this projector his the sweet-spot between value and image quality that I was looking for.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this on Black Friday 2023 for an amazing price. All the reviews at that time were for the larger non battery operated model which is why I am reviewing this smaller version. I figured for the prices it would not live up to the hype. But it's excellent. I think it really is native 1080p. It also down converts 4k nicely. Great picture, will run for a while on battery (not for an entire movie) and I did not notice any change in brightness of picture quality on battery, remote is nice and lots of ports in the back. The size is slightly larger than it looks in the factory picture with the hand but it is very portable.Feels high quality. Even then packaging is great.Also comes with a nice mini tripod and high speed HDMI cable. I have not played with any settings yet as the picture was great out of the box. I will update my review after I use it more.Downsides: for a projector in this price range there really aren't any. But if I had to pick a couple one would be the keystone correction is manual and only a few degrees of correction, but you also don't lose any resolution like the digital ones. It would be nice if they put a bigger battery in it but at this prices point it is amazing it's 1080p and has any battery.Note: The picture example is without changing any default picture settings in a fairly dark room. The picture can get much brighter but not bright enough for a bright room.",

                "reviewText": "Until this purchase I was using an Artograph wall projector for my drawing layouts. It was large and cumbersome and difficult to set in place and use, as I was always need to be contorted on the floor with the paper taped up against a wall. Before LED bulbs, the heat of the old ones would cause the reference picture to warp and wrinkle and shifting about the image being projected on the wall. Totally drove me nuts! But with this new digital projector, I can mount it on my old tripod and pretty much place it atop the table and project the image right down on the paper. And what's best is that I can use any reference image I find on the laptop simply by attaching the provided HDMI cable. Although it doesn't work on my older Toshiba Satellite laptop, I have no issues at all with my Acer Nitro (it did, however, take me a few minutes to figure out that I needed to hit the input selector switch to toggle viewing options for laptop). Great product at a reasonable price. I just hope it lasts.",

I like to just put it on when I want to watch something in bed like youtube or movie since my monitor is small and I have no TV. The output display is also pretty clear as long as you properly adjust the magnifiers. I also recently bought a Nintendo Switch, so I'm hoping I can start to bring the projector switch around to use with that. I would say this is worthy of purchasing since its portable, small and simple to use. Just plug in the device and switch to that input device.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I did a bit of research on projectors looking at known brands like the Anker Nebula series and lesser/uknown brands like this.Turns out, there's actually not a lot of difference, statistically speaking, as a lot of the components used in them are the same, the lifetime of the lamps are roughly the same but you can get a higher quality image at less than half the cost of same spec projectors from the Nebula series. So I settled on this BIGASUO model in part because of the huge voucher discount too.I was a bit nervous last night after taking the plunge, however, I have been pleasantly surprised!It was incredibly simple to set up out the box, the manual is basically a flyer and may as well be considered plug and play.The image quality is amazing! I honestly am shocked. It truly is 1080p, the image is crisp all the way up to the edges and the colours are perfect. The video you can see is about 50\" but having tested it against my bookcases - it's just as good when you project all the way up to 100\".Finally, I wasn't actually aware that this had an internal speaker when I bought it, and when I read it on the box I wasn't expecting much... but this is amazing. It is hands down better sound quality than my portable speaker which cost almost as much as the projector itself!I'm over the moon with this projector. Always thought you had to pay an arm and a leg for good quality but this has proven me wrong.Things to note:- I bought some \"S hooks\" for the 100\" screen for when I use this outside in the summer. This will allow me to hook it up to my clothes line/ gazebo - whatever.- If you truly want the cinema experience, I would recommend buying some speakers for directional sound. While the sound quality is good - it's pretty obvious it's only coming from behind you where the projector is and it could do with a bit more bass.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking to buy a projector for weeks now and having researched nearly every affordable projector on Amazon and other sites, I decided this projector offered all that I was looking for. The added bonus was the DVD player which I didn\u2019t even think of, but as a family we love watching old movies so this is a fantastic extra.I only today received the projector and I can honestly say I am delighted with my purchase. I have played the DVD which and also plugged in Now TV fire stick and have Netflix set up and running.The picture quality is excellent. I tested the projector to make sure it was working on my patio door curtains which are wrinkled but even at that I felt I was sitting in the cinema watching a movie. The fan you can hear only if you are sitting right beside it, but once you move away the sound is drowned out by the movie itself and this really is not a problem. This would be something that would put me off purchasing any projector, but the fan is fine. The sound quality is very good and you can add a sound bar if needed. If you love to watch movies on a big screen while not breaking the bank - this is really a fantastic option.I have yet to connect the blue tooth but give me a few days and I will have figured out the full potential of this projector. It is not hard to set up - good manual and remote control. It\u2019s bright and crisp and if you go to menu and set it up as per instructions in the manual - you will enjoy a clear bright picture quality. I bought this to watch movies outside which I can\u2019t wait to do over the weekend.The free screen is made of material which the kids can use, but I will try my garden wall first and then decide whether to get a large out door screen. This projector is so versatile- you can flip it to play movies on the ceiling. It has fixtures for a tripod so what more could you want. I know we will enjoy this projector and my friend now wants to buy one.It is small and compact and comes with three plugs for different countries if you want to take this on holiday. It would be nice if it came with a carry bag but this would only add to it\u2019s appeal and would be an added bonus.I give this 5 stars - great little projector",

On my video, the sound is at half. You can hear the fan whilst the projector is running, but it really is bearable and doesn't affect viewing pleasure.This projector has been given 5 star approval from every member of my family, we're all extremely impressed by all its features and quality!The 100\" screen that comes with the projector can also be seen on my video, it is of nice quality. The 12 eyelets are all secure, although I have only used 4 of them to temporarily hang the screen.So portable, versatile, & easy to use.. within minutes, a quiet drink on a Friday night, suddenly became a Top Gun movie night in the conservatory, & we plan to move our movie nights outdoors once the summer returns again.We thoroughly love our latest purchase, and highly recommend this one if you're thinking of getting one, genuinely cannot fault it at all!",

I did get it at 25% off however and am glad that I bought it and can recommend it and am looking forward to someone producing anHD blu ray version at a reasonable price.T.E.",

                "reviewText": "I got this projector as I\u2019ve been wanting to dip my toe into the home-cinema experience for a while, but didn\u2019t want to invest a lot of money into it yet.I was very pleased with how it worked and the ease of setting it up - used with AppleTV (HD). Overall very happy with the quality for the price and will consider an upgrade to a more expensive projector having seen this as an entry level model - something quieter and brighter.Pros:Good sharp picture for HD filmsConnection to Bluetooth speaker works wellIncluded screen works well and is a nice feature for the priceCons:Very limited keystone adjustmentNoisy fanOff-centre connection for tripod, makes fixing tricky to stand / tripodNot super-bright, viewing needs to be in a room with no other light source",
