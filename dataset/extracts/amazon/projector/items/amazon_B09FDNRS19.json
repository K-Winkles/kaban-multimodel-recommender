                "reviewText": "It came with no projector screen even though other customers reported receiving one and no proper additions to attach it to your phone or tablet so you can play it off there. Really a waste of time if you don\u2019t have a laptop and thought you could use your phone with an adapter that it doesn\u2019t have. Black mark when trying to project and a bad annoying fan sound. Not worth it. Save your money.UPDATE:So in my previous review I was unsatisfied with the projector I received. The company actually reached out to me to resolve the issue and took it upon themselves to replace the projector with an upgraded one. It came in less than 2 days. It still doesn\u2019t come with a screen but it did come with a projector stand and a lens cover that the previous one did not. The only thing I would say that\u2019s a con is that the usb and hdmi port are way too close to each other and it\u2019s hard to plug in both at the same time since it\u2019s so close. You have to push them in really hard at an angle which can cause damage to the port. That\u2019s why I gave it at 4 stars. It\u2019s also Bluetooth but I haven\u2019t used that feature yet so idk what it can be used for. Overall cool projector but they need to add space in between the ports or at least add a second usb. The quality of the projector is very clear.",

                "reviewText": "I can hear a rattling sound inside, never a good sign. The keystone wheel has a very small degree of rotation (it seems broken), the image wont focus completely, either the top of the image is in focus or the bottom, not both. Also it won\u2019t sit level with the tilt screw, it leans to the back and left on a level surface. Not my first cheap projector, first one I had problems with though.",

It doesn't have a \"sleep after X amount of time without video in\" feature, so the LED screen within started to go funny is about six months.I've moved it around a lot, particularly inside to out for movie night. Since it's small and easy to set up, it's easy to move around.If not for the lack of turn off after idle time, this would be 5 stars",
