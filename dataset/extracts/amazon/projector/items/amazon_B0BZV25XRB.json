Due to copyright issues of Dolby Audio, this projector does not support Dolby. If it has no sound, go to setting of your streaming device and select Surround Audio option as \u2018PCM\u2019 instead of \u2018Best Possible\u2019 to get sound.Since there are many problems with the wired connection of the mobile phone, the wired connection of the mobile phone is not supported. It is more convenient to use a mobile phone wireless connection.There has an air inlet on the bottom of the projector. Please avoid other objects blocking the air inlet during using the projector or it will burn screen black.The remote control needs 2 AAA batteries to start, our remote control does not contain batteries. If it still doesn't work after installing the batteries, you can pm us for a free replacement.Using the projector in a dark environment will get a better viewing experience.For office use, we recommend purchasing a more professional projector.It is not Android projector.There is no interface jack on the back, so it can be placed directly with the lens facing up to project up to ceiling.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this projector for a while before giving it a full review. I've tried many projectors before of varying quality and price and this has been an amazing projector for frequent use.Picture Quality: The picture quality is really great. The projector is very bright and the picture comes through well with this projector. Very impressed with the quality so far, there are also no dark spots, no bends, and overall no issue with the picture quality at all. It can also be stretched pretty wide and still looks very clear. Fantastic for an outdoor setup at night (I doubt it would be bright enough to use in the day).Settings: Great settings for keystone and digital adjustment as well as manual adjustment. Had no issues dialing in the right settings for the best picture quality.Connection: Allows for bluetooth connections and comes with many ports on the side which I prefer than having ports on the back. Having side ports means if I mount this device to a wall I will have an easier time with managing the wires.Speakers: Surprisingly good as well, these speakers are loud and can fill the whole room. Sound quality is not bad at all, I still prefer using my own external bluetooth speakers but the built-in speakers are more than serviceable.Latency: For bluetooth connections there isn't any noticeable latency, I've had a solid experience with the bluetooth so far. The latency between the picture and input is also pretty low. Which means that this projector is also suitable for casual gaming.Overall this projector surpassed my expectations in several categories and has been in use for over two months before this review without any loss in quality or problems with heat or noise. The projector is very quiet and does not get super hot. Great picture quality and delivers in all areas, extremely solid projector at an affordable cost.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars One of the brighter projectors we tried, but otherwise it's not much better than others",
                "reviewText": "We tried out about 6 different projectors in our search for a good projector for outside movie night and basement use (for the kids) and while this one had a few notable pros that set it slightly apart for the most part it's ultimately just average. This one also fell on the costlier end of the spectrum with little to show for that valuation except brightness.And to be fair, it IS significantly brighter than a number of others out there - which is good if you don't want to be forced to wait until nightfall outside or being forced to block out all the windows and shut off all the lights in the room where you're watching something. A projector being able to compete with ambient light and produce a clearly visible image while there is still light on around it isn't a talent often found in the cheap projector range this falls into.Most of the time these things cast an image which, in the presence of any competing ambient light, is very dim and hard to watch reliably which makes most of these little projectors poor choices for full-time home projector options.For us, that was mostly okay since we only really needed it for outdoor movie night and waiting until it was mostly dark outside wasn't a huge issue. Our other use case for it was in the basement for the winter months when \"outdoor movie night\" was the last thing on our mind (hello, Minnesota winters).In terms of interface, remotes, and bluetooth connectivity, this unit falls into the range of mediocrity with the rest. The bluetooth is significantly finnicky and (not surprisingly) either has to be an audio output or a video source input, not both at once. Not surprising, but it's not explicitly stated and based on the way the projector talks about its abilities, if you're not a big user of electronics, you might not know that's a likely limitation off the bat.If you opt for bluetooth video source in, whatever external speaker you use will need to use the aux output cable option (that cable you use to connect that phone of yours to the speakers in your car when you don't want to run down the battery using bluetooth), otherwise a bluetooth audio out option is available.All of this requires interaction with a menu screen using the remote or the on-unit buttons and the menu is pretty clumsy and the remote is VERY specific about where you need to point it at the unit to make it accept the button presses.***Overall Value***The picture might be brighter, but that's really the only advantage here and it's really not enough to justify a valuation of $200 (at the time of review) compared to others just like it for significantly less. It's on the upper end of the cheap projector scale, but it's a pretty low bar it's having to clear for that distinction.",

                "reviewText": "This was a game changer for me! I recently had a back surgery, so I could only lay on my back. This made it super hard to read books or watch tv because I'd constantly have to turn my neck. I used this projector to stream movies and shows onto my ceiling and it was PERFECT!! Picture quality is excellent and the sound coming from the projector was good enough! I'll hook it up to my better speakers later, but I am in love with this and will continue to use it in my living room on my big wall! You can use your phone to sync via bluetooth, but I found hooking up my computer to the projector via HDMI cord was the easiest way to watch all my paid subscription services. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "OK, have to be honest, it took me (and my friend) forever to set this up and I was initially going to give this a less than average review. When we were finally able to set it up correctly (the issues were due to our oversight), our annoyance turned into enthusiasm; this projector has great potential. It is of great quality and comes with a carrying case. It is big, but not overly so, and the resolution is good, with a good brightness level and there is no over-heating. I do not have a projector screen, but I have a great white wall in my basement that works perfectly for this. This also comes with the user manual and remote control.The projector does have WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, and is compatible with iOS and Android. Do note that it does have limitations when it comes to direct streaming. You cannot stream anything directly from streaming services; no Netflix, no Amazon, no YouTube or any other streaming service (due to HDCP protocol), and it does not support Dolby sound (due to copyright), however you can use a TV stick that allows you to view movies/shows from streaming services. Check the product details.Also note, I am no projector specialist or even mildly tech savvy. Since this is my first projector, I have nothing to compare this with, so in regards to the technical aspect of this unit, my review may be lacking in information. I can review the experience, the quality, the resolution, the sound, etc, and for right now (do note, my projector is still brand new and only been used a couple of times), this is passing with flying colours. My review may change if I encounter any issues with usage and time, or if I find it's lacking in certain areas or features. For now, I can only go with what's in front of me, and this is a good projector, and turning my basement to a movie theatre (or close to it) was a fun experience.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My daughter wants to have a birthday with her girlfriends. My wife and I were thinking about having an outdoor movie party and decided to grab the Touch projector. This isn\u2019t our first projector, but we are looking for an upgrade with our current system.The first thing you can\u2019t miss is the size of the actual projector. It has a good size to it, but it does come with a carrying case. On boot up you are greeted with a myriad of selections. First thing I tried was the Airplay feature. It did connect to my IPhone and I was mirror my screen. Unknown to me until I read the warranty section on screen, the projector cannot directly play movies from many streaming apps due to HDCP protocols. So you will need to connect a stick in order to stream from this device. Another interesting message states that due to copyright issues with Dolby you will have to choose sound options without Dolby. Be aware that it also says that the projector will be out of sync with frame rates below 60fps. Whew, just thought you should know!Next up was selecting the HDMI input to my Roger IPTV box. That worked no problem, I now have access to cable and all my paid streaming services. It performed great watching sports, news and movies. The sound is okay from the projector, I do find it needs to be turned up to a higher volume level. Depending on where you are watching your sports are movies you may need external speaker help. What I am really happy to see is both Wifi and Bluetooth capabilities. This is perfect for syncing one of my Bluetooth speakers to pump up the bass and volume to this system. The focusing of the lens of the projector is stiff and difficult to turn. Once it is in focus you get a nice picture on the screen. It\u2019s never going to replace your Smart TV, but it serves as a fantastic movie theatre outside. I do like the fact that the keystone correction can be done to all four corner through a menu. This way you can get perfect corners without turning a dial or sliding a manual lever. \u2705WHAT I LIKE: \u25aa\ufe0fEven though the projector is bigger than most, they do provide you with a carrying case. \u25aa\ufe0fBluetooth connectivity is great to upgrade the onboard sound. \u25aa\ufe0fWifi enables you to connect to Airplay (Apple) or Miracast ( Android). \u25aa\ufe0fWhen the Airplay is working is great to show off your pictures or videos from your Apple devices. \u25aa\ufe0fDoes not really get hot like other projectors, it\u2019s warm to the touch. (The front is the warmest spot) \u25aa\ufe0fThe picture quality seems a notch above other projectors I have used. \u274cWHAT I DON\u2019T LIKE: \u25aa\ufe0fNo onboard controls!\ud83d\ude33 You lose the remote and I have no clue how you could control the projector. \u25aa\ufe0fThe remote is not always responsive. The default volume was set to 100 and I had a hard time turning it down. Even moving from menu to menu, your experience some lag. You need to patient switching from setting and screens because I found the response delayed. \u25aa\ufe0fNo screen provided so you will need to purchase one separately or use a wall in your home. \u25aa\ufe0fAirplay is not always stable and does disconnect on its own. \ud83e\udd8bOVERALL:The Touch projector is a nice machine that would make any family happy. It has enough features that keeps it on par with the competition. The picture quality seems to be above the competition in similar pricing category.",

                "reviewText": "When I got this, I was expecting the average low cost projector. Flat colours, dull picture, lacking brightness unless in complete darkness. This unit turned out to be significantly better than previous units I've seen. Firstly, the colours are fairly vibrant. Secondly, the brightness is more than expected. You still need a darker space, obviously, but it's much more suitable in dimly lit spaces, outdoors, bedrooms, etc.. as opposed to totally dark areas.If I had a complaint, and it's the same for most of these devices, the menu's and UI are terrible. For me, not a problem, as I just plug a Firestick 4K into it, and use that instead. The actual controls and software are good enough, and allow you to control the functions of the unit easily enough. Keystone, flipping, etc.. are all easy to control.To add to this is a fairly good case that it comes in, as well as a solid remote, and some basic input cables, including a HDMI cable, and an actual AV cable. You should have no issues connecting most devices to this.Last point is sound, and I have virtually no expectations here, but it does have built in speakers. I don't recommend them, and would suggest you connect some external speakers, even via bluetooth if you can, to get proper sound.At the current price, without coupon, this comes in at around $200, which is not bad at all for what is a solid projector. I have an older higher end projector, which can just do 1080i barely, based on DLP, and the bulb for it costs more than this projector.",
