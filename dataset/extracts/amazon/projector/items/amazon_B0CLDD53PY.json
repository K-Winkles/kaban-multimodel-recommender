Connected to the phone with no issues. Screen quality and sound is perfect what we needed. Very satisfied with the product , i can suggest if you are looking something with good screen quality ,easy to install and carry wherever you go , i think you can\u2019t go wrong with this projector.oh and I forgot i loved how it focused automatically it is a great pro.",
