                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. NEBULA Capsule 3 Laser: Cinema in Your Pocket :)I, too, fell victim to the siren song of positive reviews. This mini Anker projector promised big-screen magic, and let me tell you, it delivers. My mind was officially blown the moment I held this thing. It's smaller than a soda can, but packs a punch that's anything but mini.Setting up was a breeze, thanks to the autofocus and auto keystone correction. No fiddling with dials, just instant cinematic bliss. The built-in apps are a bonus, though I admit I'm a sucker for the classics \u2013 Netflix and YouTube all night long.Speaking of picture, I was floored by the sharpness and brightness. My pitch-black bedroom became a mini movie theater, and even in less-than-ideal lighting, the 1080p resolution held its own. Sure, purists might crave an optical zoom, but for me, this digital one does the trick.But this Capsule is more than just a projector. It's a travel-sized party waiting to happen. The Bluetooth speaker pumps out surprisingly loud, crisp audio, turning any hotel room into a dance floor. It's not my primary speaker, but for impromptu jam sessions, it's a total win.Is it perfect? Not quite. The battery life, while decent, could be longer. And sometimes, the Android interface feels a tad sluggish. But for its size and price, these are minor quibbles.Overall, the NEBULA Capsule 3 Laser is a game-changer. It's a portable powerhouse that lets you take your entertainment anywhere. Whether you're craving a backyard movie night or a spontaneous rooftop party, this little projector has you covered. In a world of bulky electronics, this is a pocket-sized marvel. Highly recommended!P.S. Anker, if you're listening, a carrying case would be the icing on the cake!Bonus points: Laser technology means no bulb replacements, ever! Sleek and stylish design that looks as good as it performs. Perfect for travel, camping, or even impromptu presentations.Final verdict: 5 out of 5 stars (with a bonus star for sheer portability!)",

                "reviewText": "I am the one that always wants a projector, I searched a lot of brands from amazon and some research from google, I made my final decision to Capsule 3, Nebula. I can not wait to use it once I receive it. Here are a few points that I want to mention.This projector has very good clarity even with the lights on.We all know the best place to use projector is somewhere does not have much lights on, but I also want to use it at somewhere else, for me, I do not have a TV at my dining room, but my wife and I like to watch shows when we were having dinner, the phone was too small. so I tried to use the projector in my dining room and put the lights on as usual. We were all surprised that the projector was more than we expected.This projector is very light, I can carry it everywhere I want, I just feel like I own a carry on TV and watch it.The setting was easy and smooth, but you have to download a google home app in order to continue the setting. It takes a little bit of time to set up the system. I do not have to worry about the screen correction. It will automatically correct by itself no matter where I move my projector.My favorite thing was it does not need to use any cable to connect from your devices. All you have to do is connect it to the same WiFi as your devices.This projector does not make a lot of heat dissipation noise. The quality of the speaker was not bad, of course you can not compare this to other real speakers, it is loud and clear, but won\u2019t have a \u201cbuzz\u201d sound.It worth it.",

It took a long time (software and firmware updates galore) and was riddled with more than its fair share of \u201cwho \u2026 the \u2026 tested this stuff?\u201d. \u2026or more correctly, who DIDN\u2019T test this stuff. But, in the end, it just took some deduction mixed with patience and skipping setup steps to arrive at a device that was fully configured even though the setup process indicated otherwise.It\u2019s a google AndroidTV device. The speaker is adequate. You can connect/drive external Bluetooth speakers (I have mine driving a pair of Bose BT \u201cportable/soda can\u201d speakers). So, no big there.The laser performance in and of itself is really solid. It automatically focuses and keystone adjusts. Really good stuff there! Not enough output to work well a lit environment. But in a dark environment the picture is genuinely good. Resolution is 1080P. I only have good things to say wrt the display performance (lit environment meh aside).The first app I tried to install was Netflix. Netflix is pictured in the advertising and such but no. It\u2019s not pre-installed and NOT available.Everything else I wanted seems to be available\u2026 Amazon, Spotify, the crap apps from mainstream media. Even Apple TV! I installed Apple TV (no Apple TV+) and it found my iTunes video library and played a video in less than 30 seconds.-1 star for a crap-tastic setup experience and no Netflix. Otherwise, a really good product!",

I projected video on a white wall although I imagine this will improve once my projector screen arrives.Audio from the projector speaker was clear and crisp - perfect for dialog. Do not expect deep sub-woofer style bass from the built in speaker. The projector can be paired to a sound bar or such device for richer bass if so desired.The feel of the projector felt premium quality and had some weight which I like.I had the opportunity to contact Nebula customer support and I was very impressed with the prompt reply - (not your usual \"rubber stamp response\" directing you to a link that one is used to receiving these days).I got the impression Nebula customer care actually paid attention to my concern and recommended an appropriate solution in a professional manner in a return email.I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a qood quality portable projector with excellent customer service.",

You need to realistic with your expectations though, it's only 300 lumen.Image quality is perfectly acceptable 1080pBrightness is adequately within expectationsSound is again, adequately with expectations (haven't tried to use it as a Bluetooth speaker yet and likely never will, I have a Sonos move for that)Note: 5 stars value for money because I bought it for 30% off on Prime Day.Minor gripes I have are:- It's meant to be a portable device but doesn't come with a case or bag or anything to transport it.- I wish they had given is just a bit more processing power. The menus are slow to react and it feels mildly sluggish.- I have not yet been able to verify 2.5 hours of battery life but to be fair I have usually boosted the brightness to max rather than leave it in auto mode. ~1.5 hours so far is the best I've experienced with eth brightness boosted like that.",

The Nebula Projector is small and produces a massive display with little to no loss of clarity, especially with the autofocus feature. The brightness isn't a major loss in light and looks amazing in the dark. It's got a decent Bluetooth Speaker and the remote is easy to use (grandma tested).But there are some issues:- You can register Bluetooth audio devices but you can't select what Bluetooth source you want. The OS only gives you the option to rename or disconnect. This is difficult when you want to listen with earphones and when you disconnect the Bluetooth device it automatically goes back to the projector speakers instead of the sound bar. I would then have to re-pair the soundbar from scratch. It gets annoying.- Another problem is I'm unable to download Netflix directly to the Google TV screen. I'm forced to use a 3rd party app belonging to Anchor to access Netflix. I ended up using my BluRay player to get Netflix.- Last thing, it's more of an \"Ish-me\" not an issue: The angle of the projector; we have it above the bed facing a screen. The light is sent to the ceiling. We were forced to buy a mini tripod to angle to fit the screen right. Know that the Nebula is meant to be used at a lower angle.For what we need, the Anker Nebula Projector is a beautiful piece of tech. For this price, it's worth the purchase. Fix the issues and it's a 5-star for sure.",
