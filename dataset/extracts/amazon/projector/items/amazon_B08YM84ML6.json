                "reviewText": "So far I have no complaints about the projector. It meets my needs for sufficient brightness to be used in a well-lighted room, the color rendition is quite good, and it is very easy to set up. I do move it around some but don't actually travel with it so the fact it isn't the most compact unit in its class doesn't bother me. It is quiet in operation and doesn't overheat or even get uncomfortably warm; you can shut down and immediately slip it into its carrying case. I haven't yet used all the various input options but both HDMI and wireless connections are hassle-free. The little built-in speaker puts out adequate volume for small room presentations and sounds decent for narration. If you are reproducing music or a movie soundtrack you would want to use the line audio outputs feeding a better sound system.",

This does not quite have the resolution of my old projector, but it costs just a little more than a replacement bulb for it, so I am switching to this full-time.",

Unit does have HDMI and VGA along with USB, built in WLAN for casting using the Epson app. Super bright, and vivid colors.Really like the physical horizontal keystone slider, it lets me keystone an image almost 30 degrees off center and still have a good projection.Fan does run a bit loud, but if on Eco mode it's tolerable.",
