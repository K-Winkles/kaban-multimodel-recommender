                "reviewText": "This was very easy to assemble. I like that i can modify the height slightly as needed. The only complaint I have is that the piece that holds the phone could use more stability. The piece doesn't stay in place at certain angles and ends up drooping down because of the phone weight. Overall, it's a convenient item to have to do review videos.",
