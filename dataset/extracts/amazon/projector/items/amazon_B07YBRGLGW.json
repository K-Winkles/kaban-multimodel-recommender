The sound is very basic, typical of any projector in this price range, but this mini-projector allows you to connect to external speakers or headphones via Bluetooth. Operation is so easy and has a remote control (batteries not included). You can connect it to a PC/laptop (HDMI or VGA), mobile phones, flash drives, SD cards and use with an Amazon Firestick or similar. In short, it is not a projector for presentations, but it is a good projector for home use. High recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a few projectors over the years, this one out performs them all and is compact, lightweight, super easy to use. It can't weight more than a lb and is the size of a thick book. In seconds out of the box it was up. Hook a Roku stick to it and have all your stations. Bluetooth audio to whatever speaker or headphones you want--works great.Picture quality is solid 720p, good enough for sports and movies for anyone who is not a video snob (but then you wouldn't be paying just 60 bucks for a projector).As others have said, the thin screen/sheet they give you isn't the greatest. Works fine against a dark wall to brighten it up. But use a real screen, white wall, or thicker sheet and it's great.Brights are pretty good, darks are average. Like all projectors, low light in the room is best. But works fine in a bright room too for most normal sports/shows.Overall, love this. Super portable theater for the basement, garage, or outdoor parties.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1. Great picture.2. Lightweight screen easy to install.3. Decent speaker sound- better than other projectors I've used.4. Multiple sources and easy connectivity (TV, computer, wired speakers).5. Lightweight6. Small size easy to carry and store.7. Seems durable.Cons:1. Didn't come with tripod stand.2. Remote batteries not included.3. Bluetooth didn't recognize any of my Bluetooth speakers.Analysis: Works well with HDMI and plug in speakers but Bluetooth an issue. Not the end of the world but that just means I have to keep plugged in speakers near the projector. I've played around with settings but still couldn't connect. I may try other troubleshooting but as it's supposed to recognize the speaker's Bluetooth right off, I'll just plug in the speakers for now. Also, every other projector came with a tripod stand. This didn't. I'll have to use my other projector stand for this.Otherwise I recommend this cute little projector. It's not expensive and if you can work around the Bluetooth the entertainment value is worth it.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s all about the Lumens.!!I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase of the 2023 Upgraded Portable Bluetooth Projector. This device has completely transformed my home entertainment experience.First.. Because Amazon stocks this it came overnight, which means if you are planning a football party with a little planning you can have it on time.Second.. It comes with a screen, so while its bright enough to be shown on a wall, a screen will really make it so much better.Third.. This is so much lighter and brighter (and cheaper) than previous / other models. The technology has really improved everything and lowered the price.Fourth,. This takes every conceivable input that I could throw at it \u2013 HDMI, Chips, USB etc.. you can get data into it, and it will show it on a big bright screen. As I said its really about the lumens, think of it this way, its like having a room that is dark and choosing a 25 watt bulb ( competition ) or 1 100 watt bulb ( this projector ). The 50% brighter projection, thanks to the 5000:1 contrast ratio and 1080p resolution, enhances the overall visual experienceFifth.. The Bluetooth 5.1 chip truly delivers HIFI sound enjoyment. The built-in powerful speakers provide exceptional audio quality, creating a cinematic atmosphere while watching movies on a max 176-inch screen.Sixth..The added Bluetooth function is a fantastic feature that allowed me to connect wirelessly to my favorite speakers or headphones, providing a truly immersive and private viewing experience. It's a perfect way to relax and amplify happiness with this Bluetooth projector. The low noise fan is a huge plus,trust me on this when you are watching a movie a fan is the last thing you want to hear.In conclusion, the 2023 Upgraded Portable Bluetooth Projector has exceeded my expectations in terms of audio-visual quality, durability, and versatility. It's a fantastic addition to my home entertainment setup, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, feature-rich projector.This is great with a roku box or a fire stick, or just your plain old cable. The key here the screen is HUGE and whatever you watch you will feel like you are part of it.. and as a real big plus when you are done watching you can take down the screen and pack this lil baby up and you can have your room back.Just wait till you watch football on it\u2026 What a deal, What a picture, don\u2019t wait grab one for the holidays, or any day.. And enjoy TV the way it was meant to be LARGE and at a super reasonable price.. !!",
