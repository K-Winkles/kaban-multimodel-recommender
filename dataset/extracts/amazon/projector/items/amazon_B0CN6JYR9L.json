                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So, let me set the scene: I've just unboxed the DBPOWER Netflix projector, and I'm buzzing with excitement to get this bad boy up and running. Spoiler alert: it's a cinematic masterpiece in a box.Cracking open the box was like early Christmas. Everything was snugly packed with soft foam \u2013 talk about VIP treatment for a projector! The sleek carrying case was a cherry on top, not just fitting the projector but all its cool gadgets too \u2013 HDMI cable, power cable, a handy remote, and more. It felt like unpacking a treasure chest.The projector itself? A beauty. It's got this modern vibe with its black and silver finish that just screams 'classy'. Setting it up was a breeze. Screw on the foot, pop it on a table, and voila, my living room's now a mini cinema.The setup was a walk in the park. A few clicks here and there \u2013 choosing projection mode, language, and Wi-Fi setup \u2013 and I'm at the \"enjoying\" part. Yeah, the message could use a tweak, but the sentiment? Spot on.Now, let's talk about why we're all here \u2013 the picture. It's like butter on popcorn. It's crisp, the colors pop like fireworks, and the blacks? Deep as the night sky. Adjusting the picture to fit my screen was no sweat with the 4 corner keystone and zoom. And the built-in apps? Netflix has never looked so good.The main draw for me was the built-in apps. No external devices needed, just me, my remote, and a world of streaming at my fingertips. And yeah, while not every app under the sun is there, the browser is your golden ticket to anywhere you miss.I had a tiny hiccup \u2013 a bug decided to photobomb my movie night and got into the projector. A quick shoutout to DBPOWER's customer service, and boom, problem solved. They guided me through a simple cleaning fix, complete with a YouTube tutorial. MVPs, right there.In a nutshell, this projector is the real deal. It's got the looks, the brains, and the brawn to turn any room into your own private theater. Whether it's movie marathons, binge-watching, or gaming, this projector's got you covered. DBPOWER, you've outdone yourselves.So, if you're in the market for a projector that's a breeze to use, delivers stunning visuals, and comes with a side of excellent customer service, the DBPOWER Netflix projector should be at the top of your list. Trust me, your couch will thank you.If you want all the details, read on.What's in the box:The projector comes packed very secure within the box with soft foam that protects it from any bumps or bruises in shipping. The box itself is labeled with the specs and company information. The projector comes with a handy and very nice looking carrying case that has room for not just the projector, but also all of the accessories that come with it. The accessories include a user manual, a screw on foot for the bottom of the projector that allows it to be propped up at an angle if necessary, the remote control, a power cable, an RCA to 3.5mm jack input cable, and an HDMI cable. The remote has a simple layout that is intuitive with a power and input buttons, a directional circle with a select button labeled as \"OK\", back, menu and home buttons, as well as app launch buttons for Netflix, Youtube, Prime Video and a built in web browser.Projector layout:After installing the prop foot on the bottom of the projector, I inspected the how it was laid out and designed. Overall projector itself has a very sleek look mixing black and silvery gray.The front of the projector is very simple and has the lens on the left, which can be covered by an unobtrusive cap to protect it when not in use, and an IR receiver for the remote on the right hand side.The top of the projector has control buttons that include power, menu, select, back and navigational arrows. These are all that are needed to make full use of the projector and always are a MUST in my book for any projector. The top is also home to a manual focus that is easy to use and has smooth action. There is also a manual keystone wheel, but this does not seem to actually move. I suspect that it is either present for a situation where the 4 corner keystone is not sufficient, or is a relic from an older model projector that used the same basic design.The back of the projector has a grille for the built in speaker, and another grille for what I suspect is an air intake vent. The vent can be opened, and the grille cleaned, but does not provide access to the projector internals. Also, on the back is another IR receiver for the remote on the left hand side.The flat side of the projector has the heat exhaust vent along with the input and output ports, including a headphone output jack, the AV input jack for the RCA adapter, two USB ports and an HDMI port.On the bottom of the projector there are four rubber feet and a screw hole for the prop foot. Note that the rubber feet have mounting holes underneath them that allow the projector to be connected to a ceiling mount. Another thing to know is that underneath the center sticker is an access panel that allows access to the LCD and internal fresnel lens. This is rarely necessary, but if there is debris on the LCD, it can be removed using this panel and a cotton swab.The rounded side of the projector has only the power input and a removable vent.Initial Setup & Menu options:With the physical inspection complete, I plugged it in to my home theater and fired it up. I was greeted with a quick splash screen and a simple setup walkthrough. It first has you select which type of projection mode you want to use, offering standard front projection for the projector sitting on a table or some other flat surface, inverted ceiling mount projection, and rear projection options for both of these. I stuck with the standard projection since I was not mounting this in my theater as I plan to keep this one portable. Next you select your language, followed by region, then have a few notices to accept. You can quickly accept all of them, or view details to select only the ones that you want. This is followed by Wifi setup, then an option to sign in to Netflix, which I suppose is to be expected from a Netflix projector. Finally, setup is complete, and although the message has poor translation, the sentiment is nice. The message is \"The setup is completed, enjoying!\", but should probably be changed to \"Setup is complete, enjoy!\". Since the projector is able to have it's software updated, this could be changed in future versions of the projector or in an update for other projectors.After the guided setup, I had to make some adjustments to the zoom and 4 corner keystone to configure the picture to my screen. I have a 150 inch 4:3 screen, and had the projector sitting about 15 feet or so away (that is a total guess, as I did not measure it), so I reduced the size to get it to fit, and then scooted the corners around to line them up correctly. To adjust the corners, you cycle through them with the OK button. The currently selected corner has the dot on the rectangle in the image filled in, while the other three are empty. You then use the direction buttons on the remote to move the selected corner to the correct alignment. This was really easy to use and resulted in fantastic alignment and a great picture.Next, I checked out all of the menu options. There is one for setup, picture mode, audio, bluetooth, network, projection, keystone, zoom, and an \"about\".The \"Setup\" menu allows you to change the language, set the time, change the screen saver options, set a sleep timer, set the projector to sleep automatically, upgrade the software from a USB drive, check for updates over the internet, or to reset everything back to the defaults. I did run the software update, but the projector already had the latest software.The Picture Mode menu allows you to select some preset picture modes or to manually set values for brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, sharpness, gamma, and color temperature.The Audio menu lets you adjust the bass and treble or select a preset audio profile. This is not really handy for the tiny built in speaker, but might be for a bluetooth speaker or headphones. You can also set the digital output mode of the audio from the apps, and turn on dialogue enhancement. There is another option called TTS, which stands for Text To Speech, which is useful for navigating for visually impaired people.The Bluetooth menu is very straight forward and allows you to pair a bluetooth speaker or headphones. It might allow you to pair other devices too, but I did not try.the Wifi menu is also very simple and does exactly what you would expect.The Zoom and Keystone menu options let you access those features, which I already discussed.The About menu lets you access various device information, but also tells the device temperature.Video tests:After mucking around with the menu, I ran the projector through some standard video tests. There are some fantastic ones on YouTube that I regularly use. To view these, I used the preinstalled built in app. The first that I ran is an audio sync test. This has a bouncing ball and rotating pie and makes a beep in sync with the ball bouncing. Ideally, these are in sync, and with this projector and the built in speaker, it was perfectly in sync.Next, I launched a picture test video that has many tests built into a single view. A grid and circles allow you check that the keystone is correct, the color dots allow you to check the pure RGB colors. A color gradient lets you see if the color transitions are smooth. Squares transitioning from white to black through various shades of gray let you check the black levels. Parallel white bars that change size and distance to each other allow you to see the detail and sharpness of the projector and to check how much the white bleeds across pixels. Overall, the picture test looked very nice on this little projector!Next I played some high resolution, high color videos that come up when you search for \"video test\". These usually have some amazing looking video and I was not looking for anything specific with these, but rather just looking to make sure that the did in fact look great on this projector. Of course they did look fantastic and I wasted an hour watching random things. :)I wrapped this up by watching The Great Gatsby on Blue-ray. This film has some amazing photography that is very vibrant and is a good choice for testing out a projector and this one made it look fantastic.Built in apps:One of the main draws of this projector is the fact that it has built in apps and does not require an external device like a Fire Stick to watch Netflix, Prime Video and some other streaming services. In addition to the streaming apps, this also has an app store that has some games and other streaming apps. Not every video streaming app that US customers expect is available here, but there is a built in browser that allows access to any of these that support browser streaming.One thing to note is that the menu option on the far right of the bottom row that has four white squares in it provides a way to install Hulu and Disney+. Please see my video that shows how this works.",

The price is reasonable! The sound is great quality as well. I'm able to adjust the projector setting. I'm using a sheet right now as a screen. Comes with a nice case for it too! Definitely a great purchase! Very pleased!",
