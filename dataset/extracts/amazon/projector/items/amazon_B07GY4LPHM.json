                "reviewText": "I really love this projector. It took some adjusting of colors and brightness. I found a good scene that was bright and showed a sky in the background and adjusted until i had good color and brightness untill the whites were not washed out and i could see the clouds properly. Definitely took some tweaking. But the picture is great. In bright mode i dont hear the fan and its only about 12 feet from my couch. I cant stress this enough but use an ambient light reflecting screen. Its important. The screen is meant for only receiving light from below. So it shows the projector light but doesnt get washed out by the room lights. I have three large windows in this room and watch during the day with lights on and blinds open and can see the picture just fine. Of course it washes out a tad. But its very watchable. In the pictures added i show no lights on and my recessed lights on full. The color washes a tad but it looks great. If you take the time to adjust color, brightness, contrast and other settings to make it look right. You will not be disappointed. I am using a 100 inch screen and the projector only sits about a foot from the wall. I also use an apple tv for all my apps. I don't think the out of the box apps and connectivity is all that great. To get the best performance and apps, use a different streaming device. Fire tv or something. I also use a bose sound system. I have never used the speaker built in. If you plan on using a projector, you should use a receiver and external speakers and streaming device. Its going to give you the best sound and use of any apps you might want. The color and brightness are the best i have seen for the price sub 4k video quality of any projector i havr ever had. And i have had many. My old epson was very close, but was a ceiling mounted projector and i hate casting shadows on the screen. Adjustment to the screen is very usable. You have lots of options to get the picture correct and you can use screen shift if you need to use the projector at an angle. I do plan on upgrading to a 4k if i can find something for the right price that has this level of brightness. Dont hesitate to buy this projector. If all else fails, you have prime return. I hope this review helps you.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because my wife was tired of having a projector on a table in the middle of the room and a giant octopus of wires trailing from it.Picture quality is NOT as good as my previous Epson projector. Picture is a bit dark, blue, and under-saturated. I haven't been able to get to look much better by tweaking in settings either.Noise level is GREAT if you have run in economy mode. If you have it run in bright mode the noise is distracting, so I don't use it. I imagine electric bill would be higher in that mode too. A pity, because it looks \"good\" in that mode, and \"acceptable\" in low power mode.Startup time is fine. Projection ratio is good. Unfortunately if it isn't dead-center to the picture you want to project none of the keystone correction options really help. no matter what I did the picture was either skewed, crooked, or off center. Oh well. Just make sure you have space DEAD CENTER of where you the picture projected. This has been a real challenge for me with 9 devices hooked up to my home theater.Another item of concern: I live where it is very dusty and I had to frequently clean the dust filter for my old projector. I CAN'T for this one. There is no dust filter where indicated on the manual. On the OPPOSITE side there seems to be one, but there is nothing that opens up to access it. It appears to be PERMANENT with no way to clean it. I hope heat doesn't become an issue and cause damage with no way to clean the air filter.The projector also runs real hot out of the box even on low power mode, so be aware of heat flow and airspace as well if you don't want to cook your other home theater devices.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s true HD 1080P , setup was easy. Everything works, plays blu-rays in great detail, even streaming services look great, has an aux jack out for sound to a surround system if your crazy audio specific about your sound, otherwise it has an onboard speaker. Overall a great investment. Even plays 3D movies with a pair of DLP link Glasses, just make sure you have a 3D Blu ray media and a blu ray player that can play 3D.did not have the white around the LCD , that some complain about, where your picture on the wall ends and there would be slivers if light escaping around from how the LCD screen was installed in front of the lamp.I\u2019ve used it with a Mac, a PC, Apple TV, Google Chromcast, it just works. Do not expect a 4K picture from a 1080p device, cause 4K is like 4 1080p devices stacked around each other.You can use a silver screen to improve screen image, but a smooth regular white wall looks amazing too!I can have lights on in the room and it not affect the image, stays bright and crisp. But once you turn the lights off, the images get deeper and brighter.If your looking for a large screen, but don\u2019t want a Large TV, than I would totally suggest this.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a Polaroid UST. Not having a UST before, I thought the picture was decent enough; however thankfully, the Polaroid started going haywire within a month. Long story, but I bounced between a refund and a replacement. I chose the refund and took a chance on the Optoma. In short, I cant believe my eyes! The Polaroid was essentially at the same price point and the picture isnt even comparable-far superior. Also, USTs work best on fixed framed screens. I have a motorized screen (not compatible for USTs) and the screen waves with the Polaroid have been significantly reduced- to a point youd have to be a real audio visual snob to complain. My wife agrees! Its not just me: The Optoma unit is amazing! If a UST is on your wish list and youre not certain what you want to buy in the $1200 price range, Id recommend this unit 7 days of the week. My only complaint is the audio option. I had to buy a separate unit to manage the audio signal for my Roku. Im a cord cutter so getting sling is essential. The speaker on the unit isnt anything special. Overall, its awesome!!!!",

                "reviewText": "Excellent picture quality! I was a little skeptical when doing research, as I have a fairly bright room and was not going to be able to install a long throw projector. After going down the rabbit hole of looking for the best projector within my budget, I came across the GT5600. It met all my needs as a UST and I am thorougly impressed. The only only critique I have with picture is that the blacks tend to blend together but this is mainly due to light in my room during the day. At night it looks great!All in all a great projector!Pros:Super easy to set up - HDMI from receiver directly to projector and you are up and runningPicture qualityCons:Runs hot and is loud in Bright mode but Eco mode works fine",
