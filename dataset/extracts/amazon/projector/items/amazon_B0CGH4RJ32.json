However, it turned out to be just what I needed for our Halloween display.This is not the type of projector you would want for an amazing home or back yard theater experience. It is a simple low budget projector.Being able to cast from my device as well as being able to connect to a bigger speaker worked out great though. The picture was bright and clear being cast through the window at night. The Bluetooth easily reached an outdoor speaker.This would be a nice little portable projector to take along or gift for a student. It has a built speaker that is actually pretty ok. And it is inexpensive enough that if it is dropped, lost, seized by this new fangled over zealous fbi, or stolen that it isn't a huge loss.I will most likely purchase a second one to expand the display.",

Inside gets very dusty quick, it does have a removable dust filter, but i still have a lot of dust built up inside and its starting to effect the image and my house is super clean/nothing else is dusty like this thing... it sucks a lot of air through it. I can't find a way to open it up and clean it out yet, but not even sure if its safe to do so. Overall it was fantastic for about 2-3 months, and now its pretty ugly. I'd go with one thats easier to clean next time.",

                "reviewText": "For a cheap projector this works fine. It has the functionality that I wish some more expensive projectors have. The only couple of things that I wish this had was a brighter video, quieter fan although the fan noise is mostly covered up by the volume of the blue tooth speaker I have connected to it.I like the menu structure. Easy to set up and navigate.",

You cannot bring it outdoors or play it anywhere without wall outlet power--it does not charge. Hoping anyone trying to find a portable projector sees this so they don't make the same mistake I did.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical. My wife purchased a different brand projector from this one and had a bad experience. Not so with this device! The projector was packed very well, simple. Unpacking was a breeze. I like simple. You will need two AAA batteries for the remote. Hook up was intuitive. You basically plug it in, focus, and read the easy-to-follow on-screen instructions. First, I connected it to my laptop using one of the projector\u2019s two HDMI ports. I selected the input port from the on-screen menu. The device auto-interfaced. I like simple. I had a projected screen in seconds. The sound augmented my laptop's speaker system very well. My wife checked it out and was very pleased with the picture resolution. She brought out her phone and we Screen Mirrored, wireless. Photos and streaming. Again, selected the function, auto-interfaced. Simple. I can\u2019t ask for more than that from a device. Nicely done, and very pleased with this device.",
