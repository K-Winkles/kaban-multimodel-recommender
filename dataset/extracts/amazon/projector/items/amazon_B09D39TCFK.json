Either way they are both up there in price. Although I do really like the Wemax dice, and at first I thought to myself \u201cwow this thing is awesome and the speakers sound great, I don\u2019t think I need to even open the halo +\u201d but boy was I wrong.After testing both, there\u2019s just a few things that I can\u2019t live with out in terms of features and service. (Auto keystone correction, customer service )I\u2019ll write a list of things that I like better on the halo + vs wemax dicePROS of Halo+-sound qualityNow I thought the dice sounded great, but after playing the same audio side by side, the halo has a much more natural cleaner sound coming out of it, it\u2019s actually so much better i changed my view of the dice speaker and wanted to just mute it.- the remote control on the halo feels better in terms of \u201cclicky\u201d of the presses. Feels superior in quality and I do like that it\u2019s white, easier to find if misplaced.- picture quality 5%-10% better (not noticeable unless you really take a look side by side)-halo is slight brighter since the lumens are higher-halo has kick stand which is really helpful, more than I thought it would be.- BIGGEST PRO is auto keystone adjustment (MUST HAVE) after playing with this feature, I\u2019m in love, so much that this alone sold me on it because it saves so much time, it\u2019s smart and when you have kids that love to shake a table a bit, that can throw the screen off enough to bother you , and make you re adjust to perfection. With halo + , it\u2019s all done for you!-manual keystone on the dice was annoying because it just took way too long to get corners where I wanted them, with halo + it was much faster.-with halo I can stick in a fire stick and have it powered via usb drive (with wemax it said it isn\u2019t providing enough power, that I would need to plug the fire stick into an outlet, which defeats the purpose of being portable)Halo + pushes more power to the fire stick!Not only that but i needed a extension adapter because the shell of the dice restricted the fire stick to fit flush since it\u2019s pretty thick. With the halo + , I had no issues since the shell had no restrictions as it was flush.-OS on the halo + was 10-15% faster and everything just felt more snappy.-CUSTOMER SERVICE- I contacted Wemax dice and it took them a couple days to respond (only option is email) and they just kept asking for videos when I clearly told them the issue I was having, which is that the auto keystone wasn\u2019t working. Turns out, it didn\u2019t have one. Only the halo + did.With XGIMI though, they have a US customer care number that operates surprisingly later than most companies and you will get a live person, but even if you didn\u2019t, they emailed me back same day! Not only that they went above and beyond to take care of my needs. This to me was worth the difference I paid alone because I know that I won\u2019t have to worry about anything ever happening to my projector. They stand behind their product, they will go the extra mile for you, trust me they are just awesome!This started as me getting a portable projector because my wife asked for one for the family to watch movies outside in the back yard, to me getting really excited about my new toy. This thing has so much more uses than just a back yard theater, I\u2019ll be taking this thing everywhere I go. It\u2019s a portable 30\u201d-120\u201d tv when ever you want! Especially hotels for my business trips. XGIMI is an amazing brand that I\u2019m very happy to have discovered!Over all it\u2019s SO worth spending the extra $200 for the halo+ , I am a person that cares about the small details in tech and XGIMI NAILED IT on this projector! If you are on the fence, let this be your sign to get it, you will be much happier.",

                "reviewText": "The XGIMI Halo Plus Projector has genuinely transformed my movie nights and travels. It's not just a projector; it's a portable cinema experience in a compact form. The sound quality is outstanding \u2013 loud, crisp, and so good that I often find no need for an external speaker. However, should you want one, the Bluetooth connectivity is flawless.Its intelligent screen adaption technology is a boon, automatically adjusting the projected image to match your screen size. This feature, combined with the autofocus, ensures a vivid and clear viewing experience every single time. Everyone who has witnessed this projector in action has been nothing short of impressed.However, a few things could enhance this already stellar product. Firstly, the projector lacks onboard controls, making the remote indispensable. Lose it, and you're in a bind. A padded carrying case would have been a great addition, considering its size and the fact that it's meant to be portable. It's a tad bulky, but given the myriad of features packed into it, it's understandable.To sum it up, the XGIMI Halo Plus is a must-have for anyone looking for top-notch portable entertainment. I never leave for a trip without it",

The process to try and fix it was quite frustrating through their customer support. They eventually replaced it with one that works perfect and also gave me a 10% refund for the trouble.The projector itself has a fantastic picture; including during the daytime. I also bought a Roku stick so I\u2019m able to watch cable outside since Roku has an Xfinity app. I greatly look forward this summer for family movie nights outside!It has a Harmon Kardon speaker, but I used Bluetooth to connect my Sonos Move. It works fantastic and I\u2019m able to place the speaker directly behind my ginormous projector screen.",

The Android 10 operating system works very well. I only wish the battery would last a little longer (about 1 1/2 hours), but all in all this was a great purchase. I originally tried the Nebula Solar portable (another real good projector, loved the 3 hour battery), but I had a few minor problems with it, so I had to return it. But,. All in all, I\u2019m glad I ended up with the solar+, the brightness and color rendition is so much better. Get it!",

Parte de mi incertidumbre se deb\u00eda a mi inexperiencia con estos dispositivos; apenas los hab\u00eda encendido y apagado. Adem\u00e1s, mis \u00fanicas referencias eran los proyectores ocasionalmente usados en clases, que no me proporcionaban mucha informaci\u00f3n para tomar una decisi\u00f3n informada.No quer\u00eda desperdiciar mi dinero, as\u00ed que empec\u00e9 a investigar. Aunque llegu\u00e9 a comprender conceptos t\u00e9cnicos como la relaci\u00f3n entre los l\u00famenes y la nitidez de la imagen, me costaba visualizar c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda tener un proyector en mi propia casa. \"\u00bfOfrecer\u00e1 una buena calidad de imagen? \u00bfRealmente me ser\u00e1 \u00fatil?\", me preguntaba.Despu\u00e9s de mucha investigaci\u00f3n, descubr\u00ed que este proyector se destacaba como una de las mejores opciones en t\u00e9rminos de relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio. Me decid\u00ed a tomar el riesgo, y no podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s contento con la decisi\u00f3n. La calidad de la imagen es excelente y cumple con todas mis expectativas y necesidades.Contexto de UsoPlaneaba usar el proyector principalmente durante la noche, en reuniones familiares, encuentros con amigos o para disfrutar de una velada de pel\u00edculas y videojuegos. La habitaci\u00f3n en la que lo uso es bastante oscura, sin luz directa, y la superficie de proyecci\u00f3n es una pared blanca con textura.DurabilidadPor \u00faltimo, pero no menos importante, puedo confirmar que el proyector es muy resistente. Prefiero no entrar en detalles sobre c\u00f3mo llegu\u00e9 a esa conclusi\u00f3n, pero definitivamente puedes tener la confianza de transportarlo sin preocupaciones.En resumen, podr\u00edas encontrar opciones m\u00e1s caras o m\u00e1s baratas, pero si est\u00e1s proyectando en un ambiente con poca luz y en una superficie adecuada, te garantizo que tambi\u00e9n estar\u00e1s muy satisfecho con tu compra.",
