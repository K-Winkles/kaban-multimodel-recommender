                "reviewText": "The projector isn't quite perfect, but it is very good, and factoring in the the price I'd call it excellent. If there was an option to give fractional stars in reviews, I'd give it a 4.5 or so, but the price point made me round up rather than down.I reviewed a previous version a couple of years ago, and this is a significant step up.Image-wise, the colors are good, shadow detail is good, highlight detail is good. I watched a couple of episodes of tv shows, I'd previously watched on both the old projector and a decent quality TV and saw details I'd missed in shadows before.My only complaint so far is that the image is slightly less than perfectly sharp, but the only time I've found it noticeable at a normal viewing distance (across the room) is on text when using the projector as a computer monitor. I did find it usable as a monitor after adjusting my mac to a lower resolution, so I don't consider it to be a huge problem.I found set up to be easy. The autofocus works quickly. The menus are simple and reasonably intuitive.It comes in a travel bag, that seems reasonably protective.Overall I's say it's a great deal for the price.",

Bluetooth is on point matches the lips. And it's connected to my sound bar. My fire stick works perfectly. My projector screen is 120 inches and it's bright also you can adjust the personal color, sharpness, brightness and much more is a plus. The fan noise is okay that's with any projector you will hear the fan but you'll get used to it, also has a removable dust filter make sure you turn off the projector before you pull it out once a week also the inside it is sealed to reduce the spots on the lens hopefully by cleaning my filter and covering it I won't get no spots in the future. I also bought a cover for it for $10 on Amazon I'm very happy with this projector there's more extras also loaded with some apps but if you have the fire stick you don't need them .",

I use a lot of different models at work, and I\u2019ll tell you, this one is worth every penny for what it does!We used it for day projection and it did not disappoint. For movie nights, it\u2019s great. Really nice device.My favorite features: auto focus!!! Super large projection area. Good quality when projected from far (22 feet). Phone mirroring. No hassle hdmi connection.My wish list: apparently it does not support Miracast, so I can\u2019t project remotely from my Windows 11 laptop.Overall: I would recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "I love the auto focus and Horizontal keystone correction. You definitely need Horizontal keystone feature if you are placing the projector on side table. Most of the projectors come with Vertical keystone and lack Horizontal keystone feature. Please choose this projector if your can't place the projector straight in front of the screen. It runs Android TV and has lot of options. Very good brightness and picture clarity. Can watch movies clearly even when low lights are turned on. Customer service through Amazon and email for product service and accessories. Good Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity. Amazon fire stick works fine and you can install most of the streaming apps.",
