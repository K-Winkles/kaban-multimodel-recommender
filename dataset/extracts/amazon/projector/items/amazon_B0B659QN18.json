It was very easy to set up and we didn\u2019t need to purchase anything additional to get started. We projected it directly on our wall, which worked well. The colors are bright and vibrant even during the day. The resolution is crisp and quite impressive. The auto-focus worked well and is a very nice feature. I also love the loud built-in speakers. It also came with a carrying bag, which will be convenient when we use it outside in the future. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this projector!! Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I have and do own several projectors, I have worn out a Sanyo, and I currently have an Epson and a Dell at my work and a Viewsonic in a warehouse I have that I use to watch football games when I have a large number of guests over. Recently, my Viewsonic has been acting up (probably because it is not in a air conditioned space) and I feared it breaking in the middle of a game that I had guests for so when this one popped up as a suggestion in my amazon feed, it got my attention for several reasons. 1. As a backup / replacement, 2. This projector has built in screen casting over Wi-Fi for apple and android devices, 3. It is LCD and does not require super expensive and hot bulbs. and 4. Because of the price..So first off, I really did not expect much as I know this is an off-brand product and its claims of easy use and brightness.. I honesty expected disappointment and that I would be sending it back.. The projector arrived four days after I purchased it, for some 2 day delivery was not available in my area for this product. It came in a marked box showing its contents so I was grateful nobody saw it on my doorstep to steal... I opened the box and was first surprised that it came in a grey cloth carrying case which is not heavy duty and the handle was a bit thin, but it is better than nothing. The projector was nicely packaged and comes with a remote (no batteries) and a power cord.. I decided to skip the instruction book and plug it in without reading the instruction booklet which is actually written pretty well and has photos of setup steps. Within a few minutes I had connected it to my wi-fi and was casting photos and videos from my iphone on the kitchen wall a few feet away. The projector turned on almost instantaneously unlike my other projectors and was pretty quiet and surprisingly bright. I then tried connecting my phone through Bluetooth and could not get the video to stream, but upon further reading it appears that Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support video, but I don't know if this will change in the future, but anyhow Wi-Fi is just fine. I also went to the projector settings and was delighted to find it connoted to the internet to check for updates which is a great feature.The next day I decided to bring my $1,000 epson projector home from my office to see how the picture and brightness compared between the two. Forgive my bad photos and videos as I am projecting against a dirty garage door with the projectors sitting on a cooler. Putting the two projectors against one another I made these initial observations: The epson seems a tad brighter but the photo and video looked washed out compared to this Abooln. The Abooloon colors were much deeper and maybe a bit oversaturated, but I have not adjusted any of the color settings so I am sure a little tweaking would help. The Aboolon also has better resolution as my expensive Epson is only 1080P. I then plugged my Roku streaming stick in to the hdmi port and used the usb port for power which it does provide. Sound quality on the Aboolon is MUCH better and while I will be porting the sound through my AV system, this projector sound is great for business meetings. The Aboolon is slightly taller than my epson but not quiet as wide and deep. The quality of construction is good, but here is where the Epson comes ahead of the game.. The Epson is heavier and feels like a more expensive piece of equipment, as it well should for more than double the cost. One other thing that I had never noticed until I put these projectors side by side, is that my Epson has a border / outline that is quite bright and noticeable around the picture which is distracting now that I notice it......So , these are my quick thoughts for the short time I have tested it so far. I will be keeping this projector and if it holds up for a few years it will be money well spent and appears to be an excellent value for the price.. I have not had any interaction with the vendor so I hope they stand behind thier product should something go wrong and will probably be buying the extended warranty that amazon offers because it is cheap assurance AND I will be keeping the projector in a un-airconditioned space in hot and humid Florida..",

                "reviewText": "This is a regular size projector, not compact, but it is not heavy which I like. The box comes with projector bag, remote control but batteries are not included, Video AV component adapter cable, HDMI cable, lens cleaner and manual. Ports available include headset, AV, VGA, 2 HDMI, 2 USB and lan which is quite a lot and useful. The other cool thing that I like about this projector which is not mentioned in the description is it is auto volt, meaning this will work even outside US.This projector is amazingly bright and has good audio quality and loud enough. I've tested this around 2pm in a well-lit room and it is surprisingly clear. The main purpose that I want projector is to be able to watch movie so this will really work for me. I had a problem with the sound initially as when a movie is played in laptop via HDMI, the audio is playing in my laptop instead of the projector which I did not encounter when I was mirroring using a mobile phone. I've reached out to the seller and they provided me an instruction/settings which resolved the issue.Another feature that I like about this projector is it has +-50 4D/4P Keystone Correction which will let you adjust the angle of the screen. Meaning if you setup this in the ceiling upside down, this will let you adjust the screen angle through few tweaks in the settings. This also eliminates the limitation of where to place the projector as it can be adjusted easily. This is 1 of the feature I\u2019m looking for in projector because I have limited space in my room.Fan noise didn\u2019t bother me. WiFi, bluetooth and screen mirroring are easy to setup. Note that Netflix will not work properly in the mirroring feature but youtube will. Another note is there\u2019s no apps installed but these shouldn\u2019t be an issue if you use TV stick or use a laptop. Overall, this projector has the features I'm looking for within my budget.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing noticable was how clear the picture was from 6 ft and beyond. The projector connected easily to phone, just had to download EShare and connect the projector to the Wi-Fi.Youtube easily mirrored from my Samsung S7 tablet, playing a lovely oceanic scene on the wall that was gorgeous and high quality. It can mirror anything on your phone screen, even art projects, as a artist I find this feature extremely valuable.It even works on the ceilling, watching aquarium fish and beautiful sunsets on the ceiling was a magical experience.The projector also comes with a controller for easy access as well as has speakers with loud balanced sound and a headphone jack for silent listening.The coloring is excellent and it almost feels as if your in a movie theatre when you use this projector.The only issue i found was the update button because it would change the settings, forcing me to redo all of the settings.My rating for this projector is a solid 9.9/10 though i have never had a projector, it does not change the fact that i thoroughly enjoyed using this projector. This item is enjoyable and will make families smile, especially on movie nightMy family loved this wonderful projector, we are looking forward to using it for years.",
