                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I buy a lot of projectors and this one is one of the lowest priced ones I have ever purchased but it exceeds it's price for sure.First, about the price, WOW! Look, I get it, they have really expensive projectors out there that are brighter and have better contrast and color separation but you are not going to beat this much projector for $60. I have no shame in using this to entertain guest with a movie or a sporting event up on the big screen using this projector.It is pretty bright even with some sunlight coming through the curtains or with accent lights on in the room. I see no noticeable pixelation with normal viewing. I love the Bluetooth connectivity making wireless speaker connectivity simple.This projector has remote sensors on the front and rear of the unit which is smart and very handy.The attached pictures and the video show the projection to a wall in which you can see the textured wall in the closeup photo. What I found to be exceptional about this was the projector was bright enough that I had to get up close to the wall and look down the wall to even see the texture among the picture being projected on the wall.The picture of the motorcycle scene is being projected onto a screen and other than it being more white I cannot say that I would go to great lengths to put a screen up with this projector unless it was a really nice area and I wanted it to give off those theater vibes.I would and I do recommend this projector. You are not going to beat the price Vs. value of this projector and it is a multi-purpose projector for me and it will be used in many fun ways.It really does have everything you need to get going quickly including built in speakers. I only used them for a moment when I had not connected the bluetooth speakers when I first plugged it in. I will say that I prefer the external speakers, the built in speakers are just not able to give the stereo sound separation I like being so close to each other. I also really like my movies to be loud, these speakers would work fine in a quiet room like a meeting/conference room.I love this projector and I am very please with this purchase.",

You can project onto a blank white wall or white sheet and even onto the ceiling.I like bright colorful compact design. It stows away easily after use. You can use the HDMI to connect your laptop, phone, Amazon Fire stick, Apple TV and much more.The picture quality is clear and crisp and remains clear even when increasing the display size.The sound quality is good, loud and clear. I did not even need to use a Bluetooth Speaker for better sound. I enjoyed the Surround Stereo Sound option that makes you feel like you are in a movie theater.There is a low fan sound from the projector running, however it is not a nuisance.The projector has quick response time, warm, cool and cinema movie picture quality options. You can also share images and audio from another device.All in good, it is a good solid product at a budget friendly price!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This projector was a *pleasant* surprise! For the price, I anticipated .... less, overall. Instead, the projector turned out to be well-built, compact (yet substantial-feeling), and supports a variety of connection types. Not to mention, built-in wifi connection - perfect for a quick setup. Once you've set it up on your home wifi (needs to be on the same wifi as the device you're connecting to), you just set it in place, power it up, tell it you're connecting via Miracast, and then fire up your Miracast/screen mirroring on your phone/tablet/laptop... the projector shows up on the list, select it, and ... away you go. No worrying about cords or adapters or tangles of wires. Plus, the handy remote helps reduce clutter, and trips to-from the projector.And - especially for the price - it's nicely bright. I included a video of a quick test-set-up in my kitchen... middle of the afternoon, shades not even drawn ... and the video's still nicely watchable. Of course, in a dim room you can expect a more vibrant picture, but this is surprisingly bright and powerful and definitely doesn't need a dark room.The keystone control is simple and effective - you can be fairly well off-center and still get a correctly-proportioned image. Plus, you can invert the image - useful when you want to hang the projector from the ceiling - and reverse the image for a rear-projection setup.All in all - *love* this projector! Great bang for the buck!",
