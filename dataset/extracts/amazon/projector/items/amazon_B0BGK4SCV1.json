                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this mini portable projector and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. This projector is an amazing value for its price. It is incredibly easy to set up, and everything works exactly as advertised.The image quality on this projector is crisp and clear, and it works flawlessly with USB devices and mobile devices. I also had great success using it with a Chromecast stick, which was made even easier by the onboard USB port that I used to power the Chromecast.The only downside to this projector is that the sound quality is not the best. However, it does have a line-out which allows you to connect it to headphones, speakers or sound systems for better audio quality. In addition, it has a tripod mount which is incredibly useful for mobility and placement.One small issue to keep in mind is that this projector does not have a keystone adjustment, which may not be a surprise considering its low price. However, despite this, the picture quality is still great.What's more, this projector is also able to run from a power-bank, although the screen may be slightly dimmer to conserve power. This makes it a great option for outdoor activities such as camping trips.Overall, I have zero complaints about this mini portable projector and am even considering purchasing another one for outdoor use. If you're looking for a budget-friendly projector that delivers excellent image quality and is incredibly easy to use, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",

It\u2019s easy to connect my phone. it was easy to connect my hard drive, the only reason I gave a four star is because I cannot figure out how to work the Roku stick with it but I am confident I will figure it out. I can\u2019t wait to get the screen so we can watch it outside. I would definitely recommend this product. And the price just adds to it!!",

While it is able to maintain power using the USB charging cable via power bank, I have tried multiple ways to connect my phone to it, with no avail. I have bought several different usb-c to hdmi cables, etc, and my phone will not recognize it. I use my laptop instead, which is much less convenient while camping. Otherwise, this is a really solid purchase. Good quality picture and decent sound for a small group of people. The only other issue I've had has been with the remote not working after the first couple times, but the remote isn't necessary to use this.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a projector to create a wall mural, and I'm glad I was able to find one that was portable, easy to install, and came with various tools to use. It came with a wall charger, a USB chord, a remote control, and a bag to place everything in comfortable for travel and leisure. This projector can show a screen as big as a wall, and I'm please with how clear I can see the images. Overall, this works great with USB Drives and connecting from a computer. For me and my uses, it's been great and simple (I'm a bit old school, but for my needs, this projector is perfect!)",

                "reviewText": "Originally this little projector was great, easy to hook up, beautiful clarity, but it was short lived. I had it in use for a little more than 30 days and the video went out. Sound was great but just black lines for picture. Definitely not worth it if this is normal for the usage. This is what we use daily.",

                "reviewText": "I am impressed. This little projector is very well built and has everything you need in it for a simple projector.The image quality is 480P, but it looks a little higher resolution than that in my usage of it. The picture is plenary bright when used in a dimly lit room (running on the supplied 12v adapter). Note that image brightness is reduced when using it off of a USB power bank (to be expected).The controls are easy to use on the top of the projector and mimic 90% of the function of the included remote.The playback off of a USB thumb drive is superb. It so far has taken every file type that I have thrown at it and was able to play it back.The speaker is very good for a budget unit.Lastly the focus adjustments are simple to do but there is no keystone adjustment so it will need to be set accordingly to the surface (but keystone or any advanced adjustments is not normally included in a budget unit).I do wish that there was a lens cap included because it has a pretty big lens that can be susceptible to scratches.Overall I was very impressed with this little budget projector. It does everything you expect it to do for a projector of this cost, just a little better. I would recommend it for anyone that needs a simple projector for use with kids or maybe to travel in an RV with.",
