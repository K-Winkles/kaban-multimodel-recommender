If it has no sound, go to setting of your streaming device and select Surround Audio option as \u2018PCM\u2019 instead of \u2018Best Possible\u2019 to get sound.Since there are many problems with the wired connection of the mobile phone, the wired connection of the mobile phone is not supported. It is more convenient to use a mobile phone wireless connection.There has an air inlet on the bottom of the projector. Please avoid other objects blocking the air inlet during using the projector or it will burn screen black.The remote control needs 2 AAA batteries to start, our remote control does not contain batteries. If it still doesn't work after installing the batteries, you can pm us for a free replacement.Using the projector in a dark environment will get a better viewing experience.For office use, we recommend purchasing a more professional projector.It is not Android projector.There is no interface jack on the back, so it can be placed directly with the lens facing up to project up to ceiling.",

But beginning yesterday it\u2019s begun making this annoying loud noise. It\u2019s so random too. I turn it on one moment and it\u2019s perfect. When I\u2019m done watching, I turn it off and when I come back later to turn it on the loud noise will start and I have to turn it off. Very disappointing.",

The projector itself is kind of loud with its fan. But overall, a decent projector. If I were to buy another I\u2019d be looking for a quieter one for sure.",

Lo compre para el black friday y la verdad estaba un poco esc\u00e9ptico debido a que hay muchos proyectores con precios que var\u00edan entre los $100 y los $3000. La verdad este proyector OTOUCH esta genial. Port\u00e1til, de buena calidad, buenos materiales, buena imagen. Viene con su estuche y un peque\u00f1o tripie. excelente para tardes de pel\u00edculas o conectarlo al Xbox. Completamente satisfecho y lo recomendar\u00eda sin dudarlo.",
