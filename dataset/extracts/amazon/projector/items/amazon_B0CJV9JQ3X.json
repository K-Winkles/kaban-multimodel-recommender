                "reviewText": "I have used this so much since getting it. It can basically function as a TV because of the Android OS and I watch youtube and netflix on it all the time. You can also install Spotify onto it. Keystoning the projector was simple and I got it to cover an entire 12 foot wide wall basically. The image is crisp and visitors were pretty impressed with it. Unfortunately, it is true that you do need to darken the room significantly to enjoy a show to the fullest, but for me, I prioritized portability more.The speakers sound like you are listening from your laptop. It might sound like a nicer laptop with good speakers, but a laptop regardless. My friend brought over his JBL speaker that he got for a Benjamin to hook up to bluetooth and it was really noticeable how much more realistic and 3D the sound got immediately. It was not a big issue for me as I was planning to get myself a speaker soon anyway.The fans are fairly quiet. You can hear them, but as soon as the audio is going, it is drowned out.I do wish the power cord were a bit longer though.Overall, I am still extremely happy with this projector and it's been one of my favorite items in 2023. For that reason, I will give it 5/5.",

C: Conexi\u00f3n por cable directamente HDMI. Entre URL PC y el proyector funciona excelente, todo adecuadamente.D: lo m\u00e1ximo, conect\u00e9 Chromecast y funcionan todas las aplicaciones y la transmisi\u00f3n es muy buena tanto desde el PC como desde el m\u00f3vil.E: En todos los casos puse Bluetooth simult\u00e1neo para el sonido con un parlante y funciona excelente .Muy buen producto lo recomiendo",

                "reviewText": "Aubor Smart Projector was shipped fast. Packaged very nice and secure. Priced reasonably for the amount of features and its preinstalled apps ( such as Netflix, YouTube and more) . Love the compact size, which is perfect for travel. This compact size allows you to bring the home cinema experience with you where ever you go.Setup is intuitive and very easy to navigate on screen instructions via remote or smartphone.A few key points to remember are:-Built-in speakers are very good for an average size room but we will use the Bluetooth function and add external speakers for a full surround sound.-Best viewing is of course in a completely darkened room vs well lit room. If in a room during the day, sitting within about 15-20 feet makes viewing acceptable, otherwise close any/all curtains for best viewing. To make sure you get the best quality viewing use a screen! Cloth screens are ok but best are the pull down ones!-The FANS are fairly quiet but can still be heard if immediate area is quiet.-Keystoning the projector was simple-Resolution is good to very good depending on the distance you choose-Aubor provides 3 years maintenance and lifetime technical supportOverall, a really nice compact portable projector for the price to bring the cinema experience inside your home.",

                "reviewText": "Once I stole batteries out of another remote (somehow was out of AAAs), this worked well. The auto focus was a little challenging for me, but I got it to work well enough. If you don\u2019t have batteries for the remote, you will not be able to use this projector. I got it displayed on a large blank wall in our living room, but it would work equally well on a big screen, white sheet, or inflatable screen outdoors in the summer. It was relatively say to set up on my wifi and from there I could view YouTube videos and more importantly watch Netflix. I haven\u2019t tried any of the other apps yet, but don\u2019t anticipate any issues. We mainly use for Netflix. The built in speakers work well enough for indoor viewing - not sure if they will be sufficient when we move outdoors during nicer weather, but we\u2019ll see. There is also a USB cable and port as well as a hdmi port so you could conceivably connect other media to the projector as well. It also supposedly has the ability to use AirPlay, but I haven\u2019t tried that because it is easier to just connect directly to my wifi rather than waste my phone battery. Overall this projector is quick and easy to set up - as long as you have AAA batteries for then remote, you can be up and watching movies in under 10 minutes.",

                "reviewText": "We really like the projector especially for the price and it actually being 1080p with good picture quality. I like how all adjustments can be made from the remote, focus, screen size and so on. What I don\u2019t like is that it has a hard time connecting to my WiFi and staying connected, after the third try it usually stays connected. The other thing that\u2019s kinda disappointing is the only app that seemed to ever work was Netflix! We got this since it\u2019s a smart projector and shouldn\u2019t have to use a tv box with it, we still have to plug in our Apple TV or console if we want to watch anything other than Netflix on it. Oh having the thread for a camera mount on the bottom would be cool so you could put it on a tripod or screw it into other mounts on ceilings would be nice also.",
