It's been a fantastic addition to our cozy movie nights outside and I am looking forward to using it this fall. The clarity and vibrancy of the images really shine when the lights are dimmed. I've noticed that in well-lit environments, the image quality can be a bit compromised, so I recommend using it in a darker setting for the best results. The sound quality of this projector is another highlight. The audio is clear and does not garble dialogue. In terms of its design and build, the projector looks sleek and modern. It's compact, making it easy to carry around or set up wherever needed. The controls are pretty user friendly and easy to manage.",

                "reviewText": "I was most happy with the mini size as advertised. It has a decent enough picture in a lighted room. But you'll for sure get the best picture in a dim lit room. It has the all-important HDMI port to run your favorite gaming or streaming device. There's also a VGA port for any computer or other media device without the HDMI output available. I also like the ability to use the Bluetooth connection or aux to connect to an external device, though the sound is surprisingly good for its size. I'm so pleased by this one, I'm thinking about getting one or two more and gifting for the holidays!",

                "reviewText": "Smaller portable size, great picture once focused, has attachment hole for a tripod or stand. The orientation can be changed if on stand or mounted from the ceiling. Worked great with my Amazon Fire Stick (bought separately). Feels like I\u2019m at a movie theater in my own home. The sound is also great just from the projector and can be connected by Bluetooth to a speaker as well. Works best in a dark room as with any other projector. Very cost effective related to some other projectors I was comparison shopping against. Requires WiFi but was fairly simple to figure out the set up. I\u2019ve been recommending this one to many people.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The projector is pretty good. Picture quality is better than I expected it to be. Sound is decent. Some shows/movies can be fairly quiet. The reason for three stars is that they claimed to be able to cast from phone or other devices but that feature does not work. I contacted using the email they provide and received no response. I ended up having to take my chromecast and fire stick from my other TVs and plugging it in whenever I want to use this which is pretty inconvenient. I am debating returning the product since I paid primarily for the feature that does not work and I shouldn\u2019t have to purchase other products for this to work. Without the chromecast or fire stick plugged into it, the projector is useless.",

                "reviewText": "So, DJI sent this to me and asked that I review this product.I will start off by saying that for this price range this projector is awesome! Nice sharp picture, easy to set up and works well. This would be a great projector for family gatherings in the back yard.This past Halloween I used the projector to show some themed .MP4s on the screens of my balcony using a thumb drive and it worked just fine.So far, one of the issues I've had is that when streaming things from my iPhone 12 Max Pro, like from HBO Max or Paramount+, the video has an issue of not playing in landscape mode. It does work in landscape when I'm streaming YouTube from my phone.The speaker is adequate, however I would connect a Bluetooth speaker for a better dynamic range.I also think, and this is completely subjective, that it could be a bit brighter.I'll continue to use the projector and I'll update this review as needed, but over all, this is a great projector for the price. I works well, it's an easy set up - for me anyway.If you need a simple projector for everyday use, then I can recommend this one.",
