When imaging, all LED lights emit light, and the surrounding shell is dark and does not emit light. In this way, when the 3D holographic advertising machine is operated, the human eye will only receive the light staying, and the dark color and no light will be too fast to fail. Recognized by the brain, the display effect will only stay on the light displayed by the LED light, so that the effect of aerial imaging is realized, and then a 3D floating image is presented. The working principle of the 3D holographic advertising machine is mainly to use the persistence factor of human vision (POV technology), through one or several columns of LEDs densely arranged and then rotating imaging. In detail, the visual effect produced by light on the retina will remain for a period of time after the light stops working.",

                "reviewText": "WOW this fan is absolutely great, I love it. I purchased it hoping that it will work well, and it sure lived up to my expectations. The packaging box is nice and sturdy, the fan arrived without any damages. I was able to setup the fan on my wall without any issues. I was now time to setup the software, at first I contacted customer service because i didn't know the software was on the SD card, but they were very quick to repond to guide me in the right direction. The software was easy to install, including the wifi feature, i was able to create my own bin files and had the fan up and running. It is really beautiful, very bright, you can hear the fan but not very distracting. I love this fan, hope it lasts a long time. Good product, if looking for a fan I would recommend you buy this fan.",

                "reviewText": "You get what you pay for.The instruction manual tells you how to open the software, but not how to use it.Apparently the first step is to select the model in the dropdown menu at the top right. I got the 42cm model, which is model SD224, not that that's listed anywhere. I just tried all the options til one worked.Then click on the icon next to file encode, select the file to encode, select the destination file, and your file will be displayed in a little window with a red circle to select what area to display.Once the red circle is where you want it, click the icon again to start encoding. Another little preview window will pop up, then it'll go away and tell you it's done.Copy the resulting .bat file to the micro-SD card, and I deleted the rest of the .bat files on the card to make sure it displayed mine. Put the card back in the display, power it up, and it should work.Mine fails to initialize occasionally. Just unplug the power, plug it back in, and it might work.So, once you figure it out, it'll work for its one purpose - displaying a short video while making you fear for the safety of everyone in arm's reach. I plan to make a plexiglass box around mine.",

                "reviewText": "Saw the many positive reviews plus good references outside of Amazon. Product was in new condition without any problems when arrived, powered up immediately and started showing all the many 3d holograms. Now I have many more added from the 700 provided from the vendor free downloads.What you need to know is that the software can also be loaded on your PC and is located on the USB drive that is included (USB drive also has a micro-SD slot). It allows you to send files from your PC and put files on the micro-SD card (which then goes into the 3d hologram fan). Once you figure that out, it's fairly straight forward but you do need to convert the files to the right size of device type you purchased.for the smaller 3D hologram device which I purchased (16.5 inch), you have to select the correct input option within the software. Mine was F1 equipment type but works great every time now and now I wish I would've bought a bigger/better one for greater brightness and visual.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these fans thinking to hang them on a bare wall to bring some interest into an otherwise bland space. Once I received the fans the unboxing and initial setup was pretty simple. They come with a TF card preloaded with files that create holographic images of a dragon, butterfly, jellyfish, camera,etc. As they are from the factory the various images on the TF card are displayed one after the other. However, I did not purchase the two fans just to have a series of preloaded images be displayed overt and over. I wanted to be able to take my own images and have then displayed as a hologram.The instructions for converting an image into a file format which the fan can read and turn into a hologram are a joke. Partially in Chinese, the instructions are a jumble of confusion. I have a university degree, my brother has a Ph.D. and together we cannot determine the steps necessary to make the fans work as intended. Communication with the company in China gets a link to videos, again in Chinese, which must skip or omit critical steps because the image I have after following the instructions will not play as a hologram on the fan.I have spent at least 30 hours trying to get some use out of these fans but as of this review they are simply collecting dust on a closet shelf. My advice is unless you are extremely familiar with the file formats used by the fans, don't waste your time or money. You really do not need yet another useless product collecting dust on a closet shelf. And if you just have to have one, send postage and I'll give you one or both of mine. Love the idea of the hologram fans but hate the impossibility of executing it!",
