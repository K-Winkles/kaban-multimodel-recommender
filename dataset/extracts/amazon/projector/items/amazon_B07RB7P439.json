Does it work with USB drives? : It absolutely does! Just plug in your USB drive to the USB port, and the KODAK LUMA 350 will locate any viewable files, like photos or videos, for you to view. Does it support 4K? That depends. The KODAK LUMA 350 supports playback of native 4K videos in 1080p. HD videos will play in HD over a good connection (from your device to the source, and your device to the projector), but lower-quality videos will not upscale to 1080p. Can I download apps? Yes you can! The Android interface allows you to access the built-in app store and download your favorite video streaming applications, so you can play your shows directly from the projector without needing to connect a phone. What types of inputs are supported? The KODAK LUMA 350 can play files from USB or HDMI ports. Other video inputs (DVI, Display, etc.) will need an adapter (not included). You can also connect your compatible device wirelessly via Miracast and mirror your screen or cast via DLNA.",

It takes me so long to do this by hand, so it has really helped me get a clean drawing. The projector has a focus while that brings images into sharp focus, and I can project the image on a small or small or large canvas. The remote works well, but it took it awhile to pair up. The design of the project is beautiful. Definitely worth it.",

I now use it with my firestick and have 0 issues or complaints, the only quirk I have found is that the Kodak remote will turn the projector off but not on\u2026 not a dealbreaker. An amazing price point for picture quality, ease of use, sound, and customer service. If for some reason this one poops out on me I will absolutely be buying another ! Awesome, awesome, awesome.My expectations have been exceeded, I love this little gadget! Perfect for what I wanted\u2014 something user friendly, portable, with a good picture. For the size, I really don\u2019t think you can do better. The projector comes with apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Prime pre-downloaded. The speaker quality is great, the fan is a little loud but nothing you wouldn\u2019t expect from any projector. I have yet to try to use the HDMI or USB ports in that my MacBook needs an adapter but I would assume these work well. I love this little projector and cannot say enough good things about it!!

                "reviewText": "This device is very small and might fit in the pocket. Looking at it from that perspective, this is a wonderful projector. The picture is way better than the cheap sub 200 projectors even those with 1080p native resolution. The borders of the image is as focused as the center and video looks great. The problem however is with the native apps. The device seems to be underpowered to run them. I ran into frequent disconnections while watching YouTube or using screen share from mobile. Video lags and wait wheel appears or video freezes while audio is playing. This is not an issue if you use firestick via hdmi. However, when you use hdmi, you can't use projector Bluetooth for audio. You have to use firestick Bluetooth for that. The USB port was able to power the 4k firestick. The features include vertical keystone, which is nice but no horizontal keystone or zoom. The brightness, although mentioned as 200 ansi lumens, is at par or better than projectors with ~2000 lumens. Remote is limited to home button and volume function while using hdmi but otherwise works ok. App is a pain to use. Battery life is about 45min to 1hr. Also note that the native resolution is not 1080p or even 720p. Overall if your main use case is to watch short videos and can use it in the scenarios which avoid the above issues, it is a good projector considering the form factor.",

                "reviewText": "Straight out of the box it took a few hours to fully charge the battery. When I turned it on, the instructions were easy to follow and it was set up in no time. It is bright and shows clearly and even though I have a speaker, the built in speakers aren\u2019t too bad either. Both the remote (batteries included!!) and the iPhone app work great.The only small negative is that the fan is a little noisy, but that\u2019s the case with most projectors on the market.Overall really happy with my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I had really high hopes for this thing. I needed a portable projector that could wirelessly connect to my computer for presentations, and this seemed like it would go above and beyond my needs; but it turned out to be nothing more than an expensive paper weight. I was initially impressed upon opening the box and turning the device on. It had good picture quality, was already loaded with apps, and navigation was simple; but I soon began to find the numerous catastrophic issues. First, the settings pages feel empty. There are very few adjustments that can actually be made, whether picture or system changes; and this hindered me greatly when I came to the second, and biggest issue; it WOULD NOT connect to any computer wirelessly. For hours on end and over the course of multiple days I tried every possible combination of different operating systems and computer settings; nothing. I tried to research, but their documentation is as lacking as their settings page. They showed HOW it was supposed to work, but there was nothing about what to try and change if it didn't work. I attempted to do a firmware update on the device in hopes to remedy the issue; as these can usually be the cause of such problems. Upon updating the projector, however, anything that had previously worked ceased to function. The few settings there were would sit and load endlessly, and whenever I changed a setting (namely the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) it would load for a few more minutes, then change itself back; meaning it then became literally impossible to use. I tried to email support, giving them the exact details of what the issue was and everything I had already tried, but got a generic response back of \"It's probably a battery issue\"; which has absolutely zero to do with the issues I was facing. Thankfully, they did send a replacement device; but I had the exact same issues with that one, to a T. Aside from those issues, the apps could barely load and often crashed. The icing on the cake is eventually I gave up and figured \"Well, at least I can use it with a cable\". While the cable worked fine on my laptop, it failed to do so much as flash or make any sound when plugged into my coworker's Surface (which is the device it was bought for). I don't think this device could have worked any less, and I don't recommend anyone to buy it. If you're considering it for personal use; a smart TV would probably be cheaper and 100% work better. If you're considering it for business, don't; it isn't worth the headache.",
