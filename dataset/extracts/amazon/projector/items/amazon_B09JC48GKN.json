                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my third screen, all from different manufacturers and for the price I am extremely pleased. So much so that I'm thinking of buying a second to use as my mobile/portable screen so I can leave this one permanently assembled indoors. However, this is not a screen that can be left out in the rain or exposed to the elements for extended periods of time. One thing I did like very much about this brand is that the extending tripods feel sturdier than others I've bought and the poles are a heavier guage steel. It is easier to assemble with two people but not impossible for a single person to erect on their own. To assemble on your own just slot the crossbar through the screen and connect it to the tripods at half-height. Then slowly extend each vertical pole 12 inches at a time switching between the two. For indoor use if you don't have high ceilings you can shorten the height by not fully extending the last section of the poles. There is a little give on the top crossbar but that's expected since it's constructed of 5 interlocking sections that span almost 14 feet. The first time you put this together you'll be amazed, people forget a 150 inch image area is 12 and 1/2 feet. Though the screen does not come with weighted bags, you can purchase those from Photography Supplies. This will help with ensuring the screen doesn't tip inlight winds when used outside. The stakes and cords supplied would work as well but you need to attach those at an angle as if you were pitching a tent.For me this was a great value for money. The screen is reflective and really highlights the projected image. For reference I'm using a Nebula Mars 3 projector with 1000 ANSI Lumens and a 1080p resolution. The screen is wrinkle resistant, pulls tightly and adjusts via Velcro straps, providing a much better image surface than the photo backdrop or other screens I've tried. I did not have the same build quality issues others have experienced but I can only assume the manufacturer has been listening to feedback and improving their product. Really this is the best bang for the buck. I would buy this again.",

It definitely requires two people to setup because of its size and design. The second time we used there was a slight breeze and teachers were necessary as it falls very easily with and wind. The frame is not as sturdy as I had hoped and if you are not careful I could see it becoming damage. I think it could have been designed with a middle support. The screen its self is fantastic very light weight and can be used with either front or back projection. I am ok with our purchase but hope the company can improve some of the frame features",
