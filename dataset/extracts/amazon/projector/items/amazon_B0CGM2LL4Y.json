                "reviewText": "This is a nice portable mini projector, and it has transformed my movie nights and gaming experience. Nor portable like on battery but portable as in its light and it can be placed anywhere in the room, not just straight centered with the screen.I dont have any tools to measure but I played many 4K videos from Youtube and it appears to be 1080p native. The details are very sharp, much better than my old 720p Dell so I know this is for sure 1080p native. It supports 4K like all other One feature is its auto-focus functionality, which eliminates the need for manual adjustments. But keep in mind manul focus is not available physically or in the menus. Or maybe I couldnt find it. Everytime you move the projector it automatically adjusts.A second feature is auto keystone and screen detection which didnt work 100% for me. It does adjustment but I manually fixed it afterwards, I spec ially like the 4 corner adjustment which allows for micro adjustments and the lines at the end remain very straight (some projectors do this but the edge lines are curved like my BenQ and thats frustrating)When projector is off, it works as a Bluetooth speaker and has good sound and when works as bluetooth speaker it has RGB lighting on top which is a nice touch. I like using a sound system so speaker built in doesnt matter to me but if it matters to you its a feature, .The colors are 90% as good as my $1200 BenQ which is remarkable, this projector only costs $150 ish. Unbelievable how they can deliver this quality at such a low price, I would not rate it 5 star if this was $1000 but even at $300 this is a great deal. There are 3 color modes, Vivid, Standard and Cinematic. I wish we could increase saturation.I was able to project 120\" easily from 10.5 feet away with some keystone. Keep in mind the more you move the projector from the center of the screen, the smaller and lower res the image gets because of keystone'ing, this is a physical thing, not a technology thing so its always best to place the projector, any projector, as close as possible to line up with centerline of the projector.It has a USB port and I was able to play 2GB compressed 4K movies without any issues. Played very well, no frame skip etc.No Andoird OS built in, or at least its masked with their own OS that allows playing movies from USB and screen mirroring for Android and iOS but you cant install your own apps. Again doesnt matter I connect my own device and dont plan on using the projectors OSFan noise is avg, on par with my BenQ but the image is very bright, I was impressed how much light is shoots out. So makes sense to have loud fan to dissipate the heat.The best thing I noticed is that when you do keystone adjustment the area immediately outside the image (odd triangle shape) are still being projected (physical limitation) but dark enough not to be visible at all so there is no distraction. Think how OLED keeps pixels off, but this is projection so completely different , I have no idea how they block the light 100% (unless you crank up brightness over 60% which isnt good, makes it all colors washed out anyway.",

                "reviewText": "I got this after accidentally breaking the one I had before, and honestly, I'm almost happy it happened since this new one is so great!The projector itself is very small and compact. It could easily be taken with you to use portably and the auto focus feature makes that even easier. The auto focus is so so so helpful, rather then having to adjust it manually and change the sizing of the screen, it automatically detects the right size and resolution to put it at almost as soon as you turn it on. it even adjusts the picture to be right when the projector isnt pointing streight forward!other then the great auto focus, the image quality is amazing. Even with all the lights on, the colors are barely distorted and im able to see everything with no issues, much better then ones ive used in the past. If you use it correctly with the lights off too it looks almost exactly the same as a real tv screen!it was also very user friendly to set up, I had it working and connected to my computer within minutes of opening, no confusing setup process. this is a great projector, and I would definitely reccomend it",

However, it exceeded my expectations when I checked and tested the product. The picture is super clear and colorful, and the best part about it is it focuses by itself. No blurry mess! The sound is cool too, making everything more fun.What's really awesome is I can cast stuff from my iPhone or Android, and even use HDMI if I want. I can also mirror it from my macbook without any external cables. Plus, it's not a hassle to move around\u2014it's small and easy to set up. Seriously, it's my five-star buddy for movie nights and a game changer.",

                "reviewText": "I had been shopping around for a projector for a while. I wanted something with quality but not too expensive. It also needed to be compact and portable because I host many different events.This one has alot of features that appeal to me so I decided to try it. So glad I did! The size is just right. The picture quality is excellent! It gets nice and bright. The picture automatically adjusts to the size of whatever screen you project it to. There is an HDMI port where I can hook up my fire stick or Xbox. There is also a USB port where you can plug in an external hard drive or USB memory stick and play your media files directly from there. I really like that feature!The sound output from the internal speaker is good quality and the volume gets loud too. If that's not enough, there's an aux port where you can plug in an external speaker. You can also connect a Bluetooth speaker to it as well. Speaking of bluetooth, this projector can be used as a dedicated Bluetooth speaker itself. Even has rgb lights at the top!It doesn't come with a tripod but I had one already and this one screws into it just fine. I don't really have any cons. Maybe they could add some sort of strap to it that made it easier to carry.Well that's enough for now. I will update my review after I've had more time to use it. But for now, I'm happy and pretty sure you will be too!",
