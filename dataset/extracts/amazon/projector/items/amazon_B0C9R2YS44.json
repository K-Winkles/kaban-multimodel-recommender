                "reviewText": "We've used this for a month in a home theater setup with Mac Mini (for internet) and a DVD player. It projects on a large classroom-size screen in our living room. Audio is sent directly out of the Mac Mini to a state of the art sound system. The whole thing is rather impressive.But I digress. Optoma HD39HDR has nice, clear images and it never goes out of focus. The only thing I've found to be a problem is that when you are projecting in 4/3 aspect ratio for DVD and then go back to the 16/9 for internet, the color is all messed up, being to red and too rich. People all look like they've spent the night in a toaster oven. The remedy--just turn the projector off and after 10 seconds turn on again and it will go back to normal. I love the rather economical bulb which is supposed to last years. In the econ mode, which preserves bulb life, the brightness is just fine for our living room.Our previous Otoma projector lasted 10 years with c. 4-5 hours operation per day every day. I hope this one will be as good.",

This works when the lights are on in the room. I set this up in my garage where I had 4 LED shop lights and the light from the garage door on and you can still see the picture. Better if you can turn the light off directly above the screen, but usable if not. The picture is fantastic. I have it connected to a surround sound system so I cannot say if the sound is good.I have heard people talk to the fact that the fan is a little noisy in bright mode, but I changed mine to Eco+ and not only did the fan go almost completely silent but the picture barely dimmed. I keep it in Eco+ because I really can\u2019t tell much of a difference in the picture, and it is still very bright.Not 4K quality, but I doesn\u2019t really claim to be, but it is really good 1080P.See the pictures to show with 4 shop lights on, in the dark and then one to show the quality on a paused screen. There is no lag in sports events. All of the photos and the video are in eco+",

                "reviewText": "This projector is mostly quiet and looks good but do not be fooled by the 15,000 hr lamp life claim as I was. A year and 1 month after purchase the lamp crapped out. And guess what. The manufacturer only waranties the lamp for 90 days. I ran a little math and if it had been on for a whole year that would have still came under 9,000 hrs... so they might as well say it lasts a gigilion hrs if they dont have to back that up with a warranty right. I thought ahead knwoing bulbs are a projectors weak point and bought 3 years of extended warranty through Asurion. Short story. Dont waste your money on it. Long storry after jumping through hoops for them for about 5 hrs my persistance paid off and they emailed me a lable to send my projector out to get repaired. A week and 3 days later i received my projector back cleaned and with a note that stated \"customer must replace bulb\". Guess what. They dont cover bulbs. Isn't that great. Learn from my mistake. Know that, while the picture quality is good, you are buying from a company that won't stand behind their grandious claims. do yourself a favor and don't shell out the extra 50 some odd dollars for a 3 yr cleaning contract that takes years of your life due to the stress of just trying to get your warranty honored. IMHO Optoma and Asurion both suck and are permanently loosing a customer and gaining bad publicity.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this projector back in 2020 and have close to 4k hours on it so far. Here\u2019s a few things you should know before purchasing.1) When switching between apps, games, video source or even just clicking a menu or home button it\u2019s very common for this projector to pop up a blue screen for around 8-15 seconds. If you\u2019re looking for a very fast, smooth and top notch projector this ain\u2019t it2) the projector gives off a considerable amount of heat, I live in the desert and already have enough of that so I used a window AC unit to combat the additional heat3) it\u2019s a good projector, I\u2019ve used it on 20ft inflatable screens, big garage doors, large walls and most commonly my projector screen and it has always displayed a good image. I\u2019m very happy with the lumen output, refresh rate and easily customizable display settings but I have to say at this price point I do believe there are better options out there so I would urge you to keep looking.",

DETALLE: Miro una pelicula en modo eco+ con duracion de 2 horas, y la lampara dice que utilizaron 4 horas de vida , no quiero imaginar cuantas horas descontaria en modo normal. DETALLE No trae tapadera para el lente para cuando no se utilice. DETALLE, la lampara de repuesto no es muy economica. DETALLE no traia instructivo tuve que buscarlo en internet . Es tanto el brillo de 4000 lumens que ilumina toda mi sala de estar en modo eco+. Pinte las paredes de un color mas obscuro para no reflejar luz en la pantalla. Buen proyector, lo recomiendo.",

                "reviewText": "I spent a couple months researching the best 1080p projector for the money and after actually buying 3 other ones, this one earned it's place in my home. It had the best combination of quality, brightness, price, features and placement options for me.Picture quality is really good. I am projecting from 11' away onto 135\" gray screen in a semi light controlled area. Quality is awesome, really no complaints.The projector is quiet! I had bought the HD39DARBEE previously and liked it but it's color wheel make a high pitch noise and it had connectivity issues.The lack of manual vertical and horizontal lens shift makes mounting critical, but the zoom and focus are great and necessary for most people.I like.",
