It's easier to get it off if you adjust the focus knob so it pushes out of its recessed position. 2.Copyright videos like Netflix, Prime video and etc. need to be connected to a TV stick or HDMI cable to enjoy. 3.If there is no sound coming out, please turn off the Dolby audio of your TV stick. 4.Your understanding will be highly appreciated.",

I bought this after making the mistake of buying a mini projector off of temu (yeah Ik, it was awful what was I expecting..) but this one was much better! I got it delivered same day I bought it and immediately hung it up from my wall to watch some Star Trek! best viewed after dark or in a room with blackout curtains/no windows. The image quality is pretty good, you can adjust the tilt/focus using the little scroll at the top and the switch on the side. The fan is a bit loud, but the speakers still sound good and clear- it\u2019s just like a fan is on in the background. If that bothers you, it easily connects to other speakers, although I haven\u2019t felt like I needed them anyways. I\u2019m yet to see how it holds up overtime, but overall I\u2019m very pleased with my purchase!Also quick tip for my folks with no free space on their walls to protect on: hang a white bedsheet from your ceiling! It works perfectly as a projector screen.",

                "reviewText": "At $60 you can't really get any less expensive and expect much.It really couldn't be any easier to set-up. There is a power cord in the box and a remote to control the input, menu, and power. I was able to plug in to my home theater computer and the HDMI input recognized the source immediately.The projector is light and seems durable enough. There is a dust cap to keep the lens clean while transporting, the highest native resolution, and max support resolution is 1980x1080. You can watch movies/television via connection with a TV, computer, streaming stick, connect to your android or iPhone or video player. You also have the capability to view content stored on USB or Micro SD cards.The size of your image is solely dependent on your distance from the screen. While most true theater purists would tell you that any digital adjustment to the picture size invites picture imperfections, this is just a case where the picture options are basic. My theater screen is 100\" so I set the projector on top of my table to set the projector on and use the single height foot to angle the image up and correct with keystone, image is pretty good no complaints.I bought this for my granddaughters to watch their favorite shows.Would I recommend this? I would not doubt but depending on what you're looking to use it for. This would be a great way to keep kids entertained by hooking up a Wii or Switch. Also an affordable outdoor projector and for taking on a camping trip.Great little portable projector",

A c port HDMI converter is NOT included (purchase separately if the intent is to play content from a cell phone without something to cast to like a chromcast or fire stick.The unit is smaller than I thought which was a pleasant surprise. I've connected a chromcast and PS5 to the projector so far, and use a Bluetoothe speaker for better sound quality. I have not tested the sound quality directly from the projector.With the two year warranty I have confidence that any unforeseen issues will be addressed.Overall, I got exactly what I expected for a great price, my boyfriend and I currently fight over how gets to be entertained in the living room.",

                "reviewText": "I initially got this because it had decent reviews and I'll admit it was very inexpensive. Finally got everything set up with the Mount and screen and placed it like the instructions said for Best picture. I noticed there are lines that travel from down low to up high and offset the picture for a split second. Almost like looking at an object halfway through water. Unfortunately now that I noticed it I can't not notice it. And unless it is perfectly centered with zero keystone adjustment the picture quality is inconsistent from the center to the edges. Decent quality in the center and extremely blurry on the outside. Will be returning for a better product.",
