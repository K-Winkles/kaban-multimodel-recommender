                "reviewText": "I've got nothing but good things to say about this beast of a projector.The initial setup was a breeze. In less than 3 minutes it was ready to go.It has a pretty good brightness peak, sharp contrast, and solid colors. It is meant to be watched in a semi-dark to a dark room for the best picture quality. The resolution is FHD 1080p.Multiple inputs, 3 HDMI, 2 USB, VGA, AV, and AUX input.Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capable.Surround speakers, which get really loud. Built-in sound setting to control bass, treble, balance, etc.Built-in filter to keep out the dust from the venting system.Included in the box are an HDMI cord, AV cords, remote control, User Manual, lens cap, power adapter, and three different plugs for different countries.Overall, this is an excellent option for the moviegoers and entertainment buffs out there. With multiple input options to connect your devices, and great audio quality.*Update*The first projector I received was defective, the keystone dial was not functioning properly, and I wasn't able to focus the entire screen, only partially focused. I have ordered a replacement, and it was working fine. Until the dial stopped working on the replacement as well. The build quality on this projector is not that good. Lack of quality control. Look somewhere else, don't waste your money.",

Previous people had noted that you may get a unit (poor workmanship/quality) but it appears product may be okay if I get a good replacement unit. I will say the focus and tilt adjuster is not the best design. I was able to perform both functions but I had to resort to just turning the lens manually versus using the dial.I cannot attest to picture quality since 75% of my screen was not visible on the defective unit.",
