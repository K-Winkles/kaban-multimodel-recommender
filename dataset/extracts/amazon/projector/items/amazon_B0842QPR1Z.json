                "reviewText": "One problem I have is that I use this primarily from behind the couch, at about eye level. At this particular height (probably the least common), the image is projected too high for the space I want it in. The instructions say the project has to be fairly level when in operation (I think the allowable angle change from level is +/-15\u00b0). So basically it has to be at coffee table height or hanging from the ceiling.Bluetooth audio capability would have been nice.A larger range of screen sizes via the zoom function would have been helpful.More input options would have been nice too...it only has 1 HDMI port and nothing else. There is a USB power OUT port, but not sure what I would use that for...I tried to use it with a USB-powered speaker, and a loud piercing noise was observed.Overall, though, I love it. The screen is fairly bright even during the day. I am currently projecting on a non-prepped, light gray wall until a permanent solution is decided upon, and I am still amazed at the quality of the image. I may do nothing further as far as the 'screen' is concerned.My main reason for selecting this model was its 3D capability. It's outstanding, at least to my eyes. Again, I am projecting onto a light gray wall--I was wondering if the 3D would work at all but it does, fabulously. It has 2 3D modes (i forget what the second one is) but I use DLP Link mode and DLP Link glasses that I bought here at Amazon:-DLP Link 3D Glasses, ELEPHAS 144Hz Rechargeable Active Shutter Eyewear for Most DLP-Link 3D Projectors- Acer, ViewSonic, BenQ Vivitek, Optoma, Panasonic, Dell, Viewsonic (4 Pack)In case you were wondering, 3D DLP Link glasses sync with the images on the screen by a nearly invisible (to naked eyes) rapid white flash embedded in the 3D video. These should not be confused with 3D DLP glasses (similar name but without the 'LINK') which require an IR emitter pointed at the viewers to sync the glasses for proper 3D viewing.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Bright image, quiet fan, great projector",
                "reviewText": "Bought this projector to replace an acer brand projector with a failing fan motor. We have the projector in the family room and use it daily to watch TV programs and movies. On average it gets used about 15-20 hours a week.The projector is much quieter than any other DLP projector Ive owned over the years. In fact, even with a \"library level\" of sound, I can not hear it running at all when the projector is in eco/regular mode. When in bright mode, for 3D movies or gaming, a very modest fan can be heard but it certainly on par with any other comparable DLP projector.The thickness of the projector itself and also its depth front to back, is a bit bigger than others ive owned but only by about an inch or so.The remote is backlit when buttons are pressed which is a nice touch. The image is bright enough that I can comfortably watch tv with 4 60watt ceiling fan bulbs being on and the image isnt washed out, but of course this and any other projectors are designed to be used in low light environments, in which this projector has a superb image quality. Multiple digital adjustments of keystone, image position and digital zoom to make fine adjustments to image size and even can adjust the levelling of image if your projector mount is not level or maybe your screen masking is not perfectly straight. A two part adjusting lens lets you dial in the perfect image size for your setup too. This projector is for a throw distance of about 15ft max for a 100\" screen image. My throw is about 11ft from the lens to the screen and I have it projecting an image size of 110\" wide X 66\" tall.I havent used the 3D capability of the projector yet but anticipate the quality to be on par but perhaps even better as there are multiple 3D settings/options for the best experience using that mode just make sure you have 3D DLP shutter lens glasses.Overall, I am very pleased with this projector and would recommend it to others eapecially if looking to have a high lumen output that is for everyday use as a primary display in the home.I did purchase the amazon offered insurance/warranty based on service level and price alone versus cost of projector and its typical lifespan.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this based on all the marketing and reviews for this projector saying that it has very low input lag for gaming. That may be true, however there is a big caveat with this. Once I switched to the \"Gaming Mode\" to get that low input latency, projector removed all of my digital adjustments such as keystone and digital zoom.This means that for me to use this projector in its full, low latency mode, I have to position it EXACTLY to the height of the screen so that there is no keystone adjustment is needed, as well as as exact distance from the screen, to not need additional digital zoom. Unfortunately both of these do not work in my small room. Projector is too close to the screen even with the lens zoom all the way in, so I have to use digital zoom to shrink the image even further to fit it on the screen that I have. Also I cannot position this projector low enough to not require a keystone adjustment. Both of these make the Game mode useless to me.I understand that this is particular circumstances and not everyone will have these issues but it may help someone who is in similar situation to make a better decision.Overall projector is actually pretty decent. Picture is bright and clear. Watching on a grey screen boosts the contrast and with the blinds down it is actually a very nice picture during the day.Also I've been gaming on this projector and even without the gaming mode on, I honestly have no issues with whatever input lag it has in it's normal settings, so it is still very usable for me.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this projector to set up a home theater in my basement, and I am very impressed with the quality and performance of this device. The picture is bright, clear, and sharp, even in a moderately lit room. The colors are vibrant and accurate, thanks to the RYGCWB color wheel. The sound is decent, but I prefer to use external speakers for a more immersive experience.The projector is easy to install and operate, with a simple remote control and HDMI-Link feature that allows me to control the projector and other devices with one remote. The projector also has a fast response time and a game display mode that enhances the gaming experience. I have played several games on this projector and did not notice any lag or motion blur.The only downside is that the fan is a bit noisy, but it is not too distracting once the movie or game starts. The lamp life is also good, and I hope it will last for many years. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality projector.",
