The color balance is way off. The very poor optics make it impossible to focus all parts of the picture simultaneously. The mechanical keystone adjustment is just a horror. The projector reports that it is a native 1080p panel, but a close look at the images produced suggest this panel is way less -- I'm not even convinced this is a 720p panel to be frank.",
