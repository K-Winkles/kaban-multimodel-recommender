                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This projector is well made and has many features that I found very useful. I attached some photos for you to check closely the feel and look as well as some screenshots from the projector menus.The projector has very basic built-in stereo speakers but when watching a movie, I am glad it can connect and send sound to my wireless bluetooth audio system . In one of the photo I attached, you can see I tried with a bluetooth speaker and it works very well. This is a reasonable design because who would use the speakers inside a projector for watching a movie? If you don't have bluetooth speakers, it also has a 3.5mm audio output which is good for headset or audio system connection.The other feature that I use the most is the built-in screen cast. Once I set up the built-in projector's screen mirroring application to connect to my home wifi network, I can cast my iPhone/iPad screen to the projector using airplay. I don't have an android device so I couldn't test it but I am sure it also works. If you don't want to set up the wifi, a USB lightning cable can also be used to connect the phone to the projector. Casting youtube videos works very well, however I was not able to cast any netflix or amazon videos. This won't be an issue for me as I use apple tv for those.The built-in 8400mAh battery is one of the main reason I decided to buy this model. I tried to run on battery only and it lasted for a 2 hour movie without any issue. This is a great plus and I am looking forward to use it in summer camping trip.For video input source, this projector takes 2 HDMI ports, 1 USD and 1 microSD slot to play media contents directly from the projector . It also has a 3.5mm input for older AV. Besides using the screen casting feature as the source of content, I also can use an HDMI TV dongle which draws power from the projector's USB port.Other small details I found from this projector shows that the engineers did put lots of thoughts in the design. There are two remote sensors at the front and the back of the projector; There is a standard camera tripod mount hole at the bottom so you may put it on any camera tripod. The package also comes with 3 different AC cables for different standards. I am guessing they just wanted to make it easy when shipping to different regions of the world. There is also a hard on/off switch at the bottom to turn it off if you don't use the projector for a longer period of time.I put a video shot when the projector is playing some video clip. The background noice from the cooling fan does sound louder than it actually is. It can be quieter but you don't really notice it when you are further away from the projector and watching a movie.To summarize, this is a decent projector for family or kids use. Weekend movie night for kids or summer camping trip, when we can't even go to the movie theaters these days. We just used it for our weekend Friday movie night and my kid loves it. It is not a replacement of your regular TV or those high-end projectors, mainly due to the amount of lumens it delivers.",

                "reviewText": "I researched many projectors and this one seemed to check off all the boxes on my list.We set this projector up in my small dining room. It actually came with a background screen too, but we just used my vertical blinds as a background. A blank wall would work great too. We pushed the dining room table off to the side and got a bunch of blankets and pillows and had a great family movie night.The picture quality is great. It's crisp and clear whether you\u2019re using this to view Blu-Rays or stream movies, there\u2019s no issue here . There is a speaker built into the projector which works okay (it will get the job done) but we chose to use our own speaker connected via bluetooth instead.I think it's perfect size wise. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s either too big or too small. I bought a notebook attachment to add to my camera tripod and we have it set up right on there. Another thing im happy with was the fan noise. The fan on my old projector was quite loud, almost sounded like there was a hurricane in my house when it was on, but the fan on this projector is much quieter. It's barely noticeable.As far as imputs go, you pretty much have every port available on this projector. There\u2019s USB, VGA, 2 HDMI slots, and a micro sd card slot. There\u2019s no worry about having the proper port for whatever you\u2019re looking to connect to this projector. Because this projector has wifi, we were able to connected the Roku box to the projector and were able to watch movies from there on it too.This projector has buttons on the top for easy access or you can use the included remote control to operate the projector.And if you're looking to not have any annoying wires laying around, there is the wireless wi-fi option. It was quite easy to set up and then I was able to stream movies from my phone to the projector without any issues.Overall, im very pleased with this projector and its performance. From a quality/performance perspective, there\u2019s nothing negative I can say about it.",
