HDR content, as typified by UHD Blu-rays, uses a much wider color gamut than ever. When such content is projected on our projector with a wide color gamut, it is possible to richly reproduce colors that were difficult to reproduce until now, such as the gradations of the sky and ocean, the contrast of red roses or a row of fresh green trees. Essential all-glass lens to depict all the data in the 8K/4K images The high-end DLA-NZ9 is equipped with an 18-element, 16-group all-glass lens featuring a full aluminum lens barrel. To project high resolution 8K images to every corner of the screen, the projector incorporates five ED lenses calibrated for differences in the R/G/B refractive index to reduce chromatic aberration and colour fringing when lens shift kicks in to deliver precise reproduction of 4K- or 8K-resolution projection. Reliability-proved BLU-Escent Laser Diode for exceptional brightness and longevity The light source for these projectors is the latest blue laser diode BLU-Escent, which is featured in JVC projectors. BLUEscent technology has been adopted for home theatre projectors to achieve exceptional brightness and longevity of 20,000 hours*. Laser diode allows dynamic control of brightness to reproduce images that are closer to human perception. Combining the latest BLU-Escent package with the D-ILA device achieves detailed, smooth, powerful video expression. *In theory, this amounts to 20 years or more while watching a 2.5-hour movie every day. Unparalleled black level achieved through high contrast ratio and high luminance The 0.69-inch 4K D-ILA device and the optical engine employing a wire grid alone realize a native contrast of 100,000:1 on the DLA-NZ9. But on top of that, in combination with the dynamic light source control that automatically controls the output of the laser light source by analyzing the input video source, an astonishing dynamic contrast of \u221e (infinity) :1 has been achieved not only for the high-end model but for all models equipped with the BLU-Escent light source. The synergistic effect of the ultimate dynamic range created by the high luminance will allow you to experience impressive, high-quality 8K images full of reality.",
