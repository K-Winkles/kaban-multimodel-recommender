                "reviewText": "I'm not a projector expert but I have owned a few projectors throughout the years. My first projector was a Optoma 720 dlp. It weighed nearly 8 lbs and had manual focus and no keystone correction. It took FOREVER to get it just right. God forbid if someone moved it. But in those days, you would be wise to stick with the big names like Sony, Optoma, BenQ, Epson. Nowadays, these newer brands are breaking barriers. This is my second Dangbei brand projector. I purchased a Dangbei Mars 1080p last year and have enjoyed it. Now I am in love with this Dangbei Atom projector. lightweight about 3 lbs and compact about the size of a tissue box this thing packs a visual punch. 1080p is realistically all most people need as most streaming services still tend to stream in 1080p, great sharpness, the 1200 max lumens is bright -- decent daytime viewing and obviously even better at night with lights off movie watching ( my supplied sample pic was 100\" and it still looked fantastic) . I love the remote control because I'm used to amazon firesticks and it is same design. I love the fact it comes loaded with Netflix, Amazon, and Google/Youtube. This means no need to buy a separate firestick. Just connect to wifi and you have unlimited content.This was also the first projector that I did not have to read the manual to set up and use. Everything is intuitive and simple. It has autofocus and keystone correction (auto works 'okay' but you WILL need to manually tune for best picture) . And the sound...not bad. Definitely useable as a standalone if you don't have exterior speakers....the built in speakers are fine. One thing to note...some online reviews will show a tilt stand. The stand does not come with this projector (small bummer). So you have to make due --I put it on a box to elevate it. Positioning is very flexible due to keystone correction and the ability to shift the picture directionally so you many options on placement.What I would have liked to see: I wish it was cordless. That would have been awesome if it had a internal battery. I also would have loved to see the power brick inside the unit instead of outside but obviously that would increase the weight and size of the already compact footprint. Lastly I would love the autofocus and auto keystone to work better--it gets it close but you still need to manually fine tune to get it perfect. Overall impressions is that I am amazed at how far along Projectors have come. This thing is slimmer than a box of tissues, lightweight, tons of media and wifi built in, easy to use and set up, 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently picked up the Dangbei Atom projector and I\u2019ve got to say, it\u2019s been an absolute game-changer for my home cinema setup. Right off the bat, the 1080p resolution with 4K support blew me away. The image clarity and color vibrancy are just on another level, making every movie night a blockbuster experience.What really sets the Atom apart for me, though, is its brightness. I\u2019ve had projectors before where you\u2019d have to sit in the dark to get a decent picture, but not with this one. It cuts through ambient light so well, ensuring that whether I\u2019m catching up on TV shows by day or hosting movie marathons by night, the picture quality remains consistently impressive.The design is something else I can\u2019t help but praise. It\u2019s sleek, compact, and honestly, just looks really cool in my living room. Its portability is a big plus too. I\u2019ve moved it around the house and even taken it to a friend\u2019s place with no trouble at all.Setting it up was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of connectivity options. Streaming from my phone or laptop is straightforward, and the built-in speaker system, while not replacing a dedicated sound system, is pretty decent for what it is.All in all, the Dangbei Atom has exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s not just a projector; it\u2019s an upgrade to your entire viewing experience. Whether you\u2019re a movie buff, a gamer, or just looking for an awesome way to present visuals, this projector is worth every penny. Highly recommend!",
