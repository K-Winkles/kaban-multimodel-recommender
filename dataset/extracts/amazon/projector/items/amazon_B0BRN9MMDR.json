                "reviewText": "This projector replaced an older $1000.00+ Optima HD we had for over 10 years. The picture is twice the quality (excellent even at 90\"), the connectivity is easy and reliable, the bulb is LED and much cooler with a longer life rating, it has quite a loud speaker (although it appears to be mono) as well as alternate connections for audio, and the fan runs about the same noise level as our former projector. We have it ceiling mounted at 12 feet from the screen and the adjustment more than compensates for any 4-corner keystone corrections needed to fill the screen (90\" diagonal) at that distance (I had to reduce the picture size considerably). The downfalls are...There is at least a 1 second lag in sound if using the Bluetooth feature (although this seems standard across the industry). The software is a little quirky, but that hopefully will get better if they do an update. There is no auto-focus, but the remote focus works very well. The auto-keystone doesn't really work, but it's fine using the remote (it is automatic) and I only had to do it once. I will give it 5 stars as the picture is high quality and the features and function of this projector are well above what I would expect for a less than $200.00 unit. I would buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "I cant believe how far projector technology has gotten over the past 10 years or so. 10 years ago you had to spend almost 10 times this amount to get the same resolution and brightness.This projector rocks. Great picture quality, and sets up in minutes. I did calibrate the picture using the basic tools in the setup menu. I also changed the color temperature to cool, which brings out more of the blue tint in the image. Take a look at the pictures of this projo set up in a dark, and overhead lighted environment. In this test I was using a Tivo Stream 4k box and playing content both 1080p and 4k. Take a look at some pros and a few cons...PROS:easy set up. just hook it up to power and adjust focus.excellent picture quality at night (or light controlled room)very good picture quality with overhead light, and window open.off angle viewing looks great, and you don't lose any brightness. (see photo)sports with fast action looks smooth, no stutter or blurring.sound gets loud, but a little tinny.remote is easy to use - switches inputs fast.CONS:remote feels cheapremote needs 2 batteries (not included)the tripod included was pretty small.no carrying caseOverall, a very solid purchase. At this price, you cant go wrong. Will be great for those summertime late night movie nights on the patio.",

Advice on that..don\u2019t bother with cloth ones they are horrendous. I only mentioned that because people don\u2019t realize the quality of the screen is just as important as the projector itself. Now on to the projector..the specs were amazing, aesthetically it was beautiful and modern looking but the quality of the picture was absolutely terrible and most importantly the complete lack of setting to adjust the picture was non existent. So if you don\u2019t like the picture you see when you turn it on, don\u2019t expect to be able to adjust it (contrast ratio, brightness, colors, etc). I was in disbelief that a projector with such great specs, lumens and reviews ended up being so limited in functions and such a poor quality pic. Thats the exact reason I purchased such an expensive screen, so that I never needed to question the screen regarding the quality of the projector",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start off by saying for 150 bucks you have to know what you should expect. This is not a professional projector so you shouldn\u2019t expect it to look as good as a tv. What it does give you though is a cheap alternative to 1000+ dollar screen. Picture quality is ok. I\u2019d lean on the side of underwhelming. Keystone adjustment is limited. Focus is adjusted manually and is difficult with the projector further back. The biggest fault to this projector has to be the dust filtration. It just doesn\u2019t do a good enough job. As dust collects the particles get on the bulb and creates what looks like dead pixels. My fix to this was to take a used dryer sheet, fold it into three layers, and tape it to the air intake on the back of the projector. So far it has helped and I will update this if that changes. For 150 bucks it\u2019s aight. I would give 4 stars but I had to modify it to keep it from ruining its own picture quality. Also the projector menu is lacking. Remote does not include batteries, they are aaa",
