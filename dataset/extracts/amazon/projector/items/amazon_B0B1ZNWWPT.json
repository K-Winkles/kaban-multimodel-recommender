                "reviewText": "First projector, so I don't have anything to compare. Based off just this, the set-up was very easy. Plug & play. Placed the projector on a dslr tripod (for ease of leveling unit), & to test run the unit: 1) ran an hdmi from the computer (you tube videos) and 2) Fire Stick. Also purchased a pull down screen, 74\".Works best in a darker room, but with the blinds shut, the picture was still fairly clear during the day. Picture quality was impressive. The dial to increase the focus worked well. Again, 1st projector, zero expectations. The picture quality is really based on the quality of the stream (if that's your source). I only stream (amazon, netflix, discovery, u tube), so unable to comment on other modes of video sources. As other reviews mentioned, not as bright as say a smart TV, but I felt it was more like a movie theater atmosphere. Some will like it, others may not.The sound was OK. Not stellar, not the worst. It was not muffled, was able to hear the dialog. The blue tooth matched up instantly to my mini portable speaker, so no issues there. There are sound settings that do help to make it louder than the default.The portability of this unit & ability to do an outdoor movie is a bonus.Overall, for 1st projector, I'm impressed. Small footprint, decent picture quality, easy set-up, and Bluetooth. The Eh? Sound. I recommend Bluetoothing to something better. Unit seems to run hot after about an hour. I did run it for 3 hours straight with no issues, but only time will tell.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was a little surprised when I opened up the box. Inside was a full color owners manual, HDMI & analog cables and remote. I was also surprised to see that it has a threaded hole in the bottom to mount it to a tripod(tripod was not included, but it will mount on any standard camera tripod). This is also a nice looking projector. It had a carry strap too!. It has nice lite up touch sensitive buttons on the top that operated most functions. The remote is basic, but functional. One thing I will say is that they did a great job with good instructions. As you can see in the pictures, the manual and on screen instructions walked you through every step with setup. After we downloaded the app and setup our Android phone(compatible with Apple as well), we were able to stream directly to the projector with out any issues.Picture quality: We used a Roku 4k HDMI streaming stick, although this projector is not 4k. It has a solid picture at 720p. It did a great job with live streaming. The frame rate was smooth and it didn't seem to have any of the poor choppy frame rates that I've had with other projectors in this price range. It also has decent stereo speakers. Loud enough to get the job done. There's a headphone jack on the back. You could plug in some external powered speakers for better sound. One last note was the fan noise was noticeably quieter than some of the other projectors that I've owned. Good thing! I hate loud fans!All in all, if your looking for an inexpensive portable projector that's easy to setup, this is a solid choice. It would be great for a backyard BBQ, watching a game or setting the kids down in front of it with there favorite show. Note: You will need an external source to plug into this projector (like a Roku or Apple TV) or stream from your phone or tablet. This is just a projector. No tuners or streaming apps built in.",

Small and lights definitely portable. Has sd slot which is great. Have loved using this product as a family",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Excellent value projector. Incredible for the price. Easy to set up using the very responsive remote control following a very clear instruction manual. And I found navigating through the various sound and video menus very easy. Lots of different options. I plugged in my firestick and was pleasantly surprised at how good the picture is. The small video I shot was taken on a very sunny day with curtains closed and as you can see it is very clear and visible in hd. When switching on the projector you can hear the fan,but once watching something with volume I don't even notice it. Hopefully you can tell from the video. I would recommend this projector without hesitation.",

J'ai achet\u00e9 ce videoprojecteur car il me semblait plus maniable et facile a transporter (notamment en camping) que mon 9000 lumens.Alors les questions que l'on se pose tout le temps sur ce type de produit :-luminosit\u00e9 : largement suffisante jusque luminosit\u00e9 moyenne. En pleine journ\u00e9e en pleine luminosit\u00e9 il est normal que nous ne voyez pas grand chose... C'est un vid\u00e9o PROJECTEUR. Si il y a trop de lumi\u00e8re il semble \u00e9vident que la lumi\u00e8re projetee soit plus difficile a distinguer... Mais rassurez vous. En utilisation \"normale\" il fait du tr\u00e8s bon job.\ud83d\ude0a-Le bruit : pour avoir eu d'autres videoprojecteurs je le trouve tr\u00e8s silencieux. Avec le son vraiment on y fait plus attention.\ud83e\udd17- Ensuite, \u00e0 savoir si il est natif 1080/720p.. Franchement ... On parle d'un videoprojecteur d'entr\u00e9e de gamme... \u00c7a sert a rien d'\u00eatre archi pointilleux! Il lit les 1080p sans PB, l'image est vraiment excellente mais apr\u00e8s, voir si c'est en natif ou pas. Ce n'est pas ce qui m'int\u00e9resse sur ce type de produit vendu \u00e0 ce prix perso. Vous pouvez mettre 100/200\u20ac de plus si vous avez certaines exigences dans ce type de produit.En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 j'ai trouv\u00e9 tout ce que je cherchais sur ce videoprojecteur.J'ai vraiment apprecie le plastique bross\u00e9 (contre les marques de doigts et rayures), reglages de l'image complet (zoom, nettete...)et surtout la tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9 d'image et de son.Je vous le recommande sans h\u00e9siter.\ud83d\ude09En esp\u00e9rant que mon commentaire vous aura \u00e9t\u00e9 utile \ud83d\udc4d",

Premetto che avevo gi\u00e0 un proiettore pi\u00f9 alto di gamma prodotto dalla stessa azienda, che tuttora utilizzo e trovo ottimo.Ho deciso di provare anche questo, date le dimensioni molto pi\u00f9 compatte e la praticit\u00e0 della presenza di wi-fi e bluetooth integrati.Come si nota da foto e video, il dispositivo svolge egregiamente il proprio dovere: nonostante le dimensioni ridotte del proiettore, l'immagine \u00e8 piuttosto nitida sia al centro dello schermo che sui bordi e negli angoli, i colori sono pieni e con mia grande sorpresa anche l'audio integrato, seppur certo non potentissimo, risulta apprezzabile.Molte le regolazioni possibili sia per immagine che audio, presente l'italiano per i menu, comodo e reattivo il telecomando.Utilizzato come si deve, cio\u00e8 con la giusta dose di buio e alla distanza corretta dal muro, risulta molto gradevole e permetter\u00e0 a chiunque di crearsi un piccolo angolo cinema ad un costo irrisorio.A proposito: io proietto direttamente sul muro pitturato con normale pittura bianca; certamente utilizzando un telo specifico o verniciando il muro con apposita pittura da proiezione i risultati sarebbero ancora migliori, ma per quanto mi riguarda ritengo la resa gi\u00e0 pi\u00f9 che buona cos\u00ec.In definitiva lo consiglio.",
