I've liked my previous Epson but I was getting to where I'd want to read some of the smaller text on the screen and 720 just doesn't cut it.A lot of the other reviews are right though..... it's about twice as loud as my older machine. That's a drag, but I think I can live with it. I only just bought it, so we'll see. Also don't know how long the bulbs will last. The older machine has been good. Only had to replace a bulb once in about 5 years.The other thing I've gotta say though is that it suffers from modern simplified code that forces a monitor presence if you connect it to your computer (via HDMI anyway). This caused the computer to BSOD crash. My older Epson has a manual monitor source connect setting, so the computer lets it go gracefully when I turn it off. This one digs in and holds on as long as it's plugged in, whether it's switched on or off. And even when there's no power with the HDMI is still plugged in, it holds on, and the Desktop still thinks there's another monitor, so your mouse arrow can go sailing into the ether of a phantom desktop screen. This does have a source connect button, but it still jumps ahead and connects before asked, and stays there.Other than those things, it's fine.",

                "reviewText": "This projector exceeded my expectations. I needed a projector that would be bright enough to use with a lot of ambient natural light as well as lighting for the room.As you see in the photo, I teach classes outdoors, sheltered by my garage, with a tent to extend the teaching space (behind the view of this pic). So whether high noon sunshine or after sunset dark, I need the projection to be clear from the front to the back of class. And it is! Very bright. And I have it set at 50% on Presentation Mode.It has WiFi built it. So devices can connect directly. I have an old Apple TV connected to play movies or YouTube selections. DRM protected video will not play directly off your device. It requires a laptop.It\u2019s full HD. My old one was very bright with HD, but nowhere near so bright or sharp as this one.Split screen feature is nice.The audio is lacking. But you can use a Bluetooth speaker. I connect the audio directly from my laptop to the Bluetooth speaker. I can also set Apple TV to choose the same Bluetooth speaker by default. The projector does NOT have Bluetooth. But if your device/laptop DOES have Bluetooth, you\u2019re all set.It\u2019s also quieter than my old projector. And lighter. Less heat blowing off it too. All the kids instantly saw the brightness and sharpness as they walked up to class! And I don\u2019t use a proper screen! It\u2019s a textured extra wide shower curtain that fits the width of my garage to both hide stuff behind it and serve as a projector! It would be even more amazing on a proper screen.",

The image shows up bright and clear even with full lights on. Of course it's best in a completely darkened room but this one does very nicely for what we use it for. It is wireless and uses Miracast to wirelessly project photos, slides, etc. You cannot use Miracast to project copyright movies so don't be disappointed if you can't play a favorite movie off your phone or touchpad. You can play movies you took. You will need another stand-alone device for that. You can plug in direct using HDMI and play your movies. I'm not a terribly fussy person and so I think the picture quality is great. The colors really pop, too. Setup was no issue for me but I do this all the time on multiple platforms so I'm a bit biased on that opinion. I've had no issues with this projector and have been using it for a couple weeks.",

                "reviewText": "Ive been using this for bit now, trying to really get a good judge of it compared to my LG ultra short throw projector and ive been really impressed with it overall. It has great video with very vivid colours, a good sharp resolution projection and multitudes of connection options.While this is a business projector, it does function pretty well and surpasses my LG on all levels apart from this being a long throw projector. The business projector basically means that they cut the contrast a bit, and made the light brighter for presentations in a fully windowed room... As such this is really best suited for a meeting room but also functions well for an entertainment unit in the living room during daytime hours. If you want a home theater experience, you're best bet is an actual home theater projector such as the HC2100 which isnt as bright but offers more contrast and is a designed for a home theater experience.Setting the projector is pretty straightforward, connect the power, hdmi cable to your computer or dvd player, turn it on and setup the tilt, skew ect. It does offer full control on the image left, right, up, down, upside down and also allows you to set the exact corner of your screen so you get the full view. It works well, nothing different from most other projectors above the 400 dollar price.The unit is quite compact, taking up roughly 12 inches wide, 10 inches deep and 4 inches tall, but be sure to leave space around the sides and back for the exhaust. The exhaust fan on eco mode is barely audible but on normal mode its comparable to a laptop fan when on full blast, quite noisy. The controls are easy to understand, remote offers easy navigation and you can literally aim the remote anywhere in the room and it will work, no need to aim it at the unit.The colours are very vivid, even more so than the monitor im using to type this (B286HK), however I don't think the colour accuracy is too realistic.... But good luck finding and projector that claims this. The dark levels are somewhat disappointing, definitely not the darkest blacks ive seen, a mere dark gray on any active iris setting. The brightness is very bright normal setting, more than adequate to have open blinds on a sunny day. On eco mode you can see the screen as well but it the colours and screen are not as vivid, for obvious reasons. In comparison to my other projector, this is heads and toes above it in all accounts.The sound, while adequate is only sufficient for basic sounds, such as a tv show but dont expect to be able to watch an action packed movie with it. The sound is pretty good for any projector that ive heard though, but the best comparison I can give you is by hooking up a cheaper bluetooth speaker(like 30 dollars cheap).... the bluetooth speaker is better, so thats what ive been using connecting the computer sound to the 3.5mm jack on the bluetooth speaker.... The projector lacks bass and mids but highs are clear and crisp.Connectivity has been pretty good overall, but the real thing ive found is the wireless casting is jumpy and inadequate for video. Its really only to be used for presentations and pictures, even standard def video is jumpy and skips with the wifi router in the same room. The rest of the connections work well though.There is really only one complaint I have with this projector, that is that it produces a distinctive sound, a faint but audible high tone, mid tone and low tone that repeats, it sounds similar to a ballast going bad in a fluorescent fixture. Its louder when the projector is cold and nearly goes away when its been running for 15 minutes but still audible. When the videos sound is going, you cannot hear it but when browsing the web you can hear it from about 5 feet away. It gets annoying...Anyways, its been good so far as long as you keep everything above in mind. As ive said, its not a theater projector, but one designed for use in day light or lit up rooms. If you're looking for a home theater projector, there are more suitable ones available.",

                "reviewText": "The EX9220 is an excellent business projector. It has excellent Colour and White Brightness at 3600 lumens, and good contrast at 15000, which is more than enough brightness and contrast for any room, regardless of how bright that room is to start off with. This projector also does quite well as a home projector too, but arguably has a much higher brightness then would be required in most situations at home \u2013 essentially, for the home, you be better off opting for a cheaper less bright model, such as the Epson Home Cinema 2100 1080p projector which performs just as well in the home for half the price. The brightness and contrast are really overkill for the home environment, so you only need to step up to this model if you really need that extra brightness to light up even the brightest conference rooms \u2013 read floor to ceiling glass window conference room. a, if you're looking for a high end home projector, there are also other models that cater more to that environment that this model does \u2013 ones that are less bright, have better black levels, and have quieter cooling fans. At lower brightness levels, there fan noise is not n issue, but once you cranked up, fan noise becomes clearly audible. As you might expect, cranking out 3600 lumens, can generate a lot of heat.The projector also has all the necessary connections you'd expect, as well as built in speaker which is fine for small presentations, but you'd be better of jacking your source into rooms audio system if you're looking for quality audio. In this regard, remember to run your sound/hdmi to the sound system first, then to the projector, and not the other way around (This unit does not have dedicated audio out ports) This is to be expected with most projectors and should not really be considered a negative.This projector resolution is 1920 x 1200 WUXGA which is a fairly standard laptop wide screen resolution, and is idea with wide screen 16:10 ratio presentations (which is somewhat standard these days). The projector is also capable of your standard 1080p 16:9 ratio to, which is what you'd be using if want to uses it in the home environment.Performance \u2013 crisp, clean, good colour preproduction and very bright. (That's the difference between a quality projector and those cheaper non name projectors) Setup was easy, menu systems are well laid out, and the wifi miracast connect worked smoothly. The bulb is rated for about 6000 hrs, or 10K in ecomode and it's replacement costs a reasonable $70. The inclusion of a case as also a welcome addition with this unit.Recommendations \u2013 highly recommended if you need a quality business projector. Don't fall prey to those cheaper no name projectors who's stats are misreported, and resulting image is dull, faded and washed out. If you're looking for a home theater projector you can probably find something for half the price \u2013 such as the Epson Home Cinema 2100 1080p.Really only have one criticism \u2013 for some reason they opted to include an outdated vga cord instead of an HDIM cord \u2013 strange choice given most modern laptops don't even have a vga port anymore.",
