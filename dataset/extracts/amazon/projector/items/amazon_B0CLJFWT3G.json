                "reviewText": "This Projector is so easy to set up and use. Just remove from the packaging box, install 2 AAA batteries into the remote control (batteries not included). Plug the power cord onto the projector and into a surge protected power source, aim the projector at a flat white wall or screen 6 to 11 feet away, within the focusing ability of the adjustable focusing lens and turn on the power switch on the top of the projector. You can read the options on the \"screen\" and use the remote control to choose input settings.10 minutes from opening the box and viewing your source image on the \"screen\" (Screen not included) via HDMI connection. (HDMI to HDMI cable included.) I used a USB-C to HDMI cable to connect my computer to the projector. You can use the Wi-Fi option to set up a connection to your network, which takes just a little more time. The remote uses infrared technology and so the remote must be pointed to one of the two receiving windows in the projector, one on the front and one on the back. (Don't try pointing at the Screen) The projector is best used in a dark room or at night unless you have a reflective screen. If you test out on white drapes like I did then you can expect a little distortion if the drapes have pleats. (Amazon has many screens to choose from.) The VIKEYUNVK projector is exceptionally bright for its compact size. You can use the headphone jack to access the HDMI sound or use a Bluetooth speaker. directly from the source like I did with a laptop. This is well worth the small investment, and I would rank with the higher priced projectors. It is very portable and has a leather carrying strap. The fan makes minimal noise when running and does not distract from the movie or video presentation. I will be buying more of these soon. Don't pass it up!",

                "reviewText": "This little powerhouse of a project is feature rich, yet affordable. Within five minutes of plugging it in, I was wirelessly streaming video from my Windows 11 PC to the projector. After turning it on I focused the video using the small knob on the top of projector to make it nice and sharp. Then, after putting 2 AAA batteries in the remote, I found the settings menu to adjust the trapezoid setting to make it a perfect rectangle. While this no doubt would work fine using the HDMI port, I wanted to challenge it with wireless video. After connecting the projector to my WiFi, in Windows under \"wireless display\" it recognized the projector immediately as a mira cast device (see pic). Once that was done, I was able to have it as an extra display to play video anywhere in my house over the WiFi network. I'm looking forward to putting this through more paces, but based on what I've experienced so far, 5-stars!",

After looking at various of projectors that was listed, I found this model to be the best price for the picture quality. The specs that was posted was very competitive to those found on high end projectors. I found this projector to be very affordable, portable, and user-friendly, which exceeded my expectations. Bluetooth function is useful and receptive. Menu is simple to understand. The compact design and lightweight is definitely a perk, allowing for easy portability. The built-in speakers deliver clear and immersive sound. Good construction. Very happy with this purchase. Overall, the Vikeyunvk projector provides a top-notch cinematic experience.",
