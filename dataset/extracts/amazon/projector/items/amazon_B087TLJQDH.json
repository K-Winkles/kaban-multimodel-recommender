                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Went shopping for a 40 in. Smart TV and ended up with a 100+ in. projector, and couldnt be happier.",
                "reviewText": "True Native 1080p, it actually projects a 1080p quality image.Excellent purchase for the price against other potential options in both flatscreen tvs and projectors.First, Ill get the few minor cons out of the way.The light source is not \"replaceable\", as they are in other higher end units, but not a huge issue due to being LED and should inherently have a long enough life span, should.There is no option, other than warranty voiding disassembly, to clean the internal mirrors or lens and the rear filter does little to \"filter\".The filter plate is the same material as most AC units use, so anything less than hair will get through and onto the lens causing what appear to be smudge spots that can not be cleaned from the outside and will show up on bright or white heavy pictures.The outside lens can easily be superficially damaged when cleaning if not careful. Nothingless than a brand new, or never used on anything else, microfiber cloth and EXTREMELY GENTLE pressure is required to clean off the exposed lens without any scratching.A quality optical cleaning kit specifically made for projectors should be used, products for cleaning high-end cameras or hunting scopes could probably be used as well without issue.NO ABRASIVE SPRAYS OR MATERIALS SHOULD BE USED.But those \"cons\" really arent too much of an issue especially for what you get in return. Above all the picture quality is very good both with color brightness and contrast from blacks and whites, UI is very easy to setup and use, built in speakers are decent enough to enjoy without an external sound system or even headphones.The multitude of connection options and compatability with other devices is nice and the cooling fan isnt much louder than a standard PC fan. It isnt whisper quiet at all and TVs dont have fan sound issues so it may take some getting used to any sound at all but its not a jet turbine handling a overclocked PC, and when your watching something with sound it really does fall into that realm of unnoticable.This is a perfect \"entry\" level projector for those looking to get into the projector world and stay with for quite awhile.If you're a smoker of anything, use essential oil diffusers, have pets, live in a dusty area, or practice cutting drywall as a hobby just beware of potential excessive dust build up on the internal lens.Dust can and will affect the picture quality much more and quicker than a regular tv though.I could go on about this and other features but I'll just say this.The picture hovers around true native 1080 when projected onto a $20 fabric movie screen through a decent internet wifi connection through a firestick streaming youtube videos.It may not be a crystal clear OLED and it definitely isnt eyewatering 4k, but for sub $300 I have a true 1080p 100 in. screen with decent sound.I have yet to try it myself, but videogames seem like they would look great from watching said youtube. Sound lag, refresh rates, and other issues with MIGHT affect online play but for single player games it seems to be spectacular. Movies, horror game playthroughs, 4k walks of Japan, and nature/space galleries all look amazing both in picture quality and sheer image size.Anything comparable televison wise wouldve been ridiculous both in price, space, and justification.One of the few non-essential items I've bought and continually pat myself on the back for the decision.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Image Quality",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros:I have tried many projectors in this price range and this had the best image quality of any of them: Very sharp, very bright, with realistic colors and contrast. You can see in the photos that the screen is bright enough to see with the lights on in the room as well.The interface is very straightforward and easy to navigate. It can be linked via bluetooth to an iOS or Android device, but I used it with a google chromecast into the HDMI port. Unlike other projectors I have tried, this one doesn't have built-in apps. I actually appreciate that because I have always found those to be difficult to navigate. I much prefer the simpler interface.The screen is bright enough to be visible with the lights on in our home. The image quality is very robust. I have used other projectors which over-saturate the colors, and that is not the case with this one.The packaging was impressive as well. It comes in a nice carrying case.This is a good projector if you are planning to install it in one fixed location. I don't recommend it as a projector you move around, as it doesn't seem to have much flexibility.Cons:There is limited keystone correction, only +-15 degrees, so make sure you are planning to install it at roughly the same height as the projected image. I tried having it on a table and projecting up at an angle, and I found it difficult to get the keystone and focus dialed in. It also seemed like the keystone created some uneven focus across the image. Some further tweaking will be necessary to get the image focus consistent.Overall:If you are planning to install this projector in one place and leave it there, this is one of the best projectors for the price that I have used. If you plan to move the projector around, or need more keystone correction, try another projector. Bottom line: the image quality is great and the interface is easy to use, so I recommend this projector.",

                "reviewText": "PROS: At this price point, the Artlii Energon 2 is one of the best projectors I have researched, reviewed, or used. The picture is bright, the resolution is sharp, and unlike some other projectors I tested with flimsy switches and focus controls, the Artlii Energon 2, is a mechanically well-built, sturdy projector. The software makes it easy to set-up for various inputs, connecting to a wi-fi network, mirror a cellphone or IPad, and connecting to a bluetooth speaker. Mirroring of mobile devices works well, displaying personal photos, videos, or business presentations.CONS: Unlike much more expensive projectors, the Artlii is not a \"smart\" projector with video streaming apps pre-loaded (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, for example). It is also not like a HD TV that is HDCP-enabled, (High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection), so you CANNOT mirror, or even stream through a hard-wired HDMI cable, any copyright-protected video content from a mobile phone or IPad. The only way to view shows from your favorite provider is to purchase a Fire Stick, Roku, or Chromecast wi-fi connector at the same time you purchase the projector and plug it into one of the two HDMI ports . I am using the Fire Stick 4k HDR and can stream from my Netflix account. The picture and audio is excellent. This information would have saved me many hours of research, trial, and error and should be included on the Artlii website, as well as other projectors in this price range.",

Yo lo estoy usando con un chromecast para reproducir mi contenido y todo excelente, he visto contenido en YouTube, Netflix, Prime, etc. Me sorprendi\u00f3 el sonido interno que tiene, no esperaba mucho en ese rubro, pero de verdad es muy bueno, hace que se te olvide el ruido del ventilador el cual calificar\u00eda como el ruido \"normal\" (con base en mi experiencia con otros proyectores). Definitivamente lo que m\u00e1s me gusta es el tema Bluetooth, pues si bien como dije, el sonido que tiene ya es bueno, al poder conectarlo por Bluetooth las opciones de audio incrementan pues lo puedes conectar a cualquier sistema de teatro en casa (por ejemplo) y la experiencia mejora a\u00fan m\u00e1s.
