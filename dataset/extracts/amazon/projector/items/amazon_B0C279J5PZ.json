                "reviewText": "I've been using this projector consistently for weeks now. I don't have enough space for a TV in my room and if I were to get a good one the cost would be an investment I'm not ready to take, so when I got this little projector I was not expecting much, but I was wrong! Let's start with the quality. This projector is sharp when used at the right distance.The colors are vibrant and bright enough. I use it to watch movies and anime. The quality is surprisingly good, the subtitles are sharp, my girlfriend does not have very good eyesight and she has no issues reading the subtitles. Now about the features. You get access to a simple and straightforward menu. Do you want to increase the intensity of the colors? Increase the color setting you want the image to be sharper or softer? You got the sharpness setting, you also get contrast and brightness. But in my tests, increasing the brightness only washes out the colors and it was bright enough already, so I left it in it's default setting. You also have other additional settings you can play with to customize your experience.Now about the product itself, it is lightweight and I don't think you would like to drop it, so treat it with care, it is not noisy! I ran it a whole night and you could barely hear the fans. My last point would be the sound quality, for what you get and everything else I've stated so far, this is the weakest point, but it does not mean that is bad. I think it will be fine. If you have a speaker system, then just have the audio come out of that and you are set!Overall, I'm very happy about what I got. I enjoy the quality and the size is more than enough to completely put aside the need for a TV. Keep in mind, this will do great for a basement or your room/living room. I'm very happy with it and it satisfies my current needs!",

                "reviewText": "Mini Video Projector with 7500 Brightness, 1080P Supported, Portable Outdoor MovieOur primary projector in our living room is a mini projector and I would consider this product to be a MICRO projector. I can't believe how small this product is. It is 30% smaller than my mini projector.The projector performs surprisingly well. It is lightweight and doesn't get hot. The fan is a little bit loud and can be heard even when playing a movie. It's not a big deal and you soon ignore it. This projector is so small, it can easily fit into a backpack and taken on a trip, camping, or where ever a projector could be used.One aspect I love about this product is the power supply is built inside the unit. This means you plug the cable from an AC outlet straight into the unit. No bulky AC-DC converter.The product listing claims this product is good up to 176\", but I am going to say you should keep it under 110\". At about 100\" you can start seeing the separation of individual pixels. This is a little distracting during the daytime, but I can't even notice it at night time. The product is plenty bright, and can be used in a mostly dark room. For this projector, the darker the better.The menus on this product are pretty basic looking. Kind of reminds me of the programming of a VCR. Inside the menu, you can turn on a sleep timer. This will help extend the life of the product. The product uses LEDs so it will last for a long time.The product doesn't come with a lot of extra items like a lens cap or carrying case. They do provide the cables you need to connect to your devices though.Overall, this is a really fun little projector. For the price, you are getting an awesome product. If you are looking for a big screen for the bedroom or garage, this little projector can get you set up with very little money. I highly recommend this projector.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Very nice Projector! It includes an av & hdmi cable and a remote control.The size is very handy and easy to move anywhere you want, but the power cord is not long enough so you might need an extension cord to put it somewhere you like. The projector is a friendly user easy to navigate as well. For connecting your phone or any devices you still need an adapter to connect to the hdmi cable. The picture quality is perfect, I tried it where there\u2019s a little daylight while making the screen bigger, still you can see how good the quality is.(As seen on my video). You can adjust the settings for pictures and volume by the way. For the speakers it\u2019s fine I guess and I think you can connect an external audio if you like but haven\u2019t tried. Wish they will upgrade and I can connect a bluetooth speakers. That would be fun! But overall I love it \u2026",

I don't expect it to last forever and yes, it isn't as sharp as the ones that cost 10 times more, but it's great for watching some kids shows/movies outside or even some powerpoint presentations.",
