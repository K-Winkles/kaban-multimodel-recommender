                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was about to purchase the kpop Astronord projector to watch my music videos from youtube. It was more than 130 with shipping and no free returns so I quickly came to amazon & decided to try this one instead based off of the amazing reviews. I can definitely say I am extremely happy with this purchase! Anybody who wants to get the Astronord projector should definitely go for this one instead! The pros: much cheaper, amazing quality, and free returns with amazon!The images above were taken in the day and the image is super clear! The picture quality is the best that I\u2019ve seen on a projector with this price! The brightness is also amazing and can go up a little more if you change the picture setting to vivid in the settings. The remote control is also a really nice touch for those lazy ones out there like myself.Overall I say do not think twice about this projector, just get it! It is everything I could\u2019ve wanted in the Astronord one for an amazing price! Amazing alternative for a television! I dont remember if the other comments mentioned but for the size I didn\u2019t expect the sound to be very good but the sound was absolutely amazing! It can get very loud and I could close my room and hear it from outside. Extremely loud, amazing picture quality, amazing overall. No need to get a super expensive projector when this one exists! Truly amazing buy from Amazon & I do not regret it one bit and neither will you! Do not think twice, just buy this if you\u2019re looking for a great projector! Worth every penny (: I am excited to try it tonight in the complete dark for optimal image quality but I really love that it works even in the daytime! So amazing I could continue recommend this product enough! I was not disappointed at all!",

You can sync your device via Bluetooth for audio only.Great if you wanna hook up your Nintendo switch and play Smash with the bois.Of course it does come with cons, I couldn\u2019t figure out how to reposition the image so you have to point the projector directly into the desired height, I highly recommend purchasing a tripod.Overall this is the best value projector I\u2019ve owned.Check it out!",

I love how I can play movies on it, or even do some gaming and project it on a wall. Perfect for those times when I want a larger area for some multi-player action.I wish I had ordered this sooner, as I would have had movie night with my family and their families, projecting a movie up on the back wall.I am certainly going to use this at Halloween, as it would be great to set up outside to watch some movies as we have people trick or treating.There are so many possibilities I am super excited about the prospects.The picture was clear, and it was very easy to set up and use. I did take some pictures of the projection as well, but they did not come out too well on my cell phone.I will be using this ALL year long!",

No way to contact seller. No way to figure out why this is happening. No instructions came with mine. This is absolute crap. The fire stick is the only way (that i have) to get around the copyright. I purchased a projector in 2020, with 4 fire sticks. I invested lots into these sticks to be able go use them around the house and in the backyard. Now I have to use my streaming box with this projector which doesnt get any signal outside... how am I supposed to watch a movie that doesn't have sound? If you say it works with a fire stick, you better make sure it actually works! I might have to return this. If I proves to be more than its worth to get the streaming box to work outside, then I don't want this garbage. Again, another projector that is useless to me.",
