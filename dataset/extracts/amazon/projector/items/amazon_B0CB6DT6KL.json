The video quality is great and the sound quality only depends on the Bluetooth speaker that you use. The internal speaker on the projector is ok but not great if you are watching a movie where sound quality is preferred. We used a firestick as a source for streaming. I have not tried to use my phone to connect to it. I\u2019m not sure how it is possible. Overall, this is a great affordable option if you have a nice dark room to watch movies. The same will go for outdoor use.",

I prop it up on a box and it gives me about 50 inch vision on my wall. The sound is surprisingly good for such a compact unit. Definitely gonna keep this for my years in school.",

This projector has transformed my backyard into a cinematic paradise, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The TMY projector boasts a stunning 1080P resolution that delivers crisp and vibrant images. Whether I'm watching my favorite films or streaming content from my devices, the clarity and detail are remarkable. The colors are rich and true to life, and the contrast is spot-on, making every movie night an immersive experience. Pairing my devices with the TMY projector is a breeze thanks to its Bluetooth capabilities. Whether it's my smartphone, tablet, or laptop, I can easily connect and stream content wirelessly. The Bluetooth speaker compatibility is a fantastic addition, delivering impressive audio quality without the need for external speakers. Setting up and using the TMY projector is straightforward, even for someone like me who isn't particularly tech-savvy. The remote control is intuitive, and the on-screen menu is user-friendly. I also appreciate the keystone correction feature, which allows me to adjust the image to fit perfectly on my outdoor screen.",
