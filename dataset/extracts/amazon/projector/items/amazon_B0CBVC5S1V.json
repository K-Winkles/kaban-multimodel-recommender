I connected a big speaker bar via bluetooth and my friend had a big projector screen we rigged to the side of the house. I was very surprised at how crisp the detail was. I'm thinking of setting this up to my PS4 and playing GTA on it LOL. Very good deal.",

Only thing I noticed is 2 black spots appearing on the bottom left screen. Looks like little bug or Like something is stuck between the lens. After cleaning the front lens and its still there I assume it's something stuck between the lens... was easy to setup and sync my surround sound system to. Going to ask for replacement",
