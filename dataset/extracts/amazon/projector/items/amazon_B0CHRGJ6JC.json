                "reviewText": "SPECTACULARWe loved it, it works very well.POSITIVE: The product comes in a cardboard box very appropriate and with good internal protectors that protect the product. At first glance it looks modern and nice. It works immediately. It has many options and the video quality is very good. The audio is acceptable, but if you want better volume, you can connect to external BOSE speakers. The build quality is very good, it has good weight and the base is stable. The rear controls are good and simple to use. The image size is adjustable with a zomm. The picture automatically adapts to the wall, which I find amazing. The remote control helps to navigate within the screen very easily. I have yet to use it and program it and navigate through its functions, I have only used it twice and both times were very enjoyable for our family.NEGATIVE: The included cable has a round or cylindrical plug, which does not work in the USA, you have to put an adapter, or if you prefer, change the plug.RECOMMENDATION: It would be very nice to include a cloth or velvet case for storage or transport.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical of this given the price point, but the visual quality was definitely better than I expected. It is, of course, not a true 4K projector, but appears to be a 720P projector (yes, it could presumably play a 4K video, but you wouldn't get 4K quality). I primarily got it in order to play media from flash drives, and overall the interface is pretty intuitive IMO. Audio codec support with the provided video player seems maybe a bit spotty, some files play fine, others don't. Using another app may solve this, I haven't tested extensively.The auto keystone correction didn't seem to work in all scenarios, but adjusting it yourself through projector settings is pretty easy. Better results in a dark room, of course.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great unit for the price point. If you are looking for a home theater experience in your living room or basement, look elsewhere. The volume is quite unimpressive, and you will need to hook up an external speaker to the auxiliary since the bluetooth is extremely basic in nature. I have used this outside on the garage and it works great for that, or maybe a bedroom. We have enjoyed it in the summer and we can watch sporting events outside pretty easily, so that's a plus. The mirror function works good, but not great. I have not connected a Roku or a Firestick yet, but will report back once I do!",

At close range the picture is quite good, when I turned it to a wall further away it definitely wasn't as good but, would still be good enough for watching a movie outdoors. The sound wasn't too bad either, considering that it's coming from such a little speaker inside the unit.",

                "reviewText": "This is a neat mini projector. Although it claims resolution in 4K, I would say it\u2019s similar in quality to a 1080 P television. Given the price, it\u2019s actually quite bright but in a very sunny room, you will have trouble seeing it. And a pitch black bedroom for example, it\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s how I recommend using this just in bedrooms or in hotel rooms where you know you\u2019ll have a dark space.",
