                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Projector and great sound",
                "reviewText": "The product's physical size is comparable to normal (much higher priced) projectors. The cloth finish on top and rugged plastic bottom make for a sleek and modern finish. Package comes with:Power Cord, Power Adapter, HDMI and a RCA Connector cable, and of course the projector itself (with protective lens cover).The video inputs are plentiful. USB, VGA (PC), HDMI (2 of these) and a memory stick card. I believe there is one more I'm forgetting but overall it is stacked with all sorts of modern inputs for any of your devices (we tried Apple TV, Roku stick and even a PC with HDMI and VGA connections). A couple of Audio outputs are also in the mix, to hook into a higher end stereo/surround sound system.The unit's image quality on the wall was surprisingly sharp (once the shape was modified and the focus was adjusted) and plenty of brightness. I can see us using this many times over the course of the warmer season (outside) and my kids already want to do movie nights inside (project it in a large screen in our garage).The best feature for the money spent is the Audio. This has what would sound like a relatively higher end wireless speaker (not perfect quality, but not had enough treble and base to produce higher quality sounds). I was skeptical about the audio unit being inside the projector at first, but once I listened to it, I was pleasantly surprised. There are always the Audio-Out ports to direct the sound into a surround sound system, but if you are using it at a campground or a small outdoor venue, the audio on this will fit the needs without sacrificing the ability to hear it clearly.Overall this projector is a wonderful sized unit, very inexpensive and produces great video and audio from an all in one unit. I recommend for anyone looking to get into the projector arena with their kids and who knows. You will likely find yourself watching movies with friends and family on a regular basis.This product does a great job and I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested and should provide you years of entertainment. Very inexpensive, impressive quality of video and wonderful entertainment for family on a nice summer evening.",

                "reviewText": "This is replacing an Epson DLP 1080P projector that we use about once a month for family movie night and camping. The Epson had no onboard speakers and a VGA input. The HDMI to VGA conversion cable was quirky and sometimes did not work. I also had to plug in external speakers which was a pain.This unit had HDMI input and built-in speakers which was what I needed. It's not much smaller than the Epson, but it's lighter.Pros- It's low cost- Decent video quality- Decent brightness- Light weight- Built in Speakers- Remote- Onboard controls- It can be hung from your ceiling- Can project up to 200 inch screenCons- Video image quality is a bit fuzzy (especially at edges)- Speaker sound quality is poor- Manual image adjustments (which does not bother me)- Needs to be mostly level with screen- No case- No internal internet apps (we have an Amazon Fire cube, so not an issue)- External Power Supply (seriously stupid)Overall, I am happy with my purchase for the cost. Not looking for a high-end unit, but more of something we can use camping and occasionally for movie night. For these needs, it's perfect. If you are looking for a light use, low resolution projector at a low cost, this will work fine for you.",

The price for this bundle is not bad compared to others and it works great in my opinion. It is also easy to operate and set up. We just hang ours as we go and at times we just shine the projector on the white siding of the house as well. If you are looking for something fun to do I recommend grabbing one of these!",

                "reviewText": "I have had this product for less than a year. I started using it regularly about a month ago and the sound randomly cuts out and will not work at all for hours at a time. I have tried to run the sound through a Bluetooth speaker, paired with an Alexa device and through the projector itself. It does this same thing with each choice. There is no option anywhere on my order or on the product page on Amazon to contact the seller. The help function for this product says to contact the manufacturer but the website it lists takes me to a patio furniture website that has no electronic products. The trouble shooting provided does not help. Amazon keeps telling me to contact the seller but there is no option to do that. Very disappointed.",

Though soon enough there was projecting errors in the both top corners (15 days), so I will be returning it. The picture is clear and the writting is clear, red is more red than cheaper version, so I found. You can choose the aspect ratio to just scan, so it works well when I am streaming, but I suppose, what do you really expect for a $240 projector, you may buy one and not get a fault, if you do \"Great\", it is worth the money, as the sound is not even really to bad. But if you do, remember to keep the Packaging incase you need to return it.EDIT: After contacting the seller in regards to the issue, I was very impressed with the customer service and all my issues were solved beyond my expectations with needing to contact Amazon directly.",
