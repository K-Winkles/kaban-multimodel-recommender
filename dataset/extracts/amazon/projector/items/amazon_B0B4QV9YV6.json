                "reviewText": "This is my third projector (over the past 20 years). My last projector was about ten years old and due for a bulb so, with all of the tech advancements, replacing it with a new unit made sense. I use a 108\" (9 ft.) diagonal screen.This BenQ is very inexpensive (about 1/2 the money of my old Optoma DLP), but is MUCH brighter and the colors are more vivid. I'm running on 'ECO' mode and still had to dial the colors/brightness back a bit. The difference between the two is stunning.It also has a slightly smaller footprint.My only niggle is the dreaded 'screen door effect'. To me, it is much more pronounced here than with the Optoma (my wife doesn't see it). It could be because the picture is so much brighter/clearer. I improved it somewhat by de-focusing the picture a bit, but on certain scenes (lighter colored backgrounds, mostly) it is still pretty noticeable. If you are one of the lucky ones who doesn't see it, then this thing has a GREAT picture.This would never be mistaken for a high-end unit, but - for the money - it is reeeeally good, and a pretty huge step up from the old machine. That's not a knock on Optoma. I loved the old one. But 10-year-newer tech is hard to beat.Long story short: STUPID good for the money, buy it.",

                "reviewText": "Before i purchase the 2020 Th585. I've tried those unbranded but high rating,low cost projectors(below $300) I was disappointed with the result.I returned all of them and decided to give BenQ a shot based on the review, spec and warranty. the video quality and brightness are much better and the warranty is better too. I didn't test the 10w speaker since i use a Bluetooth transmitter to connect to my Bose speaker. I would suggest the same to you. You get a projector for cinema experience why stay with the 10w speaker and what do you expect from a 10w speaker?Below are some more details about this projector,Pro:1. I Connect it to my 1080HD Apple TV to watch Youtube and Netflix both result are great.Image is crisp and bright. The contrast is 10000:12. Three year projector Warranty and 1 year for lamp. Optoma only provide 3 months warranty for the lamp which you can probably tell they are not confident with their own product.3. Fast Customer Service. Called them for some details. The rep didn't know the answer. Grab my info and manager replied in 2 hours.4. Fan noise is lower than those unbranded LCD projectors.Con:1. Not really a Con but the accessories are very basic. Just a VGA cable and Power Cable. Other brand come with HDMI cable.2. Key Stone is only Vertical i don't know why. Adding Horizontal shouldn't be difficult3. RS232 and D sub port is outdated. More USB and HDMI, optical port would be great.Overall, I would recommend this Model because 4K projectors are still above $1500 in now day and 4K media are still limited which means you would probably get a 4K projector but end up with watch 1080HD contents most of the time. Though this projector is using old technology DLP but it also means the technic is more mutual and cost is cheaper. Although the lamp life is shorter but it is not diffcult to change and it only cost you less than $60 for the bare bulb.",

                "reviewText": "We were deciding about a TV upgrade, but realized a projector would be better to hang from over our kitchen given the furniture placement.Didn\u2019t want to break the bank in case it didn\u2019t go well; we are super happy with the results! Picture quality is good, and with the gaming mode enabled, things are smooth enough for a great experience.Is it 4K OLED? No. But who cares? It looks awesome and is at a screen size I would not normally pay for. Plus it all rolls away!Only hitch was that there are only two HDMI inputs, and no optical out, so had to buy a separate box to facilitate all the devices. But that actually ended up being good since I didn\u2019t want to have to run a half dozen cables to the projector.",

                "reviewText": "I shopped around quite a bit for the right projector within my budget around $500 to $800 and this projector blows me away! Honestly it has better specs than some of the Epson projectors, is a better value and allows you to change the bulb when it goes out. That was a deal breaker for me as Epson their entry models become a paper weight if the bulb goes out as you cannot replace it! Makes no sense to me but would recommend this one. It is 1080p and very clear and bright, it shows up even in a lit room! It has manual focus and zoom, plus only has a vertical keystone no horizontal which is okay but not great. But for the price I can\u2019t complain, so will be mounting on ceiling soon!",

                "reviewText": "It was hard to find reviews on projectors being used specifically for golf simulators. This works very well, the speaker is exactly what you would expect out of something like this..enough to make noise...dont rely on it, add a speaker (easy enough) the zoom could be a little better as I cannot find the sweet spot in regards to distance from the screen when you might use an iPad or a PC. I compromised and maximized the distance for an iPad and when I use a PC change the PCs screen resolution.That being said, very bright, even with the lights on, very sharp, and when I use just a single light in the room to see my tee box, it really shines. I will be using this for some time. My son heard \u201cgaming\u201d and it's \u201cchallenge accepted\u201d as soon as I get feedback on it, I will update this review.Would I recommend for movies? AbsolutelyGolf simulator? You bet, I would highly recommend, just know what platform you will use and set it up for that..So far I like it a lot!",

The fan is quiet, which is a plus for me, because the projector stands just above our couch. Perhaps it's not the crispest image for a 1080p projector, but for the price, it really is worth it.",
