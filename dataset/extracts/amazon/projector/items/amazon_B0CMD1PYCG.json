After setting, the projector will be able to decode the audio from the stick. Why is my projector out of focus and blurry? Please adjust the focus ring and keystone ring to try to optimize image quality. And manually correct the image shape with four-point keystone correction if needed. (Optimal angle of projection: \u2264 20\u00b0) Why is there no response when I use the remote control? 1. The remote control does not come with batteries, so please prepare two AAA batteries on your own and install them into the remote. 2. Point the remote at the IR receiver at the back of the projector. Are external Bluetooth devices compatible with the projector?

                "reviewText": "The footprint is pretty small so it is easy to take with you or move around as you need. For presentations use it is simple to set up and take down when the venue doesn't have AV already set up for you. For movies/TV it is better to have an external audio system, either wired to a sound system or a bluetooth speaker system, the internal speakers are fine for presentation work, but are lacking any power or dynamic range for a movie.All of my use has been with wired connections so I don't speak to other connection methods. I have a Chromecast dongle that I can plug into this and it plays through without any difficulty in set up.Being a projector it works better in a darker environment so a daytime back yard barbecue is not the time for this, though an evening game would show up great on the large screen, otherwise known as the garage. It is nice for turning any larger room into a movie room for the night.I don't understand the statement of being a 4K supported projector when it is a 1080p. I have used it on 4K output and it looks fine, but it's 1080p not 4K. It does look good, I just don't understand what the statement is saying.Focusing is simple as is setting keystone for the screen or garage or wherever your screen is. Once set the focus and keystone stay put unless you go adjust them. This is nice as I've had a projector that drifted with the fan vibration. This one stays put.For it's price point this is a useful projector you can use in a variety of environments. It has clean picture and internal sound. I've never seen a projector that had good sound, not really the function. But this one has several methods of providing either line or wireless connection to your sound system to provide good sound.",

I would say it is great for indoor use, but outdoors would probably need to connect a Bluetooth speaker if you have a bigger group spread out watching. The picture quality and colors are good, can adjust the tilt and zoom for clarity. My only issue that I've been unable to figure out is that when I screen mirror from my phone, it won't play from my streaming services. It will play the audio and show subtitles, but won't show the actual movie for some reason?? I'm pretty sure that is a user error lol and not the device though.",

                "reviewText": "We already have a projector in our home that we use instead of having an actual tv and it has worked perfect for us for the last several years. I wanted to get a movie area setup outside so that we could all sit out there and watch a movie together. This projector has worked out really nice for us. Getting everything setup wasn't terribly difficult, but we did have some trouble at first. A lot of it is just figuring the ins and outs of the system, so once you get it, it's no longer an issue. The speakers on the setup are not that great, and if the projector isn't close enough to where your seating arrangement is, you'll definitely want to get a portable set to connect it to instead. I love that it came with its own screen but make note that you'll have to attach it to your setup yourself as it is literally just the screen. No poles or other ways to hang it are included. Overall, especially for the price, it's a great setup.",

                "reviewText": "This little projector is a great bargain and especially awesome for back yard viewings. It's easy to pair with devices and is a great value for the money.It doesn't seem as bright as it says it is. At 15000 lumens it should be bright enough to use indoors in a lit room with no problem. It is not that bright though. It compares to the other 6 or 7K lumen projectors we have in our office in terms of brightness. We dim the lights in our room to view.For indoor use, the fan inside the unit is too loud to be practical. If you're having a meeting it's not so bad, but I would not want to use it as a display projector indoors in my house. So I took it to the office for meetings. In that setting it works well.For the price, though, it works great! And I love the small size.If it had a quieter fan, which would of course make the unit larger, I would give it 5 stars instead of 3.",

                "reviewText": "This projector is pretty decent. It's not the most user friendly, as the menu options are not obviously clear and connecting to a device via bluetooth or screen mirroring can be a bit of a pain. I wish that the projector had the option to zoom in and out more than it does without moving the entire unit, but it doesn't. The pictures are a bit misleading as well. Your picture won't be as clear as a TV or a phone or tablet. It's a projector and a relatively inexpensive one at that, but it is not bad by any means! The speakers are lackluster, I would recommend just connecting your own. It is nice that it comes with a screen, but the screen came with no poles, so if you want to use this outside or hang it anywhere, prepare to jerry-rig it yourself.Overall, if you have a big white wall or a movie screen already, I think this is a great piece of equipment for the price point. But do I think it's the greatest thing in the world and everyone needs one? Maybe not.",
