Rotate the focusing ring to focus the image. C. Keep the projector at a proper distance from the wall/screen. (Effective distance: 3.5-13ft) 2. How to use a USB flash drive/hard drive After the projector recognizes the USB flash drive/hard drive, the USB icon on the homepage will turn blue. Then select one of the 4 file options (Movie, Music, Photo, or Text) to enter the corresponding file folder page. 3. Wired connection to phone/tablet It will fail if only a common USB charging cable is used to connect the projector and phone/tablet. It is necessary to use a Micro USB/Type-C/Lightning to HDMI adapter.(Note: the adapter not included ) Connect the adapter to the micro USB/Type-C/Lightning port of the phone/tablet, the HDMI port of the projector, and the USB port of the projector/power adapter.",

The clarity is great. I love how easy it is to hook up and get started. Plug it in, and you\u2019re ready. It\u2019s quiet. The box it comes in is a good sturdy box with a handle so transporting it to everyplace I\u2019m going to use it will be easy and I won\u2019t worry about damaging it. I\u2019m very happy with this projector.",

                "reviewText": "We use this for school time and for special dinner movies. The image is very high quality - we've used it mostly at a distance of 6-12 ft, and the image was great. The brightness is good for the size and sound (it's not a loud fan), but you may struggle to see the projection unless you're in a very dim or dark room. Our main school room is a little bright, so the projection wasn't the best, but it was usable. When we use it in darker rooms with less direct sunlight, it performs much better. But based on the price and the quieter fan (which we really appreciate), I felt like we were absolutely getting what we paid for. It's very portable, we plug in a roku stick and we're good to stream whatever we need/want. We love the built in speakers (though not great for movies, we use a speaker set for that, for a higher quality sound - which are easy to plug in and use - it takes me 1 minute to grab them and set it up); the built-in speakers work really well for school or if we're using the projector in a smaller room or space.All in all, this product performs really well for the price and size.A few cons: The projector can't angle the image to square the output when the projector is at a tilt. The speakers get tinny and weak especially in a bigger space. Hard to use in a medium level of light or brighter as the image is hard to see.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So I actually waited a while to see how the projector held up before doing a review. Let me just say that it far exceeded my expectations. The first picture was when I opened and turned it on for the first time right out of the box. I wanted to see how it worked and whether it was even going to be worth keeping. Like i mentioned before it exceeded my expectations Don't get me wrong the interface is extremely simple. it has one main screen that gives you connection options. You just have to plug in an HD cable which comes in the box and connect it to your computer or tablet and it projects to a screen or wall. It's bright and very clear to see. I purchased a movie screen from another seller which was bigger than I expected but with small adjustments, you can move the projector back to cover the whole thing. This was our first time using it and we still hadn't gotten the hang of it just yet. The projector is compact enough that you can take it with you traveling and set it up anywhere you like. The only con is that there is no speaker or if there is one its not loud enough. We had to connect a Bluetooth speaker to the tablet to hear, but its not a deal breaker.Overall great purchase and a great price for what I received. Summer nights have gotten a whole lot better",
