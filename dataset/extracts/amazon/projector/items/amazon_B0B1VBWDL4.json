We used a 120 out door blow up screen and the picture was awesome (can\u2019t see there). With the sound you would have thought you were at a drive up. In the house it worked on the wall great as you can see! Picture is great!Picture is bright reflects well with whatever device used. We used a firestick but it comes with a remote( you need batteries),USB port, hdmi cable, plug for projector, av cords. This device is not Bluetooth.It\u2019s TINY and fabulous we love this item!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a cheap projector to use for outdoor movie nights. It's blown me away. The projector has a really good picture quality. There's sound but I prefer to use a bluetooth speaker so I have more base and can make it louder. This is easy to connect to. My biggest issue is the bluetooth connecting to my computer. It works great with my phone so it might just be a computer connectivity issue. Other than that, I love this projector and will be using it more often.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting a ton from this projector, as the price was quite low. It's not a \"smart\" unit, so you'll need to provide your own Roku stick or Amazon fire stick or something similar if you want to use it to watch streaming media. The USB port doesn't provide enough power to power my amazon fire stick, which was frustrating - as now I have to run power from the projector AND from the fire stick into the wall. The picture quality is pretty good though, and it is plenty bright enough for me - however I only really use it in the evening. In a bright room, this wouldn't work very well.The fan is quite loud unfortunately, so you have to have the volume up a decent level to hear anything clearly. Also, it puts out quite a bit of heat.With all that said, I'm still happy with the value for the dollar. All of those items could be fixed simply by spending a little bit more, but for the super low price I paid for this, it works just fine.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. - the audio is pleasantly clear and loud- the fan is definitely among the quietest that I've heard, but not completely gone which is to be expected for a projector at this price point- definitely portable; the projector is still smaller than my small hands- no overheating as long as it is ventilated; I was able to connect the projector to a stand that I already had and the projector never gets any hotter than warm even after a few hours of use- the picture quality isn't as clear as I would typically want; there are less pixels per inch compared to another projector that I currently have, but honestly it's not that big of a deal since it isn't that obvious unless you're sitting super close to the screen, besides that though the screen is very bright (I also apologize for the video attached\u2014my phone was having trouble focusing resulting in some blurry moments)- I like the design of the remote and the program of the projector itself is easy to navigateSummary:This projector is ideal for use in smaller spaces and traveling. I would 10/10 recommend this projector to anyone that has a budget that can't be broken. Although not the best projector you can find, it is definitely one of the best that you can find at its price point.",

Very happy with this projector.Review:Shipping - It came in an Amazon box in less than 3 days. It was very well packaged with bubble plastic and very secure.\"So all in all very pleased with shipping 5/5.Build - Solid! There is a white hard plastic exterior with a slight Matt finish. With a nice slick top plastic piece by the knobs that adjust picture quality \"ref pic\". The Remote seems okay not the best but serviceable. If it ever broke there is a manual set of buttons on top. Glad to see an included HDMI and RCA cable.Overall 5/5Viewing - AMAZING! twist of the knob and it's in perfect focus. Easy as that. The sound in okay but won't blow anyone away. It was to be expected since the projector itself is small. Attach an external speaker and you will be good to go.Dont wait! Dont double guess! Get it!",
