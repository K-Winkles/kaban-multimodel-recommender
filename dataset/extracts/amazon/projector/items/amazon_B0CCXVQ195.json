                "reviewText": "I received this portable projector a couple of months ago but it wasn't until recently that I had the chance to put it through its paces. I have used it twice now, once to project video and photos on a screen at home and once for a presentation to a community group.The projector is fairly easy to set up. I would not call it compact, but it is portable enough to carry around. The user manual does a fair job of explaining the connections used, the way to operate the projector and how to care for it.I initially connected my iPhone to the projector using an HDMI cable. I was able to project some photos on a white screen I have, but the images did not seem to be in HD quality. I then used my laptop to project a video. The quality was adequate but not the equivalent of showing the video on a large screen HD television. The only advantage is the ability to show the video on a bigger screen than the TV I have. For the images to be as clear and sharp as possible it is essential for the room to be as dark as possible. This is hard to do in my living room and impossible during the day.The experience I had presenting to a group in a conference room was better. That room had a better and larger screen and I was able to set up the projector at a more appropriate distance than I could in the smaller space in my home. It was also easier to control the lighting, eliminating nearly all of the ambient light. As a result, the slide presentation using my laptop was of higher definition. That was important as I was displaying text as well as images. The text wasn't great but it was readable.Overall, this Agreago projector cannot compete with much more expensive, professional units. But while it is not ideal for showing high definition videos it can be a good choice for home use.",

                "reviewText": "The advertisement picture was very misleading to me. It shows all the popular streaming apps available and that gave me the idea that this projector is a \"smart projector. \"IT IS NOT\". You can load a ROKU stick into the USB port and get the availability that way but the projector itself provides none of it. That's what I bought it for. It will project to a 100 inch screen but you have to be no further than a 9 foot viewing distance! I already have an older Optima projector that supports 3D viewing and puts out twice as bright a picture for a 100 inch screen at about 12-13 feet viewing distance. Guess I'm keeping that one and will NOT be replacing it with this one. The Optima projector is old enough that WiFi or streaming technology is not built into it. I thought this one had it all. But sadly it doesn't. And I don't know what quality people want to enjoy when viewing movies and videos from a projector but this one only looks good in a very dark surrounding with no ambient light what so ever! My Optima can be viewed during mid day light with only a slightly darkened room. I chose this one because of the very cheap price. But you get what you pay for. I often wonder if any makers over in China ever try out these products to their satisfaction before they make up the ads and their companies set out to sell them. I can't use this projector in my living room unless I am able to bring it closer to the screen on a tripod and set up the room for later at night viewing. It's more for using outside on a wall in the dark rather than full theater effect inside. I'm feeling like I'll need to stay with the $800-$1000 projectors to truly get what I want.",
