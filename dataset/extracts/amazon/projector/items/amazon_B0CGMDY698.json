I use a receiver with speakers so can't speak to it's sound but Arc works well. The color is also great out of the box, but I'm sure calibration would improve it further. There are jaw dropping moments with this projector when the visuals are exceedingly great. Highly recommend getting the Formovie if you are looking for a UST.",

Generally we see projectors from other reputed brands like epson, LG, samsung etc. sold in electronic stores. You see this projector being sold there. But if you do some research, you will get to know about this projector being talked about mostly on reddit and other forums and on YouTube.ProsThe quality of picture is amazing(especially when you watch 4k and 8k content). I was initially looking for an oled tv, but since my room bigger decided to go with the projector and picture quality wise it came very close to meeting my expectations.The sounds of this projector is crisp. For this price range the projector is worth the money.ConsThe app is bit slow and sluggish. The remote could have been better. The remote doesn't come with batteries, so make sure you have couple of AAA batteries. If your room has ambient light, you may need to spend some money buying ALR screen.",

Sadly, there was a technical issue but that only enhanced my experience (if that\u2019s possible), the entire return process was smooth, i had a replacement unit 2 days later AND it was personally tested by their team. Money has been refunded, and i got EXACTLY what i wanted from the product, and the company. HIGHLY recommended and you can trust the reviews on the quality of the projector and the team. 5 star",

                "reviewText": "Coming from a 75\" tv that was loaded with Dolby Vision, 120hz, VRR, and ALLM, this projector really surprised me. I did my due diligence before I made my purchase and did what I think was too much research. For the cost out of the box, thing is pretty impressive. And then you start to tweak the settings and it really comes alive! I paired it with an ALR/CLR screen that's 103\" from Elite Screens, and wow did my movies and gaming come to life in a big way. I haven't had any problems with the setup or use, so I cannot comment on the customer service of Formovie, but from other reviews I've read, it's pretty top notch. My only complaint is that the remote isn't backlit, but once it's setup if you are using any kind of programmable universal remote, you shouldn't need it. If you're on the fence about going to a UST over a tv, for the cost you're never going to find a tv that does what this UST does up to 150\". I'm glad I went with this one for my home theater setup.",

The Out of box colour settings are off and is very blue-biased but with proper calibration settings, you can get it to work like a charm.The only thing which really gets on my nerves is false advertising and claims. It says on the box that it supports HDR10 +, but that is not the case as I tried everything, and HDR 10 + does not work. What it does it decodes it to HDR 10. This does not work well with me in terms of false advertising and claims.How is Formovie taking proper action against this fiasco of a problem is my main question.",
