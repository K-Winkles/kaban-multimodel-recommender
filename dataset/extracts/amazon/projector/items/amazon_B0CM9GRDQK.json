Only problem I have is it only reads usb sticks not greater than 64gb. Other than that, this is an amazing buy. I can't wait to watch it at 100+ zoom on a bigger screen.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this projector for my loft to screen movies from netflix and hulu this holiday season, i have been using since 2 weeks now and it works really great. it is a very light weighted and a beautiful set for home entertainment came with a bunch of accessories for setting up your home entertainment. It took me 15 mins to read and set up the equipment without any difficulty as the instruction manual was very helpful and has complete step by step steps. You can connect your pc/tablet via bluetooth and play videos or cast your screen to this projector device. Which is infact a great addition with an ease of using this device without any effort. We can adjust the screen lenght as we want and the remote response is pretty great. My family came over for the Christmas and we played a lot of movies using this projector as it was a full time fun and entertainment. I have included a unboxing video for your reference but this is amazing as can be used anywhere if you have a power supply. Good to have a screen but wall projector is great with the video quality and the sound is pretty great. Great purchase for the holiday season. Thanks amazon.",
