                "reviewText": "I recently decided to upgrade my entire outdoor movie setup. New projector, new screen, new sound system. In the past I have used an old Black & Decker Workmate to put the projector on along with the amplifier. It works but, it's a pain to get out because of where it's stored. I saw this stand and decided to try it out. It works perfectly and required minimal assembly (literally just attaching the top tray). Much easier that what I was using. The height and viewing angle are adjustable as well and the tray is wide enough that it holds the projector and the remotes. I deducted one star because it's not the sturdiest tray. If you bump it the tray will jiggle. Overall I'm very happy with the stand and, short of someone falling on it and breaking it, I see no reason why it won't serve my needs for quite some time.",

                "reviewText": "Okay. So if you are reading this needing to know if it is good/bad for what it was intended for - then skip this review. My review is based on the need to have something to place my laptop on while I sit on my LoveSac to watch my streaming shows without having to hold the laptop on my lap or place it precariously on the beanbag chair - all the while worrying I am getting something not-so-good-for-me radiating into my legs/abdomen or an other part of my body (with my device so close to me). This enables me to watch my shows from a distance, as if my laptop were mounted on the wall like a real flat screen. I can move it with ease wherever and whenever I need to move my body to change position without having to change anything on the stand - which by the way, there are so many variances with height adjustment, angle, etc. The actual part that the laptop sits on can rotate 360 degrees with ease without compromising stability. All I can say is this: I have not been so stoked with a product since I came across this item in a very long time. Super easy to assemble (part of the tripod stick portion nestles into the main rod, so remember to pull it out to access it, don't call the company like I did stating a missing part) and worth every penny. To the company who makes this - KUDOS. And to all you people out there who use your laptop to stream your shows with - who lounge on a bed or a couch or anywhere else... this is a MUST.",
