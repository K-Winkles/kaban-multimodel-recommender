HDMI cord is included, so I tested it out with my laptop right away - turned on without any problems, no additional set up was needed.4. After connecting laptop or phone, you set up the projector where you want it and adjust the focus with an adjuster handle5. To make sure the projection is straight and not crooked, the projector must be completely parallel to the wall and preferably at a straight angle - not tiled. It will still show a decent image if tilted, but you will get the best picture if it is set up straight6. The sound will play directly from the projector as a default - but you can change that in your laptop settings to use your laptop speakers if you want.It does not run on battery - you must use the supply cord, which is not too long, so you will need to be close to an outlet. It does make noise when on, but if you turn on video you will not be able to hear it anymore.",

You can project onto a blank white wall or white sheet and even onto the ceiling.I like bright colorful compact design. It stows away easily after use. You can use the HDMI to connect your laptop, phone, Amazon Fire stick, Apple TV and much more.The picture quality is clear and crisp and remains clear even when increasing the display size.The sound quality is good, loud and clear. I did not even need to use a Bluetooth Speaker for better sound. I enjoyed the Surround Stereo Sound option that makes you feel like you are in a movie theater.There is a low fan sound from the projector running, however it is not a nuisance.The projector has quick response time, warm, cool and cinema movie picture quality options. You can also share images and audio from another device.All in good, it is a good solid product at a budget friendly price!",

In short, it is a good purchase for its price, I think I achieved a screen of approximately 55\u201d I leave you photos. The remote controller is a really good thing, the picture quality are nice, remember is 1080P max, but is a portable proyector",

                "reviewText": "This little projector will be great for anyone wanting to show movies or presentation slides through an HDMI connection to a computer. It connected perfectly with my Windows laptop and performed just as I hoped.When I tried the projector with various video files on a USB stick, it recognized both MP4 and MKV files, but it would only play the MP4 files; it threw an error with the MKV file playback. The MKV files worked fine on my computer and on another computer I transferred them to for testing. (That knocked it down from five stars to four.)The projector works as expected with its included power adapter. It can also accept power through a micro USB port (the kind used on older cell phones and bluetooth speakers). I successfully powered it that way using a portable power bank.The brightness and contrast are good if you use it in a very dark room. If the projector has to overcome even low levels of ambient light, you notice the drop in picture quality right away. Given its very inexpensive price point, I can't expect anything more from it.The box includes the projector, plug-in power supply, HDMI cable, remote (uses 2 AAA batteries, not included), and a an instruction guide that is most useful for telling you which button does what on the projector.Recommended for outdoor nighttime or indoor basement movies. Still a good value if that's what you need.",
