Love the fact that it does the same job as a 70\"+ tv for a fraction of the cost, especially with the fact it is a renewed/refurb product. It saves space from needing the actual tv and a stand, where instead it can sit easily sit on top of a bookshelf.However, it does have its caveats. The quality isn't going to be HD/4K res, as shown in my photos. So if you are an intense gamer or one of the sports fanatics who needs res to the extent of seeing every wrinkle on the player, this might not be for you.Additionally, sound quality directly from projector is reasonable for most scenarios. The one problem would be it can't handle having the audio is ALL the way up especially during a bass-heavy moment. You can probably get an HDMI audio extractor to hook it up to proper speakers, but I haven't found the need to yet.All in all, worth the purchase for my needs, would recommend",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after trying a smaller, less expensive projector. The church is well lit on Sunday morning, so I needed a bright picture, and this projector delivers in spades. I was even able to adjust the picture so that those on the far side of the building can see it more straight on. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for quality without a huge price tag. The only thing I wish it had that the smaller projector had is a thumb drive port and blue tooth capability. Otherwise, great product at a great price.",
