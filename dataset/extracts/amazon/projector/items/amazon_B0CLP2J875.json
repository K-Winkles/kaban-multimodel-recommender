                "reviewText": "No joke, this thing is awesome! It really is. I've loved projectors for as long as I could remember and have used them for travel, ranging from a portable 480p projector that could fit in your hand, to one used for a small business on stage, to outdoor, and as primary in my bedroom. There's always been one issue.. compact and/or budget friendly projectors are usually limited to 720p native resolution. Many products will say 1080p ready or something, but make sure to look at their native resolution in the product details because it will be lower. What I like about compact projectors is they don't take up much space are easy to mount (light weight). What I mean by this is they are easy to mount to the ceiling without a crazy or expensive mount, are easy to setup, and look nice.This thing goes beyond that. It's the most elegant projector I have ever used (and have seen at this price point). The thing is beautiful, supports NATIVE 1080p, compact, easy to setup, has great native sound (but you can add additional audio device, through hardwire or blutooth, etc). I can't say enough about it, this is my favorite projector to date. I highly recommend it.Again, honestly, I can't express how impressed I am with the Native 1080P Mini Bluetooth Projector. As a long-time projector enthusiast, I've experienced various models, but this one is a game-changer. The elegance, functionality, and outstanding features make it my favorite projector to date.Recommendation:The Native 1080P Mini Bluetooth Projector is a must-have for anyone seeking an unbeatable combination of elegance, functionality, and advanced features. Whether you're setting up a home theater or a business presentation, this projector delivers an exceptional viewing experience. Highly recommended!Details:I've used various projectors over the years, but the Native 1080P Mini Bluetooth Projector truly stands out. Its native 1080p resolution brings a level of clarity and detail that sets it apart from others in its class. The compact design, coupled with the elegant aesthetics, makes it not just a functional device but also a piece of technology that enhances any space.Setting up the projector is a breeze (which is not always the case), thanks to its focus, keystoning, options, connectivity, and intuitive software. The inclusion of WiFi connectivity, especially 5G, ensures quick and stable wireless projection without the hassle of cables. The HiFi speakers provide great audio, eliminating the need for external speakers.Whether you're watching movies, playing games, or giving presentations, this projector caters to all your needs. The wide compatibility with various devices and input ports adds to its versatility and ease of useIn conclusion, the Native 1080P Mini Bluetooth Projector is a standout product in its category. Its unbeatable combination of features, true native resolution, and elegant design make it a top choice for anyone in need of a high-quality, compact projector. I highly recommend it to fellow projector enthusiasts and anyone looking to elevate their viewing experience.TL;DR:I would recommend this projector!Pros:\u2022 True Native 1080P Resolution: Unlike many compact projectors claiming 1080p readiness, this one stands out with its native 1080p resolution, providing unparalleled clarity and detail.\u2022 Super Compact Design: The projector is not only compact but also beautifully designed. Its lightweight construction makes it easy to mount on the ceiling without the need for a complicated or expensive mount.\u2022 Impressive Brightness and Color Boost: Boasting 18K brightness and a 2x color boost, the visuals are vibrant and stunning. The 80% increased brightness translates into a 2.5x pixel count, ensuring a visually immersive experience.\u2022 High-Speed Connectivity: The industry's first WiFi-enabled native 1080p mini projector, the X7, offers high-speed 5G and 2.4G WiFi connectivity.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve never owned a projector before so I didn\u2019t want to buy one with a lot of options that I would never use. I liked that this has the bare minimum for my planned use. It started off badly. The first one I got was dead on arrival. I popped open the filter and it was dirty so it must have been a return. Amazon shipped me another a day later but I was already shopping for a replacement brand. It annoyed me that I had to go return the first one. The second one seems to be fine. If this one fails soon I\u2019m not going to be out too much money if they won\u2019t exchange it again. I\u2019m projecting onto the ceiling and it seems to be pretty clear using a 4K streaming stick. I just have to have it low to the ground if I want a giant projection because I don\u2019t have very high ceilings. I also had to buy a stand because it can\u2019t rest on its back according to manual and because of the streaming stick. I\u2019ve connected to the unit using Bluetooth but I\u2019ve been mostly using the aux cable with earbuds.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m a fan of using projectors instead of LCD screens (why not have a humungous screen for cheap, and no bulk), so I have owned my fair share of other projectors to compare this to.Pros:First off, this thing is stylish \u2014 almost an Apple product kind of look and feel. Compared to other projectors I\u2019ve had, this is FAR superior in the aesthetics category.The image quality is more crisp than my previous one of around the same price, and a tad brighter. The difference is noticeable.I mostly just use HDMI, but the wifi / smart capabilities are nice to have. Remote focus is very convenient.Big win: it\u2019s SO QUIET compared to any other projector I\u2019ve used. That\u2019s huge, especially if you plan on using this for home cinema.Cons: no adjustable feet \u2014 you\u2019ll have to put this on a tripod or prop it up with books to get the screen in the exact right place.So far that\u2019s it for cons, though. Very happy with this.",
