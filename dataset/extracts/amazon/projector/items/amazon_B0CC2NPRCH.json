                "reviewText": "We gifted this to our son for Christmas. I was pleased to get a really good Black Friday Deal. I haven't used projectors a lot before so I can't compare this with others but I did read the reviews for this so I can address some things. First, it was a bit of a pain to setup. The instructions that come with it are not very helpful. As far as I was able to tell in our trial and error setup, you WILL need something to assist with casting from your phone. We pulled a basic Google Chromecast off one of our TVs and all of a sudden it was working great. I think these are under $30 so it's worth the investment. I'm not familiar with Apple so sorry I can't address that. We just plugged in the HDMI cable to the projector and also the USB cable (both came with the Chromecast) into the projector to power the Chromecast. Fantastic. Then, for the audio. As far as I could tell you CANNOT do Bluetooth audio with this. You have to have an aux to aux cable (old school headphone jack on both ends), plug into your projector and into your speaker (make sure if you buy a speaker to go with this that it does have a plugin for an aux cord not just bluetooth capability--I ordered a basic bluetooth speaker for him and I was lucky, it did have a plugin). Once we got that figured out it was working great. Only concern now--the tripod that comes with this is not great. It's not very secure, doesn't hold the projector securely in all positions. My son wanted to cast onto the ceiling and he had to just cobble together a setup because the tripod wouldn't work for that without the picture being crooked. Even casting onto a wall it took a lot of fiddling with the tripod for it to even maintain a basic stability and then just don't bump it whatever you do!! All in all, we're happy with this now that we have it setup. The picture and sound (even the sound of the projector without the speaker is pretty good for its size!) are good, and we wanted a small projector so it would be portable, so we definitely got that. Pretty happy with it, just save yourself grief and have the Chromecast or whatever casting device and the aux cord ready to go!!",

My granddaughter loved this as a present for Christmas and she used it all day and it didn\u2019t heat up very much at all so that\u2019s good. 10 out of 10 recommend\ud83d\udc4d ( The photo is a little blurry but my hand was just shaking )",

                "reviewText": "At work I have had an Epson Powerlite 5 for about 10 years that I use for training at mobile sites that has a great picture. The Elephas I just purchased has a great picture as well but smaller, lighter, speaker built in and more connectivity options. This one I purchased for home use and have only had it for a few days but love the picture and versatility as well as price. The speaker has really good volume but does sound a little boxy in certain settings. It will do the job being so mobile and eliminating having to pack an external speaker. If this projector lasts as long as the Epson, its definitely worth the price. I plan on using this for family outdoor movies possibly with a sound bar.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this for my daughter's room so that she can watch a show or movie from her phone, and she doesn't have room for a tv. It would screen mirror from her iPhone, but it wouldn't screen mirror any kind of streaming device unfortunately. But, once I added an amazon fire stick it worked great.I love the size, and the tripod that comes with it to help angle the screen. It focuses easily and was easy to set up.Overall I recommend, I just wouldn't expect it to screen mirror streaming from your phone.",
