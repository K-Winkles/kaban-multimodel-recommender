                "reviewText": "Don't normally write reviews but I feel this projector deserves to be bragged about. I just got this Vivitek D862 projector and I am so impressed. My screen hasn't got here yet so I am only using a cream colored piece of fabric. I am impressed with the color accuracy and clarity especially since it's not on a proper screen. The settings have a menu that lets you choose the color of the surface you are projecting the image onto and automatically adjusts the color and brightness to give you the best picture possible. I have used it in a partially lit room and a dark room. The 3000 lumins of light is very good for giving a great picture in both lighting conditions. I run the projection bulb in standard mode instead of boost mode to extend bulb life and lower energy usage. Lower light output is still awesome! Has a lot of adjustments in the menu. I have only had this for a day so I don't have an idea of the longevity of it yet. Hopefully we'll give me years of great TV and movie watching. I would highly recommend this unit.",
