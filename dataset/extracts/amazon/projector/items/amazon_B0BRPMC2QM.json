Some things I love about it;\u2022the brightness of the display (hard to see in the picture but it\u2019s bright)! **Pictured is with lights on/off\u20221080p means there is a clear picture! It\u2019s better than my (older style) tv. Not sure why other comments say it\u2019s not clear? ***Pictured my projector is paired with a 100\u201d screen and is about 11ft away from the screen. It can go up to 150\u201d screen size!\u2022SUPER easy setup with clear instructions. You\u2019ll need batteries for the remote to get started. Took me all but 5 minutes to set up my screen and place my projector on the tripod (which it comes with).\u2022 Easily adjustable.\u2022 FUN for my whole family! We plan on watching many movies and tv shows out here this summer!10/10 I would say for the price and quality.\u2022This would make an excellent gift for a movie lover. The packaging was beautiful too!!",

Not only is it user friendly, the performance is also undoubtedly superior to other projectors. There is also an amazing speaker within it and the mirroring functionality is awesome to be quickly able to show anything on the projector from your phone. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a small projector for their room or even to use it on camping or anything else you'd like. The audio in itself is loud enough too, and the cooling fan is super quiet. With its 4k resolution capabilities, there's no need to buy an expensive tv that is fraction of the screen size for many times the price as this. This projector has it all!",

When projecting, the menu has a very simple layout for video, sound, picture settings, and it's easy to navigate the menu and set it up. The video sound can be played too as there is an internal speaker in the device. The sound quality is decent but I can also connect to a bluetooth speaker very easily for better sounds. The picture and video quality is satisfying given the price for this projector; I mainly use it to project movies or Netflix from the bed with no tv. I like the fact we can zoom smaller or larger for the projection. Lastly, it can play more than 4 hours continuously for me. I highly recommend the product to anyone who prefers projecting on a wall than getting a big tv.",

For a 720p projector the image is bright, good contrast and clear, even in the broad daylight!Wireless Bluetooth speaker was easy to connect, but there is a tiny delay in audio. When you have it wired with the provided AUX cable, there is no delay, it's perfect. The 3D lens adjustment is neat but it makes the corners of the image fringe/blur, so you want to keep the projector flat/parallel with the screen. It doesn't have digital keystone, so you cannot put the projector off axis. But overall it is great for the price, especially for travel since it's so compact!",

The integrated speakers sounds pretty good but you can also link your own sound system! The best thing about it is that it comes with a pouch to carry it in with all the things you need! Lens cleaning supplies, controller, tripod and cables! All that for a quarter of the price of a good television! Truly impressed.",
