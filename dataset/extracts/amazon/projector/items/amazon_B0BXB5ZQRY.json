                "reviewText": "This projector, while small and easily portable, does not put out a lot of lumens. It is best used in a very dark room and relatively close to the screen. It was easy to set up and runs well on its battery as well as when plugged in. I cannot comment on the sound quality as I HDMI'd it to my soundbar. I have also not yet used any of the built-in apps. Picture quality is just OK; it's better with animation than actual video, likely because of the clearer delineation present in animation as opposed to \"real life\" recordings. This is the first projector I've owned so I don't have a lot of ability to compare, but I suspect I might have been better off going for a higher-quality/less cheap model.",

                "reviewText": "this little projector is really cute and it works great. it is battery powered, rechargeable. You can take it anywhere and it can connect to phone, pc, video game systems, all kinds of different ways to play whatever you want to watch on the projector. The picture is very clear, much better than i would have expected for the little machine. I would say it competes well with the larger projectors. I have used it on a white wall, on a brick wall, and even on the ceiling and had a great viewing experience every time. The speakers work really well, plenty loud for everyone in the room to hear. Battery lasts quite a while. You can watch a few movies or several episodes of a show on one charge. It recharges pretty fast also. The price is reasonable and the quality is good. I would recommend to others",
