My kids enjoy watching their favorite movie on the big screen, like if they\u2019re at the theater..I did have an issue with adding my Wifi password, but their staff was quick & helped me with a simple device update. He also gave me step by step instructions on how to apply the update. Everything works great, my Xbox X looks great on it, streaming movies, mirroring my phone to show off photos.. It\u2019s definitely worth the money. Highly recommend, & if you travel, it\u2019s very compact easy to transport with you on trips. You can also connect your laptop like I did & use it for a presentation at work, or just to extend your screen to watch movies. Haha They did a great job with this one, the staff is very friendly & helpful.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good projector for the price ... obviously, it's hard not to expect cinema quality out of a projector, but you do have to realize that if you want true movie theater-like performance, $500 is about the entry-level for that. This really needs to be in a totally blacked out room in order to be enjoyable, or else you'd be better off buying a large screen television. Most will be projecting this onto a 100 foot 16:9 ratio screen, which is not 100 inches, but that's the diagonal measurement, so you'll have about 70-ish inches across. Still pretty big.My biggest knock on this projector is that it is VERY hard to find a suitable distance in order to fit it on a 100 foot screen. It seems that the picture has black bars on the top or bottom ... or bleeds over onto the walls on the side. I find that the sweet spot is about 7 feet in front of the screen for a perfect size on a 100 foot screen, which brings a big problem ... this means the projector will have to be set on a table (or a box in my case) which looks very unsightly. In addition, it will likely be in front of the viewer's sitting position, so you'll have a big projector and box setup in front of you. See my photo of the setup and you'll see what I mean. You are starting at the back of the projector and wires and there will be an obstruction in front of you.If you put it low on the table, such as a coffee table, etc. it will distort the picture so the top is wide and the bottom is more narrow and facial features, etc. look a bit distorted and stretched like a fun house mirror. Move the projector behind you and you get a giant image which will be too big for an even 100 inch screen. Move it further in front and you'll get a picture which is smaller and distorted when pointing up.Another knock on this is what it doesn't come with. The little screw in 'leg' which allows you to adjust this up and down is not included. I couldn't believe this ... to not include a part which is such a necessity (and hard to find on its own) is almost worth knocking it down another star. You will NEED to raise this a bit in order to project onto a screen, unless its somehow mounted behind you. I had to use a dustpan, which adds to the unsightliness of my stack of objects making up a projector tower so it can project correctly.Bottom line ... this will be fine for kids but don't think this is going to replace your tv in your living room flawlessly. Batteries for the remote also weren't included, which is fairly standard for projectors even in this price range. The speaker on this is almost useless ... in a quiet room, you might be able to sort of hear the dialog if you concentrate, however, it's barely audible. You will need a speaker to connect, which is hard to find because your option is RCA audio plugs and no speakers on the market work with those. There is no Auxiliary port, so your choices are llimited to RCA jacks and good luck finding those. Even most soundbars use USB or Bluetooth. I tried connecting a speaker via USB which didn't work and the projector has no bluetooth speaker ability. So that could be a big factor.The picture is actually pretty good when you are using a DVD. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming services are blocked on here. You cannot use this with those streaming services because they are not licensed to be projected. I was able to get it to mirror my screen using wifi and there was no screen lag, which is nice! My other projector in this pricerange has horrible screen lag, whereas this one is smooth. The colors when you are using wifi screen mirroring are off ... darker, the reds are distorted and look almost more orange, etc. It's good enough to watch a clip or movie but not as clear as a DVD would be. Again, if you use a DVD that is more wires and unsightly clutter in front of you.The lense had a little smudge on it right out of the package ... and actually, the first projector I was sent did not power on right out of the box. The power button would just blink. I was shipped out another one in a matter of days and that one worked fine, aside from the smudge on the lense. This is very lightweight and it feels cheap, so honestly, between the failure of my first attempted shipment, I am not banking on this lasting a long time.There are a lot of issues with this so my recommendation would be to use this for kids' movie nights or gaming for a treat ... but this will not be an average, everyday use projector unless your setup works perfectly distancewise or you are very handy to build some sort of mounting contraption and add on a speaker, DVD player, etc. in order to make it a set. On it's own this is more of a novelty thing ... however, I will say that both the picture quality and the brightness of this were fairly surprising to me ... much higher quality than I expected it to be. I was also surprised how easy the screen mirroring was to set up with my Android phone. Trying to do the same with my IPad was not as easy and I was unable to do this with a hard wired ipad or my ipad's screen mirror.For the price, this isn't bad. It would be a lot nicer if it was easier to project and have it fit the screen without stacking boxes up for it to sit on. If I had it to do over, I might have splurged on a higher-end projector that wasn't as finicky ... or at least came with a little screw in adjustable leg for the bottom.",

I used to own a palm-size projector, very easy for home or travel use, but not as bright as this lovely development.It supports Dual-Band WiFi, which also an improvement compared with my old belonging. I know 2.4G chips are cheaper but sometimes it's really annoying as not every router supports 2.4G Hz.The image quality is great and I've uploaded picture& video for your reference.Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Ho recentemente acquistato questo mini proiettore e sono rimasto soddisfatto delle sue prestazioni. Innanzitutto, il prezzo \u00e8 giusto per quello che offre. Il design \u00e8 estremamente portatile, il che lo rende facile da trasportare ovunque. Posso portarlo in viaggio o utilizzarlo all'aperto senza alcun problema.La qualit\u00e0 dell'immagine \u00e8 ottima considerando le dimensioni ridotte del proiettore. L'ho proiettato su uno schermo di 100 pollici e sia i film che i giochi sono risultati buoni. Qualsiasi dubbio sulla risoluzione si dissolve immediatamente dopo aver iniziato a guardare i video. Sono rimasto impressionato dalla nitidezza e dalla chiarezza dell'immagine.L'unica volta in cui ho notato qualche problema \u00e8 stato durante la visualizzazione di scene molto luminose, dove ho notato un po' di washout. Tuttavia, ritengo che sia solo una questione di pignoleria, perch\u00e9 nella maggior parte dei casi l'immagine \u00e8 adeguata. Inoltre, ho collegato l'USB con video MP4 e la navigazione e il funzionamento sono stati ottimi.Mi aspetto che questo dispositivo duri almeno due anni, ma se dovessi sostituirlo in futuro, lo farei volentieri con lo stesso modello. Il mini proiettore che ho acquistato ha molte funzionalit\u00e0 interessanti, come il supporto WiFi e Bluetooth, che permettono di connettere facilmente altri dispositivi. Inoltre, la compatibilit\u00e0 con sorgenti video 1080P massimizza la qualit\u00e0 dell'immagine e la chiarezza.In conclusione, questo mini proiettore \u00e8 un ottimo acquisto. Il prezzo \u00e8 ragionevole, il design \u00e8 portatile e l'immagine \u00e8 di alta qualit\u00e0.",
