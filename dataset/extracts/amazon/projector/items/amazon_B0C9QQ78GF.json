We did use USB powered speakers to help \"project\" the sound a bit more but the onboard sound is great in enclosed spaces. We like this little projector so much that we'll start taking it on camping trips in place of our much larger and significantly more expensive DVD Epson. We also used it on our back patio after Halloween and it compares nicely with our old DVD beast. This little projector exceeded our expectations, especially for Halloween.",
