Found remotes on AliExpress by searching for 'HK300 remote'.Picture is fantastic in a dark room but washed out when lights are on, see photos.Auto Keystone Correction is good but not perfect. I use a SAMHOUSING Ipad Tripod Stand, with 65 inch Height Adjustable iPad Stand Holder to place the projector on. It give me precise control for keystone correction and placement. See photos. It also holds my Amazon Fire 11\" tablet for viewing videos on the patio.Sound is OK but not great . I added a EWA Travel Case Packed, A106 Pro Portable Bluetooth Speaker which gives very good sound. It and the projector fit on the stand. See photos.Android 11 has some quirks, the new Amazon Prime video app does not work but it has an older version pre installed. The older pre installed Amazon Video app is hard to control with the remote unless you switch between the direction keys and remote mouse functions. But it does work. I could not get Hulu or Disney+ to work, so I plugged in my Roku stick and it worked great. The pre installed Netflix app works well.The picture is great in a darkened room and it is very quiet. Paired with a Roku stick and Bluetooth speaker it is a great little projector for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to be used in my bedroom since I don't have or want a television. I've had it for about 2 days. The only problem I am having is thatthe projector goes black ever 15 to 20 min it seems. This is not specific to an app as it will do it even if I am on the home screen, only the picture will stop but the sound will remain. This is not my first time using this projector brand (the other is iPhone compatible). I really hope this is a fluke and will try a replacement. The other projector did not have this issue.Viewing and set up experience:Keep in mind this is being used in a bedroom. For my needs it really checks all the boxes especially with the built in apps (unlike the iPhone one) , if it will just stay on. The picture is crisp and easy to adjust, sound is good, and the size is perfect on a nightstand. It is about the size of a large microphone and easy to move up and down. The included cord is short which can be limiting. The set up is literally attaching power cord and go, USB cord is included if you want to attach in other ways as well. Apps pre installed are Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime , and a few more.",
