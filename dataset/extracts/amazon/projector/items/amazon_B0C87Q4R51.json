                "reviewText": "Relatively simple setup. It auto-adjusts seamlessly. When we first turned it one we just pointed it straight up at the ceiling. Our textured walls and ceiling are white but smooth enough that any blank space becomes a backdrop for it. We bought a screen, but the walls actually seem to work better. Super portable. We move it around constantly and it quickly recalibrates for color, angle, etc.Once it's on your wifi you've got instant access to tons of tv- it's like having an old school cable box built in. Bright enough that you probably should not use 100% brightness level at night for eye health, but like all projectors, it doesn't work well if there's much ambient light. It won't work outdoors while the sun is up.The audio is even pretty great- good enough that we don't feel the need to connect Bluetooth speakers when we move it around. There's a fan that makes a faint whirring noise. I dropped it hard right as I opened the package, but the little fella seems pretty durable so far. I haven't tried gaming on it yet, if I do I may send an update. So far it's exceeded my expectations.",

                "reviewText": "It's a very small and portable projector that's good for a small apartment like ours. As soon we turned it on our cat tried to play with the projected light.The main thing that got to me was the loudness and bass of the speaker is really good and great if you're hosting and it's on your coffee table. It really shines when it's darker or when the sun sets and you can tell it's very good quality. It isn't too good for the daytime. The fan is audibly present when on but not noticeable when watching things. When gaming on it there isn't much of a buffer as well. The thing that got me was that you can Bluetooth connect to this thing to stream and it's super user friendly! You don't have to have all these other apps for stuff you just watch straight away out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "I've used multiple projectors. For the money, this might be the best option. Especially if you use a samsung phone. It will autofocus to any surface while maintaining a crystal clear image. I've used it for movies, sketching outlines, a speaker, and other things. It does it all and can control it all from your phone.TO RECAP: a fantastic option for the price if you want an all in one, app included, compact projector",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased projectors and screens previously and most had bad audio, questionable image quality and were themselves too loud. This projector has great audio and makes almost no noise from the fan but I chose this one because the auto keystone feature since I have limited placement options in a newly rehabbed area of the basement I wanted to make a cinema room (but still have the ability to move screen out of the way to just have decorated wall).The image quality is very good even at 90%. I purchased a 100\u201d screen for the exterior stone wall and from 12\u2019 away the projector looks best around 85% for my size but works well at 90%. Over 7 foot wide image!The preset apps for streaming and live tv give me everything I have on my Samsung tv and controlling it with the remote (solar, but would be nice IF usbC charging cable was included). It connected fine to my iPhone to control the projector as well as share screen. I also purchased a micro hdmi cable to connect my MacBook to screen without issue. I haven\u2019t moved a gaming system down yet but assume it will work fine with the micro cable.The image quality is very good for a projector in this price point. It\u2019s bright AS LONG AS you can control ambient light in your room. It would be nice if you could better control the brightness but as long as I keep windows covered and keep lights off it\u2019s beautiful. As I mentioned, it\u2019s over 7 foot wide image so that with good resolution is the wow factor for this projector.Overall I\u2019m thrilled, however, it is annoying that I have to reset the projector every single time I turn it on. I can\u2019t permanently mount it high because every time I start it, the keystone is off and the size is off (even if the menu says it\u2019s at 85% it\u2019s not, it\u2019s at 100%) and to correct this I have to turn the projector to a side wall, allow it to reset keystone and focus and THEN turn it back to my screen to do the process again. And even then, I often have to do this more than once and unfortunately 90% of the time, the adjustment in the menu are unresponsive. I select screen size and nothing changes, I select keystone manual adjustments and nothing happens. Every 10th time I try this it might work but mostly it doesn\u2019t. It could be the lag is too great and my patience is too short\u2026but this is a problem I thought would be corrected by the version update. It was bad enough that I am still considering the idea of returning it. The only reason I haven\u2019t is that I doubt I will find a projector with the other features at this price so I\u2019m just playing the game and doing the dance to get it fine tuned the way it should be. Overall I\u2019m still very pleased with image and sound quality and you can\u2019t beat the size!",
