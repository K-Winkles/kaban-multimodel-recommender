Things to note tho, you will need to spend a lot of time tinkering with your set up to get it just right. I have had this for about two months and used it once a week religously. This thing runs off a battery pack and is completly portable. You do have to be in a very dark place for the best quality picture but it works in a dimmly lit room as well. The built in speaker is ok if you are alone inside but if you intend on using this in a group setting or out side you will need a speaker and an aux chord. It does not excel at video playlists, even if the files are in alphabetical order it just wants to play random videos. All in all its a great product if you are willing to spend some time making it work for you.",

Worse yet the text on the screen is blurry making it hard to even figure out how to set the thing up. I bought an HDMI to USB C cable for my Galaxy Note 8 to project Netflix on to my wall. Didn't work at all. When I connected the cable to my phone some Samsung program called Dex showed up but the screen was so blurry I could not see what the directions were for use. I eventually figured out how to mirror my screen and started up Youtube to test it. It played at like 5 frames a second, stuttering and skipping terribly. Anyway, it's not at all worth the money and no matter what people tell you here you're not going to like it if you think you're going to watch a movie on it. Don't bother with this and just buy a real projector.",

The picture quality is acceptable, but not perfect. If you want perfect picture quality, you will need to pay a lot more for a projector. The sound is not very loud, would recommend hooking it up to a speaker.",

The reason I bought it was to watch Netflix and Hulu but not even that would work unless you buy another cable that was like $16. Even if I bought the cable I would only be able to watch YouTube :\u2019( the screen quality sucks too, if you want it to look good you would have to put the screen up close to the wall. super sad and will definitely be returning and buying something better or just a tv \ud83d\ude44",

                "reviewText": "I think this product is very much worth the money !!!! However, there are a few things you need to know before buying this. You will need to purchase an HDMI cord ( along with a few other things ) if you don\u2019t have them lying around your house. The sound on this machine is VERY quiet, so you\u2019ll need to connect your own speakers as well. It\u2019s a really cute product, it just takes a lot of set up if you\u2019re planning a fun movie night !! It might be worth the $60-80 more to buy a higher end projector. But this is a great product overall !!",
