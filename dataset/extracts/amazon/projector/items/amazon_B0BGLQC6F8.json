                "reviewText": "I have used a projector just about every single night for the last 5 years wow outside on my deck.This is by far the best mini projector I have seen. Incredibly easy to use right out of the box You just plug it in and there you go. You're done.You have to choose what language you want to use with the opening screen and then it takes you to the input screen where you can set the projector up to your preferences such as size of the display I simply use the default which I believe is 16x9. You could also change the variables such as color volume and other personal preferences. On that same opening screen you can choose both your input source and output source. I did not use the USB media port at any time because it was just too much ever to take a fire stick out of my TV in the house and bring it outside but I'm sure it would work flawlessly as everything else did on this projector. I connected it to my HDMI portal my laptop as I do with my other projector every night and have done for the last 4 years on several different projectors that I own. Immediately when I chose a 4K program through YouTube the clarity and quality of this picture became evident. The picture was absolutely incredible and for demonstration I showed the fish and underwater scenes which are posted here. This picture quality is actually equal to My large format projector that I use most every night. I'm outside on my deck seven nights a week rain or shine hot or cold because I have a retractable awning and I like cold weather! It is incredibly bright and they mentioned 12,000 lumens I am not sure if that is accurate. I'm not sure but you would actually have to have a meter to judge and it's every bit as good as my larger more expensive projector. Honestly the picture quality is just about as good as my 4K television in the living room and that was surprising. I don't have an iPhone so I tried Miracast from my Samsung to the projector with ease. Of course I never read the owners manual for this because I've been doing this for several years with other projectors and of the controls are very similar.The machine is definitely solid and very well built which the quality of the build seem to be better than any mini projector I have. I didn't have any need to adjust the color or saturation of the picture because it was just fine straight out of the box but all those things can be adjusted in the settings.I did briefly use the DLNA function but only to test its compatibility with my laptop by streaming some music. It worked very well but in order to use it you must have Windows 10 or 11 a compatible laptop or device and a compatible modem that supports the DLNA protocol. I on a Hitron CODA DOCSIS 3.1 modem which is certified for use with Comcast Charter Spectrum Cox etc and can be found for under $100. My Xfinity cable box is DLNA capable but I just haven't gotten around to try that yet though I'm sure it will work just as well on this machine as it does on my other projector.. and the photos you will see the size comparison between my current full size projector with this projector sitting on top.Overall I don't think you could possibly find a better many projector for even twice the price. I have seven projectors in my home right now that I've used at one time or another and this is by far one of the best overall I've ever had. Small it's portable and convenient you can simply carry it anywhere you want to go in order to use it at a friend's house or at church or what have you. One of my favorite features though is it has an actual lens cap! The lens will be protected every time you put it away No need to worry which also means you won't have to clean the lens nearly as much as with other many projectors that don't have a lens cap and that's a definite plus for me.If you're having a hard time deciding which many projector to buy I promise you if you buy this many projector at this incredible price you will not be disappointed!",

It has worked flawlessly with our Firestick as well as the PS4. I can't attest to the standalone sound because we have a soundbar hooked up it. My only complaint is that the fan is a bit loud.",
