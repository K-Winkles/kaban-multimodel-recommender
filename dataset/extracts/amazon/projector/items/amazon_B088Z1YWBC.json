                "reviewTitle": "Good projector at this price range",
                "reviewText": "We took a whole week to observe its performance.After a week of use here are our observationsPros:- This is the most affordable projector at this price range. It works GREAT!- The picture quality is quite GOOD. According our room size (10x10 ft) we are almost getting a 95-100 inch image. Accompanied with an external 5.1 Surround Sound system we are enjoying a theater like experience. No doubt!- Connected via HDMI to a laptop the performance is flawless. Picture is nice and clear.- Plug and play projector. No need to install anything.- Brightness, Contrast, Saturation and Sharpness adjustments- The remote works just fine with its simple buttons and operations (it takes 2 'AAA' batteries. Not included in the package)- Native Full HD projection (1920 X 1080) 60Hz refresh rate- Projects well on a clean white wall. We are not using any special projection screen- Even after 5-6 hours of use the projector wasn't that hot- Works very well in a dark room. Just like a theater- Light weight. Can be carried if you're traveling- Front projection, Rear projection optionsCons:- The keystone adjustment is USELESS!!! When adjusted the edges are blurred.- The lens's protective cap becomes useless after setting up the desired focus. Because according to my viewing distance (9-10ft) when focused, the lens completely goes inside the projector body providing NO support for the lens cap to put back on. So in order to put the lens cap back on after use we have to dial back the lens again which changes our focus setting. We have to focus again next time. This is VERY annoying.- Because of the useless keystone adjustment the projector had to be placed next to us. Because of our viewing height preference it is almost at our ear level, next to us. So we hear the noise of the projector. We use an external 5.1 sound system for sound output. But still this noise is a bit disturbing while watching quiet scenes in a movie.- The power connection of the projector is on its back side. So the projector's back cant be easily rested against a wall. It has to be 2-3 inches away from the wall.Other things:- An HDMI cable along with the package would be nice- We are using an external sound system so we didn't test the projector's built-in sound output- Haven't tested the 4K support. Full HD projection at a viewing distance of 9-10ft gives an image size of 95-100 inch is good enough for usOverall.. we are satisfied with it. It's a great product at this price range. It works simple and provides a good quality experience (so far).",

                "reviewText": "Its very tricky to focus. But if u get it right, its just awesome. Not only for movies its great for ppt presentation also. Those guys who are saying its not proper for ppt, they haven't got the trick yet. To get a screen of 80 inch you need to place the projector at a distance of about 8.5 feet from the screen.Pros1. You can get nearly max 7x5 feet screen with clear focus. Almost 100 '' of screen experience with it.2. U can modify the picture quality by changing settings. Few people are saying that picture is bit pixeleted of type from near view. But it can be easily nullified by changing the picture mode. Even u can nicely control sharpness, brightness contrast.3. U can watch your cable tv or dish tv with it. You just need to plugin av cables which are already attached with the box.4. Remote is working very fine. Evrything are there in it. You can do all functionalities with this remote.5. You can mount it on any standard camera tripod. See my uploaded pictures.6. There are no such hitting problem and noice like other projector of this price range.7. It has hdmi port, vga in, usb port, +5v power usb out, sd card slot, av in, audio out and evrything are working fine.Cons** The most important thing is that there is no service center available outside gaziabad. I came to know this gaziabad one is even very aweful. So if there are any issue, you have to repair it from local thechnitian. Don't know how long its gonna last. So investing in it means like trying your luck in cards.1. Cant focus whole screen, if you try to project it beyond 7*5 feet scree. Though you dont need a screen beyond 7*5 feet in home.2. Projector inbuilt sound is not good atall. You need an external sound system.3. Av cables which are given with the projector are of very cheap quality and not gold plated also.4. Built quality is not at satisfactory level.5. Focussing the screen is very tricky and not smooth. Doesn't hv autofocus.6. To increase or decrease the screen size you need to change the distance of projector from screen.Will give more detail later...",

                "reviewTitle": "Egate Projectors are Mediocre, and they have a useless Service Support. Please avoid!",
                "reviewText": "This is my second Egate Projector (I had Egate I9 Pro before this). I bought it at INR 22k after doing a lot of research and comparing many brands. My requirements are a projector that we can watch even during the day because we do not own a TV.Pros:1. Easy Setup - There is nothing to setup to be honest as this is not an Android projector. The only thing to be setup was the Keystone correction, which is pretty easy with the remote2. Excellent brightness - It has the best brightness of any projector I have used so far. So much so that we could watch it during daytime with curtains drawn, with as much light in the room that you could eat or the kids can play3. Picture Quality - It could have been better but it is OK, quite comparable to the cheaper models like i9 pro4. Digital Keystone correction - It works well, something it's predecessors missedCons:1. Bulky - It is big in size, i.e. not quite portable as it will not fit in your usual laptop bag2. Interface - It's boring, they haven't upgraded much since I bought the i9 pro in 2017. Other brand projectors such as Wanbo have a better interface which looks more professional3. Keystone Correction - The physical keystone correction has the same problems that its predecessors like i9 had, the corners get blurred if you use physical correction4. Sound - Could have been better. It's better than the cheaper eGate projectors but not enough to watch a movie in hall, it's only sufficient for a small room5. USB Play - It did not play a lot of formats, even most 1080 MP4s and gave unsupported format error, which reminded me of the irritating same problem with the i9. I expected better from L9To be honest, I expected more from a projector costing 22k. The only marginal advantage I got was the brightness so that I can watch it during daytime. The worse part is it will always need a physical input because it is not Android and doesn't support Miracast/screen-share, not even a damn bluetooth so you need another output for sound; so hanging this from the ceiling is another pain. I bought i9 for INR5500 and it gave me 1080 picture, with the drawback that it needed complete darkness for good experience, however as a projector it did what it should for that amount; though it had a shoddy build quality and its polarization filter got burnt in an area within an year, and Egate customer care did not respond in time, by then my warranty had run out. I ordered a Wanbo X1 pro (INR12k) before this and it had better interface, with Miracast and Bluetooth so using it was a charm compared to this.So, buy this only if you have a requirement of using it in daytime, if you plan on watching few movies etc in a dark room, buy a cheaper one because that will do the job.After 11 months of use, it has started showing a dark spot on screen, which is visible in low light scenes. The same problem happened with their earlier projector Egate i9, but it was a much cheaper item and it happened after 2-3 years of use, and Egate was relatively a small company then, so it was somewhat acceptable. But given the giant it has become in the field of projectors, such performance is not acceptable at all. Moreover, they have a pathetic after sales support, with no one even responding to complaints.So, please avoid this and buy a Chinese made projector in same price range, they offer much better quality for this price.",
