                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A great projector for a great price",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a great projector for the money. I got it on sale for $350, but even at the original $500 it would be a good product. The only other projector I've used was much lower quality than this and the brightness and resolution of this product blows the other one out of the water.Here are some of the reasons for this 5 star rating:The auto focus and keystone is great. I have the projector at an angle due to the layout of my apartment, and the auto keystone picked it up right away and gets it just right. Also if you bump it and it goes out of focus or keystone then it fixes it right away.The resolution is good. I'm not really that picky about resolution but my last projector was much lower than this and so I needed the upgrade for use with my ps5.The brightness is also great: I could have the blinds open on a sunny day and still see the screen pretty well. Yeah it's obviously better with the curtains closed and in a dark room, but it does surprisingly well in a bright room. The pictures don't make it look super bright because I have bright lights on and the walls I'm projecting onto are not white or smooth, but I promise it's bright enough to get the job done and then some. Also the projected images shown arent that bright anyway, since they're backgrounds on the ps5 menu (don't mind the mess, I just moved haha). I've had this projector since mid December of 2022 so I can't speak to the bulb longevity but so far it's been great.This has built in wifi and Bluetooth, so I can cast my phone to it with wifi and I can connect to my soundbar via bt so I don't have to run a long aux cord. I haven't used the casting function yet, but if it works as well as everything else then I'm sure it's good.Tech support: I had a dark spot appear on the lcd within the projector this week, so I contacted support and they informed me that it was because there wasn't enough clearance on the side for ventilation, and as a result the screen was overheating. I was originally wanting a replacement product within warranty, and they were willing to, but when they gave me a potential fix I decided to try it and then when it worked I kept it. Also, they told me how to set it so when I turn on the projector, it goes directly to my hdmi input and not the menu where I have to manually select the input. That was helpful because it was annoying to select it every time.The built in speaker is also pretty good for a built in speaker. I haven't gotten around to setting up my soundbar yet after moving and the built in speaker has been working just fine for the meantime for general streaming and such.My one complaint with this product is that the remote doesn't work super well, but it works well enough and it's not nearly a big enough of an issue to take away a star. I just have to point it directly at the projector and be a little more intentional with it and it gets the job done.",

                "reviewText": "This is not my first projector, but it is one of my favorites! The box comes with essentially everything you need to get started: an HDMI cable, component to S-video cable, and remote. Here's a list of pros and consPros:- Auto-focus and auto-keystone ensures that you have a perfect image every time! It's pretty amazing watching it fix the screen shape and size.- Very bright projector for the price. Picture attached is with our lights on in the room and the colors still look great! (not washed out)- Speakers are surprisingly loud. We have a dedicated speaker for the projector and actually don't use it because the in built speakers are great. Sometimes too loud, so we have to turn it down.- Unlike other projectors, the UI is not terrible! Along with iOS, Android, and PC wifi casting options, there's a good amount of customization for picture settings (brightness, saturation, exposure, hue, etc) and sound balance options. Used these to calibrate the colors on the projector with my projector screen and a calibration tool on my computer.- I have this projector always connected to a computer so one of my favorite features is that I can set the projector to automatically auto-focus, auto-keystone, and move to HDMI1 right after booting up- Support is responsive and helpful (as stated in my last con)Cons:- Remote is not the most sensitive, but works when pointing in the general direction of the projector- On-screen keyboard is missing a few special symbol characters, which I use in my WiFi password. However, after a quick email to the Yaber Support team, they are working on a firmware update to include the extra special characters on the keyboard! Super happy to have such a quick turnaround from support.Overall, I am super happy with the projector. Compared to all of the other projectors in this price range, I think it is a great bang for the buck; even more if it is on sale!",

Initially without lights then lights on and then off. You can judge yourself.My Projector is placed at 6ft height 12ft from the wall and Diagonally.I would recommend to place it in straight line so both sides are clear.Pros-Very easy to use.In built speakers are nice for a room.Quality of image is good without lights and with lights its not that good just like any other projector.It has 2 hdmi ports and you need to connect fire stick, ps5 or anything to play on it.Also you can Mirror your phone.I am writing this review after using it for 3months.I am goona buy it again after watching on this you cant watch on tv.I am using the projector on plain white wall, also i have used it on Dark Grey black out curtain and i feel the images are much sharper on that.Overall an excellent product. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffcI recommend it.",
