NOTE:The diffuse reflectance principle of projectors means that they are subject to ambient light. Expensive commercial projectors are typically used during the day, so most of the budget is allocated to brightness. Home projectors are more oriented towards improving picture quality and color. Although the ONO1 projector is already brighter than other projectors in the same range on the market, I recommend using it in a dimly lit environment to enjoy the immersive atmosphere of watching a movie with the best results.(as if you were in a movie theater.)",

The Customer Service is Outstanding, and very effective plus Responsive. And it has Bluetooth, WiFi, and Easy Keystone adjustments. Built in Speaker is adequate (but blue tooth it to an external one for truly amazing sound). Can also Mirror my iPhone effortlessly! It certainly needs a dark-ish room... my media room has no windows, and is perfect for this projector. It is certainly not as bright as a LED TV, but overall experience is awesome! And Value is A+If you want a budget Projector, this one is IT!!",
