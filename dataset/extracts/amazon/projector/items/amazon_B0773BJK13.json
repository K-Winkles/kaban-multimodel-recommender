Please be prepared to spend some time in carefully adjusting color combinations and brightness contrast in the beginning to get the best image out of your projector.i liked the auto heat sensor feature where projector requests to shutdown after heating on long use to prevent getting spoilt. watching football is a real enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "There a bit of misinformation. This is a \u201cWiFi\u201d projector in that it connects to WiFi for updates, and a limited gamut of apps usable by its android operating system. It does NOT allow WiFi screen casting through miracast without a WiFi enabled dongle which connects through the HDMI port.There\u2019s no way use miracast as an input source, you only have the three options of hardware input ports: VGA, HDMI and USB. So it\u2019s not truly WiFi enabled.It\u2019s also not truly Bluetooth enabled. Now to be fair, I only wanted the WiFi for a sound bar connection, so for me it\u2019s working great. But it will not connect to a mobile device (at least I\u2019ve not been able to sort that one out.)It\u2019s also nowhere close to 7300 lumens. It might be 4000. It\u2019s pretty bright, but not 7000+ bright.With the misinformation aside, this is a fantastic projector for the money, and depending on what you need it for, it will serve you well. Assuming the bulb lasts, since I can\u2019t seem to open it, it should be a great projector for a long time. I\u2019m super excited to use it. It\u2019s got a crisp picture, and vivid color. That\u2019s also compared to the BenQ and epson projectors we use at our church.Other small annoyances FYI:You have to peel the feet off to get at the mounting holes, and there is a power toggle AND a button. Weird.Overall, great for the money! I\u2019m a happy customer! 4/5",

                "reviewText": "We love lots about this projector, BUT the most important thing - bluetoothing it to our iPhone, iPad, MacBook - which is claimed it could do in the pictures diagram - hasn\u2019t proved possible.Would love some help in this regard if we are to change our review. We are considering buying an Apple TV as we believe this may help. But needing to buy an external device would have been helpful before choosing this projector.Update: The company got back to me and said it does not have bluetooth capability EXCEPT to an external speaker. They apologized and said they updated the product listing to make sure it was more clear for everyone in the future. They are accepting my return (as this aspect of bluetooth was important to me) and I can't ask for anything more! While this wasn't the projector for me it could be for you. It was very bright and had a nice look to the picture we enjoyed. I didn't love the little buzz that came along with this projector (and I think is common in projectors) but I'm a music producer who has pretty sensitive ears. All and all seems like a good company with a good product. Just not for me :)",
