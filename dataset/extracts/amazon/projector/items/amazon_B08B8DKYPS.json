I have a loft bed (desk at the bottom with a bed on top), and whenever I would try to relax in bed and watch TV, I would have to look down since my TV is lower than my bed. One day I realized I had this large, blank area on my white wall that would be perfect for a projector. I finally decided on this projector and don't regret it at all. First off, it's super cute. I like the simple, clean design and bright pop of color makes me happy just looking at it(: It's also surprisingly tiny. I've never traveled with it, but can imagine its size being very convenient when traveling and making it very portable. Don't let the size fool you, though. This tiny projector packs a punch. The image is extremely clear and the sound that comes out of this small appliance is also shockingly powerful coming from such a small package. Not sure what else I can say about it. It's good quality. Good image, good sound, convenient size, and cute design. I regret not getting this sooner and if you're on the search for a projector, I can happily recommend this one.",

The idea was that this would be a gift for the whole family, and that we would use it in two different ways: 1. We could use it indoors for an enhanced movie-watching experience. 2. When the good days return, we could also plug in it for outdoor use in the backyard with an even bigger crowd.So far, we\u2019ve only been able to enjoy the projector for indoor use (it\u2019s winter!), but it was remarkably easy to set up, the sound was actually much better than I expected, and the image was really good quality just on a simple white sheet hanging off some shelves. My husband is usually quite picky when it comes to technology, and he was just as excited as the kids about this addition to our house. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase!",

The color yellow itself is lively, compared to other products with white or black body. The instruction is easy to read and follow, one thing that disappoints me is that it doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth function, and I have to carry extra HDMI with type c to connect with my laptop, but the price itself is reasonable. Would like to recommend to others!",

Ha un bell'aspetto a diverse distanze. Personalmente, l'ho messo abbastanza vicino perch\u00e9 sembra gigantesco e mi offre un'esperienza cinematografica imbattibile.L'audio \u00e8 molto buono, il che ci ha impressionato. Se sei preoccupato che il suono non provenga dalla parte anteriore, puoi collegare gli altoparlanti ma, personalmente, quando il volume \u00e8 al massimo, \u00e8 un suono che pu\u00f2 essere ascoltato in tutta la stanza e non ti rendi conto da dove proviene il suono (home theater!).Ha una copertura per proteggere lo schermo e, nella parte inferiore, una specie di vite per modificare l'angolazione del proiettore e orientarlo a piacere. Tua madre non vuole vedere il tuo film alle 2 del mattino? Non preoccuparti, puoi collegare delle cuffie ad esso!\u00c8 molto facile da usare, \u00e8 dotato di un telecomando che lo rende ancora pi\u00f9 comodo. \u00c8 possibile utilizzare i pulsanti del proiettore (in caso di smarrimento del telecomando). Si connette facilmente al Wi-Fi (se hai FireTV non \u00e8 necessario collegarlo al Wi-Fi).Abbiamo provato:- La condivisione dello schermo (diventa un lusso).- USB 2.0 da 64 GB (incredibile, ricorda che deve avere queste caratteristiche per poterlo capire).- HDMI (wow!)- FireTV (perfetto).Siamo particolarmente contenti perch\u00e9 tutto ci\u00f2 che abbiamo provato funziona alla grande, \u00e8 silenzioso, piccolo, carino e wow... un cinema in camera a un prezzo pi\u00f9 che ragionevole. Se vuoi vivere questa esperienza, non esitare un secondo e goditi il letto, il divano, il pouf, l'amaca... popcorn... azione!E in inverno, piattaforma cinematografica, copritevi e divertitevi.",
