                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great projector for the price, super clear and bright",
                "reviewText": "For ~$200 that I got this projector for, it is an absolute steal. It's obviously not as good as a $3000 4K laser projector or something like that, but it absolutely delivers everything I expected from it and more.The highlight of this projector is the image; I have mine set up about 12ish feet from the blank wall it projects onto and the display is huge and the image is super crisp as you can see in the photos. Also because the image is so bright, you can easily see everything on the screen even under bright light, although it obviously looks best in the dark. I attached a picture of it projecting a test image in the dark and with a bright lamp turned on for comparison. For size reference, the TV you can see in the brighter image is 48\", so the projected display size is about 100\" give or take.I usually use my cobbled together surround system for audio but figured I'd give the speakers a shot for the review, and they honestly really surprised me. While the output isn't as loud as you get from a dedicated system, it's perfectly sufficient if you aren't a stickler about that sort of thing. The range on the speakers is actually pretty decent too, voices still sound really good and the audio in general doesn't have the same tinny quality I can't stand from a lot of internal TV speakers because of the lack of low-range output. Also, this projector does have BlueTooth with which you can wirelessly connect your own speakers, which is super convenient if you plan on taking this to different places/environments.Another great feature that I like is the WiFi connectivity and wireless display streaming. While I probably wouldn't use it for gaming or anything that requires low input lag, it's perfectly fine for playing a movie or TV or the like from your computer or phone without cables. The only caveat is that you can't directly connect your computer to the projector wirelessly, they both have to be connected to the same WiFi network and communicate that way, at least with a Windows PC which is what I tested it with.Another great thing about this product is all the connectivity and media source options. I only use this in my living room so I only use the HDMI, but it also lets you play media directly from a USB device or SD card, and has an extra USB port for powering a streaming stick (Amazon Fire TV Stick, Roku, Chromecast, etc.) With the wireless display streaming, bluetooth connectivity, and all the input options, this projector is perfect if you need something you can move around and set up quickly without having to deal with a bunch of cables.The only real gripe I have is that the fan noise is kind of loud, but it fades into the background pretty quickly once you start playing something, and for this price point I really can't gripe too much especially since I was expecting to have more to complain about lol.Conclusion: If you're looking for a projector that has a bright, clear image and decent sound with a ton of extra features, you really can't find much better than this for the price. Would recommend 9.5/10.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using projectors for years and I have had many different brands and have paid a lot of money for some of them ranging from 500.00 to 1200.00. This projectors brightness and quality of picture is right up there with the projectors that cost over a 1,000 dollars if not better than them. I got this projector for indoor use but also a lot of outdoor use as well to enjoy the summer with my family and have our own drive in movie theater outside. This projector can project up too 400 inches which is amazing because of the very bright led inside that is running at 12,000 lumens it is like I am at the movie theater. It also has an air filter to protect the inside from dust or hair, if you have animals that stay in your house which is great because my previous projectors would have to be cleaned out at least once every few weeks but with this one I just have to pull the filter screen and clean it up and that's it. It came with all the wires including an HDMI cord and best of all it came with a stretchable cloth screen to hang up for an even better picture quality and also comes with a remote control and AV cord my favorite part about this projector is that is comes with 5g WiFi connection,built in casting and bluetooth. Now I can bluetooth my soundbar to the projector for even better sound but the projectors speakers inside are plenty loud enough to just use them if you don't have a bluetooth speaker to connect to. Also it has a TF card slot so you can put movies or tv shows on a little sd card and play your content from that. The first thing I used it on was my son's PS4 playing Fortnite which was super crisp and amazing vivid colors in the projection. I will do an update on this review when we have our yard drive in and once i play some great movies on it like my favorite Interstellar, I can't wait to watch it on this projector. I know this projector is going to be amazing outside just by seeing it display a ps4 game inside and one of the photos in my review you can tell it's brighter in the room because i opened my curtains and turned on all the lights in my living room and still the picture was bright and clear. If you are looking to buy a projector for your first time or just wanting to buy a new one to replace an old one I highly recommend this projector. For the price point and the high lumens that make for an amazing picture. Buy this and you will be using it more than your actual flat screen TV. \ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I had an older model of this projector and decided to try the newer model. Obviously this is not going to compete with the higher priced models for picture quality and features for its budget price point, but it satisfies the requirements of my intro home theatre setup. In order to play the sound thru my 5.1 surround sound system, I only tested the HDMI connection source. The picture is clear and bright and brings the enjoyment of movie night to my living room.The only disappointment is that on the old projector I was able to reduce the picture size to 79% while I am forced to move this projector closer to the screen to reduce the overall picture size for my 100\u201d screen. It forces the noise of the fan to be between me and screen versus behind my head. I look forward to using this projector for outdoor movies in the fall as we are officially in the triple digit weather of the desert.",
