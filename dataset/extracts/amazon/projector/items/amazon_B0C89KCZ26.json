I spent 2 hours going through all of the different ways to connect it to my computer and phone and ultimately it would not connect with my computer no matter what I did and once I got it to work with my phone it would freeze up when I went to stream anything. This was not a phone or wifi issue as it was playing everything perfectly fine until I connected it to the projector.

Sketchy 3rd party app that isn't on any app store, no pc support only phones, heated up quickly, focus ring wouldn't stay in place, would only connect via USB port, app would freak out before crashing, it would turn itself back on after turning off. Over all bad time, but the case of it is incredibly durable. Like it took 3 heavy swings with a mallet to get inside and pillage some goodies. Its made from nice parts and someone wanted this to be a good projector but the software is down right awful.",

I didn't use it for a month or so after i got it but when it'd plugged in and the slightest bumb will cause the plug in the back of the projector to slightly unplug just enough to shut it down. I have experienced this problem since I got it I just haven't had the time to sit down and write a review. I would return it if possible.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. FOSENHL mini projector has incredible detail for its small 4.33\" x 3.54\" x 1.96\" size. Weighing in at only 0.55 oz makes this mini projector a true portable cinema. This is so FUN to watch and share with others, especially if you have a movie on your smartphone ( see my Video example). This way others can watch too and not crowd in to peek on to your smartphone. Love the cinema type projection, not the standard \"box\" look while watching movies.Projector comes with power cord ( although power bank hook up makes this truly portable) and instruction guide.Out of the box, setup was a breeze. Log into Wifi and set smartphone/laptop to accept wireless devices, such as this FOSENHL projector.Travel, camping, on-the-go and more makes this an incredible pleasure to have and enjoy movies and more with friends.Priced right makes this a no-brainer to have as a part of your entertainment collection. I'm glad our family ordered this and highly recommend it!",
