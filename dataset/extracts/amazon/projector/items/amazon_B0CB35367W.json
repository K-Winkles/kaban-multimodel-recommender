                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Display quality is pretty good for a 720P projector, especially considering it's portable, has Wi-Fi with screen mirroring, decent sound, and all for under $100.Overall, it's a nice compact projector that comes with a lens cap and a carry bag, making it portable. The overall build quality looks and feels solid. It has great brightness and contrast, and works well even when the room is not dark. The sound quality is surprisingly good from the small speaker and playback is clear and it goes pretty loud.Once you have Wi-Fi setup, then phone screen mirroring or connecting via computer works very well. (I used it with an iPhone). Long-press the OK button on the projector to get into Wi-Fi settings, and setup the 2.4ghz Wi-Fi connection. You can also connect directly to the projector using its built-in Wi-Fi or simply use a cable.It's pretty simple to use through the onscreen menu and it offers several connection options from Wi-Fi, HDMI, USB and RCA. (HDMI and RCA cables are supplied).",

                "reviewText": "We use this projector for movie nights on our patio and absolutely love it. Few draw backs, we have to wait until it gets dark outside or at least dusk to watch a movie. It doesn't project well in bright light (like many other projectors). The other issue is we have to physically move the projector closer to or further away from the screen to make the picture larger or smaller. There should be a way to zoom in and out without having to literally move the machine, but that doesnt seem to be the case with this one. It only allows you to tilt the image up or down and bring into focus. If we want to fill the whole screen (ours is 120\"), we have to move the machine itself backwards away from the screen. Lastly, the projector is not very loud. We use a BT speaker for better volume and cinema experience.",

                "reviewText": "Good projector for the price point. I picked up this projector for upcoming Halloween projection onto a window and sheet. I decided to also give it a run in one of the rooms for movies. I was able to connect to it with windows 10 once I put in the wifi network pretty easily. It played without any hiccups or network issues. You have to have a good wifi network obviously. I then decided to give it a try using miracast on my android phone and setup again was pretty quick. At this price point its a great little compact projector. Colors were pretty good especially after tweaking them in the settings. Warm colors work better for movies. The only cons are type was a bit fuzzy on the edges and took some correcting. Correcting the focus and the keystone was a bit awkward since both dials are right next to each other. I was projecting on a wall with no screen. Projecting onto a screen should help with the text near the edges. Only other downside is I could not get my 3.0 usb to work. It worked fine with usb 2.0. I normally put Halloween mpeg files on a usb stick and then run the projector from a set time. Hopefully there will be a software upgrade for the usb compatibility in the future. Great projector for holiday projections.",
