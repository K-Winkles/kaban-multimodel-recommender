                "reviewText": "This is the first day so only time will tell, but I\u2019m impressed so far. Picture is much brighter and more clear than our older Vankyo V630. The Vankyo was a great first projector, but this GooDee YG600 Movin is definitely a step up. WiFi and Bluetooth hooked up seamlessly and work well so far. I have the sound playing through my Sony home theater system with no issues so far. The last budget projector did not want to cooperate with Bluetooth and the operating system would freeze up. I\u2019ve unplugged this projector once, and the Bluetooth reconnected as expected when powered back up. Netflix loaded fine, I have yet to try the Amazon prime. We generally use Roku, so the installed apps aren\u2019t a must have for us. Disney plus took some help from the manual to find, but I have not yet tried to sign in. The pictures I took are from 2:00 in the afternoon and my screen is next to French doors with light colored curtains. So plenty bright to watch during the day, can\u2019t wait to see it at night. The zoom feature and all other menu items are easy to find and use to set to your liking. If it holds up quality wise, I have no complaints at this price point.",

Seems absurd that they would omit that function. Furthermore, the image focus is inconsistent if the projector is at an angle, like being hung from a ceiling or sitting on a floor. You can get a clear image at the midpoint, but it is fuzzy along the upper and lower 25%.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First Amazon review, I always read other's reviews before I decide on a purchase and thought my findings on this product might help others. I contemplated a projector for a while but decided to try the GooDee plus having read other reviews. The specifications met my requirements and seemed very well priced. I wasn't expecting great quality with the lower price compared to other units but am very surprised. This projector is great. It was easy to set up, easy to add HDMI cable input and pair with phone, wifi etc.The image is great. Having never owned a projector I thought at this price range it would produce low-quality images. I was wrong its amazing, clear picture that was easily adjusted to get into focus and fit the size required. The images shown are on a white wall which was watchable. I then added a screen and the images are fantastic. The projector with a screen is great for movies and sports with no complaints from anyone so far. The dark room does provide a better viewing experience but is great in moderate light settings as well.The quality is good along with an easy to use remote. I'm sure extra money might improve some bits but at this price it is excellent. The only slight draw back was trying it with a console, however it was expected and not what it was purchased for.If you're looking for a cheaper priced projector give this a try I thought it was great, even the inbuilt sound was decent.I can't compare to others but it isn't too loud whilst running. If you use a bluetooth speaker there is a delay. However inbuilt speaker is fine or I use a 3.5 to soundbar which works very well.",

                "reviewText": "After spending a month on looking for a projector that provides quality at an affordable price, I decided to go with GooDee's YG600 model. A friend of mine owns the previous, YG500 model, and I can tell that there has been a major update since, both in the resolution (this one is a WXGA projector) and the brightness of the light source.The photos attached were taken with a smart phone. The second picture shows how the image is like with night light on (6W LED, comparable to a 40W standard bulb). As one can see, the image still has enough contrast to it. In a dark environment, it truly renders a cinema experience.There are several options available in the menu. Amongst others, one can set the colour temperature (there are preset options, such as cold, standard, warm), colour balance (e.g., dynamic, user defined), there are audio filters that boost bass if needed (the audio quality is pretty decent given that the projector has only two 3W speakers; one is seemingly dedicated to drive bass; altogether, they fill a room with no problem), and one can also set date, time and sleep timer.As for the quality of the image, the resolution of the LCD panel of the projector is the same as that of a standard 13\"-15\" monitor. At a projected size of 100\" (the one claimed to be the optimal), one can enjoy HD contents without losing detail. I found that there are two useful contrast options: standard and dynamic. The former gives a bit more detail to the picture, whereas the latter stretches the contrast, making bright parts of the image stand out and deepening dark areas. Also, with dynamic contrast and adjusted, slightly reduced green tint and raised red level, the colours are very close to how my computer's screen renders them with calibrated colour profile. Please mind that the Keystone correction is optical, so the edges of the picture may be blurry when projected at an angle. This, however, is known to affect all similar projectors (just like slight chromatic aberration around the edges does).The fan of the projector is of course audible, but it is in no way disruptive. The tiny holes in the front panel are not just part of the stylish design but also help heat dissipation. The fans seem to cool the device efficiently, pumping out a lot of hot air (while leaving the case itself cold to touch). I am sure it prolongs the life of the light source.As for the in-built OS, the OSD seems to have been translated to many languages, but there is room for improvement. I could not find an option for changing the volume; one could change it though using the remote control. Also, while the device plays MKV files with no problem, I could not seem to find an option for changing the language of the subtitles shown. Should one use a computer or a media stick to stream content, these issues do not emerge; they might, however, if one plans to play media files from a micro SD card or via USB.On balance, I think this is the best projector currently available on the market in terms of quality/price.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this projector about 3 weeks ago now and couldn\u2019t be happier with our purchase. This is our second GooDee projector, we fancied an upgraded model as we have had our old one since 2019. This projector is slightly smaller than our last one which is great as it looks a lot less bulky. The quality is amazing, Bluetooth feature is great as we connect it to our two Marshall speakers and literally feels like we have a cinema in our house. Picture is great, can use in the room even if it isn\u2019t dark and can still see everything clearly. Easy to set up and put away, come with a travel case to you can take with you easily. Comes with all attachments you need. Great purchase, we won\u2019t ever go back to a TV again. Highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my BenQ, which was 800x600 and not LED. I thought for the price I'd give it a go and if it wasn't great I'd let the kids use it in their room for disney movies, etc. But to my surprise, the quality of this is actually really good. The build quality is quite impressive considering the cost. I've not really used the built in speaker much, just a quick test, but It sounded loud and clear enough for general use. The resolution of this projector is great, far better than 800x600. The LED light source is bright enough, even in a room with lights on. The only time I couldn't see it very well was when the sun was coming directly through the window. This projector has a manual keystone adjustment, which works ok but if you have the projector too high or too low relative to the centre of your chosen \"screen\", you can't get the top or bottom as sharp as the rest. I mounted it level to the centre of my screen, 5 meters away and the picture is super sharp in the centre and pretty sharp everywhere else, even in the corners. Colours are great. Good contrast and brightness. the cooling fan's not very loud either, once you're into the movie, you don't even notice it.**Update**I've now been using this projector for nearly 2 years. I still can't fault it, for the price it has been more than worth it. It has been used regularly (every other day) and there has not been any issues with it at all! I want to purchase a 1080P projector, but I really cant justify it as there is nothing wrong with this one and full HD would only be slightly better, so I'll stick with this one just now! Maybe just wait for a 4K version...For the price, I really have nothing bad to say about it. It even comes with a lens cap which my BenQ didn't at more than twice the cost! Definitely worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "As we like to travel in our teardrop caravan and watch movies I did alot of research into portable projectors that would be bright enough for outdoor use. I wasnt looking for one with a built in battery as we have several leisure batteries so power isnt a problem, incidentally it uses around 110kwh. I was not disappointed with the goodee, it has a decent brightness, decent picture. Comes in a nice case. I had no problem pairing it with my bluetooth headphones for outdoor use. This is a great bit of kit for the price. I have even started using it at home as it is much quieter than my existing home projector.",
