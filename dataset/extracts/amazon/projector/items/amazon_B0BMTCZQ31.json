                "reviewText": "I use this projector all the time in my dorm room. It\u2019s super light and easy to use. Whether that\u2019s to watch a horror movie on my wall with a couple of my friends or to play some Mario kart on a bigger screen than I can fit in my tiny area. I would highly recommend this for any college students looking to watch or play games in their dorm when they don\u2019t have enough space for a tv.",
