Does the projector connect to mobile phones? Yes, the projector can be connected to phones. You will need to use an adapter (not included) that connects to your phone. Why can't my phone use the Bluetooth function to connect to the projector? The Bluetooth function is only used for audio transmission with audio devices and does not support video synchronization with smartphones and computers. Smartphones and computers cannot be connected to the projector using Bluetooth. I want to give this projector as a gift to my child, but I'm wondering if the size is too big? This mini projector has been reduced in size but upgraded with a projector lens for a clearer projection. The mini size is perfect for gifting to children.",
