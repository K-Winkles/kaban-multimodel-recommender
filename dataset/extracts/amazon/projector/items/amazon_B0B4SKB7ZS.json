Make sure you buy a good stand to get the best quality. The projector works excellent in tandem with my play station and my switch. It connects to Bluetooth pretty easily (although I don\u2019t use it often). It\u2019s a handy projector perfect for the college student who doesn\u2019t have the space to carry around a large tv during frequent moves.Mine did manage to develop a blue overlay as I used it more but it became more noticeable when the screen is pitch black.

The brightness works very well in my semi-light controlled room (dark curtains on windows).After awhile there was an issue with the projector and I needed to contact the manufacturer, they were very responsive and worked to get it fixed right away.",

                "reviewText": "This projector is a budget-friendly gem! The picture quality is surprisingly good for the price, making movie nights at home enjoyable. However, there was a minor sound issue initially. The replacement process, though a bit delayed, was hassle-free, and the new unit works perfectly. It's now a fantastic addition to our kids' play area. The compact size and ease of use make it a hit for impromptu movie sessions. Despite the initial hiccup, the value for money and its entertainment factor make this projector a solid choice, especially for a kid-friendly setup.",

The system itself is very user friendly. could be set up to be hung from ceiling or use projector stand. The sound on the projector itself is decent. However, you do have the option to connect Bluetooth speakers or surround sound. I currently use it as my tv and the constant daily use has not wornout the system itself. I did recently run into a snag with the projector however Yowick customer service was phenomenal. They were quick to respond and inform me that with purchase of projector comes with an automatic 2 year warranty and provided me multiple options as for solutions. Thank you Faye. Definitely made me want to stay loyal to them and their products. Ten out of ten would recommend. Happy shopping.",

We have hooked up to a roku, a DVD player, the kids games, and our phones, and never had a problem.There was a small light spot in the center after about 9 months. We contacted customer service and they sent out a new one within a week!! And they were so nice, no hoops to jump thru, we just sent a picture of the issue, and done.I will definitely by this projector again, and will go through this seller again!",

                "reviewText": "I bit on this item based on the price and reviews, but I think a savvy buyer should have proper expectations set. If this is your first purchase of a digital projector, then you have zero expectations, and then this product is probably fine. If however, you\u2019ve used products from known brands (the types sold in technology oriented box stores) then this thing is just a toy. I purchased it based on price and reviews to replace a ten year old projector from a known global brand. I wanted the built in WiFi and Bluetooth but the image quality and brightness pale in comparison to my current, and well outdated tech, despite the description on Amazon. To suggest this thing dishes out 1080 is a stretch and 4K is laughable (although, I\u2019m not thinking that\u2019s possible from any projector to be fair). It\u2019s fine for the kids to watch cartoons, but if you want a real cinema experience, look elsewhere. Again, to be fair, I may have had unrealistic expectations for $130 bucks. My current projector was probably $500+ on sale.",

I just don't understand the mirror feature and don't got time to waste on it. 2 was the sound. I fixed this after awhile of brainstorming lol dummy moment. Uh i went to settings for sound and turned off each stereo input. It worked after i turned off dolby. Other than that just get the cheaper one without the wifi if you looking for no nonsense. Just added this a week after I bought it. This projector got a star back because I noticed during the day the screen looks just as good as night. Last projector I had it absolutely had to be dark. Or it would be a glare but this one no prob can watch in any lighting",
