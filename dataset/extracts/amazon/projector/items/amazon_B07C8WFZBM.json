                "reviewText": "Great little device so far. I\u2019ve used it for a few hours and these are my first impressions. First the startup procedure needs better instructions. Device arrived with zero charge, a *tiny* footnote in the instructions reveals that this means the device will not function. Even if plugged in, it requires about half an hour to charge to a level where it will power up. This would be a nice piece of information to include in the instructions. Otherwise, seems great. Brightness and resolution are superb for a device of this size/class. Certainly not competition with a full size projector, but not exactly dead last in the running. Even with my semigloss painted wall, it looks pretty decent. Brightness is solid, watched a movie and tv show with no issues. No excessive heat buildup after three hours of use. There is a nice focus adjustment that works well. The device automatically corrects for the \u2018keyhole\u2019 effect which is also nice. I used it at varying distance with no issues or real loss of quality up to about 9 feet. After that and the device is simply not strong enough of a projector. Built in speaker works but is pretty crummy as expected for a device of this size. Overall worth the money in my opinion, better instructions would be nice and packaging is kinda annoying. They give you a sleeve for the device but that\u2019s it. A zippered pouch for the cables would be a nice touch for this price point. I\u2019ll write a follow up review in a few months. I travel frequently so we will see how it holds up.-M",

Nifty little gadget and great enough to connect iPhone and watch a movie and watch it against the white wall in my room.I love the focus setting which helps the pictures turn up sharp.Took it to Canada and replayed the videos we took while traveling through.Battery life is about 2 hours. That\u2019s about enough I can handle in a day staying at a screen.Included is a nice leather case which slides through the sides of the player.Product feels like it\u2019s made from good quality materials. It is kinda heavy which I like.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE 1/10/21This little projector has been my traveling companion for about two years and I have learned to live with its quirks. It is surprisingly bright, works well in a camper or tent, and has a nice case. The speaker is pathetic, however, and the device you are outputting on will send the audio down the HDMI cable if you aren\u2019t also running to a bluetooth speaker. With an external bluetooth speaker, you have about 90 min before the battery runs out. Plugging it into a USB-C port with the included cable gives you a bit more run time, but it eventually runs out of juice. As a result, it does not work well as a permanent install. As a portable, I can\u2019t imagine it getting much smaller. It has a very basic menu function using a single unlabeled button. It would be nice to be able to control things like audio or more in depth video functions, but all you get is normal and vivid picture. There is also a manual focus slider that is very sensitive. It is either in focus or it isn\u2019t - no middle ground. If you need to give a presentation of an hour or less, this is your projector, but it needs more configuration settings to be truly a workhorse.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This little projector works well for basic viewing, but needs some tweaks to make it a five star product.First up is picture quality. It's pretty good. I would really like better adjustment controls to be able to fine-tune the picture, but Sony didn't provide any. The picture controls will all need to be done on whatever device you have connected to the projector. This isn't horrible, just annoying.Second is power. Battery life is really good considering what it's used for. The projector does heat up but not so much that you will smell burning plastic or worry that it will burn you or anyone that touches it. Sony's device also requires USB-C to charge. While it does come with an adapter to charge using standard USB, don't lose it. If you choose to buy this projector (which really is a decent projector), go ahead and buy a back-up charging cord.Another problem with this projector is the speaker quality. Due to the size of this projector there's not really any room for a decent sound system, and it shows. Luckily you can pair this with an external bluetooth speaker for better sound quality. The audio controls are also limited which makes fine tuning not really possible.To make this an incredible portable projector, it would need more/better adjustments for keystone, color temp and other settings, As a simple projector, it works fine.",

The charge lasts for about 1 HR and without giving any signal it shuts down. Then, it takes at least an hour to charge for using another 15 to 20 mins. The greatest defect I would say it cannot be used while charging. Though somebody mentioned that it can be put to use while charging but in my case I cannot do so. For short time use the projector is good but for using it to watch a movie (about 2 hrs) it's a challenge as you have to give too many breaks for charging the projector.",
