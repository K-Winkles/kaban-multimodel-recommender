                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So I've been using this projector for a little over a month now and it has exceeded my expectations.",
                "reviewText": "VisualsThe coloring, lighting, and the appearance of the images are near perfect for a projector of this price range. The corners of the screen aren't blurred and the captions/subtitles are easy to read. DVD Player and remoteI tested the DVD player out andeverything works just like a normal DVD player. I am able to press pause, stop, skip, and go back to whatever scene that I was watching on with a click of the remote. The remote, is a basic dvd player styled remote that uses 2 batteries to control the projector. Nothing special about it, just a normal remote.NoiseThe noise level from the fan though is not as great as it can be. I have a cheaper projector from this company and the fan sounds just about the same.The audio is great though. It is louder than I thought, and the sound is crisp, clear and a little like surround sound. You can also hook up a separate speaker via bluetooth. Connections I connected a roku stick and it was very easy to set up. I was also able to connect my phone to the roku so that I can watch movies, shows, anime, live news and use apps like Youtube, Netflix, and Tubi, from my phone to the projector. Basically, this is like a little tv in my room. The projector also connects to gaming consoles like the Nintendo switch. My family and I were able to play multiplayer games on it without any issues, overheating, or lagging.Inside the boxInside the box, it comes with some connecting wires like a hdmi cable if you want to screenshare your laptop. It also comes with a cleaning wipe, qtip cleaning sticks, and a small screw driver to help you clean the lens properly. It comes with instructions too which is handy if you're not familiar with projectors or need help with something.AppearanceI'm a big fan of black & white tech so the appearance and aesthetic of this in my room looks great. The knob to adjust the clarity of the screen (the black ring around the lens) functions well and isn't unappealing when all the way out which for me, is a plus to have something that works well and has a great design.TMY Customer ServiceI have been speaking to the representative Susi via email and they have been very kind, understanding, and accomodating to what I have asked them. I had a issue with the remote that came with another projector I purchased and they were quick to respond with a solution to my issue (gave me a new remote cause the one i had wasn't connecting/working properly)ConThe one thing I wish it had was a way to adjust the screen to my wall in my room. To make the screen bigger or smaller, you have to physically grab and move the projector to get that perfect size. Since my room is small the screen doesn't fit and is bent so that part of the screen is on the wall and on the ceiling. Other than that I haven't found any other flaws. Mind you that I have mostly used this indoors in a bedroom at night. (company reached out to offer a free projector for a honest review)",

                "reviewText": "I am writing this review about the TMI 9500 lumens projector with a built-in DVD player.I was offered this product for free in exchange for writing a review on Amazon. I've been offered such products in the past and refused to post a review on Amazon if I felt I could not give the product five stars.I feel comfortable giving this product five stars as long as certain things are kept in mind.The first thing to keep in mind is that you should not expect a Lamborghini if you're paying for a Chevy Malibu, nor vice-versa. Each one has its purpose, its strengths, its weakness.This projector from TMI is 9500 lumens. While still bright enough for use in darkened areas after sunset or indoors (and I've had others with 9500 lumens that I've used numerous times in those circumstances, providing great enjoyment), it's clearly less bright than a projector with more power. I've compared the image to a projector with 15000 lumens and the difference is noticeable. HOWEVER, this projector is FAR lighter, more portable, and can stand on a tripod, whereas the 15000 lumens projector needs a table and is significantly less portable. So, it's a matter of what you need and/or prefer. I'm quite happy with a portable projector that is more easily transferred to friends' places. Image quality is overall fine (see pictures), but again, if you really want brighter images and don't mind the impact that may have on the size of the device, feel free to opt for that.FYI, there is a setting for adjusting the brightness. It came from the factory adjusted to the medium setting; I raised it to the maximum for the images I'm including here.With regards to the image quality, one issue I've had in the past with projectors is that not the entire image is in focus: if you try to focus the top, the bottom is often not very focused and blurry. This makes watching films with subtitles a problem. This projector, in my trials of it, seems to not have that issue. I played films with subtitles and I was able to read the subtitles clearly without sacrificing any (at least nothing I noticed) focus on top. This is what really makes me feel pretty comfortable giving this projector a five star review. Being able to watch foreign films or anything with subtitles expands the options. Please see the images, paying attention to the subtitles and the focus all across the screen, top to bottom and left to right. There may be some distortion towards the bottom left and right because I was projecting on to a sheet (not provided with projector) that was not tied down on the lower ends, just held from the top in my garage after sunset. That is not the projector, that is this reviewers' laziness.The other thing this projector has going for it is that it has a built in DVD player. Now, I know, it seems like an anomaly for anything to have a built in DVD player nowadays, but there ARE cases where this could be useful. I can see, for example, this being useful on an extended trip or camping, especially if with kids, in areas where maybe internet or cell phone access may be limited. This can give provide some shared viewing experiences for the family without having to hunker down around smaller screens, even outdoors (as long as there's a power supply nearby for devices). I myself do have DVDs, as does the local library, so I can definitely enjoy having less cables around as today's laptops and computers hardly ever have built in DVD players, which requires an external DVD player and the necessary cables to connect.The DVD player worked fine. Not much I can add about that. The included remote control is complex like remote controls tend to be nowadays, many buttons, small buttons: glasses may be needed to read the text on the remote control. Nonetheless, it worked fine.There are options to connect devices via USB and HDMI. While I don't have cables to connect any of my devices via USB, I was able to connect the projector to a laptop with an HDMI cable (one is provided with the projector) and that worked fine.One last thing: In my experience, this company DOES respond to customer inquiries/complaints, etc. That I think is 1) unheard of these days (it's not a bot, it's a person writing to you, I'm pretty sure) and 2) pretty darn appreciated.Again, for the money, this can be of use to those who enjoy being outside in the backyard with a bunch of friends (or kids) watching a film and generally feeling more free and less restricted. (Of course, it can also be used inside, but I have a preference for outside viewing.)So, overall, I do recommend this if you want a portable, hassle free way to watch films outdoors, especially if on DVD (though laptops can be connected), keeping in mind that it's not going to be as bright as projectors with more lumens (which are not going to be as portable, though), but which will be for sure bright enough to enjoy!",

The picture quality is of course average (plenty for 720p content) and the sound is surprisingly good. It actually has dedicated L and R channels + a tiny sub. Its also light so it can be mounted on a simple camera tripodDVD works great when camping and is more simple than trying to make a hotspot for wifi like other models. Overall satisifed with purchase.",
