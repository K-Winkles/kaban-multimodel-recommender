The picture is bright, colorful and detailed. Setup is a breeze and it has apps you can use to stream your favorite movies and shows through wi-fi. It is a great portable projector for moving around, watching movies outside and we plan to take it camping sometimes as well. Would highly recommend if you want to dip your toes into the projector world as a first projector. Speakers are pretty good as well, though you can't beat having the projector hooked up to a surround sound system.",
