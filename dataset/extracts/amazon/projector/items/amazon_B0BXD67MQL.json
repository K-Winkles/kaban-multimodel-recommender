I looked for a long time at different projectors comparing quality features and price. I ended up settling on this one. It is the perfect solution for us! The quality really is good. (I mean it's not 4k but let's be realistic in our hopes here lol) it offers multiple ways to set up the projection, behind screen, direct projection, different mounted positions as well. You can see some of the feature options in my photos including a direct cast from your phone to the device meaning no extra items to connect. Of course It does have HDMI and USB ports if you need to hook things up. The clarity of the image was decent. I am definitely satisfied with this projector. The sound that comes directly from it is also acceptable. It is pretty loud on it's own which if I use it with my camp equipment that's great because I don't have to connect speakers but at home it connects via Bluetooth right to my sound bar. In all the price in combination with all the features and the fact that it was basically barely more than plug and play, this projector was the best combination of value!",

This one runs on minimal power, no smells or hot air. I'm sure it must be not as bright but the difference was slight. It was a no brainer the $300 one went back to the store. My thanks to those who wrote a review on this one that gave me hope it could be what is at this price. Impressive.",
