                "reviewText": "It is very difficult to hide my disappointment in this purchase. I knew the projector was cheap, and I'm well aware of the adage, \"You get what you pay for!\", but this, if it were not so unbelievably sad would be truly laughable.First thing I noticed was that the \"User Guide\", (It equals about 1/3 of a sheet of standard paper), was in a terrible state by being torn and becoming loose at the folds. This contributed to my ever growing suspicion that this unit was a \"return\" which SHOULD have been but had NOT been \"refurbished\".The \"Upside Down and Backwards\" comment is not a joke. (See picture) In addition, I'm not really sure what language in which it is written and I have yet to discover how to select a language.The buttons on the remote only work \"intermittently\".The unIt does register as reading a USB stick, but so far I have found no way to access it. All efforts to select the buttons on the projector or the remote fail to provide any action beyond moving the highlight on the projection. Of course, part of this may be because I'm trying to navigate the display upside down and backwards...The projected image displays correctly only if the projector is placed upside down. The projection does present in the correct orientation when projected onto a screen as a rear screen projection and if the projector is upside down. So, if I were capable of standing on my head and somehow looking out of my backside this unit would work for me just fine!The unit runs HOT. VERY hot! Ironically, it makes a SIZZLING noise as if some circuit inside is beginning to fry after only a few minutes of attempting to operate the unit. So maybe there is a valid reason for the unit running hot.If anyone is considering this unit, I'd highly recommend investigating other units.",
