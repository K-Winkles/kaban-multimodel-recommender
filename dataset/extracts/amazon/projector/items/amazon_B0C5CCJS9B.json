                "reviewText": "We love it! This is a first class projector screen with a size of 100 inches. My family is big into movie nights, and someone brought up doing a projection movie, so I found this. The quality is unmatched with a double side projection screen. In the box you will also find 6 hooks for simple assembly to use. This is made to be used either indoor or outside. What I found amazing about the design of this is the fact it has a 160 wide viewing angle. This allows our family or friends to sit comfortably without being too close to others, and truly relax. We watched Avatar 2 on this, and boy what a fun time we had. Another factor in selecting this projection screen was \"storage\" - I really despise clutter in my house, so this was perfect as it can be folded and stowed away until ready to be used. With that, it is portable and so you can travel or bring it over to a fiends place for a movie night- boxing night- superbowl. SO many ways to use this projection screen. It is a great investment in my humble opinion.Specs on thi projection are as follows:Hooks and rope are included - HOWEVER, the nails are NOTOverall, I am quite pleased about this 4k projection screen - the visual is very good, not blurry or distorted. The thickness is 2.5\" thicker than other competitors- it is decent and had no issues with the background being impacted by the actual thickness. Therefore, based on my usage and experience with this projection screen, I would suggest to others to look at this one as it meets and exceeds most of all my expectations. The price point does seem fair and accurate.",
