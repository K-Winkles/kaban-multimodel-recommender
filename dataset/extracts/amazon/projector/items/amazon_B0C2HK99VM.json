                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very easy to set up with decent picture quality",
                "reviewText": "One of the simpler HDMI projectors I have had the pleasure of using. The image quality is solid, and the device itself is very simple to use. It has a tripod screw mount on the bottom, so you have the option of either setting it up there or on a table. If setting up on a table is your preference, remember to use the angle screw as you need that to tilt the projector upwards. The device supports multiple refresh rates, from 60Hz all the way down to 24Hz, so you can really dial it in to whatever rate you need depending on the type of movie that is being played. The rear of the device had two HDMI ports, 2 USB, a RCA adapter port, and a 3.5mm audio out. The HDMI can be used for bypassing the onboard software to use the device just as you would an external display. The USBs are for playing local media files off of a flash drive. This can be done with the projectors built in video player. I found it easier to connect a laptop and play stuff off of it, but it is nice that the device doesn't require a computer to do so. I also appreciate the AV connector, this made it easy for me to connect some of my older consoles, such as my Wii without having to use a HDMI to RCA adapter.The picture quality is about as you would expect for a compact portable device. It gets bright enough to use in a dim room, but loses some vibrancy if used in the daytime. For its size, it gets plenty bright and looks good at a variety of focal lengths. The focusing is done with a ring at the top. It is very simple to dial in and can be done fairly quickly. The power supply is built in, which helps keep the size of the device down, you only need to connect a standard AC cable on the outside. The included remote works as you would expect, there are IR receivers on both sides so it can pick up input from anywhere in a room. Using the remote isn\u2019t necessary as there are controls on the top of the device as well that can be used to access the device settings. Also there is a built in speaker that can be used to output the audio from the source, but it can\u2019t do stereo separation that well as it is only a single unit. It works well enough if you are playing an older game or just using it as a display. But if you want to watch a movie I would suggest connecting a different audio output.Overall it is a well rounded projector that has the modern input of 1080p HDMI, as well as being compact enough to easily pack in a bag. I would have liked to see a lens cover, but the packaging does include a bubble wrap cover to help transport it, so it\u2019s not too much of a problem. It feels like a pretty decent value as the device has a good feature set and includes a good set of accessories. I can't really find any faults with this one.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a pretty good projector for $30. Compared to others in the price range, it supports 1080p and not just 720p resolution AND you can use wifi with this. I use this while teaching and I can\u2019t get the classroom to be super dark - the blinds are not all able to close fully on the windows - BUT we get a decent picture and the students were able to watch videos fine.The unit itself is small. I can stand it on my tripod without if falling down - even though it\u2019s much bigger than the base that I sit it on. You can also use it with Chromecast or roku etc.The cons are that the sound is low and the speakers are at the bottom of the projector. If you sit it on top of a table or something, the sound will be muffled. The picture when casting via wifi from your phone or tablet is smaller and is by default 720p as the native resolution - this is normal and happens on more expensive projectors from what I\u2019ve seen. Also - as stated in the listing - when using direct wifi, you cannot cast from prime video, Netflix etc. because it doesn\u2019t have adequate technology to protect what you\u2019re steaming. (Well you can, you\u2019ll only hear sound and no video). These things are to be expected for the cheaper price. Just use it with your roku stick or Chrome cast and it\u2019ll fix this issue. Use your own speakers - even from your laptop - and it\u2019ll fix the sound issue. For this cheap price, I don\u2019t mind the issues above - as I said they are easily fixable. All the instructions for setting up wifi are on the projector.All in all I like this projector. I wasn\u2019t sure how it would fair while teaching but I had no problems. The picture is pretty clear/adjustable and the color can be adjusted to one of the presets or you can set it yourself. I have not used the remote yet but there is an easy navigation on the top of the unit to navigate the different setting options.I highly recommend especially if this little one is on sale.",

Its a little finicky to angle and focus it but if you have a table or projector stand it should be easier to do. There's no sound but there's a headphone port and a Bluetooth connection option so that should be good and you can hook a speaker to the device your using to make the sound louder. (I blacked out my x-box acount so yall wouldn't know my gamer tag)",

Even during the day, he's able to watch anything though it gets a little washed out. I bought a screen for him so now it's extra clear. Before, he projected on an off-white wall. He doesn't use the speakers on the projector but the sound was clear when tested.I recommend this \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",

The built-in speaker is, as expected, quiet and low-quality. Still, truthfully, you don't buy a projector for the speakers you buy to see a clear picture and easy to connect to your systems or whatever presentation you are doing. This is that component. Great and easy to connect.",
