                "reviewText": "Amazing for my little dorm room. I got this 42 percent off and it was totally worth it. I would totally recommend for ppl with small rooms :) . The quality of the project is quite impressive for the price. And the sound is also pretty good in my small room. I wouldn\u2019t depend on it for a giant room but it\u2019s definitely great for the price and super easy for me since I have an hdmi port already in my computer. One thing to know if you want to use iPhone, you\u2019ll need to buy the proper adaptors but it recommends in the pamphlet what to buy! Overall I\u2019m super satisfied",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. READ THIS ASAP!! If you are deciding should you buy. Works with mirroring your Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox I don't know where to begin. I initially ordered only 1 for xmas( for a son that has all types of gadgets and this was something he did not own) but after playing around with it to make sure it worked, I had to get one for all of my 3boys and myself. Yes I bought 4 Projectors. They were on sale for xmas for about $55.00. Grab while it has 30% off. Great deal for this!! Yess Im truly pleased and excited about it. I haven't written a review on anything in awhile, years, but this was something I had to tell everyone about. I base a lot of my buying on reviews and YOU MUST BUY THIS. Ladies your man will love watching the game supersized on the wall. And the volume is loud. In the video my son is watching the game from his xbox. ESPN. It is much clearer than you see. He was laying down and I wanted to quickly record it.. He uses it for facebook, scrolling the web, watching movies, everything. ohhh, for xmas, I surprised everyone and had it on the wall, just the wall, no projector screen. We watched videos from last xmas as we opened gifts. It was the talk of Christmas. Since me and my family have used it on everything ( Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox ) I wanted to share this important information for anyone looking to purchase. I hope this helps: With the Iphone you need to use hdmi adapter [Apple MFi Certified] Lightning to HDMI Adapter, for iPhone 1080P HDMI Digital AV Adapter Sync Screen Connector with Charging ( and yes I bought the $13.99 from amazon, works perfect. The real adapters are about $44.00 and I was not buying 4 of those. It has a remote. Android phones need a different adapter. Im going to do another review with my other son cause he has called me bragging about this since Christmas . I will update u with a future review if there are any issues that cant be resolved. Nooo Im not getting paid for this. Just excited to see the entire family fall in love with this.March 2, 2021Title: I am back with three amazing reviews, Not from me but each person I gave these projectors to as gifts.I have bought a total of 8 Auking Projectors. I asked everyone to write a review and send to me since it was ordered under my amazon account. . Here are the copied reviews.My name is Tonya. I received this item as a Wedding Gift from my sister. I am happy to be doing a review on this. My sister had ordered 4 of these projectors for her family for Christmas. She called me showing me how it worked and I got so excited and wanted one. I got married in Jan and she surprised me and my husband with one and I was jumping and screaming because this projector is awesome. The video clarity is great, You can see it clearly in the day, but it is much better when the room is darker. My husband watched the live game on ESPN and he really enjoyed it with his brother. I hope they dont take it over now, lol. The picture size is really big, not sure of exact size. A video is attached. I love the fact that I view everything on my Android phone on the screen, while laying in bed. Below is her review she added in December.My name is Theresa. I received this item as a Gift from Starr and I doing this review under her account. I never thought about getting a projector before I received it. When I received this item from Starr, she also sent me the link on Amazon so I would know all of the devices that it could be viewed with. My son (14yrs. old) actually plugged it up and showed me how it it works. It was really easy, nothing to read. You plug in two cords and attach to whatever device that you are using. My sons wanted to watch view things from his Iphone on the wall. I ordered an HDMI Connector cable from Amazon and it was also easy to attach. We have it in the living room because my teens enjoy getting on social media and playing games on the wall. We dont have a projector screen and we will get one soon. It shows up great on the wall. I will end up getting another projector for them because I dont want them using it so much. Everyone loves it is all I can say. Thank you for this great gift Starr, You are the best.My name is Ana and I received this a Housewarming Gift from Starr. Me and my husband lovesss this Aurking Projector. We had been looking for a projector for a long time but we couldn't decide, which one to get. Thankfully we have received this as a gift. We have already had a movie night with family and everyone was talking about how they wanted one. The picture quality is good. It does show clearer at night but the quality is not bad during the daytime. I will be purchasing one for my daughter because she has been sneaking it to her room, lol.",

                "reviewText": "I've never owned a projector but I wanted something to watch in the bedroom thats not a TV and I would have to hang on the wall. I don't have enough wall space. This projector is perfect to watch in the ceiling and the sound is loud. Easy to set up. I connected my Chromecast Google dongle and use my Google remote for volume. Works great.Note:The room does have to be dark to have clear picture. There's a manual knob on the projector for adjusting the picture for clarity.The projector remote doesnt come with batteries.In order to select HDMI on the home screen, you have to use projector remote to do so or press the buttons that are located on the projector itself. Which can be a pain if you already positioned your projector somewhere hard to reach.Dust do collect inside the lens. Regular cleaning will need to done.Other than that, its a simple piece of equipment for transport, set up, and serves my purpose.Connect some awesome speakers and you'll have a theater experience on your home ceiling.",

It was also easy to carry around the conference until my presentation (the box was small, secure, and had a handle). It has a clear image that shows color well. I am glad I bought this and look forward to having it for future conferences/ presentations.I used it on my laptop and the remote doesn't connect to changing slides so if you use it for a presentation, you still need someone or something to click through slides.",
