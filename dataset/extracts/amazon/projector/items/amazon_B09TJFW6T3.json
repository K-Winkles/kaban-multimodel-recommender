                "reviewText": "I don't write many reviews but I just realized I've had this one for a year and it's still performing great. I got this as a cheap projector for family movie nights in the backyard and had low expectations. This works perfectly for our needs & we're happy with it. I used to work as a projectionist, both with 35mm film and the latest digital projectors, this is nowhere near what you'd get at a cinema, but it also costs a fraction of what even a cinema projector's light bulb costs (not to mention the electricity needed to run a cinema projector) and for the price and size, this is pretty good. We don't use the screen it came with anymore; it looks great just on a white wall. The speaker is fine, but pretty weak, and it's easy to run a line to a better sound system (note: if it's bluetooth there's going to be a bit of lag).We've watched many movies on this with no issues at all and it's still going strong. I have a fancier name-brand projector we use for presentations at the office and, when that one dies, I'll probably just replace it with one of these. Highly recommended. Also, the reviews that mention it not working in the daylight are accurate. That'll be the case with any projector. Even the ones I've worked with that have a laser light engine and a six-figure price tag.",

The projector itself is very small, light weight and even comes with a projector screen that is easy to setup. I didn't use the screen but I did really appreciated it. I actually projected movies against a blank white wall via my laptop and Firestick (as seen in my video). I have not tried to mirror anything yet, but from the reviews I've read it seems like there's no issues or problems with mirroring devices.It supports both wired and wireless connections, and it is also bluetooth compatible. I connected my Bluetooth speaker system to give it that movie theater sound effect and I love it! The sound quality is good and so is the video!It supports HDMI, USB, SD card, and more.Again, picture quality is really good! I bought this projector for my vacation home and I did not want to buy a TV because wanted to save space and money. I am very happy with my purchase and I honestly believe for the value and price combined, you can't beat it! I am very happy with my purchase. If you're looking for an inexpensive project to suit your basic needs, look no further.",
