                "reviewText": "This little projector has a great picture. The scaling feature will let you get a 16 x 9 picture down to 3' wide at 50% about 4' from your screen or wall. The picture is bright and readable, the Wi-fi feature is very neat, audio lag is minimal and the whole thing will fit in your hand. They issue is there is no keystone correction, the box says auto-keystone correction but after contacting the Mfg I was told they did not offer that feature on this model because it is so small. The auto focus feature was not useful, I used the manual focus and was able to get a clear picture. If you could place the projector at a height that is at the center of your screen you could get by without Keystone correction but that means it has to be in the viewing area and you would need a fairly tall stand. I really wanted to love this little projector, if it had keystone correction is would be awesome but without it, use is very limited.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For an affordable, portable projector I am quite pleased with the HIPPUS. I've been running it off of HDMI, connected to a secondary computer and, on the whole, the experience has been great. However, In my brief attempts at testing, was unsuccessful at screen-mirroring an Amazon Fire tablet. The tablet recognized the projector, but failed to connect.My main criticism with the unit is that it runs a little hot and loud, so it's not something you want to be sitting directly beside. With headphones on, it wasn't too obnoxious, but without it can be a little distracting.The projector is fairly compact and lightweight, though likely not best-in-class in either regard. Build quality is nice, and has all the basic features you will need to get projecting. That said, I'm not a huge fan of the focus adjuster. I can't help but feel you would get a lot better fine-tune adjustment from a traditional ring, rather than the lever which is entirely too easy to bump out of focus while messing with the device.Picture quality in a dark room was good, given I was looking at simulated 1080p on 720p native resolution (though it did take a bit of fiddling with the picture settings, as none of the default options looked particularly good to me.) As you can see in with my pictures, though... excess light in the room can dull it out pretty quickly.For you gamers out there, input lag was surprisingly minimal, so unless you are trying to play a super twitchy, hyper-competitive shooter, I think you'll be just as pleased with this for gaming as you will be for movie watching.",

It's basically an Android smart display, similar to Android TV, but allows you to connect virtually anything. The picture quality is great for 1080p and the refresh rate is acceptable, even good. It won't replace a large stationary projector, but for something to use on the go at a meeting, presentation, or an outdoor event at night in your backyard? Yeah, not bad.It's about the size of a really thick book and weighs about a pound, so easy to carry for sure. The small size means it gets hot and the fan goes full blast when you're using it. There's no away around that, unfortunately, with this kind of technology. It's a projector, projectors get hot. The brightness is also subpar, not bad, but daylight viewing is going to be poor. Still, even with its downsides, it's a pretty good projector and costs quite a bit less than comparable options.",
