                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the third projector I've owned and the second one I've bought from Yaber. I am absolutely floored by how nice this is compared to the cost. My first big surprise was when I turned it on it went into a quick auto-focus mode and magically focused itself perfectly. The rest of the setup process was equally simple. The coolest thing about this projector is the ability to adjust the picture to any room. I was able to put the projector at the back of the room on a desk and then adjust the picture so it was the perfect size and in the perfect position on my screen. My old projectors would require me to move the projector around and lift it up to get the picture in position. This one let me make all the adjustments digitally quickly and easily. This one is also roughly 2x as bright as my previous projector. I was able to use it during the day time with some light coming through the windows. The picure quality is very crisp and the contrast is nice. The colors are vivid and accurate to my source laptop. The built-in speaker is a big improvement over my previous model, it's still not a high powered booming speaker, but it will be perfect for outdoor movie night and office presentations and stuff. It sounds clear and has a nice bass / treble mix. The screen cast feature and wifi worked well, but I still prefer to use my laptop via HDMI. I think this feature would be good for presentations though. I tried a few different screen mode presets and found the gaming mode to look the best, but I was still able to make it slightly better by making my own adjustments. I have no realy complaints about this projector. I'm blown away at how affordable and quality it is. I bought an Optoma projector in 2017 for $2k and this one is so much better, and only a fraction of the cost.",

I was skeptical at first, but it definitely was worth the purchase!I still have an older Yaber projector for few years now and decided it was time to upgrade.My previous Yaber projector was not that bright and only 720p, so it was decent quality for the price back then. I figured I would give this one a try and I was not disappointed.The K2s is similar in size but with everything better, decent speakers, low fan noise (you can barely ear it), plenty bright for watching in a semi lit room. I even tried it with the full room lights on and it still held pretty good (obviously it\u2019s best in the dark).New functionality (for me), the capability to use different app like Neflix/Prime/Disney\u2026 and even Broadcast from your phone everything you want to see directly on the videoprojector.It is really 1080p (FULL HD) quality with great warm colors.Another big plus is the simplicity to startup and configured it, everything is now automatically adjusted, the auto-focus and auto-Keystone are awesome functionality.Overall, this thing is amazing.No regrets on this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not one to leave reviews. But this item is worth doing it for.Seriously this projector has been such a perfect addition to our outdoor family experiences. I\u2019ve had this projector for over a month now, so can\u2019t speak to longevity, yet. But so far the main parts are phenomenal.The lumens are bright. But not quite bright enough to do outdoor daylight movie viewing. We did have to update our screen to front view only to try and accommodate that. We live in a very bright sunny part of Oregon and in the summer the sun does not set until 8pm. So movies don\u2019t begin until 8:30pm here. We got it to work slightly during dusk once we purchased a better thicker screen. But not as bright as my friends projector that projects over 3,000 Lumens (professional level projector).But once night falls, the image quality is outstanding. The connectivity for the Internet and Bluetooth is a fast is my apple cell phone. Which makes streaming and viewing seamless. I have project it up to 150 inches. Haven\u2019t tested out the 200 inch Max yet. But based off of everything I have witnessed so far I have full faith that this projector will be able to project up too 200 inches without any issues. The keystone can be a little finicky, depending on what screen material you were using, but as long as you know how to do it manually it\u2019s easy to operate. The zoom quality is nice. And the auto focus is wonderful. When watching a movie outdoors, I tend to turn off auto zoom and the auto Keystone, in case the winds ripples the screen causing by the projector to try and auto correct the issue.I have used it both as a front and rear screen importarte and it handled both ways beautifully.Sound quality is great for indoor operation. When doing outdoor we connected via Bluetooth to our outdoor speakers and it had zero issues or glitches.This projector was worth every penny and so far I am very happy with my purchase.My ONLY con is it does not come with a case and so far I have not found a storage/carrying case in my budget that fits this projector. I will continue hunting for one.",

The picture quality is outstanding, with vibrant colors and sharp clarity that brings my favorite movies and shows to life. Its 4K resolution and HDR support make every viewing experience a joy.Setting up the K2s was a breeze, thanks to its user-friendly interface and comprehensive connectivity options. Whether it's streaming content from my favorite apps or connecting to other devices, this projector handles it all seamlessly.I'm also impressed by the built-in speaker's audio quality, which is surprisingly good for a projector of this size. Of course, for a more immersive sound experience, I connect it to my external speakers, and the options for customization are fantastic.One of the standout features is the auto keystone correction and focus adjustment, which saves me time and ensures a perfectly aligned and sharp image every time I use it.The build quality is robust, and the remote control is intuitive and well-designed. Overall, the Yaber K2s is a fantastic addition to my home entertainment setup, offering incredible performance, ease of use, and value for money. I couldn't be happier with my purchase!",

Build quality is fantastic, and having proper keystone and auto focus correction out of the box was definitely a plus.The image is crisp and clean and bright.The android tv built in is good and responsive and functions well, just like a Firestick. Most apps are available, though there is an issue with ITVX where it won\u2019t play with Android tv. (My father in law bought the same projector the day after I did and has the same trouble.)I have attached a video showing it on my wall with my curtains drawn. It is more impressive at night and I really cannot overstate how good this unit is.The operating system menus are clear and well thought out, and putting actual Amazon Firestick in this and running it through the HDMI gave clear and detailed images.The sound has to be heard to be believed, the. Dolby Atmos sound is excellent, and the bass rumble and clarity are all you will need in a small to medium sized room. I have an AVR 7.1.4 Denon X3800H system running in my main room so understand a bit about quality sound.I was also able to attach my external ROG SSD drive caddy through the USB port and it had no trouble seeing the drive and navigating through the file systems to display images and videos.All in all if you had to go for a projector within this price range (or higher) for a 1080p native with 4K support projector you won\u2019t go wrong.",

Premi\u00e8rement, je dirais que je suis vraiment impressionn\u00e9 par la qualit\u00e9 de l'image fourni par ce projecteur, l'image est nette, les r\u00e9glages sont simples \u00e0 prendre en main. L'autofocus automatique est tr\u00e8s pratique. D'autre part le dongle fournis permettant de transformer le projecteur en Android TV est vraiment tr\u00e8s pratique et agr\u00e9able \u00e0 utiliser. Le son compatible dolby atmos est excellent et permet d'utiliser le produit sans avoir besoin d'acheter de home cin\u00e9ma m\u00eame si je les recommande tout de m\u00eame pour un r\u00e9sultat plus immersif il n'est absolument pas indispensable.Le projecteur donne une impression de qualit\u00e9 des la prise en main, les mat\u00e9riaux utilis\u00e9s sont de bonne facture. En revanche celui-ci est un peu bruyant, mais le son cache sans aucun probl\u00e8me le bruit de fonctionnement de l'appareil on n'est donc pas g\u00ean\u00e9s par celui-ci quand on regarde un film.Le seul point n\u00e9gatif est qu'il n'est pas possible de l'utiliser avec une source de lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 (voir photo).Je n'ai pas encore test\u00e9 le produit en mode gaming, mais je n'ai pas de doute quant \u00e0 son efficacit\u00e9 au vu des performances jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 :point positif- rapport qualit\u00e9 prix- images bluffantes - compatibilit\u00e9 Dolby Atmos- Android TV- son de tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9- prise en main rapide pour les non-initi\u00e9s- Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de l'accrocher au plafond pour l'utiliserpoint n\u00e9gatif :- luminosit\u00e9 trop faible pr\u00e8s d'une source de lumi\u00e8re- l\u00e9g\u00e8rement bruyant- Une housse de rangement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9ciable.En somme, c'est un projecteur qui jouit d'un excellent rapport qualit\u00e9 prix \u00e0 mes yeux, et qui saura satisfaire la majorit\u00e9 des usages. Je ne doute pas qu'un \u00e9cran de projection augmentera encore d'avantage ses performances. Je pense avoir fait le tour de mon avis sur ce produit, j'esp\u00e8re vous avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 utile et vous souhaite de bonne s\u00e9ance de cin\u00e9 dans votre salon",
