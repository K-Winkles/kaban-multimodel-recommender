                "reviewText": "I wanted something that was bright enough to show movies outside before it was completely dark. This does that. It also has lighted buttons (very helpful) and can be mounted on a tripod. The built-in speakers are surprisingly load and clear for our needs. If more volume is needed , external speakers such as a soundbar can be connected to the headphone jack The carrying case keeps the projector protected and the cables from getting lost. Menus are clear and easy to navigate. It connected to my WiFi without issues. Only negative was choppy audio when streaming from my android phone. I'm not worried about that, because I plan on using a DVD player anyway. I would love it if I could connect a soundbar via bluetooth. Bottom line. It does what I bought it for, and does it well. Good value for the money.",

The ease of setting this one up was very impressive. It found and connected to my home wifi immediately. The clarity of the picture is also impressive. That image in my video is from 11ish in the am. So it was kind of bright and you could see it clear as day. The carrying case is also nice. Very clear instructions as well.",
