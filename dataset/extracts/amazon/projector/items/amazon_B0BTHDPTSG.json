                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great features for great price.",
                "reviewText": "I was looking for an inexpensive but feature rich project to use occasionally for movie nights in the bedroom. This projector absolutely fits that bill. I got it during prime day, however, I noticed that this company often has deals on their projectors.First of all, and most importantly, the picture quality is excellent. I just project onto my bedroom wall and it looks great. I\u2019ve watched a few different things, from comedies to action, movies, and it all looks great. I\u2019ve only used HDMI extensively, but I have also connected my iPhone to the projector wirelessly, and it worked well. Truly good high definition viewing. The colors are great, the images are sharp, and everything is smooth.The auto focus and Keystone feature is fantastic and works great. When you turn the project on it automatically does this for you and if it\u2019s just a little off, there is a button on your remote with a plus and negative sign to dial it in just a little more. I\u2019ve only done that maybe once, and it was such a minor change that it really didn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve never had to worry about fixing the Keystone, though, he gets that perfect every time. Obviously, the built in speakers on as good as an external Soundsystem, but they work really well. I\u2019ve connected my JBL Bluetooth speaker and it works really well and sounds really great with that. I would recommend you use an external speaker, especially if you\u2019re watching something that really depends on loud volume, but if it\u2019s just for casual, watching in your bedroom, the internal speakers are fine.The one thing I think people might be upset about is that you can\u2019t watch Netflix on it if you connect directly from your phone. It\u2019s a licensing issue. You can obviously connect your laptop with Netflix or Firestick, but you can\u2019t use your phone and wirelessly connect to watch Netflix. This was mentioned by the projectors maker, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me, but just keep in mind that you will have to use a computer or a Firestick if you want to watch Netflix.At the back, there are two USB inputs, to HDMI inputs, a socket for the AV adapter and an audio jack. The power cord plugs in at the side. On top, there are eight buttons, so if you lost the remote, you wouldn\u2019t be completely ruined. It has the power on button, the four directional buttons, a button to take you back to the home, projector page, a back button, and an OK button. At the bottom of the projector there are four rubberized feet and a height. Adjustable twist stand to aim the project, a higher if needed.In the box, there is a really nice carry backpack, the power cord, a remote, AV cables, a HDMI, cable, a lens cover, a cleaning kit, and, of course a nice thick user manual. Everything was packaged really well and obviously it has everything you need right out of the box.Personally, I don\u2019t think it runs too loud at all, it\u2019s just got a small fan that deals with heat. Obviously, it\u2019s not silent by any means, but it also isn\u2019t too loud. The built-in speakers allowed enough to drown out the fan easily.Overall, it\u2019s a great unit. Especially if you can get it under $200 like I did, it\u2019s a really good deal. The picture quality plus the auto focus alone make this worth the price. Obviously, I can\u2019t speak to the longevity of the projector, as I\u2019ve only had it about a week, but it is well made from what I can tell, and just like anything, if you look after it, it\u2019ll probably last longer than if you don\u2019t. Great product.",

I like that it was pretty easy to set up and also easy to operate, it has a remote and you can connect through bluetooth which is very convenient. We have been using it for a few hours now with a 100 inch screen. The imagine quality, coloration and brightness is perfect. It's nice that you have an option to mount the projector or rest it on a coffee table.There's a 3 years warranty programm you can sign in for, don't miss this opportunity!

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I'm not by any means a frequent projector user, so this is one of 2 home projectors I've spent some time with. I've tested out a ton of apps and video types and inputs and I can say this passes the test for pretty much any typical user. Initially the device takes less than 20 seconds to boot up before it directs you to a simple and clean home page. From here I was able to change any picture or sound settings, select the input, connect wifi, Bluetooth, etc.The remote itself feels sturdy and the buttons have a nice click feel to them. A few times it didn't register a button press, but I presume this is because I'm normally a fast button clicker. The sound was only at 50% volume to start and I could tell it was loud and has some substance to it. I was impressed when I started playing some videos, I almost felt I could manage without an extra Bluetooth speaker for most occasions. Compared to my other projector, this unit has a more simple and user friendly interface, I didn't find it difficult at all to adjust picture settings or make manual adjustments. I'm sure if I had a child they could figure it out just as fastAfter exploring the settings, I messed around with the auto keystone and auto focus a bit. They're both fantastic features to have, however the auto keystone was giving me a little trouble since I was projecting on a 120\" screen in a room that should've been a little bigger. I kept the auto focus on and any time I accidentally touched the projector, it would do its thing and auto focus, pretty much as clear as I could get it. Obviously the manual fine tuning is still an option if you really wanted the control. I ended up turning off/resetting the trapezoid correction since it kept making the right side of the screen shorter than the left, and this resolved my issue, but I'll keep attempting in other environments.As I did with my previous projector, I connected a Roku 4K stick to the HDMI and plugged the USB into the USB slot on the projector rather than trying to find a second wall outlet to occupy. Still worked great for me and opened up more options for content rather than trying to mirror from my phone or attaching a laptop every time.All in all, the quality of the image and sound are fantastic, the build quality has nothing to complain about, and the software overall is just what I need. Playing YouTube videos allowed me to project a definition up to 1080p 60fps and this was excellent enough, especially with a totally dark room. Image quality can be subjective and can also depend on the input method, so from my point of view it was excellent for an affordable projector. Other than the auto keystone needing some extra practice in other rooms or screens, I've found the lens cap was a little tough to get back on when the auto focus moves the lens out further than the initial opening of the projector out of the box. This isn't a huge deal, there's a layer of styrofoam that protects the plastic cap and the glass lens, so I'm not totally uncomfortable if it's a little tight. I just ended up manually focusing the image to a point where the lens retracts far enough to fully place the lens cap back on. Again, not a huge inconvenience but something to watch for.Nothing is totally perfect but I would definitely recommend and purchase this again if I needed to, and I'll update keep updating if I find any changes",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe mich bewusst f\u00fcr den Beamer \u201eWimius K1, 1080p \u201c entschieden, da er sowohl in seiner Funktionalit\u00e4t als auch im Preis meinen Vorstellungen entspricht. Ich ben\u00f6tige den Beamer lediglich im privaten Umfeld f\u00fcr Vortr\u00e4ge, Reiseberichte oder Pr\u00e4sentationen zu Geburtstagen etc.. Daf\u00fcr ist dieser Beamer ausgezeichnet geeignet. Das Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis erscheint mir auch, nachdem ich ihn ausprobiert habe, weiterhin sehr gut. Die Projektionsfl\u00e4che kann in der Diagonalen Werte zwischen ca. 50 und 300 inches annehmen bei einem Abstand zwischen ca. 1,50 bis zu 7 m. Das Handbuch enth\u00e4lt eine Tabelle mit 7 Abstandswerten und den dazugeh\u00f6rigen Diagonall\u00e4ngen. Ich habe unterschiedliche Abst\u00e4nde zwischen 1,50 m und 5 m ausprobiert und jedesmal gestochen scharfe Bilder einstellen k\u00f6nnen.Der Beamer ist mit seinem Zubeh\u00f6r (3 Kabel: Strom, HDMI und AV) sehr handlich in einer Tragetasche untergebracht. Er hat 2 USB - und 2 HDMI Anschl\u00fcsse sowie eine Kopfh\u00f6rerbuchse und einem AV-Ausgang.Der Beamer ist schnell einsatzbereit, die Handhabung ist \u00fcberwiegend selbsterkl\u00e4rend. Inhalte von mobilen Endger\u00e4ten, die \u00fcber USB mit dem Beamer verbunden werden, sind sofort sichtbar. WLAN und Bluetooth m\u00fcssen aktiviert werden, alles geht schnell und unproblematisch. F\u00fcr den Normalgebrauch reicht der interne Lautsprecher, dessen Lautst\u00e4rke bequem \u00fcber die Fernbedienung eingestellt wird. \u00dcbrigens geh\u00f6ren die Batterien (2 AAA) nicht zum Lieferumfang, man sollte sie also bereit halten. \u00dcber Bluetooth kann ein externer Lautsprecher oder ein Soundbar angeschlossen werden.Bei Bildern kann man unterschiedliche Filter w\u00e4hlen, um die Farbgebung der Originalfotos besser zu treffen.Smartphones (Android oder iPhone) werden nicht \u00fcber Bluetooth mit dem Beamer verbunden sondern \u00fcbers WLAN, es muss also sowohl beim Beamer als auch beim Smartphone dasselbe WLAN aktiviert werden.Die manuelle Keystone Korrektur kann bis zu \u00b150\u00b0 eine trapezf\u00f6rmigen Projektionsfl\u00e4che in eine rechteckige transformieren.Deckenmontage ist m\u00f6glich, die zugeh\u00f6rige Aufh\u00e4ngung muss getrennt bestellt werden.Auch wenn die Bedienungsanleitung darauf hinweist, den Beamer im abgedunkelten Raum zu benutzen, ist er durchaus bei Tageslicht verwendbar.Die Bedienungsanleitung erzeugt auf Grund der maschinellen \u00dcbersetzung aus dem Englischen immer wieder Heiterkeit. Hier zwei Beispiele:\u201eVerwenden Sie diesen Beamer beim Zeichnen des Vorhangs\u201cdie Fortsetzung des Satzes \u201eoder in einem dunklen Raum\u201c gibt Aufschluss: \u201eto draw the curtains\u201c bedeutet \u201edie Vorh\u00e4nge zuziehen\u201c, \u201eto draw a picture\u201c dagegen \u201eein Bild zeichnen\u201c.Im Abschnitt \u201eVerbindung mit Smartphones und iPad\u201c hei\u00dft es \u201eStellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr Mobilger\u00e4t f\u00fcr den Beamer geschlossen ist\u201c, erst ein Blick in den Englischen Text bringt die Erleuchtung. Dort steht: \u201eis closed\u201c statt \u201eis close\u201c, die \u00dcbersetzung \u201eist geschlossen\u201c ist somit korrekt, gemeint ist aber \u201ebefindet sich in der N\u00e4he\u201cDer einzige Kritikpunkt: Die L\u00fcftung erscheint mir recht laut, aber da habe ich keinen Vergleich.Zusammenfassend: Der WiMiUS 1080p-Projektor ist eine gute Wahl f\u00fcr alle, die einen preisg\u00fcnstigen Projektor mit guter Bildqualit\u00e4t und Funktionalit\u00e4t suchen. Er verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber 2x HDMI, 2x USB-A und 1x 3,5 mm Aux-Anschluss.Ich kann den Kauf nur empfehlen und gebe dem Beamer 5 Sterne.",

Ich habe mir diesen Projektor gekauft um f\u00fcr meine Kinder Bilder und Videos an die Wand projizieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Meine Kinder sind total begeistert die Bildqualit\u00e4t ist absolut in Ordnung und die Helligkeit ist auch gut.Der Projektor kommt in einer praktischen Tasche in der das Ger\u00e4t und die Kabel gut verstaut werden k\u00f6nnen.Bedienung sowie die Verbindung mit dem Handy war kein Problem und funktioniert gut.",
