                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This One is a Keeper. Greatest Bang for the Buck.",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. \u2022 OVERVIEW: It's a KeeperWhen you watch reviews of the Nebula Mars 3 online, the people giving you their opinions uniformly praise this projector. Usually, this is a red flag for me. But, I am pleasantly surprised at how well it performs and lives up to the praise. The hardware and the build quality are solid. This is the mobile projector Apple might have designed and built if projectors were part of their product line-up. Physically handling the projector and accessories, the engineering, and attention to fit and finish are substantial. I initially gravitated to the Cosmos Laser 4K. However, the Cosmos Laser lacks an internal battery and the AI Environment adaption features. Also, the Mars 3 was almost 1/2 the cost of the Cosmos with a better feature set, IMHO. After living with this projector for the better part of a week, putting it through its paces, and digging through all its menus \u2014 I suffer no buyer's remorse. This one is a keeper. The one sticking point for me, though not a deal killer, is that Netflix is not native to the Mars 3. You can sideload it as an APK (the projector comes with easy instructions and a single-button install). Or you can use your favorite streaming stick.)\u2022 SET-UP: Easy but a Little FinickyThe set-up was easy, but I spent the better part of an evening getting things set up \"just right\" because I'm a little obsessive-compulsive. So, if you're OCD like me, you'll want to skim the Quick Start Guide and familiarize yourself with the image correction and focus controls. The AI does a great job, but sometimes, you need the human touch on focus. Last, Mars 3 will automatically ask permission to update the Firmware and the Software ASAP after you connect to WiFi. (This is a good thing as it lets you know the manufacturer is paying attention to updates.)\u2022 THE GOOD STUFF: Image + Sound QualityThe projected image is rich and vibrant, even at 150in - 200in size. It won't replace your regular TV for daytime use, but both in-house and outside, the Mars 3 really shines at night (see my projection comparison images). Color, contrast, and brightness really pop in the dark. Live football games, action movies, and even more reflective and slow scenes of nature show off how gorgeous the picture quality is. As for sound, as long as your sound levels are 25% or above, the 40W speaker fills the room. The Dolby Audio is crisp, clear, full, and rich. People who love concert movies and extra bass can always pair Bluetooth speakers or a sound bar to enhance the music. But unless you're a great distance from the projector, the 40W is more than enough.(EDIT on SOUND QUALITY) Many reviewers complain about the Nebula's speaker sound quality/volume when playing movies. This issue is specific to how certain movies' have recorded their soundtrack. Some movies have crystal clear dialogue and sound beds. While others sound muddy and have dialogue that sounds muffled. An example of this sound issue is \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\" In the case of this movie, Harrison Ford's dialogue always sounds muffled because he's mumbling. But when he yells, the dialog is clearly audible. Sound on TV shows and YouTube videos are much, much clearer.\u2022 THE VERDICT: If you're looking for a versatile, weather-proof projector that has everything built-in (portability, incredible video quality, rich speakers, streaming capabilities, long-lasting batteries, and the ability to function as a charging pack, flashlight, and Bluetooth speaker) this one is a no brainer. (If you plan on lugging this around, Anker makes a dedicated padded carrying case for the Nebula and all its accessories.)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I tried a few projectors starting with the Anker Nebula Solar. I like that model quite a bit but wanted something newer with a bit more power (If you want something almost as good but your budget is limited I highly suggest that model). I then tried the Samsung Freestyle which is horrible in every way, please do not waste your money. Next I tried the Xgimi Horizon Pro 4k. It was on sale but still at the higher end cost wise but promised a much better picture. It did have a high level of brightness but I was disappointed by the picture quality. Even though it projected native 4k the picture quality felt subpar to my 1080p Anker and no matter what motion setting I adjusted I could never get the picture to look right without the \u201cSoap Opera\u201d effect. I was about to splurge on the Anker Laser Cosmos 4k when I discovered Anker\u2019s newest model the Mars 3. It is not native 4k but accepts 4k signal. This confused me but the best way I can explain it is that it does not project native 4k but the high quality input signal puts out what I suppose could be described as 1080p+(less pixels but HDR, enhanced sound, and a surprisingly sharp image). I am so happy I went with this model. Not only is it 1000$ cheaper than the 4k model but it has so many cool features that make it portable. I like the AI image feature. That automatically adjusts the brightness based on your environment. Also out of any projector I have experienced the included speakers are fantastic. Since this model is meant to be taken around the house and outdoors Anker put the strongest speakers of any model into this baby. I considered getting external speakers for my Solar, but with the Mars 3 I am extremely happy with the built in sound. My two issues which I hope can be easily fixed by a software update is that there is some lag as far as loading and menu navigation with the remote. It is not terrible, no where near as awful as the Samsung Freestyle but still noticeable. I didn\u2019t feel that was enough to lower my rating a star but something to think about. Also this does not come with native Netflix. There is a easy workaround by using an included Anker app however the experience is still not great. My suggestion is to just plug a Fire TV or Roku stick in if you use Netflix. You can pick one up for around $20. Again annoying but not worth losing a star. If you are debating different brands and models and looking at laser/4k try this first. I think most people will be happy with it and it is so much cheaper than the 4k models out there.",

Really seems like user experience was highly considered - little details everywhere make you feel like you're in good hands. Image quality and brightness are solid, but keep in mind you're not getting what you would be for a non-portable projector in this price range.Cons:- Software and apps are pretty sluggish, so far no major issues there though.- Really wish there was a quicker, more reliable way to adjust auto-focus and keystone - your options are slightly reposition the projector and hope it recalibrates automatically, or go through a pretty tedious menu system.- The tripod mount, which was one of the features I was most excited about, is horribly positioned (see photo). There is no room to mount a plate onto the bottom thread, I've tried a few different tripods... will require are spacer, but not sure I'll even have room for that.",
