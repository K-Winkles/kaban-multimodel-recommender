We've owned projector's for around 20 years now. When they first started coming out, they were bulky and expensive. This projector is neither but offers such a better picture quality than I had hoped for. It's easily mobile and easy to use. Yah, the speakers aren't great but would you expect them to be? Why would you use the projector speakers anyways? If you're buying a projector, you want an experience right?If you want an 8k pixel TV and feel like you're in the movie, feel free to spend a lot of money. If you want excellent 4k picture quality, hook up your own soundbar and have an amazing night with the family at a great price, this is for you. Absolutely no complaints.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a good quality projector at a reasonable price. After reading about many different projectors, I settled on the Goodee YG600. It is a sleek-looking machine. The focus and keystone knobs are easy to maneuver. The navigation buttons on the projector and remote took some getting used to, but they're relatively simple to use. The brightness is more than enough to be able to see the image even with the lights on in our living room. I'm looking forward to trying this outside before it's dark. I think the image will still be visible in low sunlight. Even though the projector does not have a native 1080p, it supports 1080p input and the image quality is very clear. I am able to connect my cable box via HDMI; I already have an HDMI cable, but the projector came with an HDMI cable as well. I am also able to connect my iPhone to the projector, but I had to buy a separate lightning-to-HDMI adapter. One complaint I have is that the User Guide is not very useful. It is translated into English from another language, but the translation is absolutely horrible. I could understand what was written in the guide, but reading the run-on sentences, poor grammar, and misspellings was frustrating. Overall, for being my first projector, I think this was a good purchase. The price was within my budget (I got a bit of a discount on Amazon) and my family and I have been impressed with the image quality. So far, I am very happy with this projector.",

                "reviewText": "First off; I\u2019ve only used the projector once. I will update this review as time goes on and I use it more.-Background: This is my first projector so I did quite a bit of research trying to find something that worked for me. Once I started researching I ended up going down the rabbit hole so to speak. There\u2019s so many things to keep in mind when buying one (lumens, bulb life, throwback distance, number of connection ports, connectivity to external speakers, whether or not the bulb is replaceable, etc. I learned all this while researching and reading other people\u2019s reviews so take your time and do some reading too).I first bought an Epson projector because it\u2019s a \u201cbrand\u201d name. It was beautiful and easy to navigate. I didn\u2019t even have to read the instructions BUT I returned it because it turned out to be a pain to try and attach external speakers to it.-What I was looking for: A simple projector to watch movies outdoors with the family (we have two nieces ages 6 and 4). I didn\u2019t want something super expensive because I knew that we would only use it a few times a year, hence it made no sense to me to spend a ton of money on a projector AND external speakers. I just wanted something fun for the girls (let\u2019s face it, what do kids know about great movie/sound quality?)We\u2019re not picky people so I wasn\u2019t looking for movie theater quality picture and sound. All I wanted was something fun to share with the family.-What I found: If you\u2019re looking for movie theater quality picture and sound you\u2019re going to HAVE to spend thousands of dollars on a projector and external speakers. If that\u2019s not a problem for you, then go for it. If you\u2019re just looking to have some fun with the family find something that won\u2019t break the bank BUT remember that you get what pay for. So if you buy one of those $99 projectors, don\u2019t expect greatness.-Pros: GREAT family projector.Picture is clear and crisp. Easy to navigate once you figure out how to do it ; )Giant screen if you have the room to move your projector back so you get the screen size you want. We played an hour and forty movie for the girls and when it was over the projector was not hot. Not even warm to the touch. We did not notice the noise from the fan at all but keep in mind that we were outdoors and not sitting next to it. I did try it indoors first to figure out how to use it and even then I did not think the fan was very loud.-Cons: Despite what the product description says, the projector speakers ARE NOT LOUD. You are going to need external speakers.The instructions for the projector are written weird. It\u2019s really hard to understand them but after playing around for a few minutes I had it down. It\u2019s not rocket science so don\u2019t let that deter you from getting this projector.BOTTOM LINE: So far I\u2019m totally happy with this projector. I recommend it if like us, you\u2019re looking to have fun with your family. Our first outdoor movie night went great.For sound I bought a 25ft long audio/video cable and connected that to the headphone jack of the projector and then I connected the other end to one of those Costco square portable black speakers and that worked for us. I also tried it with the computer speakers we have and that worked too (indoors, when I was trying to figure out what to use for sound).I already had a VGA cable to connect my iPad/iPhone to the projector via their included HDMI cable and stream Disney+ for the movie we saw.Again, I\u2019m very happy with this purchase and I recommend it.I will update my review as we get more use out of it.",

                "reviewText": "After setting up the projection system outside at a distance of 10 feet it created a screen size of 86 inches by 51 inches. I also mounted a projection screen on a flat sheet of MDF that made the image of the projector really pop out. I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity of not only the image but the edge clarity (this is a common problem with projection systems). The edges were as sharp as the center was. After looking at some sporting events I was also pleased with the lack of delay or jerkiness during the fast action across the screen. The brightness (LUX and Lumens) is outstanding. The multiple input ports are great for connecting different source types. It does create quite a bit of heat that you have to make allowances for if you put it in a box as I did for keeping it outside hanging under our patio roof. It would be a nice feature (maybe future enhancement) to have a sizing mechanism so that it could be mounted at any distance (within reason) and create the screen size you want. I had to measure exactly the distance between the projector and screen to get the correct screen dimensions to fit within the screen size I had mounted on the wall. Remote focus also would be nice. Another feature to add would be an automatic lens cover that opens when the unit powers up. I am sure the price would be more for these additions but may be worth it. The speakers are adequate for indoors but I used the 3mm headphone port to drive a small sound system. For the price this is a great value for creating a large screen for viewing your media.",
