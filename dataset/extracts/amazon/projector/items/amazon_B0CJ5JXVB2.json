After the projector completes the automatic focus process, you can fine-tune the focus by using the \"F+\" and \"F-\" buttons on the remote control to achieve the best image quality. AUTO KEYSTONE CORRECTION Get a perfect rectangular picture within 5 seconds after starting up! Additionally, when the projector detects shaking or rapid movement, it triggers automatic keystone correction to ensure the image is always perfectly aligned without the need for manual adjustments! If you think the shape is not perfectly enough, you can also utilize the four-point keystone correction to manually correct the image shape. INTELLIGENT OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE The intelligent obstacle avoidance feature enables the projector to automatically adjust its displayed content to avoid obstacles like paintings, plants, or other objects. Before enabling intelligent obstacle avoidance, make sure auto keystone correction is enabled. Please be aware that it may not recognize white or transparent tape as obstacles. INTELLIGENT SCREEN ALIGNMENT The industry-leading technology of intelligent screen adaption enables the projector to automatically adjust its image to match your screen size. When activating the intelligent screen alignment, use a 16:9 aspect ratio screen with black borders for optimal results. Please know that when both intelligent obstacle avoidance and intelligent screen alignment functions are enabled simultaneously, priority is given to intelligent screen alignment, with intelligent obstacle avoidance being secondary.",

                "reviewText": "Good Projector. The delivery was on time and box was undamaged. Easy to set up just plug in and go. Picture is crisp and bright even with the light on in the room. Sound is good for a little speaker. The projector worked flawlessly once powered up, hdmi usb and casting. The remote works great even when not pointed at the ir receiver. The remote needs two AAA batteries. The Bluetooth feature worked well when connected to a portable speaker. Volume control while using Bluetooth was flawless. The controls on the projector were a nice surprise and worked well. Focus adjustment knob was smooth and worked well. The cooling fan is quiet and the volume is not overwhelming. The carrying handle is a nice feature and makes for easy setup. The small size will be great for storage when not in use. We watched a netflix movies and I was quite impressed with the overall picture no blurred moments or pauses. The projector shipped with an av cable, hdmi cable and power cord. A storage bag would of been a great addition to this package to keep it dust free. There is also a lens protector that is easily attached and removed. Watching movies from the usb port worked amazing with no issues. This projector will be great on camping trips where space is an issue. All and all this projector is a good bang for your buck! Auto focus makes it easier to focus and did amazing job! Recommend",

I have tried four different projectors at this point, and I have a slightly nicer, brighter, better sounding one, but this balance of price and features of this one might actually be my favorite. It's plenty bright, and it sounds about as good as a TV without a separate soundbar.The autofocus works like a million bucks, and it focuses automatically every time you turn it on, and there's an option for it to refocus if you move the projector around. If the image is still blur, shake the monitor a bit and the auto focus will be in function again.I haven't had very good luck with the auto-Keystone adjustment, but I think that's because the environment around my 100\" screen is too busy for it to latch onto the perimeter. But the on-screen manual adjustment is quick and intuitive and does a great job. It has some smart-TV selections built in, like Netflix and YouTube, but I use a $20 dongle to bring in all of our subscribed services like YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video. This also allows a Bluetooth connection to our TV's soundbar.",
