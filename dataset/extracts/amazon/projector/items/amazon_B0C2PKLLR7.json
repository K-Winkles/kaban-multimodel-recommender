                "reviewText": "Not a standard looking projector. It\u2019s smaller than it looks in the pictures. It\u2019s light plastic, but durable enough for its purpose. It looks like a mini tower computer about 6 inches tall, and yes, it has a little pink carry strap. My wife says it\u2019s adorable.Anyway, this thing projects very brightly. I\u2019ve only tested indoors, close-up on my basement wall in daytime, but I can tell it will project well on my large 120\u201d outdoor screen for movie nights. (By the way, if you\u2019re looking for a good quality outdoor movie screen I suggest searching \u201cJWSIT projector screen 120 inch\u201d on Amazon for about $200.)The focus wheel on top is pretty precise. Runs cool, does not throw heat even after being on for a while.This thing is more than just a projector though. This is a full Android device that easily connected to my home WIFI within minutes, right out of the box. It\u2019s like a an Android tablet that projects rather than having a touchscreen; instead you use a remote control. Netflix, YouTube, Crunchy Roll, and other apps came pre-installed. There is access to the Android App Store to download other apps. I was able to search for and download/install Amazon Prime video, Plex, etc. The built in android \u201ccomputer\u201d is not super powerful so it a little slow to respond and load things, but with a good WIFI connection I have successfully streamed hi-def video with no problem.I am not a regular Android user. I use Apple iOS mostly, so there was a little bit of a learning curve for me. And after a few days I still find it difficult to smoothly navigate through the apps using a remote control with arrow buttons, as opposed to a touch screen that android was designed for. I\u2019ll get used to it. Remote requires two \u201cAAA\u201d batteries (not included).Onboard it has a tiny speaker with low quality sound, just like any other projector. So if you\u2019re going to seriously watch a movie with this thing, you\u2019ll want to connect it to a Bluetooth speaker or you can use the standard 3/4\u201d headphone audio output jack (cable not included) to connect to an stereo system. I was successfully able to connect to a pair of Bluetooth JBL flip 5 speakers to test it, but for my next backyard movie night I\u2019ll connect it to my trusty old Visio sound-bar with subwoofer. Sounds great.I can even see myNot just for big outdoor movie nights. My kid is satisfied just plugging headphones in and watching you tube videos on her bedroom wall.The projector has two standard USB inputs for firesticks or thumb drive media. There is NO HDMI input, so you can\u2019t connect a DVD player unless you figure out some sort of HDMI to USB adapter. The manual says you can mirror your Android phone or iPhone screen, but I have not tried that and I know some apps (Netflix for example) will not allow it.The projector unexpectedly came with a mini table-top tripod. Handy. But I\u2019ll use a full size camera tripod to get it level with my outdoor screen. If you\u2019re projecting at an angle from the ceiling or floor the image will naturally distort to a trapezoid. To correct that, the manual says there is a digital keystone (trapezoidal) adjustment, but I have not played with that yet.Does not come with a lens cap or a case, so I\u2019m going to keep the box and packing materials.For the price, I think this is an amazing consumer/basic-level device. It\u2019 does the job and it\u2019s just so much easier to setup without having to hook up an external Roku or DVD player and run wires to speakers.",

                "reviewText": "Wont say much but it works well. I have the newer version and it has worked exactly as it is designed.Built in android can be a bit slow but if you are patient it is rather not a big deal, maybe the delay is from the remote.Every app known to me works, google play works and logs in perfectly and everything updates fine.Projector did update its software so they do keep it up.2g wifi or 5g wifi works well.Runs everything smoothly. 4k has not been an issue.Xbox beta works well. So if you want to play xbox one games remotely from your console from the internet on to here it runs it well.Hdmi works fine.Used it off and on for months. Not once it has frooze or gotten hot. Fan is not loud unless u r an ignorant human being with ignorant expectations claming so.Clear image and very well focused. If you are not centered in height and balanced, corners could be faded just a tad bit from far away.Sound is clear but...the only thing that does not do well is bluetooth sound being sent to a speaker. It just skips but it does not do so with auxiliary out. Tried different bluetooth speakers and distance and it may need judt an adjustment.1080p native from the android software and the projector itself. Only with hdmi it can receive 4k but still do everything in 1080p. So just act like no 4k exist with this model but i assure you this whole android and projector in one is rather nice and has performed well.Run games exactly just like a firestick or ruku would. Usb works well for power or media files.Runs well wirelessly or by hdmi from a laptop.Iphone or android has done perfeclty well with casting things over. No skips full 1080p stream.Will upload a pic another day",

                "reviewText": "This is a very powerful projector for its size and price! I think it's really cool that it has so many apps, but the interface does need some work. Sometimes it's hard to navigate the apps, and you have to switch to mouse mode which is pretty cumbersome. I have some connectivity issues sometimes when trying to connect my phone via Bluetooth and haven't been able to figure it out yet, but it seems like the software updates continually so hopefully it will get better!My main issue with this projector is that I put it on the wall very far away so I really wanted a projector with a zoom out function to make the screen size smaller. Unfortunately, it does this not by zooming with the lens, but by just making the image smaller on the screen (hope that makes sense) so the resolution goes down. Even so, it does what I need it to and I really like it overall!",
