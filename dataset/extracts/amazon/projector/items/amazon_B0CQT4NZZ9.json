She worked hard and saved her money up to get the device. I wanted to make sure that her investment would last. She is careful but drops and tumbles happen. My biggest concern is that a tumble would result in a cracked screen. These screen protectors have a couple of things that I like. They look and feel well made. I am not concerned that they would fail to protect my daughter's device. The screen protectors came with a guide which was super helpful. The screen protectors are a nice addition to my daughter's Switch. The help protect her device's screen and don't negatively affect its performance.",

The image quality is clearly visible even when projected on larger surfaces. The built-in speakers, while not very powerful, are enough for a comfortable movie experience. It's portable and lightweight, which means we can even take it with us on camping trips.",
