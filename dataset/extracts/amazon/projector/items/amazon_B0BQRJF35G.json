                "reviewText": "The picture quality is quite good. Screen on the wall is pretty nice for me and my girlfriend. We enjoy movies and TV shows in the evening.The projector is not big and easy to carry on if go outside. Camera supports dynamic angle with screws. I am also surprised with the sound quality but I still connect it to another audio device because it is a little noisy when running.The price is good currently with nice performance. And the projector supports multiple ways to connect: HDMI, AirPlay, etc which are pretty convenient for me (Instruction is good~~~). It works well with my PC, iPad and iPhone. No problem found till now.Overall 4.7/5~ The first time trying a projector, nice experience.",

                "reviewText": "This projector is great, and I would like to go into some detail.First, the resolution is fully clear with 1080p, some other projectors that claim this are not quite up to par. It makes such a clear picture indoor and outdoors.Next, the connection is easy, fast, and fast bandwidth, and can use 5G, which results in not stuttering like in other ones.Lastly, the color gamut and the contrast is amazing. Ive owned projectors before that you cant really tel the difference between pitch black and gray, in glad this one is so vibrant.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the second projector I bought because I love movie nights! This one was far better than the previous one I had, the previous was way too dark and not clear at all, it was similar in price too! Mind you have this on a brown wall and it\u2019s STILL clear. I use it with my treadmill usually and watch while I walk and it\u2019s perfect. You can move it further back if u want it bigger. You screw it on to the tripod and it\u2019s that simple. I bought a white screen thinking I need a white bg but you don\u2019t so save ur money (unless you\u2019re doing it outside or sth) the only thing I would say is when u turn it off, the control buttons stay blue so I usually unplug it just in case. For the price and the quality, I really do recommend it. Plus my cat loves it ;)",

We had all the set up done for movie night in our back yard everything was great just no movie. IT WAS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.",
