We had a great time using this projector for the first time at a community movie night. The setup process was easy, the layout and controls were intuitive, and menu navigation was effortless. I found that after placing the projector in the ideal location, it only took a few minutes of digital keystone adjustment to get a perfect fit. It's worth noting that the trapezoid adjustment is completely digital, with no manual knobs or adjustment levers.The projector's own speakers also performed very clearly. I connected the projector to my laptop via the included HDMI cable and all went smoothly. We projected the image onto a 200-inch screen and the image quality was outstanding. It was vivid, clear, sharp and bright! Definitely comparable to movie theater quality.Overall, this is an excellent projector and definitely worth spending the extra money on Amazon to avoid buying a cheap model.",

                "reviewText": "I've been very impressed by this projector. It's very capable for its compact size with great brightness, sound, and functionality. It's great to have Netflix and Prime right on it (don't need another device for the projector to connect to) and the autofocus and auto keystone functions are really helpful. Everything is controlled by the remote, and while there are buttons that are a tiny bit confusing, it only takes a minute to figure it all out.Was glad it came with a screen and we were impressed with some of the other games and apps that it came with. We've been having fun playing connect 4 on the ceiling. It comes with the expected cables and gear for the screen. I was a little nervous about the hinge/platform but it works very well. All in all, a great set up!",

This projector does cost more, but it genuinely performs amazingly.It comes with a HDMI cable, AV adapter cable, power cable, a projector screen, and a remote (the remote batteries aren't included, so make sure to have some AAA batteries in hand or add to order).The image quality is really good. This along with the auto focus and keystone feature makes it such a great projector. You just need to angle the projector toward your wall/screen, and these features automatically fixes any distortion in the image. Just these things alone make the projector worth the price.The sound is also pretty good. I mostly use it indoor, and it can definitely get loud. So far I've been very happy with the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I was not sure what to expect. The last projector, from many years ago. was four times the price and burned incandescent bulbs frequently. This VOPLLS uses an LED as the bulb and it is surprisingly bright. I just tested it in the office with the provided projection sheet and was very happy. This projector started immediately and automatically adjusted keystone and focus. It projects its own pattern and uses that to set the keystone so the picture is perfectly square no matter how far off center the projector is. It is like magic, having had to do this manually in other devices. In addition, it sets the \"keystone\" in BOTH directions, up and down and left to right. When it starts the first time, it walks you through getting hooked to the Wi-Fi and that worked perfectly the first time. It then came right up like a \"Smart TV\" with selections for Netflix, Youtube, Amazon and more, built in. So, once you log in by scanning a 2D barcode, you are right in the app for that service. The remote control has an excellent feel and the buttons are well-placed, especially the back button. I actually bought this for a little different reason. I make (poor) sculptures and often need to cut out pieces of sheet steel (22gauge). I draw then in Photoshop or other program and need to project them on a sheet of steel (4'x8') to trace them. I then cut them out with hand or power shears. Other projectors are not bright enough and have to be lined up perfectly. This is now perfect for my needs, as it adjusts to a square projection and is bright enough to use in the daytime in the shop with windows. I can send the images to it from my phone and I have a ton of flexibility. Overall, I am thrilled with this new addition to my shop. And I can watch some welding videos from it in between projects. Highly recommended.",

Happy to report I have been pleasantly surprised. Set-up is easy (don't forget to only agree to updates, rather than agreeing to everything, since that includes access to your usage data, which you might not be comfy with - I'm not, but it's easy to say no to), auto-focus was quick and accurate, and we were quickly away. Netflix, Prime Video and YouTube all come pre-installed, plus there are HDMI and USB sockets for other sources, plus you can cast to this from Android or iPhone/iPad. All in all, very versatile! Minor niggles - the audio from the in-built speaker is adequate but lacking, as you might expect from a speaker in a small plastic enclosure, but this is easily circumvented by Bluetoothing to the speaker of your choice. Oh, and the fan could be quieter. It's not loud, but I've heard quieter. But otherwise, all good, especially at this price.",

Just login and watch. Other media can be accessed as well. I can stream from my NAS system, android or idevices via wifi, Bluetooth, hdmi or usb.Autofocus had a crystal clear picture on my wall within seconds. Ijust found the sound quality to be lacking due to the builtin speaker. However connecting my soundbar via bluetooth solved that issue.",

                "reviewText": "This smart projector is a plug in and play solution for getting smart apps and entertainment quickly and easily. The controller needs 2 AAA batteries (not included), and once plugged in after the initial setup it\u2019s ready to use with apps like Netflix and Youtube already pre-installed. The projector already has a built in speaker that is quite decent and can output loud enough sound with enough bass for casual viewing - it is very quick and easy to get picture and sound up and running in a light compact package.The projector has a gunmetal grey colour which you could easily mistake for metal, but upon opening I was a little disappointed to see a full plastic build, even for the base and hinge which make it quite cheap feeling. The remote has nice clickly tactile buttons with a soft touch finish, and it has quick buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, Youtube and a Web Browser.I was very happy to see the projector has auto-focus which runs automatically as it sets what it thinks is the best focus level for you, but you can always adjust it manually and turn off the auto focus options if you prefer. Picture quality is 1080p and looks crisp and colourful for the price point. I did notice the edges tend to look more blurry, but for causal viewing for films and games it performs very well.The projector is running \u2018Linux OS\u2019 which seems to be a smart TV distro with added projector features. Whilst this operating system has a nice simple design, it isn\u2019t as \u2018mature\u2019 as other popular systems like Android or Google TV and thus has more limited app support which is important to keep in mind if you were wanting to run Android Apps on it.Overall, whilst this projector is easy to setup and get up and running quickly, it\u2019s build quality is not the best. It\u2019s clear that the money has been spent on the internals rather than the exterior build, but it does make it feel cheap with how light it is. Picture quality is very good overall, and aside for some blurring around the edges for basic viewing needs it does very well - however springing for more expensive options would yield better brightness and colour reproduction.",
