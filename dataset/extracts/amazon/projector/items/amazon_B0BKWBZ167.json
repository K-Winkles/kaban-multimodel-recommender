                "reviewText": "I purchased this projector for a simple home theater project in the attic and a video game setup in the garage. Its small size makes this unit very portable which is exactly what I needed for my use cases. The initial setup was very easy and I like the ability to connect wirelessly to my iPhone or via a physical USB or HDMI cable. The projector comes with built-in speakers so for simple setups like mine, it's all I needed.The 1080p video came out looking crisp and sharp. The projector is bright enough to use during the daytime in shaded environments. There is a noticeable fan noise but overall I think that comes with the territory of using projectors. The included 100-foot screen is a nice bonus but I'll be purchasing another screen that comes on a stand. (The included screen requires you to hang and stretch)Overall I'm happy with the purchase and what this small projector can do for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have had quite a few of these projectors in the past. The weak link was usually the lumens, as they were pretty dim and could only be used in the dark. Second issue was that I had to have them hooked up to speakers wired, rather than bluetooth. This unit is a great improvement over the old ones, and the best part IT IS BRIGHT! The onboard speaker is ok, but you have bluetooth to send it to your sound system so you can have the sound be as robust as you want.I hooked it up to a plug in streaming unit, and within seconds I had it up and running on a big wall in the house with no problem. Very good connectivity, and the resolution is 1080 so plenty sharp too. I have used them before outside in summer, and what is also great is that it comes with a screen too! the remote also worked with no issues.In all, a very capable unit with screen with super connectivity for sound and inputs.",

                "reviewText": "I would say this projector is pretty good quality for the price. It has a lot of features, comes with a screen, and it also has an internal speaker that gets pretty loud. This might just be a projector thing, but its hard to get the entire picture for movies to come out completely clear from edge to edge. It's also decent to watch movies with some light on too, the picture is still super visible. Overall I'm happy with it for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I had been searching for a projector for a while. After a lot of research I decided on this projector from Fudoni. I wanted something that was great for outdoor movie nights.This projector is not like the ones we grew up with in school. This has a very crisp picture, even at a larger size of 300 inches. It really feels like I have a personal movie theater in my backyard.I tested a few different configurations:iPhone with HDMI AdapterMost of the apps worked as anticipated with this method. However, Disney+ detected a device that it was not supported being played on. This is probably due to copyrights.Amazon Fire StickEvery app I tried, including Disney+ worked as anticipated.The speakers on the projector are great if you\u2019re in a pinch, however I strongly recommend using an external speaker for an even better experience. You can pair this with Bluetooth or directly using an aux cord. I also recommend getting an adapter to hook your phone or tablet to the projector via HDMI.What I love most about this projector is the clarity. It comes with a 100 inch screen that provides a great viewing experience. I even went larger, the size of my entire carport and it still had phenomenal clarity.This is my first projector and the setup process is very easy. The device itself is small, lightweight and very portable. You will definitely be happy with this projector.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to buy this projector after seeing a great YouTube video from an electric channel. I plugged the projector in, connected it to my internet service, and tested the Bluetooth, Mira cast, and HDMI connections. Everything works as advertised. I was pleasantly surprised with the internal speaker sound quality. This speaker is good for instances when you're using the projector in a small room, but if you want to use this in an outdoor setting, I recommend that you get an external speaker. What really caught my attention was the image quality. Even in a somewhat lit room, the projected image kept its vivid colors and sharpness.",

Picture is clear even in daylight, it comes with its own hangable projection screen that is cloth material, also comes with any cables you need. It is very easy to set up. I hooked up an Amazon fire stick and had no problems getting it to work. My kids absolutely love it, the sound quality is clear, it has a focus knob at the top that you can scroll right or left to adjust the focus and it has a keystone knob that adjust whether the lens tilts a certain way to help adjust the picture , it is very user-friendly. I have added pictures and a video to show what comes with it, how it looks out of the box, what it looks like projected during the day, so you can see how clear the picture looks even in the daytime. For the money I feel like this projector is a great purchase, and would recommend.",
