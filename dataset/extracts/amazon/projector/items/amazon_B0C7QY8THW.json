                "reviewText": "First things first, for the price, I don't think you can get a better or brighter picture, which is what I was looking for because I have this mounted under my covered patio. Not bright enough to get a great picture mid-day or in direct sunlight. But once the sun starts to go down around, it's really great. And at night? FANTASTIC! Super satisfied. But if you need something during the day, you're going to need spend a lot more on a laser projector.The speaker was surprisingly good. When I bought this, I figured I'd need to get a cheap soundbar, but it really wasn't necessary. If you're buying this as your main TV, maybe you get a better audio system, especially if you're going for \"immersive.\" But for my purposes, the sound was actually better than expected.I recommend getting a small streaming device to connect to it. At the time of this review, it\u2019s running some bad Android operating system. It does have a few good options, including the popular ones like Disney+, Max, Netflix, and Hulu. It's missing Peacock, Tablo (an app I use to stream and record live TV), and the Paramount+ and Prime Video apps don't work (pretty much every app used to stream football). This could all be fixed with a software update (which it can do wirelessly). If I see one come in that fixes these issues, I\u2019ll update the review.In the end though, it\u2019s a solid product. It feels like it\u2019s made with quality materials. The picture is fantastic in low light, and the sound is excellent for a built-in speaker. Pairing it up with a Roku or Chromecast will solve your streaming problems.",

The image quality, even focus, auto-focus feature, and colour balance on this one are much better.Unfortunately, this orange burn-in(?) developed after a couple weeks and keeps getting worse. It is not as noticeable when there are bright colors on the screen, but against black it is more apparent. We never left a static image or menu open for long, and have tried leaving it off for a few days to see if it helped. Hopefully ours is just defective...Update: Informed that my unit was in fact defective, and judging from reading the other reviews and lack of similar complaints, I would say this is a very rare occurrence and just an unfortunate defect in an otherwise quality product. The customer service was prompt and helpful in getting this sorted for us.",
