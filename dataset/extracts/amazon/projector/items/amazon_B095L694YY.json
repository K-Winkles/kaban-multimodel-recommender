                "reviewText": "I was lucky enough to get mine on sale after tax it was $37.00 once I got it I was impressed by the packaging and the projector materials. Then I turned it on and I was blown away by the color accuracy and sharpness of the picture. This is my 5th projector and by far the cheapest it holds its own against my $800 projector i bought in march this year 2023. To say im impressed is a gross understatement. Without a doubt if you are looking for a 1080p projector just buy this you can't go wrong for the price. I promise you will not have any regrets! Thank you miroir for having such an amazing product at a price everyone can afford!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Miroir L300 in June, and since then I have used it for a few movie nights and sports nights.Picture Quality is okay at the price range it was in June of 2022, around $100, but it's not going to compare to a TV or a name-brand projector like Epson or BenQ.Brightness is a big issue with this projector, and most of these cheaper end projectors, because of their light source. They also use LCD lumens instead of ANSI Lumens, that's something to pay attention to as the big brands use ANSI which usually means the image is brighter. Playing video games where there are dark areas is almost impossible, even in Fortnite it was darker in spots than I care for and that game is cartoon colored. Speaking of cartoons, that is where this projector does its best work, cartoons or kids' movies that are brightly colored, we enjoyed Spongebob Squarepants and Up on it.The sound quality was decent, I was pleasantly surprised when I could hear everything I needed to hear in whatever I watched without resorting to using a different speaker, although a Bluetooth or 3.5mm stereo speaker option is definitely better than the internal.I knew at the price I paid that it wasn't going to be the latest, greatest technology when Epson and BenQ are going for 600+, so I don't have a lot of complaints on that, but it suffers the same problem as Vankyo, they get dust in them even if you keep them in their box and covered. By the third use, the projected image had a spec or two of dust and there's no way into the internals to get that dust-out. From experience with Vankyo, I know canned air is just going to make it worse and you are stuck with the dust specs and it's horrible. I keep bringing up Vankyo because I wouldn't be surprised if these are made in the same factory, they have almost identical software, except for some reason Miroir chooses not to allow you to change any settings having to do with brightness, color, etc where Vankyo usually allows it.Yet, for the price paid, I think I got my monies worth out of it, a couple of sports events at 80\" and a half dozen movies too, I would have spent more at a sports bar or the movie theater for this size screen than I did for this device.If you are looking for something to dip your toe into projectors or just for a few movie nights and aren't going to be disappointed by needing an almost completely dark room and still having a sometimes dark image and dust specs, this could be for you. Don't knock it until you try it I guess, but I tried it and kind of wish I had waited on something better. Since they don't allow half stars I'm giving the device a 3 out of 5.",

                "reviewText": "The projector was bright/clear enough to take my fire stick outside to enjoy. The third time I used it, it made a pop sound from the speaker and the light cut off. Now it just turns on with no audio or video output and even the internal fan stopped running. It\u2019s really cheaply made but, the output is fine for taking a movie outside with the kiddo\u2019s. Just make sure you test it well during the first 30 days as they may not be built well enough to stand the test of time. For me, 3 days was not acceptable.",
