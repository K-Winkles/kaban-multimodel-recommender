                "reviewText": "Very nice product. When I received it, I have was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It's lightweight so it's easy to carry around on the go. When you go on a field trip, you can use it to watch a movie at night. Its Bluetooth connection is fast and stable. Its auto focus is very good and it plays very clearly no matter where it is placed. The picture it plays is very clear and the sound quality is very good. In addition, it has fast internal circulation heat dissipation, effectively blocking dust, and has a long service life. It has a small body and does not take up too much space. It is highly recommended to buy this product.",
