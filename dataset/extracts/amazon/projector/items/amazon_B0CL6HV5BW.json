                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was so exited to buy this projector. I often do \u201cmovie nights\u201d in my backyard, and I always wanted to take a projector with me when I go camping. This is a great little projector and I hope it lasts for years to come. It arrived well packaged and the setup was simple and fast. The remote control needs 2 AA batteries and works with no set up. I recommend changing the settings to Bluetooth for the remote control, it is easy to change and the manual shows it as one of the first steps in the set up. There is no app and the setup is done on the screen. So far I watched youtube videos, and an NFL game on this projector. I did not have a white screen yet but the videos were surprisingly good on a flat wall. The owners manual mentions a dust filter and I am assuming you have to clean it every so often to keep the projector in top condition.The Good:1- Easy to set up.2- You can use it as a \u201csmart\u201d TV via WiFi, or mirror your screen if you have an android phone or keep it simple and use the ports in the back and connect via the provided HDMI cable or even use the USB connection for a thumb drive or stick (Roku, Fire, etc...)3- The image is bright and clear. It is 1080P and support up-scaling to 4K. The image is easily twice as bright or more as some of the other projectors I used.4- The speaker is loud and clear and the volume can be controlled via the remote control. You can also connect it via cable or Bluetooth to an external speaker.5- The picture is impressive and you can easily adjust the angle of the screen on the wall. I started with the projector at about 8ft from the wall and I was able to measure about 85\u201d projection. For fun, I tried moving the projector back to see how big of a screen I can get. At 16ft from the wall the screen was very bright still and I measured over 200\u201d diagonal size with no loss of quality. I am not sure you need a 200\u201d screen inside the house but for outdoor use this is impressive. I can not wait to take this outside and try for a 300\u201d screen.6- Supports DLNA, so you are able to watch your videos from other computers/drives wirelessly7- Supports Bluetooth 5.0 and both 2.4G and 5G WiFi bands.8- RGB lighting on the top of the projector for extra cool looksThe bad:1- It is using android 1.0 as its base operation UI.2- I was able to log into my google account but not you-tube. I had to sign in as a guest.Verdict: Amazing picture, Bright Picture, Clear picture, Good colors, Good Sound and poor UI implementation (If used as smart TV). I would recommend this projector. 100% The picture is amazing, bright and HUUUGE!",

The picture quality was excellent and so easy to focus. Switching thru menus and apps were incredibly easy also. The volume from just from the projector is just loud enough for personal viewing. Did not set up to the sound bar yet but looking forward to family movie nights! Great gift for the movie lovers in your life!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty nice projector",
                "reviewText": "There is a lot to like about this projector. I have had a few different projectors over the years and I can definitely say that this one is very nice. I really appreciate how easy it is to set up and use right out of the box. I plugged in the projector and connected to my wifi without any problems. The menu is very easy to navigate and there are several apps loaded into the menu already. I signed in to several of my streaming services and was watching movies right away. I would say the entire process took about ten minutes. There are several nice features included, like the ability to download different apps, the ability to connect to devices (like Bluetooth speakers, phones, etc.), and 57 gig of storage space. You can also connect devices via USB and HDMI (no SD card slot if anyone was wondering), so connecting to virtually any device is very easy. As far as the picture goes, it really looks great. Even with full lights on in the room, the picture is crisp and easy to see. Focusing the picture is easy as well, with the manual focus on the side of the machine and keystone correction in the settings. The enclosed speaker is a nice addition, but is pretty quiet and not great for everyday use. For me, there are two reasons this is not a five star projector. First, my unit is louder than I would like. The fan (which has to constantly run) is a lot louder than my other projectors and I find it a bit distracting. Secondly, I really don\u2019t like the changing colors on the top of the projector. When I turn off my lights to watch a movie, I really don\u2019t want my projector to be constantly changing colors. There might be a way to turn this off, but I haven\u2019t found it yet. This might be a personal nitpick, but I really don\u2019t like the color changing feature. Other than those two complaints, this is a great projector. It\u2019s very easy to set up and use, the WiFi and Bluetooth work great, and the picture is outstanding. Overall, this is a very nice projector and I would recommend it.",
