Unboxing it I noticed it was packed very well and had almost everything I needed to start. The remote does not have batteries included and there is not a USBc cable included either. Be sure to pick these up if you're wanting to stream from your android phone or laptop with only USBc connections. The HDMI, RCA, and power cables were all there!Now it was easy to set up and the instructions were actually helpful.It has 2 HDMI inputs so you can have two different devices connected like a TV and its just switch inputs to view.I connected my PC and wow big and bright!The focus ring and keystone are side by side and this is a game changer. So easy to get it crisp this way!The internal speaker is loud enough to fill a prestation room with sound without the need for external speakers. It has an audio out small headphone jack for using external speakers.This model does not have Bluetooth connectivity.The 2 weeks of presentations and the night I was streaming Phish it worked flawlessly!This is worth buying and provides plenty if entertainment value!So stop reading this already and go by it!I will be using this to rear project the AtmosFX halloween videos ..I already tested it.. yea its gonna be awesomeness !",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this to have a low cost, budget friendly way of broadcasting Halloween video effects on a window and it served its purpose just fine. I had one already, an RCA w/bluetooth for another window.Only drawback is this one has no built in bluetooth for outputting sound so your only option for external speakers is music cable output. However I used it only for silent spooky effects and had no issue.Turns on fast, boots up quickly, remote is easy to use. The picture was actually broader (widthx height) than my other more expensive RCA home theater projector. I don't plan to use it for actual home theater purposes but it seems to be suitable so long as you are okay with hard wiring a speaker or using the internal speaker.",

                "reviewText": "We got this for camping or going to friends and hanging outside. The speakers do get a decent volume when you go though the sound options and fiddle, but it's a little hard to get the whole screen pixel perfect though. You need it sitting directly straight with no tilt to the lense for it all to be clear. It does seem to get hot pretty fast which is worrying for how long it will last. Fingers crossed we can at least use it a whole summer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this projector because I needed something for impromptu movie nights with friends and family. The product came quickly and the packaging was very protective of the contents. It came with audio cables, power cable, hdmi, and lense cleaner. There is also a remote (pictured) to control volume of the projector and the various menus.Setting up the projector was easy. It has a connector in the bottom to use with a tripod if you so desired and that\u2019s what I did. Installation was easy and once I had it adjusted to my desired size of screen I just moved the dial to print the picture into focus. Picture quality is crisp and the bulb is bright.The thing I love this for best is when we are hosting some families with list of children for a party. I\u2019d things start to get noisy I can set up this projector very quickly and have a movie on for the kids in no time flat. The internal speaker is loud enough for everyone to hear and the fan for the projector is nice and quiet.The size of the projector makes it easy to store and keep safe. Overall I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase.",

It also has 3.5mm audio out and analog AV in. This is definitely built to be a replacement for a traditional TV. You could hook everything up to this and use it as your main screen. The picture is very bright and clear and has a good range, you could get a giant picture from this.The main thing that jumped out at me is the loud sound, much louder than any other projector I've used. You could get away with not using an external speaker if you are ok with not having much bass.Also some tiny things to note - it does have an attachment for a tripod which is useful. It comes with AV and HDMI cables. Only thing missing is a 3.5mm audio cable but those are easy to come by.Overall a very solid projector with everything I need. I will be using this for many weekly outdoor movie nights with the guys.",

I position it about 8 feet from a blank wall which gives a screen about 3 meters wide and it's very bright and clear at that size. The speakers aren't fantastic, so I use a bluetooth speaker to provide sound and that works perfectly. Fan is a little loud, but if you want one that's very quiet you're going to need to spend 4-5 times the cost of this one. Very happy with this purchase.",
