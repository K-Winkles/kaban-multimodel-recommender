                "reviewText": "I bought this projector to use for outside movie nights with my family. When I saw this mini projector I was somewhat hesitant to buy it because it was listed so cheap. You always think if you buy cheap you get cheap but this is not thE case.When I got the projector it came with everything to set it up and use it right out of the box. I tried every input type to ensure it worked. I was able to watch a movie off a flash drive, I plugged a Kindle Fire stick into it, I\u2019ve played with my switch and my xBox One on it. It has been an amazing little machine.Indoors quality is really good. You do need a darkened room but I could low amounts of light in the right circumstances doesn\u2019t feminist the quality a whole lot but you\u2019re not going to use the projector in a lit room anyway. So far I\u2019ve been able to project up to the specified largest screen size and found that the projector works well. It does become a little pixelated at the largest projection rate but for what I paid for this projector it was not an issue I would complain about.My living room television went out and I\u2019m currently using this projector in its place until my television gets repaired. I worried at fist about extended use, wondering if it would over heat, but after several weeks of use and 1 full 10-12 hours running in 1 day I find this little projector is worth the purchase price.As you can see in the photos I have my mini projector mounted on a camera tripod, which easily screws into the leveler screw on the bottom front of the projector. I use a JBL Flip 4 speaker or a large portable Karaoke speaker I\u2019ve had for a while.If you\u2019re looking for a mini projector for outdoors fun or even as a gaming projector this one is a great investment. I have had 0 issues with this projector and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how long the projector lamp will last before needing to be replaced.Photo one is the projector in my wife\u2019s school office at home. Screen size comparable to 60\u201d television.Photo two is outside projected on a cinder block wall that has not been prepped or painted for projection. Screen size comparable to 110\u201d television.Photo 3 is in my living room projected onto the wall where my revision is usually mounted. At this location I did have to add some blackout curtains to block more light. Screen size comparable to 80\u201d television.As you can see the picture is really clear in each photo.Buy this projector and have loads of fun with your family and friends.",

                "reviewText": "We are new to the projector world. We enclosed our back porch and had music, but felt that tv was missing. After looking at tons of projectors We decided on this one. It wasn't super pricey and the reviews were good for it. It plays well and clear, we did a movie night it was AWESOME!!!! I started before it got dark (the sun was in) and a tan curtain was our screen and it was like sitting inside watching TV. You do have to buy the cord to connect to your phone to stream from your phone, it was only $13-$14 bucks. Make sure you get the right one. I have a Droid. It's simple to operate once I got the hang and I am very pleased. The reviews also said the volume isn't good. I kinda agree, if it's a couple people (and quiet) it's fine, for larger crowds you might need that \"UMPH\"!! I had a small Bluetooth speaker that I connected ( to my phone) for that extra \"boost\" and that was just great. I recommend this projector 100%.",

                "reviewText": "Ive had this product for over a year now and its never failed to be great for me and my fiance.This projector is super easy to set up and use, we usually keep a Roku plugged into one of the USB ports and an HDMI so anytime we turn on the projector the Roku powers up as well.Ill go over some of the main things I've noticed from this projector and be as honest as i can.The model i have is slightly older than the model being shown now, but i imagine not a ton has changed.Picture:This projector has good quality for its price. We had it set up so it displayed on a wall about 16 feet away and the quality is what you would expect from a projector. Its really only noticeable if youre close to the wall/screen. I will say the brightness is tough to see during the day, but thats with most projectors.Sound:This is a small projector, so it has small speakers. They dont have much bass, but in general for shows its done well. I would recommenrd some external speakers plugged in to really give it the kick it needs.Mounting:This projector cant be mounted unless you get creative. It does NOT have the \"standard\" projector mounting holes. That being said, if youre sitting it on a shelf or table, theres a screw/stand you can use to adjust the angle, which is useful. This projector does come with several options for displaying (upside down, flipped, etc..) for any way you could want it to project. We tied (with some paracord) ours to a projector mount that screwed into the ceiling and its stable enough to not wobble or fall and it imitates a 65in tv in our bedroom.To summarize, its a good projector. Its light and super portable, it had good quality and good speakers. If youre setting up an in-home theater this isnt for you. But for college students in a dorm or apartment, or really anybody not wanting to spend a bunch of money on a large TV that's hard to transport, this is a GREAT solution.Lastly i have to mention customer support. We lost the remote to ours during a move and getting up to turn it on/off, adjust volume. etc.. was horrible. I emailed Hompow customer service and after verifying my purchase they immediately sent me a replacement remote and they were delightful during the whole process. Supplying me with the tracking number for the package and following up to make sure I received it and it works.Trust me you skepitcal projector shopper, you cant go wrong with this one. Hompow is doing it right.",

Right from the unboxing on to the initial focus of the picture....quality and best of the best for the price. I could not believe how sharp the picture AND sound of this device was on the first use. Honest opinion...don't waste your money and time on searching for a better option for the price. I did my research and hesitated in disbelief, but I am very happy I made the purchase. The pictures are just from the ceiling alone, without a screen. Amazing!!! 10/10",
