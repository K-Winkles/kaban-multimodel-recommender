                "reviewText": "I love how great the quality of the image the projector provides as well as the ease of setup and use. The remote control is very simple and easy to use. You can also expand the parameter of the image as needed without too much distortion which comes in handy if you have a larger surface to watch.",

                "reviewText": "The projector itself is fine, but the Google TV software which is Hako Mini OS does not work in comparison to other streaming devices. YouTubeTV especially stutters and buffers constantly. I have a robust internet network with various streaming devices and no issues like this. I connected a Chromecast device to the projector HDMI input, and that works just fine for the image, but you can\u2019t connect an external speaker via Bluetooth via the HDMI port, which became a dealbreaker for me. If you want to use just the projector, that\u2019s fine, but any of the other bells and whistles aren\u2019t effective.",

I also want to add that having to reconnect the remote to the projector each time it is turned off is very annoying. I will likely be returning it.",

                "reviewText": "This little projector is an ALMOST perfect portable theater on the go. With an ANSI 200 Lumen brightness rating it's not the brightest but it comes with built in AndroidTV and any streaming app you would want. The handle on top makes it super cute and portable so you would expect to just be able to grab it and tether it to your mobile phone and play movies on a wall out behind your dorm. The one missing feature to make that dream a reality is the lack of a rechargeable battery built in. You can grab it and go but you better bring that 50' extension cord with you and find a plug nearby. So close to a really really cool grab and go projector.",
