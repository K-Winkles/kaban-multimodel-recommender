                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful versatile little projector that can be used for a number of video display functions. Next summer I will be using it in the yard to have family movie nights under the stars. I will be bringing it to my mother's 90th birthday party early next year so I can display her life in pictures at the party. I can also see it being used at ad hoc meetings to display powerpoint presentations. And of course you can use it to display epic movies on a big screen in the house. I think the screen I bought to hang up was $10. There are better screen options if you spend more money. The power cord is very thin. The remote requires 2 AAA batteries that aren't supplied. The internal speaker is not great, but it's easy to plug in an external one and get much better sound quality for those epic movies plus you can do bt audio. The picture quality is very good, but you need the room to be rather dim. The darker the room the better. There are many ways to connect a device to the projector like USB, HDMI and bluetooth. I tested the projector using an MP4 file on a USB drive and that worked well. I also connected my laptop to the projector with the supplied HDMI cable and that worked well too. I couldn't get my Android to connect to the projector via bluetooth, but I believe it's only for remote bt speakers, and my bt speakers worked really well. I connected the projector to my WiFi network, but didn't try screen casting/sharing my phone or tablet over the network. What would make this projector over the top would be to have it connect to a phone via bluetooth and display the phone's screen and in the media screen add a browser so that when you are connected to wifi you can bring up on-line video directly. But it's still a very worthwhile device especially for the price point it's at.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a small projector that was easy to set up for back yard movie nights.This does the job pretty well, but I definitely would not consider this a centerpiece of my home entertainment gear. It's good enough for the price and therefore I'm happy to use it for parties without too much concern about it getting knocked over.THE GOODIt's light weight and does the job. I plugged my Chromecast into the HDMI input and was up and running in minutes. Even in a light polluted environment projecting against an uneven gray wall, the image looked pretty good. It takes very little space, and the round rubber foot is grippy enough that I'm not worried about it slipping off a table from a mild jostle. Additionally, the automatic keystone correction (off by default) works well, making setup even easier. The built-in speaker is loud enough over the fan noise to enjoy a movie with basic audio, or you can run an aux cable to an external speaker for better stereo sound (tested, confirmed).THE BADThere's no lens cover.Connecting this to Wi-Fi was beyond difficult. You have to use the remote, which is clunky and slow to begin with. There is no \"&\" character, so my complex password was impossible. Once I switched to a simpler Wi-Fi network, saving the password was confusing\u2014you have to navigate past the top of the entry form, then it collapses and reveals a save button. Confusing.The automatic keystone correction is pretty good, but there's no manual adjustment option. You're stuck with whatever it decides to do.Once connected to Wi-Fi, I found it useless. I didn't recognize any of the streaming options, and the software update menu doesn't even work over the Internet. Just forget about Wi-Fi and instead plug in your Roku or Chromecast or whatever.The remote is REQUIRED. You cannot switch the input to HDMI without it. You cannot do anything at all without it execpt to power it on/off. It requires 2 AAA batteries which are not included.VERDICTOverall I'm happy. I just wish I hadn't wasted 30 minutes trying to use the built-in Wi-Fi. The only menu option I needed to set was the automatic keystone correction. In the end, it's a nice little projector, much easier to deal with for casual purposes than my full-size projector with all its adjustments and features.",
