Aimed it at the wall. It took a few seconds to warm up and then, even in broad daylight with no curtains, on pukey apartment tan/gray/green paint, there was vivid color and bright whites and a perfectly legible 9 foot playstation screen. This just feels magical. I adjusted the keystone to undo the distortion from the angle I had it at, played with the focus and zoom for a few seconds, and started playing some games. Even without extended game mode it was responsive enough to play some resogun, so I turned game mode on (not just the color setting, the low lag) to try it out. The keystone undoes, so my quick setup ran the top of the screen into the ceiling, but it was so smooth, so pretty, so big. Like I feel like a kid and this is magical watching black screens look like wall then in slides a logo or loading screen and then it's a game on my wall. Is it a little washed out in daytime? Yeah, the blacks aren't super deep around noon, but perfectly watchable even if you don't close the curtains, and your eyes adjust better than it can look in a photo to make the blacks look black next to the amazing whites. Is it amazing in the dark? Yes. Even after around 4pm with no curtains, when you don't even need a room light on yet, blacks look deep black next to the brights and everything is rich. Is it magical? Always. Is it good for gaming? Yes. I am very very impressed. Been gaming for decades and I never want to use a tv again, the brightness on this and the size make a rich deep picture with a wow factor even just on an off-color wall with no prep. I bought a sound system in expectation that the built in speaker would suck, but it's about on par with decent tv speakers and serviceable. Great volume actually, I have yet to turn it above 3. I got this to treat myself and holy **** it's amazing. Highly recommend. Just do it. It weighs so much less than a tv and is so magical. Great color and brightness and good for gaming and watching Netflix or whatever. I am so excited to play everything on this I feel like I just bought a second childhood. It has no business looking so good in the daytime.Considerations after a few weeks: use \"game\" or \"hdr sim\" in daytime, it blows out the whites but the contrast and brightness is so much better. The dynamic brightness is supposed to give you 15,000 hours of life, that's like 10 years of 4 hours a day, but you can hear the fan speed change, and the brightness ramp up can be noticeable and distracting when brightness changes on screen back and forth: not usually noticeable on games, but on some shows where dialogue cuts back and forth. If you want 240hz and atmos, good luck. You would need the right dual outputs on your pc to go straight to the projector and av receiver, as the projector only has stereo out, and I don't think there is an a receiver or splitter on the market that can do 1080p240hz, best I can get is 1080p120hz or 4k60hz, which is still exceptional. Those considerations said, I still highly recommend this, it's amazing.After a few months: still loving it. I think the only complaint is that on dynamic brightness the whites get crushed a bit on hdr from my PS4, this can probably be solved by switching to the non dynamic bright mode. On hdr in general, the dynamic black ramping will occasionally create banding and white blowout on transitions of dark to bright content too, the response time of the lamp and pixels seem to differ, this could probably be solved in a firmware update. Still highly recommend. It's a 4k60,1080p240hz projector with gaming speed and insanely good brightness and color. Nitpicking aside nothing compares to this. Pair with a surround or Atmos sound system and it's a perfect home theater.1 year update: still loving it and highly recommend it. I run my PC at 1080p120hz for movies upscaled with svp, and PS5 at 4k60. I stopped using HDR because the picture looks better without it, as it crushes whites and blacks on dynamic brightness mode. Overall the only downside is that around noon the picture is washed out, and you need to either pump the contrast up to about 30, or close the curtains. Best display I've ever used, don't even need game mode it's not laggy. Possibly the best purchase I've ever made.I eventually found the setting that was blowing out the whites in dynamic brightness mode, in the image settings screen scroll, to the second page and there's some trademark sounding color menu like tru color or vibrant color or something, it's basically a second contrast scaler. I still usually leave it on the default setting for the brightness boost for a clearer image with lights on, but if you're doing movie night with the lights off, setting it lower will give you a better reference image, which of course there's an image preset for anyway.",

                "reviewText": "Very happy with the UHD35 so far, coming from an old 1080p Wimius S1 projector. It is a night and day difference in terms of brightness and sharpness. 4K looks clear, colors are vibrant, blacks are decent, and it is BRIGHT.Not perfect though. There are some minor issues with purple fringing and blockiness in color gradations. I plan to keep mine for now. I think for ~$1000 (if you can still find it for that price), it\u2019s a decent performer and probably the lowest price for a 4K projector. Not expecting it perform like a $2K-$3K projector. I did consider the Epson 3080 and 4010 too, but those were more pricey.Good:- Bright picture (especially HDR highlights). Easily viewable during the daytime in ambient light.- 4K looks sharp. Definitely noticeable around text and edges compared to 1080p resolution.- Good color/contrast. Maybe slightly oversaturated out of the box but can be turned down in settings.- Low input lag for gaming. Tested on several XBO games and I do feel a difference from my LED TV.- Very quiet in ECO mode.- 3D capable and works great. Just re-watched Avatar in 3D and it looked fantastic. Need to buy DLP-Link 3D glasses.Not so Good:- No Lens shift and limited zoom range. 11ft distance will give you a ~100\u201d picture but you can only move it maybe +/- 1 ft until you hit the zoom limits. Also need to ensure the projector is centered and placed at the right height to get a square image. It does have digital keystone correction but I try to avoid using it.- Slight purple fringing / aberrations around white text. For me it\u2019s only noticeable if I get up close and actually looking for it. Some reports of this online as well. But during fast motion scenes you don\u2019t notice.- Some blockiness in areas of subtle color gradations. One Amazon review reported this as well, and we noticed it while watching some Pixar movies, but then other movies we did didn\u2019t notice at all. This is probably my main gripe with it. Some reports say adjusting the color space settings help, but I haven\u2019t fully tested yet.- Black levels could be better, but I think is acceptable for the price. Shadow details are nice and clear at least.- Fan is a bit noisy on the \u2018Bright\u2019 Setting. Still quieter than my old projector.- Remote feels laggy sometimes. You have point it just right at the projector.",

                "reviewText": "I am happy with the projector. The picture is clear even with the ambient light with no distraction. It's just like watching a big100inch TV. The reason for buying this is I don't have a separate room for projection to make it dark as I live in an apartment and during summer times it gets dark very late. Now I watch with out worrying about the ambient light.The picture quality is great with a little compromise on color accuracy due to its high lumens. The picture is more detailed due to its high contrast ratio and most of all I watch it in (eco. mode) where the fan's noise is absolutely quiet which I liked the most as my sitting position is right under the projector. It's easy to operate and the picture resolution gets adjusted automatically as per the source and this is another feature I liked it. I know I am coming there! Yes the gaming mode is quick and the input lag is barely noticeable. Played @1080p120hz the motion is smooth controlling with out blurring just like an instant action on screen. Now I am looking to purchase a PS5 once available and will update the performance after using it.Over all the picture is a decent 4K@60Hz with a pixel shift true 4k colors. The detailing in the picture is very good when watched from certain distance. It has deep blacks. It's a good projector and great alternative for a big TV.",

                "reviewText": "I grabbed this item from Amazon Warehouse used (it was brand new), so I saved a lot of money ($1200). I don't think the product would be worth it at full price. In my rookie opinion, it's quite loud, I ceiling mounted it and ended up setting it to \"Eco.\" Mode which is tolerable. \"Dynamic\" mode really washed out the image for me, especially in scenes with blue skies. \"Bright\" mode is okay but the noise level is too distracting so I don't use it.A couple of considerations I had not thought of; the airflow is through the sides of the unit so the light leakage is pretty significant (this thing is bright), currently in a room with white walls so it lights up the whole space... I might end up doing some painting, we'll see. The other surprise was that it doesn't support my receivers native resolution (pioneer vsx-935), not the end of the world but it means if I want to configure my receiver I have to connect another display to access its menu.*Have not tried any gaming and only usage is 4k 60Hz, using Netflix 4k source content. About 130\" but I also haven't added a screen (using white walls for now). Overall, fun experience.",
