It has great color, an app that can adjust for wall waviness if you don't have a screen where you are using it, amazing blacks and whites, and keeps up with gaming with no trouble. Would definitely recommend.We do have a screen, but we haven't put it up yet. We just haven't gotten around to it, and the projector looks so good even without it.To be fair, we do have a pretty great area for a projector. We don't have a dedicated theater room, but it is in a basement room with half windows covered with blackout curtains on either side. It works rather well.My only gripe is that the physical size of the projector is big enough that it was a bit of a hassle to hunt down a surface to sit it on. We ended up with a coffee table. I'm not in love with it, but it works. We do have some added difficulty due to having to find something rather low to the ground since the ceilings are only 8ft in the room it is in.",

                "reviewText": "You can find a lot of reviews on the web regarding this projector. My experience with it matches with those reviews, and you\u2019ll be able to find all the Pros of owning the projector in those write-ups. I\u2019ll list a few of the Cons or issues that I didn\u2019t see listed in most of those.- AndroidTv works fine, although it\u2019s not as refined as the Nvidia Shield. I actually wish they hadn\u2019t of included the OS because if feels a little incomplete or lacking in features. Hopefully they\u2019ll release an improved version soon. The projector will be a nice all-in-one streaming device If they fix some of the bugs and provide more functionality.- No Netflix support!!! \u2013 I suppose it could be added later, but it\u2019s irritating waiting for the OS to boot so you can switch hdmi inputs to use a full featured streaming device.- Lacks a default source option. It boots straight into AndroidTv, so each power up forces you to switch hdmi inputs when you prefer to use a third-party streaming device.- Built-in AndroidTv streaming HD can be flaky (spinning progress wheel) trying to buffer shows. This requires a reboot to fix. Although I haven't noticed it with firmware 1.02 yet.- HDMI-Arc CEC function is flaky and Arc doesn\u2019t stay linked. I have to constantly disable and reenable HDMI-Arc with each power up. It will stay linked if the receiver is never powered off.- Sound output options are limited and the selected option is flaky too, it occasionally defaults and has to be reset.- Square Alignment is possible, but very time consuming, because it's very sensitive to minor adjustments. It will take a solid hour if you want the squarest picture before using their phone app to auto correct the image (which works awesome and flawlessly). Although one small bump or minuscule movement will distort the image again. Start with the rear height foot first and don't adjust the Left\\Right keystone feet until the top\\bottom image is where you want it.- Manual focus ring is stiff and does not have a very \u2018exact\u2019 or precision spot on feel to it (kind of feels like a cheap plastic toy camera).- My unit locked up during a firmware update. The system downloaded the firmware and started the install. Then it rebooted with fans on hi with a steady blue power light (system ok indicator), but no image displayed and the OS wouldn't boot. After a few mins the unit will reboot with fans on hi, a steady blue power light and no image (it kept doing this). There were no devices or cables plugged into the unit at the time. Epson support was easy to work with and offered to replace with a new unit, but I wasn't sure I wanted a projector that has the potential to brick with a simple firmware update. I played around with hooking up a receiver to the HDMI2-Arc port to see if something might output. For whatever reason that allowed the projector to continue the firmware update. The power button started flashing blue for awhile and eventually restarted successfully.",

Other then that I couldn't get it to work nor could the nice lady on Epson support line. I turned on the projector and everything was fine at first. I got to Google home and I started to watch YouTube. I could not get it to focus. I spoke to Epson and they said the focus is in the positioning of the projector. There are no option. So strike one. I moved this thing every direction. I'm very tech savy and not slow at all. this thing is broke or it just a blurry image. The tech support lady told me to update the projector. I get a notification to update the projector. I'm like that's it. All it needs is an update problem solved. Nope! It completes and installs. Everything is going well, except the focus is still off. it really blurry. I'm using a CLR screen from elite screens. So there nothing wrong with my screen. After it restarts and complete the update. I get back to Google home again. I play YouTube and then it goes blank and the fans are going high speed and the light is flashing on and off. I figure maybe it's loading it something. It does that for next 30 minutes and it finally stops. No picture though. So I turn it off and power it back on. still no image. I call Epson back. They said to check my HDMI cords and they were good then they recommend to unplug it for 30 seconds. That did work. Oh except I have a message that says play back has been stopped for safety reasons. What safety reasons. This stupid thing thinks the air is a person? I got a bad batch. It works then it doesn't. Buy at your own risk.",

                "reviewText": "I had a normal bulb projector for 5 years now and it was finally time to upgrade to a UST. I\u2019m so glad I did, this thing works amazing! It\u2019s soooo much brighter than my old one! I can finally watch it during the day with the curtains open. I\u2019m pretty amazed by the brightness. It was super easy to set up, plug it in and you\u2019re good to go. I need to move my existing screen up because as all UST projectors, the image needs like 5-8\u201d of vertical space from the base of the projector to the bottom of the image. Something to keep in mind! Love the googletv interface too! Overall great projector!",

The interface is ugly and difficult to navigate. Did you want Netflix? You'll need to buy a Roku or something. Seriously what device doesn't support Netflix? When you DO get a Roku the HDMI port is wonky occasionally tossing up errors, requiring a power reboot of everything to get it working. I've tried many high end cables, same issue. I have a 65in OLED, it's vastly superior to this thing.",
