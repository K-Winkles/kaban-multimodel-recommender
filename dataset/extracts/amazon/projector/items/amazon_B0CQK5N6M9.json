This one is portable, great quality, and very user friendly, and most important it is not as expensive as XGIMI. It came in with a nice storage bag. I'm extremely pleased with the brightness of the screen even with moderate light in the room. You just simply place this projector within a few inches of the wall (no need to mount it on a ceiling) and after a few adjustments you are set to enjoy your content. I have been using it for several days and it works perfectly. Overall, very happy with the purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a great portable projector!",

From the perspective of portability, quality of materials, remote control, picture quality, and brightness, it seamlessly meets my requirements for a video projector. Within a realistic expectation, this is definitely a great projector to buy from Amazon as it offered me $50 off discount.The instruction in English version was clear. So far I have been using this device for multiple times and it still works perfectly with mirroring my iPhone, Laptop, and iPad. Totally worth every penny.The picture space size is adjustable using remote control so it fit in my bedroom. The picture quality is even better than the old television I\u2019ve been used. Super love this product which improves my quality of life!!",

This projector is also very simple to operate and can be connected to iphone or ipad\uff0cwhich is useful\u3002Even with my living room light on, I can still see the picture, although, I would recommend VERY minimal lighting. The speakers are ok. At maximum volume I'm able to hear it over my old fashion furnace. The picture size is perfect for no bigger than my living room is. I plan on buying one more for my bedroom at some point. The picture quality is better than any television I've ever seen.",

Its operation is very convenient, you only need to connect the power supply, connect HDMI to the computer and you can watch it. The 1080p definition is great, I put it in the living room and the image is very clear on the wall. The sound quality of the projector itself is good, and there is no need for additional speakers. If you have the pursuit of sound quality, you can also connect your favorite speakers. It also comes with a bag to put down the projector and various data cables. It is very convenient when going out camping, highly recommended!",

Bright enough to use during the day. Brightness is important to me and this projector didn't let me down. It seems brighter than my previous so-called \"800 lumens projector\".2. Projected images are pleasing to the eyes and texts are sharp.3. Varias connection options. Besides wifi and Bluetooth connections, there are also 2 HDMI ports available. I can have my pc and switch connected to it all the time.4. Easy keystone correction. One-step to operate and allows a large adjustment range.Cons:1. The power cord is short.2. The remote is directional, which means I have to point the remote to the project for remote control.",
