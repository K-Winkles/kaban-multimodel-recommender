                "reviewText": "I was looking for a large screen for an event. I didn\u2019t want to bring my old fast fold so I looked for one on Amazon. I wasn\u2019t sure how straight and wrinkle free this one would be. I also wanted to use this for rear projection in the future. I set up the screen and stand the night before. Pretty easy to set up stands and crossbar. Be careful and I would label the pieces so that you know how many are needed for crossbar and extensions on stands.The screen is pretty straight and wrinkle free once you velcro the sides to the stand. Keep in mind that the stand is not heavy duty and to be mindful of the plastic parts. For the price, this is excellent and the gig paid for this already. I would recommend this for home theatre, events, schools etc.",

Luckily it comes with sand bags, straps, and hooks. I bought a couple extra tent steaks, but you may not need to.Pro\u2019s1) way more tight than most reviews were saying (even at the bottom). Did not have a problem with it at all.2) picture was amazing on this! Now, I do have a high-midrange projector, so that helps,3) lightweight and easy to assemble!WOULD RECOMMEND!",

I bought this on the fly to set up in our garage as an alternative.This is very good for what it is, a portable, compact, lightweight, easy-to-assemble-and-disassemble screen. It's not a heavy duty screen, and you wouldn't expect that at this price point. But for something you're going to use either indoors or outdoors with minimal wind, you'll be in good shape.",
