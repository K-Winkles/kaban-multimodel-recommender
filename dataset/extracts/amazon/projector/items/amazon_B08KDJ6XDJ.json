                "reviewText": "For the price point I was hoping for the best but not expecting much greatness out of it. I am pleasantly surprised with the picture clarity, picture brightness, ease of use, and mostly the value you get. I was looking for an upgrade from my 3500 lumen projector and also wanted the versatility of using it with my 120\u201d indoor screen as well as my 20 foot inflatable outdoor screen. I am blown away with the all around quality of this item. This thing is ready to go right out of the box (which is a huge plus) it comes with a nice large light fabric screen with those 3M hanging hooks (nice surprise since I didn\u2019t remember seeing that when I ordered it, plus it\u2019s super easy to set up) it also comes with HDMI cord and audio cords. I\u2019m able to hook up my sound bar and subwoofer with great ease with the different audio cords included (the sound quality of the built in speakers are decent as well but obviously less superior than using with good external speakers). I can use just the built in speakers when I use outside without any problems, but external speakers have more depth in sound. The smart phone mirroring feature is cool (I tried it out with my iPhone) while not practical for what I use it for still pretty cool. FYI you can open streaming apps from your device in mirroring but once you try to play a show/movie it won\u2019t mirror through the projector (I think because of copywrite laws or something) but it\u2019s simple enough to just plug in a firestick to play anything you\u2019d like that way. The fan is also way quieter than expected, when turning on I have to double check it\u2019s warming up because how quiet it is. It also has an adjustable height/tilt screw on the bottom which I was able to take out and connect to a generic tripod (for when I use outside). One thing it doesn\u2019t have are mounting screw holes for a ceiling mount, there are probably attachments to remedy this but I always just use with my tripod so it doesn\u2019t bother me. The versatility of picture size is incredible, no matter how small or large your desired picture size is there aren\u2019t any discrepancies with the clarity of the picture that I\u2019ve noticed. As I mentioned before I use this with my 20 foot inflatable outdoor projector screen and you can get a much much larger picture size which is incredible. This is by far my favorite projector I\u2019ve ever purchased. When I first received this in the mail I did a quick set up inside to familiarize myself with it. While my other projector I have, the room has to be dang near pitch dark. This works just fine in any indoor light situation you come across. I can see the picture just fine in the middle of the day, window blinds open, and lights on. While the picture isn\u2019t as great it\u2019s still perfectly watchable.Pros: high quality/ easy to use/ lots of extras/ huge picture/ great clarity & brightness/ quiet fan/ own carrying-storage case/ decent built in speakers/ feels quite durable (not cheap)Cons: no ceiling mounts (I personally don\u2019t care about this, but it\u2019s just something to be aware of)/ so far I haven\u2019t found any other cons for which I use this for.",

                "reviewText": "For the price this projector is amazing. Very bright and clear. I love the auto focusing feature.It was easy to use the remote to correct the keystoning.There is some very light fan noise as others have mentioned, but it's what you would expect from a brighter projector since it needs to cool the lamp, etc. Not at all a distraction in my case.The ability to load apps for HBO Max, Disney+, Crunchyrole, and is a big plusThe only app we couldn't get working was Hulu, since it appears the version available is locked to Asia.I was pleasantly surprised that the remote worked without having to aim it at the unit (behind me).Overall a great little unit so far.",

                "reviewText": "Devent picture works well but the biggest problems with this thing is that every single time that I use this, the corner correction, auto focus, and keystone correction go back to the original setting and it's bigger than the entire wall in our bedroom which is about 140 in wide. I have to keep the auto focus off otherwise it just resets and zooms itself back out. On top of that there is no Hulu app for this projector which sucks. Third, trying to open Amazon prime app and no keyboard pops up! The app seems to be incompatible with the projector itself, the login page pops up but the remote does absolutely nothing! It does not move the selection bar, no keyboard pops up to type in any login information and you can't even move down to the continue button. So the prime ap itself opens no problem, but there's no way to actually log in!!!! I've tried everything including hooking up a keyboard and my laptop. The main point of getting this projector was to use Amazon prime and now instead I have to screen mirror through my phone! Plus, when screen mirroring through the phone, the cast app has such bad lag on it, the video is incredibly choppy. The projector itself works fine, it connects to our Verizon cable box beautifully via Wi-Fi, all the other apps work fine! Other than these 3 particular issues, this thing is great all though it is DEFINITELY not a 4k projector. Its 1080p. There's no 4K or UHD settings on this thing. Make sure you turn off the auto focus on this thing when using it unless you wanna reaet it every time. They need to fix the compatibility issue with the remote and the projector and the prime app though big time.",
