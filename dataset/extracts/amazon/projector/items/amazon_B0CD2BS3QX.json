                "reviewText": "Bought this for my son who is going off to college - he does have a TV but decided this may be better for easily bringing up a \"TV\" and removing it when not in use since the dorm room isn't huge. We tested it out in a small living room and it worked great! Displayed the laptop display just fine although, the audio didn't work but that was user error I'm sure. Just do your homework when setting this up and follow the instructions and you'll have a great time! The clarity is great and everything is legible. It can be used in a small space or a large space but you should at least have clear wall to work with.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a projector from another website that was cheaper and bad quality. This one is as advertised and true 1080p HD quality. I am able to connect my steam deck (needs hdmi / usb c adapter) and it is like having a big screen I can take anywhere. I has a USB port so that you can watch videos / pictures etc. from a USB drive, or with an adapter you can watch from an SD card (a great idea if you want to share family photos and videos on the go). I use it as an extension of my phone and gaming devices so I don't need to take a bulky monitor and a lot of extra cables with me.I wish that there was a dedicated SD Card reader on the device, and the battery compartment for the remote control was difficult to open. Otherwise this is an awesome projector at a great price!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased projector to watch sports and movies. Had to purchase a cable to hook it up to phone, Chromebook, or laptop. It is awesome! We purchased a 150 inch screen (you can also use a blank wall) and the picture is great and my family loves it! My son hooked up his PS5 as well. The large picture makes it feel like you are on field at a game or in the movie. Fun experience. We are able to use a separate blue tooth speaker to enhance the sound as well. Good purchase. Will gift more to family and friends.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the box the projector is small and quite portable. The tripod is tiny and cute but did not hold the projector when tilted all the way back.Picture quality is pretty good. No complaints there.It does not have wifi so if you want to stream from your phone you will need to connect it with a cable or a chrome cast.The sound is barely loud enough, even when sitting 5 feet away in a mostly quiet house. So external speakers are a must.Overall, it does what it says and I'm pretty happy with this little projector.",
