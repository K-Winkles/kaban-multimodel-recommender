                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have been using a WiMiUS projector for a while and everyone in my family loves its quality. One feature it lacks is auto focus and auto keystone correction. So, when I saw the latest projector from WiMiUS with those features and even better specifications for around the same price point, I purchased it and I am so glad I did because so far it has delivered everything it has promised. The projector arrived on time in a secure package and it comes with a nice carry-on bag. I have set it up in my media room and you can see its picture and sound quality from the pictures and video I have posted. Overall, it is a great product and I am very happy with the purchase.Pros:- The picture is so clear and bright even when the light is on!- The sound quality is very good for this price.- The setup is so easy and straightforward.- Connecting to the Wi-Fi was super easy and fast.- Whenever I turn the projector on or change its position, it auto-focuses which is amazing. If it doesn\u2019t get the right focus, you can easily set the focus just using the remote!- Keystone correction was perfect. You can setup the projector anywhere in the room and the picture will still fit the screen. I have not used the auto keystone correction yet.- The projector works really well with Amazon fire stick.- The settings to adjust the brightness, contrast, etc are very user friendly although the settings were perfect just out of the box.Cons:- I can\u2019t think of any for this price point.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I decided to buy a projector as an alternate to a secondary TV and got this option as one of Amazon's top seller. The delivery was super quick and the product build is of high quality. I have been using it for about 10 days now and the picture clarity is very impressive. It has a native 1080p display and supports upto 4k. I use a roku device to stream content and they automatically upscale to 4k on the projector with high quality. One of the best feature is the ability to autofocus and auto-adjust keystone. I have my projector project the image in a slant angle and the projector does a wonderful job of getting a 100\" rectangular image with good focus. The speakers are also of high quality and I barely noticed any sound distortion at high volume. Also, the projector light is bright enough that it can also be used during the day with the curtains on. Overall, the projector is a great alternative to a big TV at a fraction of the price.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with this projector! It's bright enough to watch during the day and the picture quality is good - not good enough to be used as a second monitor and read things clearly, but I wasn't expecting that (thought I'd try, though!). For movie use it's perfect. I have kind of an odd set up in a small-ish room, so it's up pretty high, tilted down at a rather small screen. Fortunately the zoom function gives a very wide range of projection sizes and the keystone allows me to get it square on the screen from a pretty awkward angle. That's exactly what I needed! It's not perfectly focused throughout the picture because of the fairly extreme keystone correction, but it's not so unfocused anywhere that you'd notice unless reading small text. Very impressive for the angle I'm using.The speaker is quite good for a built-in. The auto-focus works really well when projecting at a larger size, but struggles with all the corrections I'm using, but it's very easy to manually focus. The auto-keystone also works well up to a point that I've surpassed, but the manual keystone is also very easy to use. I've got a Chromecast attached; the Chromecast remote won't program to this unit but otherwise it works as expected.I love that it doesn't get hot at all and the fan is pretty quiet. All in all, a very good projector, exactly what I was hoping for.",

The image is a whole lot better than expected, it looked great on the wall! I had it stacked on a shelf but it also has the hardware to be screwed on the ceiling. It comes with a control so you can self adjust the screen and play with other settings. I love it! I can't wait to use to play super smash bros with my friends on it! Definitely reccomend if you wanna have a cute date night or a game night. It can also connect to Bluetooth speakers, though the sound on the projector itself is pretty good.",

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy and fantastic this projector is.First of all the projector displays movies in full HD, and it's like having a mini theater right in my living room. The colors are so vivid, and the image is super clear. I never realized how much detail I was missing out on with my old TV until I experienced the sharpness and clarity with the pictures this projector puts out, especially since the screen size is so much bigger.Setting it up was a piece of cake. I was worried it would be complicated, but it wasn't at all. I just plugged it in, connected my Fire TV stick with the HDMI cable (which was included, thank goodness!), and voila! Movie time! The remote control is straightforward, and the menu is easy to navigate. I didn't need to be a tech genius to figure it out.But what really impressed me is that I can use it for more than just movies. I connected my kids gaming console, and he had a blast playing his favorite games on the big screen. It felt like he was in the game! The projector supports different devices, so I can even connect my laptop.Now, I should mention that the built-in speakers are decent. They're good enough for everyday use, but if you want that real movie theater experience, I'd recommend hooking up some external speakers or a soundbar. I connected my old speakers, and the sound was fantastic!Overall, I'm thrilled with this projector. It has made my movie nights so much more enjoyable, and I feel like I'm getting more value out of my entertainment setup. If, like me, you're not a tech expert but still want an incredible movie experience, I highly recommend giving this Projector a try. It's been a game-changer for me, and I'm sure it'll be for you too!",

Este proyector LED Wimius Full HD 1080 con soporte 4k con wifi y Bluetooth es una muy buena opci\u00f3n si ten\u00e9is un presupuesto ajustado y quer\u00e9is conseguir una calidad de imagen m\u00e1s que buena. Los colores que proyecta son coloridos y potentes.Tiene un aspecto, acabado y dise\u00f1o muy buenos. Y adem\u00e1s, se integra muy bien en la decoraci\u00f3n del sal\u00f3n.Me gusta mucho simular mi propio cine en casa con \u00e9l. Cuanto m\u00e1s separas el proyector de la pared, m\u00e1s grande se ve la imagen, consiguiendo una pantalla muy grande, de hasta unas 300 pulgadas, aproximadamente.Lleva incorporado un altavoz que se oye bastante bien y adem\u00e1s tiene conectividad Bluetooth con la que puedes enlazar un altavoz o auriculares bluetooth. A m\u00ed me gusta poner un altavoz bluetooth debajo de la pantalla para que parezca que el sonido viene desde la parte frontal. Y si quer\u00e9is probar a ver una buena pel\u00edcula con este proyector y unos buenos cascos bluetooth, disfrutar\u00e9is a lo grande sin molestar a nadie.Adem\u00e1s, desde su puerto USB podemos ver sin necesidad de un ordenador:- Fotograf\u00edas.- Videos.- Documentos Word, PDF, PPT y Excel desde una memoria USB.Y mediante la conexi\u00f3n wifi, se puede duplicar la pantalla del tel\u00e9fono o tablet, ya sea con Android o con iOS.Tambi\u00e9n es posible enlazar un ordenador o cualquier dispositivo que se pueda conectar por cable HDMI porque tiene dos entradas HDMI. Como por ejemplo, un Fire TV stick de Amazon, un Chromecast o incluso la PS4.En cuanto a los ajustes, Wimius facilita muchas opciones.Puede elegir entre muchos idiomas para el men\u00fa. Entre ellos: espa\u00f1ol, ingl\u00e9s\u2026Tiene una rueda lateral al lado de la lente que permite enfocar f\u00e1cilmente la imagen. Adem\u00e1s, si entras en el men\u00fa, puedes ajustar el \u00e1ngulo de las cuatro esquinas y esto facilita mucho el poder colocar el proyector donde quieras.Tambi\u00e9n dispone de una funci\u00f3n zoom que permite disminuir la imagen a tu gusto hasta un 50%. A m\u00ed me va genial cuando quiero que la pantalla sea m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a o si no tengo espacio para separar el proyector de la pared.Con estos ajustes tienes la posibilidad de conseguir una gran calidad de proyecci\u00f3n en diferentes lugares.Yo lo tengo a unos 5 metros de distancia y funciona genial.Debo a\u00f1adir que tambi\u00e9n tiene una buena potencia de luz, por lo que no es necesario estar totalmente a oscuras para ver bien las pel\u00edculas. Yo lo utilizo por las tardes y no es necesario oscurecer mucho la sala.En verano lo utilizo como cine de verano en la terraza y mis hijos disfrutan mucho.Este proyector tiene un buen tama\u00f1o y pesa muy poco. Con la bolsa de transporte que se adjunta en la compra lo ten\u00e9is muy f\u00e1cil para llevar el proyector donde quer\u00e1is.Adem\u00e1s el proyector va acompa\u00f1ado de un mando, que va muy bien y es de f\u00e1cil manejo, un cable HDMI y un cable AV.Por su precio, es una muy buena elecci\u00f3n.",
