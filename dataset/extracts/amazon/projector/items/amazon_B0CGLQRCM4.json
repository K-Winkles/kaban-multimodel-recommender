            "[Auto Focus and Auto Keystone Correction] The Agreago projector with WiFi and Bluetooth features auto focus and auto keystone correction systems, making it a truly user-friendly projector. A clear and rectangular image can be obtained without repeatedly manually adjusting the wheel. Very easy to operate and set up. You will fall in love with the auto focus projector as soon as you use it.",
            "[1920*1080 Full HD and 400ANSI Lumens] The movie projector produces vibrant and sharp images due to its native 1080P resolution, 4K compatibility, and 400 ANSI lumens. The brightness, clarity, and color are much improved by German chips and Japanese digital imaging technology. There are almost no edge blurring and black spots on the projection. Your eyes are protected by the 6-layer high-refractive lens and diffuse reflection. Perfect for displaying photos, watching movies, and home decoration.",
            "[Latest WiFi 6 and 5.2 Two-way Bluetooth] This WiFi projector has a faster and stable wireless connection than other 5G projectors thanks to its industry-leading WiFi 6 feature. For better sound at events or outdoor activities, 5.2 dual-channel Bluetooth makes it simple to connect the projector to a Bluetooth speaker. You can also connect your phone to the projector via Bluetooth. The projector serves as a Bluetooth speaker. One video projector lets you have a double bonus.",
            "[Compatible with PowerPoint and Other Devices] Similar to teaching projectors, the home theater projector is able to read PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Text files directly from USB flash drives. Can be used for charity education, small-group lessons, and conferences. The portable projector is compatible with well-known gadgets including iPhone/Android phones, laptops, tablets, TV sticks, USB drives, DVD players, external speakers, etc. via HDMI/USB/AV/Audio connectors.",
            "[Louder Speakers and 300'' Large Screen Usage] Upgraded stereo sound cavity built-in. Without an additional speaker, you can enjoy a more dulcet and stronger sound, which is also the reason why the projector itself can be used as a Bluetooth speaker. The outdoor projector comes with a 100\" folding screen that can be used anywhere you like, yard, garden, garage, RV, and camping. Other novel projections include workout videos, online lessons, painting, sewing, and Halloween/Christmas decorations."

                "reviewText": "Just got this projector and I was easily able to connect it to my laptop with the HDMI cable (which was provided) to watch high quality videos on. The remote was pretty simple to use. It only needed 2 double A batteries (not included). Fortunately I had some batteries lying around my apartment. The image was clear, the sound was pretty good, it came with an aux cable, power cord, HDMI connector, and it even came with a big white screen that I could install in my apartment if I wanted to. Maybe I'll do that later lol.I also liked that it had the option to connect the projector via iOS, Android, amongst a variety of different ways. Unfortunately, I had trouble connecting it to my phones, but I read on the manual after that certain services like Amazon, and Netflix didn't prohibited screensharing with these devices. Fortunately, an HDMI cable (as I mentioned earlier) is a great work around this.I think it will be cool camping trips, and for random movie nights. Overall, this is a solid projector and I'm really happy with it. I hope this helps and thanks for reading.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: Nice little projector, really decent focus options as well! I\u2019m actually pretty impressed with this projector and have used it to trace art murals, and other fun things. The auto focus is an awesome feature, and I love that this has a remote for all controls as well. My only single issue, is about the third time I used it, the lens would not go back into the unit or even change focus. I finally got it to work with a tiny nudge. But just keep that in mind, you may want to go more professional with you projector choice if this is something you are going to be using often! \ud83c\udf9e \ud83c\udf7f",
