                "reviewText": "Very satisfied with this purchase. I tested this against another projector I purchased at a significantly higher price point, with more features (with native 1080p), and decided to keep this one as I didn't see much difference in image quality, and this one had the basic features I needed. Add to that, THIS projector actually has color/brightness/contrast adjustment features that the other (much higher priced) projector did not.The image is resolute, and although I noticed soft focusing near the edges, I didn't find that to interfere with the movie watching experience at all. Sure, it's relatively spartan in terms of features when compared to more expensive projectors (e.g. 4D keystone adjustment, wifi, bluetooth), but I wasn't much concerned with any of that as this one works just fine with the Apple TV plugged in via HDMI.You will definitely need blackout curtains (or a very darkened setting) if you want to use this during the daytime, but at night , it's perfectly suitable as a crowd-pleaser--as it's received praise for it's image quality and playback performance, both outdoors and indoors (used with a 100\" screen).I used a desktop speaker system(with subwoofer) via the 3.5mm jack (and a 15-foot 3.5mm audio cable purchased on Amazon) and the sound quality was great.I did use this with an iPhone 11 (with the Lightning to Digital AV Adapter, sold on Amazon) and although it worked relatively fine, I did notice some glitchy playback using the Amazon Prime Video App-- i attributed the glitchiness to the movie buffering, because the issue became less noticeable as the 90-minute movie reached about the halfway point. I have not tried the iPhone with any other video playback app or saved movies,, but I imagine it wouldn't be as glitchy if it were playing movie content directly stored on the iPhone device. I've used the iPhone for photos and personal video playback and playback was smooth and resolute.AUDIO TIP FOR APPLE T.V USE.: when first playing from the Apple TV, there was no sound emitted on playback, and after researching the issue, had determined that the sound is resolved by changing the audio settings on the Apple TV device from Dolby Surround to > Stereo as this projector does not support Dolby Surround.(Apple TV Settings > Audio & Video > Dolby Digital (set to 'OFF') )As a household, we've enjoyed several movie-watching experiences on this XIAOYA projector so far, and look forward to enjoying many more. For an entry-level projector with basic features, this one's a sure contender.",

                "reviewText": "Surprising quality from an inexpensive projector. While you can't expect the performance of projectors costing five, ten, or more times the price of this one, you definietly get more than your money's worth. Best performance is, of course, in a completely darkened room - even a little stray ambent light will wash out the projected picture a little bit, but the visual rewards are abundant when viewing movies, pictures, and other videos in a properly dark room with this projector. Its true native 720p image is crisp and colorful, even at projection distances of 8\"-10\". The built-in speakers provide quite good quality sound for a portable unit. The controls on the player are easy to use, as is the focus and keystone adjustments. It has a very nice, complete set of inputs as well : USB, SD card (full size slot), 2xHDMI, and composite video and stereo audio. The built-in media player - for showing pictures, videos, and playing music from your USB and SD devices - is up to the task, but you may find the media player on your Bluray DVD player or TV outputs better quality images. The projector accepts video sources up to 1080p, though it will display those programs at the projector's native 720p ... but you won't be disappointed at what you see. The remote control is tiny and a little hard to get used to, but works well. The physical build quality is also surprising for the price : the case seems quite solid, well designed, no rattles, bends, twists, or other annoyances, and it's got a high-class look-and-feel to it as well. Overall, at the price point offered, you'd be very hard pressed to do better than this projector.",

                "reviewText": "First. The good news. It works really well and when it works, it's very easy to set up. Depending on if I can work around a few issues, I'm going to try and set up a big. Movie night eventually.The first star is just it's incompatibility with my computer. I have tried two versions of these projectors, the first I sent back because it didn't seem to want to recognize my computer (MSI leopard running up to date Windows). The second, still didn't recognize my computer, but would recognize my old ps4, which is fine for now. My suspicion is that it's a driver problem.The second star is lost from its general brokenness. Neither remote worked with their projectors. Fortunately this version has controls on the top. I've also had problems navigatng to the USB option on the menu, which seems to be a UX issue. Maybe if my remote worked it would be easier, but I'm not convinced.The picture is pretty good. I'm watching, on my wall with the projector set maybe 10' back and there's zero distortion and it's a crisp image. You loose a little information in the blacks, but I haven't had a chance to really crack open the image settings yet and I expect that's an easy fix. Also, hook up external sound (but this is obvious).The brightness is. I mean it's a projector under $500. As soon as the sun is down, its fantastic, but it's not what you want for game day or marathon ing Lost when you have the flu.Tldr: it's cheap. You're not going to get $1000 quality from it, but if you need something inexpensive for night viewing. It works fine. May not work with your laptop.",
