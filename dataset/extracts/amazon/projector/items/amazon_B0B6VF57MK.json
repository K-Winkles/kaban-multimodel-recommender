Why is there no sound when I play videos via Chromecast, Roku, or Fire TV stick on my projector? Please go to the Sound Settings of your TV stick and select Auto Detect or PCM. After setting, the projector will be able to decode the audio from the stick. How to avoid audio lag when using Bluetooth? In order to get rid of the lag, we suggest you mirror your device to the projector via a wired connection. Additionally, please move your Bluetooth device closer to the projector in order to minimize interference in the environment. Why is my projector out of focus and blurry? Please adjust the focus ring and keystone ring to try to optimize image quality. Try to adjust the projection size from 60\" to 120\" based on the distance between the projector and the screen. Why is there no response when I use the remote control? The remote control does not come with batteries, so please prepare two AAA batteries on your own and install them into the remote. Point the remote at the IR receiver on the back of the projector.",

As so many venues don't have their own setup, I bought this to basically always have my own, portable option. And I have to say, it is everything it's advertised to be: small and lightweight, easy to use, great functionality, and really great picture!Even using it on darker walls or surfaces not mean for projection (see my video), it's nice and bright and clear. Plus, the carrying case, tripod, and remote is an extra bonus. So I highly recommend this projector, especially for it's price. It's a great deal!",

It fits easily in my backpack with everything else. It will work well for traveling, and my son watched a movie on it last week, and the picture was responsive and quick and the contrast and brightness made it enjoyable to watch.The picture quality is amazing: crisp, responsive, bright, great contrast. It works best on a projector screen, but even on a bumpy wall, people can read even the smallest words from the back of the room.It comes with a stand, which is a nice addition I\u2019ve not had with other projectors. It makes it so easy to adjust where the picture is on the wall or screen.The projector is quiet, which is so nice and unexpected based on my experience with other projectors. It also stays cool so I haven\u2019t worried about it overheating or anything, but I\u2019ve not used it for more than a couple hours at a time.The remote works well. You do have to provide your own AAA batteries. I\u2019ve not used the wifi or anything other than the included hdmi cord, but hdmi worked perfectly well and the cord seems like good quality.I was a little worried this would be a cheap knock-off at the price I got it for, but I\u2019m really impressed and will probably get another one for our other office.",

I wasn\u2019t able to connect my screen mirror through my iPhone to it which was unfortunate, but I\u2019m buying a fire stick for it anyway. Hooking it through a computer works great for now.

To get the best picture quality, you should position the projector at a 90-degree angle (zero keystone correction) to the screen. That's why I mounted it to the ceiling. It provides acceptable use during the day with the curtains closed. This projector works well with the Amazon fire stick. The speakers aren't very good, but it doesn't matter as I get a good sound with a Bluetooth headset. The remote control is simple but usable. My children also loved the product. Highly recommend this projector.Will probably upgrade to a better screen at some point but overall great quality for the price",

At the time of ordering, the price was $89.99. This is a decent value for the projector you are receiving.This is not a TV replacement, by any stretch. It is also not home theatre quality. With that said, this is a great budget projector to use when you would like to project a movie or video, play a video game console, or watch something from a USB drive. This projector does not perform well with text, so using it for Word, Excel, or PowerPoint is not advised.The specifications on the seller's description differ from the specifications of this unit. The seller claims that this is 1080P, while that may be true by being able to play from 1080P sources, the included manual states that the resolution is 1920x720. This is 720P, not 1080P. Although, this is still considered HD, it is low-end HD. If this is not a concern, then it is what it is.This projector comes well packed in a box that could be used for storing the unit when not in use, or to take with you. Inside the box is the projector, lens cap, HDMI cable, mini tripod, remote (2AAA batteries not included), cleaning kit, manuals, and power cable.The quality does match the price point, so the value is present. This projector is under $100, therefore it is considered an entry point, low end projector. If you are not sure about a projector, or how it could fit in your mix, this might be a great starter option.One thing I noticed after testing and I was writing up the review, the ASIN on the reviewed version is B0BKL51JQ5 and the page displays a different model all together, complete with a carry bag. I did not receive a bag. It also says it is 9000 lumens, my version is 7500 lumens. The ASIN linked to this now is B0B6VF57MK.-- BUYER BEWARE. --This is a different projector than what I was sent. It is also more expensive.All-in-all, good entry level. Excellent price point. Make sure the specs match up with the unit you are ordering. I am a little disappointed that this review is not being posted to the correct product.In the event that experiences change or evolve, updates may be made to this review to address such developments.",
