Why is there no sound when I play videos via Chromecast, Roku, or Fire TV stick on my projector? Please go to the Sound Settings of your TV stick and select Auto Detect or PCM. After setting, the projector will be able to decode the audio from the stick. How to avoid audio lag when using Bluetooth? In order to get rid of the lag, we suggest you mirror your device to the projector via a wired connection. Additionally, please move your Bluetooth device closer to the projector in order to minimize interference in the environment. Why is my projector out of focus and blurry? Please adjust the focus ring and keystone ring to try to optimize image quality. Try to adjust the projection size from 60\" to 120\" based on the distance between the projector and the screen. Why is there no response when I use the remote control? The remote control does not come with batteries, so please prepare two AAA batteries on your own and install them into the remote.

                "reviewText": "After long deliberation and doing my fair share of research, I finally made the decision to purchase the ADEPTICO Projector. To say that I am thrilled with my choice would be an understatement; this projector is truly a superior blend of quality, functionality, convenience, and affordability.The very first thing that took me by surprise was the show-stopping picture quality. The high-resolution display projects beautifully sharp and detailed images, whether I'm watching a movie, streaming a TV show, or conducting a professional presentation. The color reproduction is genuinely faithful, while the contrast ratio lends a spectacular depth to the visuals. This makes every viewing experience utterly immersive, something that anybody would welcome.What set the ADEPTICO Projector apart for me was its comprehensive range of connectivity options. From HDMI, USB to even wireless streaming, I've found it remarkably easy to connect various devices such as my laptop, gaming console, and certainly my smartphone. Such versatility ensures that the projector satisfies my need for entertainment and work, streaming content smoothly or turning my room into a gaming sanctuary.The projector's ease of setup was another welcoming aspect. Adjusting the focus and screen placement on the wall was a breeze. I was able to stream content from my smartphone within minutes, elevating my viewing experience to a whole new level. Its lightweight nature along with the compact carrying bag adds a dose of portability rarely seen in the projector market; whether it's for an impromptu backyard movie night or playing videos in an unconventional setting, this projector is well-equipped to handle it all.The built-in speakers were another pleasant surprise. Much louder than expected, they deliver solid audio output, although pairing them with dedicated Bluetooth speakers would undoubtedly enhance the experience. Despite being robust, the gentle hum of the fan isn't too distracting, which is a testament to the superior design of the ADEPTICO Projector.Certainly, I did face a small hurdle while trying to connect the projector with my smartphone initially. But after some to-and-fro between resetting settings and the router, it was paired perfectly, delivering seamless performance.So, if you're looking for a versatile projector that combines spectacular image quality, user-friendly operation, multiple connectivity options, and a lightweight design at a reasonable price point, look no further than the ADEPTICO Projector. I am absolutely delighted with my purchase, and look forward to the many movie nights, gaming sessions, and presentations ahead!",

This is a real portable project. There are so many \u201cportable outdoor projectors\u201d on the market, but many are too heavy to take them outdoors. This product is none of them\u2014a truly portable projector. Overall, this projector is worth the price.However, I decided to return it because the video in the center was clear, but the edge of the video was somewhat blurry. Besides, there was a light leaking, and it kept distracting me. On top of that, the sound was buzzing, especially bass. In addition, I could hear its fan noise. It was not too loud, but it kept me from concentrating on movies.Update: After the return, I received a message from the seller that the seller offered a full refund or an exchange. I am satisfied with the customer service even though I didn\u2019t accept the suggestion because I\u2019ve already returned the item and got fully refunded from Amazon. So I change it from 3 stars to 4 stars.",
