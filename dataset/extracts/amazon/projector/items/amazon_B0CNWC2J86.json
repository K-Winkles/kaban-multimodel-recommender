Came across this projector with positive YouTuber review and decided to give it a try.This projector was very easy to install and set up. We were very impressed with its image quality. The only downside was the noice from cooling fan. Can be noticeable when turned on, but once it started playing movie/show, it was ok. I think as long as it\u2019s placed further from sofa then it\u2019s ok.I would recommend to anyone who plan to set up home theater. Having a large screen to watch movie with family is super fun.",

It uses the LED technology so it performs well even in rooms with some light leakage when the shades are closed (see the attached images). I am projecting onto a closed window shade for a large window in my bedroom.The keystone function works well as long as all of the projector feet are on a flat surface. The controls allow adjustment of angle and offset and I was able to achieve a rectangular picture even though I set up the projector to the bottom right of the center of the screen. The zoom feature allowed me to install the projector in an ideal location across the room so I scaled it down from there a bit.I used it with my Nvidia Shield TV device over HDMI to get all the content apps and it works well. Everything is HD quality. Bluetooth audio works well with Sony WH headphones.",

WOW was I surprised! the quality of the picture and color was obvious right from the start up screen. I honestly did not expect much of a difference and was completely surprised. although I have been happy with the older one, this new one will be my go to projector. I took videos to compare the two. the first one is the older one in the evening. the second one is the updated model during the day. I would definitely recommend buying this one if your looking for a projector. side note, I have had to contact yaber a few times in the past, just with some general questions. They have great customer service and have always responded within 24 hours. I wish all companies were as easy to work with.",

                "reviewText": "We already have an older model Yaber projector and have had it for a few years and decided to upgrade to this unit. We already had a 5 star opinion of the original model and this one so surpassed it that I would give ten stars if I could.This unit, besides looking sleeker, cleaner, and more modern (it kinda looks like the head off that AI robot from the old Portal Games), it is also significantly quieter (the other one's fan was MUCH louder) and atleast twice as bright. In fact, unlike older models, this one is so bright that it is easy to forget that you are looking at a projection at all and not a new LED television. In fact, we project against a white painted plywood wall and it is so bright you cannot even tell that there is a texture of grain to the wall at all. It literally looks like a top quality television, except so enormous that you could never get such a big screen without shelling-out atleast twice as much as this unit costs, if not more. It literally fills our whole wall!Further, this unit was very easy to set-up and use, the menu was easier to navigate than previous models and our small children have no difficultly getting it running to toss in a movie for nap time or for our family evening sit-downs.Perhaps the most pleasant surprise of the whole package is all the EXTRAS it came with! It came with an extra HDMI cord, an extra AV cable, an awesome full-size back-pack style carrying case, a cleaning kit, and a cool lense cover.Its also very sustainable, we live off of solar panels for our electricity and so we have to be very diligent in keeping track of our usage and the draw of electronics on our system, and I can say that this thing can run all day without killing our electric supply. Such can't be said about most other electronics.Very pleased with the unit, it makes our family movie nights complete and we haven't even begun to explore all the extra features, such as using it with our phones etc.The picture i've attached shows the unit I am reviewing (white) here on top of our Xbox One and below the older Yaber unit (black) we've have for several years.The other picture is the display on the wall which is almost 20 feet away, on rough plywood that had been given a coat of white paint (all the seams and textures are still there), and in the middle of the DAY (when projectors work the least)!!!! So, this is the absolute worst projecting conditions for a clear screen, and as you can see, its awesome!!! Not to mention that the size of that projected image of the menu is around10 feet by 10 feet is size!!!",

Auto focusing and side casting can also be very clear. I really recommend that if the lighting is not very good, there is basically no need to close the curtain during the day, with low noise and good heat dissipation.",

The picture is very sharp and bright. It could be easily connected with HDMI input and you can connect it to your choice of speaker system using aux cable. Yaber has smooth integration with chromecast for you to be able to use single remote.",
