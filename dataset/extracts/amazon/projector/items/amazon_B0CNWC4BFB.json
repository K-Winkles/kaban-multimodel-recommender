                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Budget Friendly, Quality Projector",
                "reviewText": "Yaber is a brand that makes affordable, yet quality projectors. This is my second Yaber projector, with the first being the V7 about two years ago.Aesthetics:The projector looks nice and modern with a leather type texture on the outside plastic. It comes with a sleek lens cover that is easy to remove and reinstall, which is nice as some projectors you have to fight with the lens cover.Mounting:This projector has a single post mounting point, so if you are looking for a mount, you can look up \"Portable Projector Mount\" and this should bring up what you need. I do prefer the 4 point mount, however, this projector is light weight and the single mount point should be fine.Picture: The picture is super crisp and clear and sports a multi demension keystone correction. The projector will need to be flat or projecting slightly upward, as the focus gets all messed up if you try projecting downward (Mount it upside down and change image direction instead!).Colors: The colors on this projector are better than most in this price range. Deep blacks help the colors pop.Brightness: I can say that the brightness of this projector is superb for the price point. I have reviewed many projectors and this easily has the best brightness of any in this price range. It certainly is not a BenQ, but considering such projectors are thousands of dollars, it's pretty dang good!Dust Note: All projectors in this price range use a color-filter display that works by shining a full-spectrum LED through a filter assembly. The assembly has 4 filtering layers; blue, red, green, and black. They each technically have a small little filter for each pixel, all switching on an off rapidly. For this reason, they get hot. Because they get hot, they need to be cooled. This is done with a cooling fan and air routing inside the projector. Unfortunately, if you live in an area with a high amount of dust, this will end up building up on the filter assembly. I live in Phoenix, AZ and it usually has a line down the edge of the screen within 6 months, however, I have not had that much time with this projector so I can not say that for sure yet! My next category is cleaning, which makes up for anything that may happen here.Cleaning:The YABER projector is the only one in this price range, using filter display assemblies, that makes cleaning the display assembly easy. They provide you with several long q-tips in a bag along with a microfiber cloth. On the back of the projector there is a little filter door that pops off so you can look in and even stick the q-tip in (After dipping in alcohol) and clean off any dust build up. There is also a door you can open on the bottom to give you direct access to the display assembly. There is not much that can be done to stop dust from building up with these types of units, so it is awesome to see that Yaber thought ahead. Another thing you can do to help with this is remove the panel they have on the projector for the air intake. It has a little black screen on the inside. You can cut out a piece of filter material (HEPA) and replace it with that and you will have much better results with dust!This projector is perfect for presentations, movie nights, or watching sports. It is also low power, so you don't have to worry about it driving up your energy bill!Overall, very good find and will continue using Yaber in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I'm coming from a Yaber Y30 and this is a fantastic upgrade. The form factor is smaller, which is a plus if you're looking to conserve space, or just want a projector that's more portable. In the case of the latter, the projector comes with a nice backpack to hold itself, the remote, and all the cables you could possibly need.The good:\u2022Projector has 1 HDMI, 1 AV, and 2 USB ports.\u2022Vents and fans are on the sides making it much easier to clean.\u2022The inside lens is completely encased, ensuring dust doesn't show up on the backside of the lens, something I struggled with on the Y30.\u2022Picture quality is greatly improved over the Y30.\u2022Myriad options for tweaking color/contrast/brightness, etc.\u2022It has wifi and bluetooth connectivity.\u2022It's quieter than the Y30.The bad:\u2022Focusing the projector is a task. It has your normal focus ring and an x-axis adjust and I'm still tweaking the focus to get it just right. IE, the top left side and center is focused but top right is fuzzy. If I get the top right to focus, the left will become blurry. X-axis adjust is VERY sensitive which may be part of my problem, and most likely user error and NOT The fault of the projector.\u2022The projector came with firmware dating back to 4/2022 which provided very stunted picture quality options. Presets were way too yellow or red, and manual adjustments were not available. Connecting to wifi and checking for updates, the projector reported I was up to date, but after an email with support, I discovered there was an 8/2022 update and I had to install it manually. Would have loved to take an OTA update instead.\u2022If/when updating, your flash drive MUST be FAT32 formatted, otherwise the projector won't update. Getting the projector to recognize the update file is a bit of trial and error.Overall, I'm really impressed with this projector and it has taken the place of my Y30. Being able to project at a higher resolution makes watching movies much more enjoyable, and I'm really liking the fact that there's less cleaning/maintenance required to maintain a clean picture. Customer Support is fantastic and they'll work with you to ensure any problem you have is resolved. This is a great projector and you can't go wrong!",
