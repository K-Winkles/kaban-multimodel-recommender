I eventually found this one and ordered it right away. My sister loved it. She connected a chromecast onto and can cast anything from her phone to it.Things I like about it:-Native 1080p (some companies list projector as 1080p supported meaning that it can take 1080p input but won't output at 1080p)-Comes with a tripod. I don't use it because it's small as you can see in the top left corner of the pictures I included. I used an old camera tripod and it was compatible with the mount.-includes two cables, HDMI & RCA cable- has cleaning utensils- a remote ( i forgot to include it in the photos but there is one included n-Has a HDMI port, USB port, av port, and a Headphone 3.5m AUX port",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace an old projector my wife had for art sketching. You would have to put a photo in and it would project horizontally on the wall. Problem is the room needed to be dark and she had to draw in an uncomfortable position with her canvas or sketchpad taped to the wall. It's bright enough that she can sketch and paint at the dining table on a sunny day. The tripod mount on this is a huge bonus and you can flip the image around to project down to a table surface. The input options allow you to connect your laptop via HDMI. The USB input lets her put photos on a USB stick to project. I believe you can connect your Amazon firestick to it to watch movies theatre style projecting to a portable screen or a big white wall though I haven't tried that yet. So far we are very happy with this projector.",
