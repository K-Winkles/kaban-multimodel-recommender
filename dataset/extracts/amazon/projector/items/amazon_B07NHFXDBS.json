I do recommend using a Bluetooth speaker in addition to the one built into the projector because the speaker is not very loud, and the fan is a little louder than I\u2019d hoped, but the price on this unit to me is well worth it, just so happy to finally view my DVD\u2019s in my room and whenever I want to ( I rent a room and there just isn\u2019t space for tv and all that). It\u2019s a nice small projector yet it projects a fairly large screen onto my wall. I\u2019m so impressed with it, and very pleased with my purchase.",

So I was looking for a small, lightweight projector that had a DVD player instead of Hulu or Amazon. They\u2019re hard to find! But this has been great! We\u2019ve already had many family nights around the fire Watching movies under the stars.The sound is a little weak, so I suggest hooking it up to a Bluetooth speaker. It\u2019s super easy to set up. Grab a movie, extension cord, a Speaker, blankets, a pillow and get settled in.I still can\u2019t get the clarity perfect, either the words are slightly blurry or the picture is, but it does the job and I\u2019m happy with it",

Jo matter what I try it won't turn on I followed all the instructions on troubleshooting but it still won't turn on. Very disappointed I spent a lot of money on this for nothing. It's perfect for what I wanted it just won't turn on.",
