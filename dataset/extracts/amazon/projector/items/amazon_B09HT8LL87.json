For Android: Please purchase additional adapters: Dongle HDMI or Type-C to HDMI cable. For iOS: Please purchase additional adapters: Dongle HDMI or Apple Lightning to HDMI Cable. 2. Why can't I play Netflix/Amazon Prime/Disney videos? Some streaming videos or shows (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney) are protected by copyright and are therefore protected. You can connect the projector to your laptop to play the video or use your Fire Stick to enjoy the video. 3. Why is there no sound when playing videos? The projector does not support Dolby Audio. If there is no sound in the video, please check if Dolby Audio is turned off or switched to surround sound. 4. Why is it not recognized when I insert a USB stick? The Mini Projector supports USB2.0 (black) USB flash drives (up to 64GB), please check the file system format of the USB flash drive on your computer. The projector supports USB flash drives with \"NTFS\" and \"FAT32\" system file formats but does not support \"exFAT\". 5. Does the Mini Projector need to be connected to a power source at all times in order to work? The Mini Projector does not require batteries and must always be connected to a power source to function properly. 6. When connecting the Firestick, can I connect the power side of the Firestick to the projector at the same time? AKIYO's mini projectors have enough distance between the HDMI and USB ports to connect both the TV Stick and the TV Stick's power supply at the same time. Other projectors require the USB power supply of the TV Stick to be plugged into another socket when the TV Stick is plugged in.",

                "reviewText": "I use this Akiyo mini to project my digital inks onto paper so i can ink over it traditionally. Saves me hours of work. I've ordered projectors in the past to do this and none of them were as good as this little dude!!It's small & lightweight, (see picture for scale reference, I didnt have a banana handy, comes well packaged and cared for, the display is clear, the projected image is clear and bright, the interface is pleasant and straightforward. Focusing is easy and I have it mounted to an arm on my desk to face straight down. i also feel pretty safe with the 2 year warranty, thats more than most companies give for way more expensive items.Since I use it for inking, I have not watched anything on it but i did have something accidentally play while screensharing and found that the speakers are quite loud even at the default set to 50% percent.I am pleased with all the connection possibilities, but HDMI is the easiest. I had to get an HDMI to Usb-c adapter because my of my laptop limitations. The remote is nice too, because it sucks trying to control buttons with a device thats upside down.Only negative I have is that the fan is quite loud but i dont notice it after a while.I'll update this review should something unfortunate come to light (no pun intended).",

I can connect it to my wifi and cast from my laptop, and i can cast from my phone directly using smartview on Android, it also can cast from an iPhone, its 1080p, it looks good, I have it like 12 ft away from wall to wall and it looks clear and colorful, of course it has to be used in the dark, with the lights on is barely visible. I like that it has a section on the menu with instructions on how to connect your devices, the tripod is a good quality one and the remote control can let you browse the menu and turn up and down the volume. it has to be connected to 2.4 ghz wifi signal. the sound is perfect for a room but it also can be connected to a Bluetooth speaker for external sound! for the price is perfect! it has all the basic features to have a nice experience you can adjust the lens, tilt it up and down and resize the image from 75% to a hundred. im using it on 75% and the display is like 120 inches! keep it close to whatever you're using to display it and it will look good! check my pics and videos!",

However could not connect to WiFi as advertised, and also won't connect to Bluetooth or hotspot. This was also after I triple checked the WiFi password was correct, reset the wifi router, and tried to connect it to phone hotspot. It would still be worth the money maybe if it had a way to connect to devices with a cord but that won't even work because no such cord is provided, only an HDMI adapter. Would not recommend, you're better off spending more money on a common brand and not these cheap ones.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It\u2019s a nice projector. Little, inexpensive, but pretty powerful! One photo shows what it looks like when the lights are on, it\u2019s not super bright, but you can still see it. Lights off, it\u2019s very bright. Picture quality is pretty good for a $45 projector. Mine came with a tripod, which was very helpful for setting it up. It has multiple options for orientation/mirroring in case you mount this the ceiling or if you project through a mirror. Sound is pretty good, but if you\u2019re picky about sound quality, I\u2019d just go ahead and buy a wired speaker. The built in speakers arent super powerful.One small issue: if you have a newer Mac book or Windows device that only takes USB-C, you might have some issues. My newer Mac that needed an adapter for the HDMI cable didn\u2019t connect, but my older Mac that can directly take an HDMI cord worked! As did my Xbox. However, my Switch did not work. Again, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because it doesnt directly take an HDMI cable, only through it\u2019s port. Just be mindful when purchasing.",

I'll be using this for impromptu movie nights on the bedroom wall (100in screen size from 10ft).Set this up in my bedroom for impromptu movie nights with my partner and/or my children. At about 10 feet this projector will put up an approximately 100 inch screen (diagonal) at 1080p resolution. I did not use the onboard speaker as I connected to a bluetooth speaker using AUX cable, which showed no latency with the video.I have a Bomaker 2021 that I used prior to this and the diff between the AKIYO's 1080p resolution (720p Bomaker) was immediately noticeable. Although the Bomaker had better contrast in the dark scenes and was a brighter overall projector, I still preferred the AKIYO's overall experience.Pros:- 1080p resolution is MUCH better to the eye than comparable 720p or 480p projectors. Do not go with anything lower than 1080p in 2022.- Bright scenes look great (watched Frozen so far)- Aux output works well- Very simple and easy to use interface- Remote is useful (albeit cheap feeling)Cons:- Very low contrast, especially in the dark areas of the screen. Dark colours are absolutely crushed to black, so you lose contrast in dark shirts, dark scenes at night, etc. But, for the price, this is nitpicky.- There is a slight hum from the fan on the projector, but it gets drowned out by movie audio. Again, for the price this is nitpicky.- Not as bright as slightly more expensive budget projectors. In a fairly dark room though, it's fine.",
