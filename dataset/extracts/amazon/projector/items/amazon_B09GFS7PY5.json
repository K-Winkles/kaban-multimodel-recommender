Therefore, I had no hesitation in buying from this company again when I was in the market for a smaller and more portable projector. And this model is much smaller and lighter. Despite that the performance is just as impressive. The package includes both RCA and HDMI cables, a remote, a cleaning kit, and a screen. The only thing you will need are two AAA batteries for the remote. It was easy to setup. Just plug it into the laptop, turn it on, and adjust the focus. The picture was remarkable for such a small and economical device. Even when I projected it on the wall next to a window the picture was acceptable (see pictures). And in the dark it was outstanding. It also has a built in speaker which is helpful since the laptop speaker is not all that powerful. Overall, this is a very nice projector at a very good price. I can see it being useful for demonstrations and presentations. In fact, I plan to bring it on my next road trip and use it to watch streamed movies. That will be much better than sitting in the hotel and squinting at the screen of my laptop.",

                "reviewText": "We recently purchased a Model HI-04 Digital Mini Projector from Dr.J Professional. As a matter of background, we had been using a Dr.J Model AK-30 Full Size Digital Projector for general \u201cTheater\u201d usage. We have been pleased with performance of this full-size projector, and offer the following thoughts on Dr.J\u2019s Mini Model:It\u2019s small size allows more options for discrete in-home mounting opportunities. Also, it is more convenient to use for business and travel purposes. It\u2019s small size is easy to pack.While in a smaller package, video quality is superior to our current full-size projector in terms of brightness, color, and clarity. Our typical placement is 10\u2019 from the screen. At this distance, it provides a crisp 8\u2019 X 4\u2019 image (Approx.).Set-up instructions are simple. If you have a Smart Phone or TV, you will be quickly up and running.The only downside is in over-all audio performance. The small speaker sounds tinny and it detracts from a theater-like experience. We connected our mini projector to an inexpensive Dell computer speaker system, and sound was greatly improved. Audio performance of the basic unit should not be an issue if you plan to use this mini-projector for Power-Point type presentations and the like.Overall, I\u2019d rate the Dr.J HI-40 Mini Projector as a recommended \u201cBuy\u201d for the money.",
