For the lagging issue, we first advise you to change the network into 5G WIFI, or if you don't have 5G WiFi, anycast adapter will help, too How long should we clean the air filter of this projector? Good question! For a better maintenance of GO1 projector with wifi and bluetooth, it is better to clean the filter 1-3months a time. How can I get a clear and sharp picture? 1. Please wait a little while when autofocusing, do not press any buttons. 2. You can also use the F+/F- adjustment on the remote control to get better focusing effect. Why does the projector have sound but no picture when I mirror the screen? 1. Samsung phones: Please enable HDCP in settings and try again. 2. Other phones: Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu are not supported on all projectors due to HDCP copyright issues, but you can enjoy them with a TV stick. How can I hang the projector from the ceiling? 1. Remove the four footpads from the bottom of the projector. 2. Screw the ceiling mount into the holes (1/4\" screw) under the footpads. 3. Rotate the video so that it plays the right way up.",

To be honest I didn\u2019t expect much about the picture quality with the price and size of this projector at the beginning, but turns out the image quality is very good with sharp resolution and accurate and bright colors. The set up process is very easy and only takes short time to connect with my phone/ipad/laptop. I love how it auto focuses to the wall and has two options to change settings with (remote controller&on the projector). Overall a great purchase for me, I was originally use it just for movie nights but also found out it\u2019s great to play video games or watch TikTok\u2019s with too. The build in speaker also has pretty good sound quality and I\u2019m happy for this purchase & has already recommended to friends who has similar needs.",

Fan is designed to be quit when compared to my earlier projector of the similar class. Remote has all the features which the buttons on the projects can do. It is easy to use remote. Manual which came with the box is pretty easy to understand. The sound is loud enough, so you don't need an extra speaker.

The automatic focus adjustment plus 6D-keystone making it so easy to get a clear picture. The sound is loud enough, so you don't need an extra speaker. It comes with multiple connection options such as HDMI, USB, and Bluetooth, and offers effortless screen mirroring from both iPhone and android devices. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase!",

The tradeoff is the left half of the screen is blurrier than the right side. It's certainly not magically automatic like it showed in a video, but it does the job. Also I have to select HDMI every time by pressing, down, down, left, ok, ok to switch to the computer, which is mildly annoying. I would go back and spend twice as much and hope for better quality, but it does the job. Also the built in speaker isn't terrible, but I use good speakers anyway.",

I was able to pair the projector with my iPhone after connecting to the home network. It\u2019s pretty smooth. Lastly, I like that I can just play the movies from my plugged-in external hard drive, and the quality is high 1080, provided the fact that I didn\u2019t even use a projector screen.
