                "reviewText": "I love this projector with some concerns. For the money, this is better in my bedroom than a huge tv could ever be. Keystone and autofocus work well. Setup was easy. Speakers are decent but a Bluetooth speaker can significantly improve the sound. Fan noise is moderate. The included Hako Mini Android TV dongle sucks. First, Plex and Jellyfin had no sound with movies. This may be the L2\u2019s issue but my Firestick worked perfectly. My main concern was that the Hako set off my OPNsense firewall. It was constantly trying to send data to unknown IP addresses. My Apple devices started prompting me for password resets. I\u2019m sticking with my Firestick 4K Max although I wish I could fit it inside the unit like Asus did for the Hako Mini. Once I reset and disabled the Hako, the Apple password reset requests stopped. Coincidence? Who knows?",

It also has the convenient instant autofocus feature to always present the best viewing angle and built in battery for 3.5hr playtime. Perfect for online workout/yoga classes setting as well. I also like the light wall features to get the party vibes.The best of this projector is Android TV Box with easy setup. I can choose multiple apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video\u2026etc. with included remote control.Highly recommended for this luxury designed projector!",
