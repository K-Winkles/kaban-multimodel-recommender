                "reviewText": "I bought this as a treat for myself as well as for use at monthly meetings that I attend and conduct where we could conduct Zoom meetings while combatting the COVID viruses. I researched quite a few projectors but finally settled on this model due to previous reviews as well as the features offered on this unit. for my brother as he wanted a projector for a while and glad I did as he loved the gift.This being my first personally owned projector but familiar with other units while employed (happy retiree now \ud83d\ude0a) I am very, very impressed with the video quality which in my opinion is impeccable when I compare it to those units used while employed. I can definitely see the difference between the antiquated models I was previously used to vs. this 1080P model.The CLOKOWE 9600L 1080P HD 5G WiFi Projector was extremely easy to set up. In less that 10 minutes I was able to start watching a movie on this projector. Once I got comfortable with the unit, which took very little time, I tried USB port & wireless casting via iPhone & windows laptop for playing movies.One of the other selling features for me was the fact that the unit comes with a 100-inch projection screen, but I also experimented and found that it works quite well with no blurriness when projecting on a white or very light-colored wall. The unit did an excellent job in both a darker room as well as an illuminated room.I found playing a 1080p movie to be very smooth, without any distortion or lag. I was also impressed that the pictures were clear and sharp when I tested at a screen size larger than the 100 inch screen provided. In the event that one needs to focus and make the image sharper/clearer, you can rotate the adjusting focus knob that is conveniently located on the side of the unit. I was also impressed as to how easy the menu options that are provided on the screen were very easy to navigate and use. The built-in speakers provided more than adequate sound.To recap, I would highly recommend this unit.",

                "reviewText": "Very good projector for the money. Well-made and relatively easy to operate. The only problem with it is the very low volume of the speaker. You definetely need to buy a good dolby soundbar or else stick your ear to the projector to hear anything. The provided screen is totally worthless; it's just a flimsy transparent veil. If you don't have a smooth large white wall to project on, buy yourselves a good 200 inch screen. But this projector is very bright and responds good to the remote. It mirrors Android very well, and the Bluetooth works fine,too. It's compatible with Dolby sound. I'm very happy with it and recommend it. I had bought a different one of similar price, but had to return it for not supporting Dolby. Also the remote on that one was slow and erratic to act. This one is much much better. After using it for two weeks, I like it even more. I've found out, the hard way, that most problems with the quality of the image are actually caused by a defective screen. After tweeking my low-price screen a lot, I've been able to improve the image to where I feel satisfied. The best screen of all, in my opinion, is a smooth, flat-white wall. Fabric screens present a lot of problems; some are too translucent, others wrinkle easily. But this projector itself renders a very good image, plenty bright (even with one light bulb on in the room).",

                "reviewText": "So we decided to give this a try over a new tv for our gaming and movie nights. Got to say this is perfect for smash bro's with all of my friends. The built in speakers are a great volume for that. When it comes to watching something together it's just lacking a bit. So we went ahead and figured out the bluetooth (had to look up a video on it as it is not mentioned anywhere in the manual). There is just enough of a delay on the bluetooth audio where it drove all of us nuts. So we're going to have to get something that'll use the aux. Not end of the world but would have appreciated knowing that confidently before buying.Overall I'm already suggesting it to friends. It's really convenient and a lot easier to move around than a tv. If your the type that likes to have people over for any kind of screen time, this is an official need in your life.",

                "reviewText": "I have only used this 1 night as it needs mounted in my home, or has to be on a 4 ft. shelf in the center of the room, which doesn't work with kids running around. The sound is NOT loud enough to hear it unless sitting right next to it so if your gonna get it you might think about getting a good sound bar as well as a mounting unit. I think I will like it better once I get it mounted and a sound bar hooked up to it. UPDATE : February 14,2022The company got ahold of me after reading my review and gave me a full refund. I'm very impressed and will be changing the stars I gave them. I would happily buy from this company again.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, I've found this to be a solid little projector. Image is very bright, and I like the placement of the controls: focus using the dial on the side, and keystone correction using the jog dial on the back. The wifi interface works well, but the password dialog doesn't accept long passwords, a minor issue that likely won't affect most users. My main setup is using an AppleTV device via the HDMI port and everything looks great. Again, for the price and features, I don't think you can go wrong with this device.",
