                "reviewText": "I\u2019m rating this five stars because of how much I\u2019ve used it and how much I\u2019ve enjoyed it. It is not perfect, dead pixels are starting to show up here and there and burn in is culminating in the middle (noticeable in darker pictures), but 6 months since I\u2019ve bought this and I am so so so happy with it, I use it literally everyday and there has been days where it\u2019s been left on and keeps on churning. (The picture is square aspect ratio so doesn\u2019t really show the wideness) but this thing blows up huge. Pros, totally affordable and saved me 100s of dollars in going to theater, last time I went to the theater the screen looked tiny. Fan blows quietly you wouldn\u2019t even know it was there. Clear image about 85 percent clarity and sharpness in the image but when the movies playing any tiny details aren\u2019t even noticeable. Bluetooth function is very helpful. Menu is simple to understand. Light weight just pop it on a camera stand is what I did. Portable, though not battery powered I can through it in a bag easy and setup anywhere. Good construction. All around I\u2019ve been super happy with it.ConsSome edges are a little blurred again not noticeable during the film, burn in after 6 months just a light faded color change in the middle noticeable in dark images. Small dead pixels, (might be dust on the light inside but I can\u2019t reach it without getting a long screwdriver and taking it apart), not the easiest to get perfectly aligned but does a good job. Not great for low angles or high angles, better straight on like on camera stand or something. Somewhat dim in pitch black it works well and with just the smallest light you can still see, could be a bit brighter but still works, most projectors have that thing anyways. Not possible to get edge to edge image sharpness, I\u2019ve tried for months but there\u2019s always or corner or a side that is a little less sharp then the other but nothing major or noticeable when involved in a film. Weak speaker, hook up to something better to get full use.All around I love this thing, my friends love this thing my family loves this thing, we watch movies like everyday, so much so we can hardly find anything else good to watch. Thank you guys for this best product I\u2019ve ever bought.Update the screen burn in is getting worse. Still love this thing but I think it\u2019s gonna be out in about 3 months sadly. Hoping I can find a way t replace the led if possible",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this projector because I have a project that I'm working on that will require visuals on display. While wanting to have a short throw projector initially, after doing a bit of research I learned that a short throw projector wouldn't be a) cost effective, or b) a device to be used in the fashion I wanted. So, after some YouTube research, I learned about the Happrun H1 projector. I ordered it, and when it got here found that it even comes with a screen! I ordered a frame to put it on, and once that gets here I'll have more to write. But as for purchasing, it came with a remote, an HDMI cable, a component (red, white, and yellow RCA to 3/4 inch cable, the power cable, a screen to project on to, and the instruction manual. The bottom has a standard camera tripod port, which is excellent. In the use of the projector, you'll find that you can set the projection style from FRONT (projector is in front of the screen) or REAR (projector is behind the screen aka: rear projection), which is awesome \u2014 this is what I wanted. I didn't want people walking in front of the projector, and throwing up shadows or blocking the projectors output. The manual recommends giving the projector time to cool down after 6hrs of continuous use. I haven't tried pairing my phone or tablet to it via Bluetooth, but the options for that are also apart of the projector. It also has speakers, but I won't be using them. The noise from the projector (for me) isn't bad at all. If you're close enough, you can hear the unit's fans running, but I didn't find them to be of issue at all. So, if you were looking to get a projector, and this would be your first one, this is the one I would recommend you start with. A great projector, and it won't break the bank when purchasing. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this projector for $40 on Black Friday, I don't think I'd pay $100 for it, but it was a steal at $40. The speaker is pretty bad but it's relatively easy to connect to a Bluetooth speaker. The picture is good at 100 inches but the refresh rate must be pretty low, fast action scenes get pretty blurry. It's not the brightest projector but it's in my basement so works well for me. The included screen is so thin the light passes right through and makes a double image, so I had to hang a spare white sheet right behind it. Overall I'd give it 5 stars at $40, but I see it's $80 now, so I'd give it 4 stars at that price.",

A solid 5 stars for its performance, quality, and value!Projector gets 5 stars but the screen it comes with gets 2 as the material is pretty much see through. I have the screen projected directly on my wall and it's much better than having it on the provided screen.",

This projector has me seriously impressed with the quality you get for the price, it has far exceeded my expectations. Easy to set up (Bluetooth audio is fantastic), used a cheap 210x210 vertical blind on the wall as a screen and all sorted. It's worth noting that the inbuilt speakers are pretty average, you'll almost definitely need a Bluetooth speaker instead. Well worth the money!",

                "reviewText": "For $100, this projector is shockingly good. It's native 1080p, seems nice and bright, and although it doesn't feel like a premium product, it doesn't actually feel that cheap either. It even supports 60hz and the input lag seems reasonable, making it not too bad for gaming. The speaker isn't even that bad either.. it's not amazing or anything, but it's honestly probably a better speaker than my much more expensive Epson projector.My wife and I bought this as a secondary projector, something we can travel with and bring outdoors etc and for that it's perfect.It has a single tripod mount on the bottom which makes moving it around a snap. You could probably even get away with using this as a permanent living room/theatre room projector as well if you wanted, but you will have to keep it's limitations in mind. To start, the lens is stationary, meaning there is no zoom whatsoever, you have to move it closer to further away to make the image smaller or larger. There is a digital zoom, but I wouldn't bother with that as it will only degrade the image. It does have a slight vertical shift though and it can also be mounted upside down, there's a setting to change the orientation. If you're really serious about having a permanent setup, I would recommend spending a lot more, but technically this could actually work..There is one larger gripe I have with this, the built in video player isn't that great. It seems to only support the h.264 codec and AAC audio, and more annoyingly it seems to stretch the video to fill the screen. That's a bit of an issue because a lot of movies are wider than 16:9, and if the video file was cropped to remove the black bars on the top and bottom, this video player will vertically stretch the image to fill that 16:9 output. So with those file limitations in mind I find this works best with an external device plugged in via HDMI, which makes this a little less portable.In the end though, this was $100 and the image quality is very good, especially for the price. If you're looking for a low cost projector and you want to spend the least amount possible I can't imagine you could do better than this.. I'm honestly blown away by this unit..",
