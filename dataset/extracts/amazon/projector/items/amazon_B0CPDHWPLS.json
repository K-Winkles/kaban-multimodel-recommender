This projector works great, I've wanted one for a while and this one was recommended to me through a friend, and it's so good I felt it necessary to write a review for it. It can be connected via Wi-Fi or HDMI, the color saturation is good even if the room isn't very dark, which is something that even most monitors struggle with at times. It also has a built-in speaker that, while not great, works fine for an average room in case there aren't speakers available. It also doesn't hurt that it looks very cute, and the design is lightweight enough to make it super portable. Overall, 10/10, especially factoring in the price!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. All I can say is wow. This projector is small and compact but puts out a stunning picture for its size. I love the ability to connect through WiFi but note that iOS won\u2019t show copyright movies through WiFi but they play fine through a media/HDMI adapters(not a projector issue, it\u2019s a copyright rule). I was looking for something more compact than our other projector but with a great picture and this fit the bill. It comes packaged well and easy to set up(only took 10 mins). Everything is included to start watching movies or streaming. I started with a picture on my wall and it was beautiful. I\u2019m looking forward to taking this camping next summer and I will also be using it in our backyard. Who doesn\u2019t like a good movie outside?",

I haven't purchased a projector screen yet, but even when projecting onto the wall or the ceiling, the picture quality is very good. Surprisingly good, especially considering how the projector is so small and very portable. I expect that it will be very useful on the go, indoors or even outdoors. The remote is quite responsive, and the projector is highly versatile, allowing for different functions including HDMI or USB connection or screen mirroring from my phone, laptop and other devices. It seems to be good construction as well. I'm happy with this purchase.",

Took all of 5 minutes to setup. The Projector is on something the only thing that it needs is If your going to use it forhome theater I recommend bluetooth surround sound speaker system because the built in volume speaker is low bass. This is great for travel. This projector suit my needs for more brightness yet retaining a small size and weight.",

                "reviewText": "At first when I got the projector I didn\u2019t like it because I couldn\u2019t mirror apps like Hulu or Max or even Netflix due to software that these apps use to prevent piracy. *eye roll* . So as a result you need either a fire stick, google cast , or a laptop that you can plug in. Luckily I had a chromecast to plug in. When I plugged the chromecast in the projector made a weird noise and powered off, it may have been a short circuit, but since then it\u2019s been working fine. I would also say the sound isn\u2019t too great and the device fans really loins and gets hot\u2026so the lifespan is questionable. I\u2019ve had the product for about two weeks. I wish it came with a stand.Now let\u2019s get to the good. The quality of the projector is better than my Vizio smart tv, I\u2019m extremely impressed. It feels like I\u2019m in a movie theatre every time I use the projector in bed. It\u2019s an enjoyable experience. Considering the price point I think the picture quality surpasses my expectations. There are a few hurdles to overcome with casting what you want to watch, so I definitely recommend getting a fire stick or chromecast to watch all your shows and movies. I will consider getting a sound bar and a stand in the future if my budget allows.If you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive projector this is a great option just be cautious of the power issue and using a chromecast.",
