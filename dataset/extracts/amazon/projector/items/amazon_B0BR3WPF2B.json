                "reviewText": "Whatever you do, don't buy this projector. I bought it because it's Phillips and a trusted brand but I've had the worst issues. Setting up the remote with the manual given in the box was a pain. It took me half an hour to finally set up and use the remote. I then downloaded a software update which removed Netflix from my listed apps. So I had to do a factory reset just to get Netflix back. It got stuck with setting up the time and date, so I manually set that up and no matter how I changed it, I couldn't login to Netflix.Finally when I did login to Netflix and switched the projector off and on again it made me start right at the beginning from choosing language and setting up date and time. Every time you switch off the projector and switch it on again, you have to choose the date and time. It even signs you out of all the apps, so you have to sign in to them all over again every time you want to use the projector. I was looking forward to this and now I'm so disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Philips Android TV projector, and it has definitely helped transform my home entertainment experience. This projector has built-in Netflix and YouTube apps which is awesome for being able to move it around or take it somewhere else, not having to rely on connecting an external device to stream content from. It has an impressive array of streaming options right out of the box. Just a small note: make sure to follow the instructions and if you want to get the most out of the smart app features, follow their advice and avoid the updates so it doesn't interfere with the app compatibility.The image quality is very good for the price, giving a very nice display when watching movies and shows. Especially noteworthy is its 4D-4P Keystone and zoom capabilities, which make setting up for the perfect viewing much easier, especially in tighter/smaller rooms like mine.One of the best features has been the projector's compatibility with a variety of devices and flexible connection options. Whether it's my computer, phone, Xbox, or fire stick, the projector has connections and options for everything and allows you to select between them seamlessly. The WiFi and bluetooth connections are really awesome and convenient features to have for connecting as well.All in all, this Philips projector has been an excellent purchase for my home entertainment setup. It's a perfect blend of high-quality visuals, user-friendly functionality, and versatile connectivity options. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good projector at a solid price.",
