If the projector fails to connect to the Internet, please change the network name and password, because sometimes the network name is not changed for a long time, and there may be many hidden users sharing the network with you, causing the network to become more and more stuck; 2. Fans and vents are set in the projector, so you don't need to use wet towels to cool down, otherwise it will be counterproductive. Please place the projector in a ventilated, normal temperature environment. 3. When using the projector, be sure to remove the protective plastic bag, which will affect the heat dissipation of the projector; 4. If the manual T-shaped correction function on the projector fails, professionals can disassemble the projector by themselves and repair the adjustment lever between the projection screen and the lens; it is not recommended for people without professional skills to disassemble the machine. 5. When the projector is turned on soon after the screen disappears, but the sound can still be heard, it may be that the temperature control protection function of the projector is working, because dust accumulates inside the projector after long-term use, which affects the heat dissipation function. After cleaning the dust, wait for the projector to cool down sufficiently, restart the projector, and you can see the screen; 6. If the projected image has small black dots, you can try to pick up the projector and tap with appropriate strength from the top and bottom to shoot the dust off the screen; 7. If the sound of the speaker installed inside the projector is too high during use, it may affect the use effect and service life of the speaker, please try to lower the sound of the speaker; 8. The remote control sometimes fails. Please replace the battery or keep the distance between the machine and the remote control close. 9. The tripod hole and ceiling hole of some projectors are shared. Please fully confirm when using it. 10. If the machine cannot share the same screen or cannot be turned on, you need to use our software to flash the machine.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This projector is great for outdoor movie nights, apartments, or bedrooms. This projector can stream at 720p HD (not 1028p). This projector is 225 lumen (not 7500). This projector can go up to 120 inches (go any more and the image will be blurry). It is true, this projector does not play Netflix, or Disney plus, that is because their movies are copyrighted, so it is not the projectors fault. The fan in this projector is quiet. The keystone is not amazing it blurs the other side out when using so you have to keep the projector level. I do wish the projector could go a bit bigger, but the size is fine. The focus is not great, the bottom and top are a little blurry when you go really big. Over all this projector is a great value. I truly do love it.",

Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021I ordered this in hopes of replacing my living room Television for something bigger and cheaper. I was more than impressed with what I got though.First off it\u2019s with so that\u2019s awesome. Also, the picture quality is great! It\u2019s like watching a movie from the theaters at home. Nothing is blurry once focused. It also has attachments that you can connect your Roku or fire stick into so no need to keep your phone busy and draining battery. It is also very light weight and can be taken outside to do cool stuff for Warner activities! (Slide shows for parties, movies for the neighborhood, to your friends house with the small tv, really anything.) It probably can be taken anywhere, especially with the bag that it comes with.Overall, I\u2019m really happy with my decision to switch to a projector and this particular projector has been amazing for me with all the attachments abs how easy it is to move and take it on the go. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better turn out!",

La primer foto que tiene mayor contraste es la reproduccion en mi pared blanca con tinte leve amarillo de UHD-4K ..de mi proyector Epson. La segunda foto a la derecha con menos contraste es la reproduccion 1080p de este proyector CHINO, que parece un juguete, no pesa nada y mis amigos se reian de mi porque pensaban que habia botado mi dinero con esta compra. La tercera foto hacia la derecha proviene de la proyeccion de este proyector Chino, donde hice un ajuste al maximo de todos los controles los controles que tiene este proyector contraste, color, gamma, hue, brillo, etc. y logre lo que ustedes pueden apreciar. Este proyector Chino quedo con una imagen superior al EPSON (UHD-4K) a un costo de $75 dolares. A LOS AMIGOS DE AMAZON SE LOS RECOMIENDO.",
