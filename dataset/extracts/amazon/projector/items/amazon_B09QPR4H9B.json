So, I went ahead and ordered this projector, and all I can say is excellent! I am well pleased with this unit, it is exactly what I would expect out of a projector.The installation was pretty easy because in no time I had it up and running. I tested this with a USB drive, and I was able to access the files on it, and then using my laptop with the HDMI cable to watch movies.Picture quality is great.The image is sharp and vibrant, and the brightness is surprisingly better. It also came with an HDMI cable at no extra cost. The display is very clear, bright and sharp.It\u2019s nice and bright on my wall with the curtains closed and even with a bit of ambient light from a skylight has a good bright picture.Some of the most outstanding features include high-quality images. It has a contrast of 3000:1 that is impressive if put against its price. It has an upgraded powerful LED light source that makes it deliver bright images. I don\u2019t have to keep the blinds closed when watching my favorite movies.It runs really cool, after a 2 hour movie it is barely warm. The fan is not loud, and I didn't even notice it during the movie.The speaker is much more than I expected, it is clear and has decent sound on its own.This projector plays all video formats.I like its design which is amazing, and the color is exactly what I wanted, jet black. It is indeed attractive and super good.Overall, great value for the money!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After much research I decided to purchase this projector. It took me about a month to make my decision because every projector I looked at had several reviews that seemed like nightmares. I pulled the trigger on this one because of the great reviews, and high valued customer support remarks.Let me tell you; this has been one of the best purchases I have ever made. I use it every weekend for movie night by the pool. I love it, the kids love it, and the projector itself is a high quality product. The clarity and picture is excellent. The sound from the speakers is excellent; however, if your making a bunch of noise just by an aux cord, and hook it up to a louder speaker system. I had a JBL waterproof speaker which is very loud, and we can make as much noise as we want while watching our movies.On top of everything, set up takes about 2 minutes as we have thousands of movies on an external harddrive that we just plug into the back of the projector.If your in the market for a projector, don\u2019t waste your money elsewhere. Buy this one because it will last, its great quality, and for the price it\u2019s a steal. Buy this now, quit searching, you won\u2019t regret it.",

                "reviewText": "You will like because of the cost:quality ratio.It's cheap and it's really cool if you have never had a projector before. There isn't like having a 6'x8' motion picture on your wall. The picture quality is almost compatible to the old plasma screens that would blow your mind back in the day.Though the richness fades the further back you go and fade is by half during the day. You need blackout curtains if your planning to use it as main tv.I have a 4k fire stick and it looks good but....Here's the skinny....if your looking into these and want to get your feet wet ..this is nice...however, this was an impulse buy for me. It's really got me interested in seeing what the cost:detail ratio is on a brighter, more options and sound quality would do. say, would buying one that is 10k lumens be better or more detailed like a actual tv. In some cases its just as nice as a maybe a udh tv but thats a push or more like just sitting in a fast car. You feel like your going faster than you really are.So, really, this model is good for the money in the price range for what your plans are. Like are you just web surfing or are you gaming? Not Facebook gaming. Gamers are not so much surfers. If you think your a gamer because you play games your not a gamer. That's the point I'm getting at and that's pretty much the thought process in these shopping options.Buying a $60 projector thinking your a videophile then, being disappointed because it's not something that flows like a regular tv is all on you. But, buying a high end one thinking it's the be all end all to your viewing fascinations has diminishing returns that will leave you with regret later. As you see the price goes from as low as $30 to over even a $2000+. There isn't a happy medium when your thinking more expensive means better quality.I like it and $60 for something that works way better than the last pair of shoes I bought and lasts longer is a deal to me. It just doesn't beat picking up a perfect $3600 massage chair being thrown out on bulk pick up day all because the tracks for the motor cracked and fell out. All I did was jb weld them in and now I got a awesome anti gravity full body massage chair I almost don't deserve. I feel bad for the people but, I don't remember who's house I got it from. Eh..thems the brakes...",

It\u2019s not distorted or pixilated.Sound is great as well again I have a smaller room so it does sound great no need for a speaker system or sound bar.Now I bought a fire stick and it\u2019s compatible and I also was able to us the HDMI cable that came with. Here are some pictures and videos of how it sounds. Also I would suggest to buy a tripod for it so it may rest easy on a self or table.",
