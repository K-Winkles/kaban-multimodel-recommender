                "reviewText": "I have had several projectors before.PROs:This M7 Projector is actually 4K native as that resolution is showing as 4096x2160 24Hz SDR PCM when connected to my PC via a USBc HDMI adapter as so excellent as a 2nd screen. 300 inches max size!The Keystone function works on all 4 axis to give full control as does the Zoom feature. That allows for the projector to point from a desk diagonally across the room at the wall and then straighten up the resulting image to be perfectly rectangular.It runs on Android 9 like a Smart TV / Phone with many apps built in: Netflix, Google Play Store, Youtube, Chrome Web Browser apps (sideloading .apks also possible). I'm using the 5Ghz WiFi option for better speed due to less interference. The included remote is good but I connected a mini USB wireless keyboard with a built in mouse pad and it just works no drivers required. Much easier to type in the WiFi key and use the mouse pointer on screen.Android photo frame screensaver included etc..Assume games would work as well.Remembers settings on power cycle.CONs:The Fan is always on for cooling and so it's noisy unless you have sound / music playing.Do not stare into the 20,000 lumens (TBC) lens as it's bright, risk to eyes - so not kid friendly unless mounted on the ceiling using a $10 bracket.Can't comment on 8K HDMI direct source as I don't have one yet. But 8K video played back on the PC desktop / app will display. Resolution is definitely much better than 720 HD / 1080 UHD projector.Unable to upgrade firmware / Android OS version via provided OTT app / link.",

As advertised it\u2019s Super bright and clear. however the hanger needs to be one hole hanger to hang it up. Not fit my four point hanger. Takes long time to adjust it . Be aware if you buy the projector hanger . It comes with one screw hole only. So far so good. Will post later if anything changes!",
