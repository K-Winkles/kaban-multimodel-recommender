                "reviewText": "While this can take a 4K signal in, it only displays 1080P output resolution.The quality of the display is good for 1080, but this is NOT a 4K display (just to be clear).This projector has reasonable features for a projector in this class, but is a bit pricy compared to other similar projectors.The keystone adjustment is limited in range (you can only make small corrections for keystone) and the focus could be better (it is hard to smoothly adjust the focus ring).The unit is very bright though, and it can easily be seen during the day. This is its redeeming quality, that the unit is bright.The projector comes with a screen you can set up (you have to pull the screen taunt to get the wrinkles out).There is a lens cap to protect the lens from dirt and dust.I took one star off because no matter what I tried, I could not get Bluetooth to work with my iPhone or my MacBook Pro.To use Bluetooth, you need to go to the Bluetooth setting and turn on Bluetooth, then select 'search'. But no matter what I did, I could not get the projector to see my devices, or vice versa.We plan to use this for our Halloween display, but it will be wired via HDMI.Overall, a tad expensive, especially since I could not get Bluetooth to work.",

                "reviewText": "This projector is freaking awesome... Especially for the price! I was really weary given the low price but was pleasantly surprised. The picture was really clear. The whole thing was really easy to set up and it was actually really easy to connect to my Xbox as well as my phone. The sound on it is pretty clear. It's not very loud, but it's easy to hook it up to a speaker separately from whatever device you're doing your video w Like I had it hooked up to my Xbox and had Separate speakers hooked up to it to get like really loud crystal clear sound and it was amazing. It was extremely simple to focus the picture and get it where it was really clear and really sharp and the Screen that comes with it is actually really surprisingly Thick, but not so thick as to make it unwieldy or anything as a regular screen. And the screen is actually surprisingly durable. Like, my cats are jerks, but. Managed to not tear it down and rip it or anything when they were being their normal Kitty cat annoying selves.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice little projector. I got it mostly for outdoor movies during the warmer weather but it will also be used indoors from time to time as well. I was surprised to find that it comes with a \u201cscreen\u201d and little sticky hooks for easy hanging on a wall. I was a little bit intimidated by the directions but it was fairly easy to hook up to my iPad Air. Oddly, it requires my iPad being plugged into the hdmi cable and a usb port on the projector. I, luckily, already had a dongle that works perfectly for this. The directions say that the projector will not work with Netflix. I was very disappointed about this but decided to try it anyway with a movie I had downloaded from Netflix. No problem at all! It played like it should with no problems. That may be because the movie was downloaded and/or I do not have internet at home so my device was not online and I was not streaming but whatever the case I am VERY happy that I will be able to play downloaded Netflix movies!!The movie looked good up on the screen. The picture is sharp and the color is good. The projector has adjustment knobs so that you can tune in the picture even if the projector isn\u2019t 100% perfectly aimed at the screen. I was wondering if it would play sound without a speaker Bluetoothed to it and the answer is yes. It has a decent sound that comes out if it. I have not yet tried playing the sound thru a Bluetooth speaker but do plan on doing so in the future and will update if there is a need to do so. The projector itself isn\u2019t super huge or bulky so it should not be too much of a problem hooking it up outside during the summer. I already know I will be needing an extension cord and probably some sort of power strip to get everything plugged in. This can also be hooked up to a dvd or Blu-ray player for more movie options. The cardboard box it comes in has a nice little handle on it so you can carry it outside or wherever you want it to go.I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.",
