                "reviewText": "This is hands down, the best projector you can get in this price range. Look no further. I bought this in 2016 and installed it in my mancave to watch movies and game on it and it's amazing. Truly the envy of all my guests. Not only is the picture clear, crisp and gorgeous, but its bright enough that it's still very visible and clear even in low lighting so the room doesn't have to be pitch dark to have a great picture. Short throw means that I have a 110\" image on my screen with the projector ceiling mounted about 4-5' away.For gamers: Something to keep in mind is that the refresh rate is only 60hz so if you plan on gaming keep in mind you wont get a higher frame rate than that. I'm not sure if there are projectors that display in 120hz or more but at the end of the day, the image size and quality can't be beat. Maybe play on a monitor if you want a higher refresh rate. You're certainly not going to be playing FPS on this as the size is prohibitive to those types of games anyway.Another thing to keep in mind is that if you plan on having multiple devices hooked up, you are going to NEED an A/V Receiver. This only has two outputs. I figured that out afterward but honestly this kind of setup demands a good soundsystem anyway. The sound it puts out is pathetic, but that's not what you're buying this to do anyway.In the summers, I put this out on my deck and put UFC PPVs on a 144\" screen. I feel like I should be charging the neighborhood for the free show they're getting! Once it's dark enough, this thing is bright enough to be seen clear as day.To sum up, this is the one you want. You could spend more or spend less but unless you really want (and can afford) a 4k projector, this is the perfect projector for you.",

The short throw is great since we can show a 120\" picture from like 5 feet away. The built in speaker is good but we don't use that for our small group. Instead we run a small audio cable into the house system.We use this in a office setting with big windows. We show HD videos and have to cover up the windows. But for the most part it is a good projector. Way brighter and better then Optoma that we had purchased prior.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I wanted an 80 inch display in the bedroom but didn\u2019t want to buy another TV but I wanted a picture that was just as good as my 1080p TV. I researched projectors for a while before I pulled the trigger and got this one. I wanted a short throw because my room is small this fills my 80\u201d screen from only 5 feet away and the picture is excellent true 1080p. This one is a little more than the mini projectors I\u2019ve seen on here I actually bought one of them but was unhappy with the picture so I gave it to a friend. You get more bang for your buck with this projector I\u2019ve seen more expensive projectors for 1K with all the features this one has but this is about half the price. If your on the fence BUY IT. My review is real I didn\u2019t get this free from Amazon for my review. I\u2019m a real customer. Hope this helps =)",

I must have emailed them 10+ times with this issue but they keep giving me it my computer or tv or it's a timer option but that's not the case. My tv and computer that is hooked it never shuts down and there is no such time option on the projector. Each time it'll takes me various emails to get a response and each time they respond with a resolution that doesn't make sense. So far I have sent another 3 email since the last time they responded and haven't heard back. I would not recommend by anything from BenQ.",
