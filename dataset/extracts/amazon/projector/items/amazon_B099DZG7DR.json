                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Projector for Neighborhood Meetings",
                "reviewText": "I have to admit I haven't shopped for projectors for a while and I was stunned by how much they have dropped in price in the last 6 years... But I was still a little skeptical that you could get a great quality device for less than $150. I think the last projector I bought was closer to $1,000.Overall I'm stunned by the quality and feature set of this device - at this price point! It really is stunningly bright, and light and portable.I purchased this for use in a neighborhood association clubhouse for our hybrid Zoom meetings where we get about 15 people in person in our 20-ft x 80-ft clubhouse. We keep the lights on during our meetings, so we needed a bright image so our in-person attendees could see both the remote Zoom attendees and any presentations that we need to share. The screen is mounted up relatively high, so that our board members can sit at a table under the projection screen (it's above and behind them), and the projector sits about 12-ft in front of them. Keystone control is really important to us so we can angle the camera up so it doesn't blind our board members.This projector is really bright and totally clear during our evening meetings with the room lights on. The Keystone is controlled by a second dial near the focus ring, and like others have reported: It is kind of tricky to get both the keystone and focus just right. With a really aggressive keystone (because the projector is tilted UP at about a 30-degree angle) you do tend to end with really sharp focus in the middle of the screen and slightly out-of-focus at the top and bottom 10% of the image. This isn't a ding against this device though, just the reality of using it at a really steep angle. If we could mount it from the ceiling where it's got a more direct straight-line from the projector to the screen that problem would be resolved.That said it was incredibly easy to setup, and it's got a built-in speaker that's loud enough that when our remote Zoom attendees speak, everyone in the room can hear them great. I was super happy to discover that the projector has a tripod mounting hole in the bottom, so I was able to use an existing handy cam tripod with it. Once power is plugged in I project to it from my Windows PC wirelessly (including sound), so it only needs the one power cable.You can project from iOS phones and tables, Android Phones, Windows PC's and of course it supports HDMI cables and even legacy VGA if you need it.Another pleasant surprise is that it has IR receivers on both the front and back, so you can use the included remote to turn it off and on, and change any other setting no matter where you are in the room!I'd absolutely buy this again for this use case.",

                "reviewText": "Update:After my somewhat poorer review, the seller contacted me and sent me a new projector. I tested it and am bumping up my review to 4 stars.The new one is marginally quieter, and the picture is definitely brighter.The image quality is about the same.Original Review:The picture quality and brightness are okay.The aux output is a mono output only. So, if you're trying to get a nice stereo sound, or surround sound with the aux output, look elsewhere.The projector fan is EXTREMELY loud. So, basically, if you plan to watch anything, the sound needs to be turned up very high to drown out the fan noise.Also, the screen it comes with is absolutely trash.Pros:-Decent picture quality-Decent brightness-Not a bad price point (if it's on sale)Cons:-Super loud fan-Aux output is mono only-Even with the ultra jet engine fan, the projector gets pretty hot-Included screen is trash-Does not have ability to tilt picture left or right, only up and down",

                "reviewText": "I was so pleased with this projector when I first got it, that I immediately bought a 2nd one within 3 days. I thought about leaving a glowing review immediately, but decided to wait awhile so that I could get a better sense of its performance.It\u2019s 1080 NATIVE resolution, so it looks great.It was easy to set up right out of the box and the first thing I did was connect it to my wifi so that I could project our vacation pictures straight from the phone\u2026 piece of cake.I connected one projector to a Fire Stick and the other one to my gaming console in the same room. I use a Bluetooth speaker with the unit that the Fire Stick is in and it connects every time I turn on the projector without a problem. As with any Bluetooth speaker, there will be a tiny bit of latency, but I don\u2019t notice it at all on the major streaming services, but I do find that it\u2019s noticeable on the free streamers, like Pluto\u2026 but, that\u2019s not the projector\u2019s fault.The projection orientation is variable depending on where you want to place it, whether that\u2019s on the ceiling or behind the screen. I found this helpful with 2 projectors aimed at a corner, I was able to reverse the projection on one and make YouTube visuals converge on the corner and look all that much more interesting.One minor problem I encountered is actually a result of the projector being so good that I bought 2 of them. Since they\u2019re both in the same room and I use them at the same time, the remote control operates them both, so it gets frustrating trying to adjust the volume on one and not the other, for example\u2026 but that\u2019s not a problem that most people are going to encounter.I did have another issue, though. One of the projectors developed a brown stain on the lens that was impossible to remove, but luckily, the projector comes with a 3 yr warranty and it was replaced immediately and without cost to me. A+In conclusion; it\u2019s a great little projector and it really changed the dynamics of the bedroom. It\u2019s nice to have a 4k video of Natural Wonders playing on one screen while watching TV on the other\u2026 or falling asleep to a city skyline or a setting sun on the beach, they\u2019ve really enhanced the atmosphere of the room they\u2019re in\u2026 and the cat seems to love it, too! We\u2019ve discovered an entire genre of cat videos together.I\u2019ve even created a folder in my photos album dedicated to some of the fun thing that I\u2019m able to do with the projectors. I use it to show to people how much they\u2019ve changed the dynamics of the room, and let them see how they could do the same, if they wanted to.At the price that I paid, it was cheaper than any other TV in the house, it\u2019s an absolute no-brainer.",
