Just normal aging I suppose! I started getting custom facials and micro peels to help my skin look healthier and better, so I wasn't really looking for anything special on a cleanser, just wanted to have something to wash my face with lol! I got a 2 ounce bottle just to try it and my skin feels clean and clear, soft, has a lot better texture and is also a lot more even, which is something I didn't get with other medical grade products. I will use this cleanser from now on. I love that it has a very gentle fragrance and is clear, easy to wash and leaves my skin feeling like new, I just love it! Strongly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Okay, I just received this so I can\u2019t speak to its efficacy as of yet but I will warn others since I had a mishap opening it last night. When you first open the top to remove the \u201cseal\u201d which is barely attached to the bottle, please be careful and do not put your fingers near the bottoms of the metal lid. I sliced my pinky, down to the bone, on that bad boy as it\u2019s insanely sharp if you apply any pressure while twisting. I thought maybe there was a chipped piece but after inspection it was as smooth as silk and as sharp as a used razor.I\u2019ll edit and add my ACTUAL thoughts on the product once I\u2019ve used it enough to see any results. I can say that after one use that my face does feel softer and a little less dull/dry. Fingers (what\u2019s left of them anyway) crossed as to it being as good as the other reviewers say!8/18/23 Update: it\u2019s working beautifully! My hormonal acne has been under control for a couple of weeks now and my skin is looking clearer and feeling so soft/exfoliated. I recommend, at the very least, giving it a try but be careful of that razor sharp lid. Lol",
