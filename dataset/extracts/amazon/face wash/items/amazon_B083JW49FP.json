It is now free of added fragrance and contains more glycerin plus an updated blend of mild surfactants and skin soothing willow bark extract\u2014all protected with a better blend of preservatives. I like to use the lotion style all skin types version in the morning and this gently foaming normal to oily formula in the evening. Both are made in Korea, and Korean formulated skincare has been garnering enthusiasm in the international skincare world for the last few years. $5.99 for 16 oz. makes this a bonafide beauty bargain!",

This new formula must be to save production costs, because this product has gone from great to terrible. The ingredients list is now full of toxic ingredients we always avoid. The scent is HORRIBLE. The formula dries the skin out way more than the old formula, probably due to the addition of benzyl alcohol. We returned the bottle for a refund. We will never use this product again so long as they stick with this \"new formula.\" Shame on Whole Foods / Amazon for completing ruining a great product.",
