So I felt relatively safe trying this cleanser. It's been a lifesaver!It arrived right before what has been the worst eczema flare up I've ever had. This cleanser isn't heavy. The scent is mild yet pleasant. It's also soothing and somehow refreshing. I'm excited to try more products from this line!One note of caution: my former cleanser came in a pump bottle. One pump dispensed the right amount. It's been a while since I've used a squeeze bottled cleanser. The first time I used it, I ended up dispensing a lot. A small amount of this cleanser does the job though!",

                "reviewText": "As someone who wears a lot of make up, this facial cleanser is okay. It\u2019s not a deep clean so I use a make up remover balm first and toner after. If I\u2019m washing my face without having any make up on then this face washer is decent. Leaves my skin feeling smooth.My only issue is it burns my nostrils when I use it in the shower. Never had this problem before",
