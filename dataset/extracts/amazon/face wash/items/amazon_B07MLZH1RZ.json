Some made me break out worse, some didn\u2019t work, and others made my skin inflamed. This product is so gentle and exfoliates just a little bit\u2014the perfect amount. Scent is gender neutral and light/not too strong. Leaves my completion clean and not oily or dry. It\u2019s helped SO MUCH with scaring from past acne too\u2014it started reducing the red scars within two washes. Worth the $20. Takes off makeup easily. I apply it directly to my dry face, wet my hands and scrub my face a little with my hands, cup water with my hands and rinse my face off, then use a clean cloth to dry my face.",

                "reviewText": "How do we really know how well any soap or cleanser works as far as doing what it's intended to do -- how well it cleans and how good it really is for our face. It's difficult to assess. What I/we can say is that this product did not come with any negatives; had no negative effect on me.First, it seemed to last forever. You will definitely get a lot of use out of one unit.My face never felt dry after use, only clean and revitalized.Not the easiest to use, though, as you have to make sure it stays out of your eyes (as with almost every product anyway), but I never had any issue or any irritation whatsoever. Applying the product and using the right amount of water to spread will take some getting used to.What I really love about this product, among other things, is how easy and convenient it is to have while traveling! No soap container to worry about; lasts a long time; compact and lightweight; not at all messy!",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic dupe for Tarte's rainforest charcoal scrub stick.EXCEPT: this smells SO GOOD. And you get a great quantity of product. Men and women can definitely use this. I would describe this as a scrub, but not necessarily a medicated product.I recommend using in the shower and applying a gentle moisturizer/toner afterwards. I noticed it increased the effectiveness of my topical skin medicine because it did a good job of washing away the dead skin.",

No need to worry about messes from spills (as had happened to me with liquid or gel-like face washes), and easy to fit in a dop kit.Product also lasts a long time, probably about three weeks to a month with regular use.",
