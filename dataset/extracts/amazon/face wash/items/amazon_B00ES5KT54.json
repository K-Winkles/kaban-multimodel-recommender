                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Brightening Face Cleanser for years probably close to a decade. I started using this along with their other products in their brightening line to help with my severe hyperpigmentation (mostly due to sun damage). It is magically AMAZING how incredibly foamy this becomes once applied with warm water (or whatever choice temperature you choose). You ONLY need a pea sized amount of soap, even LESS to wash your face. Im 58, and have combination skin. This leaves my face squeaky clean and somewhat taut, but somehow does not dry out my skin. It just creates a beautiful base for my toners, serums and moisturizers. I could see how some might find this drying so unsure if how this would work for very dry or sensitive skin. When used with the brand\u2019s Pigmentar Serum Visible Dark Spot Reducer I saw definite results in reduction of several dark spots on my face. However consistency is the key as well as patience. I saw results in approx 6-8 wow which is typically ideal for effective skin care. Erno Laslo iconic \u201cblack bar\u201d soap, my 2nd favorite cleanser, is similar as to how this cleanser leaves my skin feeling. However, LaRoche-Posay will always be my first go to. It gives me the luxe high end results I receive from my Erno Laszlo soap at an amazing price, due to the fact the Pigmentclar cleanser always, ALWAYS lasts me a super long time. Highly recommend this cleanser as well as the brand.",

This cleanser keeps my skin looking brighter, feeling soft, and smooth. I have dry sensitive skin, but this cleanser doesn\u2019t leave my skin feeling irritated or tight after cleansing. My dark spots have lightened and my pores appear smaller! I\u2019m very pleased with this product!",

                "reviewText": "Ive used this for a couple weeks now and this is what i have noticed. You only need half a pea sized amount and emulsify it in between your hands then apply to damp face. I used to have very uneven skin-tone and reddened face due to daily retin A cream use and this has not only evened out my skin-tone but also brightened it a bit. I also have extremely dry skin and i found that this actually did not make my face as dry as when i was using cera ve moisturizing cleanser (which is kind of ironic). Does a absolutely amazing job definitely recommend just be patient with results!",
