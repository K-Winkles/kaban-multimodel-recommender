I like the fact that it doesn't stain the shower tile like some others I have used which takes a little bit of scrubbing to get off. The scent is especially strong and masculine somewhat like a cologne. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean, not dry or irritated one bit. I also have a large beard and doesn't seem to effect that negatively either. Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase and would buy again. \ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "Weak quality control - the seam at the top was broken on all three tubes. The first time I used it I got face wash all over the place because it came out of both ends. I thought I must have gotten a dud or it got damaged in shipping but when all three had the same leak in the same spot this seemed like a bigger problem. I can use the tube and the product is decent, I just don\u2019t have to open the cap to get the product out. Won\u2019t buy again, at least not in this form.",
