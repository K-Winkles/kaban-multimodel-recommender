                "reviewText": "The splendor of June's blossoms, a thousand gifts of beauty carefully preserved into a fairy light foam that soothes and cleanses the most delicate face.This rose aroma is spectacularly genuine. I grow roses in my garden and am surrounded by the brief emergence of wild roses each spring here in the northwest mountains. My nose would know if the roses I grow and those in the bottle were not true but faux.The bottle lasts a long time. I had used about half of it when my daughter was struggling with her very sensitive skin and I surrendered my precious rose cleanser for her to try. She loved the scent, non-sticky texture (she's hated that since she was a wee one) and ease of use. It did not irritate her skin like many other products have.My 48 year old face enjoys the softness and simplicity of this cleanser. It removes my make-up which I keep natural looking so I can't comment if your make-up is applied like spackle with surfer's dream catching the wave eyebrows, but if you enhance your face with a touch of grace and balance this cleanser will have no challenge cleansing it.I truly appreciate products like Andalou. The benefits of a non-gmo, cruelty-free, GF, vegan and it's 99% naturally derived. There may be other rose scented products on the market but in their barely pronounceable ingredients list you'll see \"fragrance\" which can mean thousands of chemicals. Stick with the kind that grow naturally and your face will thank you.I've started trying out other products in their line - like the Pumpkin Honey Glycolic brightening mask - oh my goodness it's like autumn pumpkin spice latte spa aromatherapy!Excellent product, I will be buying it again.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this product since May, 2016, and just now decided to write a review.My skin is very sensitive, and I had used cleansers at different price points (Cle de Peau, Clarisonic, Clinique, Neutrogena, Garnier, Cetaphil, Lancome, La Roche-Posay, etc.) in the past. I was always on the look-out for new cleansers because at that point no cleanser seemed to be in agreement with my face, so this is how I found this product. I thought it was cheap, but it was natural, so I had nothing to lose and decided to give it a go.I bought my first bottle sometime in May of 2016, and started using it as instructed - morning and evening, and let me tell you - I haven't looked at other cleansers since. I can't say enough good things about this cleanser. It leaves my skin clean and feeling fresh all day long. I have oily T-zone, and I hate the feeling of grease/oil on my face. Other cleansers would feel good for about 3-4 hours post-use and then I'd be back at feeling oily and gross. After using this cleanser my face doesn't feel oily, nor overdried.With regards to makeup, I discovered that it is also a fantastic make-up remover. I have full face of make-up (read: primer, foundation, concealer, setting powder, bronzer, and blush) on a daily basis, and in the evening I use the cleansing foam to remove all of it and it's working like magic! It dissolves and take out all of the makeup and dirt that's collected over the course of the day. When drying my face, I would often find make-up residue after washing my face with other cleansers, which would eventually cause me to break out, but not with this cleansing foam. I do three pumps in the evening, which is enough to cleanse my face; no make-up residue on my drying towel, nor breakouts on my face.The best thing is that after over 2 years of consistent use, the product is still working great with my face. I strongly recommend it!",

This one lathers nicely, cleans effectively without drying my skin, and rinses off easily. It smells amazing to me -- reminiscent of rose and peony with a faint hint of strawberry. I can't speak to its ability to reduce wrinkles, prevent breakouts, or firm skin. For me, it's just a basic cleanser that does it's job without irritating my skin, even during my winter dry spells. At this price, I see no reason to buy any other cleanser after using this one.",

                "reviewText": "I've only recently discovered this is sold on Amazon instead of me going to my health food store. Price is I think around 1-2$ cheaper here. For those who may be wary about online cosmetic package safety - I ordered two bottles and both came in their boxes, and individually plastic wrapped in addition to that.ABOUT PRODUCTThis is a foam product with a lovely rose scent, and if you use this every day and night, should last around a month, give or take how much you use (sometimes I like to use on my neck and chest).I have sensitive-reactive skin. If there are too many ingredients in a product, I itch and get red patches on my face for a few hours. This product helps to subside random breakouts, reduce redness, and calm the skin, leaving a very soft and supple feeling after use.I recommend using this before bed and in the morning. But, when using this before bed, I'd recommend using one of those silicon face scrubbers to apply the product. It really helps remove grime on a deeper level before bed, when your skin does the most regeneration.",

                "reviewText": "Eins vorweg! Ich habe sehr trockene Haut mit Unreinheiten! Eine schlimme Kombi!Ich bin schon jahrelang auf der Suche nach DEM Cleanser! Ich habe es mit Reinigungsmilch, mit \u00d6l, Reinigungsgele und Lotions versucht, aber entweder sah meine Haut danach speckig oder trocken aus! Nat\u00fcrlich macht meine Neurodermitis auf dem Gesicht und auf meinen H\u00e4nden ihr \u00fcbriges! Also probierte ich und wurde immer wieder entt\u00e4uscht. Durch Zufall bin ich dann auf diesem Cleanser gesto\u00dfen! Leider gibt es diese Firma nicht in Deutschland, sodass ich sie hier bestellt habe. Ich habe ca. 15\u20ac bezahlt! Manche m\u00f6gen es viel finden, aber wenn ich \u00fcberlege wieviel Geld ich schon aus dem Fenster geworfen habe, dann sind die 15\u20ac nur ein Tropfen auf dem hei\u00dfen Stein.Zun\u00e4chst die Flasche: Die Fl\u00fcssigkeit befindet sich in einer soliden Plastikflasche! Viele sagen jetzt es soll aus Glas sein, aber wenn die Flasche runterf\u00e4llt (und das passiert schnell mit nassen H\u00e4nden), dann w\u00fcnschen sie sich kein Glas mehr!Die Fl\u00fcssigkeit an sich ist farblos! Der Schaum ist toll und kompakt und verschwindet auch nicht so schnell. Der Duft ist toll! Wer keine Rosen mag, soll lieber einen gro\u00dfen Bogen um den Cleanser machen. Er riecht nach t\u00fcrkischen Rosen!Ergiebigkeit: Sehr gut. Man soll nicht mit den Schaum \u00fcbertreiben sonst trocknet die Haut arg aus! Lieber einen halben bis einen Pump reicht aus! In Verbindung mit einem Konjac Sponge unschlagbar!Ich pers\u00f6nlich lasse den Cleanser am liebsten vollst\u00e4ndig einziehen, damit der leichte Peelingeffekt funktioniert (Fruchts\u00e4ure)!Ich pers\u00f6nlich werde es nur im Sommer verwenden, da er dann doch zu wenig Feuchtigkeit spendet, aber im Sommer einfach genial! F\u00fcr Mischhaut ist sogar eventuell eine ganzj\u00e4hrige Anwendung denkbar.Leider gibt es nur wenig Produkte, die man in Deutschland erhalten kann, deswegen ist es schwer, welche der Serien von der Firma zu einem passt, aber die Sensitive Reihe ist toll, sodass ich annehme, dass die anderen Serien unschlagbar sind. Hoffe, dass die blaue Serie (f\u00fcr sehr trockene Haut) auch bald hier erh\u00e4ltlich ist und zwar nicht zum Wucherpreis.Also Leute, gibt der Marke eine Chance! Ich habe es getan und bereue es nicht. Im Gegenteil werde ich mich bem\u00fchen noch mehr Produkte auszuprobieren, besonders deren Sonnenschutzprodukte!",
