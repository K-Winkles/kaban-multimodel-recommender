It\u2019s has a jelly like consistency and slightly foams when activated. It helped clear my acne as well as not dry out my skin. I have combination type skin so it\u2019s very difficult to find any skin care product that helps with both oily and dry spots. This face wash is definitely my number one and i would recommend it to anybody no matter your type of skin.",

I use it only once at night at the end of the day with coconut oil as a moisturizer, and in the morning, I just rinse my face with water and use a sunscreen face lotion (as recommended by my friend). When I wash my face, I let the soap just sit on my face undisturbed for 30 seconds before lathering it again and washing it off. It's left my skin practically acne free, which I've never had for almost 18 years. The best part is if I skip a day or two without washing with it, my face is still acne-free! It's long-lasting, effective, and worth its price.",

Now it works about as well as anything I can pick up at the grocery store. It still clears the oils off of my skin, but the \u2018skin refinement\u2019 is missing. It looks and smells different and doesn\u2019t foam.Why did they change it!? It was perfect.So, I\u2019m off to the dermatologist for a consult. I\u2019m not willing to lose this type of product, I\u2019ll just have to find another.",

I use it whenever I feel a breakout coming on - as directed, I leave it on for 30 seconds as a \"mask\" and then rinse off. I only use it on troubled areas, as it can be very drying. I find that about 90% of the time, it suppresses the breakout.",
