                "reviewText": "The smell is so delicious (light and orangey) Perfect for children with sensitive skin. Gave my girls that \u201cgrown up\u201d feeling to have a cleanser like mom without drying out their delicate skin. Follow with the moisturizer from same brand. Even works nicely on adult combo skin, which is a plus.Update: ordered again and packaging has improved. Used to come assembled but that caused leaks in shipping. Thank you for updating the packaging. What a difference.",

                "reviewText": "This is our first time using this product. I bought for my 3 year old daughter to teach her to wash her face (gotta start 'em early!). When we opened the package, some of the cleanser leaked out of the bottle, not sure how. The cap was off, so maybe the pump was pushed down sometime during transport. Well, because the label was wet, it was very sticky and the first time I put the bottle in my hand, the design/words on the label rubbed off (was not intentionallly rubbing off). Then the label started getting sandy since the actual label was disingrating. We finally just peeled off the whole label after only having this product for 10 minutes. This is probably more of a big deal for me since one of the reasons I was interested in this product (and my almost 4 year old daughter) is because of the label. It added a bit of fun that could have helped me keep my daughter's interest.From first use, the cleanser itself seems nice. It's gentle, has a pleasant fragrance, and we like that it foams.",

It smells nice. Feels lovely on your skin and foam is fun. I have to admit I have used it to see what it was like and now we all use it. And will be buying more when it runs out. My skin feels so incredibly soft afterwards without moisturiser and all round amazing product. I even had a couple of people comment how soft my face was as I tested some make up whilst shopping. You get what you pay for and would highly recommend. Great for sensitive skin.",

I've found it hard to find a product aimed at her age group but this product is packaged nicely, neither too babyish or too grown up.After 2 days of use her skin has recovered and is no longer dry, she loves the smell and having her own face wash has made her feel grown up. Would definitely recommend this",
