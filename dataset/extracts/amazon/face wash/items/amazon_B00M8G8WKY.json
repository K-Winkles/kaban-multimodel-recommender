A derma\u2010tested, blackhead\u2010tackling scrub made with salicylic acid. It moderately exfoliates, helping to clear blackheads, and unclog pores, for a more even skin tone. It\u2019s also infused with olive leaf extract which the Egyptians saw as a symbol of heavenly power. And who\u2019d argue with that? Our green tea leaves come from China and are processed in the traditional Chinese way. This involves heating them to stop oxidation so they stay that lovely vibrant green color. The goodness is then extracted by very gently by soaking them. It takes a little longer but we think it\u2019s worth it. Natural Ingredients Green Tea Extract Olive Leaf Extract Hydrated Silica Tell me more! This refreshing scrub is oil free, paraben free, dermatologist tested, and non-comedogenic (meaning won\u2019t clog pores), and has a moderate exfoliation level. It also contains 1% salicylic acid acne medication. How to use: Dispense scrub onto fingertips and massage onto damp skin. Spread in small circular motions to wake your skin\u2019s natural circulation. When you\u2019re done, rinse and glow! For best results, use 3-4 times a week. *Based on 52 week unit sales ending 7.30.16",

Es un exfoliante fino en cuanto a que los grumos se sienten como arena de jard\u00edn zen, muy fina; diferente a otros exfoliantes, que parecen az\u00facar. El aroma se distingue pero no es empalagoso, relaja y refresca tanto la piel como el olfato. Se enjuaga f\u00e1cil y no deja la sensaci\u00f3n de ardor o fr\u00edo, recomiendo poner crema hidratante sin olor despu\u00e9s de su uso",
