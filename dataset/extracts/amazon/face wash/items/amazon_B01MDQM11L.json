                "reviewText": "There isn't much fragrance at all, which is perfect for a sensitive skin cleanser. The only smell is what I imagine the ingredients naturally smell like, which is not unpleasant or lingering. This cleanser removes my foundation and primer and leaves no residue at all. Neither contain any sunscreens or silicones, (my skin hates both of those) so I can't speak to how it would work on those. While my skin does not immediately feel hydrated after cleansing (I still need a moisturizer, but that's recommended regardless of what you clean your face with.) I find that the overall texture of my skin is much improved. It feels much softer and less bumpy after about the first 3 days of using it morning and night. I have sensitive skin and papulopustular rosacea and this cleanser helps minimize the effects of the rosacea on my skin. I'm also using a 2% salycilic acid solution twice a week, and between that and this cleanser, my skin is the best it's been in at least a decade. I intend to buy this again and recommend to anyone with sensitive skin or even normal skin.",

I just need one pump on my silicone face scrubber and it's enough to gently clean my skin without making my face feel tight or icky. It's a part of my nightly shower routine. To be honest, I think half a pump is enough for my whole face. Gotta love a decent sized bottle that goes a long way.It's gentle enough to combine with serums without over drying, assuming the serums aren't too much for the skin.TL;DR: goes a long way, gentle but effective cleanser for daily use, free of irritants or intrusive fragrances.

After searching in other drug stores for it, I came up empty-handed and decided to try amazon. I was so thrilled to find it here! My ex-husband is a dermatologist and his recommendations for drug/grocery store skincare products are spot-on. This cleanser is unscented-which I like because perfumes and dyes are NOT good for your skin; the largest organ of our bodies! It\u2019s super-gentle, foams/lathers very nicely & even removes eye makeup completely! And- it doesn\u2019t burn or hurt your eyes if you happen to get some in them; no problem. Great for all skin types and doesn\u2019t leave your face oily or dry or like having a residue feeling afterwards. I use it day and night and I just LOVE this stuff!! 5 stars hands down!",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent gentle face wash. I have combination skin with oily forehead and chin, this did strip off the oil but did not make the rest of my face overly dry as long as I use moisturizer after. I get stress acne in my oily zones, this does make my face feel clean but did not clear every single bump because it is not a strong acne spot treatment, just a regular face wash. However it did not give me more acne even when I switched from my previous wash, and has never irritated sensitive areas. Under eye and even eye lid can be safely washed. (Obviously not good in the eye or mouth.) The scent is noticeable, it is okay but smells more like soap than another pleasant scent, probably because fragrances are irritating to sensitive skin. Maybe not my holy grail but a good gentle wash, I will keep buying this unless I find anything better.",

                "reviewText": "This is a large 'bottle' of cleanser and should last a good long while--which is great, since I rather like this cleansing lotion. Made for sensitive skin (or any skin type at all), and sulfate-free if you are interested in that, it's a gentle alternative to some of my other cleansers. I put this in my shower - love the pump action so it's easy to pump out just enough cleanser.Pump out only a small amount because it does \"foam up\" nicely. Though Garnier instructs that it is fragrance-free, I do detect a very light fragrant, and it's quite pleasant and fresh. Maybe it's all in my head? Maybe when it reacts to my skin I'm so fresh-smelling it's a nice chemical reaction (laugh) - I don't know but I do actually like it. I don't mind a little fresh fragrance to my skin regime, including a cleanser.Garnier lathers up just enough and feels great as I apply it to my face - just as they promise, there's no drying out or tightening. And while rinsing, my skin feels very soft (and not that soft slippery feel that comes from a product being difficult to wash away). Despite the softness, my skin as well feels super clean and refreshed - nice!I do rather like this cleanser from Garnier a lot. More and more I am turning to Garnier products. Good job, Garnier!",
