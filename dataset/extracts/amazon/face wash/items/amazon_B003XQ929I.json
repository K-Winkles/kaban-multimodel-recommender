This cleanser is super gentle and has never burned my eyes if it accidently was washed into the area. There's a scent but it's very subtle and not overwhelming. My skin seems to feel and look more moisturized after washing it with this cleanser. I use this twice a day and have never experienced dryness. This cleanser is very affordable and it's a brand that I can easily find at TJ Maxx or Marshalls for around $10. I like the bottle design too. The pump has never clogged on me and when it's time to pour some into my travel bottles for a business trip, it's not watery and it's easy to get every ounce of the product out. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I have normal skin which is an important thing to keep in mind, I only usually get slightly oily in my t zone and eyelids. I don\u2019t know how this fairs for sensitive, oily, or combination skin.I was looking for a cleanser to help with my skin due to hormonal breaking out caused by my IUD, I saw one reviewer was in the same boat as I was and liked it so I decided to give it a shot! I honestly really love this cleanser!! It doesn\u2019t really have a smell, maybe just a very slight bubblegummy smell but it\u2019s really nice. It is smooth going on your skin, a bit foamy which I enjoy just because I feel it reassured me it\u2019s working (lol), but once it\u2019s dry it\u2019s clear and unnoticeable. After rinsing it off your skin it does feel moisturized and clean but once you dry with a towel it your skin feels a bit dried out. Due to this I like to follow with the use of Derma-E\u2019s \u2018Vitamin E 12,000 IU Cream\u2019 the texture is incredibly nice and it dries so nicely on your face if you\u2019re planning to put makeup on afterwards while still really hydrating your skin. My only turn off to the moisturizer is the scent which is a melon-cucumbery smell but it only lasts a minute or so. I would recommend this product to someone in the same situation as me or that has normal skin with occasional break outs.**5 MONTH UPDATE**I originally thought this could help with my hormonal breakouts/acne but with continuous use I\u2019ve realized that with hormonal acne this isn\u2019t strong enough to fight against it. The name itself says \u201cgentle\u201d which I believe isn\u2019t enough for hormonal issues. I\u2019m planning to remove my hormonal IUD to know whether or not that is causing the breakouts or I will go see a dermatologist so I can get some customized strong acne products. No doubt this is still a great product that makes your skin feel refreshed and clean but it won\u2019t do the trick for hormonal breakouts/acne. I bought it for that purpose and for that reason I\u2019m giving four stars. This is best suited for someone who gets occasional breakouts and has normal skin!",

It foams well, is super soft and has a light scent. There is not any bad junk in it, & it was recommended by a make up artist that I was working with when I had wanted to change up my skin care due to aging. I also tend to remove my make up first, then wash my face with this. I use the Ultra Hydrating Hyaluronic Day cream and Night cream of the same line,& would recommend it to anyone wanting a change. I am super sensitive and break out easily, but have not had any issues with this Derma-E line.",

Other facial washes dry out my skin but this moisturises it and I do find hyaluronic acid is excellent for aging skin. Try it if you have dehydrated skin or the upper layers of your skin are dry and flaky with little bumps. It works wonders. Its also cheaper than other hyaluronic acid cleansers, good value for money. I recommend it.",
