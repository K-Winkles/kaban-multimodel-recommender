My face is extremely sensitive and most things I\u2019ve used (even those that say are natural and for sensitive skins) have cause severe allergic reactions/breakouts. I came upon this product and after reading several reviews decided to give it a try. I can say that this product so far has been amazing. I\u2019ve used it for a few days now without any issues. Love the scent it has and does not leave my face dry or anything and I feel that my face is finally clean. I would definitely recommend and will continue to buy.",

                "reviewText": "I got this cleanser for my boys. Like most teens, they've got extremely oily skin, especially in the T zone, and are acne prone. We've used other products, but most of the ones to prevent acne end up drying out their faces. I found this cleanser on a top 10 face washes for oily skin. After reading the article, I realized that we'd been treating the acne, which is the product of oily skin, instead of the actual oily skin. This cleanser targets the oily skin by cleaning out the pore clogging oils, clarifying the blackheads and clarifying deep into the pores. Doing this then normalizes the skin and helps prevent acne. My boys are really liking this foaming cleanser. It foams up really well and it doesn't take much to wash your entire face. The citrus scent is light and refreshing. They've been using the cleanser and the toner for almost 2 weeks and I can see their acne starting to clear. The first few days they both broke out, but that just tells you that it's working out all of that gunk in the pores. After the initial flare up, there has been no new acne appearing. One of my boys has very sensitive skin and this is working wonderfully for him. I'm extremely happy with this product and will definitely continue to purchase it for my boys.",

It doesn\u2019t foam up like soap, but doesn\u2019t leave any residue. This cleanser works better than any other I\u2019ve tried and is a great value for the price. I use it everyday and have only had to buy it twice in a year. Highly recommend \ud83d\ude0a !!",
