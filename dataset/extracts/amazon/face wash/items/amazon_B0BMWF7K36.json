                "reviewText": "Thanks to two different disorders (hEDS and MCAS) I have extremely sensitive skin AND I can't tolerate scented products. I have to be very careful with pretty much everything I bring into my home and use on my skin, which can be incredibly difficult. Plus, since everything in my home is unscented, I'm now even more sensitive to scents.Otherwise, I'm in my early 40's and have combination skin, and because it's so sensitive it's hard to find the right balance so that I'm either not too dried out, or getting too oily, or that doesn't trigger breakouts or allergic reactions.I started out at least 6 months ago with Biore's Clean Detox moisturizer, which is now my go-to warmer month moisturizer. It has no scent, is very lightweight and caused no reactions. But once the weather started cooling off I instantly found that one pump of the Clean Detox was no longer hydrating enough, and while I could probably do two pumps and be fine, figured I'd take the opportunity to try this version. And I'm glad I did!I won't say that it's 100% scent free, namely because the oils used do have a scent of their own, but there's definitely not added scent, and what does exist is very subtle. To a point that it doesn't bother me at all and others might not notice it at all. It's definitely a creamier/thicker moisturizer than the other, but not heavy at all, and absorbs as well as the Clean Detox does.Currently I'm still using both, depending on what my skin seems to need at the time, but once winter is here I suspect I'll be using this one full time. Thankfully transitioning between the two (which can also be tricky for my skin, it kinda freaks out if there's anything change) has also been easy, with no break outs or anything.So if you have anything close to skin issues like I do, I couldn't recommend these more, especially for the price considering that a little goes a long way.",
