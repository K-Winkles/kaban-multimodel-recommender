                "reviewText": "My dermatologist recommended this face wash to me, and I\u2019ve been using it ever since. I was previously using a face wash with benzoyl peroxide that left my face dried out and constantly needing moisturizer. After making the switch to this, my skin is a lot less dry and sensitive.This foams up nice and easily, and feels very clean and light on the skin. There\u2019s no noticeable smell, and overall just feels like you\u2019re barely using anything at all, yet it gets the job done. You hardly need to use much at all every time, so each bottle lasts a really long time. I\u2019d highly recommend this.",
