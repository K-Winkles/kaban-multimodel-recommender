                "reviewText": "I stumbled upon this product in my seemingly endless search for a more natural face wash for my acne prone skin, I simply wanted to share my opinion on this product as it has been a life-saver and a must-have in my skin care routine (I am not being compensated in any way to leave this review, just a happy customer).This product has a thick-gel consistency but is very smooth (non-exfoliating) and has a light, pleasant, and very clean smell. I absolutely LOVE this face wash because it leaves my skin feeling fantastically clean (removes makeup fairly well when I am too lazy to remove it first before cleansing) without leaving my skin feeling tight, dry or stripped. I have found it very difficult to find a gentle/natural cleanser that really cleans my pores without it being chemically or mechanically exfoliating, so this is a huge plus!This product works very well as a cleaner after rinsing the skin with warm water and gently massaging for a few minutes before rinsing clean. However one of my favorite ways to use this product is with my Mia 2 Clarisonic, it works perfectly with this device to get a deep clean feel and leaves my skin looking incredibly bright and even, I don't even use foundation anymore!In terms of acne, I will say that when I use this product consistently (once in the morning and once at night) I do see a HUGE improvement in my skin tone and texture, and a definite decrease in the amount of breakouts I get. When I am having a bad skin day/week I will cleanse with this product, dry my skin, and then apply a thin layer to my problem areas and leave on overnight as a mask (this will dry out the skin a little and leave it feeling a little tight) but usually wake up with my problem areas healing much faster than they would on their own.Definitely one of the best face washes I've ever used and will continue to purchase, extremely HIGH-QUALITY product and amazingly cheap. This has become a staple in my skin care routine and I always make sure to have it on-hand.",

                "reviewText": "I use this brands toothpaste and love it, never knew they also made face wash. The price was great as I needed a 2 pack for my teenage son when he visits his dad on weekends. The smell is natural, almost reminds me of aloe Vera But it\u2019s light and smells refreshing. One review I read before purchasing said it doesn\u2019t lather like soap, but it does. Another said their package came leaky, thankfully mine didn\u2019t. Grateful I used my own judgement more than I took others. And posting MY experience for others can do the same bc our experiences won\u2019t always be alike nor are they meant to so if the things you care about most are covered, give it try. Although the bottles could have been a bit fuller as mentioned in another review, it\u2019s not a huge deal bc you really only need like a pea size amount and the price is great, if it stays that way of course, currently $11.99. It left my skin feeling clean AND soft asf. And I\u2019ve been known to have sensitive skin but no adverse reactions with it. So No complaints so far.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to wait a couple weeks before I did a review to make sure I was seeing results. But it\u2019s only been 3 days! & I already see/feel a big difference. I have combination skin. Oily & dry. I\u2019ve been trying many diff kinds that usually feel like its just cleaning the top layer. Never my pores & always something left. Some products left my face feeling too dry to move or slathered in oil/lotion, but never CLEAN like I wanted. I feel like this product get rid of all of that. My face feels fresh & smooth! Looks like I did a whole mask.. compared to the \u201cclean\u201d I was getting before. My face is a little brighter. I\u2019ve noticed some of the stubborn blackheads already getting lighter & less noticeable. After just 3 days! Gives a deep clean w/a gentle feel. Doesn\u2019t smell too bad either. Just like a regular \u201cnon scented\u201d soap. Haha. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you\u2019re looking for a deep but gentle clean. Or are struggling to match your combination skin. If you have dry skin already do be careful, I understand why some reviews said their faces felt dry afterward (wasn\u2019t my case), but just to keep in mind! [:",

I didn't think too much of it until it happened again the next night. Not sure if it was a bad bottle/batch but decided not to continue using it.",

I\u2019m in my forties and don\u2019t appreciate anything too drying. This wash hasn\u2019t caused me to breakout and helps keep my acne at bay. I still get cystic acne but the amount, size and frequency is reduced. I alternate this wash and a glycolic wash as well as a salicylic acid spot treatment. So far I am very happy with this product.",
