I have combination, sensitive skin and live in the Pacific Northwest so it\u2019s pretty damp here. This cleanser does not have any fragrance or smell and has a soft texture. It foams up really well and I can get by with less than a nickel size worth. I have used it daily in the morning and evening for years.Pros:Lightweight, foams up wellNo scentNot irritatingNo residue after rinsingCons:None! Seriously. None. I love this cleanser and I hope you do too :)",

                "reviewText": "This is my first Klairs purchase and I am ready to become a faithful devotee to this brand! This cleanser is literally PERFECT! The initial texture is a thick-yet-milky, soft cream. It foams easily and quickly in hands or on face. It completely cleanses the skin and rinses away without drying out or stripping the skin or leaving a residue, and it is unscented. I have never before found a facial cleanser that THOROUGHLY cleans AND hydrates my face! This works wonderfully with my Clarisonic Mia 2, but my face gets clean even when I wash only by hand--that has NEVER happened with any other facial cleanser I have used! Only a tiny amount is needed to cleanse entire face--slightly more than pea-sized but definitely less than dime-sized. The tube I received was completely filled with product, and I wash my face morning and evening. PERFECT PRODUCT, EXCELLENT VALUE, AMAZING QUALITY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

Kinda pricey for size but start with it a little to lather up first.",

                "reviewText": "I love K-products and use them for most of my skincare routine. I was looking for a cleanser that wouldn\u2019t strip my skin. Although I tend to do my skincare right after I wash my face, I do like to feel like my face can go without anything for a bit without being dry and stripped. This cleanser delivered on that! I\u2019ve had it for a couple of months now and I\u2019ve used it everyday and it just feels so nice on the skin. I like the bottle design, easy cap to open and close and dispense the amount you need, and the consistency is just *special*. I\u2019ve never had or seen a cleanser like this one before. A little goes a veeery long way, trust me on this, and what I like to do is just damp my skin and put a small amount on my fingers and then just gently rub it onto my face. It foams very differently from other cleansers. It has a milky foam texture that ressembles a milk cleanser when used on damp skin but with that extra oomph of foamy goodness that is just right. The product is white but is called \u201cblack facial cleanser\u201d because of the ingredients in it which are all derived from black fruits and extracts. When you add some water, it will foam like a regular cleanser - but try it on damp skin first, and thank me later. It washes off all of the impurities, it\u2019s mildly acidic so I would say it\u2019s PH balanced, very gentle and moisturizing and is unscented. I have sensitive skin and this has been my go to cleanser and honestly, the rest of my cleansers have just taken the back seat for now. And the bottle is generous so it\u2019ll last me a long time!",

This cleanser makes my skin glow, clears my pores, gets all makeup off, I\u2019m clean but not feeling tight or like it tampered with my skin barrier or natural moisture. Soooo glad I ignored reviews and tried it. My new holy grail.",
