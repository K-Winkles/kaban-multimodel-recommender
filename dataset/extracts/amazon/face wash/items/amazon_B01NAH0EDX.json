You can FEEL the difference-- I've never used a facial cleanser that just plain makes your skin feel so smooth, tingly cool, and refreshed in one go, and to be able to see that difference immediately too. I think the product works especially well on a person like me because I tend to have oilier skin and break out often.",

                "reviewText": "I have sensitive combination skin that's prone to breakouts, and I love this cleanser. It's refreshing with a slight tingle and leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and soothed. It's great for my oily patches and will do wonders for oily skin, but I recommend pairing it with a moisturizer afterwards, especially for dry skin. I'm looking forward to seeing how it prevents future breakouts, but so far it has a really calming effect on my blemishes. Definitely recommend, especially for the price!",
