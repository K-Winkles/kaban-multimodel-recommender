I have reacted to all sorts of products that are \"approved for sensitive skin,\" and I have only found a select few products where my skin does not flare like a New Year's Eve sparkler. This is one of those products!!!!I double cleanse in the evening- I use this as my cream cleanser now and I will keep purchasing! :) The oil cleanser I use is from Laneige, and you can see I wrote a review on this product as well. I use the two of them together and my skin stays calm.I love this cleanser, not just because my skin approves it, but also because it is not drying!!! It effectively cleanses your skin without feeling like you applied an astringent to your face afterwards. It is super gentle yet effective at cleansing. I think this cleanser could be used for any skin type- definitely dry, sensitive skin approved!!!",
