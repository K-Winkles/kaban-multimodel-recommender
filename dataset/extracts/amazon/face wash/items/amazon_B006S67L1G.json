I got a sample kit of Kiehl's products for a gift and immediately knew this was a product I was going to use all the time. It has been a great make up remove and cleanser day and night. It has left my skin softer and smoother as well as cleaner at night. This night practice has helped reduce wrinkles that form with left over make up on all night.I have had several eye surgeries and this product us pure enough to use around delicate areas as it rinses off well and does NOT dry out my skin. It is a great value and works better than high end products that I find drying.",

                "reviewText": "I found this facial cleanser on a trip to Boston. I have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily, and this Kiehl\u2019s cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out, and with no signs of irritation. I think it costs a lot for a small tube, but a little dab washes my entire face and neck. It\u2019s great quality so I will keep using it m, and I\u2019m happy I found it on Amazon.",
