                "reviewText": "My Dermatologist recommended this about a year ago and I decided to purchase it here because the big price difference. This is Authentic I can tell from my others that I purchased from Dermatologist. I have no doubts at all about the Authenticity. This really cleans my face well ,rids all the oils and daily toxins that we get exposed to on a daily basis. It's gentle on the skin but delivers .For some reason or another my pores have gotten much ,much smaller and less noticeable. I am not sure if it's because of this face cleaner or the toner etc but either way I'm happy.In all honesty I love Image Skin care and will still use but I felt as though it was time to switch back to skin medica for a while.It's a toss up between the two brands but I'm leaning towards this brand more everyday since I have saw more positive changes to my skin.My Husband is now using this at my personal recommendation and it is very noticeable how his skin benifits from the short time he has been using.Like myself his pores are less noticeable and his complexion is nice.Hopefully he will keep on using this .After all men need a good skin care regiment as well.",

The consistency is a bit thick for my liking, almost like a gel. You need extra water to make it easier to lather your face and make it like a cleanser. Even so, I like how clean my skin feels very clean after use and it doesn\u2019t cause any irritation.",
