                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used many cleansers over the years and none (I repeat none) of them compare to this one. I hope they never discontinue this one because I had to buy a different cleanser for a few days use when this cleanser was out of stock and it was a nightmare.I double cleanse in the evening and this feels like the most luxurious cleanser. It works so well to remove all the build up you get in the day and leaves your skin so hydrated and soft. The ingredients are so great and the consistency is thick. It doesn\u2019t dry out your skin and it does so much.I don\u2019t normally review cleansers but this one needs the review. As much as I don\u2019t want it to be out of stock the next time I purchase I have to share this amazing cleanser.",

The reason why it doesnt get 4 starts is that its priced at a premium but I packaging etc don't denote a premium experience in my opinion. Great ingredients that are moisturizing to the skin.",
