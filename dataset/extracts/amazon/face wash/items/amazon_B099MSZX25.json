I like to use a toner after I wash my face to make sure I got off all my makeup and sure enough, it removes all my make-up (mascara and all!) I have super duper sensitive skin and this makes my skin feel so soft. I tend to break out once a month and I feel like this helps tame that. It feels good under my makeup and with a moisturizer with no makeup. This is by far my favorite face wash. Auto ship sign me up, please because I don't ever want to be without this face wash",
