                "reviewText": "I always like Ursa Major, and been buying their products when I run out. I bought the deodorant, wipes and tried the samples that came with purchases. This review is about the face wash. I got this mainly for DH. He wants one that is not too much scent, smell nice to him instead of too fruity or flowery, the right texture,easy to use, and I want something that is unisex and non toxic. It's harder to find good green, non-toxic personal care brands for men. There maybe seem like a lot are out there, but it could be green-washing or mainly targeting women folks. So, when he tried the sample and like it, I know I need to get it. Plus, it is good when both of us can use the same thing, less clutter in the bathroom.For me, when I use it, it removes my daily grimes and SPF, feel clean and no dry/tight feeling after wash. You need very little to lather up. This is a pretty big bottle and will last a long time. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. Oh, Prime free shipping helps.",

HOWEVER\u2014it doesn\u2019t leave residue like creamy soaps do, which I like. Given that, I use this soap once or twice a week.

Removes difficult make-up in one go, doesn't dry my face, has a pleasant smell, and the #1 ingredient is aloe vera. It's pricy, but a little goes a long way. I don't use a ton but it still gets my face very clean. I'm on my 4th bottle of this already!",

It was a little on the expensive side for me, but you truly just need the tiniest drop for it still be super sudsy and lathering, so the bottle is going to last a long time. It feels powerful but gentle at the same time, and it smells so good. Please never stop making this product!",

Started to notice my skin drying out significantly around my cheeks, tip of nose, and under facial hair.Found this product mentioned on a few reviews online, and since I started using this face wash, I haven't had a problem with dry skin at all. Great, slightly citric smell, and very little is required to clean my face. Doesn't lather as much as I expected, but it works well and has kept my skin clean and blemish free, without drying out my face. I've had the same bottle for a couple of years now, and still have about a quarter left! Great purchase, and when I run low I'll be ordering more",
