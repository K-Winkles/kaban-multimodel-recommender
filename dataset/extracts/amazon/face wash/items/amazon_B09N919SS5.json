                "reviewText": "So I started using this product as soon as I received it on 9/18/23. When I first got it, I noticed a difference from cleansers here on the American market. It doesn't have a strong order at all, super clear with green tint, soft on skin and leaves skin soft and hydrated. I've never used makeup since my skin is super sensitive but I always had little bumps that weren't quite pimples on my forehead and just like everyone else, blackheads on my nose. I've have a noticable difference in my face since I started using this. I was not using this with a combination of any other product. I was literally starting my skin care journey.I only use it once a day at night to clean off all the dirt and oil I've accumulated on my skin throughout the day and than after cleaning my face with the cleanser, I put a sensitive skin moisturizer after. And in the morning I washed my face with regular bar soap.I love this product so much. I will continue to buy it and I recommend it to people, who just like me, didn't know where to start with a skin care routine and was. being bombarded by social media with a million different products. Funny thing is, I didn't find this on social media. Found it searching on Amazon and reading reviews lol.",
