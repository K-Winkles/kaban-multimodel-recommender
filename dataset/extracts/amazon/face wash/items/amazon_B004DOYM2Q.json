They may not be for everyone, but they do work for some. I never really had issues with breakouts, so it was hard to find products to work for my daughter. We tried lots (some $, others $$$), and now we found a product to stick with! Again, not suitable for all skin types, but if you've tried everything else, give this a shot!",
