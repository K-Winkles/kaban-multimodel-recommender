I love Aveeno products anyway so took a chance on this. It came with 2 bottles. The texture of the cleanser is absolutely fabulous so I take my time washing my face in a circular motion just to feel it. I follow it with Aveeno facial scrub which also is really nice. They both make my face feel very smooth. My night time regimen is completed with snail face and eye cream. Dang, the next day my face feels like a newborn baby. I used to use Aveeno Blackberry cleanser but very unfortunately it has been discontinued other than on Amazon but sellers overprice it big time. These new cleaners I use now by Aveeno definitely make up for the blackberry cleanser loss. I highly recommend the 2 mentioned above\ud83d\udc4c.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this cleanser for just over two weeks. So far I really like it. It cleanses gently without stripping the skin, and I like that it\u2019s fragrance free and doesn\u2019t contain niacinamide.The only downside is that it seems I have to use a lot or wash my face twice for my skin to feel clean enough. I\u2019ve also noticed that if I don\u2019t double cleanser everyday, that my skin feels more congested. I do have oily skin though so perhaps that\u2019s why.Overall I think that for the price this cleanser is a good option. You may just need to use more/buy it more frequently if you have oily, acne prone skin like mine.",
