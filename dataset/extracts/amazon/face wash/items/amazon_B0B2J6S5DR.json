This cleanser works better than any I\u2019ve ever tried, including top of the line, very high-end ones from fancy department stores. I use it AFTER using Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, which I thought did a good job of removing the minimal amount of powder makeup I use. But, using this cleanser, I still remove more makeup! It\u2019s not abrasive, but my face actually glows, after using it. My skin is totally free of makeup and is left feeling extremely clean, soft and smooth. And, no toner is needed, afterwords.",
