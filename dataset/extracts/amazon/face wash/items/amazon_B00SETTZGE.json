I took the plunge because I was tired of dealing with cheaper brands and was finally looking for a good, adult product. I like my decision with this. It has a slight smell, but it's pleasant. There are exfoliating beads that make me feel like it's doing extra work on my behalf. The 8 oz bottle lasts me for months and I only use a small dollop a day. I'm going to be sticking with this product for the foreseeable future.",

                "reviewText": "How to review this product and compete with all of the witty and rather clever reviews.... Heck, after reading the reviews on this product, I was half-way convinced this product would change my life. Most of the reviews were compensated and if they were unhappy, they still made waiver statements as though a lawyer coached them.Now, I want to start by saying I waited a little more than a week to write a review because my first impression was to pack this stuff back up and send it back. After a few days of use, I changed my view because what are we talking about here? It's a face wash.Does it clean? Yup.Does your skin feel decent after use? You betcha.After using this product, do you wake up in a mansion with the title \"Supermodel Rock Star\"? Not a chance, but don't expect that from a bottle of face wash....The bottle is very cheap and due to the density of the product, you will have to pump the dispenser incessantly to prime it enough to actually work. There isn't a strong scent and it's not distinctive by any means. The \"exfoliate\" portion refers to the not so \"micro-rocks\" that do scrub per say, but are not in high enough quantities to do much of anything. You basically just push them around on your face and seem like ingredients to hype the label, not functionality. Speaking of the label, I feel as though the label is well marketed to appeal to all. \"Organic ingredients, foaming exfoliator, fuel.\" Yeah it has those ingredients and they make sure to spell it out all over the label, but they seem to be more of an advertisement. Just didn't get the result that was claimed.Overall, it's a nice soap, but I think it's priced much too high. I purchased for about half the retail price and I feel that's still too high. It's new, so you're not paying for the name and clearly it wasn't spent on the bottle. I will not be purchasing an additional bottle, even with the advertised discount for a good review, but I'll finish the one I have as it still does its job...it cleans.",
