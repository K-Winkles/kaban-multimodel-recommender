                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for a few weeks now. You don't need a whole lot and you'll have to wet your face first, then use a pea size to clean your face. I like that it makes my face feel fresh and smooth. Also, it has no smell so nothing overpowering. I am happy with my purchased and my skin is looking nice since using this product. The size of this cleanser is a bit smaller than any usual store bought product so it is a bit disappointing and that is one downside imo; despite being a good product, I feel that it's a bit pricey for the size.",
