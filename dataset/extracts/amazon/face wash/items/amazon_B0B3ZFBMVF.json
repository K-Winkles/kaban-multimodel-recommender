I got these for a great price on Prime Day. It is gentle and does not leave my skin feeling stripped. I typically do a double cleanse, and use a balm cleanser prior to this. I cannot comment on how well it removes makeup as a first cleanse, but works great as a second cleanse. I use it to wash my hands a lot because I find it's less drying than most hand soaps. Overall, a great purchase that I will continue to re-buy in the future.",

Since I started using it, I have noticed a noticeable improvement in the hydration of my skin.What I like most is how it gently cleanses my face without leaving residue or that dry feeling that other cleansers usually leave. Although it does not have a scent, I consider it an advantage, since there are no fragrances that can irritate the skin.The formula with hyaluronic acid is excellent; I feel like my skin is revitalized with every wash. It effectively removes impurities without compromising my skin's natural hydration, something I greatly value.Plus, its softness makes it ideal even for my sensitive skin, which is a big plus.In short, this Neutrogena cleanser with hyaluronic acid has become a must-have in my daily routine. If you're looking for a cleanser that leaves no residue and provides that extra hydration without added fragrance, I definitely recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this for a week so far , twice a day now with the matching hydroboost moisturizer and it\u2019s absolutely amazing! I had issues with dry skin and one use and not only was the dry skin gone but my face is so much smoother and softer and has a bit of a glow to it! There\u2019s a slight smell to it, kind of like a basic soap smell. And I only wish it was a bit thicker and had a bit of color to it, to make it easier to not use way too much on accident. But regardless, I would 100% recommend this either just on its own or with the matching moisturizer!",

I feel like this product does a great job as a replacement since it feels refreshing and has similar cleansing properties to Cerave. It also is good for sensitive skin as I didn't feel any burning sensations as I've had with other facial cleansers.",

Which some facial washes make you feel dry and tight, this one helps your skin breathe, (my skin and opinion obviously) But if you've got sensitive skin, I PROMISE you will love this. It's worth the price, lasts me at least a month (with washing twice a day), get it!!!",
