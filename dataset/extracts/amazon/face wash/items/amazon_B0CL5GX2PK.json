He deals with dry skin, so finding a product that doesn't create an adverse reaction is always good.The cleanser is clear and provides a rich sudsy lather. It's predominantly fragrance free, but not totally. I went to smell it while it was in the tube, and I detected a very faint scent of some sort. It basically smelled like your typical cleanser, but very muted. I don't think it would affect anyone with sensitivities to smells, but everyone is different, so that could vary. However, after washing off the cleanser, no scent was detected on the skin.In all honesty, I think that this face wash could be used by both male and female. Regardless, it seems to be working for my husband, and it seems to do a great job of serving its primary purpose.",
