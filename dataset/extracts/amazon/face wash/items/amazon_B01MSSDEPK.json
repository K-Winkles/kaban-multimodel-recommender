                "reviewText": "The CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser has become a staple in my skincare routine, and for good reason. This non-foaming face wash has proven to be a game-changer in maintaining my skin's health and hydration.What sets this cleanser apart is its gentle and moisturizing formula. It doesn't strip the skin of its natural oils or leave it feeling tight and dry like some other cleansers. Instead, it effectively removes dirt, makeup, and impurities while providing a boost of hydration.The key ingredients, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and glycerin, work harmoniously to lock in moisture and strengthen the skin's natural barrier. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall appearance since incorporating this cleanser into my daily regimen.Fragrance-free and paraben-free, this cleanser is suitable for even the most sensitive skin types. It doesn't irritate or cause any adverse reactions, making it a reliable choice for those with delicate or reactive skin.The generously-sized 16-fluid ounce bottle ensures that a little goes a long way, making it an economical option that lasts for months.I particularly appreciate the practical pump dispenser, as it makes the application mess-free and convenient, especially during my morning rush.After each use, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and comfortably hydrated, ready to absorb the benefits of the following skincare steps. It has also contributed to reducing occasional breakouts, leaving me with a clearer and more radiant complexion.CeraVe is a brand known for its dermatologist-recommended products, and this facial cleanser is no exception. It has earned my trust with its science-backed formulation and the positive impact it has had on my skin's health.In conclusion, the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is a top-notch product that lives up to its promises.

I haven't used it every day or regularly as I should, but it helps when I use it even just once. It kills the itch a bit and makes me feel clean and fresh faced. It's not super moisturizing as I feel pretty dry after I use it but I can't complain too much. Many moisturizers can make the flaking worse.I wish it lathered up a little but I know that lathering means next to nothing when it comes to most soaps, so it's not a big deal. Smell is very light to unnoticeable and doesn't linger so that's nice too. For the price, can't beat it!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Skincare Staple For a Reason",
                "reviewText": "I keep coming back to this unassuming cleanser every time my skin gets the winter blues. For reference:I have oily, combination, with dry patches (overusing tretinoin 0.1) skin and I love heavy skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don\u2019t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. So I use Embryolisse lait cr\u00e8me concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as I felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault I\u2019ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so I started switching to gentler products, taking a page from French skincare routine, the gentler and simpler\u2014the better.I randomly picked this cleanser because it\u2019s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. I tried it for a few days and I HATED it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. So I did with it what I did with other hated products\u2014I put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. But, after a year or so I decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from YouTube derms. And I decided to actually give it a try. Because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately.After trying a few weeks I loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. It would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. My skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like Sahara Desert. It really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that I know my skin can use during the colder months. I never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. It soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight.The only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn\u2019t remove makeup, I use doable-cleansing always so it doesn\u2019t bother me. I usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so I can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. I\u2019m used to it now not lathering and I\u2019m fine with it. You can massage you face while you\u2019re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it\u2019s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. I\u2019m a convert believer!",

I cleanse my face, dab it dry and then apply a good moisturiser that suits my skin type and sometimes a serum(vitamin e or niacin amide) and top it off with a good sunscreen in the morning and the same at night without the sunscreen. I started seeing results within 2 months and since 2021, I've not had an acne breakout as I did, every few weeks.However now this product is available in India at cheaper cost. You'll find it at every Apollo pharmacy outlet and many other stores, check out their website for updated price.
