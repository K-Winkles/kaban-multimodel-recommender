                "reviewText": "This works great and will last if you know how to take care of it and have managed expectations. Here are my thoughts as a first time user...Effectiveness - I have very sensitive skin with congested pores that's prone to nodular cystic acne, blackheads and white heads. So far, this has reduced potential breakouts and evened out the texture of my skin! After one use I noticed smoother skin and nearly zero blackheads! Some reviews say they didn't notice a difference and I think that depends on thick your cleanser is, which can act like a lubricant that keeps the bristles from making full contact with your skin? I've used it with and without soap - it's definitely better WITHOUT soap if you want a deep exfoliation and glow!!Bristles - they're rigid enough to feel like they're doing something yet soft enough for sensitive skin. Some wished the bristles were firmer, but I think it would be too aggressive for everyday use and could cause more damage than good. I've been to several dermatologists and many cautioned me about over exfoliating manually (brushes, facecloth), saying it can cause micro tears in your skin for bacteria to go into or strip the skin of natural oils. Both of which cause more breakouts. I found the bristles to work well slightly damp, without soap, at buffing off dead skin gently and removing blackheads from my jawline and nose.Cleaning - reviewers that are disappointed that it doesn't remove a full face of makeup don't realize they have to take their makeup off FIRST with wipes or makeup remover. If you don't then you'll just be smearing makeup all over your face no matter how much soap you use. It did a good job getting the last trace of stubborn foundation off for me. I pulled off the brush head and cleaned it with soap after every use to make sure no makeup or skin was left behind and air dried thoroughly to keep it from getting mildew. I mean, what's the point in cleaning your face with dirty tools?Rotation - No, it doesn't spin fast but it does have TORQUE, meaning it doesn't come to a full stop when brush is pushed against the face. If it spun faster then it would skip off your face or fling soap everywhere! I soaped up my face first before using the brush to get even coverage versus putting soap on the brush. There's a learning curve to the movement pattern you use to get the best results. Sometimes moving it slowly side to side feels like it's working deeper.Battery/Defective device - I've only had my device for a week so I can't speak to its longevity but I make sure it NEVER TOUCHES WATER! The battery housing doesn't seem secure enough to seal out moisture? It says it's water resistant but I wouldn't use this in the shower. It comes with generic brand batteries but I used Energizer or Duracell Max to ensure power and life. At $19 for what I paid, it is pricey if it only lasts a few months but I'm hoping to get at least a year of daily use out of it if I keep it dry and don't drop it!Overall - it's definitely a game changer for me and I wished I had gotten this sooner! Sure, it could be more powerful, have more attachment options and be waterproof but at this price, it is what it is and gets the job done without using acid peels!",

                "reviewText": "I had an earlier version of this brush decades ago and when it finally died, I just forgot about it, I guess. I don't know what took me so long to replace it, but when I recently ran across it online it was ADD TO CART immediately. How did I go so long w/o it? I use it about 3 times a week, keep it in the shower, and do a double-cleanse with my regular face wash. It lathers up well with my foaming cleanser and is easy to clean afterward - simply pop off the brush head and rinse well, then reattach. It comes with an extra brush head, but it takes a really long time to wear one out. I can feel how \"extra\" clean my skin is after using this, more so than when I just do a regular face wash. I've had no issues with it at all - runs well, just pop in the batteries and you're good to go. Great product for a reasonable price. Olay is a great company and I enjoy using many of their cleansers/creams.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had an Olay brush for years before it decided to fall and die on me. Bought a cheap drug store replacement and said never again as the quality was just poor and stopped working after a couple months. Purchased this Olay brush during Black Friday when then price dropped to less that $20. This brush, just as the previous one I owned, is amazing. Brush bristles are sturdy and you can feel the deep clean without your skin feeling dry or striped afterward. Also, Olay brushes have never negatively impacted my super sensitive, sometimes acne prone skin. It does come with replacement brush heads as well and with proper care and usage should last you years to come!",

A good skincare routine is so important, even at this age. ;)",
