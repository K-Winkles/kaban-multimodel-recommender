I've watched the price go from $3.99 in the early part of the 21st century to $6.99 in 2021 to $9.99 now for a 7 oz. tube. Since inflation reared its ugly head the stuff is not worth the price. The primary ingredient is water and I'm reasonably convinced that water has not increased in price to that same extent. I'm one of those old suckers who just hates getting messed with. Jacking up the price by 40% because our government wants to flood the market with \"free money\" just doesn't cut it.The Amazon scrub is effective, does not dry out my old tired skin and the smell - though not great - is not offensive. I would strongly recommend this product.",

Post-cleaning, my skin felt so much cleaner, smoother and less lizard-like. I was very happy about the slight grittiness of the scrub. The scrub was effective and left my skin feeling much improved. It will take another round to finish the cleanse before I go on a maintenance routine, but the improvements from the initial round of my new regimen are good.",
