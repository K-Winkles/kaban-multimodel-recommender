                "reviewText": "First, this is the only sensitive face cleanser that I can use. I have Rosacea and nothing else is better for it than this cleanser - the FOAM CLEANSER THAT IS. Why? Because the ordinary pump cleanser from Citaphil has propylene glycol in it. For some reason, that ingredient is not in the foam dispenser. The propylene glycol is a really bad ingredient to be used in anything, and it really does make my face worse and I will not use it. Second, I, like many of you HATED the foam pump because it just was super hard to use. You had to pull it back out of the bottle every time you pumped down because it got stuck. What a pain in the caboose it was! But I had no choice but to buy it again and just live with the problem. SO HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS! I got my new order in today and the foam pump works beautifully. The older bottle had a blue pump and the new one is white. So I said the pump is fixed and I am just hoping it pumps beautifully all the way to the last drop and doesn't make a liar out of me.",
