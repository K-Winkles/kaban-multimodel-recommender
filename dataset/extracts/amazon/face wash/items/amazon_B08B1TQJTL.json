I normally use L'Oreal men's charcoal, but thought I'd try something different and more natural. When I saw this listing I was interested and bought it, but ended up not being impressed vs the L'Oreal charcoal.Seeing this face wash isn't soap-based, it stays creamy while rubbing my hands around my face and forehead, causing it to eventually start to absorb like the way lotions do. Once I dry myself after getting out of the shower, my face and forehead feel overly moist, while the L'Oreal makes me feel more clean, smooth, and firm. Lastly, my face and forehead end up producing a lot of oil and grease all over again, while the L'Oreal helps prevent buildup in a short period.I was expecting a lemon oil-based face wash to have my face and forehead feeling clean, fresh, firm, and smooth without much oil buildup after usage. And I wasn't expecting this item to have a texture more like a lotion.",
