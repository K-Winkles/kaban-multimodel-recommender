I have noticed it's not as effective at cleaning my pores so once or twice a week before bed I will use either Thayers Rose Petal or Glycolic & Lactic Acids toner & that does the trick.

Over the past few years I've started needing some toning and moisturization to keep my skin smooth, and I've tried a lot of things. Most of them are too oily for me, and some of the good oil-free moisturizers are very expensive. Just by chance I ran across Thayers snow mushroom toner, and being big on the benefits of mushrooms, I decided to try it. This product is all I need after cleansing. Don't let the word \"toner\" fool you, because it also has hyaluronic acid for moisturization. It leaves my skin toned, smooth, and moist without oiliness, and it lasts all day. (I think it is shrinking my eye bags.) My all-in-one solution, and economical! I wish I had found it before wasting all that money trying dozens of different products.",

I tried on damp skin, on mostly dry skin. Tried using more, tried using less. The results were always the same for me, my skin just felt sticky and like it needed washed again. I had better results using at night before bed. Usual make up removing, washing face, pat dry, apply toner. Then let it dry and wait for the stickiness to subside before applying serums and finally a moisturizer. There was always some stickiness left behind that just felt uncomfortable to me. It's Thayers so I'm sure it's a great product for some, it's just not meant for me.",

Because the first bottle is almost gone, and I have found that my face looks smoother and well moisturized. I can recommend that it can be used to smooth and moisturize arms, legs, chest. Any exposed skin that I want to look fresher, younger. No annoying scent. My daughters wedding recently took place, and I was told by her cousin whom I have not seen for years, that I looked \"stunning\". Skin care products matter! I have been around a long time, and have tried many different products. This one really works.",

Leaves my skin feeling 10000000000x more moisturized and smooth and silky using this one and washing it off compared to the other, and the smell of this one just smells so much nicer too being creamy unlike the rubbery plastic smell of the aloe cleanser.No idea if one has different benefits over the other since the other is labeled as pH balancing and this one isnt so I use both, aloe one in the morning with witch hazel tonic and snow mushroom cleanser and toner at night but if I had to chose between the two definitely this one in my books.",
