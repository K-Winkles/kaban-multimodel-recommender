                "reviewText": "This cream cleanser is the best. I actually use a facial scrub first, and then use this as a second wash. Leave it on for at least a minute and let it do its work. The menthol really opens up your pores. The moisturizers in the cream leave your skin feeling really soft. I shave in the shower. I use a regular shaving gel for a first shave, use this product to wash my face, and then do a second shave with this product still on my face. The menthol helps the hairs stick up just that much more so you can get a really close shave. You could even use this product as a primary shaving cream. Just make sure to leave it on for a minute first so that it can clean your face like it's supposed to.",
