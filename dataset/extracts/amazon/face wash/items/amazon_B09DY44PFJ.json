I find that it works best if i emulsify it between my hands until i get a foam. The thick gel texture can roll off your hands if your not careful. It takes a lot of water to wash off.I don't like the bottle because it's hard to open. I actually got a little scrape on my finger from opening the bottle everyday.The smell is nice and light. It leaves my face feeling clean. It's a relatively small bottle.",

I wanted to like this as it lathered nice with such a small amount. My negative symptoms improved after I discontinued. I used nothing else new during this period so it was definitely this :(",
