                "reviewText": "I've been using the Vitamin C & Retinol Serums the Retinol Moisturizer and the Vitamin C Cleanser since January 2018. I am iNsAnE about these products!I am 54 and according to my husband (who also uses the same products and looks FABULOUSLY younger) now look 44. My skin is smoother, brighter, tighter and fresher looking!I wash with the Vitamin C cleanser in the morning and then apply the Vitamin C serum. I use it all over my neck (including the sides), my chest and tops of my shoulders. At night I wash again with the cleanser and apply the Retinol serum the same way and once it dries I apply the Retinol moisturizer. I only use the moisturizer maybe twice per week at night because honestly, the wash and the serums alone have done so much for my complexion I don't feel I really need it every night.I would like to add a little background on myself and how I came to use these products...2 years ago I started following The Primal Blueprint because I wasn't taking care of myself like I should have. I was always very thin (5' 7\" and around 120 lbs.) but started eating all the wrong foods and skyrocketed to 154 lbs. I felt horrible about myself. My skin was looking awful and I felt I was aging way before my time.Years of being a sun lover was starting to show in a really bad way with deep lines down the center of my chest and I was always really red (which I later learned was due to inflammation from eating all the wrong foods) on my chest and neck area. My face was looking old, my hair was looking bad and I just felt all around crappy about myself.So I knew I needed to make some changes, fast! I searched for an answer and came across Mark Sisson and his Primal Blueprint.I purchased several of his cookbooks and 1 week later I went Primal. I purged my kitchen cabinets of $200 worth of groceries I had just purchased and started my new life. Long story short, I lost 36 lbs. in about 5 months and now weigh 119 lbs. Instead of junior's size L/XL (size 14-16) I wear juniors size XS (0-2)! The transformation not only in my weight/size but overall general appearance is REMARKABLE!Every wrinkle on my chest, sides of my neck and tops of my shoulders, from sun damage, DISAPPEARED because the thickness of my skin has completely changed with the loss of so much fat. Along with the fat went the ugly sun damage/deep wrinkles!The skin over my entire body has completely changed from dry in some areas, oily in others, wrinkly, sun damaged, ruddy, thick and inflamed to baby smooth from top to bottom and sun damage free! It's truly astounding what a change in diet can do for your skin and overall appearance!As for my hair? When I started the Primal way of life my hair was dull and lifeless and WAS NOT GROWING AT ALL! It was several inches above my shoulders and now it's growing like crazy and is almost down to the middle of my bad. Not only does it grow like crazy but it's thicker and shinier and sheds 99% less.I should add that along with the Primal way of life for 2 years I have also been taking Brain Power Omega-3 Fish Oil for 2 years which I purchase every 90 days here on Amazon and believe much of my overall improvements are a direct result. Living a natural and organic lifestyle has done more for me than I could ever write about here. It was THE BEST THING I have ever done for myself. Everything in my life is organic down to my mascara, the products I clean with and even my mattress! I was just missing one thing....a natural/organic skincare regimen. The one final thing to take the improvements in my skin and make them even better!So here I am reviewing these InstaNatural products which I have to say have only added to and enhanced the wonderful changes that had already taken place in my life.I research EVERYTHING I purchase now and have become a serious ingredients label reader. It's incredibly time consuming but in the end it's worth it. I looked at numerous natural skin care lines here on Amazon and in the end I chose InstaNaturals. After using these products for only 2 months, the improvements in my complexion are SO INCREDIBLE & SO OBVIOUS, I will NEVER use anything else! ( ( I pray they never stop making this stuff).My husband tells me at least 10x a day how great I look and how I have reversed my age and how he can't believe the changes but the other day he said something that I will never forget. He looked at me and said...\"You look so good you're actually starting to scare me!\"Ladies, if you're thinking about purchasing a new skin care regimen, STOP HERE and try InstaNatural's line of Vitamin C and Retinol. I promise you will not regret it but I need to reiterate that, for me personally, my skin and overall appearance improvements have only improved because of a combination of things. I believe that had I started using this skin care line back when I was eating a horrible diet, it would not have made a difference in my face.You must take care of yourself all around, not just the outside, and that means eating the right foods. Stop putting poisons in your body with the foods you eat. Put the right things in your body and the results will show on the outside. Once you do that, everything you add to your exterior will only enhance your overall health. An overall healthy appearance starts from the inside NOT with what you put on your face!I will purchase these InstaNatural products for life. In fact, Because I use these products on my neck, chest and shoulder as well as my face I will probably reorder more frequently. It is money very well spent. So THANK YOU INSTANATURALS for the MOST AMAZING products ever! I love you but most importantly I love me!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, and I must say that the product itself is outstanding. However, I'd like to mention a minor downside, which is the packaging.Let's start with the positives. This facial cleanser has become an essential part of my daily skincare routine. It's enriched with vitamin C, a potent antioxidant known for its skin brightening and rejuvenating properties. After using it consistently, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall radiance. My complexion looks more even, and my skin feels refreshed and revitalized.The formula is gentle yet effective, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin like mine. It effectively removes makeup, dirt, and impurities without leaving my skin feeling tight or dry. Instead, it leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated, which is a rare combination for a facial cleanser.Now, about the packaging\u2014this is where the product could see some improvement. The cleanser comes in a plastic bottle with a flip-top cap. While the cap is convenient for dispensing the product, I've noticed that it can sometimes be a bit messy. The cleanser has a somewhat runny consistency, so it can easily drip down the bottle, causing some product wastage and making the bottle quite slippery. Additionally, I found it challenging to control the amount of product dispensed, and sometimes I ended up with more than I needed.Despite the minor packaging inconvenience, I can't stress enough how much I love the product itself. It's a skincare gem that has genuinely improved the look and feel of my skin. I've seen a noticeable reduction in blemishes and improved skin clarity since incorporating it into my routine.The InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Cleanser is a fantastic product that delivers on its promises. If you're looking for a cleanser that brightens and rejuvenates your skin while keeping it soft and hydrated, this is a great choice. Just be aware that the packaging could use some refinement for a more convenient and mess-free application. Nonetheless, don't let the packaging deter you from trying this wonderful cleanser\u2014it's definitely worth it for the results it delivers.",

                "reviewText": "I was never one for a skincare routine outside of washing my face with a wash cloth. I never believed that skincare products were good because they would be full of chemicals and things to make your skin worse not better. I told myself unless it was a natural, gentle, and well reviewed I wouldn't even consider buying it. Skincare lines are expensive so I wanted to make sure it was money well spent.I've been using the InstaNatural skincare line for about a few months now every day. and it's made a huge different to my face. My dull dry skin is soft, smooth, and most of all moisturized. I have that glowing skin I used to have as a child again and the dark circles/bags under my eyes are slowly fading away. It's like I look 10 years younger. The citrus smell is refreshing and all the products are very gentle and never irritated my skin. I highly recommended this.",

I wanted to give my skin a rest from a product which takes the top layers of skin off and therefore makes you more prone to UV.I\u2019d read about this and it seemed well reviewed so now on my 3rd bottle. Lovely citrus smell and lathers up nicely. Face looks and feels fresh without making it more susceptible to UV rays using resurfacing anti ageing products like Elemis. Complexion seems brighter too. Ideal for summer when the sun is out may switch back to Elemis in the winter!",

There were plenty of really positive comments, some of wich did apparently got the products sent for testing, but however I purchased the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, the Retinol Moisturizer and the Vitam C serum.The package was here rather quickly and I tried the products the same day.The Vitamin C Facial Cleanser: it has a really nice texture and a neutral smell, it cleans really soft and nice, leaves the skin really smooth. The Vitamin C serum applies really easy and I personally like the smell a lot, it smells fresh but like nothing I know. My skin was glowing and it dried really easy and nice on my skin.The moisturizer is also really nice, the smell is different and I had to get used to it, but when I apply it, my skin is super soft and nice, not greasy at all!I am really really happy with these three products and will definitely buy all of them again!I'm using the products for a little over three months now, and my skin has never been softer and moister without being or getting greasy!",
