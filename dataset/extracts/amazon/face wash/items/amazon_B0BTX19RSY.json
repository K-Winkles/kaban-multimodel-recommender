I would accompany this with a facial scrub because there really isnt any pore-purifying action. Just a light cleanse.Leaves skin feeling soft and supple, I use a silicone scrubber to massage it onto my face otherwise the cleanser would just smooth off.Consistency: Transclucent white feels like pudding.",

I like looking for a cleaner that not only cleans well but doesn't make my face feel dry for the night after using it.Quality/Scent:I usually use face wash in the shower or in the morning. This product basically has no scent to it at all. It lathers a very tiny bit but not much at all. It goes on pretty easily and doesn't leave any residue once you wash it off. It also doesn't make my skin feel irritated or anything.Overall, a very basic product but gets the job done.",
