This charcoal face wash effectively cleanses and purifies the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and revitalized.The charcoal formulation in this face wash is excellent for drawing out impurities and excess oil from the skin. It helps to unclog pores and remove dirt and grime, resulting in a deep clean sensation. The face wash has a lightweight and foaming texture that spreads easily on the skin, making it a pleasure to use. I purchased it for my husband, but I now use it!",
