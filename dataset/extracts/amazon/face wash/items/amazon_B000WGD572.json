GET THE CLEANSER! it\u2019s awesome!",

                "reviewText": "I have used Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel since the 1990's and have been very disappointed in how it has risen in price so drastically through the years. It is unfortunately to the point now where it's almost unaffordable, at least for me. I love it because it's so gentle and leaves no residue on your face. I use it not only to cleanse my face but as a shaving gel as well (I don't like shaving creams/foams). Your razor glides SO effortlessly across your face with this gel. I love it, always have, but I'm afraid it may be time to move onto something a little more affordable now.",
