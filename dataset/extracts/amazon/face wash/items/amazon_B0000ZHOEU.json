That\u2019s not to say this is more drying - that wouldn\u2019t be fair and not entirely accurate. It simply leaves the skin clean without drying, without increased sensitivity without redness or any other issues. I\u2019ve been through the Cetaphil, Ceravae and La Roche Posay families. They just never lived up to the hype. Here - less is more and in this case - much more. Great foaming action. Mild, if any, scent. No burning. No drying. No irritation. Leaves the skin in its most neutral state such that if you want to layer products on after that? You be you. But, you will not find a more solid cleanser than this. This needs a greater shout out than it currently gets.",

When I say everything I mean literally everything you can buy on the store shelves. After the last soap I used left me with a huge rash on both of my cheeks, I ended up at the dermatologist. While I was there she gave me a huge goody bag all kinds of soaps to try that were for sensitive skin. None of them worked except this brand. This is now my new go-to soap for my face but you can literally use it all over. In my opinion this is the best soap for sensitive skin on the market today.",

                "reviewText": "Recently diagnosed with Eczema, I've been on a non-stop mission to find 'all things non-irrating' to replace all my personal and household products which aggravate my eczema. This said it's suitable for \"hands, face and body\", and is free of a whole bunch of common irritants and is fragrance-free so I gave it a try. I bought one for my bathroom sink and one for the kitchen sink, and will probably add it to my shower too if I can't find a suitable body wash. It makes my hands feel nice and clean: not stripped but not moisturized from extra crap, just CLEAN. I almost forgot what plain ol' clean feels like because most hand soaps have added garbage that moisturize, exfoliate, etc. This does nothing fancy, it just gives you an honest, simple clean.I washed my face with it and I always have to moisturize immediately afterward because my skin is very dry, but just for the sake of testing this product, I didn't moisturize right away. My skin didn't have that tight and itchy feeling, which was refreshing indeed. I do still need to moisturize my face, but my test showed that it's at least not harsh in any way. It has a nice lather, semi-low lathering but still enough to satisfy the senses and feels silky in the hands.My only complaint is the price. These are small bottles. There is a larger refill bottle but I still feel it's a bit on the pricey side in my opinion. I will continue to buy it, but like I said above, if I can find a less expensive eczema-friendly product for body wash I will, and reserve this for face and hands. On the plus side, a little goes a long way, I only need a very small amount for hand washing, not a full pump - maybe not even half a pump, so that helps take the some of the sting out of the price. Overall I'm very happy with this so far and I think my poor, irritated skin will thank me.",

                "reviewText": "I used this for hand wash in my bathroom and it is really cleansing but very gentle and doesn\u2019t strip the moisture from your skin. I\u2019m going to buy a refill bottle soon to keep it in my bathroom regularly. I\u2019m glad there\u2019s a refill option because I don\u2019t like recycling lots of small bottles.",
