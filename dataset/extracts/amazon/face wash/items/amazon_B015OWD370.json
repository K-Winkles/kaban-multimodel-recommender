                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this face wash for 4-5 years and have been really happy with it. I\u2019m able to get all my makeup off and get my faces cleaned in one step. I finish it off with my Greek oil and my face is feeling clean and refreshed. The only fault I give is that if I don\u2019t use my Greek oil after it does leave my skin feeling a little dry. But I think that\u2019s just how it goes with face wash and for me personally I like to make sure my face is nice and clean and replenish with natural oil.",
