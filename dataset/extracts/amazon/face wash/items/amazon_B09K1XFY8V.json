Fortunately I found Tailorford! It cleans well, easy to rinse off, and got rid of the acne problem. It actually does minimize the appearance of your pores. My skin looks and feels fantastic and I haven't yet tried their moisturizer. I will definitely be buying Tailorford facewash again.",

This face wash has a pleasant and mild citrus scent which is a huge plus. It lathers nicely and I can feel how much cleaner my face is after I use it.My skin reacted to other skin care products in the past but this face wash doesn\u2019t dry out my skin at all. I\u2019ve been using this face wash once in the morning and once at night, followed by the Tailorford moisturizer. My skin is glowing and my friends have complimented how much better my skin looks vs my previous skin care routine. I highly recommend checking out the moisturizer too.",
