Winter weather plus retinoids have made my skin parched and flaky. Starting my day with a cleanser that leaves a dry, \"tight\" feeling strips all of the moisture I pump into my skin overnight right out. This cleanser eliminates that issue and is gentle and moisturizing. It has a pleasing, silky skin feel and has not caused any breakouts or sensitivity issues. Switching to this cleanser and following it up with a layer of blue tansy oil from the Yellow Bird (also available on amazon) has actually eliminated dry patches on my skin and restored a healthy glow.",

                "reviewText": "I have very dry, sensitive skin and this oil cleanser leaves my face, neck and decolletage clean, soft and moisturized. It makes a pleasant, light, bubbly lather and is fragrance-free (a must for me). It's a great value since the price point is very affordable and it only takes one pump for me to clean the areas I mentioned above. I'm happy with my purchase and will repurchase it as needed!!!",

                "reviewText": "The item arrived damaged with the pump nozzle broken off but I am still able to use it so I deducted a star. I had been wanting to try this product for some time and am a fan of the other CeraVe products (toners, cleansers, miceller water, etc.). This product wasn't *quite* as moisturizing as I was expecting (I guess the oil part made me think it would be ultra hydrating), but it did leave my skin feeling cleansed and not tight at all (a feeling I hate). It did a good job removing eye makeup and when I toned after I cleansed I didn't pick up any obvious traces of leftover foundation. Overall, my face felt nice after using this product and I will continue to use it. I would recommend this item 9/10.",

                "reviewText": "I saw some European vloggers show this product, and hoped it would work well as a first oil cleanser for me. My skin is not dry, but reactive and dehydrated, so a gentle non-stripping cleanser is a must, otherwise my skin freaks out and makes more oil. I feel like Cera Ve tried to be trendy and deliver a KBeauty inspired product for the European and North American market, but delivered a weird hybrid instead. This product is a thick and dense clear yellow gel cleanser, which was formulated to resemble oil in its consistency. It's not an oil and doesn't clean like one. It needs to be applied to wet skin and foams into creamy leather. It feels nice and is pleasant to use, doesn't sting the eyes or strip my skin. Unfortunately it's not not very effective at either dissolving or removing skin oil, make up, sunscreen, or mascara. Frustratingly, it leaves a fair amount of dirt and make up behind. I needed a second cleanser after using this one, and my skin and eyes still didn't feel as clean as when I use oil cleanser followed by a second cleanser. It might work well for someone with dry skin in the mornings, to clean the skin without stripping, but it's not great for people who use sunscreen, especially physical sunscreens or make up which is made to be water-resistant. Another issue I have with this product is the pump, which dispenses a huge amount of gel. I purchased a large bottle, and am amazed to say that after several days of use I see a considerable amount of product gone. It's not a very good value for the money.",
