                "reviewText": "I can swear by this product that it worksOkay first off it doesnt really help with my acne but it helps in getting everything off. I wear Eyeliner, and bb cream on my face. At the end of each day I squirt a little of this into my hand and rub it onto my eyes. Ive never had a problem with stinging but I never really open my eyes when washing them in the first place. Anywho it gets all of my eye makeup/concealer off very fast. Then I wash my eyes and then squirt a little more onto my hand and wash my face. It gets off the foundation quick. My face always feels soft after using this. I have sensitive skin so I am very careful with what I use. They gave this facewash a new look a few months back and I nearly panicked when I didnt see this at target anymore. Little did I know they were just making the bottle prettier also the price of it went up in stores. I usually paid 3-4 dollars but now its nearly 5 dollars. Buying on here save me a few bucks in the long run. (buying necessities with the \"super saver shipping\" policy\" Im rambling now.All in all ive been using this product for the past 3 years. It doesnt hurt my skin whatsoever and it gets off all the makeup fast. It doesnt contain any acne treating ingredients but I know its keeping my skin clean day and night.Great product also shipping from this company was very quick.",
