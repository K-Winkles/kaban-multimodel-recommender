With hormones making my acne super flared up, I needed to find a natural option for an acne product that wouldn\u2019t harm the baby and this is what was recommended online. It smells absolutely terrible (you get used to it), but it works GREAT. My acne has gotten SO much better since I became pregnant, and my skin doesn\u2019t get irritated or dried out like it did when I used to use my normal acne products (I also live at high altitude so dry skin is always an issue).I would highly recommend this product for women who are expecting, or to anyone who is looking for a more natural product to ween off the expensive acne medicines that have a ton of chemicals. Like I said, this only costs $20, and the bottle has lasted me almost 6 months now.",

I'm pretty sure this product doesn't break me out, but it also isn't a miracle treatment for my acne. My only real gripe is it comes in plastic packaging. I would pay an upcharge to get sustainable packaging. Overall, I'm pretty sure I would purchase this again.",

And 3) it is still soothing and somewhat moisturizing to my skin. It\u2019s not the best in the moisture department, but I still give 5 stars for the other benefits. I am a mid-30s mother with sensitive skin and this \u201cgreen and clean\u201d cleanser has done its job well.",
