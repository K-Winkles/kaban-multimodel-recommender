                "reviewText": "I have oily skin and it\u2019s usually more in the \u201cT zone\u201d area. I noticed that when I switched to this product It caused my skin to get more oily and it always looked as if I was sweating. Didnt really like that but it did help with getting rid of and maintaining my acne. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t the best under the chin/neck area but on my face it was great. Didn\u2019t do much for my blackheads if anything at all I would find other products to do that for you if that\u2019s part of your needs. My skin did look great tho but it\u2019s didn\u2019t feel smooth a little bumpy but it clears the acne well. Overall as an oily skin type person I think I\u2019ll be switching back to the sa cleanser as it was more beneficial to me.NOTE: more towards the oily skin typePeople and at the end of the day this is my review. Never know what might not work for me May work for you!",

                "reviewText": "First off, I want to say this stuff is amazing and absolutely works (for me atleast)! I purchased this because I was struggling with really bad acne breakouts around where my mask sits on my face. My skin is super sensitive and has had a real hard time adjusting to wearing a mask for hours on end (#teacherlife). Second thing I have to say about this product is, I do not use this every day or all over my face. I tend to use this as a spot treatment and only wash the problem areas once or twice a week-usually in the evenings. When I tried using it more than 1-2 times a week it did start to dry out my face, so keep that in mind. When I use it the next morning I can see a remarkable difference in the acne and the condition of the skin in that area as well. Usually a big reduction in the redness and a shrinkage of the acne spots that are there. Any ance the was forming under the skin has been reduced as well.WARNING! This stuff will bleach your clothes, towels, and/or washcloths. I haven't ruined any clothes yet, but I have definitely accidentally bleached a couple of my towels and washcloths because I didn't rinse it off as well as I thought I did. So be sure to rinse really, really well. To be fair though, I did expect that to happen at some point because of the Benzoyl Peroxide. I just make sure to rinse well and wear older clothing I don't mind bleaching by accident. Same thing with the towel and washcloths.Overall, it's an awesome product and I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne or is wanting to help clear up some problem areas without over drying the skin.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve purchased CeraVe\u2019s Acne Fighting Cream Cleanser with Benzoyl Perixide several times for myself & my teenage Son. I have acne prone skin I have under control but at times blackheads begin to appear on my nose. One night of applying this cleanser the next morning they\u2019re barely visible! My Son has battled acne more widespread. This has been a heaven sent for him. He cleanses his face morning & night with this & it has made a HUGE difference with his acne.There\u2019s not much battling anymore period. What was widespread is now minimal. The benzoyl peroxide truly kills any acne forming or acne that has formed on his face. His face is clearer now with little new acne forming. I knew this was a strong cleanser so we slowly introduced it to his skin. He has fairly sensitive skin so we began with once a day. Moisturizing right after is a DEFINITE! This tightens up your face which is then in need of a good moisturizer. CeraVe has 2 great moisturizers to combine with this cleanser. There is little scent to it. It comes out more watery vs. other cleansers. I/we let it sit for about 1 minute to let it truly to its job. Since this is a harsher facial ingredient I never mix it with a retinol. The 2 will create extreme dryness with irritation. I learned the hard way. A gentle moisturizer is best to use only after using this. I will use it at night only because I have a skin regime in the morning which wouldn\u2019t allow me to use this. What I love about CeraVe\u2019s product line is they come with the 3 essential ceramides, hyaluronic acid & niacinamide~2 wonderful ingredients for our skin. If you\u2019re battling acne this cleanser is definitely worth purchasing. Be aware this will leave markings on colored wash cloths & towels~ due to the benzoyl peroxide. For all this offers the price is really amazing because this 5 ounce tube/bottle does have longevity to it because you don\u2019t need much to cover your face. This doesn\u2019t foam up. With a little water it\u2019s more like a layer you apply to your skin. I see it more as a treatment for a female. This will not remove makeup ladies. I use CeraVe\u2019s Hydrating Micellar Water to cleanse my face before using this. For my Son he can get away with just using this to cleanse his face. We both have gentle silicone scrubbers to help work it into our skin. I hope my personal experience helps you decide if this is for you. A trusting name with a specific purpose. It\u2019s worth the buy!",

                "reviewText": "If you've tried other benzoyl peroxide cleansers/washes, this will probably be the best one you'll find. It is scentless unlike a lot of the panoxyl and panoxyl-clone types. It does lather a very little bit which can feel a bit nicer on the skin than some of the other non-lathering type cleansers. Importantly, does not have that chalky feel of some other benzoyl peroxide cleansers.Overall, meets the expectations you have of cerave products if you have enjoyed others from them.Works well on face as well as body. I would recommend a 4% formula like this over those high-strength 10% formulations. AFAIK and from studies/doctor recos I've seen, 10% benzoyl is NOT more effective than 4% at treating acne. 10% will be more drying and irritating for no reason.",
