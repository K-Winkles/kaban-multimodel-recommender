I have only used it twice so far so I\u2019ll update if anything changes. But I like this much better than what I was previously using which was the Clinique Take the Day off cleansing balm. It works better and is more affordable.",

                "reviewText": "After much resistance, I\u2019m a total convert to the double cleanse. Using a cleansing balm, like G&S, removes my daily SPF and keeps the next step (regular cleanser) from overstripping my skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier. My skin no longer feels dry & tight after double cleansing.Love the amount of product you get here for the price. One jar lasted me almost 3 months. No blurry eyes or breakouts or irritation after using it.Comparing it to more expensive cleansing balms I\u2019ve tried, it doesn\u2019t rinse off quite as well & no scent (I do enjoy a subtle luxurious fragrance to my skincare as part of the overall experience), but it works well as part of a double cleanse and is a great value. If you\u2019re searching for an affordable effective cleansing balm, look no further.",

It does not get milky when water is added and remains highly moisturized even after thorough rinsing. It is a good first cleanse and you could be done at that if you like your skin feeling moisturized.The 4 star rating is due to more of a preference, I don\u2019t like the remaining feeling of having moisturized my face. But for those with very dry skin or who do like that feeling this would probably be amazing!",
