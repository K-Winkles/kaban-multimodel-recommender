This foaming face wash purifies your pores for a deep clean and revitalized skin. With a rich lather and an advanced formula that helps protect the skin\u2019s natural ceramides, this luxurious sensitive skin face wash is ideal for skin that needs a boost. The pH balanced, fragrance free, and colorant free daily face wash offers clean face care. It is particularly important for dry, sensitive skin to be cleansed thoroughly and yet gently to preserve skin's ceramide levels and maintain healthy feeling skin. This dry skin face wash helps prepare the skin to have a clean base for moisturizers. The simple face wash was designed specifically for dry, sensitive skin. As an acne face wash, it is the second step in Curel's Japanese Skin Care version of the Japanese ritual ''double cleansing'', which is a two-step cleansing process that uses two different types of cleansers, one after the other. This exfoliating face wash works as natural face wash for women, daily face wash, and a fragrance free face wash. For best results, start your skincare routine with the Curel Japanese Skin Care Makeup Cleansing Gel, and follow with this Foaming Face Wash. Satisfaction guarantee. Limitations may apply.",

                "reviewText": "I have oily dehydrated skin so I really love essences in my skincare routine. Most of them are with hyaluronic acid (HA) and I was looking for one that is glycerin based.This essence is very hydrating, absorbs very quickly, doesn't leave sticky residue like the ones with HA. Has no scent. My skin gets sensitive in winter time and gets red easily. The product did not irritate my skin, no additional redness, it helped calm my skin.I will repurchase this product and am also interested in trying more products from this company.",

I recommend the sebum control from Curel which is also a foaming cleanser that works wonders for textured skin. This one is good, hydrating, and doesn't aggravate the skin/reduces redness and irritation. I recommend the product itself, however I was very upset with the quantity. I opened the bottle and the cleanser was only filled about halfway. Which ridiculous considering the amount you get and the cost you pay.",

Just for a reference, I used to use Bobbi Brown oil cleanser which was good but not perfect since I felt slight dryness on my skin.In my humble opinion, this is the best so far since it does remove everything even mascara (doesn\u2019t leave dark smudge under eyes), yet it doesn\u2019t dry out my skin at all. Also the price is very affordable considering it lasted 1.5 months for me even though I used generous amount each time.This isn\u2019t scented so I guess that\u2019s a plus for some people.",

On one occasion I'd washed my face then had to answer the phone before I'd had time to apply my serums and moisturiser, normally my face would feel horrendous if this ever happened but not with this cleanser, it's not drying at all - just perfect.I did also buy the Curel Makeup Cleansing Gel, (equally as good) which I use before to remove any make up. Both are beautiful products and such good value.",
