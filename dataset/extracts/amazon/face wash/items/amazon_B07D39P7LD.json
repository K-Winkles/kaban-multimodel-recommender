Normally, face products with minty, menthol type ingredients cling to my skin and cause irritation, no matter how hard I try to rinse it off. But this face wash is formulated nicely. It rinses off very well and leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed, healthy-looking and never dried out. It is a very thin liquid, so squeeze the tube slowly and carefully. I find that a little goes a long way. Yeah, this is a nice find. Glad I took a chance. And If exfoliation is part of your routine, this product, and a quality, natural loofah, work great together. Hydr\u00e9a London Organic Egyptian Loofah Spa Pad is the one I like.",

                "reviewText": "We have many allergies and sensitivities in our house, so scent during use and lingering after use are as important as comfortable shave. The scent in Pacific Shaving cream is citrusy in use but washes off completely. The cream is very lubricating and slippery even after going over an area twice or three times. The second choice Andalou is identical in comfort and closeness. The scent is subtle and also washes away completely. Neutrogena was my go to, is unavailable now, but I would have replaced with either of the first two as it isn\u2019t as close a shave and the scent lingers. I will NEVER buy Vanicream again. The shave is similar to the first two, but the scent makes me gag so much that I want to vomit. And I have changed many diapers and cleaned up lots of vomit without any issues!",

I have two other brands on my list to try, but I don't think I'm going to look any further",

                "reviewText": "I have serious problems with the long lingering fragrances in most shaving products, both for myself and the ones my husband uses. The menthol odor in this cream is \"wake up refreshing\" and does not linger afterwards like the smell of most products. It washes off, but leaves the skin very soft and smooth. And the price is reasonable!As an aside: We use Harry's razors and blades, but I suspect this cream would improve shaving experience with other high quality razors and blades also. I stopped using disposable blades after finding that every brand I tried nicked and cut my skin badly.I know that Andalou also makes some \"flavors\" of shave cream for women, but this one suits both of us very well.",
