I\u2019ve never experienced bad breakouts or acne however my complexion is sensitive and can get pretty red or itchy if I use something too harsh. My skin also dries out easily. This is perfect for someone who needs a nice, good clean while also needing to be gentle enough not to cause irritation.",

                "reviewText": "I like that this face wash smells good-very clean scent, no coconut smell (bummer), lathers up and your skin feels moisturized but clean. Can't beat the price! I have purchased some cleansers that cost way more and did less. I have sensitive skin and had no problems with this. Definitely recommend!",
