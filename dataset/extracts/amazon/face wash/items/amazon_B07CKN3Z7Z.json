It does not make me break out. It has no scent - which I love because I don't want to put perfumes on my face. My skin doesn't feel overly dry or oily, so I find it perfect. I also like that it is in a frosted gel form that I can just squeeze a small amount on my hand, add water and gently apply to my face and wash off easily with warm or cold water.",

I will admit these times I wasn\u2019t paying as close of attention to how I was opening it as I was half asleep going through my nightly routine but I shouldn\u2019t have to be worried about cutting myself on a face wash bottle!
