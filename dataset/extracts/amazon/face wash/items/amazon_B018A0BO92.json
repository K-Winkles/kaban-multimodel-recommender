                "reviewText": "One of the best face washes I\u2019ve ever used. I don\u2019t know how to describe it but I can feel that it works. My skin is soft immediately after use and I\u2019ve been using it daily for a little over a week and already seeing results. The pump is broken on mine so o have to open it fully and get it out straight from the bottle, but for how good the product is and the fact that those things are typically not a common occurrence I didn\u2019t even bother to complain. I love this face wash! 4 stars only because the pump is broken on mine. Still works great though!",
