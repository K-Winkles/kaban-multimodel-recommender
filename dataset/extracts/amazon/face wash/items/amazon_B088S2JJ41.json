                "reviewText": "Amazing product for oily and sensitive skin. It's the only cleanser that makes my face feel really clean.If you let this cleanser remain on your skin for more than a couple minutes it will dry out your skin quite a bit. If that happens (especially with combination skin), this can make my skin feel tight so I sometimes add a little moisturizer after using this.I've tried every facial cleanser made by Olay and cetaphil, cerave foaming, dove, etc. I would wash my face three times a day and it would still never feel clean. The only facial cleanser I ever liked this much was a custom product sold through an esthetician for eight times this price but can't get anymore and I hadn't been able to find anything like it. That was a green cleanser with a unique odor - I believe that's the same clay that's used in this new Neutrogena product. This Neutrogena cleanser is very similar to that; but a little more extreme and drying - which I don't mind terribly since I could follow up with a moisturizer or reduce the amount of time I let it sit on my skin.",

The formula here is good, but I won't buy it again because the dispenser clogs immediately (usually a coconut-derived ingredient that solidifies), so it is a hassle to unclog and try to use. I also dislike the added scent, which is an odd, old-smelling fragrance. The constantly-clogged dispenser means I'll probably end up throwing this away, which is a waste.",

                "reviewText": "This has been great for my oily skin without drying me out. I have battled acne for years and this is the only product I've found that keeps me clear using it morning and night. I've been using for over a year now and have been very happy with it. My forehead doesn't feel like a KFC floor anymore. The skin perfecting serum at night helps as well.",
