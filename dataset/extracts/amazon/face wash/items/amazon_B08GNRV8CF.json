                "reviewText": "I recently discovered the RoC Multi Correxion Revive + Glow Gel Facial Cleanser, and I'm excited to share my experience with this fantastic skincare product. It has quickly become my new favorite go-to face cleanser, and here's why.First and foremost, the ease on the skin is remarkable. The gentle, yet effective formula is a blessing for those with sensitive or easily irritated skin. It cleanses without causing dryness or redness, and I appreciate how it doesn't strip away the skin's natural moisture. It's a rare find when you're looking for a cleanser that's both thorough and gentle.The packaging also deserves a shout-out. The sleek, user-friendly bottle is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. The pump dispenser makes it effortless to get just the right amount of product, ensuring that nothing goes to waste.The inclusion of vitamin C in this cleanser is a game-changer. After using it, my skin feels incredibly refreshed, hydrated, and clean. Vitamin C is known for its brightening and skin-renewing properties, and this cleanser does an excellent job of revitalizing my complexion.The addition of glycolic acid is another bonus. It offers gentle exfoliation, helping to remove dead skin cells and revealing a smoother, more radiant skin surface. This is particularly beneficial for improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of fine lines and imperfections.Lastly, I appreciate that this RoC cleanser is paraben-free and sulfate-free. It's clear that they've taken a more natural and skin-friendly approach, which aligns with my values in skincare.",

                "reviewText": "I realize my view might be warranted for \"grown\" ladies like myself. And I'm saying right now, this brand and product is everything.First, I\u2019ve had the most sensitive skin since I can remember. In my teens did the clear and clear fad...broke out. Tried Neutrogena... not for me. Gave in to Noxzema with a Loreal sensitive daily moisturizer through high school and college...got me by. By the time I reached my late 30s the struggle became real. I tried everything: Olay, Garnier, la mercier, and other over priced fancy brands I can no longer recall the name of. Bottom line, - they all weren't working. It wasn't just random breakouts; it was redness, dryness, dark circles, and tired skin.A lovely coworker recommended Roc (after I complemented her skin) and I haven't looked back. I've exercised and danced forever, and today at 42, still lift and run 4 times a week, drink greens daily, mind my nutrition, and have two teenagers...if I cheat on ROC for more than a month (because, yes, the Ipsy addiction is real), I see a difference. The glow, firmness, and circles are different. I'm not saying do not take care of yourself and ROC will fix it. I'm saying it's a great addition to your skincare routine if you're \"growing gracefully\" and doing all the right things. For those who have issues with it drying, you either need more water (or it's not for you yet). But from the girl (that I know) with the most sensitive skin to date, ROC was life changing when my skin matured. Hope this helps.",

But after a while, I felt like my skin looked tan (and I wasn't going in the sun). One day I was pumping it onto my white buff-puff pad and realized the cleanser was orange, AND my sponge was stained with a carroty/brownish color. Then I realized my skin was also becoming stained. It's great if you want a sunglow. For me, it wasn't a good color. And my face was starting to look darker than my neck! After a week of not using it, my skin is gradually fading. I wish they had made this a clear cleanser. I hate to stop using it, but I\u2019m not sure if I want that look\u2026",
