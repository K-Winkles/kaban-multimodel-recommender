So far this item works very well at cleansing the skin. No irritation, no fragrance, and no residue left behind. I use this with my electronic silicone face washer and it works fine, but it\u2019s nothing special. It pairs well with the other Hada Labo products, but if you already love your cleanser stick with that one. I have mature skin that behaves oily in the summertime, but I will probably use a non-sudsing cleanser in the winter. The sudsing action for this cleanser is fairly mild. Still it may be drying for some skin types.",

I really liked that it cleaned my face really well while leaving my skin feeling hydrated. But after they changed their packaging their product feels completely different! Every time I wash my face using this product, it felt like my face was stripped of all oils and the texture in my face just feels rough to the touch. I was unsure of this change but I kept on using it for about a month and then dry patches started appearing on my face. I had to stop using half of my other skincare products (that I\u2019ve been using for years already) cause it seems like my skin became really sensitive and started reacting to skincare products. Anyway, I need to find a different face cleanser now.",

Furthermore, it came with a tape (?) that was supposed to make sure it didn't open during transit, but the tape looked tampered with.Then I got a replacement, and the packaging was of a new design and looked more legit. The bottle felt more \"full\" and i used it. I hope this is real. I don't know if I will buy anymore of Hada Labo through Amazon. I feel like I'm just taking a risk now. To be honest, I might just return this for the sake of not getting anxiety over using this everytime. LOL",
