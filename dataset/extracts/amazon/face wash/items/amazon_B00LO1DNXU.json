                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars New go-to face wash",
                "reviewText": "So, I used the grapefruit Neutrogena gel face wash for YEARS - at least a decade - and after spending the last year or so researching about skincare I realized that what I was using probably wasn't that great for my adult acne. Worked great all those years ago on my teenage acne because it just dried everything out so much.... but now I need something different. I knew I wanted something that had that salicylic acid in it but was more efficient at washing my face without just drying it out. In comparison to the Neutrogena wash my face does not feel stripped after using this and yet I notice that the medication is still working. I know this because my acne was not as severe after using this for about a month and I was getting less dead skin buildup around my nose. I want to also point out that switching to this did NOT completely solve my acne problem, but it solved the issue I had specifically with what face wash I was using. I still broke out when I switched to this but the amount of cysts I was getting over time DID decrease and any I already had were quick to calm down and not be so angry and red.*****Below is me going more in-depth with my skincare and what helped me clear my acne*****What really drove it home and got my skin to be mostly clear with no cysts with only the occasional pimple/white head was that I also added in a toner about a month after using this wash and I also got a lower % benzoyl peroxide!! I got the Ordinary glycolic 7% for night time, the cosRX AHA/BHA toner for morning and I use 5% benzoyl peroxide morning and night on my problem areas. I use moisturizer (Simple water gel cream) on my t-zone, eyes, cheeks and neck. No SPF because I don't go outside at the moment lol.... prayforme but anyway...My old routine consisted of just the Neutrogena grapefruit face wash and 10% BP on problem areas AM and PM, but switching and adding in the products I did has helped my skin tremendously: less irritation, dryness, redness but still getting that exfoliation and oil control. Figuring out what will work for you may take trial and error but I would recommend this face wash to anyone looking for a quality face wash that will not only cleanse their skin without stripping it but to also have those acids to help with your breakouts and dead skin buildup. My skin was used to that exposure to salicylic acid for all those years so I felt no burning or tightness when using this. It was so gentle and refreshing :) There is a menthol smell and feel to this but it feels good on the skin.And just to throw this in there since it is relative to my experience and may hold true to yours as well, diet can make a difference in your skin! From my understanding, it depends on the person as to how much it affects your skin and which foods may trigger outbreaks (some people need to cut out milk, others don't) but once you pinpoint your individual food sensitivities and cut those out your skin WILL be healthier. For me, that is dairy, anything high glycemic (sugar, honey, maple syrup, certain fruits, breads), or made with wheat flour, and alcohol. I used to make homemade bread with whole wheat flour and honey thinking I was being all healthy but I was breaking out BAD, even after only eating a slice, because I was eating foods my body didn't like. I can't even have a taste of cheese, literally one smidgen on a cracker, without getting a HUGE cyst or two within a few days. Not even a singular glass of wine without my face giving me the middle finger. My point is don't expect a face wash to fix your diet or to make up for any other unhealthy behaviors contributiing negatively towards the health of your skin. I learned that the hard way. Good luck to anyone reading this that is trying to clear up their skin or just to have healthier skin :)",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this cleanser since January 2023 and it is good but not perfect... I want to stress out first that when I began using this product it was in conjunction with prescribed face topicals for my acne. It has now been about 2 weeks I stop using my prescribed face topicals and I am only using this cleanser with a moisturizer. I have not break out badly like I used to but I do not know if this cleanser is helping me with that or my skin is still under the effects of the prescribed medication.At first, I noticed this cleanser was very gentle on my skin but recently for about 2-3 weeks I have been noticing some dryness sensation on certain sections of the face after I wash it with this cleanser. Sections like the cheeks, my chin, and the area surrounding the mouth. I know the area around the lips and mouth can be very sensitive and that is why I try to avoid it as much with this cleanser; but I still feel that drying sensation. The drying sensation that I am feeling is tolerable, but I just wish it was not there. There is no peeling or anything like that. This cleanser also makes the skin on my face feel tight in a decent way and although there is a very light to almost no medicated scent, there is still a scent.A medium little goes a long way and it lathers well on the face with water. I feel it does give my face some moisture, but lately it has been drying my face a little too. After washing my face and neck and drying them, specially my face feels very soft. It does control the oily complexion on my face a little better than other cleansers, but does not WOW me either. I use this cleanser in conjunction with La Roche-posay Toleriane double repair matte moisturizer and they go hand in hand well.Overall, I believe this a good product and I am glad I tried it but need to keep trying for longer time and see where that takes me. This is a decent brand worth exploring; especially if you suffer from acne and oily skin. I will for sure be exploring more of this brands' products in the future.",
