                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic product. It has put my blepharitis in remission and cured warts! I was upset as I enjoy wearing makeup and was not able to wear it because of Demodex Blepharitis causing such terrible eye irritation and was making it hard to see. Also, I had been gardening, and as often happens, walking around in the dirt in sandals led to some ankle warts. I bought the soap to cure the Demodex, as I had read that this is a promising cure, but started using it as my bath soap too and I cured my warts!First I should explain that if you've used Dr. Bonner's soap, this will not seem unusual to you. It is not thick or gel-like. But if using it on the face, put a teaspoon's worth in your cupped hand and add a little water, then rub hands together and wash your face, scrubbing and splashing. If you have Blepharitis, keep your eyes tightly shut and use your fingers to thoroughly wash your eyelash area, being careful not to accidentally get in your eyes (stings!). Then cup your hands and rinse (I cup my hands, fill with water and rinse about 6-10 times, being careful to ensure all the soap is rinsed away from my eyes). It will rinse off much more quickly than regular soap, but rinse thoroughly.I have super dry skin. Afterward, I put a small dime sized amount of Desert Essence Cucumber and Aloe (with Tea Tree lotion) on and then in my palm I place 3 drops of Vitamin E oil and 4 Drops of Tea Tree oil. I rub these together and then gently rub all over my face, keeping my eyes tightly shut and applying right up to the lash line but not over.At first I did not care for the aroma of Tea Tree Oil, but now I've come to enjoy t knowing it keeps my eyes clean and healthy. Best of all I am able to wear makeup! :) I wash my makeup brushes in this soap too to avoid repropogating those little Demodex monsters.I paid for this product myself, and I did not receive any $ for writing this review. I just wanted other sufferers to get some relief!",

                "reviewText": "So firstly, if you suffer from bacne, or ingrown hairs this stuff is wonderful!It's a bit harsh and drying/stripping for facial use.Also, those who suffer with fungal acne, this stuff definitely works to get rid of it. I dealt with a bad fungal acne bout on my back from wearing sports bras while working out.Nothing worked! Tried cream from the dr, tried sulfar soaps and other FA treatments. Which may have made it lessen a bit but wouldn't get rid of it... or it would go away only to resurface bad in like 2-3 days. Legit I was losing my mind bc it it drove me crazy!This not only got rid of it, got rid of my bacne, but has kept it from coming back! I suspect it's the tea tree which you smell straight away as soon as you open the bottles.It also works great as sort of like an \"after shave wash.\" I've dealt with bad ingrown hairs my whole life. This stuff will sting quite a bit using it on freshly shaved skin but it keeps me from getting the ingrowns.",

                "reviewText": "First off, GREAT SUGGESTION on the \"Put it in a foaming pump bottle\" comments. Its perfecttttt. Seriously go get one at your local store or buy foaming soap off Jet (WHY ARE EMPTY CONTAINERS SO EXPENSIVE ONLINE?????)This soap is awesome. It cleans very well, smells good to me, comes in a large quantity, priced well at time of purchase (for reference I got 2x for $20), my skin feels smooth and clean after and it doesn't have anything in it that is harmful or unpleasant for my skin. It has also been helping my skin a lot. I would say I had worse acne than most people do. And I feel I'm getting close and closer to zero with this and another product.Bonus : When I purchased this, I also purchased Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~ 12 oz Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~ 12 oz AND YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BUY THIS TOO. This toner is SO AMAZING. I use this constantly. It makes my skin look incredible and has SIGNIFICANTLY reduced my acne, helped keep my pores clean and small, and is the perfect finisher for this. Seriously the best $10 I've ever spent along with this.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 31, and have suffered from acne since I was 11. I'm trying to use more natural products, and tea tree oil is supposed to help prevent acne due to it's antibacterial properties. So I started using this almost every night for the past few years and I've really noticed a difference in my skin! It's clearer, and the acne that does appear heals faster when I wash with this cleanser. I also like that it takes off pretty much all my makeup and really cleans my skin of all dirt and oil. The only downside is it is drying (in the wintertime I'll alternate using this and a moisturizing cleanser every other night) so be sure to use a good nighttime moisturizer in combination with this facewash. Otherwise, I'll continue to use it for as long as I have problematic skin (which I've contended will probably be quite a while).",

I fill a foaming pump dispenser which I have in my shower. It's easier to use as a foam than liquid.It's not necessarily a pretty fragrant smelling product, but doesn't smell bad either., just natural. It cleans well without drying out your face or making your face feel greasy, but more importantly are the natural non toxic ingredients; and 1lt will last you anywhere from 8months and more.I introduced it to my family and friends, who now also use this",
