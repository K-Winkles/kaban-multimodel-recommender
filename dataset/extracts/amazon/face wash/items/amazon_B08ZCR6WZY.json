                "reviewText": "I love this stuff. I used to be a staunch supporter of La Roche Posay Pigmentclar. I unfortunately left that $29 face wash in a hotel shower on vacation. Upon return I ended up looking for an affordable replacement as my wallet recovered from a Disney World summer vacation. I also wanted a wash with less fragrance in it. At first, I tried the Cocokind acid cleanser and absolutely hated it \u2014 it smelled awfully chemical, did not suds up even a little and did not leave my skin feeling clean. Sure my skin was somewhat hydrated because the soap was gentle, but I don\u2019t feel the acids really worked as well as those in Pigmentclar to clear my skin and lighten dark spots.Enter this Hero cleanser. The bottle drew me in, I\u2019ll admit. It\u2019s not great for travel because there\u2019s no way to lock the pump mechanism, so you\u2019d have to port this to a different container.The texture is super jelly like and has very small pulp like particles mixed in. If anyone has ever used a peeling gel it kind of feels like those after you start rubbing them in. I think the particles in this cleanser act as a very gentle surface exfoliator. It has a very neutral smell, but not nasty or chemical.After wash, it leaves me clean but not stripped to the point of my skin being squeaky. It suds up satisfyingly but doesn\u2019t overly dry me out. I use a pump and a half to wash. I have dry skin due to my PCOS medication. That being said I use acid face washes to keep my PCOS acne gently in check. I love this face wash for this purpose. It leaves my skin soft and I have absolutely seen an increase in the evenness of the texture and tone of my skin over the past two months of use; the acids are effective.Overall - I thoroughly enjoy this Hero wash more than the Pigmentclar. The price is right and the effect is better for my skin type (27, dry acne prone). I\u2019d love to see a different pump that would be good for travel. I love the bottle because you can see the cool texture of the wash. Maybe there could be a mini version for travel.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is I\u2019m not a big fan of the scent and the texture is kinda weird, I was expecting more of a smooth gel and instead it\u2019s thicker and kind of grainy, it\u2019s hard to explain. I usually do 2 pumps in my hand, mix it up with water and then foam it up in my hands before applying it to my face and then it works great.",

The texture is more to the gel side of an exfoliator so if you have sensitive skin, this is perfect for you. I like that it is gentle enough to use daily. It really is a great product however if you are looking for strong exfoliation, this is not for your face -but great for your hands!",
