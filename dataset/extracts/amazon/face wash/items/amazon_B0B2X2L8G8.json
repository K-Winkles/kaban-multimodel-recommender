The added vitamin C seemed to enhance its effectiveness, leaving my skin feeling refreshed after each use. This is to be noted that it only happens over time, though.However, one drawback I found was their quick depletion. These bars seemed to run out faster than I anticipated, especially considering their price. While the results were impressive, the shorter lifespan of the product made it less economical compared to similar options I've used previously.Despite this, if you're looking for a quick and effective solution to tackle dark spots and uneven skin tone, these soap bars could be a solid choice. Just keep in mind that their shorter lifespan might affect the overall value for prolonged use.",

Then I started using it as a face wash, even skin tone on my face as well!!! I have noticed it has minimized the size of the pores on my face and I have not had a breakout since using this product. I was staring at this bar last night thinking \u201cwhat the heck is in this!!!??\u201d It definitely leaves your skin feeling tight so I follow up with a moisturizer. This is key I think.",

                "reviewText": "I love how this soap smells and the consistency of it. It feels so rich and just makes me feel CLEAN after washing my face with it. Its a bit drying but its an amazing little bar of soap. The only downside that I see to this soap is that I feel like its not really removing any marks on my skin. Other than that, its great.",

I can honestly say the brown spots on my face have reduced considerably no laser treatment will be necessary which is what I was going to do. It works little by little, you'll need patience, it doesn't work over night. Give it time and you will see the spots fade away. I truly think that in time they will dissapear completely.",

                "reviewText": "I have very very sensitive skin and surprisingly it doesn\u2019t sting or burn like some soaps do on my face. It also has almost completely made dark spots/freckles I had from the sun on my face disappear! 3 that are a little darker are still there but I\u2019m thinking with more time using it they will all hopefully disappear. It also has lightened my arm pits pretty dramatically. After 7 pregnancies my skin darkened in the creases on my neck got darker. Now they have almost completely disappeared. I looked at my neck in the mirror one day and it took me by surprise how much longer it looked. I also did like another review said and cut it in smaller pieces so I don\u2019t have the entire bar sitting in the shower. Think that helps it last longer.",

My face is bright and dark spots from sun damage are almost gone! I no longer wear foundation or even a powder! My skin has never looked better and I am 59! My chest had some sun damage and it is disappearing before my eyes. I have been using it for months and every time I shower/wash my face it seems even better than before. I am a loyal customer for LIFE! I'm even starting a subscription, which I have never done before for anything. I wish I had taken before pics but had no idea that a little bar of soap could make such a difference. 100% recommend, but only to people I really love. LoL",
