                "reviewText": "I was kind of diagnosed with rosacea --although, I feel it was an allergic reaction I had to dried cranberries and poor diet. Anyhow, my face has cleared up (gut cleanse, good diet and work out/trail run), but my skin is still pretty sensitive --always has been. I can't do scented anything on my skin. Also, with being cautious of ingredients in hair and skin products, I always go with vegan and plant based -it is not an option, especially after my mom had breast cancer.With all that said, I love DERMA-E, I am a huge fan of all of their products. I have a college daughter and have taught her since high school to take care of her skin and buy all vegan/plant based products for her as well. Teach them young! Her hair and skin is always healthy and beautiful, no break outs or anything.I bought this moisturizer, I was using the generic blue label DERMA-E for sometime, and I loved the Vitamin C addition. I kid you not, my daughter and I both applied some the day it was delivered and the next day my daughter tells me she loves it and wants her own bottle of it. I agreed with her that it was SO good. Both of our faces looked brighter and refreshed. After a week and two weeks of using it, we noticed further difference in our face --brighter, refreshing, and skin smoothed out for me in some slight textured/wrinkle areas (I'm 41 and age is hitting me and my skin).",

I used to deal with near constant small break outs especially around my chin and mouth area. Even without using the cleansing gel, as long as I keep using the moisturiser, my skin continues being relatively well behaved! I ran out early on and tried a different brand and started breaking out straight away. Shipping is always fast as well which is a super bonus! Ordered to Brisbane on a Monday, shipped on Tuesday and got to me on Wednesday (shipped from kangaroo point) and they even included a little freeby which was a very pleasant surprise!",

I have tried so many cleansers in my life, and thought that it might not hurt anyone if I had to try yet another cleanser. I must admit it works very well for my oily skin. I came across this range of products when I was visiting relatives in the USA. My sister was using the products and she raved about how good the oily skin range was. Forgot all about it, until recently when I decide to try it and searched on Amazon and found a company in NY which stocked them. I have been using this for weeks now and I can for sure say that my skin tone is becoming even and brighter. It is not drying to the skin and smells fruity too. I would recommend this products to anyone with oily type of skin.",
