Manal, saw a villager pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina. Fascinated by the plant's effect on the elephant, he returned home to India to seek scientific evidence for why this particular plant would have such a beneficial, calming effect. Young Manal's mother gave him her bangles to sell so he could pursue his work, and Himalaya was born. Once he fully understood the science behind this special botanical, Mr. Manal bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and began his work. At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a few hundred tablets, one small tablet at a time. But his hard work paid off. This remarkable plant would later become Serpina, the anti-hypertensive drug in 1934. Himalaya\u2019s legacy has always been one of researching nature and using the tools of modern science to develop and produce Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade herbal medicine products. And today, that legacy continues. Mr. Manal had a vision of helping people be well. Today, Himalaya Herbal Healthcare has turned a time-honored herbal tradition into a complete range of contemporary, proprietary formulas and single herbs dedicated to making the world well one person at a time. Since 1930, Himalaya has been passionate about the healing wisdom of herbs. We offer a wide range of herbal supplements, toothpaste and personal care products that unlock the powerful healing benefits of herbs.",

It's like a whole new face.My face had all three \"climates\" . Sometimes normal, sometimes dry, sometimes oily. Not only did this face wash work well whichever day my moody skin acted up, but it was gentle the entire time.You don't need to use much, as a little goes a long way. You will have to rinse your face thoroughly afterward or it will remain.I will definitely be purchasing this again.",

The kind that is shaped like a sea shell. Sorry thats so specific. It smells alright and ive been using it for about two weeks now. My face feels soft, but not more soft than other products i've tried prior. The biggest upset for me is the facewash is literally a liquid soap matter that dumps out of the bottle. My first use equaled the amount of at least 5 uses due to it spilling all over the tub. Make sure you hold it up right until you're ready to open and pour it out, unless you want it all over your shower and/or body. A couple examples of liquid like substances found \"in home\" for comparison: clear shampoo, laundry detergent. My dish soap(Dawn). Although all of these I feel may be slightly more thick than this face wash. Some may prefer that, however I do not. I would not recommend this to someone unless I knew standard liquid face wash is what they are looking for.",

This product is not it! I\u2019m still here trying to figure out how to get my skin to bounce back.",

In the few times I tried this, it lathered nicely and didn\u2019t dry out my skin but I won\u2019t continue with it. If you don\u2019t mind floral scented cleansers, you will likely enjoy this cleanser but if you prefer mild or non-scented, avoid this one.",
