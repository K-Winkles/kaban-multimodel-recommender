The only downside (for me) is that the smell is very strong. There\u2019s sunflower oil in it and that\u2019s what i smell. To me it smells exactly like that sunflowers perfume that was so popular in the mid 90s. If you like the smell of sunflowers, it\u2019s no problem. I personally don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t give me a migraine, but I deliberately don\u2019t breathe through my nose the entire time I\u2019m using it, because I can \u201cfeel\u201d the scent in my head. Fellow Migrainers, you know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s a testament to the texture of the cream and the way it makes my skin feel after that I\u2019m using it in spite of the scent. I\u2019m going to check Burt\u2019s Bees to see if they have something similar but without the sunflower oil.",

It's almost like someone wearing too much perfume. I don't think I'm particularly sensitive to smells but I find this one pretty intense.",
