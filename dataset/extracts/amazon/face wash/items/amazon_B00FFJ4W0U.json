Personally, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d say it\u2019s moisturizing. My face feels tighter and drier, but not necessarily dried out.The only issue is\u2026 the bottle cap. The opening is so smallll, and has a white bump inside that makes it even smaller. Most of the time I don\u2019t get any of the little beads, but one comes through and gets stuck/blocks the space. Sometimes, I honestly have to squeeze the bottle as hard as I occasionally realize I grip the steering wheel when driving in heavy rain.Overall\u2026 I really like it. Would suggest it. Definitely helps me feel more awake in the morning. I will buy again. But, it\u2019d be VERY nice to see a new cap design.",

So fast so no more excuses for going to bed with makeup on! I do need eye makeup remover for the mascara though. What a great, thrifty find! I wish it came in a travel size.",
