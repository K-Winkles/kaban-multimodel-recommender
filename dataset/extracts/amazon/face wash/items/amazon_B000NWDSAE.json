I have definitely tried much of the competition over the years and i always go back to the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Scrub for my daily face scrub. Like most people, its all about how the skin feels after you are finished, but I also like a scrub that both allows a lather to build and the slight grit does well for me.
