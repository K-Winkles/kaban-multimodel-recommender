I've tried other Acure skin care products (Brightening, Ultra Hydrating lines) & this by far is my favorite cleanser in quite some time. It's not drying & I think it's helped smooth the appearance of my facial skin. I hate overly perfumed products, this is lightly scented enough for me, it makes a nice foamy lather & it rinses off easily. I haven't had any irritation with it either. This is a staple for me, I think I'm on me second tube & will definitely buy this again. And I appreciate how accessible this is given that I can easily get it at either Whole Foods or Amazon. The one downside is the plastic tube, I don't think it's compostable.",

I\u2019m ok w some wrinkles as long as I\u2019m \u201cdewey\u201d and healthy!",
