                "reviewText": "I am in love with Acure! I have struggled to find natural hair and skin care products that work for me, and Acure has been a winner in all categories. I will note, however, that knowing your hair and skin types and choosing products based off them seems to be more important with natural products. I never paid attention to things like that before and never had any issues, but have run into a few Acure products that didn't quite cut it at first and I realized it was because it didn't match up well with my hair/skin type.Anyway, now to this moisturizer. I have an awful mix of combo, sensitive, and acne prone skin. Then to make things more interesting, I am also allergic to all the active ingredients found in acne treatments and some unknown ingredient that is usually in parfum (a compound of chemicals that companies don't have to tell you the individual ingredients of because it is usually a patented formula...yay me!). So was told to only buy products marketed for sensitive skin with no fragrance. Unfortunately, everything I tried over the years either made my face so oily and gross or made me break out horribly...like the huge, super painful zits. So for years my skincare routine consisted of washing my face with the gold dial soap bar and occasionally using a scrub when the dry skin across my cheekbones got to bugging me.A few weeks ago I started using Acure's face wash and decided to give this moisturizer a try. I was immediately impressed by how well it soaked into my skin. Within days my skin is so soft and I've had no breakouts. For someone who has never been able to use a moisturizer, this is a miracle product for me. And I small bit really does go a long way. Even using 1-2 times a day, I see this stuff lasting a while.I started out with Acure's facial cleansing cream a few weeks ago, but something just seemed kinda....off. So I ordered the gel instead and the difference it made in just one wash! Wow...my skin felt amazing after getting out of the shower! I'm sure the cream works for some people, but it was too thick for my combo skin. The gel is much lighter and not as moisturizing. I start with Acure's pore clarifying facial scrub, then this wash, and follow up with their oil matifying facial moisturizer. I also use the pore clarifying face mask once a week. My skin has never felt or looked so good. I am finally seeing am improvement in the blackheads that have been lingering since puberty and my skin seems more even, bright, less irritated looking, and so soft. Acure has been my miracle for both my hair and skin!",

                "reviewText": "When it comes to cosmetics, (and life), there's two things to always remember:1.) Everything is relative.2.) Everything in moderation.It's important to be critical of every product you find and plan to try; check the ingredients, take your time, and don't get desperate. What results may work for some will not necessarily work for you. Give your skin the time and space it needs to breathe, and don't go crazy with the number of products you use, or more importantly, the frequency. I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin, and after using this product every other day, once a day for a week, I noticed pretty intense drying followed by a rash. After discontinuing use I began to notice an immediate improvement, so I'm convinced this wasn't working for me.Still a very solid product and I could see it working well for heartier skin types. It's simple, and the fragrance is nice, not overpowering. It dispenses in a gel form and lathers very smoothly. Not a bad price either.Overall I give this product 3 stars; it did not work for what I needed and did not fit my skin type, but it is obviously still a quality product.",
