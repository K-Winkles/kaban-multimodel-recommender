If she had told me right away that she stopped using it, I could have returned it. Wondering if I still can. UPDATE: AMAZON AND THE SUPPLIER CAME THROUGH WITH ALLOWING MY RETURN DUE TO OUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER PARTICULAR SKIN. THE PRODUCT CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM A FACIALIST SO I KNOW OTHERS USE IT SUCCESSFULLY.",
