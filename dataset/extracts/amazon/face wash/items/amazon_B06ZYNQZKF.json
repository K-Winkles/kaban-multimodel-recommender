I have tried MANY products with minimal to no results. After my first wash with this product, I noticed how much it reduced the blackheads and a significant reduction in pours. After the first wash!!!! I am also using the toner and moisturizer. I have now been using these 3 products for about a month now and my skin has been transformed! No drying out, no over production of oil from my skin! This system may be pricey but I assure you it is so WORTH it. The results are amazing. This product does what it says it will do!

A lot of times it would clog my large pores, or I would have white heads along with dry/ red blotchy skin. Then I researched some of Paula\u2019s Choice products. I picked out what I thought fit my type of skin. After some adjusting my skin has been the best it has ever been. I don\u2019t have big blackheads, white heads, dry skin, or red blotches. And it feels great. In the morning I use the face wash, eye cream, and the daily hydrating fluid lotion. At night I use the face wash, the toner (make sure you let your face completely dry afterwards before moving on), I use 3 drops of the boost (let that dry), then I put on the night oil free moisturizer.Every Tuesday night I use the exfoliate instead of the toner. You let it dry completely. It takes about 15 minutes. I usually don\u2019t put anything on after using the exfoliate because I am too tired to wait for it to dry. It works for me.Then about once a month or every two weeks on a Friday night, after using the toner, I use exfoliate rinse off treatment. Afterwards I finish with the boost and night moisturizer.",

So I dont use often, and I moisturize well after using it.I use tiny gentle exfoliating pads made of rubber that gently massages my face. So I apply a drop of this stuff on the two little pads I have add water snd rub them together to suds it.Then I exfoliate.",

We started to use this instead of the pricey stuff we bought from her office and it has worked wonders! Skin clear within the month. We will keep this in our rotation for sure!",

                "reviewText": "They saved my skin when all other products have failed. My face has cleared up FAST due to this product, but another product of theirs saved my leg and my sanity.(and it is a facial product!!!)I have had a problem with my left leg for 4 years. Doctors could not help me, nothing over the counter could help me, I was at the end of my rope. I am a middle-to-well trained aromatherapist and I can help everyone else, but I could not help myself!!! My leg was covered in red nasty welts, Pimple/cyst type things, ingrown hairs, was EXTREMELY itchy(which made it worse) and would grow skin over the problem areas, only for me to discover that they were infected underneath. It was, in essence, a living nightmare. One day on Facebook I saw an add for a deluxe sample of Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid w/Salicylic Acid. I decided to try it.(on my face, at first) Then one day I decided, why not try some on my leg? Within a week it started to itch less and look better. Within a month it started to regain an even color and now, after 3 months(I bought the big bottle) It is clear with only a few dark patches. I use it on my LEGS(both!! To prevent any reoccurences) Every night, along with my face. It succeeded when doctors, including dermatologists, could not. And I cannot count the number of them I went to. If you are not sure about trying this company or it's products.....do not hesitate. And BTW, I paid for this and am in no way affiliated or involved ] with them in any way. I am just a woman who was profoundly affected by their products and want to pass on what I have experienced. And in this, I DO Speak MY Truth. Dawn",
