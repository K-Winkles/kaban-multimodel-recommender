It does such a great job of cleansing areas like around the eye and doesn\u2019t have a negative effect on my sensitive skin.- it melt waterproof makeup so quickly! Other products you have to use so much to get the smallest result.- a little goes a long way. I use about 1-2 pumps every morning and night and it\u2019s more than enough- does a great job at cleansing the pores. I have noticed a huge difference in my pores.",

After using it for a month, my nose feels and looks cleaner than ever. I double-cleanse and use this every night. Not only does it help remove dirt and excess oils from my face but it also acts as a makeup cleanser as well. To double-cleanse I use a water-based cleanser after and my skin feels so fresh. I 100% recommend especially if you want to begin double-cleansing!!",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research into this before buying. I have sensitive acne prone combo skin and it has been fine for my skin thus far. The scent is very faint which I like. It's watery compared to a cleansing balm or castor oil that I was using beforehand. Price wise it's good, I thought it would have been thicker but its a bigger bottle at a good price for what it is. I haven't seen any dramatic differences with using it but I see no irritation nor breakouts from it which is a win in my book! If you're looking to get for the first step of double cleansing I reccomend it, as I find it almost doesn't feel fully gone after washing alone. I feel better going in with another cleanser to follow after however, it took off my makeup very well. I put it to the test and used elf cleansing balm on one side and the oil on the other of my face and it seemed to work just as good without irritating my eyes as well!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love the Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil! As someone who struggles with blackheads and daily makeup use, this product has been a game changer for my skin. First of all, the packaging is beautiful and the pump dispenser makes it easy to use and mess-free. The oil itself has a light and refreshing scent, and a little goes a long way. I was amazed at how easily this cleansing oil removed all of my makeup, including stubborn waterproof mascara. It left my skin feeling incredibly clean and nourished, without any greasy residue. But what truly sets this product apart is its ability to control pores and blackheads. After using it for just a few days, I noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my pores and a reduction in blackheads. My skin feels smoother and looks clearer than ever before. I also appreciate that this cleanser is made with natural ingredients, including heartleaf extract which has anti-inflammatory properties. It's gentle on my skin and doesn't cause any irritation or redness.Overall, I highly recommend the Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil to anyone looking for a high-quality Korean facial cleanser. It truly delivers on its promises.",

                "reviewText": "After one use of this, I can say it worked! I\u2019ve been using it for about three days, morning and nights, and I really do like this cleanser. Within one use, I could FEEL the sebum and dirt coming off! It felt like there was exfoliating beads in it.. but it was just all the dirt! I saw it ALL over my instagram reels, and I have very bad issues with blackhead/sebum in my t-zone area. I will update with images later on once I\u2019ve used it more.With a combo of retinol at night and vitamin c in the day time, this leaves my skin smooth and glossy!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because of the pictures!! I want my little sebaceus filaments gone too! Texture of this product is very milky/greasy/runny. Be careful with the pump because it will feel hard to push down but then BAM a big squirt of this all over the sink/counter. Anyway, it gets the job done. Does not burn my skin. I used the same brand facial cleanser after, and I feel very clean. The scent isn't wonderful but not my favorite either. Hard to describe. I will say it does not linger though. 4 stars. Fair price and definitely removes all makeup. Packaging could use some work.",

This product, doing a double cleanse with my regular face wash that ive been using (tatcha), followed by serums/moisturizer as usual.....let me tell you it TRANSFORMED my skin. Ive only been using it for a week now, and my skin is so soft, blackheads GONE, pores soooo much smaller, really giving that 'glass skin' look that we strive for. i did see SOME reviews saying it worked great at first for ppl then their skin went to shambles, so i really hope that aint the case here bc im in love with the current results.
