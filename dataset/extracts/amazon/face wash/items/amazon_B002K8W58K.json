                "reviewText": "I'm going to get emotional while writing this review because that's how amazing this product is. I'm 22 and have struggled with acne since before I even hit puberty at age 9 or 10 (why? No dermatologist could ever say, or ever recommend anything that worked). I have tried EVERYTHING. When I say everything, I mean it. Ev.ry.thing. My struggle with acne has made me shy, self conscious, depressed, angry, and desperate. I'm lucky enough that my acne is not as severe as it was when I was younger, but it is still moderate at all times. Not anymore. I tried every over the counter face wash, everything the dermatologist recommended, going on myocycline, sprionolactone, and even spending six months on a high dose of accutane (which, if you haven't heard of it, causes crazy birth defects if you get pregnant while using it and can cause depression, and in my case made mine worse, and can also mess with your cholesterol pretty badly). I went on accutane when I was 16 (six years ago) and for a few months after the course, my skin was alright. Not perfect, but better. Then it went crazy again. After spending six months on a terrible drug that dries out your body so badly that you can't get anything waxed because it will rip your skin off and having joint problems because of it, my acne. Came. Back. I wasn't about to go back on it, so I floated around from product to product for the next few years.Are you bored with my \"tragic\" story? Good. Because here's the happy ending. The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash. I got this four days ago and can already see results. I was using tea tree oil as a spot treatment with okay results, so I decided to try this wash. I was just about desperate enough to go back on accutane (it's really hard looking for jobs and being confident on interviews right out of college when your skin is blotchy and blemished) but I decided to try one more time. I woke up yesterday morning and was in such a fantastic mood because my skin looked BEAUTIFUL (or at least relatively so). I had NO new pimples. I cannot remember the last time I woke up with no new blemishes to ruin my day. I was on cloud 9. I even have a cyst on my chin that it's reducing very quickly, and I normally have to get shots of cortizone to make them go away. I'm not super prone to cystic acne, but occasionally I get it and it's painful and ugly. No OTC products can do anything about them, but this is somehow doing the trick.I know I've only been using this for a few days so if my results change I'll update the review, but words cannot express how happy I have been since I started using this. It sounds silly, but I really am. I kind of want to kiss whoever invented this.If you're on the fence about this product, BUY IT. It's incredible. It smells wonderful (though if you've smelled tea tree oil before and don't like the smell, you won't like this) which makes using it so much better. I've had other natural facial remedies that were semi-effective but I just couldn't bring myself to use them because I hate putting stuff on my face that I don't like the smell of.I use this at night by wetting my face a bit, then rubbing it in circles all over and rinsing it off with a thin washcloth. After that I use Alba Botanica's daily moisturizing cream.Body Shop, if you need a testimonial, contact me. Your product is amazing and I have nothing but positive things to say. I'm going to slowly acquire the entire tea tree line. Thank you for making a whole set of products with such a natural, wonderful oil!Update (original review on 1/6/15, update today 3/1/15)This product is still giving amazing results. My scars are fading, I have had fewer breakouts than ever, and am so happy with my results. I have since added some more Body Shop products to my regimen. I start with plain coconut oil as makeup remover. Then, I use this cleanser to wash my face. I follow it up with The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner, 8.4-Fluid Ounce , then use The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion, 1.69 Fluid Ounces as well as a tiny bit of The Body Shop Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion, 1.0 Fluid Ounces , and finish with a homemade mixture of coconut oil and NOW Foods Lavender & Tea Tree Oil, 1 ounce . I put the coconut, lavender, and tea tree oil mixture on any breakouts or inflamed areas, but not all over my face. It's kind of an extensive regimen, but it works better than anything I've ever tried. I am wearing less concealer, foundation, and powder than I ever have. My skin is less red, I have fewer breakouts, and fewer scars. I'm so much more comfortable with my skin and I owe it all to tea tree oil.",

                "reviewText": "I really love this facial wash!! I originally started using it because I'm pregnant and this facial wash is safe for your skin to use while pregnant as it doesn't have the sacyllic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it, which can be toxic to your baby as its absorbed by your skin and into your blood stream. At first I would wash my face with this two to three times a day and I was continuing to break out, I thought it was just because of the hormones from being pregnant but then I started using it once a day, only in the evening before I went to bed to get all the dirt and oil off my skin. I started noticing a huge improvement!! This facial wash can dry your skin out, or at least strip your skin of all the natural oils. Using more than once a day will result in your skin producing extra oils, which in turn makes you break out. You shouldnt need to wash your face more than once a day & even so I would recommend using a really good facial moisturizer to keep your skin from producing those extra oils. Once a day, at night before bed, and this facial wash will keep all that stubborn acne away. Now don't expect a miracle, if your hormones are crazy, your young, pregnant or its that time of the month for the ladies, whatever reason, you will have light break outs from time to time. This does help clear the breakouts and keep them at bay. I also add a little pure tea tree oil to the bottle as i really love tea tree oil and all its benefits!!",

                "reviewText": "Okay, I have a lot of different feelings about this facial wash, so this review is going to be a teeny bit longwinded. I ordered this because a friend of mine recommended it to me to help with the acne I recently started getting after changing the type of birth control I\u2019d been using. I got it in the mail, very quickly I might add, and started using it straightaway. The smell was not too strong, not too intense, just very mild. Okay, I personally prefer something a little bit stronger in scent but that\u2019s just my personal choice. In terms of the wash itself, I was really disappointed that I didn\u2019t get a really strong tingling feeling from the tea tree oil, but my face was left cleaner and after a few days I started seeing an improvement in my acne. Now, the pro tip I found, was using it in conjunction with another couple of products that also contain tea tree oil. The result, is pure, amazing face. I cannot believe it! Basically I started using my sulfur mask as an exfoliator TreeActiv Anti Acne & Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel & Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (8 Oz) which clears up the irritated spots on my skin and evens my complexion, I then use the Body Shop facial wash, which works great at cleaning out my pores and reducing oil around my acne, and then I finish with a tea tree oil TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml) that works really well at spot treatment for my pimples. I\u2019ve been following this regimen for about three weeks and my skin has never looked so clear. It\u2019s absolutely amazing. I definitely recommend to anyone with troubled skin.",
