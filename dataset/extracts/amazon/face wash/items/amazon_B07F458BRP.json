Spending 100s to find what works and achieve \u201cflawless\u201d skin. Those days are long gone\u2026. I\u2019m a mom now \ud83d\ude02and I\u2019m focused on finding things that are not harmful to me. I found this by looking for EWG verified products. With the former ideas of skincare the word gentle threw me off and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything but something that just cleans very gentlyyyyyy.If that makes sense.But I see my pores and my skin, I feel my face feeling CLEAN. It has a lovely scent. And a nice feel for using as a morning cleanser a bit invigorating without being irritating. It has a good consistency too. As soon as it\u2019s done I\u2019m getting another so that\u2019s what you need to know!",
