The oil does not have a scent and I have not had any issues with it and my sensitive skin. It does a good job of taking off your makeup of the day (with a little extra attention to eye makeup area). Following up with the face cleanser is *chefs kiss*. My skin feels very clean at the end of the regime, and it's super simple and doesn't take long. You can say goodbye to the 10-step skincare routines. I've heard that sometimes when people start new products, it tends to break your skin out - I have NOT had this issue with these products when I transitioned to these products!If you're looking for something that just gets the job done while taking care of your skin and ensuring it's clean - the oil and cleanser combo are for you. **One potential issue: a recommendation I have is to follow up with a rich, intense moisturizer because I do feel as though after the two, it strips my skin and makes it feel tight.** My skin is combination, but errs on the dry side.Skincare Steps:Oil (this product) -> Rice Water Cleanser (same brand) -> an INTENSE moisturizer(I personally use either:1. Cetaphil Face Cream Healthy Radiance Renewing Cream. It's very, very light, is clear, and leaves a dewy effect on the skin. It's hypoallergenic, and feels like it's restoring the water to my skin.OR2. Cetaphil Deep Hydration Healthy Glow Daily Face Cream. This is heavier than the first and way more creamy. You'll have to put it on in the same you'd do a regular lotion. It does have a slight scent, but it's not bad. It has the same benefits as the first, except I feel like it locks in moisture for longer periods of time.)Hope this is helpful!",

                "reviewText": "This is a solid cleansing oil for those looking to dip their toes into the world of double / oil cleansing. In fact, I went through half a dozen of these bottles myself when I started. I\u2019ve since \u201cgraduated\u201d to more serious brands (Dermalogica, Elemis, Then I Met You, Banila, Farmacy, etc) and across different forms (balms, jelly) but I still would recommend this to anyone. It\u2019s a great reliable product.Pros:- Lightweight formula, quite forgiving even if your skin is lightly damp to start with (this isn\u2019t the case with balms)- No offensive smells or heavy fragrance. Never broke my skin out in hives, rashes or acne.- Does what it\u2019s supposed to do :)- Fantastic price point and won\u2019t break your bankCons- It\u2019s not immediately effective on eye make up. It WILL take everything off but you may have to rub for a little longer and/or add another pump of product than other brands.- This is a LIGHT cleansing oil so if you have a face full of makeup caked on, this prob isnt the best product for you. OR you may need to use a makeup remover wipe first before going in with this baby.- This is a basic formula, so you\u2019re not going to get some of the extra benefits compared to a Dermalogica or a luxury cleansing experience like the Elemis balm. This is the Corolla of cleansing oils. Affordable, dependable, good and basic.Glad to see lots of others have discovered this lil gem. Happy cleansing!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars How To Achieve the 10 Step Korean Beauty Routine in 8 Steps or Less (List of Products in Order)",
                "reviewText": "I recently began a quest for all the beauty products needed to achieve the youthful, dewy look ever popular in Korea in anticipation of my wedding day. (Yes, I'm an American who watches a lot of Kdramas and became supremely jealous of Kon Joon-He's character in \"She Was Pretty.\") I've had a fantastic experience with the new skin care regimen: huge reduction in blemishes, almost completely eliminated the pimples!!!--I just get one or two during my period--evened skin tone, and overall a cleaner, softer face. Since it's been so overwhelming to research every step on my own, I'm providing a list of all the winners so far, and in what order of the skin care/makeup routine to use them in. Hopefully this is helpful for anyone who wants to venture into the world of Korean skin care but isn't sure where to start. **Indicates the product in review.1. Cleanser - The Face Shop: Rice Water Bright**Apply this to dry, unwashed skin and gently rub in circles to fully cleanse your face. Works as a makeup remover, but I'd recommend a different product for eye makeup removal. Rinse the oil off with lukewarm water. This is the perfect, gentle cleanser for sensitive, mixed oily/dry skin, like mine. It has a very faint smell of rice water. Not surprising, considering that's what it is. A little goes a long way, so one pump is usually enough for my entire face. Be careful not to carry it sideways in a makeup kit if the pump gets loose. I made the mistake of doing that, and got all my other products coated in rice water cleanser. ;) Oh, and that little plastic thing on the pump pops right off. It took me forever to figure it out. I kept twisting and unscrewing and finally realised you just pull the little plastic piece right off and then snap it back on when you're done for the night. :P2. Toner/Refresher - Etude House 10-in-1 House Wonder Pore FreshenerTightens pores, and purifies skin. Apply to a cotton pad or cotton balls and then to face. Let dry.3. Moisturiser - Skin Food Peach Sake EmulsionPretty self-explanatory. Apply right after the toner sets in to feed your face with some moisture.4. Serum - Skin Food Peach Sake Pore SerumA slightly more concentrated moisturiser to apply after the first. Yes, Koreans have many steps (most of them moisturising ones) in their beauty routine, I've learned. But it really does amazing things to your skin. And once you get the hang of it, applying all these products every night doesn't really take a whole lot of extra time. It also cuts back on my makeup routine in the morning, because when my skin is naturally healthy, clear, and soft, I'd rather show it off than cover it up. ;)5. Night Cream - Nature Republic Fresh Green TeaNOTE: This particular product is not sold on Amazon. I had to buy it on sale at my local Korean market because I was too scared to order anything over $10 that I wasn't sure about. But you can find any number of night creams here for the final step. I recommend something with green tea or aloe. Just apply at night onto clean, pampered skin, rub it in thoroughly, and sleep on it!Other Cosmetics/Extras I Found Useful/Worth Purchasing:Facial Scrub - Skin Food Black Sugar MaskUse twice a week for a deeper facial cleanse than you regular cleanser. Apply a little, gently exfoliate, leave on, rinse off. If it goes on too thick, use a little water or toner to make it easier to scrub in.CC Cream - Lioele Dollish CC Cera-VCC Creams are much like BB Creams, (not a cream to match your skin colour, but a transparent foundation/primer) but if my experience with the two I've tried is any indication, CC Creams give more coverage and make the skin look more bright, white, and luminescent, rather than simply evening out the skin tone and providing SPF. Apply before any colour foundations.Highlighter - Etude House Secret Beam Highlighter #1 Pink & White MixTo be brushed on over foundation in key spots to brighten the face even further. Goes on like a sheer fairy dust--just a bit of sparkle, but not like glitter. This isn't for a Labyrinth Masquerade ball, you know. ;)Face Mist - Innisfree Green Tea Mineral MistFace Mist is something you apply whenever you choose, before or after makeup, to keep your face hydrated and fresh throughout the day. I carry a bottle in my purse and spritz a little on whenever I feel my face is tired. :) This particular mist I haven't tried yet, because my order hasn't arrived, but I bought a Nature Republic bamboo mist from my local Korean market, and I love it a lot.Products I Didn't Think Worth the Fuss:Face Masks- These are a huge hit in Korea, and they're fun to wear around the house to get a rise out of family members who think you look creepy. But for me they're too sticky, drippy, and overrated. I prefer the clay masks or avocado masks that you have to wash off after.Expensive Serums, Essence, Bee Toxin... anything over $20 a bottle I passed up. As I've discovered, you can get really great results with just the five things I listed above, and none of them are over $15. Most are under $10.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this cleanser after having heard recommendations for it. I have tried several cleansing oils and was excited to finally try this one. This cleanser is much thinner than typical oil cleansers, but I found that one pump was still enough to cleanse with. This will take off most makeup, but I have had difficulty with removing mascara with this cleanser, whereas I haven't had this problems with others I have tried. I also find this to be a highly scented cleaner, so I would be cautious if this will bother your skin, as it sometimes irritates my eyes.",
