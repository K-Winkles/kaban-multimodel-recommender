                "reviewText": "I really like this face wash. As advertised, it is gentle, which is important to my sensitive skin, but also important, it is effective. I'm not going to say that it got ALL of my eye make up off without a cotton ball after washing, but it was good enough. I did take the recommendation to use on dry face before adding water, which was very helpful. Also, a little goes a long way! The first time I used it, I think I got 2-3 pumps, and it was way too much. One pump seems to be perfect. The smell is nice and natural, nothing too heady. I love this company and what they stand for, and I highly recommend this product!",
