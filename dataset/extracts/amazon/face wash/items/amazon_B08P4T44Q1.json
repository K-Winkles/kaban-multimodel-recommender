                "reviewText": "I got a small tube of this face wash in a product trial bundle. After my first use, I ordered one of these regular size tubes because I liked it so muchI have sensitive/finicky skin, so I always proceed with caution when trying new scrubs/washes/moisturizers etc. This stuff doesn't bother me at all, no redness afterwards, no stinging, no excessive dryness, nothingThe scent is really nice, kind of light and perky enough to make you feel a little more awake in the morning - It's sort of sweet/candy-ishThis face wash isn't gritty. It says it's an exfoliate, but has NO grit at all. It still gets the job done well enough on its own, but I DO have to wash twice on particularly sweaty days or days when my hygiene has been lacking ( I'm gross sometimes, I admit :p )This stuff does NOT foam up at all. And it's bright yellow lol which I find uniqueAll in all, I really like it. A tube lasts a while, even though it doesn't look super big. All you need is a dollop on your fingertip, and that's enough to wash your face - A little goes a long way. So, I think it's a good deal. I plan on buying more when I run outAs for the brightening effect - I can't say I really notice a difference. But maybe I just don't pay close enough attention to notice (?)I pair this with the facial lotion from the same Baby Glow line. I really like that stuff too. I also use the Baby Glow peeling pads, and I DO notice a brightening/pore-shrinking difference with those. So, if you like this face wash, you might want to check out the other products in the line",

The light, pleasant fragrance adds a soothing touch to my skincare routine. I have noticed a visible reduction in breakouts and blemishes since using this product regularly. Additionally, a little goes a long way, making this face wash an excellent value for its price. It also has an orange tint to it so be careful with your clothes.",

                "reviewText": "Remember those orange and vanilla popsicles? This smells just like it! Unfortunately for me, I don't like that smell. The smell is very potent, in my opinion, which is overwhelming to me. It comes out as a gel and turns to foam. It cleanses well and doesn't clog pores. Personally, I am not a fan of this product as the scent is so strong that it negates the other aspects. However, it works as advertised. I would recommend this product to anyone who is not sensitive to scents.",

I guess it feels clean when rinsed off but not as much as the foaming/lathering version. I don't overall like the gel versions. I don't feel like I can really scrub or get anything thick off- like eye make up. It does smell like oranges but I would not purchase again. On the never ending search for a non greasy face wash",

I have problem skin, part oily, part dry, gets flaky from a lot of cleanser or doesn\u2019t feel clean, and used to have to frequent use exfoliating scrubs and masks to get rid of the flakes and unclog pores. Not since I have been using this, which is as long as it has been on the market. Hoping Pacifica never stops making it, but am afraid because they are one of those companies that seem to flip products frequently thinking that they get more sales from the new this and new that. But when you have a great product you get more sales from keeping it on the market as buyers come back and word gets around. As long as they make it, I will keep buying it.",
