                "reviewText": "I have skin that just seems to get more sensitive every year, drier and allergic to more and more. (My immune system is a bit messed up.) I've tried a number of gentle face cleansers, and this has become my go-to. I don't normally wear a lot of makeup, but this cleanser and a soft scrubby mitt get almost everything off--sometimes the waterproof mascara needs a little extra help, but that's it--and my skin is left in one piece. I won't pretend that I don't need moisturizer ASAP after washing my face, but with everything else I've tried, I feel like I need moisturizer before I even leave the shower...sadly, that really isn't an exaggeration.If your skin is normal-to-oily, this probably won't work for you, and I completely understand how it gets negative reviews from some people. But if your skin is dry and delicate, try this: it's gentle, the scent is light, it's pretty effective, and it's not expensive for how long it lasts you.",

My wife convinced of the benefits of using all natural products and then I met Alba Botanica. This cleanser is just great... it smells very nice, feels nice and just cleans very well. Also I think is awesome that it don't have any irritating effect on my eyes. I use it with my Clarisonic and is a great partnership. Just note that you wont get any foam from this, so don't expect it.All in all, great buy!!!",

                "reviewText": "I really like Alba products, but this was my first time with the facial wash. I've used it for a few months now & I really like it. I have 'normal' skin, and I feel like it hasn't dried me out or felt too oily. It has a really nice light texture and subtle scent - I really enjoy it. It does pretty well as a makeup remover too.1 year later: I am still using this product, I have bought it many times now, and am still very happy - it leaves my face feeling clean, not oily, and not overly dry. I always follow up with the Alba facial moisturizer - together the combo has been doing great things for my face... and my husband's too (who has combination skin).",
