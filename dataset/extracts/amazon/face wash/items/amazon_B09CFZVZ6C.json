I love how my face feels and I even love the smell (your mileage may vary on that, it does smell strong). The 5 oz bottle lasts for a LONG time (washing my face once a day).My only complaints are A.) the 3.4oz bottle is NOT 3.4 oz. It is 150 ml. I've tried to order the 3.4 oz twice, and both times got a 5oz bottle. I needed a smaller side for carry-on travel, because you can't exactly pour this facewash into a smaller bottle because of the pump. So I'm a bit annoyed by that especially as I have a trip coming up and can't find a travel-size version of this wash anywhere.In addition, my last order came in completely empty. It had spilled in transit. I was able to get a refund through customer service, but it's still annoying.",

                "reviewText": "My skin is thick and oily very oily. There's not much I can use on it that will dry it out or seem too harsh, but lately, I've been wanting to treat my skin more gently; just because it can withstand a good scrub and cleansers others consider too harsh, doesn't mean I should. So I tried this. And it's drying, and dries my skin out so fast, it stings. It changes the surface pH of your skin, which leads me to wonder, should we be putting vinegar on our skin? This product sure makes you wonder. The foam brush is very soft, too soft, perhaps, and the foam that squeezes out of it mostly winds up on the sides of the bush and won't come off until you wash it off. I like the idea, but the execution, from the too soft brush, the product that comes out of the brush and winds up mostly on the side of the brush, to the vinegar based face wash itself, isn't the best. My face doesn't even feel cleaner afterwards, certainly doesn't feel more exfoliated, it just feels more dry, like i just used a really harsh chemical to dry my face out but not really clean it. I don't have that \"clean\" feeling afterwards, like my pours are clean instead of just dried out.",

My face is sensitive to scrubs scents and certain products but the reviews on this were good so I figured why not? My skin was SO dry and dull from the cold weather hitting recently. Bleh. No kidding... I saw and felt an improvement in my skin after the first use. Smooth as could be. I moisturized right away to hold that goodness in! I use it everyday or every other day and it has actually shrunk the pores around my nose and cIeared the blackheads. This face wash has done wonders for my skin so I'll definitely be buying from now on!",
