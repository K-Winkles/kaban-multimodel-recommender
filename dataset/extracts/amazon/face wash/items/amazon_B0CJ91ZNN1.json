It's gentle as advertised, but does a good job of cleaning my face after a day at work. It doesn't foam but does remove oils and dirt from my skin.

                "reviewText": "I tend to think of Curology as a brand for teens with acne (which BTW isn't exactly true- they also offer ant aging skincare as well), so even though this cleanser is labeled \"gentle\", I figured it would be too drying for my dehydrated skin. Not so! I found this to be very gentle, and a through cleanser without stripping my skin. While labeled as a \"lightly foaming face wash\", I didn't really get foam from it- and that is fine by me. I just want clean skin that isn't dried out, and this delivered on that front. For me, this cleanser hits all the important aspects: it didn't cause my skin to react, it didn't dry my skin out, it effectively removes physical sunscreen, it has no scent, it's easy to use, and it comes at a very affordable price point. I had never tried Curology products before being offered the chance to try this out, and didn't know a lot about them. In doing a little online research, it appears that they are trying to cater to a wider audience than just teens for skin care. After using this cleanser, I have to say that I am impressed. I highly recommend this cleanser for sensitive or dry/dehydrated skin.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good face wash, it's a little foamy and lather well, takes off the impurities without stripping my face and leaving it dry, there has been no allergic reactions, it leaves my face smooth, the scent is a little off but it doesn't linger. A good product for it's price, with so many similar products going for 3 times more this is very affordable.",
