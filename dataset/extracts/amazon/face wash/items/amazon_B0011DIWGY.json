                "reviewText": "This really is a great cleanser. After trying a multitude of drug store cleansers and never getting decent results (if any at all), I tried the natural route and was rewarded with much clearer skin. I used it in conjunction with Derma E's Vitamin A and Glycolic Toner.The texture and resulting lather of this cleanser took a while for me to get used to. My skin almost didn't feel clean after using it, but I became accustomed to it. (And really, I think that may have been one of my problems - I was stripping too much from my skin when washing.) The cleanser is really silky and doesn't really lather at all, but it glides over skin easily and the skin feels pretty silky after rinsing. It's also super gentle.After several uses, I noticed a big improvement in my skin quality. My skin was much smoother, plumper, less red, softer, and brighter. Appearance of pores was decreased. Blemishes/frequency of breakouts weren't noticeably improved right away.My skin was hardly breaking out at all after using this cleanser for a couple weeks. Before trying this, the pores on my cheeks had become very clogged and large and I constantly had several blemishes in that area. After several weeks of use, my cheeks were basically completely clear. The marks left by blemishes seemed to heal/disappear more quickly (keep in mind that I used the Vitamin A and Glycolic Toner as well - I think those two ingredients helped in the dark spot reduction area).I still did suffer the occasional blemish, so I decided to try a different natural cleanser but soon realized that I should switch back to the Derma E. The results after switching back were marked again; instant improvement in texture and calming of breakouts.After using this cleanser, I have realized that I have more sensitive skin than I thought; I believe that part of my problem with drug store cleansers is that salicylic acid is just too harsh and causes more problems than it solves. Give this cleanser a shot!",
