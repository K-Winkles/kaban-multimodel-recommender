The bottle is a bit smaller then I expected (photo shows it compared to a roll of toilet paper) but a little goes a long way. The consistency is more watery then it is a cream or gel, which is fine by me but may not be for some so thats something to keep in mind if you have a preference. I haven't noticed a huge difference in the look of my skin but I was using other 2% salicylic cleansers before this one so it's all about the same except for feeling less dried out and that yucky tight feeling post shower, which is a huge plus. I'd recommend!",

This 100ml bottle of liquid magic has transformed my daily skincare routine and left my skin clearer and more radiant than ever.Effectiveness (5/5): The 2% salicylic acid concentration in this face wash is a key player in combatting acne and pimples. Since incorporating it into my routine, I've experienced a significant reduction in breakouts. It efficiently unclogs pores, removes excess oil, and leaves my skin feeling thoroughly cleansed.Gentle Cleansing (4.5/5): Despite its powerful acne-fighting properties, the face wash is surprisingly gentle.

Its neutral scent and effective formula make it suitable for both men and women, eliminating the need for multiple products in a shared household.Texture and Consistency (5/5): The gel-like consistency of the face wash feels refreshing on the skin. It lathers well and spreads easily, providing a satisfying cleansing experience without any greasy or sticky residue.Fragrance (4.5/5): The face wash has a subtle, pleasant scent that is not overpowering. It fades quickly after use, making it suitable for those who prefer skincare products with minimal fragrance.Value for Money (5/5): The Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash offers excellent value for money. A small amount goes a long way, and the results in terms of clearer and healthier skin make it a worthwhile investment for anyone struggling with acne or excess oil.",
