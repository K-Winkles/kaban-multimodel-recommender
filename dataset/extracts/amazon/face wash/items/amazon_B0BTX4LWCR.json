                "reviewText": "This product is a great dupe of another brand. This is a great value buy that works just as well as the original. The consistency is a little bit different than the Neutrogina version. The N version is a little more gelatinous when you pump it out, but this has a thinner texture which is actually better. The scent is a little different, but not bad. It cleans my acne prone skin without over drying it. I use it every morning and will definitely be switching to this. It was my first time purchasing, so I was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. The scent is different and not necessarily good, but it doesn't stay on your skin after rinsing your face.",
