                "reviewText": "I bought this mostly to improve my habits when it comes to actually washing my face before bed and so far the morning/night gimmick has proven effective in that.The night wash is a bit harsh for my skin and leaves my skin feeling incredibly dry. If you don\u2019t like using face lotion at night I wouldn\u2019t really recommend the combo.The morning stuff is solid though! My skin has felt a bit less oily throughout the day and it doesn\u2019t dry me out much at all.In short I definitely recommend just the morning half, so maybe get that instead of the combo",
