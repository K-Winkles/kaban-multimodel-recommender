I\u2019d attribute that mostly to this cleanser. Every time after using it my skin immediately looks fresher and a lot cleaner. It doesn\u2019t have the best smell (smells quite clinical) but that\u2019s ok when the ingredients work so well. Also the way it emulsifies in your hands when you rub it is very satisfying.

Every other cleanser leaves my skin red as soon as I wash it off, shoot sometimes during cleansing. My skin looked absolutely normal after the balm, and this cleanser was the icing on the cake. I followed up with a hydrating toner and the aquaphor stick with avocado oil in it, and my skin is soft like butter. Probably could have went without anything on it at all. Just buy it!",

The gel wash itself is very gentle on my skin but is enough to remove my heavy eyeliner and waterproof mascara which is great, but I wouldn't say there's been any noticeable difference to my skin since I switched to this from my previous cleanser but the packaging and ease of use definitely makes me more inclined to repurchase rather than go back to my old one.",
