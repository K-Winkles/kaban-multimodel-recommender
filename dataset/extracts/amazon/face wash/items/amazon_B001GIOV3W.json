They often made my face EXTREMELY dry after washing and caused my skin to peel, but they made my skin less oily. I decided to give this face wash a try in an attempt to switch to more natural products and I'm in LOVE. When I first started using it, it felt like it left a bit of a waxy residue on my face after washing, but after a week or so I think my skin adjusted because I don't get that feeling anymore. My skin feels very clean after using it and it doesn't leave my face dried out and peeling. I feel that my face has gotten less oily since I've started using it and I rarely get acne anymore. Plus, I love the smell and the menthol in it makes my face feel refreshed (or as my mom says, \"it makes my face feel minty fresh!)! It is a lot thicker than other facial cleansers I've used, so it takes a bit more scrubbing to rinse it off my face, but it's definitely worth it for the results it's given me. I highly recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "I've recently purchased my second bottle of this facewash, and I will likely repurchase. The smell is great and my skin is left moisturized with a slight cooling sensation. I use this only at night before my serum and rosehip seed oil, and I like that my face feels relaxed and clean. My skin is very soft after I use the cleanser; I can forgo other products and my skin doesn't feel tight or dry. I still get a hormonal pimple or two once a month, but my skin is otherwise clear and I attribute a part of this to the cleanser. A little goes a long way with regard to its spread; it's thick and foams up nicely. However, the cleanser doesn't always lift away makeup. I've found this pairs well with coconut oil applied first as a makeup remover, especially for eye, eyebrow, and shimmery products (blush/highlighter). I don't wear foundation, but the cleanser lifts away my concealer and cream based products. I think a very soft facial brush with work well with this product. This is worth it when looking for a more natural based face product that is reasonably priced.",
