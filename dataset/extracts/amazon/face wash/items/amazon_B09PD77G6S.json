Great smoothing effects, too. Gentle enough to use every day. Five stars from me for that. But the acne CALMING description on the bottle is definitely apt. It keeps redness and inflammation down, but doesn't have a strong enough salicylic acid concentration to actually reduce the number of breakouts. It also does nothing for blackheads. So if you want to FIGHT acne, not just CALM an occasional break out, this is not the product for you.",
