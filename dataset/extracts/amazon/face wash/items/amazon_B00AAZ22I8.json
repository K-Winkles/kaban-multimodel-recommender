I am in my 50s and often get mistaken for an early 30 year old, but just thought I should be at least starting to maintain my skin. Also, I wanted a really good full skincare routine. So I purchased this Prescription Anti-Aging Cleaner and was blown away! With the Checks and Balances it has more of a foaming experience, but the anti-aging one is more smooth and less bubbly. This has truly became my new face cleaner that I will always continue to use. Love, love and love it!",
