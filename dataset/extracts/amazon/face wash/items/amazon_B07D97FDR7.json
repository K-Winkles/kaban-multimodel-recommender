But it\u2019s hard to find a good face wash that\u2019s not too drying, but also removes oil and cleans pores. This works great on me. I like the creamy dense texture. Only a small pea-size amount is enough for a regular face wash. The cost might come out just about the same as cheaper ones considering this. But this one has better quality. I also like that it comes in a pump dispenser instead of the type that you have to squeeze out from the bottle. I will buy again.",
