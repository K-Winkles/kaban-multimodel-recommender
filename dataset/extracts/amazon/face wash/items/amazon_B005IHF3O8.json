Benzoyl peroxide is too drying and irritating for me, but salicylic acid always does the trick, and aveeno foaming face wash containing salicylic acid keeps the breakouts at bay without drying or irritating my skin. I love the foaming cleanser because it cleans wonderfully, even removes makeup well, and a little goes along way. My skin doesn\u2019t feel dry or tight afterward. I don\u2019t like all of the aveeno products,( don\u2019t like their moisturizers) but I love this cleanser!",
