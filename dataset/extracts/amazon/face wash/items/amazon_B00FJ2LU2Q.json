My face felt incredibly clean but not incredibly hydrated and this was one of the reasons I purchased it. That said when I combined this with the I'm from toner and face cream holy cow!! My skin absolutely glowed! I'm going to try using slightly less to see if that leaves the skin more hydrated because I may have used a little too much and it seemed to dry the skin out. If you want squeaky clean, this is going to do the job. I couldn't detect any scent at all.",
