                "reviewText": "I like this as an effective sensitive skin cleanser, and doesn't dry out my skin. It has a nice, light citrus scent, based off essential oils, not \"fragrance\" artificial chemicals, and I look forward to using it. You couldn't tell it had tea tree oil in it, so I would say it doesn't have much of that anti-acne ingredient, despite it being listed. The drawback to this cleanser is that the packaging is not efficient. The squeeze bottle top means too much gets dispensed and this expensive cleanser gets wasted along with far more water then needed to rinse the face. I am not a fan of being wasteful. I moved some of the cleanser into a smaller bottle that had a pump top, giving me a pea amount (plenty of cleanser) instead of a large walnut amount from squeezing the bottle it came in. Waste problem solved.",

Blotches and bumps with spots are healed. If it\u2019s as effective as this, it\u2019s worth the cost, loved the container, easy to use and will last a while at this size. Superb performance.",
