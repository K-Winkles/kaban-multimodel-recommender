I originally got a small tube of this at my skin doctor appointment over the summer. It lathers up so nicely, you don't need to use a lot, and it leaves your skin feeling clean, smooth, and soft. Its not drying. I purchased this one on here. Its not cheap but its worth it. Soap is bad for the skin...its drying and promotes quicker wrinkling.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff foams up really well (when emulsified in the hands) and makes my skin feel super clean without drying it out. There's no scent and a little goes a long way. The bottle lasts a long time. I highly recommend this face wash! I'm in my early 40s and it's wintertime so the air is dry and my skin usually suffers. But this facewash makes my skin feel (and look!) wonderful.",

But it has a good size and you don't need much to clean your face each time, just like one tap and that is ENOUGH.Is super soft, smells really soft and leaves your face really clean. I thought this brand would be kind of unaffortable for me when I heard of it bc it sounds kinda expensive haha, but it lasts a looooong time and it's really gentle to my pocket, 10/10.",
