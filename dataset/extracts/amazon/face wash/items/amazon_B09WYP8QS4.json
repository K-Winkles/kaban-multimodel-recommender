But i recently destroyed my skin barrier and I haven't been able to use my retinal without it burning my face. But my skin was so flaky i needed to do some sort of exfoliation. This was semi perfect. So the product is not the exfoliating when you rub it btwn your hands. I recommend putting it in your hands no water and spreading it across a dampo face so you can actually exfoliate your face. If you add water to the powder and rub your hands together the \"exfoliantes\" will dissolve. other than that i might repurchase!",

Other brands offer the same results, quality and price point with more product.",
