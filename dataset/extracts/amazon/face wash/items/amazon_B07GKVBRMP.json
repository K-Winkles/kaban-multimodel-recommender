I continued to get these pimples throughout my pregnancy and postpartum. Finally tried this wash and the Acne moisturizer and haven\u2019t had one in 3 months! I am such a fan. I even paid thousands of dollars to this acne place and the chin zits still came back. My face does get a little dry with this product so I do use Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer on top of the Acne Moisturizer. Then, I apply a lightweight sunscreen and only wear powder foundation.",

It has a light scent that doesn't haunt me all day or interfere with other scented products. It only takes a tiny amount so the bottle lasts a long time - so higher cost up front (this is slightly more expensive than some of the others) but lower cost overall. It works to reduce clogged pores without drying my skin out, leaving it feeling clean and smooth. Some of the other products I tried dried my skin out so badly that I had rashes from being too dry! And of course. The best is that my skin doesn't have messy eruptions every time my hormones shift! Very happy with this product.",
