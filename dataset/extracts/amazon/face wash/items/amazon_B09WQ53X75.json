                "reviewText": "So, this is definitely a bit of a premature review but, after only having used this twice, I really like it! I do have to say I don't think this would be great for dry skin as it really does get your face clean, not tight clean, but just squeaky clean. I have very oily skin and it gets it squeaky clean, so I tend think this would probably make someone with dry skin's face too tight after washing. In addition to the nice, clean feeling, I also like that this definitely helps with redness! I have NEVER used a cleanser (and I have used MANY) that actually helped redness. That said, I will plan to come back and update this review after I have used the product for a while. I only gave 4 stars for now given I have not used it for any length of time yet, hopefully this will change and I will bump it to 5.",

                "reviewText": "I am always on the hunt for good facewashes one I can use in the shower and one for at the sink. I am acne prone and normal to dry skin once combo but not since doing skincare as a habit routine. I will say I really like this brand as I have not used the skincare before nor the makeup. I do have a cooling gel mist by this brand that I love I don't even refridgerate it and it gives that cooling sensation everytime. For this face wash a little goes a long way as I think this brand def is good for. The lather is nice too it goes from a cream to a foam depending on how you use it. I like to apply to my face dry and then work it into a lather as I go. I am never disappointed in that at all. For me thou I like to use it at the sink thou it can be messy but it's a nice cleanser and not stripping or drying. However I can't say it does anything for my acne or to worsen it either which I will take but that isn't what I am looking for so for me I will use it but it's not something I will be repurchasing.",

                "reviewText": "The foam wash does not have any smell, the texture makes it easy to apply to the skin. The only thing is that this foam wash left my skin so dry, and probably not for my skin type ( I have combination skin). Love that the foam wash came in a convenient bottle and seemed big compare to other traditional foam washes so you are definitely getting more product for less money.",
