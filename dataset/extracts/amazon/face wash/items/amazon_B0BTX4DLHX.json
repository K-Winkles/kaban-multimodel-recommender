                "reviewText": "In all honesty, I don't ask a lot from a facial cleanser, except to clean well and not leave my skin feeling weird in any way. I let after-shower products do the work my skin needs.This one got my attention, tho, because of the salicylic acid and the good value. I know salicylic acid doesn't irritate my skin, and the extra exfoliation will help. And unlike other exfoliating products I might forget to use, like before bed or in the morning, I have to clean my face in the shower. So check off two boxes - I won't forget to exfoliate and it's not costing me a lot.The product is a clear gel, sort of, but not too thick, and has no scent (love that). It leaves my skin feeling clean with no dryness or weird residue. I haven't used it enough to prove any discernable difference is definitely because of the cleanser. I'll be back here with an update if I do. For now, I simply like it. Unless I find something better, and at the same or better price point, I'm sticking with this cleanser.",
