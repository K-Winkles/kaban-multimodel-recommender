                "reviewText": "I've used Clinique for Men over the past couple of years, and I'm extremely impressed with this face wash. It feels like a big step up. I have mildly sensitive skin that is really prone to blackheads, and I felt like most of my past face washes haven't really \"deep cleaned\" down into my pores. After doing a little reseach, I decided to try a Glycolic Acid face wash. My skin has really improved, and I'm very happy with the product.The first thing that you need to know is that this wash is most likely different than what you're used to. The consistency is almost like a conditioner, and there is no lather. It's deceptive, because we're used to the fact that lather = clean. However, it does an excellent job of stripping the dirt and oil from your skin, and your face feels really clean and fresh afterwards. Like all face washes, you MUST follow with a good moisturizer or else your face is going to feel tight and it will start to create excess oil during the day.It has a pleasant orange/citrus scent, and washes off your face easily.This is now my go-to face wash, and I may even try some other Anthony brand stuff.",

For cleansers, I've tried the Algae Cleanser which I love and their orange Facial Scrub (which smells good but for some reason I don't like the feeling I get on my skin from it and I have a full bottle just chillin in the corner). They have both been replaced by the Glycolic Facial Cleanser and I'm a huge fan. It's not the strongest, but it is perfect for daily use.Pros:- Great daily cleanser- End result is feeling clean without drying out your skin- Scent is unbothersome- I appreciate that they are upfront with the glycolic percentage, a lot of brands hide this and it's difficult to find what you need (had difficulties finding something that met my derm's recommendations)Cons:- Can't think of any, wish it was free .99 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

                "reviewText": "For the price it's an OK face wash. not a \"WOW\" like the kind of impression I got from the positive reviews. it's somewhat gentle. I like that it washes off easily, because some facial cleansers are hard to wash off, this one comes right off with a splash.. It's probably a 5 star cleanser, I just don't want to jump into conclusions yet. This is the first impression of it.I bought this because it makes more sense to have glycolic acid during cleansing stage and not toning or protecting. And some of their other products just make sense for the skin routine, compared to some other premium and professional care brands.",

                "reviewText": "I have used many cleansers but I always come back to this one. I have sensitive and acne-prone skin and I find this works well for both. At 30 dollars a pop it's pricey but it works wonders. Pro tip: If you put it on and rinse it off immediately you are wasting your money. I usually wet my face with a little water before applying or sometimes apply it directly without water and let it sit on my skin for 10 mins, twice a day and it works wonders. (If you're not used to this, it may burn). If it does start to burn, I would just rinse off each time the burning sensation becomes intolerable but that burn is temporary and will go away as soon as you rinse it off. The acid can't effectively do its job if you just rinse it off, it needs time to penetrate the skin and eat away at the dead skin cells. :)",

I didn't hold out much hope as with all other products I've tried, but in a matter of days my forehead cysts have completely flattened and the skin surrounding them is healing very nicely too, the smell is good, and my skin feels so soft after using it. I am 22 year old male, in case that helps anyone else who wishes to use this product too. If you suffer with any form of acne I suggest at the very least you give it a go, I'm so glad I did, I've already ordered and received my second bottle and I'm only a few days into using the first one.",
