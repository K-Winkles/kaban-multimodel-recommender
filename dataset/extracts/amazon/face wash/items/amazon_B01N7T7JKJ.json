This does not foam up like the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser*.To take off makeup, I double cleanse with KOSE Oil** and Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser. This is an effective combination but it is drying and I have to moisturize with Cerave Moisturizing Cream afterwards.On days when I do not wear makeup, I use this cleanser.RECOMMENDATION: This is a luxury item, not a necessity. If you already have a cleanser, use that one up first and then consider buying this one. For makeup removal, I would not rely on this alone. I would double cleanse or at least wipe my face down with a make-up remover cloth or a face towel.* https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Foaming-Facial-Cleanser-Washing/dp/B01N1LL62W/ref=sr_1_2_pp?crid=HPP2NC6FE1LO&keywords=Cerave+foaming&qid=1704145567&rdc=1&sprefix=cerave+foamin%2Caps%2C93&sr=8-2** https://www.amazon.com/Beverly-Softymo-Speedy-Cleansing-7-77floz/dp/B0CGCM48SC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=7LZEC4FTKW97&keywords=KOSE+oil&qid=1704145753&sprefix=kose+oil%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-2",

The texture is incredibly smooth and gentle on my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and clean without any irritation.

After using it, my skin feels soft, hydrated, and incredibly nourished. The hypoallergenic and fragrance-free formula gives me confidence that I'm taking care of my skin without any harsh chemicals.I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall hydration since I started using this cleanser.

                "reviewText": "I had finally ran out of my 'usual' facial cleanser and decided I wanted to try something new. Among a few others, I chose this facial cleanser for some specific reasons. Number one: it's very gentle and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry after use. Number two: fair price, especially when compared to the multiple other cleansers available at all price points. Number three: I have a family member who used to work in a plastic surgeon's office and she said that the doctor absolutely loves products from this company, and he always had samples available which she of course tried for herself and loved.This cleanser is very creamy and does not lather (which is just fine - lather is not necessary to indicate a product is actually working or not). There is no detectable scent/fragrance. I apply it all over my face with my fingertips, then I use a Makeup Eraser type of cloth to go over my entire face and neck in a circular motion. Afterwards, my skin feels clean and soft and prepared for the rest of my skincare routine. I also got my boyfriend to start using it due to having rosacea and he finally got rid of his bar soap (yaaaayyy!). I can't say enough good things about this stuff, and I highly recommend it, especially if you have very sensitive skin, dryness, are post-procedural and need a gentle, effective cleanser. I give it \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Hope my review helped someone make a more informed decision about buying it or not.",

                "reviewText": "This cleanser is exactly as it's advertised which is why I gave it a higher rating. That being said I also want to note that I am not the biggest fan of it because it is a GENTLE cleanser and I should've thought hard on that before purchasing since I use oils and serums for my skincare. The gentle cleanser is not the best for getting things cleared and cleaned up on the first wash unless you have a lite amount of products on your face so I usually have to double cleanse with one brand then finish it with La Roche-Posay. However that's a good thing because it will not leave your skin feeling stripped and dry. Again, great gentle cleanser I just know moving forward I need something stronger and may do like an oil double cleanse type of routine",

                "reviewText": "I bought the larger bottle once my dermatologist provided samples ran out. I have a skin issue that closely resembles the butterfly pattern one gets from having lupus. I have been tested, I do not have lupus, but I do get scaly, peely, cracked oatmeal pattern skin around my mustache line, nose, and t-zone area. I have to use an every other day shampoo that keeps my skin in check, on my head and face. This moisturizing face wash really helps keep my face from drying out as much. Especially under my eyes and on my nose. It does not have any smell really. Its light and airy and will not suds up. If you have a skin issue and need something that won't irritate your skin but will help retain some moisture, this product is it. My dermatologist agrees. Enough so that he gives it away in samples. Or I wouldn't even know about it.Just remember. Everyone is different. What works for one, or even most, may not work for everyone. Try to remeber that when giving a review. Something can be 5 stars for most but not work for you. Not working for you doesnt mean it's a bad product. It's only a bad product if it is not as advertised. Be fair and desriptive when reviewing so others don't miss out on what may work for them.I hope you all find what you need for your skin.Cheers \ud83c\udf7b",
