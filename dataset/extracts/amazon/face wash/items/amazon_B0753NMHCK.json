I mainly just use the face wash now alongside Cetaphil for removing makeup and a face moisturizer / serum. This face wash has super fine exfoliating beads that don\u2019t scratch or harm your skin while seemingly removing some dry / dead skin. Your face 100% feels refreshed and clean after using this. I use it maybe 3-4 times a week, mainly on the days I wear makeup. Although I wish the price was a little better I do highly recommend.",

But if you have super-sensitive skin like I do well this is not the product for you. Simply because after 2 and a half days of use my face and chin broke out in hives and I was itching like crazy. I had to stop using it and until now the itching is less but the rash haven't cleared. As I said great product",
