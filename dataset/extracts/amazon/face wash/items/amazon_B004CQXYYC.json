I tried 8 or 9 other \u201cgentle/sensitive\u201d face washes. Thought I would have to settle for second choice. I came across Olay\u2019s gentle face wash by accident and I am so glad! Because this exceeds even Aveeno\u2019s wash. Olay\u2019s wash leaves my skin so soft and smooth, even removes eye makeup without any burning. Needs just one pump onto wet hands to make a foam. So the value is amazing opposed to Aveeno\u2019s which is mostly water(it took 5 to 6 pumps to remove makeup). I also realized that Aveeno actually left my skin feeling a little tight. I felt a little pulling when I smiled. I immediately bought another set and will toss my last bottle of Aveeno which I was hoarding.",
