I am allergic to a lot but not particularly sensitive to strong stuff so I\u2019m not the best source for how this performs on normal sensitive skin, but I have seen zero reaction from everyone I have had try my bottle. Love the consistency as it is gel like; it\u2019s somewhat like aloe vera. The scent smells like green tea, so no complaints there either. Overall a amazing product.",
