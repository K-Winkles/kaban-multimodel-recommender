Which is crazy because I\u2019ve tried so many makeup removers and they just wont do justice on taking off my waterproof mascara. This facewash will completely take it off!It doesn\u2019t have a scent which I love. This face wash how ever doesn\u2019t bubble up as much but im sure is because this is more for sensitive skin so is doing good for your skin if anything!",

                "reviewText": "I have been in the process of transitioning to all vegan &cruelty free skin care/hygiene products, and of course love Pacifica because they are an all vegan and cruelty-free brand. I have extremely acne prone skin and have to avoid a lot of comedogenic ingredients that are in basically everything it seems. I wanted a basic cleanser with no fragrance with ceramides for barrier repair/ protection and this does the trick. My favorite part is the consistency of the cleanser; its almost like a gel but also has a very light cream-like consistency at the same time. Feels so good and light on the skin but gives a very good clean. I don't wear makeup so I can't speak for its make-up removing properties, but my number one take away is that it's a vegan product and doesn't cause acne. A total win for me!",
