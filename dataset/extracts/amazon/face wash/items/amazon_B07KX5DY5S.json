I have very oily skin and needed a face wash that would not only clean my face but will also address my oily skin. This Viking face wash not only washes away the oil but the combination of the spearmint and mint makes my face feel tingly which i love. When i wake up and wash my face this wakes me up and the smell of spearmint i enjoy. The face wash doesn't over dry but it does dry a little.and I like that because my natural oils keep my face moisturized throughout the day. On the bottle it states follow with moisturizer if needed. The smell is great. The tingles I enjoy. This face wash does what it says. It cleanses purifies and refreshes my face and that's what I like about this face wash. When i run out i definitely will be picking up another.",

I was not told to review the product one way or another*Likes: Doesn't have a fragrance after washing, so this can be combined with any other fragrance during a date or party.Clean, light mint smell with a fresh skin feeling afterwards.Works with Beards, and softens your beard to boot.Dislikes: Small bottle, very easy to use 4-5 times and go halfway through the bottle. I was smart and used a pinhole opening to prevent it.Because of size, not recommended for everyday use, unless you are willing to buy several of them for the month.Overall, great product and good for the extrovert who needs a deep clean with no scent.",

I love using it and love the little trial/travel bottle that comes with it as well! I think this Charcoal Face Wash is a good value and works as advertised in my opinion. It lathers nicely but for me takes a little bit more than it says it should to get to the level of suds I want. However I like extra soap on everything so maybe it is just me. To be fair I received this at no cost because I was refunded by the company to test the product in exchange for my fair review.",

I also reached out to their customer service team for a question/request and they got right back to me and followed through. 5 out of 5 for the product and 5 out of 5 for their customer service. My only complaint is that it's a little pricey (in my opinion) but this is the second time I've bought it so clearly I like it enough to come back. The bottle did last me a long time and I like that it comes with a travel-size bottle as well, which is a nice little touch.

                "reviewText": "I've been through a number of different face washes - from grocery store brands to Brickell's. I ordered this face was a few weeks back because I continued to get irritation/acne with all other products. Very happy to find a product that finally works (i.e. cleans my face without irritating). I use this product in combination with Jack Black face scrub and Brickell's moisturizer, and this combination seems to work really well for my sensitive skin (though i know this will be different for everyone depending on skin type). This comes with a travel size bottle included and is really such a great value for the money compared to other products i've tried.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been a big fan of Viking Revolution ever since I bought the face care kit and I\u2019ve been looking for a face wash to replace the foaming cleanser that was included in that kit but not sold by itself so I decided to give this a try. I used it as directed daily and in the span of a week my face started becoming more oily and I was getting small breakouts as well. Using moisturizer as directed by the instructions also didn\u2019t seem to help any either and I stopped using it and noticed my face clearing up once again.",

                "reviewText": "I've been trying to find a good face wash for a while, but I kept getting strange products that didn't work too well.I don't know what the obsession is with rubbing sand paper on your face, but for some reason sorting by customer review on amazon pretty much only gives you exfoliating washes.My wife is an aesthetician, and works with skin care for a living. The stuff she's bought me is good but incredibly expensive. She warned me about (and showed what happens when) over exfoliating, and for over a year I've been trying to find something that smells good, feels good, and isn't full of tiny rocks.Brickell was pretty good, but a bit more expensive and I started to have an allergic reaction. Thankfully, it didn't take too long for me to come across this.It exceeded my expectations across the board.This brand has a new long term customer. I bought their beard oil too, and it's been my favorite as well.",
