Yes, it smells a bit funny, but it cleans my face so very nicely, I forgive it everything. I\u2019ve even bought another bottle!I love the brand Dear Klairs and I especially love their rich moist cream, so I wanted to try this cleanser. It is a very nice cleanser, I spread two pumps of the foam on my face then rinse it off, leaving my skin feeling clean and supple, but I\u2019ve deducted one star because it smells a little odd. I know I\u2019m being unfair because it probably smells the way it does because they\u2019ve left out some fragrance that would irritate my sensitive skin, but it\u2019s my review so I shall be unfair. If you have dry sensitive skin and don\u2019t mind a mildly chemical smell in your face wash do try this, its very good.",

BUT this is very overwhelming to me. I think it smells like my scrubbing bubbles bathroom cleaner(!). I hate the smell...but...this is very moisturizing to my skin. I am 45 with dry, aging skin and was using La Roche Posay cleanser and this one is definitly more moisturizing. I double cleanse, oil based first and then half pump of klairs. normally as soon as i pat my skin dry i can feel my skin tightening up. but with klairs i can stand around longer before my skin feels tight. Not sure i will repurchase...will need to see if the scent grows on me or not...but other than that, this is a great cleanser.",

                "reviewText": "I have dry sensitive skin and have been on the hunt for a new face wash because I have been using retinol lately and it\u2019s been drying out my skin even more. I\u2019ve been searching for a face wash that would help moisturize and not irritate my skin since it\u2019s been peeling a bit from the retinol use. This face wash is the winner. One of the things I really like about it is that all it takes is one pump to have more than enough to wash your face. It feels very soft and silky and leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth as well. The smell is very light, but doesn\u2019t stay on your skin, it smells like something they would use at a spa.Definitely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Please keep in mind while reading this: I have terribly sensitive skin (allergies that make me break out in bad rashes on my skin, something I feel I've been fighting since I was very little with medication, skin creams, etc. etc.) and it's really hard to find products that work for me. I had been wanting to try out the Korean skin care routine because really nothing else seemed to be working, but I also wanted to keep to cruelty free products. After some research, I was able to create my own \"Korean skin care routine kit for sensitive skin\" and WOW, my skin feels amazing.Unfortunately, since I bought them all at the same time and started using them all right away, I can't attribute any one thing to keeping my skin feeling so soft, my pores shrinking, my rashes GONE, and the CONSTANT peeling on my nose also no longer being a problem.What I CAN say about this cleanser is that, when paired with the KLAIRS Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil, my face feels amazing. It has just right amount of moisture while still being clean. I could visibly see a difference with my normally huge pores after a few days of using this combination. These two steps (the cleansing oil and then foaming cleanser) are my favorite parts about my skin care routine, hands down. I would definitely recommend using this brand.In my set I bought:- KLAIRS Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil- KLAIRS Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser- KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner- COSRX Tone Balance Essence- KLAIRS Rich Moist Serum- INNISFREE Orchid Eye Cream- COSRX Aloe Soothing Day Cream AND COSRX Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask",

Non secca la pelle ma comunque meglio utilizzare sempre un siero o un idratante come step successivo. Non do 5 stelle perch\u00e9 la confezione di soli 100 ml \u00e8 troppo piccola e dura troppo poco!",

I was using forest essentials cleanser (mashobra honey, lemon and rosewater), but I can see the stark difference (the other one was irritating my face, giving me small bumps and accentuating the existing ones). This cleanser reduced the accentuated bumps and made my skin smooth (which was the original state of the skin on my face). Hope everyone else will have the same experience as me \ud83d\ude0a!",
