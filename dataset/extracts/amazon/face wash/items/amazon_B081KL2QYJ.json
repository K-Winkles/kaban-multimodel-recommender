It is now a staple in our Skincare routine. It is a bit tedious to wash off when it dries on your face. Doesn't have a noticeable scent.",

                "reviewText": "I started using this face wash after it was recommended to my teenage daughter for back breakouts. I am in my 40's and was embarrassed with the 1-3 face break outs I was constantly getting on my chin or sides of my nose. I couldn't find a good wash that would stop them from living on my face. I decided to then try my daughter's Panoxyl. WOW! I have very dry skin but this face was didn't dry it out which I was afraid of! It also really cleared my skin of any breakouts. I feel so much prettier now that they're gone! I use panoxyl day and night before bedtime. I also use a heavy Cera Ve night night cream so I do have that on too to keep moisture in. I can not say enough good things about this face wash. As long as I keep using it I feel I no longer have to worry about any nasty breakouts or cystic acne.**The only down side (but I am fine with it) is it will bleach out towels. I have a simple solution! I use a white bath towel every time.",

                "reviewText": "Definitely among the more harsh cleansers out there, but it worked quite well. It would leave my skin a bit irritated and dry, but helped with oily skin quite a bit. It also smells pretty rough, very chemically, but that is to be expected. I noticed it had a bleaching effect on my towels, if that tells you anything about how strong this stuff is.Despite all of the negative thoughts on the harshness I'd still give it 4 stars, i bought it for the strength so I shouldn't really expect it to smell great or be kind to my skin right?",

After a week it was basically gone, but my skin was peeling! It wasn't an allergic reaction, my skin just got more dry the longer I used it. So yes it got rid of my acne but at what cost? It wasn\u2019t worth it. I went back and forth from using face oils, moisturizer, and nothing helped. I haven\u2019t used the face wash for about a week and my skin still having some dry spots. My skin felt so much more soft before I used the face wash. Also I have a normal skin type so I don\u2019t know why my skin reacted this way.",
