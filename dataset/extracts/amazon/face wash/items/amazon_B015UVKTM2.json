                "reviewText": "The product itself is top notch. Really great. Very soothing, easy to apply, and refreshing. No issues. The issues I have are with the shipping. Product is shipped in an ENVENLOPE when ordered by itself and not part of a larger order. This poor, little plastic bottle got thrown around the amazon warehouse, the delivery truck, and then finally on my doorstep. At the end of the trip, the plastic bottle was damaged and the nozzle was splintered and broken, with the plastic shattered. I like the product, but if you are getting it, roll it into a larger order and do not order it by itself.",

Nice fresh scent, not too much lather, and leaves you feeling clean. I occasionally get blocked pores and ingrowing hairs but definitely less so after I started using this every morning.I always follow it with a decent moisturiser, think that is a must unless you have very oily skin naturally.If you\u2019re looking at the product and know how much it costs, and don\u2019t think that is too much for a face wash - then give it a shot!",

                "reviewText": "Okay so this is a little on the more expensive side in terms of face washes, especially from a brand that I haven\u2019t heard of before, but I think it\u2019s worth it. Personally I\u2019d recommend a price point slightly lower, because for the average person it is a little on the pricey side, but it\u2019s good for a treat for birthdays, Christmases, etc...This face wash is nice because it\u2019s produced with active ingredients like ginger root that does help to give the skin a thorough cleanse, and help to remove toxins from the skin bought about by pollutants in the environment. It smells good, the scent is very refreshing and awakening in the morning.Now I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s labelled as \u2018in shower\u2019 because I would of thought that most face washes can be used in the shower, I mean they are intended to be used with water, so I\u2019m assuming the marketing slogan of this face wash is basically just to say that it\u2019s a face wash that is for use with water, but honestly you could wash your face in the sink with it, you don\u2019t NEED to be in the shower to use it.It\u2019s easy to use the product- simply pump out of the bottle like you would a hand wash, and this method does ensure no unnecessary loss of the gel when attempting to get some out of the bottle, like those that are upside down squeeze bottles.Presentation is nice- it\u2019s a \u2018manly\u2019 enough bottle I suppose, my husband is comfortable enough with both using it at home and taking it away with us.He has noticed a nice anti-aging affect on his skin also, although that could just be due to the skins elasticity tightening somewhat due to the active ingredients, but non the less he\u2019s happy enough with the results and wants to continue using it.",
