                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews, but I cannot rave enough about this product. Ever since the birth of my son I've battled with cystic acne. I've gone through two rounds of Accutane and it still came back years later. I had been going to the dermatologist every time I had a break out to get injections into the painful swollen area as that was the only way to make the cystic acne go away. In addition to being painful, it was really expensive going to the dermatologist all the time. I stumbled across this product while searching for a solution to having to go to the dr all the time. Within two weeks my skin was completely clear - it was a miracle. I've been using it for three months now and it has completely prevented the painful cystic acne breakouts. I've found that it works best if I use two pumps of the DRMTLGY product mixed well with one pump of Cetaphil in the palm of my hand and then apply it like a paste on my face and gently massage it into my skin so it really gets into my pores. It smells good too, not medicinal at all. I cannot say enough good things about this product! TRY IT, you won't regret it!",
