                "reviewText": "While I enjoy being 55 years old, I will fight the \u201csigns\u201d of aging until my dying breath, LOL! In my quest to maintain an appearance more in line with my personality rather than my biological years, I have tried just about everything \u2013 and I mean everything \u2013 from some of the more expensive products on the market (expensive to me, anyway, including Elizabeth Arden\u2019s Prevage and Ceramide, and Estee Lauder\u2019s Advanced Night Repair) to some relatively inexpensive products (such as Olay\u2019s Regenerist).I recently read an article touting the benefits of topical Vitamin C, so I bought a bottle of Vitamin C serum to add to my daily skincare regimen; first applying the Vitamin C serum, then adding whatever moisturizer I happened to be enthralled with at the moment (using the Vitamin C serum without a follow-up moisturizer left my skin feeling a little tight.) No matter what moisturizer I was using, the addition of Vitamin C seemed to make an improvement in my skin tone. I began looking for a one-step method to get the benefits of both Vitamin C and moisturizer; and lo and behold, I discovered Body Merry!The first product I tried was the Super C-22 Moisturizer. I absolutely LOVE this product! It is so lightweight and absorbs effortlessly, and my skin is softer and smoother than ever before. To be effective, topical Vitamin C has to have a concentration of at least 20% (or so I\u2019ve read); Body Merry has a concentration of 22% In addition, it contains hyaluronic acid, which helps your skin retain moisture; and green tea, which helps repair skin. Plus, it smells pretty terrific!Next, I tried the Neck Firming Cream. I\u2019d tried Revision Nectifirm in the past (I told ya I\u2019ve tried just about everything!), so I had some idea of what I was looking for in the Body Merry Neck Firming Cream: This was just as good, or even better! The ingredients include Vitamin C (although not as highly concentrated as in the moisturizer) and hyaluronic acid, but has the additional benefits of Royal Jelly (which caught my attention!) and other natural ingredients. I don\u2019t think the fragrance is particularly pleasant \u2013 not nearly as pleasant as the moisturizer \u2013 but it\u2019s not bad, and it quickly dissipates. The cream is also a little thicker than the moisturizer, but still absorbs completely into my skin.Body Merry claims you can use the Neck Firming Cream as an allover facial moisturizer \u2013 so my new beauty regime is to use the Super C-22 Moisturizer in the morning and the Neck Firming Cream (on my face, neck and chest) in the evenings. I am one of those dumb-dumbs who, in her teens, worshipped the sun religiously; I can tell you honestly that I\u2019ve seen a real improvement in the texture and tone of my d\u00e9collet\u00e9.After the success of those two products, I decided to try the 10% Vitamin C Cleanser. I generally use mild, non-soap cleansers such as Neutrogena and Cetaphil, and I\u2019m generally happy with them. But I was surprised at how much MORE I liked the Body Merry 10% Vitamin C Cleanser. The first thing I noticed was the wonderfully aromatic fragrance, then I was pleased at how well it lathered. The cleanser contains GENTLE jojoba beads, which provide a GENTLE exfoliating action; so gentle in fact that I was not afraid to use it near my eyes (which I would NEVER do with exfoliating cleansers that use things like finely-ground walnut shells). Lastly, it rinsed away thoroughly, with no phantom residue, leaving my face feeling very clean, refreshed, and not at all \u201ctight.\u201dThe last product I tried was the Super C-22 Toner. I am normally not a \u201ctoner\u201d person (except when I\u2019m feeling super-lazy and use a toner to clear my skin instead of washing my face like I should!), but I loved everything else I tried so far, so I definitely wanted to give this a try. I was not disappointed! After showering in the morning (I did not use any of the Body Merry products during my morning shower; hmmm, I\u2019ll have to check out their OTHER products, LOL!), I used the Super C-22 Toner on my face. LOVED it! My face felt completely clean and refreshed, with no tightness whatsoever. So now I use it in my evening regime, as well.This former \u201cbeauty product junkie\u201d is now totally committed to using the complete line of Body Merry products! The only little \u201cbug-a-boo\u201d I have is their packaging. While it has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the actual product, I think the older packing is much more professional looking; the newer packaging has newer, \u201chipper\u201d lettering that looks as if it\u2019s trying to appeal to a younger crowd \u2013 but maybe I\u2019m just \u201cold fashioned!\u201d",

                "reviewText": "I found this stuff when my previous cleanser became unavailable. It was no big deal, because I knew I needed something better anyway. When the soap I was previously using on my body, which was fine initially, started becoming a bit too harsh for me, I decided to give washing my body with this stuff a try... and I'm so very glad I did. It really does get rid of impurities, and makes your skin very clean. Here is my shower routine if anyone with eczema wants to try it.1) Scrub with the facial soap (Body Merry Vitamin C) and a soft shower brush. Rinse thoroughly.2) Wash skin again with a paste of baking soda and water to remove any residue from cleanser, and rinse thoroughly.3) Follow your shower with Yuskin I (\u30e6\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u30a2\u30a4), a Japanese moisturizing cream for itchy skin. The lotion works well, too. I like to add a couple drops of essential Tea Tree oil to the cream before I apply.This routine has kept my skin free of rashes since I started it, for the most part. The moisturizer is also available on Amazon. I have also switched to a whole food vegan diet in recent weeks, and I think that is also a contributing factor in helping to completely clear my skin up. Just FYI. I hope my sharing my product trials helps someone else to find relief.Erin H. for Nidus ProductionsP.S. I know it's a bit pricey to wash with a facial soap, but when you're desperate enough for relief, you'll try just about anything. What you can do to save a bit of cash is wash with the Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar (Fragrance Free) in place of the Body Merry Vitamin C Cleanser most days of the week, and only use the Body Merry one, on your body, 2 to 3 times per week. I still scrub with the Vitamin C cleanser on my face every day, but alternate on my body with the cheaper one. Oh, how I wish the Vitamin C cleanser came in a bigger size! FYI, the Neutrogena Transparent Fragrance Free bar is also available on Amazon, is less than $5, and will last for a while if you keep it out of the water when not in use... it melts. Anyway, I can't recommend the Vitamin C Cleanser and the Yuskin I (\u30e6\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u30a2\u30a4) cream more highly. Happy Cleansing! Xoxo",

                "reviewText": "I normally don't write a second review on a product. I find that if I don't initially like a product but give it a second chance, the results are still the same. Likewise, if I re-purchase a product that I did like, it didn't disappoint. However, rarely do I use a product again and it impresses me even more. That is the case with this face wash.After purchasing this product, when I went to re-order, it was either out of stock or it would have taken too long to obtain. This product, in conjunction with a cleansing routine I created, really made a difference to my skin. Therefore, I felt the amazing results were a product of the routine as a whole and not due to one particular facet. I am pretty confident I was wrong with that assessment.When I was not able to obtain the cleanser in a timely fashion (based on my time table), I tried a similar product (making sure it had the Vitamin C component). That product was pretty good, but I noticed my face wasn't quite as vibrant or had that luminosity. I did not think it could be the cleanser that was really making the difference because the other products are top notch. Still, when I saw that it was back in stock, I re-ordered. After only two uses, the vibrancy, smoothness and clarity was back, and that was with only utilizing 2 of my 4 step cleansing process. I kid you not. The 180 to how my face looked really surprised me.Considering this is not an overly expensive cleanser (but even if it was) I would HIGHLY recommend this cleanser.",
