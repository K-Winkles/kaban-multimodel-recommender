                "reviewText": "My friend with eczema recommended this product so i tried it out. This is my 2nd bottle. Within a few weeks of using it i had some noticeable differences on my face with my grease and black head issues.Its not too harsh on my face, doesnt dry it out, but the grease stays away for days at a time.Using this with a toner does dry out my face, so i use a toner every *other* wash to even it out.I love this. SO MUCH. It has an amazing price for an amazing and quality product",
