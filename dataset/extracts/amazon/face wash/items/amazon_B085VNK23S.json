This has a very fine grit for light exfoliation without feeling like I've taken sand paper to my face and the mint gives a nice refreshing feeling without burning. I also love that it washes off with ease and doesn't leave a weird feeling. This will be my new forever go-to at home and for travel. I'm looking forward to trying other HURON products as well.",
