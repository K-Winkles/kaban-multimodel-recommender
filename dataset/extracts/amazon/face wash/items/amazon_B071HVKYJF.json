It is drying, so I make sure to use moisturizer afterwards, but I noticed my acne improve within a month of daily use.",

No estaba sellado pero ya yo e comprado este producto en walmart ($6 m\u00e1s caro) y tambi\u00e9n viene sin el sello. Encuanto a mi experiencia us\u00e1ndolo les digo que es lo mejor que e tratado para el acn\u00e9 aunque mi dermatologo me lo orden\u00f3 para aclarar las manchas en la piel incluyendo las entre piernas y axilas y me a funcionado muy bien.No lo puedo usar m\u00e1s de 3 veces por semana en la cara por que me la reseca un poco pero en las otras partes del cuerpo si lo uso a diario. Mi piel es normal. Mi doctor me dijo que no puedo usar otro jab\u00f3n o cremas antes o despues de aplicarlo por que se va el efecto del medicamento. Cuidado que decolora la ropa.",

Its the only thing that ever worked for my youth acne and when I would stop I would get mild break outs, nothing terrible but still undesirable. I tried switching to other drug store brands but they all didnt work. So I would always end up buying Proactive again. I have been out of Proactive for like 3 months and Im really over the breakouts, I was scrolling through the Proactive choices and noticed the \"Benzoyl Peroxide\" on the front label (never really thought of looking at that.. lol) So I searched it instead found this and ordered it. Whithin 2 days of using it my face is cleared and feeling like it does when I use Proactive! I HAVE BEEN USING PROACTIVE FOR 14 YEARS, its so expensive!! LOL I know how well (Proactive) works for me and how fast it works. And this Benzoyl Peroxide acted just the same, its the key ingredient that my skin needed! I mix it with a little bit of baking soda and it worked so well! I may try looking for face washes specifically that has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide in it or I may just keep using this. But I wanted to share my review as it may save another some money!! YAY!",
