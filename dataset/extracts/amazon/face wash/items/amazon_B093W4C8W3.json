                "reviewText": "for along time I stayed away from salicylic acid because it was so drying and just seemed to make me break out [neutrogena >:( ] but this product was a game changer. the oatmilk great at keeping my skin relatively hydrated after wash, paired with corsx snail 92 I had great results.bought two bottles, however I run through them so fast that I'm switching to a different brand (unless cetaphil decides to make a bigger bottle). this will always be my fallback product if nothing else works as well.also for some reason the first bottle I got was really hard to lather, it just seemed to clump up, but the second bottle was fine.",

Before using these products I only used Clearasil lol but i am only 29 now and was na\u00efve to the skin care game. After using Cetaphil my face has improved a lot, I am always conscious on what I put on my skin. My t zone oil problem has actually improve a lot. My face is not dry when using Cetaphil products. Pertaining to this wash. It serves it purposes. if I have acne, I will also do spot treatments so the next day the pimple has decreased in size or is almost completely gone. I use this to wash my face in morning. Nothing is harsh and no smell. I bought it here because Walmart and Target was out.",

                "reviewText": "I dont like that this product doesn't lather. It's hard to spread around and takes a bit more cleanser to wash with.I will say that my face feels extremely clean right after using. But it strips a little too much oil, causing my combination skin to overproduce a few hours after washing. Then im trying to soak up excess oil for the rest of the day. Im not sure how \"gentle\" they can get a product that has salicylic acid in it.Ive been using this in combination with this lines mattifying moisturizer and Hero brands pore release toner/solution. The trio is a little harsh on my skin (causes peeling and redness, as the label warns it might). So I have to alternate and give my skin a break every few days.After using for a few weeks, it is starting to help my blackheads and pores shrink a bit and also the blackheads have become a little easier to remove.This is overall a good product and I will keep using it as it is helping, it just might not be the perfect product for combination/oily/sensitive skin.",
