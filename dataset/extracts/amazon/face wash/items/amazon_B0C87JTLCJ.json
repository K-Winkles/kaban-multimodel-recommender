I have hyperpigmentation on my chin and by the 2nd day it seemed to look so much lighter and this product isn\u2019t even specific to doing that. It does smell medicated but it\u2019s not that bad. I gave one my daughter and even her face seems to look more clear too. So I would recommend it and I\u2019d buy it again.",
