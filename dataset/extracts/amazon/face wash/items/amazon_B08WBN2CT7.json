The only thing that takes some getting used to is that it\u2019s very thin. But worth working around for me. If your skin is very sensitive or damaged you may experience some tingling or even slight burning, but it\u2019s just the natural astringent. I don\u2019t notice unless I have a little windburn or something. Highly recommend for a clean product that helps keep skin clear.",

I tend to have a lot of oil buildup around my nose area so I like using face cleansers to help remove that oil. I do not find that this one helps near as much as other face cleansers I have used in the past. After I am done using this product my nose still feels quite oily. After it dries however some improvement may be seen. I love the fresh peppermint fragrance however I am very careful not to get it in my eyes as I\u2019m afraid it will definitely burn. I do love the ingredient list in this product much better than many facial cleansers however. The consistency of this one is not my favorite. I find it very slimy in texture. Overall definitely not my favorite product. May be great for some but not for all. I personally will not be purchasing this one again. Probably a three star rating for me but I gave it the benefit of the doubt.",

I do tend to have slightly sensitive skin, so this could be why I had this reaction. The wash doesn\u2019t lather much at all, which I prefer to have a little lather. I can\u2019t fairly rate if it works well for blemish control as I was only able to use it once. I do appreciate the great ingredients as they are non toxic and safe for our bodies.
