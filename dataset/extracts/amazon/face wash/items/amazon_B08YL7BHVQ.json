I really feel like this made a difference overnight. My skin looked like a softer pink instead of an orange/red that I'm used to seeing. I have sensitive, temperamental combination skin, and this did not irritate any of it - and actually seems to have helped even out the dry spots while still cutting the oily spots, and leaving my skin soft and glowing. I really want to explore this product line more. This might be the one <3.",
