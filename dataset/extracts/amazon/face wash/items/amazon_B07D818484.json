After using it for a few days, I noticed my skin looked brighter and felt smoother. I'm definitely sticking with this one for my skincare routine. Highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for a game-changer for your face wash!",

                "reviewText": "I first heard about this product after seeing it around on a couple model's instagram pages and decided to try it as I was in the neighborhood for a new gentle cleanser that I can use morning and night when my face just needs to lather away to start the day or prime myself for a good night's sleep. I'm typically VERY hesitant about beauty products that I see being hyped by instagram baddies that claim their good skin is due to a certain product because you never know if they're being paid to promote the product without actually believing in it, or their good skin is the result of other beauty practices they have that we aren't privy to see ( most often expensive spa treatments ). But I decided to take a chance on this product and I am quite surprised at how much of a fit this is for my skin!I have combination skin with a mildly oily t-zone and am typically not prone to breaking out in pimples, though I'm so in-tune with my skin that I can usually tell if stress or oils on my face will cause a breakout at least a day in advance. If I don't pre-treat my skin, my prediction will almost always come true, and the next day I would have to do a treatment to handle any blemishes on my face. While this product isn't especially made to prevent acne breakouts or particularly claim to do so, it works for me when my intuition tells me to clean or pamper my face to prevent it from acting out like an unruly child and causing me trouble the following day. Aside from this, the scent is probably one of my favorite things about it; I'm usually not a fan of scents in my cleansers as I feel they add something unnecessary when you're supposed to be taking stuff AWAY from your face, but the clean bee cleanser is so gentle that the scent is nothing more than just a pleasant bonus tacked on to something so routine in my day that it almost feels like it's a luxury. If I could compare it to something, it would probably be how you think your breath smells after taking a couple ricola honey and herb cough drops, which I never thought I would enjoy having on my face.All in all, it's a very pleasant cleanser if you're looking for something gentle to treat your skin-- I personally use it as my main cleanser now after having used it for 6 days and noticed an increased brightness in my skin, something that is probably due to the hyaluronic acid in its formula, but I do follow an extensive 12 step korean beauty routine that involves several other products with hyaluronic acid as well. Whether they complement each other or the results are purely because of this product ( something I feel may be the case as I imagine that the acid would more penetrate my face while I'm using my spin brush ) is something I'm not entirely sure of at the moment, but would recommend this to people who are in the process of looking for a nice, gentle cleanser to add to their routine.",

Nice, light scent and feels clean on the skin after every use.I also highly recommend their other \u2018Clean Green\u2019 facial cleanser with moringa and Papaya when I want something to take off the oil, sweat and sunscreen on a hot summer day. Tip: keep it in the fridge for an extra cool, refreshing cleanse in the morning or at night. It will become your favourite summer cleanser!!!",

I have been using this daily for the last couple weeks and have noticed my skin is much softer. I usually have sensitive skin as well and many cleansers cause me to break out. This one does not. I personally love the smell, though I can see it not being everyone's cup of tea. Smell is sweet but slightly medicinal.",

I liked the ingredients and wish I could use it but sadly no luck! Wish I picked up the moisturizer instead on Prime day!",
