                "reviewText": "I have sensitive combination skin, with occasional acne. Before using this cleanser, I always thought of cleansing as a chore. But this product feels so luxurious, I enjoy it so much. It has a slightly slippery consistency and it feels silky on the skin. It's very gentle and didn't irritate my damaged skin barrier. This is a very nice, simple cleanser that come with an excellent price. I love that it has no fragrance or exfoliants. So many so-called gentle washes have PHA or other exfoliants that ended up stinging my skin.I use this after double cleansing and I don't get that squeaky stripped feeling.If you have damaged or very sensitive skin, this is for you. It's good for normal, dry, and most combination skin types. If you have flakiness from dry skin, you will have to use a toner or gommage wash to exfoliate. This doesn't have any chemicals to remove dead skin.If you have oily skin, it might not be enough for you. For pores, I follow up with Isntree Chestnut 2% BHA Solution.",

I have ran into this cleansing gel multiple times in differed videos and it being recommended by various influencers so i decided to give it a try. I have not been disappointed.I love how gentle this cleansing gel is on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft.I use it once a day as part of my evening skincare routine. I like the lightweight texture and the mild scent. It is not very foamy but it does a good job cleaning. A pretty small amount of product is needed for each wash.I have been using it for a month now and my skin has not had any negative reactions, also i noticed that overall my skin is less oily.Very happy with this cleansing gel and will continue using.",

                "reviewText": "I like this haruharu wonder black rice cleansing gel a lot beacuse it has less ingredients in it. You can find many products that boast how much they\u2019ve put in, but I strongly believe the quality of ingredients is more important than the quantity in beauty products, especially for cleansers.The ingredients of this cleanser is 95% natural. It is FRAGRANCE-FREE and SOAP-FREE with natural surfactants from coconut which creates fine lather for mild cleansing!Since I have very dry/sensitive skin, I tend to stay away from traditional foaming cleanser but this one dare to say it is different, and it is!Because it is mild and soap-free, it does not hurt my eyes and I am able to use this cleanser in the morning and night, right after haruharu Wonder cleansing oil, followed by black rice toner and face oil. A little bit goes a long way, so I only need a tiny bit of the product. It forms dense, soft leather which leaves my skin clean, refreshed and well moisturized. Also, it is cruelty-free and Vegan which is another plus for me!Just like other products from the Haruharu wonder black rice series, it is another winner!----Updated review! 8.31.2022Our whole family including our little ones love to use this as face cleanser to wash off swimming pool chlorine and sunscreen since it is super mild yet very effective! This is a must-have cleanser for the whole family!Also, I just found out from my countless orders that they even have braille printed on their packaging! What a brilliant and beautiful thought?",

                "reviewText": "My younger sister introduced me to K-beauty and so glad she did! I started with THE FACE SHOP products here on Amazon and after reading some reviews and finishing about 75% of the cleaner and moisturizer I felt the need to try another. The products were heavily scented and although I felt my skin was cleansed, the perfume it left behind slowly became too much, especially for night time. I did a lot of research hoping to find something more on the natural side and affordable - landed on HARUHARU. I am SO pleased!First impression with the cleansing gel; confusion. I didn't realize until after first-use that it's a gel, not a soap. I thought to myself that despite the lack of foam (which I am use to) my face felt clean yet not stripped entirely of natural oils like other cleaners I have used. Already a plus for me! My face after washing looks bright and hydrated. I don't wear make-up daily so didn't think as far as how well this might do at make-up removal, but then one night I did some mascara and blush and removal was phenomemal. The mascara melted away and there was no trace of blush on my cheeks.10/10 recommend!",
