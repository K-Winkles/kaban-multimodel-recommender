                "reviewText": "To be fair, right out of the gate I'll mention I use this lotion in conjunction with a Turmeric based soap, too. That being said, my skin hasn't felt this smooth in a long, long time.A little bit of this goes a long way, and while it kind of feels greasy when I'm putting it on that feeling doesn't last and I'm left with extremely soft, smooth skin.I may even be noticing my skin is healing and smoothing out as it pertains to some fine wrinkles on my face and some older scars on my arms and legs. I've only been using it about three days, so things could change, but as it stands right now, I'm happier with this lotion than anything Bath and Body Works puts out.One con is - I've found myself wishing it had a fragrance to it, such as lavender, or roses, or something floral but it's not a deal breaker.",
