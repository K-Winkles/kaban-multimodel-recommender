        "description": "Hello, glowing cheeks! From America's No.1 scrub brand, St. Ives Fresh Skin Apricot Face Scrub is a multiple award-winning skin care product. This face wash scrub contains natural walnut shell powder to deeply exfoliate and reveal clean, glowing skin. St. Ives face scrubs are made with 100 percent natural exfoliants, like walnut shell powder and apricot fruit extract, which are known to help leave skin feeling super soft and smooth. Use this exfoliating scrub 3\u20104 times a week for refreshed, glowing skin. Apricots are our thing, so we know those deliciously fuzzy fruits well. Our apricots come from sun-drenched California and North Africa as juicy fruits from different crops, any time of year. Our walnuts are grown in orchards in California and harvested in the fall when the shells are milled into a fine powder, so they have specially rounded edges, which means a softer scrub. Just the way we like it. This gentle scrub is oil-free, paraben-free, dermatologist-tested, and non-comedogenic (meaning, it won\u2019t clog pores). How to use: Dispense scrub onto fingertips and massage onto damp skin. Spread in small circular motions to wake your skin\u2019s natural circulation. When you\u2019re done, rinse and glow. For best results, use 3-4 times a week.",

Sometimes these old cells don\u2019t flake off quickly enough; this build-up can leave you with a rough, dull, tired-looking complexion. Enter the exfoliating face scrub! Used correctly, these deep facial cleansers can help boost radiance by gently buffing away leftover dead skin cells. Properly exfoliated skin looks fresher, smoother, and downright glow-ier. Now go forth and exfoliate responsibly with one of our face scrubs, made with 100% natural facial exfoliators*!",
