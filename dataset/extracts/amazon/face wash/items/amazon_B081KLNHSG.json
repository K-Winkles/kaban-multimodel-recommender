                "reviewText": "I weight train a couple of times a week. At times, this can lead to body odor during the training session. Not a problem since I train at home and shower immediately after, but there were a couple of times that getting rid of the odor was REALLY difficult.The bacteria that cause the odor are pretty resilient, and soap alone doesn't always kill them off. At times it required some fairly aggressive scrubbing of my underarms, which were then a little sore for a day or so.I found out that antibacterial soaps or benzoyl peroxide scrubs are effective at killing the bacteria that produce the odor. I decided to try this wash to see how it would work.In a word, it's amazing. After a particularly grueling deadlift workout I smelled like a monkey cage at the zoo. I bathed as normal, then lightly scrubbed some wash under each arm using one of those shower loofah sponges. This stuff doesn't lather much but that doesn't really matter. After 30 seconds or so I rinsed off and the smell was completely gone. Sometimes I have to scrub more aggressively with soap at least twice, often three times, but not any more.Using the loofah sponge helps exfoliate the skin and the wash kills off the bacteria. Other things (dietary changes, staying hydrated, reducing stress, etc.) can also help. My diet is already pretty good and I drink a lot of water so in my case the improvement is from this wash.If you suffer from body odor problems, I suggest you try the same routine I did. There are more expensive benzoyl peroxide washes but this one cost about $10 and is quite effective. At the rate I'm using it I suspect it will last me a few months. I've had absolutely no irritation or adverse effects either. I'm very pleasantly surprised with how effective this has been.",

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for an acne wash that works, you've found it!I've had acne all of my teenage and adult life and have used and tried everything from inexpensive washes to expensive treatments and have still struggled. This wash is potent and keep your skin really clear but be completely warned that benzoyl peroxide is the active ingredient in this product which is irritating to the skin for the first few weeks or couple months of usage. Your skin will develop tolerance to it over time and I would not recommend this with too many other products as it might give you adverse affects to your skin, such as possible chemical burn. You just want to suffer through it with a light gel moisturizer before adding any other products to your skin routine. When I say suffer, I mean suffer. Its super potent and will cause you to have itchy, flaky, and sensitive skin the first few weeks before you notice results. Beauty is pain unfortunately and this product really let's you remember that!I love this product because it does really work, and I'm only saying this because dealing with acne is hard and many people quit before they start seeing results.This is a product I swear by with all my heart, but you really need to have self-discipline and a strong desire to clear your acne to push through finishing this product. Once you got it tho, it's smooth sailing and light maintenence afterwards.I recommend using it 2-3 times a week to build up a tolerance and then you can go down to once a week once the purging ends, just to prevent new ones from forming. This product is also really good for back acne and controlling body odor also if you need it for other concerns. (:Happy washing.",

I noticed that I was getting larger pimples and thought maybe it's purging...but since March? I was still getting new breakouts - even with letting it remain on my face for 2 minutes before rinsing. I will say it helped my bacne, but discouraged that it didn't keep new breakouts from coming. I use the 4% - maybe I need the 10% option? The packaging as shown isn't my favorite either - upside down (as its made for but once you open it, its all inside the cap and pouring out), upright...this is CONSTANTLY leaking. This is my 2nd or 3rd purchase. Because of the leaking, it stays in the shower because it's just messy and flimsy. I think it should be in a firm bottle \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f okay product, but not something I would rush out to buy again if running out.",
