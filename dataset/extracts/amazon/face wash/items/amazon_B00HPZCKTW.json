He said he lathers his face to clean it, and then he uses it for shaving too. Kind of like a two-for-one deal ! I like how it lathers up and has scrubbing beads in it. The beads are gentle, so you don't feel like you are scrubbing your skin off !We used to buy this at our local grocery stores and sometimes big box stores, but they kept raising prices. Amazon has competitive pricing, and usually next day (Prime) delivery. I just wish this product would be part of the Subscribe & Save family. Then it would truly be the perfect product. Thank you.",
