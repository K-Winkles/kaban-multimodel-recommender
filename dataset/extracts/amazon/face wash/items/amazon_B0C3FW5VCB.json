        "description": "Differin Maximum Strength Acne Foaming Cleanser is a cream to foam acne face wash and body wash designed specifically for acne-prone skin. Formulated with 10% benzoyl peroxide (BPO), the strongest OTC strength concentration without a prescription, it starts working immediately to help clear acne while also preventing future breakouts. This dual-action formula acne wash can be used for face and all over body, including chest and back, helping you target and cleanse acne breakouts where they can pop up most. Micronized benzoyl peroxide penetrates into the skin to eliminate most acne-causing bacteria, resulting in longer-lasting clearer skin, and has shown to be less irritating than traditional non-micronized benzoyl peroxide formulas. Use as a part of your daily cleansing routine to assist with acne treatment. Apply to wet skin and gently massage for about 20-30 seconds, avoiding the eye area. Rinse the facial cleanser and body cleanser thoroughly and pat dry for best results. Start with one application daily and gradually increase to two or three times a day as needed.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this for about 3 weeks after suffering huge breakouts around my cheeks/chin & neck for the last 2-3 months. It works but it's very important to not overdo it at first.1. Start off with once a day & gradually work your way to twice towards the end of the first week2. PROTECT YOUR EYES! I had to coat all around my eyes with Vaseline before washing so the product wouldn't burn them. It helps a lot with the delicate skin. Even if you rinse your whole face at once or will irritate them & burn the skin around your eyes. I didn't have to do this after about 1.5-2 weeks3. Benzoyl peroxide can bleach fabric so use white towels so you don't ruin them.4. Rub into skin for a minute for faster results5. Use a heavy moisturizer & spf after. Your skin will feel very dry if not but any product you use after will absorb very fastAfter frequent breakouts, I've only had 2-3 single pimples since using this.. my skin texture & oilyness has improved greatly.There's not really a smell & it barely lathers unless you use a lot of water. There's a very mild exfoliating texture so I have to use a little bigger than a quarter size amount for it to wash my face & neck. A little doesn't really go a long way with this. At least for me",

                "reviewText": "This cleanser comes out creamy and foams well. Didn't expect the micronized benzoyl peroxide to be so drying. Has a graininess that reminds me of exfoliating. That wasn't the issue. Washed my face the first time and the sides of my face felt dry. Second time, I felt it was ok and maybe it was just a one time thing with a new product being introduced to my skin.The third time however, proved that wasn't the case. It depended on the contact time. Washing my face between 1-2 minutes or leaving it as a mask for 5 minutes isn't possible. The faster this washes off the better. I bought this when my Panoxyl cleanser finished. I've only used differin adapalene gel and no other products from the brand. So when I saw their new cleanser, I wanted to try but it's not for me.I didn't have issues with dryness when using Panoxyl 4% and 10% cleanser when washing my face between 1-2 minutes unless I left it on my face as a mask longer than 5 minutes. I primarily use the 10% as it works better for my acne. I wanted to use this cleanser like it but couldn't. Skin barrier impaired as it's more dry than usual and stings.",
