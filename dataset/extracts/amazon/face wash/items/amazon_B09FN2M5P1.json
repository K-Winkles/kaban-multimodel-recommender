                "reviewText": "I first used Ambi fade cream when I was 17. Somehow in my early twenties I lost track of Ambi. I rediscovered it again at age 69. That was over 50 years ago . I am happy to say that I have recently purchased almost every Ambi product in multiples because I love it that much. My skin feels clean, refreshed and I notice a visible difference in my skin. I injured my skin months ago when I rubbed it too hard in one spot on my cheekbone because it was itchy. It left a dark mark which I thought was an age spot. I tried a few other spot removers / fade creams but with no success. I started using the Ambi fade cream again and I noticed a lightening within a couple of weeks. Then I added in the cleanser and moisturizer. It's been about a week and I noticed another remarkable difference in that this spot was fading even more so. Then I tried the Ambi soap bar to use in the shower. Another delightful discovery! I love the way it made my skin feel smooth, clean and refreshed just like my face. Then I followed it with the body lotion, oh my goodness! It is so enriching for my skin which tends to remain dry. I bought four bottles because I didn't want to run out anytime soon. I will be using Ambi from this point forward. Forget the other soaps, creams, lotions, spot correctors, etc. Life is more simplified now with my effective single line of Ambi products for my skin care. Thank you for your contribution that has made a difference in my life!",
