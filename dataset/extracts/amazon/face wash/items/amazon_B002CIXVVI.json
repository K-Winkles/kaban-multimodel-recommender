For a complete acne solution, use our Clearing Tonic, Clear Pore & Acne Treatment Serum. 2. BE GENTLE: Don't over-wash or use too much cleanser. Irritation can make acne worse. The harder you rub, touch, squeeze or poke, the more irritated your skin can become - and that means more ache. So be gentle with your skin at all times, especially while washing. 3. LESS IS MORE: Using more products is not better. Actually, if you use too much product, you'll probably make your skin worse. Start off slowly, using only a small amount of product as needed per use.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for all those thousands of other women out there who have experienced the same frustrations. I am 47 years old, and I never had skin problems until I got into my mid-40s. Suddenly, I began getting embarrassing, painful acne along my cheeks and jawlines. I tried everything, from dermatologist-prescribed medications to expensive products sold on those infomercials. I tried it all and wasted so much money, as nothing worked. My skin is very sensitive to just about everything -- oils, alcohols, fragrances. Nothing cleared up my skin. My biggest problem was this--all those products out there that are designed to clear acne -- they are too harsh on my nearly 50-year-old skin! They turn my skin to leather. I used to use ProActiv even, but it was too rough on my skin. I came across the Exposed Skincare line, and I can't tell you enough just how wonderful it is. It not only cleared up my skin right away, but it leaves my skin so soft and smooth. I've found nothing like it EVER ,and I have tried every single thing out there. What I like most is this -- so many product lines instruct you to use their product for a month before you see positive results, claiming that you have to give the products time to remove all those toxins from your skin. They warn that your skin will get worse before it gets better! I have found this to be so annoying, because I don't want to give a product a month to get results, because I never know if the product is truly pulling out the toxins from my skin or if I'm having a reaction to it. Even more frustrating is when you give a product a month to work, and it doesn't, and then you can't even return it because you have passed the 30-day guarantee period! The shocking thing with Exposed Skincare is that I found that it worked right away. Within days, it began to clear up my skin, and again, it leaves your skin so soft and smooth. I only wish that the company would sell the product in much larger bottles; other than this, I strongly urge any woman in their mid-40s who are suffering with bad skin to give this a try.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: It's been about a month longer than my first review, and I've decided to come back and update since acne wash isn't really something you can review once in the early stages and never come back to. Like I said before, the was works very slowly (again I only used the face wash) and after a few weeks it seems to sort of just stopped getting rid of the acne, and is just keeping my face toned down in any redness and big serious pimples. It definitely did not get rid of my acne, but it helped. Most washes seem to just help and then stop, and this seems to be one of them :/PREVIOUS REVIEW:I don't have much to complain about with the Exposed Facial Cleanser. It's mostly natural, has softened my skin, reduced redness, reduced acne, fragrance free (there's a little smell to it, but it's not an artificial smell, just the smell of the wash itself), and overall a good face wash.Do I think it's worth $15 plus $5 shipping? No. But it has improved my skin. I started using it a few weeks ago, maybe about 3? A month? Nothing more than that, and I started its use during a bad wave of deep, under the skin pimples that are in general a pain to get rid of, no matter what you use.It has taken a few weeks to take effect, and to be fair, I have ONLY been using this face wash and NOT the whole kit (I can't afford the $50+ price for it!) So maybe that is a factor to why it's been such a slow process, and why it hasn't cleared my skin completely.My only issues are, other than the price, that it seems to work very slowly (as I still have the acne I've been trying to get rid of, but again it's not just a regular zit, very deep under my skin), and I'll admit I sort of \"cheated\" on it by using my previous foaming Biore face wash to give it a bit of a boost, which really seemed to help actually. After that it was smooth sailing. Lastly, it did dry out the corners of my mouth, but was solved with some extra moisturizer.Overall, I am happy with this face wash, but I don't know if I will be able to use it regularly because it's so expensive. $20 isn't much, but it's only 4 ounces (I could have sworn that before I ordered it, it said it was 6 ounces!)My skin wasn't too bad before so hopefully I won't have to use this on a regular basis to keep my skin clearer, and adjusting my diet and some extra moisturizer will help!",
