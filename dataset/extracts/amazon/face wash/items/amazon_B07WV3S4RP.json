I really like the slight cooling sensation, both during gentle lathering wash using fingers and after through splashing rinse. After I gently pat face dry with clean, soft cloth, my face is smooth, pores are minimized, and my face feels wonderful. I plan to use this facial cleanser in the morning, because it is so pleasant and invigorating. And I am trying out other Biore facial cleansers for evening when I'm washing face to remove liquid foundation and other makeup. I'm trying to get a routine down, because I noticed the facial cloths of another brand I was using in evening weren't adequately cleaning my face and increased blemishes and blackheads.",
