I have very sensitive skin so I was hesitant at first given that it is exfoliating, however it is not too abrasive at all! I would recommend starting off using it a few times a week to see how your skin reacts. The smell is good too (has a bit of a licorice smell).",

It has worked wonders for my skin, leaving it feeling incredibly smooth and refreshed. The glycolic acid gently exfoliates, effectively removing dead skin cells and impurities, revealing a brighter complexion. What I love most is its ability to tackle blemishes and uneven skin texture, making my skin appear more even-toned and radiant. Despite its potency, it's gentle enough for regular use without causing dryness or irritation. A must-have for anyone looking to revitalize their skin with a reliable and effective exfoliating cleanser!",

I only use a small amount (barely squeezing the tube) and it lathers up enough to clean my whole face and chin. I probably won't have to buy it again for a year but I definitely will buy it again. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I've had no breakouts or other negative effects.",

The only problom I would have is that after, although it leaves ur skin super soft and smooth, it does make ur skin dry. So I would reccomend buying some sort of moisturizer with this product. Overall, I see great potential and results with this cleanser. Will buy again!!",
