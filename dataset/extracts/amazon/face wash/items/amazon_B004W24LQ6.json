It is mainly natural ingredients, leaping bunny certified (meaning it is cruelty-free) & responsible resourcing-it states all that on the back of the tube. My skin has always been sensitive and reactive and especially in winter with dry indoor heating and cold outdoor winds. I need a cleanser that is fragrance-free and isn't foaming so it doesn't strip my skin of moisture or make it rough and red. This cleanser contains aloe which adds some moisturizing properties. I dampen my face first apply a small of amount of cleanser to clean my face working it in circular motions with my fingertips. The cleanser is rather thick but I have found removing it with a damp washcloth works well. I allow my face to dry then apply treatment or moisturizer (always use sunscreen during the day). For someone that had former skin issues my skin looks better and gets noticed. It is an economical way to keep my face clean andthere are no parabens or phthalates in this cleanser either.",

                "reviewText": "It takes me a very long time to decide on products especially skin care. It takes day, research, reviews, comparison and youtube videos. I have tried cerave, ponds, Cetaphil ponds vani cream and others. I have sensitive skin so my options are limited. So far of vanicream was the best but in the winter it left my skin red and itchy. I have oily skin in the summer and I'm learning that I have combination skin in the winter so the other products didn't work for me anymore. They were too thin and watery. My skin never felt clean. I've only used this for a few days but so far by feel alone I love it. The downside is that it smells like glue but the scent is not strong or offensive. Its to be expected with a semi natural product. But it is nice and smooth not too thick or too thin like the vanicream and cetaphil. It took off makeup a lot better than the others as well. Did not have to double cleanse. I also like the moisturizing effect. My skin feels clea and not heavy. It takes time to see how my skin adjusts to new products so I will give it some time before I make a follow-up review but so far I give it 4 stars. Great price as well especially because u really only need a pea sized amount. I normally ignore products that say that but its very true with this one. It will last me a long time.",

My skin usually starts to burn. But when I tried this one, it left my skin clean, soft, and gave me no irritation. I would also recommend this product if you have dry skin because it\u2019s very hydrating. I also feel like the ones that have a sent are bad for your skin and this one doesn\u2019t so I love it.",

It doesn\u2019t work well to take makeup off so I like to use this in the morning and something that lathers at night. For night I like to use Burt\u2019s bees liquid acne face wash, Clinique, or purity made simple. I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019ve struggled with acne since my teens but following this routine + a weekly mask and daily toner, and of course a good moisturizer, my skins never looked better. I realized using acne face wash everyday was just making matters worse.This is super moisturizing, very gentle, and exactly what I needed",

El cambio lo not\u00e9 como al mes de usarlo. Tiene una consistencia de crema, no hace espuma, por lo que al principio cuesta acostumbrarse, pero nada del otro mundo.
