It\u2019s supposed to be \u201cbrightening\u201d my dark spots, which is hasn\u2019t done. The main aspect to this product that sets it apart from others is that it burns and BURNS if it gets into your eyes, like more than regular bar soap does. It\u2019s too late for me to return it, and I hate to waste it, so I\u2019ve decided to use it on my neck and d\u00e9colletage instead of my face. If I had the pain tolerance I\u2019d shoot and upload a video of me screaming and stamping in pain as this face wash (that I\u2019m also using to wash off my eye makeup) sneaks through my eyelids and onto my eye - oh no. I will go back to my absolute fav face wash which is PONDS Makeup Remover Cold Cream. That product is wonderful and never once has burned my eyes if it gets in them, and absolutely removes all my eye makeup and also moisturizes my face!",
