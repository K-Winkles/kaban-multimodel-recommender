                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace the discontinued Aveeno wash made to relieve redness-prone, sensitive skin.It is okay, but my face breaks out more with this soap than it did with using the discontinued kind. Other than that, it is gentle, non-irritating, non-drying nor oily, has little scent to it, and it rinses off well, and is the best wash I've found for not drying out, irritating, etc. my sensitivite skin since the discontinued kind.This pump bottle needs improvement. It leaks badly when traveling. I've tried taping it, squeezing air out of the bottle, turning the dispenser nozzle, etc. but nothing seems to work, and I lose half the product into the ziplock bag I put it in (put it in its own bag or it will be all over everything else, too.)The nozzle pump also starts to get stuck in the down position after awhile, so you have to set it down and use two hands when this happens. Aggravating, but not enough to make me stop using it (although if they'd bring back the redness relief kind I'd drop it in a heartbeat).",

                "reviewText": "Glad to share info on this particular product. As my skin ages, it needs more attention. This product has improved it immensely.many tell me I don\u2019t look my age. Light feeling but covers with a small amount of product. Plus the redness in my skin has calmed and looks less irritated. Personally, it is the best that I have ever used.",

                "reviewText": "When I first used them, I had very bad rash skin reaction. I backed off and applied Aveeno Red Calm & Restore and it healed really quickly. So, I thought, I start using it again mixed with AVEENO RED Calm + Restore Redness Relief Moisturizing Cream,. I did this for one week so my skin will get use to the retinol. 2nd week I started applying the whole Retinol capsule directly into my face and neck, one capsule each part. and waited for 10 min for it to absorbed into my skin, then I applied the Aveeno Redness relief cream to avoid skin reaction. Ladies, what a huge difference on my lines and wrinkles. So, I kept doing it this way every night for one week, UNBELIEVABLE RESULT! My lines are about 70% gone in one week applying it directly onto my skin,10-15 minutes later I apllied the aveeno so that I avoid any reactions. Im only in my FIRST week. I can't imagine how I look in 3 weeks! This is much cheaper than botox! I didnt take a pic, I wish I did. But I maybe able to find an old photo few months old and also show the after photos. I will update.",
