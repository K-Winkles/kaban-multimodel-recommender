I cringe at many salespeople. I\u2019d describe myself as a more skeptical consumer who often bucks the consensus.Now I must start out by saying-i have been drinking more water lately. I drink 2-3 glasses per day as opposed to before when i was just always dehydrated. I\u2019ve also used some oil on my face sporadically.Anyhow, one day I looked in the mirror and my skin was truly radiant. It was like the color was in my face again. I wondered if I still h\u00e2d make-up on! Then I struggled to remember if I went tanning, but it was raining last week. After using this produc\u021b I feel more comfortable going make-up free for the first time in 8-10 years. I have very sensitive, combina\u021bion skin.I have to say I was surprised! It seems \u021bo be a good product. Not sure how much that means anymore... Lol",
