                "reviewText": "Why I like this facial cleanser. So...I have used the cream cleansers and the oil based cleansers during both my day and night time routine and I have to say for me, this is the best cleanser for simplification to part of my skin care routine.Now typically if you have dry skin or are into \"anti-aging\" you would consider a cream or oil based cleanser, do find what works best for you. But this is why I dig the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle daily cleanser.So I am into the anti-aging skin care regimens, but I often found that some cleanser were not cleaning the make up or oils from my skin and that would result in breakouts or the need to go through the cleansing routine again. So I was looking for something that would clean well, but not dry and destroy my skin. I should also mention that I have oilier skin and I love a good routine.I discovered this cleanser from my sister and after giving it a try I can tell you, it cleanses wonderfully and it is the least expensive product in my arsenal of skin care, it is nice to give my budget a break by using this product.So if you have 40+ year old skin, want a simple cleanser that works and is easy on the budget, I would recommend this Neutrogena cleanser. Did I mention it doesn't have any scent? Well I love a hypo-allergenic product you all know we do not need those synthetic perfumes anywhere near our our skin.Keep it simple, give it a try and don't forget to moisturize and hydrate after your cleansing routine ;)",
