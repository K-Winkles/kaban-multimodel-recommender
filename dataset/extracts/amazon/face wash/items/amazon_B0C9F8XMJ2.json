The scent isn\u2019t too noticeable and this feels light and gentle on my skin. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s dried my skin out at all and it leaves me feeling pretty clean.

I mostly use it in the shower, but quickly realized I need to just put it on one hand and then onto my face, and not rub it between my hands first or it gets too watered down. Using it at the sink I can rub it on both hands and then onto my face. When I used it at the sink I could tell it was drying. I put on a serum and lotion after it anyways though, so it isn't an issue for me. The ingredients do have a scent that isn't very good, but it is light and goes away quickly, so it's tolerable. I have tried out a Face Shop cleanser similar to this lately that also works well, and maybe a tad better even, but that other one smells so strongly that I think I prefer this one overall. Both are good though.",
