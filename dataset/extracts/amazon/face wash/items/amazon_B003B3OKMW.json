                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this face wash, I have mostly dry skin but also have really sensitive skin and anything makes me get mini breakouts. This is one of the only face washes that does not make my face react! It also is amazing at taking off makeup, I don't even need a makeup remover. The smell is pleasant and I like the micro exfoliator in it. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't help my dry spots at all and they still look dry, but other than that, I won't use a different product because this is so reliable!!",

                "reviewText": "I'd been using various natural face washes...I think the last one was Alba with fruit enzymes. There was another one with an orange scent, and I can't remember the rest. Basically all unremarkable. Until this. I saw this on Pinterest, and thought to give it a try. I absolutely LOVE it. I use it in my evening shower.Make sure your face is wet. If you start with a wet face, you only need a dab the size of a pinto bean or a large pea. It goes on slick, like a gel. It smears all over your face quickly. If you use it this way, one bottle will last a long time. It took my make-up off. I don't wear waterproof mascara, just regular. It took it off, without leaving black rings underneath my eyes. It has small bits of grit in it, but there doesn't seem to be enough to exfoliate. I don't love the gritty particles, but that's just me. (If I wanted to exfoliate, they have a scrub).Overall, I'm just pleased with how clean my face feels after I use it. It doesn't dry my skin out too much. I have gone without a moisturizer after using it, without feeling too tight. Like I said, my previous natural face washes have been unremarkable. this one stands out.",

                "reviewText": "Both my teenage daughter and I have started using this cleanser. We would usually use a natural glycerin bar soap, but I bought the lotion from this line and loved it so I thought I would try the cleanser too. Glad I did. We have used this for the past week or two and it doesn't seem to clog pores and it doesn't smell bad. It has a very slight tingly effect that is very nice. Our faces feel smooth and clean. We both use the Clairsonic (we LOVE our Clairsonics) and it this is a great cleanser to use with it. I would recommend this to anyone who uses natural products. It's a keeper!",

A little bit goes a long way - it foams up nicely......just watch your hair. Occasionally, when I wash my face in the morning, I get some of this in my hairline. Since it's so bubbly it's hard to get out, and it dries hard.",

It is gentle, non-irritating, refreshing and smells great without an overpowering fragrance. A small amount (rubbed between your palms) makes a nice thick creamy lather for your face. I am very happy with this product, I will purchase it again when I need to. I got the double pack, and it will stay fresh up to 2015. I like that they provide the customer with an experation date. I also like the Himalaya Walnut&Wood Apple Face Scrub that I have been using. ~Thanks!!",
