                "reviewText": "My daughter started getting bad acne when she went to college she was a student athlete. We tried EVERYTHING she is allergic to benzoyl peroxide. We tried tea tree oil.,essential ouls all sorts of lotions and potions, acupuncture, masks, facials you name it\u2026when I say we tried everything. It was affecting my daughters self confidence, she didn\u2019t want to go out in public. A much younger coworker (newly college grad) said she suffered same thing in college and suggested differin gel, it use to be by prescription only but had recently became OTC. This stuff works. She couldn\u2019t use the spot treatments to see immediate results bc they contain benzoyl peroxide. She used the face wash. It works from inside out so it does take time. It will get worse before better. Again it\u2019s changing your skin from inside out. I PROMISE it will start working my daughter skin is clear now. Anyone struggling with acne please try this. I cannot say it enough STICK WITH IT, even when you see more pimples or your skin dries out DO NOT get discouraged because that means it working stick with it I PROMISE it works.",

It\u2019s not a thick soap it\u2019s thin so you don\u2019t need to use a lot. The bottle will last you long. I use it every other day.

Overall, it's an well-rounded cleanser BUT.......it smells like \"Cetaphil\", looks like \"Cetaphil\" and feels just like \"Cetaphil\". Hold up wait, there's more!....... It even has the SAME ingredients as the \"Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser\"!!!!!!!Given that both products are manufactured from the same laboratory (Galderma). People are probably paying twice for the same product/ingredients and unaware of these shenanigan's. BUT.....atleast it's sold at half the price of \"Cetaphil\", for that......I have no complaints. I'll keep buying it! Lol!",
