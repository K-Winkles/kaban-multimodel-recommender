I recently began using tretinoin cream so I wanted a simple oil free face wash. This stuff is wonderful!!! It lathers really nicely and I only need a dime sized amount for my entire face. I'll probably stick with this face wash for many years to come.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried probably a hundred different face washes for my dry, red skin. I either become oily or irritated or even dryer. I first tried this in high school, and every time I switch things up I end up coming back to this. BUT it's not just for dry faces. My husband has a very oily face, and he started using this and it has done wonders for his skin. It's really for everyone. You really don't need much. If you think you need more, add a little water to help it spread. I use it with a wash cloth to gently exfoliate my scaley skin around my nose and forehead, then follow it with moisturizer.",
