I really like it and have incorporated it into my nighttime skincare routine. It gets my makeup off easily, even stubborn mascara, and gives all the benefits of benzoyl peroxide. If your skin isn't used to this ingredient, it's important that you take it easy. I recommend using it once every few days to see how your skin responds - don't jump right in to using it daily. It can dry your skin out horribly or make it very sensitive if you do too much too soon. If you have any issues I also recommend mixing it with another face wash to dilute it a bit, at least while your skin adjusts.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I both tried this cleanser and had different reactions to it. I immediately noticed the scent which was like a medicated type of scent and wasn't enjoyable to me and it turned me off to continuing it, so my wife gave it a try. We both agree that it leaves your face feeling clean, but after about 3 days of her using it, she began having an itchy sensation all over her face with some dry patches in addition to the skin on her face having a mild rough texture to it rather than feeling smooth as before so she stopped using it because the itching was unbearable and even using moisturizer wasn't helping. Neither of us have used products with benzoyl peroxide in years since our acne isn't very severe, but since we've begun experiencing bouts of minor acne, we decided to give this a try since it's said to have a gentle formula, but unfortunately my senses and her skin didn't agree with it. I read that benzoyl peroxide can takes weeks to be effective, and that there are stages your skin goes through where it can be worse before it is better so this product may still be a good gentle option for some if you can bare to get passed those stages without severe skin irritation. We've had success with their Gentle Cleanser so Curology is still a good brand in our book. It all comes down to how your skin responds which of course varies.",

It helps keep my blemishes down without drying my skin out too much which is a problem with other cleansers for me. I am happy with this product.",

Therefore, it helps with my clogged pores around my nose, making them less noticeable. It\u2019s for all skin types normal, dry or oily. It\u2019s a silky smooth cleanser and you will not need a lot to cleanse your face. They list all the ingredients. It was developed by dermatologist which are skin care experts. You get to nice size bottles. It contains 2.5% of benzyl peroxide so it\u2019s less irritating for the skin.What I disliked about this Acne cleanser: Nothing",
