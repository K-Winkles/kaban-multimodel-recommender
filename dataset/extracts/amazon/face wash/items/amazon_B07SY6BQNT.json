                "reviewText": "It's crazy to look at the ingredients of most face washes. All the major brands use many synthetic chemicals. We love that this is an all natural product. We recently made a second purchase of 2 bottles because we like the product so well. On top of being natural, it works well. We both have sensitive skin and this does not dry our skin out like many face washes do. It still prevents oily skin and seems to clean well. We also like the scent. It's a pleasant scent that is fairly subtle and not overwhelming. The one and only negative is the pump on the bottle can be iffy. Out of 4 bottles purchased, 2 worked very well and 2 pumped out face wash, bit didn't foam like they're meant to. If they fix the QC issues with the pump, then this product would be a full five stars. As is, I'd give 4.5 stars of I could.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t particularly like the scent which is musty and somewhat unpleasant but not completely intolerable. I do like the very slight tingle left behind but I do not like the texture of my skin after rinsing. Leaves behind a weird residue that makes the skin feel over washed and dry. Does not feel clean at all. I do not recommend.11/03/2019 Edit: After having used this anyway (I bought it, why not) it's not as bad as I originally thought. Will I buy it again? Sure, at a lower price. As I said before, I do like the slight tingle left behind; it's a nice fresh feeling. As for texture after-feel, I'm getting used to it. It's possible the far more expensive cleansers I usually use have a more luxurious feeling whereas this one does not. That said, it's actually not terrible once you get used to it. Now that I've used it for a couple of weeks I still find the scent odd but it hasn't broken me out or caused any ill effect to my skin. I've changed my mind and now I recommend - provided were less expensive. The price has gone up from when I purchased it and I would not repurchase even at the original price.",

                "reviewText": "So, like most people here, I saw a lot of good but also bad reviews and was hesitant to buy because I was scared it might turn out to be just as bad as some people put it, and I wasn't really wanting to throw my money away, but then again, I was running out of cleanser so I decided to give it a try.Before I review the product, I must say my skin is normal type, if I use make-up, maybe oily and I don't really suffer from acne unless I'm running a temperature or I'm on my period. So the reason I bought this product was because I started breaking out a little bit because of eating habits and hot weather oils.MY FIRST RESULT: The product although does CLEAN your face, it isn't really effective with acne, at least not with my skin, it made me breakout and the first few tries it really burned. My initial plan was to use this product after a long day of work since the foam and ingredients seemed pretty comforting, but no, it really just didn't feel good at all.[EDIT 04-29-2020]I'm probably changing my whole review here, but after a few months/weeks of daily use, the product gets USED to your skin and starts working, after cleaning off make-up or excess oils with make-up removers, THEN washing your face with this, I've noticed very good results, it leaves my face clean and smooth and with no break-outs!! I still have my cream cleanser but honestly I'm so satisfied with this foam one that I haven't even touched my other one since. I guess you just need to let it get used to your skin! Took about one month or two (would've been quicker if I used it daily.)SCENT: It really isn't *bad*, it just smells like citrus, and raw sunflower seeds. It's not a pleasant smell (which is good, I don't trust scented stuff for my face), and it doesn't bother me at least, it just smells like the actual ingredients.OVERALL: This foam needs some time and daily use (after proper oil/make-up removal of course) to set to your type of skin and do it's thing! Yet like I said before, though it does clean your skin, it doesn't help with acne that you already have, it works to prevent it tho! And it will probably sting the first uses. But if you want to get rid of extra oil and dirt, it's pretty good, just make sure to moisturize right after!~",

It has a soft vanilla scent, & leaves my face feeling moisturized and soft. I also love that it's organic.My second shipment was never confirmed, so the day it was set to arrive, I contacted Beauty through Amazon. They replied back immediately, apologizing for the mishap. They shipped my order that day via priority shipping and gave me a $5.00 credit. This would have been enough for me, but when I opened the package, there was a handwritten thank you note, apologizing again for the inconvenience, along with a few uplifting stickers and wooden coasters.Truly an A+ product & even better Customer Service. A+++ review!!",

                "reviewText": "Reading the label:This facewash is a foaming wash. There is nothing in the ingredients list that shouldn't be. Almost every ingredient is certified organic which is so lovely to see.The experience:It was super easy to put on and rub around. There wasn't an overpowering smell but it did have a pleasant and citrus type smell. I did not get any lavender smell from it, but there was something more than just citrus, I just can't put my finger on it. It washed off super easy as is expected from a foam face wash. My face felt a little tight afterwards, but nothing my usual moisturizer couldn't take care of. Touching my face once fully dry, it is soft, and feeling super smooth. It looks great and there is a fresh feeling like there is absolutely no dirt, or residual product left on my face.Favorite thing about this product: natural ingredients that are easy to read and understand why they are in the face wash.One thing to improve: The Amazon title for this listing states that this is for dry skin. The label itself says for all skin types. After trying the product myself, I would agree with the package label and say for all skin types/combination skin. This is very minor and can be easily fixed. The product itself is wonderful and I will be purchasing it again once this one runs out.",

It is very gentle and I have extremely dry and irritable skin and it does make my skin feel very light and fresh however I do still moisturize after I wash it off because I know my skin and it would just become extremely dry and cracked but I\u2019m very pleased with it. Feels very natural and I would buy again if I needed a face wash.",
