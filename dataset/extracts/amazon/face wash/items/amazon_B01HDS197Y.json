                "reviewText": "Great product! I have been struggling with severe hyper pigmentation for several years. I have extremely fair Irish skin and had never worn sunscreen on my face because I live in South Carolina where our summers routinely get well above 100\u00b0 and the humidity makes wearing thick sunscreens on your face nearly unbearable. It's like being coated in layers of wax. Fast forward a few years, and I now have large areas of hyper pigmentation on the left side of my face from driving in my car.I spent hundreds of dollars going to the dermatologist and they prescribed Retin-A, but that was too harsh on my sensitive skin and within days I was peeling like a snake and had chemical burns all over my cheeks. After reading extensively about various skin care alternatives, I heard that vitamin C could be beneficial along with several glycolic products for sensitive skin.In only a couple of weeks of using glycolic products specifically formulated for sensitive skin, coupled with this vitamin C cleanser, I am already seeing more fading of the dark spots on my skin that I ever did with the prescription Retin-A and it has never been softer. Even the ginormous pores on my t-zone have drastically improved.I believe in the benefits of vitamin C for skin, especially for treating skin issues like hyper pigmentation. I can't recommend this product enough. Cheaper than the dermatologist and more gentle for sensitive skin. Word of caution: vitamin C and similar products cause extreme sensitivity to the sun. If you're not already wearing sunscreen, start immediately and never go outside while using these products without applying it generously.",
