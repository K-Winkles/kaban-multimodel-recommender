The cleanser removes oil from your skin very well and leaves your face clean but it doesn't dry your skin out at all and even leaves it feeling moist and hydrated after using this I don't even feel the need to use a toner. Overall it's a great face wash it's very impressive and is perfect for daily use.",

This cleanser is not a foaming or lathering style it\u2019s a lotion style formulation that works best for dry or post procedure skin. Amazing to use after my facial peels and microdermabrasion to calm and clean my face without any irritation. Its eight dollar price point is a fantastic value considering its dupe is nearly twice that. Amazon basics for the win again!",

After multiple attempts to gently spin it the usual way, tried the other way, then tried several more times, and ended up popping the whole mechanism out with the spring flying who knows where. Then came the attempt to reassemble after locating said spring, but it was fruitless. I've used this a couple times pouring from the bottle mouth and it goes on like a slippery lotion and didn't dry out my face too much, though I still needed moisturizer after. Might have to find a different bottle to dispense it from if I'm going to use it. I do prefer a little lather, honestly, to feel my face is clean.",

                "reviewText": "I will admit I have more oily skin, and this is more for normal to dry skin types so I won\u2019t be too harsh on this. I have been comparing this to the Amazon Basics foaming cleanser, which more for my skin type. As described, this is about as close to fragrance free as you are going to get. There is only a very subtle soapy scent to it. The consistency of the cleanser is a watery lotion. It does not produce many suds on my face while scrubbing. This does a so so job of cleaning my skin, but does a good job of moisturizing. Overall the price is reasonable and it does a good job of moisturizing the skin. I would suggest it for someone that has oily skin as it doesn\u2019t leave you with that clean feeling that foaming cleansers often do.",

And this one I think does a good job of replicating the same results as the name brand it mentions on the label. It cleans my face well and leaves my dry skin feeling soft and moisturized.",
