It foams nicely and easily and you can pretty much feel it devolving the dirt and oil off your face.There's not much smell to it which Is nice and the fact that the bottle has a pump makes it very easy to get consistent portions each use.After I use this product my face feels extremely smooth and tight but a bit dry so lotion afterwards is probably a good idea. The only weird thing here is that if you don't rinse the nozzle, the residual foam in the pump will dry out and coagulate causing it to clog up just a little bit it's still usable.I would definitely recommend this if you can afford it.",

                "reviewText": "I work in Dermatology and have been using this cleanser for over 5 years. I fell in love after the first use. See, I\u2019m product crazy. I LOVE trying new things, and it\u2019s *rare* I find something I just keep returning to! My skin is sensitive and adult acne prone, and anytime I\u2019ve strayed from this, I\u2019ve regretted it and ended up repurchasing!I\u2019ve noticed people mentioning that this doesn\u2019t \u201cfoam\u201d and honestly I\u2019ve found there *is* a bit of a technique to this. First off, this does not produce a traditional \u201csudsy\u201d foam\u2026rather its more of a thick, rich lather. A bit shaving cream like, which makes it feel soft and luxurious. However! If you\u2019ve got on a full face of makeup, you\u2019ll need to (and really should be anyways!) do a double cleanse. On wet skin, I use a half pump for my first wash, really spend time working it in, and rinse. Then another half pump, and THIS is the wash that produces that rich lather. The trick is that you\u2019ve *got* to spend time working the product. Add a splash of water. The more you work it, even pause for a few seconds, the more you\u2019ll start to see/feel it foaming. And that\u2019s when it starts getting thick and rich. It removes *everything* without a trace, but also without overdrying at all. Even when my skin is ultra sensitive and/or post-procedure, this calms while cleansing and never causes irritation. The fruit based enzymes help to very gently decongest and remove dull, dry skin while refining the look of large pores and uneven tone/texture.We had patients who purchase this for their entire family\u2019s use\u2026from kids/teens, mom and dad, and right up to grandma as well! Just an all around GREAT cleanser that will forever remain my go-to!!",

BUT it does have the very annoying habit of crusting/gooping in the pump opening so everytime i use it i have to scrape out the pump or i can't get any product out. i'd love if they found a way around that like having this be in a squeeze bottle maybe instead of a pump top because i don't want them messing with the formula itself but idk. not a deal breaker clearly.",
