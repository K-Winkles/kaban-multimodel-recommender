                "reviewText": "This products has worked wonders for me! Since about 2 years ago I WAS struggling with severe cystic acne. My face was always red and in pain. About a couple of months with horrible cystic acne I discovered DIFFERIN. I tried so many other brands and they seemed to make my skin worse even if I followed their instruction and bought all their products for acne. When I started using Differin I finally found THE product. I started with the adapalene gel and noticed a difference, after a few weeks I seen my skin getting worse. I was so disappointed but I read the FAQ and saw that it said it might worsen before it gets better. I continued using it. I seen they had a cleanser, the daily deep cleanser. So I started using it with the gel and it was amazing. After a YEAR of cystic acne I seen a CHANGE. I am so happy with my facial skin now. At the moment I began to get cystic acne in my chin again but I stopped using the products for a while because I felt better from my face. Learned my lesson, I will continue to use. I feel confident to say that these products work miracles. If you are suffering from cystic acne get the daily deep cleanse and the adapalene gel and use them, if you see it worsen go though it and continue. Don\u2019t stop. You WILL be happy with your results.To add to this I do have bad scarring in my face from all the cystic acne and I seen they have a resurfacing cream so I am going to try that out. I hope I will see wonders like I did with these products.Thank you for reading my review. I know it\u2019s long but if you read all of it, Thank you. I hope your skin gets better soon.",

                "reviewText": "Differin Acne Cleanser is one of the best facial treatments that I've used. I've had acne since I was about 13, and I'm 18 now. Throughout those five years, I have used alcohol-based cleansing pads, Proactive, and just regular hand soap products, none of which achieve the success of Differin. I have been using Differin Acne Cleansing for about a year now, and although it took my skin a couple of days to make the switch from different products, this treatment has decreased the number of breakouts I used to have, the redness in my face, and has just overall improved my skin.Differin Acne Cleanser is a Benzoyl Peroxide-based acne treatment, which is known to be one of the better products to use when treating acne, blemishes, and breakouts. When buying an acne treatment people tend to pay attention to the cost, smell, and effect. Differin is fairly cheap for what it can do. I buy my product from Walmart, and it costs me about $11.00, but each bottle can last up to a month. It also has no smell and is very effective for people with oily skin because it has a Benzoyl Peroxide-base, in which it dries out the excessive oil that causes breakouts and blemishes.This product has two counterparts: the Differin Moisturizer and the Differin Gel. The moisturizer is to help moisturize your skin, that way your oil glands don't over excrete to do the same task. This product costs about the same as the cleanser, and it lasts a long time, as I use it twice a day and it has lasted me about four months so far. The gel is an after-treatment that you only use once a day after your face is clean, and it just helps with preventing bad breaks outs. This one can be a little expensive as it is a little bottle and costs about $15.00. Although the Differin cleanser works best with the other two products, it still works great alone. If you use it twice a day, every day, it will do its job in decreasing your acne breakouts and blemishes.Some other reviewers argued that it dries their faces out or it's not effective for sensitive skin. Although everybody's skin is different, and that may have been their skin\u2019s reaction, there are ways around these issues with this product. Since Differin is a cleanser that is meant to dry and decrease the oil from your face, it has the ability to dry your face out completely. To avoid this, be sure to only use it once or twice a day, and I would even recommend investing in the Differin Moisturizer.Overall, Differin Acne Cleanser is a great product for people with acne. It is very cost-effective, has no odor, and even provides loopholes and solutions for those having trouble using this product in the beginning. For me personally, I would recommend Differin Acne Cleanser for an over-the-counter solution, as I have been using it for a year and it has yet to let me down.",

                "reviewText": "I have Rosacea and Sebbhoreic Dermatitis - an inflammatory response to EXTREME stress (my best friend passed away suddenly 3 months ago) because I have several auto-immune conditions. I have redness on cheeks and white flaky patches on my face caused by a fungus that is not contagious. My doc told me Differin was OTC now and I needed a face cleanser with Benzoyl Peroxide, Differin gel with Retinol, a good non-oily night-time moisturizer, and a good non-oily daytime moisturizer with a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher. He also wants me to wear a hat with a big brim to protect my face. So, I came home and was happy to see I could order all of these Differin products. I started using them 4 days ago. The cleanser was great, the gel seems to be working, the night moisturizer is fabulous, too. The only product I don't recommend is the sunscreen. Read my review on that product page. I highly recommend this particular product, though!",
