                "reviewText": "I have combination skin and so far this cleanser has been working great. I've only been using it for a few weeks, but looks like I have less blackheads on my face. I like the ingredients and the fact it's fragrance free, but my skin still feels a little dry afterwards. Overall I think it's a great cleanser and would recommend it to anyone who is suffering from blackheads and needs a cleanser that is fragrance free and non-comedogenic.",

I recommend checking with a dermatologist for the right combo of products as this is a professional grade skincare system and deserves to be treated as such.",
