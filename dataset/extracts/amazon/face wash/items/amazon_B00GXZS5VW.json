                "reviewText": "So this face wash is great for sensitive skin. My face is very sensitive and this face wash works great. There\u2019s only one negative and that\u2019s the cap. The little plastic piece that fits inside hole that the soap comes out of breaks easily. When it breaks it get stuck inside in dispensing hole. You\u2019ll need pliers to get it out. I\u2019ve had several of these delivered with that piece already broken!So if you drop this in the shower expect to not be able to get the soap out. Unless you\u2019re like me and say screw it and walk butt naked with shampoo in your hair still out to the garage to find some pliers.",

                "reviewText": "As stated above, I've used this product for over 10 years. It used to come fragrance free but I guess some whiny \"men\" (there are so many of you out there) wanted some fragrance in the product. Admittedly, before the fragrance it did feel weird applying an odorless gel to my face but the results are all that matter to me. I couldn't find it for about a year or more until it finally reappeared again with the fragrance. This product cleans the best and does not cause any further breakouts. I have sensitive + combination type skin which is very acne prone if not cared for specifically. I forgot to pack this face wash on vacation with me for a week and used Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and boom, instant whiteheads and even a couple milia on my eyelids, which have never come up in the past ten years.Use this product and buy lots of it. I never want this to be discontinued if I can help it. I can't speak on the ingredients and fragrance causing problems and irritation with other users, but it does not affect my skin negatively. Like I said, I have acne prone skin even at my age. Only this face wash and some Glycolix skin care products do not break me out.",
