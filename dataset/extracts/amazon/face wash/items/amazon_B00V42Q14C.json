It does have a bit of a scent, but the scent doesn't linger after use. It doesn't fell tight or drying - It doesn't overdry the skin, which is a common issue with some other face washes I've tried.The texture of the face wash is just right \u2013 not too thick, not too runny. It lathers up nicely, making it easy to apply and distribute evenly across my face. It effectively removes dirt, excess oil, and impurities without leaving my skin feeling stripped or tight. In fact, my skin feels noticeably smoother and softer after just a few uses.The packaging is sleek and convenient, with a secure cap that ensures there's no waste or leakage. Plus, it's easy to dispense just the right amount of product, so a little goes a long way, making it an excellent value for the price.",

I like the pleasant smell, not too strong. The bottle is larger than I anticipated and will last a really long time. I included a photo so show the size. It only takes a dime sized amount or less to completely wash my face. The price point is also really fair compared to other name brand face washes. I can see this lasting multiple months per bottle with daily use.",

He really likes the clean ingredients and gentle aroma that make daily washing a pleasant experience and is eager to try more of the Brickell products, especially the anti-aging facial products. This foams well using a small amount of product so this bottle will last a long time. The formula offers oil control without drying effects. It's nice that that Brickell offers a complete line of face and body care items that make choosing additional products easier, knowing that you will be getting quality product formulations made with natural and organic ingredients and using essential oils, all manufactured in the USA.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this product on Amazon, because I wanted a simple and yet effective Face Wash that was easy to lather on and wash off. After using this product for over 2 weeks, I can safely say that it was exactly what I was looking for in a Face Wash. The Gel itself is not thick and heavy, therefore it's easy to apply to hands and onto the face. It isn't greasy or sticky either like some other Face Wash products I\u2019ve used in the past. I typically apply this onto my face while showering, so that it would be easy and convenient to wash off.The best part about this product and a good indicator that it works, is that it leaves a cool feeling on your face, similar to that of eucalyptus. It leaves your face clean and moisturized at the same time and does a great job of removing oil and dirt. My face just feels rejuvenated and refreshed, after each use.It is also not heavily scented, which suits me well. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I usually pair the use of this Face Wash with a moisturizing lotion to keep my face clean and clear.I would recommend this product to anyone looking to add a Face Wash routine to their skin care. On a side note, I am no stranger to Brickell, I also use several of their other products e.g. Anti-Aging Face Cream and Eye Cream.",

                "reviewText": "I've used some of Brickell's products before, and figured I would try this one. Its fantastic. The viscosity is just right, and it is a perfect daily face wash. The scent is nice, not feminine at all. I have sensitive skin and this wash does not irritate it at all. I would still use a thicker, exfoliating face wash once a week, but this is great both in the morning and before bed. It feels good on your face and leaves you feeling fresh! I definitely recommend this!",

A small amount goes a long way. It lathers up well and has a very smooth feel to it. It leaves my face refreshed and clean. A week in and my skin feels very softer and smoother. I noticed that shaving is easier as well. I honestly look forward to that first refreshing face wash in the morning.",
