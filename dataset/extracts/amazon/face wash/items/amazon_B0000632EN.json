First of all ignore me trying to record this video with one hand while struggling opening the tube with the other BUT\ud83d\ude02 this product is absolutely amazing. If you\u2019re looking for a gentle exfoliator, for those who don\u2019t know what that is it\u2019s a product that can come both chemical and physical forms to get rid of the dead skin cells. This product would be physical exfoliator since its a scrub and youre scrubbing off the dead skin cells yourself instead of having the chemical exfoliants do all the work. However. As i was saying!! This product not only works as a exfoliant but it feels like a dream on your skin its super super soft and melts into a facewash its not harsh whatsoever and gives you a soft skin feel. I 100/10 recommend this for beginners or for anyone who prefers a physical exfoliant. Dont forget your moisturizer to lock your moisture back in after exfoliating!!",

A while back, I ordered 4 at the end of BBB and while the photo at the time had the green top, when they came, they had the new black top. I just opened one up, used it and wow, has it changed!It stinks!!!! I can't wait to get it off my face and also the smell lingers afterwards for a while. The color is different, more clear compared to ivory. To me, it has more exfoliating particles in it as well.I'm sure I didn't get a bad batch, but in looking at reviews here, it doesn't seem like others are saying the same thing with any regularity. Perhaps the changes don't bother them.It is disappointing when any manufacturer changes a product that is working well. Of course, it's to save money - let's face it! Perhaps the fragrance they used was too costly.I have 4! So, I'm hoping to get used to it. I also will have to decide what to switch too, which is disappointing! I liked this product before the changes!Update - also, they changed the packaging and it\u2019s so hard to squeeze the product out, especially when you get towards the end! It\u2019s a thicker material, I assume with a smaller hole, and forget getting the last quarter out without great effort!",
