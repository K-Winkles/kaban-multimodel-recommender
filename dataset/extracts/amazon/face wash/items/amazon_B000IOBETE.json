We are committed to offering highly effective products that can be tolerated by even sensitive skin. What Really Causes Sensitive Skin? Skin has a barrier which acts as a defense against external aggressors and helps lock in essential moisture. Sensitive skin may have a weakened skin barrier, making skin more susceptible to potentially harmful irritants. This can cause signs of skin sensitivity such as dryness, redness, and discomfort. Sensitive Skin Triggers Sensitive skin triggers fall into three categories: 1. Environmental: temperature changes, sun exposure, and pollution. 2. Products with harsh or potentially irritating ingredients: fragrances or alcohol. 3. Internal: stress and lifestyle such as smoking or drinking.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for a little over a year and absolutely love it. I sometimes have problem skin but less and less when I use the right products. This is a very gentle, unscented foaming cleanser that is very effective and kind to my skin. I used to think that when I was having a breakout I needed to clean my face with harsh....well, anything. There were times I thought that maybe battery acid would be a solution. I have read in many journals that when we over-clean or \"strip\" our skin the natural healing response is our body producing MORE oils. THIS IS TRUE. With Toleriane I am surprised about a pea sized amount foams very well and lifts any dirt or oil gently and does not rob my face of the necessary balance of natural oils needed for a healthy and clear complexion. My skin feels sooooooooo soft afterwards and creates a great canvas for the skin care products I use. I recently read that the product you use to clean your face should leave your skin feeling soft not dry or tight. This is the product and it is perfect for all skin types. Once you have clean skin, you can apply whatever products you need to correct your own problems if you have any. I am 46 years old but I believe this would also work on younger skin with acne or even older dry skin since it is so gentle. HERE'S the bonus.....I paid about half on line as they charge at the spa. Great product - excellent price:)",

                "reviewText": "I am not a review writer, but this product impressed me so much that I had to write one!I am in my 20s and have always had really red cheeks. I never did anything about it because my skin broke out occasionally and was combo/oily so I only tackled those issues growing up and into early 20s. Once I discovered my redness was actually rosacea and my skin was extremely sensitive, I have struggled to find products that are \"soothing\" and \"calming\" but that aren't thick and goopy or clog my pores. This cleanser is wonderful!I was nervous about the word \"Creamy\" on the label because that's a bad word for oily/breakout prone skin, but I thought i'd try it anyway. It not only is extremely gentle and calming, but it cleaned my face wonderfully! I wear makeup and I often have to wash twice to remove everything. This cleanser took it all off in one foul swoop! My skin was very clean, but not overly dried out and definitely not irritated!I don't think this cleanser has a smell at all, and I have the nose of a bloodhound. I have had so many medicinal smelling cleansers for \"sensitive skin\" that make me want to throw up that I am really impressed with this one. Ingredient list is short (which is best) and it delivered exactly what it said it did. It doesn't necessarily \"control breakouts\" as it is not designed to do that, but it does work great for intolerant skin and it certainly didn't irritate my oily skin or clog my pores in any way. Once every two or three days i'll swipe on a benzoyl peroxide lotion on my breakout prone areas to keep them in check.To be honest, my breakouts are less now with this cleanser than ever before. I don't know if the cleanser is doing that or not, but it's definitely not making them worse! I will be buying this again when I run out.",

                "reviewText": "The ACTUAL product is amazing, and highly recommended. However, the version sold on amazon changed consistency in less than 4 months to a viscous liquid soap (it should come out more like a cream that you use a pea size and it foams beautifully). Now it barely foams and I need a lot to make it lather. I'm not sure if it's not authentic, or not stored properly, or expired (threw away the box). I would suggest buying at Walgreens, Ulta or La Roche Posey website.It's good for sensitive skin, feels like soap (in that it can be drying, but not irritating), and was appropriate for use with Retin A and acids (BHA, AHA), though I did not try simultaneously with all. It's very good to remove make up and sunscreen. Again, it's a deeper cleanser, so may be too drying for some. My skin is sensitive and it did not cause a reaction. I use a moisturizer after in the months that are too dry or when I am using some other drying acne medication.",

                "reviewText": "I hesitated for a couple weeks between the Cerave foaming cleanser, the La Roche Posay Effaclar cleanser, and this one. My skin is combination, and I was finding that my cleanser from The Ordinary was leaving my t-zone oily. (Even with double cleansing, oil cleansing, silicone brush..) I am really happy with this cleanser for my combination skin. My t-zone feels clean and not oily, but my face does not feel dry at all. Even just after 2 days, my forehead had reduced redness. I chose this one over the (much cheaper) effaclar because effaclar has some fragrance and has more stripping ingredients. Since my skin is pretty sensitive (and combo) I did not want to risk over stripping, especially on my cheeks. I am really happy with this product. I have no way of knowing if the Effaclar would have met my needs as well (I might try it later on) but I can say that this cleanser seems ideal for my combination, sensitive skin. Highly recommend, it\u2019s really good quality. Also I like the foam because it\u2019s substantial and very light. Makes it easy to work it in without exerting much pressure on the skin. The experience is good as in it feels nice.",
