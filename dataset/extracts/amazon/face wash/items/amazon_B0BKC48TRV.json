I recently bought for myself FACETORY\u2019s Urban Calm Soft Essence and loved it so much! It really helped my skin a lot and was an essence that didn\u2019t feel too heavy or leave my sensitive, but breakout-prone, skin feeling greasy. As such, I was offered a chance to try their Gel Facial Cleanser! I can honestly say that I love this product even more than the essence! It cleanses my face without drying it or it has also gotten rid of the redness that I had been struggling with for a while. It won\u2019t be for every one perhaps as it\u2019s not a heavy foaming cleanser etc so maybe for those with really oily skin etc it wouldn\u2019t be the best? I don\u2019t know. I guess you would have to try it and and see, but maybe that\u2019s just my misunderstanding that foaming products are better for oiky skin and it really is the products that are important. I just know that this works so well for my skin which is sensitive and does and have oily T-spot but tends to be dry overall. It also has redness which has been evened out so much with this product. It\u2019s been great and I will keep on using it for sure!",

                "reviewText": "If you haven't heard or tried this product yet, let me tell you. It is actually a brilliant gel cleanser. My poor face got a little sunburnt yesterday so I've been careful with applying makeup & skincare lightly. This cleanser felt so nice & refreshing on my face and helped calm it down alot. has no artificial colors, no parabens or sulfates. It does contain fermented pear and salicylic acids which has amazing benefits for your skin. The only con for me which is not a big deal, but I wish it foamed more. but this does a tremendous job on cleaning your skin without stripping it or feeling dried out after. So overall I'm pretty happy with it. I love the glass jar too.",
