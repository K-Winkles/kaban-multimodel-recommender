It is a very neutral product. By that I mean it does what it says. It is a very light gel that sunk in quickly and did calm the skin on my acne prone face and neck. Face is dewy but not sticky and definitely not greasy. The scent is amazing. I noticed that it does seem to promote healing as well. Overnight I noticed dry cracks and lesions from acne meds close up and skin pull together.This moisturizer works for me and is exactly what I wanted-moisture without irritating ingredients. Bonus! It feels cool and refreshing too. Perfect for overnight as it doesn\u2019t end up all over the pillowcase or in my hair. I would by again and recommend.",

I\u2019m 34 and have used clean and clear acne moisturizer forever in the white and purple bottle- I\u2019m talking like at least 15 years. It has been great for my skin. But now, my skin is maturing and I\u2019m needing more moisture with the benefits of fighting a few pimples. This aloe moisturizer smells like cucumber, strongly. It also dries instantly on the skin leaving a tightness and not a moisturizing feeling. I also broke out in tiny little random white heads. I have pretty great skin, and this is the only change I\u2019ve made. I don\u2019t recommend.",
