                "reviewText": "The smell is wonderful and it lathers up nicely but it leaves my skin feeling dry and tight. I have a water conditioner and most soaps are slippery and moist feeling when I rinse the soap off, but this soap leaves my skin feeling dried out and tight. It is not an enjoyable feeling. I will use it up on other parts of my body but I will not use it on my face.",

                "reviewText": "Wow! This cleanser really impressed me! I\u2019ve been using Grown Alchemist gentle gel cleanser but I always cried when it came time to purchase another bottle. I tried finding a cleanser with similar ingredients and feel but with a smaller price tag, when I stumbled upon this lovely product. It smells nice and feels great on my skin and is comparable to pricier skincare products I\u2019ve used in the past. 10/10 would recommend!!",
