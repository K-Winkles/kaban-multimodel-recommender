I recently bought ONE bottle and it was more then the price of these two. I have this on auto ship because of how great the price is! I will always recommend clean and clear face wash, they always have the absolute best face washes. The morning burst smells great and does help to wake me up as well as add extra moisture to my face. The night wash is also amazing, it has a very soothing smell and makes my face feel super clean. 10/10 recommend!!",
