With a pump applicator, it\u2019s easy use in the shower. I just wet a wash cloth and pump it on. I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or even regular skin.",

Unfortunately, I won't purchase from Amazon anymore because it was thrown in the box with other items, no packing material and it leaked all over everything. Normally, it is put in a plastic bag and even zip tie the top, so it won't leak. Amazon needs to review their \"New Packaging Innovation\" plan.",
