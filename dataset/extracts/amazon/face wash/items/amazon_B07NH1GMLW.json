I have always gotten in the habit of putting on my cleanser in the shower quickly but gently rubbing all over my face and then immediately rinsing it off because if I leave it on too long my skin starts BURNING. After a successful first run, I decided to test this one\u2019s limits even further and left it on my skin longer and decided to take my time like a normal person and was pleasantly surprised to not experience any burning sensation at all.The scent is a bit strong in my opinion, especially for a cleanser aimed for sensitive skin but it is still pleasant. The consistency is that of a light lotion and it is really easy to apply and work on your face and easy to remove as well.This cleanser is my new holy grail. So cheap, doesn\u2019t burn during application and leaves my face feeling clean and soft afterwards.",

                "reviewText": "I have dry sensitive skin and rosacea, tho not bad. I have tried all sorts of mosturizers, and usually they sting a little (the anti aging ones especially, lucky me). This one truly is calming! That's the best word I can use to describe it. A little goes a long way - if I use too much, it leaves a coating on my skin. Not a big deal, but probably a waste of product. I have noticed that it soothes my skin, helps with redness, softens my face. After much searching, this is it for me!",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice moisturizer that arrives in an easy to open box, with a container that's both easy to open and close.This is great for sensitive skin and those with scent sensitivities, as it's not packed with scents.The name of calming moisturizer is an accurate description, as it helps with dry skin quite a bit, and didn't irritate even sensitive skin. After a week of use I didn't experience any breakouts, which some products do.Since there's no SPF, I don't suggest to use this as a day cream. Additionally, it takes awhile to sink in, so not ideal for most people's morning routines.Overall a nice night cream, but I find this to be way too expensive for an Olay product; most people that are loyal to Olay do not have the budget to purchase this product. Keeping it closer to the $10 mark would help more people with sensitivities who are on a tight income.",

I love it. Often times, when you remove so many ingredients, the product ends up not working very well, but this is not the case here.The 2nd thing that I love is the fact that this cream feels like a cloud. It is so soft on applilcation and you only need a little bit. My skin has started absorbing this cream and my dry patches are slowly going away.",
