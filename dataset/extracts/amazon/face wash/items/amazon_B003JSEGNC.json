                "reviewText": "I never heard of this brand or product before until I saw a manufacturer's coupon in the paper for their Effaclar Duo Acne cream product. Right away, I start to google info about the brand/products. As always, I also go to Amazon.com to read everyone's reviews about any products. The reviews were promising and thought I would give the cleanser a try. I used Obagi Nu Derm product line for almost 3 years. In the past year, I have had many hormonal monthly breakouts every single month. I started to trying other products that would clean my oily skin better and prevent big acne cystic breakouts. I've tried other products like Peter Thomas Roth, and Cetaphil oily skin cleanser (that didn't break any oils off my skin), and over the counter products, but they left my skin too dry and I still had blemishes and acne, the kind that are big red and bumpy first like a mosquito bite, then it finally breaks through with the pus. ( I know, it's digesting)So far, I have used this foaming cleanser all week. The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, free of the day's mineral makeup products and removes the oily, shiny skin I have very refreshed and cleansed. My face felt clean, soft and not tight. I am in my upper 40s and I don't want products that make my skin feel too dry or tight. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling soothed, clean and fresh.I am also ordering their Effaclar MToner to complement the cleanser and I will slowly build up the Effaclar line into my skin routine, including the eye cream. For someone who has had those cystic, hormonal big red bump pimples, I hope this will be my answer to finally get things under control. My dermatologist gave me Retin A Micro to put on my giant pimples. All the Retin A did was dry it up a bit, flake my skin along the surrounding area and then as the pimple dries up, it makes it super dark and leaving me with this very dark pigmented scar. So, I quit using the Retin A too. I bought the Effaclar Duo acne treatment because it has peroxide which I hope will lighten up the pimple and its scars.I'll have to update this review after a month or two of using the La Roche-Posay products. But so far, I like the way my skin looks and feel.Update: Feb. 13, 2013:I returned this product as it was overly drying to my oily skin. It was very effective at drying the oily skin; actually too much for me. Perhaps for a teenager with extreme oily and acne skin types.",

I\u2019m not sure how to describe it.. like weirdly chemical.

I wet face, pour some into my hand, foam it up, and rub on my face before rinsing.I have combination skin time (not totally oily and not totally dry). After using this, my face was noticeably less oily and also felt nice and soft. However, if I used this alone, I would have a tight/dry feeling to my face afterwards.My skin routine is to pat the skin dry after using this cleanser and then I apply my other products. I think having a moisturizer is the only essential one to avoid that dry/tight feeling. Personally, before the moisturizer I like to use a Vitamin C serum. In the morning I apply a sunscreen at the end after the moisturizer.",
