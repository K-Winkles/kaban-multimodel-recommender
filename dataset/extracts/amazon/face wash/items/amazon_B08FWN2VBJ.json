Gel cleansers tend to be drying even if they promise otherwise.This stuff is different. It feels like washing your face with aloe gel. Its so gentle I can scrub it onto my eyes and all of my reactive skin with no issues, but still feels cleansing and moisturizing. Its got a lovely soft light scent and while expensive, the bottle is a good size. I think it\u2019s the only facial cleanser I will actually rebuy in the past 10 years or so of experimenting with skincare.Of note: SHAKE THE TUBE BEFORE YOU SQUEEZE OUT PRODUCT, as it tends to separate and get liquidy if you don\u2019t, and way more comes out than you need. I just shake the tube a bit before I squeeze to emulsify it again and it\u2019s great.",

It\u2019s a gel so you only need a tiny amount to cover your whole face and neck area.Love it.Love how it leaves my skin feeling silky soft after I apply it. It\u2019s not oily and it doesn\u2019t feel sticky!!And I can honestly say that I see a difference in my skin complexion.Definitely recommend!

                "reviewText": "After being loyal to one brand for 50 years, I changed facial cleansers to Hanalei Aloe E Hawaiian! Hanalei is light weight, with a faint, pleasant floral-fresh smell. I only need a tiny amount of this transparent, green liquid to produce enough lather for my entire face and neck, and by tiny, I mean less than the size of a pea! My face feels clean and smooth, but not tight.At $24 for ________, using such a scant amount twice daily, I imagine the tube will last quite awhile.I initially discovered this product as a paid for sample through IPSY.",

I dab a little bit on my face and neck in the evening and my skin stays moisturized throughout the night. It is so lightweight on your skin and true to advertisement it is not greasy at all.My skin feels hydrated and looks beautiful and healthy after just a few days of use.Don\u2019t think twice, just buy it you will not regret it!",

Could t wait to get the full-size bottle.This is great for eye makeup remover. With warm water, this and a soft washcloth, eye makeup comes off easy. There are times where I have to put a little more on, gently massage in on, and it all comes off-especially with a swoop/cat eye line.There isn\u2019t tugging or pulling needed. It gently cleanses and works better than expected.",
