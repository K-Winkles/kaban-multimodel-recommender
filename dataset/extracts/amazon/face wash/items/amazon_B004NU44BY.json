                "reviewText": "Neutrogena's Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Facial Scrub with Glycerin has become an essential part of my skincare routine, and for good reason.First and foremost, this scrub delivers on its promise of invigoration. The refreshing, tingling sensation as it foams up on your skin is a wake-up call for your face. It's like a spa treatment right in your own bathroom.The glycerin in the formula ensures that while it exfoliates, it also moisturizes, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not tight or dry like some other scrubs. I have combination skin, and this scrub strikes the perfect balance for me.The exfoliating beads are gentle yet effective, helping to remove dead skin cells and leaving my complexion visibly brighter. I've noticed a significant reduction in blackheads and a smoother texture since incorporating this product into my routine.What's also great is that a little goes a long way. Just a small amount creates a rich lather, so a single tube lasts quite a while, making it a budget-friendly choice for skincare enthusiasts.Overall, Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Facial Scrub with Glycerin is a must-have for anyone seeking a revitalizing and effective facial scrub. It has become my go-to, and I can't recommend it enough for achieving a refreshed and glowing complexion.",
