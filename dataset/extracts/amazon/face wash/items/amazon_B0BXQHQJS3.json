I was weary about ordering this face wash because of how cheap it is. But I tried this one out and it is so gentle on my skin. The smell of it was a little strong but it has kept my skin clear and does the job of cleaning it I also would make sure to put on a moisture after you use the face wash because it can leave you face a little dry. Other than that I would definitely recommend this one if you are trying to save some money in skin care!",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this cleanser works amazing at getting off all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara, and making my face feel nice and clean.Second, It does have alcohol in it so it does dry out your skin, but a moisturizer will help combat that. It will also really hurt if you have a cut or get it in your eyes (obviously).Third, I honestly hate the smell, but it works better than most cleansers I've tried so in my opinion it's worth it. Maybe if you already know you like the smell of the willow bark extract you'll love it, but never having smelled it before I can say now that I do not. It's very similar to tea tree oil so it's extremely strong and even hurts my nose to inhale before rinsing it off.",
