                "reviewText": "Lately my skin has just become riddled with pimples. Some whiteheads but for the most part, painful cysts, below the skin, that would last for weeks on end. It was as if I was going through a second round of puberty, but worse. My skin had gotten to be worse then it had ever been in my entire life. I tried many different washes: Neutrogena, Clinique, etc. Nothing seemed to make a difference that made me feel like things were improving in the way I wanted. I happened to come across this skincare line and read good reviews, so I figured I had nothing to lose and decided to try it.I went to their website to determine which of their products would be best for me. I have combo skin type; dry in some places, but greasy in the T zone. When first using the product, I noticed the smell. It is a bit strong, but at the same time, very clean and fresh smelling. It has a thin gel consistency, and doesn't foam up much. After rinsing it off, my skin felt rejuvenated. It did not feel tight in the dry places, and my greasy areas felt nice and cleansed. I have been using this for about a week, and I already feel so much better about my where my skin is at. I only have a few small, barely noticeable pimples, that are more on the surface, rather than the deep, cystic ones. I use the wash twice a day, morning and night.I am very happy with my purchase, and am excited to continue to use this wash to hopefully see continued results. I would definitely recommend trying out this cleanser to anyone looking for a solution to their acne.",

I was using it as my main cleanser and didn't clean my face at all, it clogged my pores, specially if you are prone to acne and want a cleanser than at the end of the day can deep clean your face full of make up. Now, here is the good part of this product, good ingredients and a gentle way to apply salicylic acid to your face prone to acne. After I clean my face ( with another cleanser) I apply Mario Badescu Acne Facial and leave it for 2 minutes, the smell is pleasant and my face feel refresh and ready for a toner. This product is similar than \"Yes To Tomatoes Acne Daily Repair Treatment\", but Mario Badescu is more gentle.",

                "reviewText": "This facial cleanser is my favorite one that I have found. It works well for acne skin. This cleanser for acne skin will prevent and heal acne, not irritate acne and be gentle to skin while cleansing the face. Therefore, I highly recommend this facial cleanser for those who are struggling with their skin conditions and want to make themselves more confident.Effect and FeelingOne of the amazing results of this cleanser is that you can see slight results just after a week of using this product. Since this facial cleanser is formulated with acne-fighting salicylic acid, your acne and pimples will effectively be relieved and reduced if you stick to using it. Although the salicylic acid is irritating, you will not have any strong feeling. The feeling of this product is very gentle even if you have some inflamed acne. Also, it will leave skin refreshing, comfortable and smoother instead of dry and tight. You will love to apply this cleanser every morning and night because you will be happy to find your skin condition gets noticeably better. The bottle mouth is the only thing that can be improved since I need to pull out the tube, squeeze and push the tube back every time I use it. A handy pump is preferable. However, this little problem cannot prevent me from loving this product.Smell and PriceAnother aspect that I like is the smell of this facial cleanser. Since it contains aloe vera and chamomile, you can smell a faint scent when you are washing your face. The scent is very gentle so that those who do not like strong scent do not have to worry about it. Besides, the price of this product, which costs $15 with a capacity of 6 ounces, is reasonable because the dosage is small. You only need to squeeze out a small amount of liquid since it spreads pretty easily. Taking both the effect and dosage into consideration, this facial cleanser is worth the money. For those who decide to take a long-term use, the frequency to purchase the item will be 1 unit every 4 to 5 months at moderate dosage.Join me in becoming the lovers of this facial cleanser! It surely will be your favorite cleanser because it helps so much in preventing and healing acne. Everyone deserves a better skin. Give yourself a chance to try this product and you won\u2019t regret!",

                "reviewText": "This was the final piece of the puzzle in an 18 year battle with severe-moderate acne. I have very sensitive type 2 skin and can only use BP2.5% every 3 nights or so without coming out in blotches and peeling. Was using \"Simple refreshing facial wash\" as that was the best cleanser I had tried before this (I can't use most specialised \"acne\" cleansers as they are much too harsh - even the acne.org cleanser and moisturizer irritate my face) but was still getting spots which would occasionally spiral out of control and need more extreme BP treatment which would blotchify my face beyond recognition. I've been on 2 courses of Accutane and many courses of antibiotics but spots would always come back.To cut a long story short this product is 100% staying in my regime forever or as long as they keep making it. At first I was worried it would be too drying but using the acne.org 10 second rule it's fine and doesn't lead to drying/overcompensating of oil production. It probably wouldn't have cured the acne on its own (no cleanser would have) but it's the best cleanser I've ever used in the whole long will-sapping ordeal. For the first time in 18 years I have zero spots and calm even complexion (I'm not too bothered about scars as long as the redness is gone and complexion is even). It's not all because of this cleanser but it has contributed as much as a cleanser can.If it will help anyone else in this situation this is the regime which works for me:- This cleanser in the morning (using the Acne.org 10 second rule - don't leave it on your face for more than 10 seconds).- small amount of \"Simple Spotless Skin Anti-Blemish Moisturiser\" or \"Retinol Cream for Day & Night by Poppy Austin\" on alternate days (the retinol helps to exfoliate - you need to exfoliate somehow but I've had bad luck with exfoliating scrubs so find the retinol cream works much more gently - but still better to use only every other day to keep skin calm).- \"Clarins 1 Step Facial Clean Orange Extract\" with a cotton pad at night and one other time in the day if there is any excess sweat or oil (lightly with the cotton pad).- \"Acne.org BP 2.5%\" after the Clarins approx. every 2-3 days for maintenance if I feel it needs it. Leave on overnight. Never use in sunlight. If controlling active acne (not just maintenance) I would use this every night and put up with the blotchiness. I've had bad luck applying moisturizer over BP so stopped using moisturizer at night (just drink lots of water, 4 pints per day really helps with overall skin tone and also keeping pores clear).- the pink \"Mario Badescu - Drying Lotion\" for spot treatment anytime but mostly overnight (I haven't needed this for a few months now since using the cleanser so fingers crossed).Speaking from long experience and experimentation this is the best cleanser I've used hands down. Very much recommended as part of an acne regime.",

I use it after I have removed my make up with micellar water with my washable bamboo pads. I use the pads with this cleanser also and it works well. I then rinse with tepid water and apply my moisturizer. My skins feels super soft after use. I do feel this is helping to sweep away dead skin cells from the surface assisting in reducing breakouts. It has a gel like consistency, feels very cooling and comfortable when wiped across the skin. I have had no skin irritation, tightness, redness or itchiness which is a sign my skin does not I will be back to buy more when I get low.",
