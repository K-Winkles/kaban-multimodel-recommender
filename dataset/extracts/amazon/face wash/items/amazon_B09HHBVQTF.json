I'm used to psoriasis everywhere, but the injections I'm on (which cleared up the psoriasis) but has caused a lot of acne breakouts. I alternate this wash with 1 of 2 of my regular face washes (elf minty foaming cleanser or the boscia charcoal cleanser) and it's hasn't worsened the acne and it hasn't irritated the psoriasis still present on my face. This product is super drying tho, so def go in with a good moisturizer and don't over use this. Best bet is talking it over with a derm tho. And as always w most acne products, many increase sun sensitivity so like sun protection lol if you wanna use this",

I can\u2019t tell any difference and this wash cleared my skin right back up. My face did get SLIGHTLY more dry than the norm (nothing huge), so I\u2019d suggest keeping that in mind with moisturizer. The texture is super soft and smooth on the skin. Other than that I am super happy with this purchase and will definitely continue to purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Really wanted to love this but it didn\u2019t foam at all. I was wearing a lot of makeup so I used a removing cloth first and this product STILL did NOT remove my foundation! I was shocked! I used a LOT of product too! Also, the menthol smell was strong and unnecessary? Why? I do not have sensitive skin, but it left my face a little swollen, red in places and blotchy after use. Finally, after rinsing thoroughly, it felt like a slick layer of product was still left on my face. Yuck. I was visiting my family across the country, so threw it away- other, I\u2019d have returned it immediately.",
