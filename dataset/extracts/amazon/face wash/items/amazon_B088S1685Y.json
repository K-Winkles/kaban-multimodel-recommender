                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Soft and Supple!",
                "reviewText": "This product seems unscented to me, which I LOVE, as I\u2019m very sensitive to fragrances. I admit that I also really LOVE the bottle and labeling. That shouldn\u2019t matter, but I guess it does.I really like that you can use it without water and you can just wipe it off with tissue instead of having to rinse your face. That\u2019s more convenient when traveling or really tired.The first time I used it, it did seem to be a bit trying to my skin. However, I\u2019ve been using this now for several weeks, and it no longer feels drying at all. It definitely exfoliates my skin.Before I used this, my skin felt rough to my touch. My partner never mentioned anything, but it made me feel old! Plus, I wondered how well my other few skin products, like sunscreen, were getting absorbed into my rough, scaly skin.Originally, when I switched from using just regular soap to using this, later in the day, I would be a little oily in certain places on my face. Maybe the T-zone. I\u2019m not sure, because after a few weeks of using this, that has gone away.My skin now feels balanced and soft, not rough or scaly anymore. In fact, I like to use this on other parts of my body, such as where I shave, to try to prevent ingrown hairs. I\u2019m not sure how effective it is for that, though. I think I need something stronger for that.I\u2019m 52, and I guess I have to face the fact that I\u2019m in menopause, and that has changed my skin. I\u2019m no longer oily, so that\u2019s a huge plus of getting older, ha ha! But it\u2019s been confusing for me to figure this out!Since I was 14 and for about 30 years afterward, I have had varying degrees of oily, acne-prone skin ranging from severe (I took Accutane for two rounds in high school) to eventually getting less and less oily over the years.My point is that I still tend to think of myself as having oily skin, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true anymore, due to menopause. I rarely get whitehead pimples anymore, but I do still have some blackheads and some large pores on and near my nose and some scattered blackheads in other areas of my face.I didn\u2019t wear sunscreen from age 20-50, so I have sun-damaged skin on my face and especially on my neck. (Now, I wish I had put up with the oiliness of the sunscreens of those days!) So, I don\u2019t really know which skin products are best for me.Given that, plus realizing that no at-home product is going to fix 30 years of sun damage, I didn\u2019t know which cleanser to choose. I\u2019ve been trying to find a good one for a few years, but I feel I can never quite reach Nirvana with anything, especially since I\u2019m unwilling to do more than 1-2 steps in the morning and 0-1 at night!I used this for the first time on my face without any water for cleansing. I rinsed it off using water, though. It felt really good going on, using it, and rinsing it off. After gently wiping my face dry (not patting as I\u2019ve heard we\u2019re supposed to do; I\u2019m too lazy to take that kind of time!), I noticed pretty quickly that my face felt a little dry.I almost never use moisturizer, and the slight dryness this caused on my face did not make me go running for the moisturizer like some other cleaners have done. It was a little bit bothersome, but it must\u2019ve gone away fairly quickly because I never ended up using the moisturizing sunscreen that I bought to go with it.My only concern was wondering if using it means I need to be more careful in the sun. I\u2019ve been pretty good about wearing sunscreen lately, plus, it\u2019s been Winter; I haven\u2019t had too much sun exposure, so I am not sure whether this makes one more prone to sunburn, but I\u2019d imagine at least a little bit since it\u2019s exfoliating.Update: It\u2019s been about 7 hours since I used it for the first time, and my cheeks, nose, and sides of my forehead are somewhat oily now. I didn\u2019t expect that, and that is very disappointing.Updated update: As mentioned above, this oiliness went away with a few weeks of use. Now, my skin feels soft, supple, and, dare I say, dewey, but not oily! And the original amount of oiliness was not ever a big problem anyway.In fact, I\u2019ve now got this product on subscription, and I\u2019m going to try out other products in this line by Neutrogena.After using this product and liking it, I also ordered their blue bottle of exfoliating liquid, and I use that on the areas I shave to try to prevent ingrown hairs. It works **really well** to smooth my skin, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s preventing ingrown hairs yet. I guess I should use it on my face and neck, too ha ha!!Bottom line: if you don\u2019t have overly oily skin, and you want gentle exfoliation that doesn\u2019t make you super prone to sunburn and doesn\u2019t cause peeling, give this a try! If you\u2019re still too oily after using this fir a few weeks, return it and try the blue or green bottle.",

I also get dry patches from being chronically dehydrated, and this has HELPED SOLVE THAT TO SOME EXTENT, TOO. This product has a very light scent, for those of us with scentsitivities (eyyy!), and is suuuper milky and creamy and smooth. It sometimes feels like it hasn't washed completely off, but don't worry, it's just moisturizing you. To me, a li'l silicone scrubby is key, or else it kinda feels like it's just sitting on top, but honestly my face and neck have never been more clear than after starting to use this. For some reason, I can't reliably find it in shops, so Amazon it is. Def give it a go if you have dry, bumpy skin!",

That could have been my fault for not reading the description enough or Amazon's crappy search function (because my search was for comedogenic face wash. That aside, I also wasn't a fan of the smell or the fact my face didn't feel clean after using it. Made me feel greasy.",

                "reviewText": "I love this cleanser so much! It leaves my face feeling clean, but also smooth and nice. It moisturize my skin too, While cleaning it at the same time! I struggled with dry skin for a while. I began using this cleanser about a year ago. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go to another cleanser. It\u2019s good for sensitive skin and it\u2019s very moisturizing. It doesn\u2019t dry me out like all the other cleansers I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s got a nice texture to it and it makes my skin feel nice afterwards. It\u2019s great quality without breaking the bank!",

                "reviewText": "I have rosacea and my skin is all uneven and red. It makes me look older. I can\u2019t even cover it with makeup since I have extremely dry skin. Since I started using this which is about a month my skin is softer, more moisturized, also the red is fading. My skin tone is much more even and while shopping someone said to me that I have a beautiful face, my skin looked great and like peaches and cream! I couldn\u2019t believe it, I also couldn\u2019t believe it worked that fast!I prefer to use it on dry skin then wipe off with tissue paper and finally rinse with water. It rinses off easy to rinse and I don\u2019t know how good it\u2019s remove makeup since I don\u2019t wear. I\u2019ll only use a primer and eye makeup at the max but I love this stuff. First thing to ever work this good and I used to use Christian Dior before I hurt my back and can\u2019t afford. You\u2019ll only be hurting yourself if you don\u2019t dry it. This is now my #1 facial product!!!!",
