It's the perfect blend of a cleaner and foams for that perfect clean. I don't have wear foundation because it makes my skin look great, healthy and even. Best face wash out there, and it's cheaper on Amazon! I love it even more for that!",

It is very light, scentless, and effective which is good for those who are sensitive to certain types of cleansers. I use this cleanser as a part of my double-cleansing routine because it gets its job done by cleansing and removing dirt and oils from my face. It feels really nice on the face as there are no strong scents or particles in the cleanser.",

It\u2019s unscented, prevents break outs, and is inexpensive. Great quality and value. Would recommend for daily use and for people with sensitive skin",

I\"m happy to use CeraVe products which are dependable quality products that don't have to be second guessed. I don't feel I need to worry about them like I would worry about something made in China, for instance.My skin is oily and this facial cleanser helps greatly. It cleans thoroughly and the salicylic acid helps to exfoliate my skin. Along with Hyaluronic Acid which I believe is beneficial to helping reduce the ravages of aging skin, I think this is an overall excellent product. The larger size makes it very cost effective.",

                "reviewText": "To make the long story short, this is great for dry, sensitive skin, and it really helps clear acne!Full review:I've had acne since I was 10, and back in the summer of 2016, I was prescribed birth control and a few months of Retin-A cream. Retin-A cream can be really harsh, so I initially only used it for my body acne and not my face. Eventually I started using a tiny amount a few times a week to help my remaining facial acne as the birth control continued to clear it and to help smooth some wrinkles and maybe fade my acne scars. However, I was still using St. Ives apricot scrub with salicylic acid and some roc retinol cream a few nights a week also. Add in some time in the sun with no sunblock, and I ended up with a terribly burned face. This, along with the dryness from a Colorado fall/early winter made my skin extremely dry and painful. I couldn't even apply moisturizer without it burning. Needless to say, I had to stop using any face wash. The dryness also started to make my skin break out, and I couldn't treat it with anything. After desperately googling remedies for my dry skin and forming acne, I started using a mixture of tea tree, argan, jojoba, rose hip, and sometimes castor oil on my face along with frequent honey masks. This fixed my dry skin, which store bought moisturizers for extremely dry skin couldn't do, but I still had terrible acne, like the worst I've ever had in my life. I started using a bar of Cerave moisturizing soap because it was on clearance at walmart for like $1 and I'd heard of people using it for acne. This helped to make my face feel cleaner, but it didn't really help my acne. I knew I needed something that could exfoliate my skin, but there was no way I was going to use something as harsh as the St. Ives scrub again. I decided to try this because I did like the Cerave bar soap even though it didn't help my acne, and this has at least some salycilic acid for exfoliation. When I first used it, I didn't think it was really going to help my acne because the consistency is so smooth and it doesn't seem like it could really exfoliate. However, after 1-2 weeks, I started to notice my skin clearing up. Slowly but surely, this face wash helped to almost completely clear my skin. I had also started taking my birth control more regularly, added a probiotic supplement, and started using vitamin c on my face, so I can't say this is the only thing that helped my acne, but it certainly contributed a lot. I also eventually started using an electric face brush to help exfoliate, and I think that could've helped. I still get acne around my period, and because I'm a college senior, so I'm always super stressed, don't get enough sleep, and don't always eat right. Also, you can't tell from the pictures, but I have quite a few blackheads on my nose. The face wash has helped clear some of those and make them smaller, but I have yet to find a product that actually completely gets rid of them, and I've tried many. Even with the blackheads, my skin is so much better now. This face wash saved my skin, and I think it's worth every penny!Pictures:Picture 1- The right side is a picture from February 14, 2017 without any makeup after starting my oil treatment. The left side is from April 7, 2017 with makeup, but you can still see how awful my skin was. I didn't start using the face wash until around the end of April.Picture 2- The left part is from July 7, 2017, and the two on the right are both from July 17, 2017. I am wearing makeup in all of these pictures, but you can tell that my skin had improved significantly. Few pimples, but lots of acne scars from the breakout.Picture 3- Both were taken August 21, 2017 with make up. Once again you can see I don't have many pimples, just terrible acne scars.Picture 4- The left part was taken December 12, 2017. I was testing a BB cream, so it is cover the bottom half of my face, but you can see that my skin looks pretty clear. The top right side was taken December 13 with the BB cream on my entire face. The bottom right picture was taken today with no makeup. As I said previously, I still get pimples from stress and periods, but they are usually small and mild instead of the giant lumps I was getting before, and they go away really quickly using cosrx pimple patches (definitely check those out) and vitamin c serum. Also, please note that I do have freckles, so most of the spots on my face are just freckles or dark marks from old acne I am still trying to get rid of. Sorry for the long review, and all the pictures with makeup (I didn't take many without makeup when my skin was that bad), but I hope it helped!",
