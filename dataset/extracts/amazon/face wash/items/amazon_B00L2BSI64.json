This cleanser is particularly effective for my combination skin. The charcoal formula deeply cleanses, removing impurities and excess oil without over-drying my skin. I've noticed a significant reduction in blackheads and my pores appear much smaller. What I love most is the refreshing sensation it leaves after each wash, making my skin feel incredibly clean and rejuvenated. The cleanser lathers nicely and a little product goes a long way, which makes it economical. It's gentle enough for daily use and has become an indispensable part of my skincare regimen.

Though it does have a scent that I'm not sure how to describe, it is not perfumey or overwhelming.I have very sensitive, oily skin and this is a good cleanser that does not irritate my skin, though it used to. Ever since I started moisturizing everyday after a shower and after washing my face in the morning, my skin has been able to \"take the heat\" and not become irritated. If you are someone with dry skin, I wouldn't use it everyday because it can dry out the skin and leave a burning, tingly sensation - from my experience.I am happy with my purchase and I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Alright, folks, let's talk about the Bior\u00e9 Deep Pore Charcoal Face Wash, the superhero your oily skin's been waiting for!First off, this stuff means business. It's like a magnet for dirt and makeup, and it's so effective that even your stubborn mascara will be like, \"I surrender!\" The charcoal infusion is like a secret agent infiltrating your pores, leaving no trace of impurities behind. Mission accomplished!Now, if you're hoping to turn your face into a black hole (pun intended), you're in luck! This face wash goes on black, which is not only oddly satisfying but also makes you feel like you're giving your pores a deep, dark spa treatment. Plus, it rinses off cleanly, so no worries about walking around with a coal miner's face.But let's address the elephant in the room \u2013 charcoal can be a bit drying. So, if you have skin that's drier than the Sahara desert, you might want to use this sparingly or follow up with a good moisturizer. Dry skin is no joke, and we wouldn't want your face to feel like it's auditioning for a role in a horror movie.In conclusion, the Bior\u00e9 Deep Pore Charcoal Face Wash is like a dirt-busting magician for your face. It's black, it's powerful, and it leaves your skin feeling fresher than a daisy in a spring rainstorm. Just remember to keep the moisturizer handy if your skin leans towards the dry side. Cheers to clean, refreshed, and mysteriously dark pores! \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\uddfc\ud83d\ude0e",
