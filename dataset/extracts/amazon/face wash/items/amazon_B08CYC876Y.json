One of the waxes we use in our AM/PM moisturizers is made from beeswax, so our products aren\u2019t completely vegan. How do I incorporate Tiege Hanley into my shaving routine? We recommend using WASH first, then shaving. If it's a day that you are exfoliating, you would WASH, SCRUB and then shave. Moisturizer should be applied after you shave. If you use aftershave, you can use our AM moisturizer in its place. How should I apply Tiege Hanley if I have a beard? Full bearded guys should apply Tiege Hanley to the exposed areas of the face and neck only. Guys with stubble/light beards can apply our products through their facial hair on the entire face and neck. Why doesn't WASH create a lot of foam? Our WASH is designed to be gentle and contains very low concentrations of surfactants to keep skin hydrated after cleansing. Foaming in a cleanser only means there are lots of surfactants and does not equate to cleaning the skin.\"",

                "reviewText": "I've generally considered my skin to be fine, but I have the occasional dry skin and now some subtle wrinkles. I've generally avoided face cleaners and moisturizers because I never know what to buy, and when I have tried them, there is often a fragrance that makes my nose stuffy. A friend recommended I try Tiege Hanley so I bought the face wash. I also bought the AM moisturizer, PM moisturizer, and exfoliating scrub. The shipping estimate was something like a week or two, but the products arrived just two days after I ordered them. The products also came with simple to follow instructions. No confusion here. I know exactly what I need to do. Takes me a minute in the morning and a minute at night. I only use a small amount of the face wash in the morning and at night. It's got a very refreshing feeling and it's not drying my skin. Fragrance is kept to a minimum as well. Just a good clean wash you can't get with soap or some other products. I apply a dab of the moisturizer after the face wash and I'm done. I'm very happy with the product. I never thought I would have a skin care routine, let alone as simple as this. Finally I have something that works. Thanks Tiege for putting together a great product and making it easy.",

I feel so strongly, when I forgot my toiletries bag on a recent trip out of state, before the plane had even taken off I had already ordered the wash to be sent to where I was going! Then gifted the rest to my friend lol if you\u2019re looking for a great wash, or are getting into skin care, this is the perfect wash to start and end with!
