                "reviewText": "I love the product but HATE the product delivery system. Because the cleanser is so 'liquidy' too much comes out of the large opening. If it were in a pump delivery system or the hole were a bit smaller, it would be great. However, for the price, it's wasteful when you can't really see in the shower how much is coming out. Aloderma needs to fix this for it to be a TOTAL Five Stars. Other than that, I love the product. My personal recommendation would be adding it into a small personal pump bottle.",

I was on a sample club mailing, where I got several tiny face washes that I could tell were made with aloe, and I liked them. I googled best face washes made with aloe and this one was there. Feels great; makes my face feel great and removes makeup well. Less expensive that Lancome. Great product!",
