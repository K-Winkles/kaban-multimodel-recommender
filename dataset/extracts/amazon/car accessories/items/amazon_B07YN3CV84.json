Fabric is thick and super tough, we drove from Houston TX all the way to Portland OR, over 24 hours on the rough with a wide range of strong cross winds, dust tunnels, rain, sleet, snow, and it held up like a champ! The straps do look a bit flimsy but pretty strong though! I do recommend giving it one twisty before tightening down to avoid the loud vibrating whistling it makes.Con: The place the strap has to hold onto, in the door, will leak water when it rains but if you do a twist and tuck some paper towels under the strap it should help stop that.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research on the many different roof top bags available on Amazon, and settled on this one for its good reviews and fair price. I was uncertain at first if this bag would technically work with our car, as some product reviews and even direct answers from the seller in the Customer Questions indicate that it would not work with an Odyssey with no roof rack. To make sure though, I called the company directly, and the person I talked to at Rightline assured me the bag would work fine for our car. I also found a youtube video of an owner of a Honda Odyssey just like ours who bought and used this bag with good success. After seeing that video, I decided to buy it. We used it last week for a 1,000 mile round trip beach vacation - we needed extra space because we were dropping my son off at college on the way back. The bag itself is very thick, tough material. The zippers are a little tough to work at first, but I was fine with it with the understanding that probably made them more weatherproof. We did not use any kind of pad underneath, and honestly, I don't know why you would need one, as the bag secures very well to the roof after tightening the straps and the underside of it is not abrasive. On our way down, we drove through 5+ hours of heavy rain, and everything inside the bag was bone dry when we arrived at our destination. However, because we dont have a roof rack, we had to attach the bag through the doors (note, this works fine even with sliding doors...). This shouldn't be a problem in dry weather, other than a little extra wind noise. However, the straps and buckles create small gaps in the doors, and water steadily dripped inside our car at all 4 attachment points. It was not pouring in, but with 5 hours of rain, a steady drip adds up and is quite annoying, with seats, floors, and doors getting constantly wet. That's my only complaint...Other than the rain issue, I think the bag is very high quality, secures well to the roof of your car, keeps your stuff dry, and will last a long time.",

Everything worked great and we went through several spots of heavy rain. It did not leak and seemed to hold up well. After our vacation we loaded up for our trip home. All was good. However, upon arriving at home and taking out our luggage the material did not hold up well at all (see the picture). The carrier was fully secured, did not move during the trip and was not rubbing on anything. It was about 75% filled so it was not over stuffed. It also was not so empty that it flapped in the wind. Not really sure why it ripped and wore so bad, but it did not hold up well at all. And of course it has a short window for returns, so I'm stuck with it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these.. Let me just say, they went above and beyond expectations. I drove nearly 3k miles from west coast to east coast. Through a lot of rain and even hail. Everything stayed dry. We also came across a lot of wind. Things stayed intact however there was some push on my 2011 Hyundai Sanata. Nothing too bad just had to change lanes a little more carefully. I did check the straps each time I stopped. The sounds from the wind hitting the stars was a little loud until the straps loosened a bit. However the way we knotted the straps they did not loosen too much to worry above slippage or loss of our belongings. I would highly recommend. Even with the weight of our belongings there was no signs of denting in the top of my car! Big plus!",

Well worth the money. It didn't rain on this trip but I expect everything to stay dry in there. I'll update if it doesn't lol",

We had problems keeping it secure, it was VERY noisy on the interstate. It moved and pushed up with the wind, and we were pulled over on the side of the interstate trying to secure it. We had to tighten it every stop and even make special stops to tighten it. My husband and son do know what they are doing in this area so I don't know that it was fully user error, maybe this is just what is expected with this type of product. We also did not like the zipper, it was very difficult to maneuver and operate. Overall, we decided this is not a good product for us.",
