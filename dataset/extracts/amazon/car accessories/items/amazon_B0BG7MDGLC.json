I think the quality is great considering the price is pretty low. The only negative to keep in mind before buying is that it runs a little bit smaller than the measurements listed by the seller as other reviews have said.",

Prior to buying it, I posted the question whether this would work for a Mercedes Benz and I received positive responses so, I went ahead and bought it. Not meant to be because this cover did not fit mine - that's why I rated it a 3 star. This is not one of those universal accessories - not a one size fits all.I would have kept it as the color and quality were big pluses for me if only it fits.",
