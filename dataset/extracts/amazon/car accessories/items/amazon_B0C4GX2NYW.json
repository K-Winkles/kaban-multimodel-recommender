                "reviewText": "I love that these fit perfectly in the cup holder in my car doors so I don\u2019t take up space in the regular cup holders. It\u2019s just me so I don\u2019t have much trash to throw away, but if I do happen to have passengers, they don\u2019t need to worry about reaching into my backseat for the bin I have for bigger trash. They can throw small wrappers away right by their feet. The only con I have is I wish you could buy the specific bags the holders come with separately instead of a similar one that maybe or may not be the same size. Assembly is self explanatory and the hinge seems pretty reliable as long as you\u2019re not too aggressive with filling it up too much. Very much worth the price as well!",

                "reviewText": "I saw this item in every youtuber/tiktok video so I decided to give it a shot. The item is cute and the black color seems pretty solid. The container has an opening for the trash and the top half comes off. The item comes with a roll of bags (smaller than your usual doggie bag) that fits the container but is a hassle to fit it and place the cover back on. After trying a few times, I ditched the bag. Item holds a good portion size, but definitely for the gum wrapper/straw wrapper/random trash size items. Fits nicely in the panel portion of the door.",

                "reviewText": "Just got our first minivan and these trash cans are a total must-have. We didn't want anything to be in the walkways so I purchased these.- We have two different-sized cupholders and these were able to fit in both the big and small with no problem.- They came with clearish white bags, but you can also use dog bags as an insert- Haven't had any issues with the lid popping off, it fits snug- We keep one in the front and one in the back where the kids are. They can easily put wrappers in there.- They don't carry a ton of garbage, but just enough. Great for gum and wrappers. I am ok with that because I didn't want anything too big.- I would 100% get this as a gift to someone who owns a minivan",
