Note : The 3M Gasket just can be used once, please think twice to stick it.The holder and 3M Gasket work best on flat dashboards or glass surfaces and cannot be used on rugged surfaces.If the base does not stick to your car, you can use the 3M Gasket that we give away to solve the concerns.",

There is an expandable arm that allows you to pull the phone out to about 8\", or you can leave it back to about 4\". The included a 3M adhesive plate if you want to use the suction cup on a rough surface. It's a 2-thumbs up from me!",

                "reviewText": "Comparing this to other similarly priced phone holders, I'm pretty satisfied. I bought one for myself, and I had no issues installing it to my car. Works great. However, sometimes I would return to my car after leaving it out it the summer sunlight and find that arm detached from the base, so I would have to re-suction it back on. Maybe it had to do with the heat? I'm not entirely sure, but ever since I started to put windshield sun shades up, it never randomly detached again.It's very adjustable and easy to manage. I actually bought another one for my dad. For his car, the base mount for the holder wouldn't attach to the dashboard to that car as well as mine. It kept slipping, so we eventually mounted the arm to the windshield instead of the dashboard, without the separate base plate. It hasn't been long since the installation, but so far it's working well. I have no clue if the heat will affect this type of installation because it is now fall, but if either products start failing on me or my dad, I will update this review.Overall, I like how it does have many ways to mount in case one way doesn't work for you. The mechanism for the phone grip is kinda cool. And it's better built than the cheap AC vent car phone holder I had before it (that thing lasted 2 weeks tops before it started to have cracks in the plastic causing it to slip off when you drive). Definitely worth it in the $8-$13 price range.Edit: The second one I bought, I attached it to the windshield. The adhesive lasted fine until summer rolled around. After letting it sit in the car in 100+ degree weather, the adhesive eventually gave up leaving me with no other choice than to use the car ac vent mount that came with it. I have another one but it's attached to the car's dashboard and is still fine, especially because I make sure to put up a windshield sunshade whenever I'm not using the car. So if you are planning to attach it to your windshield and you live in a hot climate, I would recommend looking for an alternative.",

I let it cure for a day, but unfortunately the gasket wouldn't stay attached, effectively ruining the 1 time use adhesive. The suction cup alone works great though. I've tried it on the same dash and moved to onto my windshield to avoid my phone heating up as badly when the vents were running. I swapped away from the vent clip on because its winter, heat would cause my phone to over-heat and it refused to charge. Suction cup is super strong. Go off roading with terrible suspension and its holding still like a champ. The mount has room to run wires through it too, which is nice for keeping things organized looking and avoiding obstructing your view. The telescoping arm and adjustable and rotateable design is neat too, I can lay back and watch a movie or two on it while relaxing. Definitely a keeper!",
