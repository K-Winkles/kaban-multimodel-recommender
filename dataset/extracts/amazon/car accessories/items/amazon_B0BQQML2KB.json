These help organize extra items I have lying around and my friends sitting in the back can keep their phones in the pockets while connected to the AUX. Good for camping and organizing little things. I can fill them with hand sanitizer mini bottles, wipes, tissues, the possibilities are endless. I have both on my front car seats and they fit my 2005 Toyota matrix perfectly. I would say they are not perfectly straight on the chairs due to their incline and the bottom loop is attached in a wonky way to the bottom of the chair. It works, though!",

I thought they would work well to allow my teen to have a place to put her things within reach for long road trips. They were entirely too long to fit on the front seat or the captain chairs in the center row. This was a shame as I was truly looking forward to a place to keep things, like the remote / head phones for the rear entertainment center.",

I only put one on because really all they hold are small cords for me. Anything else that fits flips out of it so no idea what people might use these for.Another issue I have noticed is that they spin aroundTo the front so the person getting into the seat needs to move it back or rest their back on it. I supposeI could shorten the to fix that issue but I really doubt I will use it that long.",
