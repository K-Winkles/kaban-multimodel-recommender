I love the product the only thing about it was the life of it. They amazingly sent me a new one and it works great and is amazing! The person who was talking with me was amazing and so kind. I got the replacement super fast. I believe I just got a bad one out of the batch the first time. The one I now have is amazing and I thank the company for their great costumer service! Thank you!",

However after a month, this won't hold a charge (even after I followed the specific charging instructions) nor will it run with any sort of power or suction for more than a minute. I would return it if I could, as it's already broken.",

I don\u2019t have pets, so can\u2019t comment on pet hair, but it took up small stones, dirt and pine needles from the floor mats in my car. I was able to vac the entire car with one charge\u2026may be able to use it a second time also on that same charge. It\u2019s not the most powerful portable car vac, but does the job. Easy to clean the filter\u2026though note the little brush they show for cleaning is not included. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is not a really strong suction.",

I gave it 3 chances with the battery fully charged and I got the same \"funny\" result.Conclusion: it is a very nice TOY for kids not an efficient vaccum solution.",
