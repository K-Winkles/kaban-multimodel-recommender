                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this mirror. It's perfect for touching up my makeup when I go out. But if you have sensitive skin or care about your skin at all, cover the mirror when your visor is down to block the sun when you're driving during the day.I always keep my visor down when driving during the day, well two months into having this mirror I started noticing a dark spot appear on my forehead between my eyes. I work remotely so I'm not out in the sun very often so I was very concerned about this irregular shaped dark spot on my forehead. I tried covering it with makeup but makeup would not stick to that part of my skin and as time went on that area became really dry and wrinkly looking. I was so confused because I'm in my early 30's and thankfully I don't have any wrinkles and I use a lot of anti-aging products. I went to the dermotogist to make sure it was indeed a sunspot and not something else. I began treating the sunspot with various skin care treatments, I wore 70spf sunscreen and stayed in the house for two wks after a facial peel. The sunspot drastically lightened and became less visible. One day I removed the mirror to charge it and I didn't put in back on my visor because I forgot. I drove around for a month without it and my sunspot did not get bigger and did not darken. Well eventually I put the mirror back on my visor and after a few times driving with it down during the day I noticed the sunspot was darkening again. Then it hit me the mirror was reflecting the sun onto my forehead causing skin damage. The sunspot appeared around the time I got the mirror. So I began treating the sunspot all over again and now I remove it when I'm driving during the day and the sun spot on my forehead has not darkened.Please beware....When UV rays hit a mirror, the mirror reflects most of the UVA light. This light then hits your skin, generating a cascade of free radicals that leads to wrinkles and dark spots. Remove the mirror to put a piece of cloth over it when driving with your visor down!!!!",
