I have a midsized SUV.The clip idea is good. But I couldn\u2019t find a good spot to hang them. Fortunately, I have a small tray space in the center console that fits the container perfectly! And I have a small stowaway space at the bottom of the center console facing my 2nd row seats. I will have to use some removal poster putty to keep it from sliding out on a hard stop.The little bags are similar sized to doggy poo bags. But not as long. They are much thinner and can tear easily. But it does the job.My car is dark brown with black interior. So the brown trimmed trash bins are a good match. I\u2019m glad I got them. Perfectly sized. And easy to empty when refueling.",

It's leakproof, so no need to worry about any mess.I mean, who knew a trash can could be this exciting, right? It's like the Marie Kondo of car accessories - it sparks joy and keeps things organized. Plus, the fact that I can hang it wherever I want is just the cherry on top.",

It comes with bags so it should stay clean and is easily emptied. I have only had it a week or 2, so far it seems sturdy but I can't speak to the longevity. It is small so it would not fit a whole lot, a soda can or fast food wrappers would not fit but it serves the purpose for me.",

I like the little trash bags it gives you as you don't have to dump the whole bin out whenever it gets full. My only issue with this is that sometimes it slides if you apply it at the bottom of the drivers car door. And in my car at least, if it slides too much to the left then my car door won't close all the way as the trash bin is in the way but if it's kept all the way to the right then I'm able to close my door all the way. This issue doesn't happen too often so it's not too much of a bother for me. Overall, I would recommend! Helps keep my car clean of trash and is mostly hidden away.",

I had seen so many people say it didn't fit their car...so I'm thinking they just guessed, rather than actually measuring. My car is a 2022 Chevy Equinox, and this little baby fits perfectly inside the door panel! It is small, but you can't expect something big to fit in a small space. I love that it comes with some garbage bags that fit it, as I often need to discard my tea bags in the car, so the bags hold in any leftover water from them, without messing up the inside of the bin. Measure first, and you will get this one right!",
