Once it's on, it feels like it's going to stay. The sparkles seem to be holding up well after a few weeks and I like that this is soft and simple yet stylish. My only complaint is that on the second day, some of the stitching started pulling. If I pull the thread, it will remove several stitches. I've been doing my best to cut them or burn them off with a lighter. The material seems sturdy but the stitching around the elastic just isn't.",
