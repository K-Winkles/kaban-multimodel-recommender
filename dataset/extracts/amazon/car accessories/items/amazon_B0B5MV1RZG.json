The little black box past the initial power cable makes a ear screeching high pitch noise4. The solder points on the wire to any components (black box, USB connector,ect.) are poorly done.Overall 0/10 save your money.",

I would assume cutting it down to length with instantly make it brighter as its only running off of 5v and the shorter it is the brighter it will be.",

My model car (2005 Mercedes E55) could be more difficult with older designed dashboard than your car though? Good value compared to some higher priced light strips. Unfortunately I will be removing and sending it back, not sure if the light strip I got was mislabeled or this is the Company's perception of \"ICE-BLUE\" but it's much to green in color for my liking... I would call it seafoam green! But, I will reorder from this company and just get regular blue.",
