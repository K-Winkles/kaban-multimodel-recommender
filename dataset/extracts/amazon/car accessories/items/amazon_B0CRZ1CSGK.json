                "reviewText": "If you've ever knelt beside your car during a rainstorm trying to retrieve your car keys because they fell between your seat and the center console, you know exactly why this product exists. It takes less than a minute to install and completely covers the gap that serves as a black hole for keys, phones, and countless coins - and it is such a win once you've got one, you won't do without it.Installation takes about 30 seconds per side - the package includes 2 to protect both front seats. The product is designed with a hook-shaped opening at the back that goes around your seatbelt clasp, and the rest of it fills the empty space between the seat and console with a semi-flexible surface that blocks anything from sliding down and under your seat. A half-inch wide indention in the top of the plug provides an easy place to put your phone, coins, or pens that you want to have quick access to. Unlike some other similar products which look like long beanbags, this one is smooth and flexible enough to fill up the space, but the hook around your seatbelt clasp will keep it from being accidentally pushed down into the space beside the seat.You won't want this one if your center console is lower than your seat, as it won't be stable. I was originally concerned that the hook would make clicking the seatbelt into the clasp, but the reality is the hook holds the clasp in the same place - so you don't have to try to figure out where it is. The plug is waterproof, easy to clean, and dark enough to vanish in the dark beside the seat.I can't imagine NOT having one of these in every car I own and have already ordered a second set for my SUV. Just to effort it will save in vacuuming at the carwash will justify its very reasonable cost.",

It was really frustrating in the past to have to get out of the car to search under the seat for things that fall through the gap between the seat and the middle console. I love how flexible plastic material that has a notch to allow for the seat belt latch to be exposed. It also does fine when I move the seat forward or backward. I have a Prius V and it fit perfectly. I would measure the length of your gap and make sure the device is not too long or short. I am definitely recommending these to all my friends!",

They are keyed so that one is for each side of the console. You can switch them, but the cell phone holder slot is only on one side (thus if you don't want the slot you can always flip them over).How high or low they sit depends on how you mount them. As long as it's a tight fit you can have them very high, somewhere in the middle, or all the way down. Either way is good - it'll keep your phone or other pocket items from sliding down beneath the seat, it's just how easy it is to get to.I have a Sonata from the early 2010s and you can see in the pictures how it fits - it seems to work very well.Time will tell how sturdy the placement is (ie if they can go up or down with you sitting there and the cushion compressing and uncompressing).All in all it seems like an nice usability upgrade.",

                "reviewText": "I put these gap fillers in an older model Dodge Ram Pickup. The installation took less than a minute and the way the seats are positioned the Gap Filler sat well below the cushioning top. My center console has pocket openings for letter type items so I had to push the Filler below the pockets to get a secure fit.The filler itself has a single, deep cutout on its top which was a feature I was looking for. They are handy to have for small items you want close by, but don't have room on your center console area. Some installations compress the cutouts and reduce that storage space area.My only difficulty was the area around the set belt buckle. The connection point didn't allow me to push the filler down as far as I would have liked it to sit, but it still works resting at the top of the buckle attachment point.",

                "reviewText": "These gap fillers fit my 2019 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid just fine, though it can be confusing to know which one goes on which side. There\u2019s definitely a left one and a right one. You\u2019ll want the contoured side of the gap filler to be touching the seat you\u2019re putting it against, which makes for a more snug fit. Another thing to note is that if you\u2019re vertically challenged like me, you\u2019ll have your seat pulled more to the front, which means that you\u2019ve got part of the gap filler that\u2019s forward of the center console hanging a little bit loose. It\u2019s not a huge deal but it does look a little bit floppy. The fillers look more custom fitting when my husband\u2019s driving and the seat is pulled back more, making the product more fully wedged between the seat and the center console. I chose this product because it has one long slot for whatever you choose to put in it vs. two slots that other products have. I felt like that would give me more options. So far I\u2019ve slid a pack of gum in it, and my phone. Pretty handy. The product is black which is nice because it matches my seats, but not only does it catch things that may otherwise slide through the cracks, it catches crumbs and other random pieces of debris that collect as you drive. I just use my hand vac to suck the dirt out from time to time. I like not losing my keys or other items to the gap. For my car at least and at my seat position, I could probably use a shorter one so there\u2019s nothing flopping around.",
