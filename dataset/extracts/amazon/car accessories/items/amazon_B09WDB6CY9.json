After carefully removing our old scratch protectors, we carefully installed one of these on our car. Without making slits in the sticker, it would not lay flat in the curved/cupped handle indent on our car. It had all kinds of wrinkles in it and just looked like crap. We peeled it back off and returned them to Amazon.As for the thickness... they're really thin and flimsy feeling. They were not at all what we were hoping for.Overall, we do not recommend these. Disappointing.",
