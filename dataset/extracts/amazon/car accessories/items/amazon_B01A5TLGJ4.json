                "reviewText": "I live in New England. Summer is beach and sand. Winter is snow and salt and slush. Spring and Fall are seemingly never ending rain. So, I've had all weather floor mats and trunk / cargo liners in every car I've owned for decades.1.) They trap a lot of nasty stuff so it doesn't end up in the factory carpeted floor mats.2.) They wear much better than a carpeted floor mat. No wear spots wear your heel rests.3.) They are much easier to clean using soap, water, and a stiff brush.4.) Your car will smell and look cleaner. I'm a clean freak.My go to solution used to be that other brand (WeatherTech). But they have priced themselves out of the market as far as I'm concerned. I just bought 2 new cars between June and November. 2 identical Nissan Altima SL's, one Gunmetal Gray and one Pearl White tricoat. Both have a black interior. The \"W\" brand was gonna cost $242 per car. $110 for floor mats and $132 for a trunk liner. Or $484 to protect both cars.I found these \"trim to fit\" universal mats on Amazon for $30 or a 73% savings. I found a custom fit trunk liner here for $60 or a 55% savings. Total for 2 cars $180 vs $484. No contest.So I got these mats yesterday. Measuring and trimming took about 1/2 hour. As mentioned in the product listing, a pair of good, sharp scissors made for easy cutting. Even without a custom fit, I'd say I achieved about 95% coverage vs the factory carpeted floor mats. Way better than no protection at all and good enough for me. They look fine. Would a custom design fit better? Yes, but only about 5% better. Is that worth it at 3.7X the price? Not to me. You be the judge.The rubber is heavy enough to stay in place and there are rubber nubs molded into the bottom to keep them from sliding around. The rubber is also plenty heavy enough to stand up to a decade or more of wear. I actually like the water containment barrier design on these better than the expensive brand.The trunk liner was a different story. At $60 for a custom fit design, there is zero trimming involved. Just toss it in the trunk and shimmy it into place. There's a nice high lip all the way around. The surface is textured for some anti-slip to keep cargo from sliding around. There are channels to contain spills so liquids won't slosh around. And the fit is equal to a WeatherTech liner at 2.2X the price. So I absolutely couldn't justify the extra cost.I just saved myself $304 ($323 with sales tax) and have my new cars well protected. Big smiles.",

                "reviewText": "These fit okay. They don't fit the drivers side of my 2022 Subaru outback well, I had to trim it so small so there wasn't a weird lifting situation by the left foot rest area, which means the whole area under the gas and break pedals are exposed. If my shoes are muddy that area is still super unprotected.I also had to cut the two back mats into two separate pieces, so there's a lot that exposed back there too.There is also an intense smell I hate, I'm hoping that goes away otherwise I'll just have to toss them.But they'll do for now.",
