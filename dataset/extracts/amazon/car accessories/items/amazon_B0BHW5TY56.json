                "reviewText": "I originally bought the \"trash can that fits in your cup holder\" but then realized that this would only fit a few tissues. I drive an SUV and have a toddler, so I knew i had to buy something bigger. After searching high and low I decided to give this one a chance. This trash compartment comes in folded and uses stiff bands to keep the top in shape. They go out on the OUTSIDE of the bag (and under the handle) because the instructions did not really indicate this. They can be a pain to place, but I finally got them in! This thing is a size of a lunch box and completely waterproof inside. So that means, cleaning is a breeze. The opening is on the top in which you can throw things in. So, just make sure that if you have liquids inside, to not let this thing roll around your car. You'll be sad, but in the meantime, you'll be happy you got this. Item is study, looks great and and even better price!",

Was easy to put together. It helped to add a small piece of cardboard inside the back part of the bag to reinforce the backing a little better. I don't think the bag needed the reinforcement though but where I wanted it placed, I think helped it to stay in place.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit disappointed in the cheap look to this, but it does it's job sufficiently. I don't like the awkward way it hangs from the car seat, and the top flaps that the trash is put into are very cheaply put together, but it works to collect trash as advertised. The plastic pieces to make the sides rigid and make the can hold it's shape are hard to put in, and one side had to be forced and worked at for a long time to get it in, again because it is cheaply made, so the sides were not uniformly stitched. For the price, it is sufficient, but don't expect it to hold up to any rough use, or heavy trash. For your basic wrappers and tissues etc it is fine. It is not very large, so trash from a McDonald's value meal will pretty much fill it unless you tear up your cup and fry container into small pieces. If you get a plastic cup from another restaurant, expect to need to empty this can every time. If I had it to do again, I would spend a little more and pay better attention to the quality and size as well as how it would attach to the seat, or other ways to secure it in my car. It is fine for small paper trash in a car bigger than mine (I have a compact car so it is right in the lap of any backseat passenger, or I have to uninstall/reinstall every time). Other than the cheap look of the materials, and it not being a good fit for me and my car, it is suitable. It is basically as advertised.",

                "reviewText": "We bought these HOTOR Car Trash Cans when we were going on our cruise in 2023 and were going to be in our car for 7+ hours driving to the port. We had 5 people in a F-150 and instead of using these as trash cans as intended we actually used them for snack storage so that the passengers in the back could have their snacks in front of them if they needed them on the long drive. But even after the cruise they\u2019re still in my truck and we now use them as trash cans when we need them. They hang easily on the back of the seat and are out of the way of the passengers in the back plus the passenger sitting in the seat its hanging on. We REALLY hate dirty cars, so these bags really help keep the truck tidy.Would definitely recommend these to those looking for a trash can for their vehicle. They are easy to use and install in the vehicle and work great! And when they need to be cleaned you just take them off the seat and wipe out with a wet cloth.",
