                "reviewText": "I was really excited about these since they were cheap and cute. Mainly wanted them because they glowed in the dark. However, that is not the case. They do look like the photos and the quality of the cap feels stronger than the standard cap covers. As is its a little harder to break than the originals but other than that, its not really what it advertised as. I had let the caps sit in the sun all day and put them in a dark room, still didn\u2019t glow. If you want a better cap covering it, this is okay but if you want the glow n\u2019 the dark effect you might wanna look somewhere else. Or get glow in the dark clear polish to put over it.",
