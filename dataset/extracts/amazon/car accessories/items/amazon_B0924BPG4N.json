It does have many flaws for example some bits of the wire the lighting is somewhat messed up\u2026. the wire makes a weird beeping noise that you can faintly hear but does get annoying with time and lastly these lights are not as bright as i imagined them to be as shown in the images maybe because it\u2019s still light out but not as shown as the image\u2026 not bad for the price but looks tacky in my opinion",

                "reviewText": "I installed these on a Nissan Altima model year that ranges from 2019-2022 , therefore my review can help someone who has the same car as me. Let me start off with basic notes :The LED strip fitment was perfect , the gaps that i tucked them in weren\u2019t that much of a struggle , it wasn\u2019t loose and also not thick to to the point where it\u2019s pushes out through those gaps. The tool provided was REALLY helpful and will be your BEST FRIEND through the process in making the spaces in between the gaps in order to fit the LED strips.I would still HIGHLY suggest you to have a 2nd person to help you out installing them as its no easy feat to do by yourself alone.Install : 3.5 out of 5 stars.Do you need a wire auto guy to install them for you ? Not really and tbh not at all! I did them and you don\u2019t need to know anything about wiring since all you\u2019re doing is pushing them in the crevices of the gaps you want to install them.Next , as for the brightness , it\u2019s about right! Not too bright but also not too dim , at night.In the daylight though , you wont notice the light that much , you\u2019ll just end up seeing the red color of the LED strip , since the wire is of colored red.Brightness : 3.8 out of 5 stars.Lastly , the actual LED red color of the wire is not too obnoxiously RED , \u2014 its more of an orange red which was perfect since my car has orange red glow accent light on some buttons.Overall : 4 out of 5 starsUpdate , i will say , be careful when cleaning your car on the daily and accidentally always spraying and/or rubbing the wire with chemicals because as time goes by it will definitely start to fade and have/show areas where color has faded slightly due to the cleaning of your interiors and accidentally wiping areas of the strip with chemicals or whether its the guys at the car wash using their towels and chemicals wiping on areas where the wires are.",
