                "reviewText": "I gave this 3 stars only because it doesn't work well for the purpose. The loop of the hook is shallow that whatever you put on it falls out. It is easy to install. Looks sturdy and durable BUT doesn't serve well. I wanted to return this but the window for return had closed.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nicely designed hook. Initially bought it for a midsized SUV, but the fit was awkward as the seats are thicker/wider. Found a good use for them in a midsize sedan, and they hooked and wrapped around the shape of the seat perfectly!! Works great for hanging a grocery bag, or hand bag or even slightly larger items. Easy to reach if you're sitting in the front seat and reach back to access the item that is hung.",
