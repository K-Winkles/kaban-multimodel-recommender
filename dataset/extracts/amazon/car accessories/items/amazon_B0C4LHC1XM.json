I've held off on getting a car trashcan for so long because I thought it was silly, but every time I got in my car and saw my trash dump of empty wrappers and water bottles in my passenger seat I'd get so annoyed, so I knew it was time. This car trash can is so cute and it really does help, and it holds a good amount even in the 2Gallon size. It's the perfect size for your average plastic shopping bag to go into if you'd like to line it, and it even has little hooks on the side to hold it in place so it doesn't fall down into the container. It fits so easily onto the back of my passenger seat headrest and the strap is adjustable to really help keep it in place. Honestly, for a few bucks this thing really is worth it, whether you practically live in your car or you have kids or whatever the case may be.",
