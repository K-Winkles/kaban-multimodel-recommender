Now I can have everything stored in this and it's easily accessible if my grandchildren ( or anyone) is in my back seat and needs something. It was really easy to place in my car and, trust me, it doesn't move. Those Velcro stickers that attach it to the back of the seats ( along with the straps) are really strong. Now I am able to place my little car first aid kit, water bottles, emergency blanket, map, etc in the bags and my granddaughters little neck pillows snap on to the straps so they can reach them easily when we are traveling. It has a nice look to it also when you open the back of my car and look in.",

The only complain I have is that the fabric isn't as high of quality as I expected from the image, it a bit thin and It doesnt lay at flat as I thought it would. Still, it fits in the back of my Subaru Forester well and has totally changed the look of my trunk!",

                "reviewText": "The photos always show these storage bags as being rectangular in shape and stiff when they're really just thin nylon bags stitched together with velcro strapping and a buckle and huge logo printed on them. Sure, they hold some stuff but they're not very sturdy and tend to become overweighted easily and sag downward even with some paper towel rolls. I personally would have passed on it if I knew they were this cheap. If they had a stiff insert to help hold the shape of each compartment they'd be more useful. There are many similar item on Amazon. My advice is just to get the appropriately sized plastic tote and store everything in that.",

So if it\u2019s stuff a bit much, they don\u2019t close tight.Buckles that can adjust would have made it perfect. Maybe they have one & I didn\u2019t search more. thank You",
