                "reviewText": "TL;DR: Yep, go ahead and get this one!I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations for an inexpensive 12V tire inflator, but this little thing turns out to punch way above its weight in terms of how well it works given the size and price. In fact, I was surprised by how small it is\u2014I didn't realize that it's not much bigger than the size of a shoe. It's quick and easy to use, a totally straightforward piece of machinery that lets you set the pressure level you're looking for, flip a switch, and get what you want.My wife's car has a tire with a bit of a slow leak, so we put this in the back of her car to keep it topped off. She's normally not one to mess around with even this kind of routine maintenance, a little unsure about making sure she does things properly, but after a couple of tries she's had no problem taking care of keeping her wonky tire topped off herself. It's a simple plug and play operation.Good things: It's small\u2014surprisingly small\u2014and lightweight. It's very easy to hook it up, punch in the pressure you want, and get it pumping. Despite its small size, it doesn't take very long at all to add several pounds to a tire. The cord is long enough to do the job. It even comes with a built-in flashlight. If you don't run the pump, you can also check your pressure with it by just hooking it up.Neutral things: The air hose is really short. It's not a big deal, because the pump is light enough that in practice you can get it into position anyway, but it does seem awkward at first. The light weight of the pump itself is great for hauling it around from tire to tire, but also means that when it's running the pump vibrates itself around on the ground. You kind of want to keep a foot on it while it runs.Bad things: The 12V cord is pretty thin and flimsy. I always feel like I'm going to trash it just moving the pump around, although nothing bad has actually happened so far. The cord isn't a separate piece, either, which means that putting away the pump neatly is a bit of an affair: you wind up with the pump and then this roll of cord (with a chunky lighter plug on it) hanging awkwardly off the end of the machine.The upshot: It's really inexpensive and it works great. I'm extremely happy with this air pump and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. For all my griping above, those things are minor. Fundamentally it's a great product that does the job well, at a price that's more than reasonable. You'll be perfectly happy with this thing.",

                "reviewText": "On a recent trip, we had a difficult time finding a service station with a functioning air compressor when our tire pressures dropped due to a large temperature swing. Once we were home, I made it a priority to get a portable compressor in each of our vehicles. I've done some fairly thorough testing and these units have so far proven to effective, efficient and easy to use. They have aired tires up quickly, and shut off at the selected pressure. They're compact and lightweight. Hooking up the power cord and valve connector is easy and intuitive. They'll not replace my garage compressor, but to keep in the car for occasional use they appear to be perfect. I found a small cheap tool bag to keep things together in the cars. Only suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to provide a storage bag to keep them in. I found a small cheap tool bag to keep things together in the cars. I'll feel better when I'm traveling, and even more so when my kid is traveling - knowing there is a compressor handy just in case.",

                "reviewText": "Only used it once but straight out of the box I was able to top off all 4 tires in less then 10 mins (5-10 psi per tire) , without any issues and it stopped at desired PSI. Keep in mind the unit is small which means it can over heat if were to run nonstop for multiple vehicle, let it cool down. For the price seems to be worth keeping on hand to keep tire pressure accurate and small enough to pack for a road. I used it outside the sound level was typical of a unit this size it was not obnoxiously loud.",

This inexpensive yet highly impressive product has become an essential part of my car accessories, offering reliability and peace of mind during unexpected situations.I initially purchased this portable air compressor to keep in my car for emergencies, and it has surpassed my expectations. The digital pressure gauge provides accurate readings, allowing me to inflate my car tires to the recommended pressure with ease. The 12V DC auto pump operates efficiently, ensuring a quick and hassle-free inflation process.The true test came during a road trip when I experienced an unexpected tire pressure issue almost 350 miles away from home.

This little device turned a potentially disastrous situation into a manageable one. I had to fill the tire seven times on my way back, but each time, this device performed flawlessly. It not only saved me from the hassle of leaving my car hundreds of miles away but also eliminated the stress of arranging transportation for my family.The compact and portable design of this air compressor makes it a convenient companion for any road trip or daily commute. Its affordability, coupled with its impressive performance, makes it a must-have for every car owner.

I needed to use it this winter and it worked perfectly in -5C (20F) temperatures. Filled my low tire quickly. Other great feature is that you can set your PSI on the compressor to automatically shut off when it reaches desired pressure. Nice and compact, I store it in my tire compartment in my SUV. So far, happy with this purchase.",
