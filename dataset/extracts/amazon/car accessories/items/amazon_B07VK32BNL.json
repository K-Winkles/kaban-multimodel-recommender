                "reviewText": "I am a forever sniffly girl- constantly sneezing and sniffling even with medicine and shots. This is such a great little item. And by far my favorite in the car. The tissues are a pretty good quality. And the come out easily making them safe to grab while driving. These save me so much nose pain too. The amount of times I have had to use a rough napkin I found has been far too many. Not only that, but it\u2019s just great security knowing I always have tissues on hand. But not in a box flying around the car. Or those tiny travel packs that are gone in 10 minutes. An absolute buy for anyone with allergies.",

The clips are a little narrow so you won\u2019t be able to use the visor mirror that you install this on but that doesn\u2019t bother me enough to even remove a star.

The few tissues that come with it are smaller than regular tissues but regular ones do fit in it just fine. We keep ours clipped to the drivers visor which is handy. The clips are very strong so there's no danger of it falling off while driving. An excellent item!",
