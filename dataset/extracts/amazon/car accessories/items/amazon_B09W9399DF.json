It holds a LOT of change and the coins are easy to put in and take out even for someone who suffers with arthritis.I saw many reviews where customers were displeased with the lid, stating that it doesn't latch. Well...it's not designed to latch. If you look at the product there are no tabs or indents that would indicate it's a latching lid. And if you read the full description of the product it says \"The coin case box has a handy flip lid to conceal the coins from view\". The lid is not intended to latch. It's only to conceal the coins from view in the event that someone is looking in your vehicle and wants to steal something.Great product!",

This was a game changer to help organize it all! I appreciate the fact it actually has a slot for pennies as many similar products do not. These also make it super easy to gather needed coins when using cash to pay at drive thru restaurants!",
