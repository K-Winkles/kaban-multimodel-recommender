                "reviewText": "Love the teak scent, but no clue what part of it translates to traditional 'teak' wood to be named as such. This smells exactly like a spiced flavor gumdrop.. depending on the brand it would either be the white or red (non-cinnamon) gumdrop... Think sweet clove, maybe hints of nutmeg, but subtle and classy. This is definitely NOT a nasty cinnamon/spice kitchen candle scent, so don't let the 'spice' term mislead or deter you. I just wish it came in the 3 pack refills!I left it in it's original package with the just the end cut off and stuck it right on the visor clip, the scent lasts easily over a month and I don't have to worry about it accidentally sliding over and being in direct contact with my visor or accidentally putting my hand on it when I flip the visor up/down. BONUS, since it's magnetic, I also stuck the stone (still in packaging with one end open) directly on a metal AC vent cover in my house and it made the room smell great for weeks.",

                "reviewText": "I was very excited for this product, because so many reviews mentioned how strong the scent was but I don\u2019t know if I got a defective stone. The scent is so minimal. I can only smell it when I hold the stone under my nose. When I get in the car, there\u2019s not an aroma of scent. The traditional hanging car fresheners are much stronger than this.I do really enjoy the sleek look of it, though, so reading two stars.",
