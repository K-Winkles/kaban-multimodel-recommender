                "reviewText": "We own 6 of these now. The oldest have been in near daily service for about 18 months.Due to the nature of our small business, these are used frequently in multiple vehicles. The dimensions are well designed when expanded or collapsed. When collapsed, they stow easily in the foot well behind either driver or passenger in our mid-size vehicles. When expanded, they fit perfectly on the rear seats. We can fit them parallel to the length of the vehicle or perpendicular. When they are perpendicular, a bit will overhang the seat bottom. But even with an overflowing tote, they ride and wear great.In our Toyota Highlander, I can fit 4 in the back with the third row seating folded down.A typical day might find me buying dozens or hundreds of business and ordinal items at several stops. I fill the totes, and everything from liquids, gels, soft food items, etc rides securely without hard items jostling into fragile items because of the compartments working with shopping bags.Later it's time to ship packages through UPS, FedEx, USPS, etc. It's convenient and impressive to stack these totes full of various sized parcels. Carry them with the handles, or stack them on a cart. Then unload and collapse the tote for the next day.When the bag is collapsed they stack perfectly in our home in the cubbies of the drop zone right by the garage to be ready for the next day.The oldest are around 18 months at the time I write this. Other than some scuff marks, they are wearing very well. I haven't had any tears, pulled stitches, etc. They're also convenient to take into stores. Expand one into the bottom of a shopping cart and fill it as you shop. If you like playing tetras with your items it's possible to stack two totes full of items in a cart with most ordinary items. No bags. No waste.",

I didn\u2019t want grease on my seats ended up loving it so much it\u2019s in the backseat and I use it every day. it\u2019s a little flimsy and I could use a little bit more sturdiness but overall I\u2019m very happy with the price point and the quality it\u2019s got tons of straps to make sure it\u2019s secured to the seat so it won\u2019t go flying and it\u2019s aesthetically pleasing.",

                "reviewText": "Very, VERY pleased with this organizer. This is easily the BEST car organizer I've ever seen. Excellent quality. Sturdy. Esthetically pleasing. Great size. SO versatile. Extremely well designed. Pockets galore...too many to count (most are expandable, one with a velcro cover), and several built-in options to divide larger areas on the fly. The solid bottom keeps the organizer in shape when in use and easily folds in half around the centre divider so you can flatten the organizer quickly without disassembling anything, resulting in a self contained unit (yay, no pieces floating around and getting lost in the vehicle!). Toggles on each end make it very easy to keep folded to store flat and tuck away when not in use. Good-sized, sturdy hooks and straps allow you to tie it down if needed. Sturdy handles on each end make it easy to lift the whole thing out and carry the contents into the house in one go, so this is going to revolutionize my shopping...Going from store to store for this and that, when I get back to my vehicle, I can plop what I buy in the pockets, confident that things won't rattle around and they'll stay safe until I get home. I can see myself using this organizer for a quick grocery shop, filling it up inside a cart---an easy lift from cart to car to house! I LOVE this thing. A game changer for me. Highly, highly recommend.",
