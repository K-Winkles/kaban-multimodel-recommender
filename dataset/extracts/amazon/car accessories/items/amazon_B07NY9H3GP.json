                "reviewText": "I have 3 kids (8, 7, and 4), and my poor 2010 CRV has been an absolute champ through all of the changes that can bring. However lately there has just been SO MUCH CRAP being left in my car by my kids (and myself, truth be told) between schools and each of their respective activities. Gymnastics, soccer, dance, school, MY OWN SCHOOL AND WORK.... always just through in the back seat on the floor. Totally hoped to get these to create a cool vibe like the ad has, but reality was a little different. Once I clicked these into place at the bottom of my seat and at the headrest, all I had to do was tighten them to size. My kids have assigned seats for the most part because I'm tired of the bickering, so I just put everyone's stuff in closest to wear their seat was, with the middle sitter getting a little bit of her stuff on both sides to be fair. There's plenty of space for an iPad to be put into place once I finally get the screen they cracked repaired, but for now I have soccer cleats in one compartment, ballet slippers in another, there are some books in a couple of spots, scrunchies, a brush, shoot I even think there's a deodorant organized back there somewhere with the extra hair stuff.We've only had them in place for a couple of weeks, but it's been a game-changer for my kids since they're so territorial about absolutely everything so they'll move someone's stuff to their own \"spot\" in the organizer which helps keep it neat back there. If I'm helping my 4 yr old get buckled and ask oh-so-innocently, \"Hey kid 1.... is kid 2's thing in your spot over there? I must have done that accidentally, I'm so sorry!\"... they'll start double-checking EVERYTHING and reclaiming their things' special places.My kids have been tricked into cleaning my car. The clutter is off the back seat and the floor. Yes, there are still French fries on my floor and in the crevices of the backseat, but I am down to 90% less mess back there. I am absolutely confounded at my own stupidity in not getting these sooner.",
