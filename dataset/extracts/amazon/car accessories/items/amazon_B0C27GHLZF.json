The bag is TSA compliant which was the most important thing for me, but it is also well made, very sturdy, and the shape of it makes it easy to organize my liquids by laying them down rather than forcing them all to stand up. Even the packaging was beautiful. 10/10 would reccomend.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this makeup bag because it looks like a MUCH more expensive one that I have wanted to buy. I bought the expensive one (brand name starts with a T) thinking it would be a better, more sturdy bag, better zipper, etc. Wrong. This one is actually better in a couple of areas: it has thicker, more sturdy plastic \"windows\", and the zipper is tighter and seems as good or smoother than the T one. The T brand does have cooler colors (more neutrals which make them look more $$) and you just have to decide if that is worth 4 or 5 times the price of this one. Yes, you read that right. Otherwise, they seem very similar in style, quality of material, size. They both could use a loop handle, however. Overall I am pleased with its size (will fit into a carry on) and love the look / style. And I love that there are windows on each side, allowing me to see eactly what's inside.",

After customer service had saw my review, they personally messaged me and I had a great experience with them. I know have both sizes and am absolutely loving them. I use the larger one to fit all of my everyday makeup and brushes. The medium one is perfectly sized for my work bag to hold all my necessities. The quality of these are phenomenal. They are sturdy, hold shape very well, and the zippers are strong as well.I could find a million uses for more of these!!!",
