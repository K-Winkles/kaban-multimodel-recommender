I will purchase another. I\u2019m hoping having two at the same time will help with the strength and longevity.",

You're supposed to put the wood away when you're not in the car or I think during summer months. I haven't done that, I bought it for my boyfriends car. The smell is really nice, however it was really overpowering the first week it was in there (probably should have put it in the black bag, but it's his car and his nose). I got this for his in his Christmas stocking and it's now almost the second week of February and it still smells good. I'd purchase this again for sure",

It\u2019s unrealistic to be messing with an air freshener every time you enter and exit the vehicle.If changes were made and advertised, I would try this product again. For example, if no retention bag was necessary, and the scent was advertised to last 6 weeks. Even if it only lasted 4 weeks, I could get on board. I have little kids that smell like McDonald\u2019s and feet.The amber scent was pleasant. Everything but the longevity is nice.",
