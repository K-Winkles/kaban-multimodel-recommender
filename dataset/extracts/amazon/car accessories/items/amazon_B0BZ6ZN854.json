The dividing squares are sturdy and stay in place. Folds flat for storage. I think I\u2019ll order another for larger shopping trips (Costco).",

                "reviewText": "Hey fellow car wranglers and trunk aficionados, gather 'round for a tale of triumph over automotive chaos! I recently acquired the Car Trunk Organizer and Storage, and let me tell you, it's the hero my trunk never knew it needed.Picture this: My trunk used to resemble a messy game of automotive Tetris gone wrong. Enter the Car Trunk Organizer \u2013 the Chuck Norris of storage solutions. It tamed my trunk's unruly ways like a dad with a stern look at the messy room.Installation was easier than explaining why I need three different-sized screwdrivers. The dividers are like the United Nations of trunk space, keeping groceries, sports gear, and emergency snacks in their designated zones. No longer do my eggs perform a perilous dance with the gallon of milk.Now, when I pop the trunk, angels might as well sing a harmonious chorus. It's so organized; I half expect my socks to start folding themselves. I've even got room for a mini-fridge if I ever decide to turn my trunk into a mobile snack bar.But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance? The extra pockets! It's like the organizer knew I had a secret stash of dad jokes waiting to be unleashed. Now, I can surprise unsuspecting passengers with a pun or two from my trunk's humor arsenal.In conclusion, if you want your trunk to go from a chaotic mess to a symphony of order, get yourself the Car Trunk Organizer. It's dad-approved, and let's face it \u2013 if it can handle a dad's organizational demands, it can handle anything. Trunk peace out!",
