                "reviewText": "These are to be used in the interior of a car, but I have never done that. Should be cool, though. They make me feel creative, and I use these little lights in many other ways. I use them at my desk. Sometimes I use the white setting as a little flashlight. There are many color options and a color changing option as well. My daughter and I convert dollhouses to themed exhibits, like a haunted house or Christmas chalet. We use these lights in the dollhouses, and they are very effective in highlighting features therein.",

My 2 year old likes to hold it an play with it instead of letting it light the backseat....but hey, he's not freaked out by the dark anymore so win win.Also placed one over the coffee area in the kitchen. Gives just enough light",
