The installation was a breeze, and it stuck securely to my side mirror. Once in place, it significantly improved my visibility, especially when changing lanes or merging onto highways.The wide-angle view it provides is fantastic \u2013 I can see vehicles in my blind spot clearly, which gives me peace of mind while driving. What I appreciate most is its durability; it has stayed put through all sorts of weather conditions, from scorching heat to heavy rain.This little mirror has made me a more confident and safer driver, and I wouldn't want to be without it. If you're looking to enhance your driving experience and safety, I highly recommend adding a blind spot mirror like this to your vehicle. It's a small investment that makes a big difference!",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR @ the bottom.Alright, so I bought a 2017 Honda Accord EX-L V6. This car is pretty nice except for the fact the rearview mirrors aren't wide enough. Sure you have the blind spot camera on the right rearview mirror but not the left. Regardless there's quite a big blind spot especially on the left. I've been honked at several times when merging left thinking it was clear (clearly wasn't). I could have saved money and got the trim with blind spot monitoring but who needs that? Evidently I do but it's too late so I bought this product instead and it has worked spectacularly well for the last year and 3 months I've had it on my rearview mirrors. These mirrors have yet to fall off. They're ridiculously easy to install and perfect for the price. It even comes with little swivels if you want more precise fine tuned adjustment on your mirrors. Ever since I installed these I haven't had to look over my left shoulder like death is following me. Merging became a breeze. These even stayed glued on through numerous drive thru car washes. I'd buy these for my next vehicle but I purchased a Honda so I'll probably grow old in it.TL;DR: THESE STICK, DON'T FALL OFF FROM WASHES, HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY, AND THEY NEARLY LOOK OEM.",

                "reviewText": "I recently had the opportunity to acquire a set of blind spot mirrors for my 2017 Chevy Volt, and I'm genuinely pleased with the transformative impact they've had on my overall driving experience. My primary purpose for purchasing these mirrors was to enhance visibility and driving safety, and I'm delighted to report that they have excelled in both areas.I found the adjustable nature of these blind spot mirrors particularly satisfying. Being able to fine-tune their positioning allowed me to customize my field of vision precisely, significantly reducing the common problem of blind spots. Now, vehicles that were previously obscured are easily visible in the enhanced, convex view these mirrors provide.Furthermore, I appreciate that these mirrors have a clean, uncluttered design. There is no distracting frame around them, which maximizes the mirror's surface area and ensures an unobstructed view.In conclusion, these blind spot mirrors have made a significant difference in my daily commutes. They are efficient, functional, and aesthetically pleasing while meeting expectations. They provide what I needed in a blind spot mirror and have proven to be an invaluable addition to my 2017 Chevy Volt. For those seeking to improve their driving safety and convenience, I recommend these mirrors.",

This second time, it arrived one day earlier than it had said and the packaging for the mirrors was a different design.The blind spot mirrors themselves were the same shap but once I put them on I compared them to the first pair and the second ones were noticeably larger and more bulky than the first.Not enough of an issue to get a return in my opinion as the blind spot mirrors work well either way.So far they have stuck pretty well with no peeling as of yet.",
