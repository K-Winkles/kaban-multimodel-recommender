I own a car that has been sitting for just over 3 yeasts collecting dust,dirt,sand(idk how\ud83d\ude02) and literally everything that you can think of. I was doubtful it would work. I first started off with cleaning my windows and it came out crystal clear (I suggest you use only one for your windows if you can. The wipe is usually soaked in cleaner so you can reuse it). I was impressed. I then took out ONE literally ONE wipe and started going ham. I cleaned my entire door with one wipe. I noticed the wipe goes dry after a little but that\u2019s no problem. Even when the wipes dry it still collects all the dirt and grime. I then use the same dirty rag to clean some parts of my exterior and it worked. Don\u2019t even get me started on the polisher it worked wonderfully. Thanks for reading the review and just to let you know. I stopped half way through cleaning to write this review. I will forever buy this product to clean my car and my cars in the future. So with this all being said DON\u2019T THINK JUST BUY!!",

                "reviewText": "The cleaner and protection wipes are 100% perfect. They work exactly as advertised and I'm completely happy with them. HOWEVER, and this is a big however... The glass wipes are completely useless. There is something in the wipes that makes me have to wipe again every 2-3 days. I thought at first that my inside windshield was just a little dirty and that's why the wipes didn't work so well. But I've almost used every single wipe in the canister at this point, and every time I use the wipes it seems fine. Then after a couple of days I start to see streaks again and have to reapply. I switched and just bought Windex and a roll of paper towels(total of $5 for about 6 months worth of Windex). I wet the paper towel with Windex and wipe the window and it's weeks before I have to redo it.I'm very disappointed, but I think they are putting something in the glass cleaner so that you need to use it very frequently. I'm still giving it a 4* review because the other two products are top-notch at cleaning and protecting your car's interior. It's impressive how well the protecting wipes work.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I like the product, the tubs seal well, so no need to worry about drying out. My favorite of the three was the cleaning wipes as they were very very effective. My least favorite was the glass wipes, I had to use 5-7 wipes just to make sure my window wasn't left with streaks, The window wipes didn't feel very damp and made for a tough cleaning job. The protectant wipes were good, they did the job but did leave a bit of a streaky look at times, (its possible that its user error but I've tried many different application techniques).",
