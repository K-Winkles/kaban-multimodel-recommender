I've tried a few other units that were similar looking but this one is a favorite. It's easy to put coins in, the spring mechanism works well, and it fits in the car cup holder. The same for removing coins, it's easy to slide them out. Compared to other coin holders that I've tried this one has been the easiest to use and holds more. The only thing I'd suggest is that they offer it in different colors. This is an honest review for the item I paid for, I received no reward or bribe for writing it. I recommended this car coin holder if you are in the market for one.",

After having to pay to get my coins converted to paper money I\u2019m trying to use them more and not let them weigh down my purse. This holder could be a bit taller to hold more coins and be taller than the cup holder in my car so it is easier to get to the coins. It falls down in the cup holder so I have to pull it out to get the coins. If I need to I can fit it in my purse but when it is full it is a bit heavy. Best for drive threw orders, etc. Though the coins stay in tightly and don\u2019t fall out when on its side.",

                "reviewText": "After years of keeping change in my car in a baggie, an empty pill bottle, or an empty tic tac container, I finally broke down and bought an item specifically geared towards change. I must say it is very sturdy and fits well in the cup holder. I didn't count how many coins in each slot I could fit, but I will say it is quite a bit. It's really easy to remove the coins. Just add a little pressure with your thumb and slide it towards your hand and they pop out. For some of them though it was hard to load because of the tension in the spring's but I would rather have that than it be too loose and have change falling out. I do keep it in my door cup holder considering I don't want it in view as people walk by my car and could see it and possibly steal it. Overall it is great and I highly recommend it.",

My only gripe is that it\u2019s kind of short I thought it was be slightly taller as it would\u2019ve been easier to take out the coins but it\u2019s as high or slightly below my cup holder height so I have to dig a bit.
