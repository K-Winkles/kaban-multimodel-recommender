                "reviewText": "I would have given this 5 stars instead of 4, the good- the item was very easy to set up and it is extremely well constructed and durable, easy to adjust. The bad- adhesive pad doesn't bond at all to the dashboard and is hardly sticky. It was warm when I put it on(not colder from being outside) what I did was bought gorilla glue and affixed the adhesive pad to the dashboard and let it set for 15 minutes, then I assembled the holder and it albeit permanently there, works perfectly and adjustable for your preference so altogether a good product \ud83d\udc4d",
