                "reviewText": "I usually don\u2019t buy bling for my 2019 Ford Ranger, but I thought they\u2019d brighten up the cab a tad - without looking cheap. Well\u2026\u2022 I can at least say that the package arrived on time with no damage to product; that\u2019s about the positive I guess. Ok- they look kind of nice one on too.\u2022 The plastic strips are joined (or at least mine was) side to side; they separate easy enough, and of course you cut to the size needed.\u2022 Once cut, I THOUGHT they\u2019d just \u201cpush\u201d on - and they didn\u2019t. I went inside and brought out a couple different sizes of small slot screwdrivers (like used on a electronic workbench) and carefully pushed them down the \ud835\ude51\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude54 tight slot that slips over the A/C vent slats; I ended up using a medium regular sized screwdriver! Yesh!!! \ud83d\ude44\u2022 Look - I\u2019m 63, and I may not have the most nimble of digits, but come-on! I\u2019m no dummy either; I build electronic/paranormal equipment for our team, and I even have a degree - but I can say that it doesn\u2019t cover installing these little \u201cthings\u201d. They are a real pain in the butt and it took me 35 min to do one small vent\u2026 ugh!I went out to my truck this AM to get the little kit I keep to install/repair items inside it. When I sat down I took a good look at my handy work from last month- - - and they\u2019re fading in color already!! Jesh! I can\u2019t win. But, I\u2019m going outside later and going to find a \ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude4d way to put these little (REDACTED) in! Lol! I mean, they don\u2019t look bad once you get them on. I even added twenty\u2013two new words to my \u201cNavy Bad Word Lexicon\u201d, and I haven\u2019t updated that in some time! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0fDoc Lykins",
