                "reviewText": "So it kind of fails at what I would consider its main purpose, which is to prevent stuff from falling through the gap. It's too small to cover the entire gap and pretty much utterly fails to cover where the seatbelt connects, which is the hardest place to extract things that drop through.The cup holder is too small for anything larger than a 12oz can. If you have a coffee cup, forget about it. Yet it still impinges on my leg even though the car is an SUV with relatively large seats. In my other car I have a different gap filler that admittedly has less storage than this one, but the cup holder is larger, farther forward (in fact it's just in front of the seat) and sits lower. It doesn't interfere nearly as much as this one does.The other thing I don't like is that when I adjust the seat forward or backward it seems to scrape the console. I worry that this will leave marks at some point, though exactly where the scraping is happening might be below where it would be visible. I haven't spent that much time looking into it yet. If I keep this I will probably need to figure that out.On the positive side, it is much nicer looking than the other ones I've had, although the other ones are less visible so that wasn't really much concern. It also has a decent amount of storage space and in my bZ4X (which doesn't even have a glove compartment!) the storage space comes in handy. That's the reason I bought it and I think it is well engineered for this purpose.I think it could be improved by making it longer, having the cup holder extend in front of the seat and then have the part that wedges between the seat and the console made of a softer material that wouldn't scrape and could wrap around the seat belt connector. Maybe that would be hard to do in a universal way that would fit smaller vehicles so you'd have to have different sizes. Oh well, I can wish can't I!I have yet to find the perfect gap filler. It's pretty much guaranteed to have trade offs because of space considerations. This one makes compromises that some will like and others will hate. YMMV.",

My girlfriend liked them however and uses them both in her Kia Sorrento.They do intrude on the leg room - so depending on the vehicle and the riders (large or not) it may be more annoying than helpful. The racing red stitching are a nice tough \"I guess\" but they are pretty poor quality.The real benefit here is that it adds storage so if you're cramped for storage these might be the ticket. They do tend to fall out when moving the seat a little bit so they need to be re-adjusted from time to time if you're not making them permanent (which I would not recommend in even the crappiest of vehicles.)Nice little gift / novelty / toy if you ask me.",
