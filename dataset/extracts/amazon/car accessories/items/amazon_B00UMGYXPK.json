The Nuvi 55LM has speech that includes street name, and the screen includes speed limit of the road. As I was happy with the product, I purchased another Nuvi 55LM for my brother. However, the speech does not include the street name, e.g., speech says \"turn right in 0.5 miles\", instead of \"turn right in Lake View street in 0.5 miles\".I need to look up the street name from the screen to check with the street sign, which is dangerous while driving. The screen also does not look like Nuvi 55LM. My Nuvi 55LM shows both the speed limit and my current speed. The speed limit is very useful. So I was not happy with the current product, and return it. I will try to purchase Nuvi 55LM 5 again through Amazon, hopefully this time I will get the right Nuvi 55 LM.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoy my Garmin Nuvi 55lm. I personally was buying Garmin navigators since they were $999.99. While the other unit was more durable, I don't need a football to throw around. This one is light weight and an easy carry. I wish it had the Live ability to update traffic every 2 minutes but, for the price point I will use this in conjunction with my phone's gps capabilities. I like the side pictures available when exiting because it makes knowing where to go more exact.",
