                "reviewText": "I live in a colder area and since COVID started I haven't been driving my car as much, so a concern I now have is my 12V battery fainting on me during winter. This charger seemed like a quick and easy way to check if a battery needs topping up, but I did notice a difference between a gas car and a hybrid: on a gas car, turning on the dashboard will have the display show a number between 11-12V, but once the engine is turned on it would raise to 14V and remain there for as long as the engine was running. On a hybrid however, given that the electrical engine is turned on the moment the car is powered up, the display would jump immediately to 14V. For this reason, I surmise it might not be possible to get an accurate display of the 12V battery health on a hybrid through this method. I thought it was an interesting observation.",
