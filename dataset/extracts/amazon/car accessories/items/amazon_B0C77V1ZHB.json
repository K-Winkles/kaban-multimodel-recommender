My chair has really started to fall apart recently and the padding has suffered so I bought some pads to put on the arms. The problem was the pads went on with velcro and the velcro strips were snagging all my clothes.Arm covers to the rescue.I just slid these over the pads, the arm and everything and now I have the padding without the snagging! They are a nice comfortable material and they fit on easily. They even look nice and you would never know it wasn't part of the original chair. I'm very happy with them and they will be my go to if I ever need to cover another chair.",
