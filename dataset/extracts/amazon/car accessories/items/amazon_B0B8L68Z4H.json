                "reviewText": "This is my second seat cover. First one was from another company. I have had it for a few months now. It has been holding up to my 60# dog just fine. I did not realized that were the mesh part is, it has a zipper on one side. Since my dog loves to stand in the middle of the seat all the time. He has since stressed the zipper and it no longer holds together (only reason for four stars). I've zipped it a few times but it doesn't zip anymore. Not a deal breaker to me. I'm more worried about protecting my leather seats which this does just fine. The part that lays on the seat appears to be thick and durable. Clean up is a breeze with the shop vac for all the hair. I have not washed it yet.",

                "reviewText": "I just got a new Toyota 4runner and had to get it right the first time, or the girls would be staying home for a while. I liked this particular product because of its sturdy base, which, it turns out, is softer than I hoped. But overall, this is a great product. It's easy to install and, so far, has held up to my two angels. One is 85 lbs., and the other is 60 lbs. and is all muscle. I only wish the front was a little stiffer and taller.",

                "reviewText": "I loved this dog seat cover when I received it. It seemed like good quality, but within about 3 months, I started to notice tearing at the seams closest to the front seats (I do set it up as a full hammock with the straps around the front and back seats). I do have three large dogs, so perhaps it was just too much pressure on the cover, but I have purchased a cover from other brands in the past and never had this issue. I won't be buying this brand again.",
