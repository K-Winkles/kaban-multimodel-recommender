                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about this mount because frankly it looked cheap and I\u2019ve had a lot of flimsy items I order break within a week. Everyone\u2019s experience is different, but here\u2019s my two cents:CONVENIENT SET-UP/ USEAt the time I ordered this I was an Uber driver, so it was super important for me to be able to use my phone quickly take it in and out of the mount and also have high visibility. I had seen cupholder mounts, dashboard, sticky mounts, windshield suction, cup mounts, but from what I could tell the easiest, most reliable, and, least damaging to the car is the AC mount. That proved to be extremely true in using this mount, the set up took me less than two minutes and almost a year later I have never had a single issue. (The only thing to consider that might break it is either over-tightening when you\u2019re setting it up initially or if you don\u2019t use the back button to unlock the sides of the phone or tighten the fastener too much for the most part it\u2019s not an issue as long as you\u2019re even remotely careful)VALUELike I said, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of crap that breaks within a week, this is lasted me almost a year. Even though the plastic feels like it could break pretty easily, I\u2019ve never had a problem. There were other mounts that were way more expensive and because naturally, anyone would think that more expensive entire quality, I originally looked at those, but after buying a few, with the intent to figure out, which is the best, this actually stacked at the top because it\u2019s the most practical being non-electrical, easy, and cheap.MY ONLY POINT FOR IMPROVEMENTIf you live somewhere hot, and you\u2019ll have your AC blowing constantly, this might not be the amount for you. For a short period of time I was living in Texas, and when I was constantly using the AC to beat the heat, anytime I was on the phone with someone all they could hear is a blasting. All things considered, not a huge con to have)All in all, I would 10 out of 10 recommend to purchase. Came back here to buy one for my girlfriend and decided I had to leave a review.",

                "reviewText": "Only occasionally will something work as intended. I have a 1986 Buick Electra Park Avenue that, when it was manufactured, the designers at General Motors never dreamed of things like cupholders or cell phone holders. So, these now considered basic items of convenience have to be somehow added to the interior of the vehicle. The cupholders were easy but the cell phone holder was a much greater challenge. I tried the suction cup. It could hold 5,000 lbs of weight for about a minute and then about 5 minutes later it comes right off. I tried gluing a homemade holder on but it wouldn't stick and it also messed up the dashboard. Finally, I decided to try this unit and it works perfectly. The secret is in the hook which connects to the vent outlet. That appears to be a very sturdy part of the dashboard and this when connected to it, seems to hold the weight of the phone easily.I am very pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone who might have run out of other ideas as to how to mount their phones so they are not bouncing around everywhere in the vehicle.",

It hooks into most air vents and you can lock it down so it's sturdy. Fits both horizontal and vertical air vents, and you don't have to deal with suction-cups failing in the hot sun, or failing grip-clips that don't fit in narrower air vents.I take this with me traveling and it's worked in every rental car well enough, and I use it in my own car too.",

There were few occasions it would fail holding the phone and let it fly out of the handle when in some car brake instances. There's also the aspect of it that it's not easy to release the phone from the mount since I had to spam press the release button from the back like 4-5 times to get my phone off the mount instead of long pressing (it takes like 4-5 seconds more to do that, ain't nobody got time for that!)",
