It\u2019s not 100% perfectly level, but for what I need, it doesn\u2019t need to be. I wouldn\u2019t put a full to the brim cup of coffee on it, but it certainly works fine to hold my lunch and phone, book, etc. Took me a minute to figure out how to get it on (sometimes you might need to turn your wheel a bit, depending on the spokes of your particular steering wheel) but once I did, easy peasy. Easily wipable with an antibacterial wipe as well! Highly recommend for anyone that works/eats/spends a lot of time in their car.",
