                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this and even used the \"will this fit my car model\" listed on the page. But it does not. Anyone with one of the thicker window shades (1.5 or 2 inches or so) it will not fit on this and hold even one set of glasses well. I wish I had known this previously. Spots are two close together to fit multiple pairs and the sunglasses dont fit well if larger.Color is more of a beige than a true gray like some of the shades have. Magnets are pretty weak and it flips the opposite way your hand expects. Overall I wish I had gotten another one as this does not even fit one pair of sunglasses well. If you have a thicker sunshade be aware of this.",

The magnets seem strong enough. My distance glasses and sunglasses stay secure even on bumpy roads. If it broke I would buy it again.",

This holder is not only cute (red and leather), but it\u2019s sturdy. Much sturdier than others that I\u2019ve used before!!",
