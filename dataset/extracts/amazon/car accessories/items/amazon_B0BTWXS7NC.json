                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start by saying that between myself and near-constant passengers, trash can accumulate pretty quickly in my car. That being said, my overall opinion is that I love this.The item arrived scuffed/scratched and dirty straight out of the box. Due to its appearance, I was a bit disappointed with this product. It was packaged inside of a small box (no protective plastic or other inner packing) inside of an envelope so I\u2019m not convinced the marks and scratches happened during transit.Mostly, though, I adore how compact it is! It came with two rolls of trash bags decently sized, which is convenient because the overall item is so small that you\u2019ll probably change it out often. If you have small/light trash, you can store the bag rolls at the bottom of the can and still have some room.Another thing I admire is how discreet it is. Before purchasing, I would just keep a plastic grocery bag hanging from the gear shift - very unsightly and invasive upon the passenger side leg space, and pretty much just an open bag of trash at all times. Not to mention having to keep a stash of plastic bags, which I personally don\u2019t care for but deemed necessary. I love that it has the springy lid. This will clip right onto your door pocket and take up hardly any space at all.So, minus one star for its condition upon unboxing. Everything else about it is super convenient and adorable. I\u2019m considering purchasing one for each door of my car lol.",
