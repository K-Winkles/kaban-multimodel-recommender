Fast charger for sure. Also works great on my son\u2019s Amazon tablet which uses a usb-c cable. The cool thing is that I can charge both at the same time since it has 2 slots. Also has 2 usb slots that I still haven\u2019t used. It has a built in light that tells you whether or not your accessories connection has power. The price is just right for two chargers.",
