                "reviewText": "well, it lights up very well and the App works as advertised, if you want you can also use the included controller, my only critic will be the bulky adapter, most cars are coming with USB ports, don't know why they didn't included as an option. The brightness is amazing and it comes with everything you need for installation, which is done in a breeze. If you want to make it glow like in the product pictures they need to be installed in front and back below your seats if space allows, not under the console. Unless you want only the front part to be super bright (2 Lights in Driver's and Passenger's), you could install it under your console (recommended if your car is only 2-Doors or Hatchback.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this set of lights to replace one I had purchased years ago and the APP was no longer supported. I wrongfully assumed that I would be able to replace the old one with the new one and not have any issues. I took these lights out of the box and was shocked to find out that it was all in one piece. I wouldn't be able to feed the cables/wire through tight places like I could before. My vehicle has always been on the difficult side when adding things like this. So, I either have to have a bunch of unsightly wires all over and risk catching them, or I have to risk splicing the wires. I haven't decided yet what I want to do with this.\ud83d\udc3b *Statement/Disclaimer: This review is part of Amazon's Vine Program which provides products at a reduced cost in exchange for sincere/frank reviews.

                "reviewText": "In the past, I have installed similar items in the old cars that we had before, but those were flexible strips of LEDs with similar controllers. This solution is far superior.Easier to install, simply because they had more surface area to stick too where they were stuck on, and also because either end of the LEDs had loops where I was able to more securely fit them using cable ties.The wiring was sufficient to run it around the interior of a Land Rover LR4 and the lights were very satisfyingly bright, the controls are easy to understand (don't need a bluetooth app like the old ones I had in the past) and .. generally, cannot complain.Given the way that these are built, I these will also last a fair while longer than the traditional strip mounted lights.

It come with screws that stays better than 3m tape because some of the surface is kind of hard to stick with 3m tape. You could find some metal underneath of seat to screw the lights on. It's solid LED so it lighten up very pretty and it's different than Dot leds. It come with so much different mode and colors. Overall, it's very pretty led ambient light that will added a club vibe to your car and will not affect your driving.Plus, you don't have to hard wire it.",
