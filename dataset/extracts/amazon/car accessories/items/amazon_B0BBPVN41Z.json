                "reviewText": "Sunglass's always fly around my car because someone left them on the dash or on the console and more than once they fell on the floor and someone stepped on them.. This little devise just works, glass's are out of the way on the visor yet in easy reach. Its well built ( put together ) not cheap looking and to me saves me a lot of cursing when the glass's fall.. Now they are tucked away nicely on the visor - there when you need them..Excellent product.",

                "reviewText": "Very easy to install. The magnet that holds it shut is quite strong and you might want to use two hands to open it with one holding the shade. When used to clip sunglasses, I found that clipping it with the glasses pointed down, ie clasping the handles of the sunglasses with the tab, leaves the glasses hanging more loosely and swinging. The glasses seem more secure when fastened with the lenses facing up to the roof as in the photo. It seems well built and the materials appear sturdy enough for daily use. Overall, I\u2019m happy with this purchase and will keep it.",
