                "reviewText": "I have used a larger rear view mirror for about 45 years: it is not longer but is twice the height of the factory installed mirror. Made viewing better. The JOYTUTUS mirror is tall like the one I have and it is much longer so you do not have blind spots: can easily see both sides for approaching cars. I have to remove the passenger headrests in my Forrester because they block the view out the rear and side window (great design guys!). When I have passengers the headrests block seeing out the side and rear windows. The JOYTUTUS mirror helps to eliminate the side blockage and even the rear view is improved.Since this is a wide view objects appear further back than they really are. This will require some time for you to adapt but once you have used the mirror for 2-4 weeks you will not return to the factory installed mirror.Con: since this wide view you will now see yourself in the mirror every time you view it. I hate mornings but have to leave early to avoid traffic. Nothing worse than looking at myself early in the morning!",

                "reviewText": "This wide-view, rear view mirror is so easy to attach over your current mirror--there are two plastic hooks which fit over the top of your current mirror, and two spring-adjustable hooks which fit over the bottom of the mirror and provide a secure fit.The view this mirror provides is quite wide, both vertical and horizontal. You can easily see the entire back seat so you will be able to see your kids feet as well as their faces. The width of the view easily replaces a fish-eye mirror for one (and possibly both) sides of the car. I installed it in a hatchback and I find I can only adjust it to see as far forward on one side as I'd like to be able to see on both sides. I've set it so it provides more of a view on the left side (both because I find it more difficult to look over my left shoulder, and because I'm more concerned about someone coming from behind on the left). I think it could provide a more panoramic view if it were more convex, but it works well and was a good value.",
