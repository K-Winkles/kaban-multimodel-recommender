So we haven't kept any yet and really I'm glad he was because these are soooooo much better. Yes, you do have to loop bags carefully as the hook doesn't just stick out, but-the hook doesn't stick out, ya know? We aren't catching things on it when we don't mean to. They are real metal-not plastic-got caught on that once-and if they aren't real leather they are the best faux I've ever seen and at 50 y/o how many purses and boots/shoes have I seen, right? We are so impressed. We got cream for behind the front seats as our leather is cream and black for behind the rear seats because the car carpet runs up the back and it's black. Both look equally good. Very happy with purchase.",

It holds my work tote and prevents it from flying across the seat onto the floor, should I have to make a quick stop. It allows me easy access to whatever I need. My job requires me to be on the road a lot, I cover 7 states, so a lot of hours driving. I was looking for something that secured my bag while still providing access. I have the other facing the back of the seat to hold miscellaneous items. This was a great purchase and does the job I had hoped it would.",
