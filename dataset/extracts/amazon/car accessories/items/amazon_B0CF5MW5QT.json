Even with a chunky phone case it manages to slip in between whenever it gets away from me in the car. And what a struggle to retrieve it. No more! Not with this handy gap filler - it's got a nice leather feel, easy to clean. And yeah, it also keeps that gap area free from dust and dirt too because it's difficult to get a vacuum in there. It's not deep enough to store much - I can fit my phone on it's side and would probably stow a wallet just fine but I'll probably use it for extra charging cables and paper receipts and stuff to keep my car from looking cluttered.",

The black leather matches perfectly with the leather interior of my Kia. It fits perfectly, I put it on the passenger side of the car, and have had no complaints from it being in the way. I really like that there are 2 designed openings on each end that allow you to put phone cords through. I never have to fish around to find my cords anymore. The attention to detail is impressive. Very nice looking addition to my car needs. With a price tag of only $14.00 its a true bargain. It has solved a \"problem\" I needed fixing. So of course, I highly recommend it to everyone.",

I love that I have a spot to put my phone, charger, glasses, and it does not take up any extra room in the front seat. Super sturdy, and well made, I would order another for the passenger side.",
