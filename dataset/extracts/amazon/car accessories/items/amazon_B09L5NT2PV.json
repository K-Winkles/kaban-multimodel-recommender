It does reduce glare moderately from people with high beam LED lights or the trucks with 10 billion lumen light bars blasting through your rear glass. You can see a glare difference from your regular side mirrors and this attachment, so it's helpful. It's very quick and easy to install with adjustable brackets on the backside to clasp onto your rearview mirror.I recommend this if you want something for your blind spots.",

                "reviewText": "Title: A Crucial Safety Upgrade - 5 Stars for Car Rearview Mirrors!Car rearview mirrors may seem like a mundane part of our vehicles, but they play a critical role in our safety while driving. I recently upgraded my car's rearview mirrors, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. Here's why I'm giving them a well-deserved 5-star review:1. Enhanced Safety: The new rearview mirrors have significantly improved my visibility on the road. The wider field of view and anti-glare features have made night driving much safer. I can confidently change lanes and merge onto highways with ease.2. Reduced Blind Spots: These mirrors have minimized blind spots, which is crucial for preventing accidents. I feel more in control and aware of my surroundings, which adds a layer of confidence to my driving experience.3. Easy Installation: The installation process was a breeze. I didn't need to hire a professional; I was able to replace the mirrors myself with minimal tools and effort. The clear instructions provided made it a hassle-free experience.4. Durability: The build quality of these mirrors is impressive. They feel sturdy and well-made, capable of withstanding the elements and vibrations of the road. I'm confident they will last for years to come.5. Improved Aesthetics: Beyond their functional benefits, these mirrors have also enhanced the overall look of my car. They have a sleek and modern design that complements the vehicle's appearance.6. Affordable Upgrade: Considering the added safety and convenience they offer, the cost of these rearview mirrors is a small price to pay for peace of mind on the road.In conclusion, upgrading my car's rearview mirrors has been one of the best decisions I've made for my driving experience. I highly recommend investing in quality rearview mirrors if you haven't already. They are a small change that can make a big difference in your safety and driving confidence. These 5-star rearview mirrors have truly exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with the results.",

                "reviewText": "Love this mirror! Texas heat made my old one melt off so I had to replace. This was the best choice by far. I can see all my blind spots and backing in is a breeze. It\u2019s a bit odd at first but you get used to the new view. It\u2019s not as magnified as standard mirrors, even still I like it. I don\u2019t need to see the nose hairs on the guy in the car behind me. Super easy and quick install. So far I\u2019ve had it on (through 100+ temps) for a few weeks and it hasn\u2019t budged. I was in a rush so I just used the suction cup bit, no adhesive and it\u2019s doing great. Very sturdy. I will say that when you adjust it, it\u2019s kinda wobbly. Not bad, but it\u2019s got that loose \u2018about to fall\u2019 feeling. Again; it hasn\u2019t fallen off so we\u2019re golden. Can\u2019t go wrong with this one.",

And I really liked it.But unfortunately its not for me.Even though the Rearview mirror does a great job it hurts my eyes to look into it. I figure I'll wait a bit so my eyes can adjust to it. But after a couple days it still hurt my eyes.Another issue I have with it, is when I'm driving and people put on there high beams, it's blinding.But the biggest reason why I can't use it, is that it hurts my eyes.So even though it's a great item, it's not for me. And I'm returning it.",
