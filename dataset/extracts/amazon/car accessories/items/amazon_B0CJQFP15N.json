                "reviewText": "I have these in my Honda CRV hanging from the front seat headrests facing the back seat.What I like:- Super-easy to install. Fit the headrest posts with zero issues.- Seem strong. Note that the advertised \"metal core\" means that the hook and hanging post sections are metal, sewn into two pieces of leather--the center section between them is just leather. Not a criticism, just for information.- Attractive. These actually look nice. Not cheesy at all.- At $5 each, these are reasonably priced.What I don't like:- The section that wraps around the headrest post sits at an angle, especially when you have something hanging from the hooks, making them more noticeable. You can see it in the product pictures. Small deal, but would have been nice had these rested flush. If the metal in this section had been slightly concave, this could be remedied. I may try to bend these myself.- Not a huge deal, but these are shipped folded in half, resulting in a significant crease through the center of the leather area between the mounting and hanging sections. It feels like the crease will be permanent. It would have been better to ship these rolled-up instead of folded.Overall, these hooks do the job. They look nice and are reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "These hooks do as intended and are easy to slip onto the post of your headrest. The ones I received weren't packaged very thoughtfully though. They come folded up, which is fine. But they were folded the opposite way they're intended to be hung, creating an ugly crease in them now. I've tried to have some weight on the hook in the hopes it would straighten them out but so far no luck. They look kind of sloppy like this and I don't recommend these. There's better hooks out there.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I really like the look of this. For the price, I'm assuming it's vinyl and not leather, but I think it's high quality. The black \"leather\" seems to be fairly thick and the stitching looks good. I like that the hook that hooks onto the headrest has metal inside of the \"leather\" so it doesn't feel like it will fall apart. The black knob/hook where you hang your item (in my case, a travel umbrella) also came wrapped with plastic to protect its finish. Very satisfied with this product.",
