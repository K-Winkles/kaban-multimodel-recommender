Right now I'm hanging the smaller one from a purse hanger that is attached to the front passenger headrest. I'm using the larger one to store other things. I'll see how that goes. I would like to find some small black trash bags that would fit one or the other, but at least the inside can be wiped out. As others have mentioned, these don't really stand open unless there is already stuff in it. Glad to have them, though.",

They have a cloth exterior with a plastic coating on the inside. 2 sides are made of a stiff material, while the other two sides are much thinner and more flexible. It says in the description that the \u201ccar trash bin\u2018s top stays open (even sitting on the ground) that you can easily throw the car trash into it\u201d but I find the top closes making a little less convenient. If hanging the top stays open, but if sitting on the ground the top closes.Pros:\u2022 Good quality for the price\u2022 Has a inner lining (PEVA) that will not absorb moistureNeutrals:\u2022 I like the black, blends right into my Nissan\u2019s interior colorCons:\u2022 They have a slight odor, I am hoping that goes away\u2022 Tops do not stay wide open when sitting on the ground, see photoItem came well packaged and was undamaged. I will keep this review up to date if any new issues arise as time passes.",

                "reviewText": "The foldable car trash can is a practical solution for keeping your vehicle tidy. It's made from water-resistant PU Leather, which contributes to its longevity. The interior lining is PEVA, a material that doesn't absorb moisture, making it easy to clean with just wipes.The trash can boasts a large storage space of up to 3 gallons, which can be a double-edged sword. While it's great for storing kids' toys or tablets, it can be a bit too bulky for smaller vehicles like sedans or small SUVs. The adjustable strap is 18\" long, making it versatile for different car interiors.The reinforced front and back walls made from PP plastic board keep the can from collapsing, ensuring it retains its shape whether it's hanging on the headrest or placed on the floor. However, it's worth noting that the can may encroach on the passenger seating space when full.One of its unique features is the two clips on both sides for fastening a trash bag. This not only helps keep the can clean but also makes garbage disposal a breeze. The foldable design is a nice touch, making it portable for travel and camping.In conclusion, if you don't mind the size, this car trash can is a sturdy and convenient addition to your vehicle.",

                "reviewText": "This 3-gallon travel garbage bin is a great solution for family haulers work trucks, and even travel trailers. It is very easy to use and is compatible with most small kitchen garbage bags. The clips on every side of the bun are nice as they hold the side of the bag in place preventing any issue with it folding in. The strap to place it is very nice and easy to use, I also really like that it is adjustable making it versatile to the space you need it in. We are currently using this in our family hauler and it has made a world of difference. If my teens have snacks or we stop on the go for a bite to eat it makes cleaning up after a breeze. I also really like its size it is bigger but doesn't take up too much room and can be folded and stored away when not in use. This is leakproof, we did a test by pouring some water in the base to see what would happen. Not a drop spilled, and due to it being PU leather, it was very easy to wipe clean and back, making it a great addition that is easy to maintain. Help keep the garbage and clutter under control on the go.",
