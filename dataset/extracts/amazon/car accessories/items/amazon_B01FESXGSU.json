I\u2019ve hung everything from delicate sun hats to 15lb+ laptop bags and these are the ticket. They rotate easily when empty but stay in position when something is hung on it. Never swings around while I\u2019m driving. Low profile to the back of the seat - I can even hang things there while I have backseat passengers and it doesn\u2019t bother them. I\u2019m back again to buy more as presents for others, it\u2019s such a slam dunk product! Save yourself the time and stress - my purse hasn\u2019t dumped over in traffic in over five years and I can tell you \u2014 this is what success looks like. All the best!",

I normally keep my purse in the front seat when driving alone but when someone is with me, it\u2019s more convenient to hang it on these hooks rather than put in back seat or on the floor behind front seat where it is hard to reach. Also good for hanging grocery bags so contents don\u2019t spill out all over.",
