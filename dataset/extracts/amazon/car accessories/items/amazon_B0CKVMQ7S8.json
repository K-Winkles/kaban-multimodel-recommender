            "[Essential] Car scratch removal pen for removing coatings and repairing car scratches.It is a must-have for car enthusiasts and drivers. It will save you a lot of money to repair small scratches.",
            "[Instructions for Use] 1. Clean the scratch area before use. 2. Remove wax from the scratch area. 3. Remove rust. 4. Shake the pen about 10 to 40 times before use. 5. Before use, try using it on paper to confirm that the color matches the paint on your vehicle.",
            "[Easy to dry]It only takes about 10 minutes (at room temperature) to dry. When you finish the first layer, it will dry quickly. If the scratches are deep, you can apply the second and third layers until the scratches are completely filled. Save you a lot of time. Attention: Please use on sunny days.",
            "[Reminder] This type of pen cannot make the scratches disappear 100%, it can only make the scratches less obvious and prevent the car from rusting. After light polishing on the paint surface, the paint surface will become more shiny, and the color difference between the repaired area and the original car paint will be coordinated, making the repaired paint surface more natural.",
            "[Note] 1. Please do not touch directly with your skin. If you accidentally enter your eyes. Please wash your eyes with a large amount of water and immediately see a doctor. 3. Stay away from children and fires. 4. Keep upward after use. 5. Easy to dry, please tighten the pen cap after using the pen."

You can tell it\u2019s a cover up quick fix job but it\u2019s not trash. I used it to cover up highway chips on my Audi. The reality is that I covers up the appearance of flaws in the paint from a distance. You get within 5ft and you\u2019ll notice but otherwise it takes the spotlight off what would normally catch your eye as a distasteful blemish. It serves a purpose and can\u2019t beat it at the price point.",
