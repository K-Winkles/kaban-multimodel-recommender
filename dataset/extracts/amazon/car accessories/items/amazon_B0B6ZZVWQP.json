                "reviewText": "This product has truly transformed the way I store and access my sunglasses and eyeglasses while driving, providing convenience, security, and style all in one. I don't have a spot to store my sunglasses in my car so had been putting them in the console where they were getting all scratched up. This provides a way to keep them clean and secure with easy access!The design of the sunglass holder is both practical and aesthetically pleasing. The leather material adds a touch of sophistication to my car's interior, blending seamlessly with the overall look. The compact size and sleek design do not obstruct the sun visor or interfere with the driver's visibility, allowing for a safe and comfortable driving experience.A must-have accessory for anyone who wants convenient and secure storage for their sunglasses or eyeglasses while driving!",

It clamps tightly on my sun visor so no worries about it falling off. My sunglass fit's perfectly and the magnet is strong enough to clamp it tight. Highly recommended.",
