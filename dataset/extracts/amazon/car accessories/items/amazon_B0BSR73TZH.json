It\u2019s not sticky & it\u2019s fast absorbing. Plus, it comes in 15 uplifting scents! How long does it last & what are the benefits? Our mist contains 500+ sprays and is also packed with good-for-you ingredients that leave hands soft, hydrated, & smelling great. Are the containers refillable? Currently, our mists are not refillable due to the high risk of cross-contamination. However, we are working on a refillable option that eliminates the risk of cross-contamination. Can I bring this on a plane in my carry-on luggage? Each passenger on a flight may carry liquids, gels, and aerosols in travel-size containers that are 3.4 fl oz (100mL). We have created our product to not only be pocket-friendly but also TSA-friendly, with it being only 1.0 fl oz (30mL). Is it Vegan & Cruelty-free? What is the alcohol %? Does it contain any FDA banned ingredients? Our Power Mist formulation is vegan & cruelty-free. It contains 70% ethyl alcohol which eliminates 99.99% of most common germs and bacteria. Moreover, It does NOT include harmful ingredients such as Triclosan.",

The scents are fantastic and they leave my hands feeling moisturized in a way that I can't imagine living without now that I've tried the Touchland hand sanitizers! They're so small they'll fit in just about any purse. They are a staple in my bags from here on out! I got the Juicy 3-Pack and I've been thrilled with all the scents. None of them are overpowering, and they don't smell artificial at all. It's like you're smelling a real fruit! I don't know how they do it, but the scent is wonderfully realistic and long-lasting.I will definitely be purchasing it again!",
