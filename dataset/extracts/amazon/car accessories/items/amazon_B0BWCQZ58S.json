When they arrived, the aluminum covers were not even attached to pedal cover and fell out of packaging in 4 pieces. It also looked like they were bent at some point after being manufactured. Metal was so thin, there was no way to flatten it without a blemish and there was also no way to snap or mount it back onto cover. I wasted money on these and had to purchase a better set that was a one piece unit cover with rubber boot on the back of pedal cover. It was a fight, but I know it's as good as the ones that are put on Dodge Chargers. Definitely a donation, not a purchase! Expensive piece of trash!",
