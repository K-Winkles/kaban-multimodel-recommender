                "reviewText": "I\u2019m withholding 1 star due to the scents that are provided. They could use a little upgrading in that regard. Some smelled like those awful deodorizers in port-a-potties. I think 1-2 were \u201cok\u201d and \u201cpretty good\u201d. The others were horrible, but of course different people gravitate towards different scents. As I saw from a portion of other reviews, they shared in the same opinion.I wish there was a 1/2 star option because I would have rated this product a 4.5. For all intents and purposes, the 4 star rating is for the product itself which is unlike any vent scent diffuser I\u2019ve seen thus far. Even my car wash people asked me where I got it from, and a lot of their business clientele have high end cars. I drive a black Jaguar F Type R, and wanted something that didn\u2019t look cheesy or cheap. From what I can tell, these vent clips are made from metal or aluminum? Either one, they feel smooth and like \u201cquality\u201d. Fit perfectly in my Jag\u2019s slats. I chose black because I wanted it to blend in. I see there\u2019s also silver (or chrome) which would have also looked nice because of my silver accents, but personally, I like the color black in general, across the board.So if you\u2019re looking for a vent clip that\u2019s on the classier side, then I\u2019d say choose this one. Just be sure to order some extra scent sticks that you can use your own fragrances or oils with.",

                "reviewText": "I love the design and its concept, however; the air freshener scents provided with it are either terrible or for the very few of them that are tolerable seem to be very basic scents like lemon for example. As far as longevity, they don\u2019t last but maybe an hour because the heat coming out of the vent dries out the scent oil soaked cotton extremely fast then starts to smell like a cheap old aftershave scent. So, what I did was removed the wick from one of my favorite air wick plug in scent, and cut off about an inch off the wick to fit in to the scent capsule, and BAMB! I have my favorite scent in my car that seems to be lasting a lot longer. Keep in mind that the air wick cotton wick is the SAME EXACT THING used in the air freshener kit, and the best thing about it is that as soon as you remove the wick from the plug-in you just put the cap back on the oil filled bottle and use it to refresh the wick when it gets weak bringing it back to its full scented life.** Note: Just wear a pair of latex or similar gloves to prevent skin contact with the oils.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this diffuser looking for something to keep my car smelling good when I am driving. Diffuser is well made and sturdy. So far my only complaint is that the scent doesn't last very long. I am using in 2 different vehicles and they both lasted less than a week. If they lasted longer I would definitely give this a 5. I am going to try one of the other scents to see if they last longer. Honestly the price is unbeatable if the scents last longer if not you would be better off buying the old reliable tree car fresheners, they seem to last longer. I will update my review after trying a different scent in each car.",
