                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the RUBOT Handheld Vacuum Cleaner and while I was impressed with its stylish design and multifunctional accessories, I have to say that the suction power wasn't as strong as I had hoped.The vacuum cleaner has two-speed suction power up to 16000pa, but I found that it didn't fulfill my cleaning needs as well as I had expected. However, the quick charge and long runtime are still great features, with up to 30 minutes of high-efficiency cleaning after just 3-4 hours of charging.The compact size and stylish design make it a great addition to my cleaning routine, and the 3 in 1 multifunctional accessory effectively clean corners, stairs, and hard-to-reach places. The effective triple filter system is also a plus, with a large 120ml dust canister and washable filters.Overall, the RUBOT Handheld Vacuum Cleaner is a decent purchase for anyone looking for a compact and multifunctional cleaning tool. While the suction power isn't extreme, the quick charge, long runtime, stylish design, and effective filter system make it a good choice for light cleaning tasks. I would give it a four-star rating.",

That's what carwashes are for.But for those smaller messes in the car or anywhere, it is a nice little unit.And if the instructions are followed for charging, they battery has good life.The dust bin is small, but holds a lot, clean out is easy with the bin twist locking off and on, wash up of the filter is a breeze.Its well made, nice heavy duty feel, the motor winds up nice and smooth with no high frequency vibration, or harmonicsThe dust blower attachment works great for dusing around electronics, keyboards,I recommend this for light cleaning in the bed/bath, computer room, work bench, and yes the car.Love it, love itAnd lastly, I almost didn't buy it because of the negative reviews! SHAME, SHAMFUL.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to use around the house, outside patio, and my car's interior. I wanted a cordless vac with decent suction, good running time, and easy charging. I read reviews for several and decided on this one because it had the highest suction but was also the most expensive of the ones considered. After getting it and using it several times, it does pick up debris including bits of gravel, pet hair, etc. well. The attachments are very appropriate for different functions, and emptying the collection container is easy with the push of a button. It says it can run about 30 minutes before a charge is required. I've only had to charge it 3 times so far but, for my use, I charged it after about 20 minutes because the suction was noticeably less. I wish the debris storage area was larger but it's very easy to empty. It's easy to hold and operate and easy to store. Overall, I'm happy with the vacuum's performance, the accessories, and convenience. I would recommend this.",

Tried to pick up some pine needles christmas morning it picked up one out of every 5 or so. This thing is loud. My regular vacuum is just as loud maybe even quieter then this. Trying to vacuum up little tid bits in a car is defying. The only thing that works good is the opposite end of this thing it blows air and that's pretty strong. I guess if your looking to replace a can of compressed air maybe this would work. But as a vacuum it's horrible.",

I like to keep my car clean, that means washing it often and even keeping many microfiber cloths to wipe down the interior from time to time. So naturally I had to get a portable vacuum. I didn't like other designs that were kinda bulky, so when I saw this sleeker designed one, it caught my interest. The build quality is actually quite good for the price range and the suction is just about what you'd expect from something this size. Keep in mind it won't suck up anything crazy, just minor crumbs and things like that in your car, which is perfect for my applications. Overall this vacuum is sleek, good looking, and just enough suction to work in my situation.",
