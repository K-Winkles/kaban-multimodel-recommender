                "reviewText": "I bought the HOTOR 3-gallon car trash can. FIRST, I'll tell you that the trash can is great and even better than I'd hoped. It will definitely do the job I want it to do, and it will be very easy to maintain since the removeable bags will keep it clean. It's large enough to also serve another function very specific to our needs that is totally different from that of a trash can. Let me explain. My wife has had MS since May 1975 and is now confined to a power chair. We had an Acura MDX with a lift for her chair, but we had to trade it for a van that has ramp she can drive her chair into and then anchor it into a locking system in the passenger side. It's when she's not with me that I realized there was a problem. I had pulled into a fast-food restaurant and ordered food to take home. So far so good. The problem? When they handed me the bag of food, I turned to put them in the passenger seat, and ... then realized that there was none! I drove home carefully, but the bag skidded all over the van from front to back and side to side! You see, there's no carpet since the power chair would tear it up. The floor is a durable, smooth surface and works well for the chair and works well if your food wants to leave sandwiches and French fries all over the van! Back to the trash can. After getting it, I found that, with the top opened, the can works perfectly well as a place to put beside the driver's seat and a fast-food bag fits in it quite nicely. I keep clean bags in it thanks to Lily in Customer Service. That (finally, right) brings me to the SECOND thing and the best thing about my purchase. Folks, the customer service I've received has been nothing except fantastic! What did I contact Customer Service you ask? Not any problem with the garbage can. It's great. My issue was that I bought the 3-gallon can and I wanted to buy a supply of HOTOR 3-gallon bags for it. All I could find was links to buy their 2-gallon bags. So, I had the great experience of contacting Lily in HOTOR Customer Service asking for help. Ladies and gentlemen, she has been extraordinary to say the least! First, she told me that she was just going to send me 50 replacement bags that fit my 3-gallon can ... for free. And she did. Then she sent me a link to use for getting more bags. It was then that she told me that their 2-gallon bags also fit the 3-gallon can! They're big enough. I suggested to Lily that she might pass along my suggestion to those who do their Internet marketing that they mention on their 3-gallon can links that you can use the bags advertised as 2-gallon bags. She thought that was a good idea. I hope someone else thinks so too. Suffice it to say that I've had 14 emails back and forth with Lily and each time she has been helping me with suggestions, soliciting feedback from me, or asking for suggestions how to make their product better, etc. No matter what time of night (e.g., even 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM) I'd email her I'd get a reply almost immediately. The woman never sleeps! She has promised to help me whenever I might need something in the future no matter what it is. So, to summarize, the trash can is terrific, the bags are great and the magnets to hold them in are very nice, BUT the Customer Service is actually unbelievable! Although I don't see a problem you'll have with their products, even if you do have a problem or a question, you'll never have one that Lily won't solve for you ... no matter what time of day (or night) it might be!",

                "reviewText": "After years of just dropping a used shopping bag in the back to use as a rubbish bin, fishing around without looking trying to drop a rapper or Kleenex into it and only mostly succeeding, I decided to spring for something more grown up.This has worked perfectly. It fits right behind the console of our small crossover. The console lid which opens so I just ran the straps under it, making sure it didn't get pinched in the hinges and pulled it as snuggly as possible.If you are going to need to use the middle seat of the back row, you'll need to remove it and place it elsewhere. But we seat at most four and so it doesn't need to be at anyone's feet.The top with the slits that give way as you drop trash in is nice as you don't have to lift anything and it's easy to ensure trash is in the bin while preventing it from bouncing out from an ill-aimed throw or whatever. I haven't bought the official replacement liners yet though I'm considering it. The bin came with two. I suspect we can go back to using the used shopping bags as liners when these two are full. But we'll see when the time comes. The ones that come with it are just the right size and thickness to be pinned perfectly by the magnetic clips on the inside designed to hold them in.The bin comes with two plastic braces (and two replacements) that you slide into sleeves on the side to keep the bin square at the top. Do know that you will have to apply quite a bit of force to get them bent and into the sleeves. So much so that I feared I was going to snap them. I didn't, thankfully, but the possibility, I assume, is why they include the extras.So far, very happy with it. Would highly recommend!",

After several months this trashcan does its job and is very convenient for those who wish to maintain a clean car. I don't have kids but I purchased one for a friend who does and she found it to be amazing. I have no idea how leak/waterproof this item is as I have yet to put any kind of liquid in it. The item comes with 2 trashbags made for the item and you can easily purchase any small-size trash bags (Base it off the gallon size of the item) and they will do the trick. The only complaint I have about this item was that I was expecting it to be a more sturdy-box-like item but when it arrived I discovered that it's basically an inexpensive lunch box that's deflated. However, this concern is no longer a problem for me as once you set it up the shape holds and it is able to hold plenty of trash.",

And cute too!There\u2019s little snaps inside that hold a trash bag in place which is a nice touch. There\u2019s little plastic inserts to help keep the form of the product right. I like hanging it on my front seat so it\u2019s easily accessible, but that does mean I have to move it every time someone sits in the front seat. It doesn\u2019t do too well free standing.",
