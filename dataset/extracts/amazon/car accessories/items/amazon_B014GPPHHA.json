I\u2019ve used this to dust my house, including windows, mirrors, TV, TV stands, bookshelves, nightstands, dresser drawers, pretty much almost everything. I didn\u2019t have to clean the duster and I didn\u2019t noticed any dust left behind. I even use this to dust in my car and I actually keep one in the car. The quality is holding up very well and I can see this lasting for a very long time. They just need to make a slimmer and flexible duster to get into the tight crevices and grooves. This is still perfect and I highly recommend it",

It picks up all the heavy dust, you can also dampen it to clean. What I really liked about the product was the fact that it could be washed versus having to buy refillable pieces to clean dust. I am very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This duster is conveniently sized and well made with a solid handle and plenty of surface area to pick up dust. The microfiber bristles work quite well picking up dust and small crumbs on the seats, center console, steering column, and front panel of the dashboard. However, when I tried using it on the top of the dashboard where most of the dust collects, so much static built up between the fibers and the dashboard that the duster left more little fibers on the dash than it picked up dust. The black dash looked considerably worse than when I first started and the fibers clinged so tightly to the dashboard that I had to use a wipe to get them off. I should add that I have a fairly new car so I don't know if this problem will get better with time but for now I am only using the duster on the seats, center console, steering column, and front panel of the dashboard.",
