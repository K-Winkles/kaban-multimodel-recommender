                "reviewText": "Okay, I purchased these to soak up moisture from drinks or to catch drips hoping to not get the molded plastic wet to where it builds up dirt as quick. They do what they do and they are what they are. The material is not too thin, the color is true to advertised. Basically, I got what I paid for so I am happy.I paired them with the cute coasters pictured. Not sure if I believe there is a benefit to the coasters but, they are cute! I am hoping between have a drip pan, these, and the coasters that the coasters will help to soak up some moisture if needed.I tried these in three different vehicles. Don\u2019t judge the dirt, we are a family always on the go from one sports event to the next, and it\u2019s winter. I hate the cold! I\u2019ll take the dirt over being out in the cold to clean the car. Anyway, in cup holders that are a little larger / hold Stanley, they have a little wiggle room. In smaller cup holders that firmly hold a classic tumbler more firmly they fit snug. In a Jeep and GMC I had wiggle room. The other vehicle had different sized cup holders so the results were mixed. If your vehicle comes pre-equipped with rubber liners then, you don\u2019t need these unless you just want some color. I will say in the one with a liner already available, I have to take the liner out to fit wide bottom containers. However, I can use these in their place in those instances.In cases where they are a snugger fit you may have to get something to separate the pull tab from the plastic to pull them out as it clings. Although having tabs makes removal super easy!I love that i can take these out and easily wash them. That is the biggest perk in my book! I do think if I buy them again that I would get the black to match my car's interior. Seeing they don't fit snug in all of the cup holders, I think I would like them to blend in more.",
