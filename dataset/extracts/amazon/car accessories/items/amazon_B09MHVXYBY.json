If you use a phone holder that clips on the vent then you have to skip that part of the vent or you won't get the phone holder on the vent. We had just enough to do our entire trucks vents with one strip left over. These are so thick that you can't even put an air freshener on them either. They did however make the truck look nice! I don't think I would buy this product again considering the time it took to install them and all the struggle I went through to put them on. Maybe they should make them a little thinner so they can bend a little better into place.",

                "reviewText": "Now let me first say I wasn\u2019t expecting these to look make my car look like the inside of a Bentley or anything but I also wasn\u2019t really grasping that these would be a vivid royal blue metallic thing with prismatic reflective patterns. I expected color, and little accenting of the interior but to me these just scream Hormonal Alabama Teen Male, aka tacky. I also found them to be a bit frustrating / annoying to put in the vent slats. You have to kinda pry them apart but they get stuck from the rubber edging and wrap up inside themselves and as a dude with biggish hands and apparently hotdog fingers it was too hard to mimic microsurgical skills for me. In the end I put them on every other slat and though to me they still scream and far to loud \u201cSet phasers to STUNNING!\u201d rather than just make a nice accent to the car interior. They\u2019re okay and for some three might be total cool, I was just expecting a little bit more \u2018less is more\u2019. But for under ten bucks I\u2019ll forgo the ritual self-punishments and write this off as a so-so experiment in what it must be like to be a tiny elf with teeny hands that can bake cookies for Keebler and then do shiny blue microsurgery with a cherubic bliss after hours.I give them a \u201cMeh\u201d.",

So when cutting and putting on first thing I noticed is that in crinkle and if u bend it the color sticker starts to peel off. Also with running your heat that also tends to make it crinkle and peel. Over all I guess they are ok as long as u don't maneuver them to much or run your heat all the time. And the red is a very shiny red so if you don't want shiny don't order.",

                "reviewText": "These are a little tedious to install, for a couple reasons.One, they're very tight, and the sides don't separate easily. What I found worked best is splitting them with a wide-blade screwdriver, and opening one end a bit more, placing it on one end, then sliding a finger across the rest, forcing it to open around the vent.The second small issue is that it's almost impossible to cut them the same length, as they require some amount of scissor pressure, and when the cut is made, moves the blades, slightly.Anyway, they look good, right now, but who knows how long they'll last, with season temperature changes, and hot or cold air moving over them all the time.Up side, is they're cheap, so easily replaced.I like them, though, and recommend.",
