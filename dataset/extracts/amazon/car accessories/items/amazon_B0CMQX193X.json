I\u2019ve had mine hanging in my closet for well over three weeks now and the scent is still going strong. I will definitely be trying the other scents.",

The scent is strong, but not overpowering, and it is long lasting (I've had it in for almost three weeks now and it still smells. It would be better if the ribbon was elastic because it's hard to tie around your review mirror because of the short length, which also puts it too close to the glass. I'm not sure if the ceramic is hard enough to crack my windshield, but it's not a reassuring sound when they hit. I think it would work better in a drawer or office, where it isn't at risk of hitting glass.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really cool air freshener! It's made of ceramic and it comes with a ribbon to use for hanging if you need it - you can place it virtually anywhere and the clean linen scent is powerful and amazing. I ordered this to hang in my car (I hang it from the gear shifter on steering column) and it's so much better than the little fragrance trees or the scentsy versions. You could also place the ceramic in a small space (ie: on a shelf), you can place inside of a clothing drawer, under cabinets, pretty much anywhere that you need a little scent boost! The fragrance is long lasting and gentle - it's not too overpowering, and I'm impressed with how much better the ceramic is than the other fragrance products containing oil. This does not have any oil and there's no need to fill it...you remove it from the box, attach the ribbon if you want to, and it's ready to go as the ceramic is already scented! Definitely a great product at a really great price point given how long it lasts. I will absolutely be purchasing these for my car from now on!",

Instead, this vanilla is more grown-up and beautiful. It feels like a luxurious, rich clean scent. I was planning to put this in my car, but I hung it up by my desk in the meantime, and I love the smell so much that I think I\u2019ll keep it at my desk so I can smell it all day. I honestly wish I had a perfume in this scent! The ceramic piece is also really beautiful, and once the smell dissipates I plan to add some essential oils or perfume oils to it to continue using it as an air freshener.",

                "reviewText": "The Airkeep Air Freshner works wonderfully in our bedroom. I put it on the closet doorknob, and it really does a great job of getting rid of the doggy odor in our room. Our dog loves to stay in our bedroom most of the day, and when it's humid outside or she's been in the rain, her scent is less than desirable. I hate to use deodorizing air sprays due to all the chemicals they emit, and this was a much better option. I originally ordered this for our car, but the scent is rather strong for such a small area. I really do like the scent, but I think the bedroom, or for use in a walk-in closet, would be a better place to hang this ornate ceramic. It gives a very outdoorsy, clean scent wherever you want to freshen an area.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very pretty ceramic scent distributor. I adore the little flowers that they put on the ceramic. It's in an aluminum foil type pack to keep the scent sealed until you're ready to use it. My issue with this is... I really don't like the scent. It's so strong which is great if the scent was nice but it is not. I smell all the cashmere but none of the vanilla. I think if the vanilla was more prominent then it would actually smell really nice. The product itself is awesome and does exactly what it says and the only issue I have is a personal preference issue so I won't dock more than 1 star. Personally, I just don't think I'll be able to use it which is unfortunate because it's a gorgeous piece.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a neat and pretty idea for an air freshener. It comes sealed up inside the box so none of the fragrance escapes or is able to dry out before you can use it. It also comes with a string that you loop through the top of the ceramic piece and it will hang where you would like it to go. I put this one in my car. The smell was really nice. I put it in overnight and when I checked it today it is not overpowering, but it makes the whole car smell very fresh. The ceramic is also not wet so it doesn\u2019t really leave marks anywhere or oily residue anywhere.",
