                "reviewText": "First off, I did not end up using the clips. I mainly have the trunk down because I am a fur-mom x2 (no 2 legged children); except for the neighborhood kids I take to church on Wednesday and Sunday, then the seats are back up in the sitting position.Back to the clips! Seeing as I have the seats down and pups in the back (American Staffordshire Terrier and Blue nose pit) I didn't want them walking on them, so they don't hurt the paws or snag on the felt interior. Also, the last picture I put a trunk cover down and didn't want that torn.For the non-dog car rider people these clips go at the end of the elastic and it was tough for me to pull the elastic under the crevice of the seat and trunk then stretch and clip. One end is the loop the other is like a tighter L-shape and I would use pliers and close them into each other to fasten more securely. The clips work but not sure how long it will stay and not pup moving the seat from up to down position. Therefore, I secured mine with zip ties! They seem to fix it all just like electrical tape! j/k. The zip ties wont hurt the pups paws; I could give it more slack in the stretch attachments that come on the seat covers and it doesn't feel so tight that it is gonna rip them.To be honest; that was my hardest part. Getting the backseat part on and then making sure they were nice and snug around the back part. Oh, and the front seats have a velcro snap to secure under the seat. Have to go under both sides of seats and feed them through the seat adjuster then velcro it.The part about removing the headrest and cutting small holes to fit the headrest back over and also cut holes for the seatbelt snaps was easy. For the head rest cut a small pinch out about the size of a dime and that is perfect to fit it nicely. The seat belts about the size of a quarter and you can wiggle them through and if it gets too tough just cut a tad bit more and they fit nice.My front seats look a little baggy in the picture because I have arm rest on my seats. I am going to got back and do the same like the headrest. I will remove the arm rest; pull the car seat cover into place taunt and then cut a small hole and put the arm rest back on. I was just getting tired and the rain was coming. Otherwise you could just cut a vertical line long enough to slip around the arm rest bar and down to the bottom of seat but that could be a lot of material cut versus a small size dime hole like the headrest.I also purchased the product for less than the NEW price. I picked the like new for about $13 dollars and they look brand new? I don't know if it was because the box appeared opened then taped back but mine look brand new and had no cuts or tears in them. What a deal!Item arrived quickly packaged nicely with no damage. Again, budget friendly for my fixed income disability budget. Seats are protected from dog hair and a quick spill of a drink if it happens. Got them in my favorite color too! Very pleased; would order again.",

The front seat cover were the easiest to install and required no cutting of material. The back seat were the hardest to install and I don\u2019t think I did too bad on them. I could only tuck in the material of the bottom cover, but was able to hook the top part to at least give it the presence of a good fit. Cutting the fabric was simple and I didn\u2019t need to cut much, just enough for the seat belt buckles to fit. I bought these just to protect my leather seats in my Ford Fiesta since they still look like new.",

Unfortunately it didn\u2019t fit because the encore has an arm rest for the driver seat. If I put it up, it fit, but my son likes the arm rest. So I had to return these.

Thought it was my error so I came to watch video and it is not\u2026 I also ordered solid black and receive the black and grey one. I do not care enough to return them..just annoying. I did. It get what I ordered. They also feel very cheap compared to other car seat covers I\u2019ve had for the same price. Again do not care enough to bother with a return will just get new ones Jan future just not these.Also has a glitter look to them ? That is not mentioned any where ???",

M\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 un lave-auto, nettoy\u00e9 les bancs en profondeur, on voit encore des cernes de caf\u00e9, de la sauce BigMac et des traces de jus rouge? Vous \u00eates g\u00ean\u00e9s quand des invit\u00e9s s'assoient dans votre v\u00e9hicule? Cet ensemble de housses est une solution \u00e0 prix modique. Vous aurez s\u00fbrement un tour de rein apr\u00e8s avoir install\u00e9 la housse du banc arri\u00e8re, mais les vestiges crasseux de vos enfants auront disparus! Attention, elle est facile \u00e0 d\u00e9chirer lors de l'installation. Ne tirez pas trop fort sur les \u00e9lastiques. Si \u00e7a ne se rend pas o\u00f9 vous voulez, recommencez, mais ne tirez pas! Sinon vous aurez une d\u00e9chirure... :( La housse ne se d\u00e9chire pas quand elle est bien install\u00e9e. En plus, elle est lavable! Si fiston \u00e9chappe encore son lait au chocolat, pas de panique. On enl\u00e8ve tout, on met \u00e7a dans la laveuse et le tour est jou\u00e9. Pour le prix, c'est correct.",
