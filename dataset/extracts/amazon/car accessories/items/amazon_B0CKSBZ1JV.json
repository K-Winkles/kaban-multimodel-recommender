            "\u3010Anti Slip\u3011: When you find yourself in a rainstorm or snowstorm, the soles of your shoes are prone to slipping due to moisture. These non-slip pedals increase the coefficient of friction between your sole and the pedal, ensuring safe driving. They provide effective support for your feet and enhance your overall driving experience, resulting in a safer and more enjoyable journey.",
            "\u3010Fashionable Style\u3011: This car pedal mat is both practical and an excellent decorative item. The aluminum auto manual transmission brake pad cover, featuring a cool metal sports style, serves as the perfect accessory for enhancing your car's interior decor. By using it, your car will not only gain a personalized look but also exude a sporty and fashionable style.",
            "\u3010High Quality Material\u3011: The car pedal pad is crafted from durable aluminum alloy and high-quality ABS material. It expands the contact area of the pedals, making it easier for you to maneuver them. The anti-slip plastic surface can prevent rust and durability, prevent fracture and deformation, and effectively protect the accelerator pedal.",
            "\u3010Easy to Install\u3011: Installing car pedals is a straightforward process. First, ensure you clean the original pedals. Then, place the screws on the pedal cover without tightening them. Next, attach the pedal cover to the original pedal surface, securing the screw clips on the back. Finally, use a screwdriver to tighten the screws on the pedal cover surface.",
            "\u3010Widely Application\u3011: The manual transmission pedal measures 3.5 \u00d7 2.76 inches, 5.98 \u00d73.19 inches. The automatic transmission pedal measures 5.12 \u00d7 3.46 inches, 5.98 \u00d73.19 inches. These covers offer universal fitment for most vehicles. Please check your car's type and pedal sizes before purchasing to ensure a problem-free installation."

The mounting brackets are loose and there's no way to keep them secure even with thread locker. I made the mistake of buying these and it's not even worth my time returning them. I'm throwing them straight to the garage so they don't end up on another persons vehicle. Amazon your really starting to disappoint me with your quality control. Anyone who is reading this please buy reputable brands and stay away from these cheap knock offs.",
