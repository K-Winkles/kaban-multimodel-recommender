                "reviewText": "I've had this kit installed on my car for a few months now and it's fair to say that it's working very well. Getting the installation right is the most tedious part, eventually I went with hot glue and zip ties through drilled holes. After getting the lights mounted and the wires in a safe secure orientation, it's time to find power for the lights. I went with a 12v switch that goes to the interior for activation, that's spliced to the battery of the vehicle directly via the terminals- just red and black. The lights are very bright and for sure call attention, especially with the rainbow animation! way better than fading or solid colors you see with the cheaper kits in my opinion. Before hot gluing and drilling holes for zip ties, I had just relied on the double-sided tape included on the lights but after it shifted from warm to cold where I live they began drooping and eventually, I had a wire snag and kill the lights. I still had them affixed to the vehicle so it was just a matter of resplicing the cables together and sealing things up but it goes to show the importance of securing the lights and the cables- go overkill!",

I told my sister that if my scissors can just rip it then I know I wasn\u2019t trippin\u2026 I kid you not my scissors just slide through it like I was ripping up some flimsy paper\u2026 I only did this cause I just already knew this was a L that I had to take though. I\u2019m highly disappointed cause I just expected more\u2026 idk what exactly I expected fr but this just definitely wasn\u2019t what I expected!! I won\u2019t tell y\u2019all not to buy cause I ain\u2019t no hater but I definitely had to share my experience with this product cause\u2026 I\u2019m just at a lost for words atp\u2026 God Bless y\u2019all though \ud83e\udd70",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So they look nice and seems to have a strong double sided 3m tape, however my big issue is that the only way to control the lights is through an app. Other lights have control on either the lights itself (a small rectangular box that the lights are attached too) or/and they include a remote, either priced the same or for a few bucks more. For this reason I recommend buying different interior led lights.My complaint may not seem like a big deal but sometimes the light are unresponsive for a min when I am trying to control it by simply changing colors through the app. I'll rate this a 3 for the lack of control and If I didn't already install it, I would have returned it.",
