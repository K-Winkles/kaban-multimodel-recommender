                "reviewText": "This was super easy to install and will prevent a lot of issues I have experienced in the past. I once dropped my car keys upon arriving at my destination and they were impossible to retrieve after falling into that crevice. I literally spent almost an hour frantically trying to find them and put out my back doing the contortion required to get my arm under there. Another time, I was in the passenger side applying eyeliner on the way to our destination. To this day, my overpriced Stila pencil has yet to be recovered. \ud83d\ude43 I am looking forward to not encountering those types of issues again.That said\u2026I mount my phone to the left of the steering wheel and am more prone to losing my phone on the side closest to the door. This didn\u2019t even occur to me until after installing this product. This is obviously not the fault of the product, but now I need to find some way to either mount my phone on the right side (very hard the way my 2014 2.5i Subaru Outback interior is designed) and/or jerry rig some solution to block that area to the left of the seat.This product will still greatly reduce some issues I have experienced. It also came with some nice bonuses - a little credit card sized flashlight and a little washable sticky mat to hold items in place. It can keep my phone in place in other locations like the top of my center console or the small space in front of my clock, but no placement of this item will allow any visibility of the GPS, simply because of the interior design of my car. Again, not the product\u2019s fault.I don\u2019t regret buying this, but I also wish I had considered that it won\u2019t help prevent a big issue I was hoping to solve. Had I fully thought things through, I may have tried harder to find some alternative GPS solution first. I hate the vent clip holder I currently have, but thus far it has been the only \u201cgood\u201d option.",

                "reviewText": "There is a long distance from my home to my company, I usually drive for work and business travel. So I like to look through Amazon to find some car accessories which would make my driving process more convenient and comfortable. This time I purchased the Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler and YRU Car Phone Holder and both of them really enhanced my driving experience.The Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler was used to resolve the issue with phones, keys and other items falling into areas that are difficult to reach between the front seats and console and I'm extremely pleased with the effect. Since I purchased the YRU Car Phone Holder, I habitually put my phone in the phone holder when I get in the car, it literally has saved me hundreds of times from dropping my employee card, keys,or any item falling off underneath the seat.When it comes to the YRU Leather Panel Car Phone Holder, I have to say it's an accessory that helps me drive safer, this little mountable phone holder for the car is so easy to install and dependable, I just took a few minutes to attach the holder which has a very powerful suction to the dashboard of my car. The cell phone is at a good height and the long arm of the holder is just the perfect distance for me to reach my phone without looking down. For the hundreds of times I have put my phone in and taken it out it has never loosened. It is easy to squeeze the side arms to set the phone then squeeze again to release it. I can easily tilt it up, down, to the right or left to place it so I can see and hear my GPS system or speak hands free and avoid to pull my eyes far away from the road to make me drive safer. I feel safer with my phone in such a secure holder, I would definitely recommend this product!About Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler, Each package comes with 2 Drop Stops (1 for the driver side and 1 for the passenger side; universal fit). You also get two bonus gifts; a Slide Free Pad and an LED Credit Card Light. The sellers are very generous and the bonus gifts are very practical.When I eat something in my car it is difficult to avoid some food falling down in the gap between the front seats and console that I couldn't reach, I couldn't reach it with the vacuum, and it was just a mess. Since getting the Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler, I don't have such distress anymore! Not to mention, when I drop my phone, bottle lids, Air pod, etc. down the crack between the seat and armrest and can't reach it, now everything just lands on this gap filler and is easy to pick up.In addition to avoiding the hassle of dropping something under your seat, there is a safety factor here - avoiding bending my head to look for something that fell while driving. I like the YRU phone holder also because of the safety factor, with the phone holder, I\u2019ve been able to put my phone very close to my line of sight and avoid taking my eyes off the road while driving.I highly recommend the Drop Stop Car Seat Gap Filler and YRU Car Phone Holder. Sometimes, a small investment can make driving safer and more comfortable.",

You can\u2019t beat the quality of the materials, (no odor) I know this will last a long time. Installation was simple and the fact that it attaches \u201caround\u201d the seat belt clip is what makes it better than the rest. No problems moving seat, product stays in place. Save yourself the hassle and aggravation get this one right away. You won\u2019t regret it!",

And then the next time you go to Amazon there\u2019s 15 car products because they know you\u2019re looking at something about a car. Well, these came up and I have always wanted to buy these But I either forget about it or I\u2019m too lazy to look it up. They are fabulous they fit they were a little big for my car. I have a Kia Soul but I just pulled the seat to the side and stuck it in there and it\u2019s tight but it\u2019s in there and they\u2019re nice and they\u2019re well-made and I don\u2019t have to lose my phone down in that crack anymore! so they are definitely worth buying!Plus I got a few other goodies in the box as well so be surprised!",
