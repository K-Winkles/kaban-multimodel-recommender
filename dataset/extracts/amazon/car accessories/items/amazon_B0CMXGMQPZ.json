                "reviewText": "We got a smaller car to save on gas and I find it annoying how cluttered and small it feels with just a few things in it. The Cooper is a tiny, SUV style car, but it still feels so small to me after driving a full-size SUV for years. I always keep a car care kit, jack, some shopping bags, a first aid kit, roadside stuff, a few bottles of water, a towel; I like to be prepared, lol.This organizer fits perfectly in the back of the Mini Cooper and doesn't slide around. It has enough space in the sections that I can organize everything that I keep in the car for a 'just in case' scenario', as well as a few daily/weekly use items. I also have enough space to put my groceries, as long as it's a small load. I can store everything here and keep the glove compartment and tiny middle console, as well as the seats and floorboards clean and clear of clutter.This folds closed and it actually stays closed, which the one in my SUV doesn't do. This folds down compactly to fit into smaller spaces, or to carry this specifically for grocery shopping. If you're using a self-checkout, a self-can and pay app, or if you shop in a big box store that doesn't hand out bags, this will fit just fine into a buggy's bottom to be filled and then transferred into a vehicle after you're done shopping.So, it has plenty of uses. I feel like the quality is very good. The fabric is thick and feels like coated canvas to me. Maybe not entirely waterproof, but I think it is a rugged style of fabric. I think the price is justified for the quality and the versatility of this. I'm considering a second one just for groceries, since this is a smaller size and will be easy enough for me to lift from a buggy and into the car.",

It held a good deal of stuff and definitely did not slide all over the trunk of my car. I love the design of the exterior of the organizer. It looks more high end and the way it folds up is handy, with a small elastic loop fitting over a knob on each end. I am actually considering getting additional units, one more for me and then some for family members. They are well-made and quite solid. No more milk cartons rolling around my trunk! YAY!",

                "reviewText": "I was a little bit confused when I first opened the product because I realized that it was only a two storage trunk organizer. The reason why I was a little confused is because in the advertising of the product, it states that it is a three compartment organizer, and from the pictures looking far, it does sort of give off that three storage Vibe. The trunk organizer only comes with two square pockets, organizers, and an outer pocket that is more of a pouch. The seller is using the outer compartment (pouch) To advertise it as a three compartment, trunk organizer. Please be mindful that it does not have three different sections, but only two sections any little pouch on the outside that is counted as the third one. It also has two other mesh pouches towards the front of the trunk organizer, allowing you to put even more onto your trunk organizer.The only thing that I would say is missing from this project is some kind of fellow so that we can make sure it attaches to your trunk and is not move around side to side when you are driving other than that, this is a beautiful product and I absolutely love how compact it is. I don\u2019t mind the two sections at all.",

                "reviewText": "One of the photos for the listing says this expands to 3 sections, but it's really just two, plus a large pocket and side pockets. So far, the little bit of velcro on the bottom seems to be working to keep this in place well enough, but I'm not sure how it would work if it was full of heavier stuff. For now, I have a tire inflator and jumper cables on one side, and I'll probably be putting grocery totes on the other. The black matches the carpet in my trunk, so it looks like it belongs. Much better than the milk crate I had been using for the cables and other car stuff. I wouldn't mind having a second one to put full grocery bags to keep them stable while I drive.",

                "reviewText": "I am using the medium size organizer to divide my Chevy Bolt EUV luggage area into thirds as shown in the attached photos. The EUV is a sub-compact hatchback. The organizer provides two bins plus some small pockets in the middle third and creates areas on each side to keep thinks from sliding and toppling in those areas. The small patches of Velcro hooks on the bottom seem to provide enough grip to do the job. The organizer is flexible enough to take on a bit of an angle to conform to the angle of the back of the back seats.",
