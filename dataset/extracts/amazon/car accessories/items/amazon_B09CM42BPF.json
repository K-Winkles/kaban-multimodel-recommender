                "reviewText": "The JUSTTOP Car Trash Can is an essential accessory for anyone looking to keep their car cabin neat and tidy. This small, automatic, and portable trash can with its elegant diamond design not only serves its purpose but also adds a touch of style to the car\u2019s interior.What I found most beneficial about this trash can is its convenience and utility. It\u2019s the perfect size for a car, easily fitting in a variety of spaces without taking up too much room. The automatic lid is a smart feature, making it effortless to dispose of trash, especially while driving. This design ensures that the cabin remains clean and free from small litter that can often accumulate during journeys.The ease of cleaning this trash can is another plus. It\u2019s simple to maintain and keeps looking as good as new with minimal effort. Additionally, its versatility extends beyond the car \u2013 it\u2019s suitable for use in the home or office too, making it a multipurpose item.The black color and diamond design give it a premium look, which is a nice departure from the usual bland car accessories. It blends well with the car\u2019s interior, and the lid ensures that the trash is out of sight, helping maintain an overall neat appearance.",

They have held up great, spring mechanism did come apart once, but it was so easy to put it back together. No issues, would 10 out of 10 buy again if I lose any.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this back in 11/22 and the spring assembly on the lid kicked the bed today. But it was $8 and it\u2019s honestly a great little contraption. I\u2019m happily buying a replacement. The can fits perfectly in the driver-side door of my 2017 Subaru Impreza Hatchback. I prefer it there in lieu of the cup holder from a look standpoint. I like for my car to be clutter free and this blends right in with the door. The receptacle fills up quick if you\u2019re throwing out fast food receipts, sticky notes, etc. but this holds a ton of straw wrappers.For $8 it\u2019s a very fair deal. Yes, it\u2019s rather cheaply made, but there really shouldn\u2019t be a whole lot of rough and tumble with it anyways. It should just sit in the cup holder/preferred spot, and it\u2019ll be fine. I plan to repurpose the broken one as a \u201cpenny jar\u201d in the cupboard. I just wanted one with a working lid for the car.It\u2019s silly to like a garbage can for cars so much, but it really does encourage me to keep my car clean, and it\u2019s nice to have on long haul car rides.",

                "reviewText": "I like that these are not huge, they stand upright, and have lids that automatically close due to a spring. My biggest issue is that the lids do not stay on very well (they pop off so easily) and sometimes if they fall off from my center console and hit the car floor at a weird angle, the spring pin comes out and I have to put the whole thing back together. It\u2019s not a huge deal, but it\u2019s annoying and just needs to be a little sturdier.I also wish they came in different sizes because these are just too big for the lower \u201cpocket\u201d in my car doors.",
