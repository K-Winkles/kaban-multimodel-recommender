There's limited clearance around my outlet, so having something small that sits almost flush was ideal. The blue LED light is kind of pathetic, but at least it's not glaringly bright. That would be much worse at night. I'm glad I got the 2 pack because now I can leave the extra one plugged into my rear row in case anyone who rides in my car needs a quick charge. These charge just as fast as my previous 30w Anker charger while taking up significantly less space.",

The unit provides 1 USB A port with QC3.0 and 1 USB C port which provides PD charging. My Galaxy S22 Ultra charges in fast charge mode on the USB A port and super fast charging on the USB C PD port. As pointed out, the unit is small and takes up minimal space. However, if you have a socket that is recessed or has plastic around it, you will have a problem gripping it to remove it. I had to insert a USB cord into the A socket and rotate while pulling to remove it.Overall I'd buy these again. I recommend getting these for the price. With that said, I hope the price doesn't reflect the quality of the electronics and/or longevity of the charger.",

It charged the tablet, got warm, but did not fail or quit, cool off, and start again like the plastic ones do. Very durable.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a very old USB splitter plug in my car that had 1 port for fast charging. But after recently trying to charge my 30 watt Motorola Edge phone, I realized that it wasn't charging it at all. It was showing connected, but battery was draining. So I searched and ended up buying these 2, and I love em! First cause yes they actually Fast Charge my phone (or Turbo Power as Motorola calls it). And I just love the look of it. It goes into the plug with nothing sticking out, just flat with the port holes. It looks amazing.",
