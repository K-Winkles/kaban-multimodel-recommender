                "reviewText": "You get 4 of these for $12.99. That's a great deal!!! They are very detailed and very solid. Soooooo pretty! I got the silver. The pearl on the body is a light bronze color.One thing that I HAVE to say... Don't pay attention to the reviews that say the fragrance tabs fall out. They are not installing them properly!!! When you are actually attaching the clip part to the bee you have to slide it on so the fragrance tab slot faces up when the bee is positioned on the vent!!! The clip part installs in several ways so you have to pay attention to that!!! The bee will be facing up and to the right when installed. There is no other direction for it to be able to face!!! So all 4 bees will have to face the same way.The fragrance is non-existent. It's very vague when the blowing air is on Hot. I have some other vent clips where the tabs came without fragrance. They are a soft felt that you add your own fragrance to. I am going to try what someone else did. They rinsed the tab in water and let it dry and added their own essential oil. I did notice that on this listing page they had another listing picture at the bottom where there are 10 tabs for sale in several fragrance choices. I think they would be the same as these included ones. No fragrance... So I really don't have a definite answer...I really purchased these for the blingy car accessories I think they are! I have these clipped along with a large flower ($11 each) per vent!!! Yes... My dash looks like it has everything but the kitchen sink on it... VERY BLINGY!!! But I LOOOOOVE it!!! My justification is that I am a Master Gardener and I NEED the bees pollinating the flowers. Secretly, I feel the blingier the better!!! It makes me HAPPY!!!",

I stuffed a cotton ball in the empty space in the back of the bee then put a few drops of my favorite essential oil on the cotton ball. Scent lastest more than 1 week then I added more drops of oil. Eventually, I will change the cotton ball and start over. It's a great way to get the scent you prefer and it's a cheaper way to make your car smell nice.
