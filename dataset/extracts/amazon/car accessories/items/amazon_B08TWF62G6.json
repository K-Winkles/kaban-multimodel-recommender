This works perfectly and even holds my license and registration. Even though the leather doesn\u2019t feel very quality (I doubt it\u2019s real leather), it\u2019s so cheap that I will definitely buy it again if this one breaks after a year.",

So when you go to pull it out you end up stretching the pleather. Then when you flip the visor everything falls out of those pockets. Once they've been stretched it's too late. I wish they were more elastic instead. But over all I like it, it's a cute addition to my watermelon car theme.",

If you have a smart phone with otterbox, won\u2019t fit, mine didn\u2019t. Thin phone will without a case should would be fine. The sunglass flap, seems good, but I don\u2019t wear glasses. The zipper flap looked fine and worked well. This visor is thin, and serves its purpose and seems well made. Just keep in mind, not made to hold bulky items like a bologna sandwich.",

I love how it has multiple card holder spots, but do be careful if you flip your down, cause 1 might fall out in the looser pocket. It holds my registration and insurance card perfect and was really helpful when I got pulled over recently and had to get the information out quickly. I also use the pocket on the top for quick access to cash, which is helpful at a fast food drive through. All in all I give this product 5 stars, it's worth it.",
