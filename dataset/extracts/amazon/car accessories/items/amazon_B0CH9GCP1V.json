                "reviewText": "I am short, so shoulder straps in most cars end up cutting into my neck. I got this seat belt cover to remedy that. Cover is definitely well padded and comfortable, but it tends to slide easily down the seat belt strap and I end up with the strap cutting into my neck again. Also, it is very awkward when you unbuckle your seat belt and the belt tries to retract back into position. The cover gets in the way and the seatbelt ends up hanging down where it can either get stuck in the door or hook you as you are getting out of the car. So, you have to slide the belt manually through the cover so it can retract. Truthfully, the jury is still out on whether or not I will continue using this. I'm not sure hassling with it is worth the benefit it provides.",

                "reviewText": "Review of: Osilly 2PCS Car Seat Belt Cover, (Black)As I am not the tallest person in the world, I\u2019ve found that the seat belt on my car keeps rubbing on my collarbone and even though I have adjusted the seat belt height to all kinds of different positions, nothing really helps.So I got these Osilly Seatbelt Covers hoping it would solve the issue.They are, indeed, really easy (using the hook&loop flap) to put on and off the seat belt so that is a plus though I did notice that I have to put the flap side of the product (the part that doesn\u2019t show all the nice stitching) upward in order to have the flatter side against my body; which was a bit of a surprise as it is opposite of how the first picture on the product page shows the product being used.Still, that\u2019s a small issue for me as comfort is more important than looks.The first time I used the cover, though, I found that the seat belt itself couldn\u2019t retract if the cover was still up near the height adjustment. I didn\u2019t want to have to remove these every time. But it turns out that if the cover is fastened loosely enough I can slide the cover down as I retract the seat belt and then just slide them back up when I\u2019m ready to go again. A little awkward, but not bad.Try as I might, though, I couldn\u2019t find a place where the cover actually helped. Putting the cover over the spot that was rubbing my collarbone just meant that now the cover was the thing rubbing the collarbone.Then, I pushed it up out of the way...success! I tucked it far enough into the shoulder height adjustment slot that I could use it to give me slack in the seat belt itself...and that was enough to keep the belt off of my collarbone. So, not the way this was intended to be used...but for the price, it worked for me.Another family member, though, especially when using the seat belt cover on the driver\u2019s side (where the height of the seat itself can be adjusted up/down) had a more \u2018typical\u2019 reaction to the seat belt covers and found that the extra cushion provided by the cover did help reduce the pressure felt across the upper chest.And, as far as cushion is concerned, the overall softness/comfort level of these seat belt covers falls into my \u2018just okay\u2019 category; not a thick as I would have liked but sufficient to help.And I love that I got it in the black with the orange/red stitching so I matches my upholstery perfectly.Overall, especially at a price of right around $8 for a two pack, and considering the decent build quality of the product, I think the seat belt covers are a nice to have addition to the car.If this review was helpful, please click the Helpful button below as that helps me know that I'm providing useful information in these reviews.",
