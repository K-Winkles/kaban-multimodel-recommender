                "reviewText": "I've bought more expensive microfiber cloths before and these feel the same if not better. I bought the 50 count/4 color pack and I mainly use them to clean my car. They work especially well for cleaning the bug splatter on the headlights and front end of the car. You obviously have to apply pressure and multiple passes, but they effectively remove the bug mess without scratching the clear coat. I like having multiple colors that way I use the same color for the same task every time, and I can keep the ones I use for waxing separate when washing them.The cloth itself is thin but doesn't feel cheaply woven. The size is fairly small, so if you're using them for big projects (washing, waxing, drying, etc.) expect to use several for each task, but that's why I bought the 50 count pack. The cloths do leave lint behind if you use them straight out of the bag, but after the first wash the lint left behind is minimal and are perfect for dusting/cleaning the interior of the car.Overall, I'm happy with these cloths. Quality is more than adequate for the price.",

                "reviewText": "These HOMEXCEL Microfiber Cleaning Cloths have completely revolutionized the way I approach cleaning in my household. Before discovering these incredible cloths, I was a self-proclaimed paper towel addict, mindlessly using them for every little spill or cleaning task. Little did I realize the financial drain it was causing, adding up to over $100 a month on paper towels alone.What prompted me to make the switch was my experience at the car wash, where they use similar microfiber towels for cleaning and drying cars. These towels are incredibly absorbent and effective, and I was impressed by how well they performed. It got me thinking, why not use these at home?So, I purchased three packs of these HOMEXCEL Microfiber Cleaning Cloths, and it turned out to be a game-changer. I have a dedicated drawer in my kitchen cabinets filled to the brim with these cloths. Now, whenever there's a mess or a cleaning task, my instinct is to grab one of these microfiber towels.What makes them so remarkable is their reusability. I use each cloth once, whether it's dirty or not, and then toss it in the washing machine. They come out of the wash spotlessly clean, fresh, and smelling good, ready to be used again and again.Even if I use them for something unsanitary or one-time-use, the affordability of these cloths allows me to throw them away without hesitation. They are so inexpensive that it's a cost-effective choice, saving me a significant amount of money compared to my previous paper towel habit.In summary, these HOMEXCEL Microfiber Cleaning Cloths are a life-changing alternative to paper towels. They are incredibly versatile, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. Whether you need to clean up spills, dry dishes, or tackle any household task, these cloths are up to the challenge. Say goodbye to excessive paper towel expenses and make the switch to these microfiber cloths \u2013 you won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "I like microfiber cloths for doing dishes. These are the best I've ever had.They're a good size, 11\" x 11.5\". I find these large enough to easily cover a reasonable surface area but small enough to get into glassware.They're very soft and absorbent. They sop up liquids without smearing them all over while trying to pick them up.One side has some texture to it whereas the other side is smooth, but not slick.They clean up well. I got black cloths. They didn't bleed when I washed them with other towels although they do tend to pick up a little lint if they're washed with other towels.On the whole, these are just what I was looking for. It would have been nice to have other colors to choose from but these are working for me.",

Will definitely not be able to dry anything without so many that it would be pointless to try. Very very disappointed. I order microfiber so I could get a thicker product. One side is scratchy, and the other is sort of soft. But definitely not like a thicker product like I was hoping for! Will now have to go to my dollar store to buy my go to brand for a dollar a cloth! I added a video above for the video of the product I just bought, and a picture on the right that shows this product on the left, and my go to dollar store brand on the right. Heading to dollar store for more! ***complete change*** I washed them in Downy Calm Vanilla and lavender fabric softener\u2026 they turned out absolutely perfect!! So fluffy, soft and super absorbent! Highly recommended!!",

Currently I am using green and yellow for kitchen ( Green for dishes and yellow for countertops). I am using blue and pink for bathroom ( blue for toilet and pink for counter).
