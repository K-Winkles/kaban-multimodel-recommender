                "reviewText": "This cable actually works pretty well. The one thing I like about it is that you actually are able to sync on all the ports which is nice. Most of the time only one of the cables can sync and the rest is just charging but this one sync and charges them all. It is a bit bulky on the center piece but it is also very sturdy. It is made of very hard plastic. Even if you were to accidentally drop it or put it in your extremely packed bag, the cable would be pretty nicely protected. It does come with all three types of plugs generally in use today. They are the type c, micro USB, and lightning. They do support data transfer however it is only at the usb 2.0 speed so be aware of that. It does support fast charging however you will need to ensure that you have the appropriate charger to utilize the fast charging. You also can only have one device plugged in at a time to charge as the ports spacing does not allow multiple device charging. The cables are not extremely long it is only a traditional three foot cable. The cable itself is a flat cable. It is tough but extremely thin so it can be retracted and compact. This is definitely nice to have for if you are traveling or even for your car so you do not have to worry about guest needing what cable because you will most likely have the cable type they need unless they still use a 4 pin or 30 pin apple cable (older tech). The cable ends are solid similar size to your traditional cables so you do not have to worry about them breaking although put care when using a micro USB as in time the teeth may lose tension overtime. Overall this cable set is great as it is very portable and tough so you can take it just about anywhere.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many of these types of retractable extension cords in the past. Quite often, they get tangled up, and the cord does not feed out and back in like you want it to. But these actually work. I plugged it into a USB charging port, and whenever I want it, I just pull the end of the cord and it easily pulls out and clicks into a holding position. I give a little tug and it retracts perfectly with no tangled mess. Every time. Highly recommend for saving from the usual cord confusion and a messy space.",

Throw them in your car, RV or suitcase and you\u2019re good to go. I\u2019ve bought them several times because I keep giving them away to friends and family.",

In my opinion, the cable is not able to charge two devices at the same time, however, it takes up so little space, making the area so much more attractive. The cable opens and closes easily. Also, it is perfect for travel! I give them as gifts. Just make sure that it extends to the length that you want.",

I would have to complete have to turn the car off, unplug, start the car, plug in and then it would start working again, but again only temporally. I really love the design, but would like to know if can replace the one I have? perhaps this one was a defected?",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Multi Charging Cable 3.3ft 2Pack Retractable Sync Charger Cable and I have to say, I am very impressed with this product! As someone who uses multiple devices on a daily basis, this multi USB cable has been an absolute lifesaver. One of the things I love about this cable is how it is retractable, which means I no longer have to deal with long cords cluttering up my car's dash area. The cable can be extended to the desired length and then retracted back into a neat, compact size when not in use. Another great feature of this cable is its versatility. With Lightning, Micro USB, and Type C connectors all in one cable, I am able to charge all of my devices without having to carry multiple cords with me. In terms of charging speed, I have found that this cable provides a fast and efficient charge for all of my devices. I have not experienced any issues with slow charging or any other problems. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Multi Charging Cable 3.3ft 2Pack Retractable Sync Charger Cable. It is a high-quality product that has made my life easier and more convenient. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile multi USB cable.",
