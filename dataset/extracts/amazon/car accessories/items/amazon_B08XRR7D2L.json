                "reviewText": "I've been using Febreze Unstopables Vent Clips for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed with them. They're small and unobtrusive, but they pack a powerful punch when it comes to eliminating odors. I've tried other car air fresheners before that either didn't work at all or masked the odors with an even stronger, artificial scent. But these clips are different. They actually seem to neutralize the odors, leaving my car smelling fresh and clean. I really like the fresh scent. It's not too strong or overpowering, but it's still noticeable and pleasant. And the best part is that it lasts! I've had the clips in my car for a few weeks now, and I can still smell the fresh scent every time I get in. The clips are also very easy to use. You just clip them onto your car's vent and adjust the scent level to your liking. They're also very affordable, so you don't have to break the bank to keep your smelling great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who's looking for a way to eliminate odors and freshen up their car.",
