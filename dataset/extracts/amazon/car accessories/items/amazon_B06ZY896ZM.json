                "reviewText": "I replaced my old vehicle with a newer one, and added new floor mats (laser cut specifically to the model of vehicle). My home cordless vacuum was a challenge to get into crevices and lacked the suction needed. I caught this one on sale and when it arrived, I set to work cleaning up my large 8 seat SUV with large cargo area. The cord is long enough that I could vacuum all 4 segments of the cabin from one outlet. My only snag is that the plug dislodges easily from my outlets, but that could be a problem with my outlets, not the vacuum cord. Aside from that, I absolutely love this tool. I can multitask and do a quick tidy of my vehicle while refilling the sizeable fuel tank on my gas gobbler, and get the dirt and crumbs out of there. I have used it on my spouse's cloth upholstered vehicle and gotten dirt dislodged from the seat seams and the carpet. Waiting in the carpool line and tired of playing games on the phone or doom scrolling social media, or maybe killed the phone battery doing those things? Suck up that dirt and avoid being embarrassed about how dirty the car is when the carpool passengers climb abord the magic carpet on wheels. If you're the sort of person like me, living the Hot Mess Life, you can feign looking like you have your shizz together in small moments that are easy to capture. This vacuum comes with an extension hose, crevice tool, brush tool to scrub the dirt loose, a brush tool to clean the sucker tools, a spare filter, and a carry bag to keep it stowed together. Now the bag is great but it would be amazingness to have elasticized mesh pockets for the hose and tools. Or even some hook & loop fastener around the perimeter for the hose portion so that it held the structure of the bag and stayed out of the way when you put the vacuum back in the bag. Even without those things, this little car cleaning kit has simplified my driving life and has come in handy when the kids have jettisoned crumbs under their backsides in the child safety seats. I can now skip having to deal with ants crawling into their seats because we forgot to clean the snacks somebody saved for later. This would be an excellent gift for a baby shower, new driver, no-reason-at-all, you like somebody, your carpool driver keeps a messy car and you want to gently offer a hint that their life could be better and they'd have friends if they just vacuumed the fries out of the seats. This falls under the column of \"Clutter Free Gifts\" because it is useful, stows neatly in the bag and takes up very little room. If you question whether this is a viable purchase, my answer is yes. Just buy the dang thing.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I recently purchased the car vacuum that plugs right into the cigarette lighter, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! This little gem has quickly become my go-to tool for keeping my car clean and tidy on the go.First of all, the convenience factor is off the charts. The fact that it plugs directly into the cigarette lighter means I never have to worry about charging or finding an outlet. It's always ready to go whenever I need it. Plus, the included carrying bag makes it incredibly easy to store and transport. I simply keep it in the backseat, ready to whip out at long stop lights or whenever my car needs a quick sprucing up.Don't let its small size fool you, this car vacuum packs a punch! The suction power is impressive, effortlessly picking up dirt, crumbs, and even pet hair with ease. The nozzle attachments that come with it make it easy to reach those tight corners and crevices, ensuring a thorough cleaning every time. I've been amazed at how effectively it gets rid of dirt and debris, leaving my car looking and feeling fresh.Another feature that I appreciate is the noise level. Unlike other vacuums I've used in the past, this one operates quietly, allowing me to clean without disturbing the peace and quiet of my surroundings. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference.The build quality of this car vacuum is top-notch. It feels sturdy and durable, assuring me that it will last for a long time. The design is sleek and compact, making it easy to handle and store.Overall, I can't recommend this car vacuum enough. It's the perfect companion for anyone who wants to keep their car clean and tidy on the go. With its convenient plug-in design, powerful suction, and compact size, it's a must-have tool for every car owner. Say goodbye to messy car interiors and hello to a spotless ride with this fantastic car vacuum!",

                "reviewText": "To be honest it's a little low on suction power but then again I didn't expect a lot of power from a small machine it takes several passes but the upside is that it's always sitting in your car always ready to be used when you need it consequently now my car is always squeaky clean. If you don't mind a few passes then go for it at least your car is always clean specially if you have kids.",
