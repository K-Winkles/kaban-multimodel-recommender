Was a little surprised it\u2019s a weighted mechanism, it uses your phones weight to close around it so always double check your phone is secure before taking off! I have an iPhone pro max 12 and I noticed it will sometimes be a bit loose, but it\u2019s easily fixed by gently pushing the phone down in the holder. Also has fallen out of my vents a few times but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a design error more my vents in my Highlander aren\u2019t the best for this type of holder as the slats are super close together. I get lots of compliments and have enjoyed having it as a fun addition to my car aesthetics",

                "reviewText": "It's a cute phone mount, but I ended up returning it because the combined weight of it and my phone was too heavy for the car vents. It also didn't grip my phone, like, at all (my phone was more or less resting in it, not being held by it). I don't recommend this because it's heavy enough to move the vent whenever you make a turn - which is highly inconvenient since no one wants to readjust their phone mount all the time (kinda defeats the whole purpose of even having a phone mount)",
