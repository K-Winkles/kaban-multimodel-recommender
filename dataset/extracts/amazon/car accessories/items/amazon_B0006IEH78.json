                "reviewText": "I was worried about using this carrier because I'd never used one before and there were some poor reviews, but I'm so glad I bought it! It turned out to be a lifesaver. It's incredibly sturdy, so much so that I had difficulty unfolding it out of the box. The material is thick and a bit stiff at first use.The carrier isn't heavy at all but it took a bit of muscling to get it packed because the material is stiff. I was able to load/unload the carrier on top of my car by myself using a stepladder.The straps and attachments were strong and the directions were easy to follow. I double knotted the straps and checked them when I stopped for gas, no issues with loosening or slipping.The first trip I made with the carrier was 600 miles with sunny, slightly windy weather. The carrier didn't impact my speed or gas mileage much. The second trip, 300 miles, was in pouring rain. No leaks, everything was perfectly dry!This carrier was a great buy, I'm so glad I got it! It made my move a lot less stressful.",

We fit most all out camping stuff in it ( 2 tents, sleeping bag, stove, 3 life jackets, etc). I was impressed with how much fit in it If packed just right. I would suggest packing the front with a slight angle up for wind. AND, twist the straps 2-3 turns to cut the noise/vibration.",

                "reviewText": "Used to expand on what my KIA Soul could carry. It added 10 cubic feet. The video showed me how to install without having a roof rack. Trip was around 275 miles each way. There was no rain during either direction. Once you\u2019ve tightened the straps down make sure to tie a knot with the excess strap near the buckle. Rightline support said I could have gone with a 15 cubic foot product or a ten. But when I specified my car and model with Amazon it overrode my preference and insisted the 15 was not right for my vehicle. Well built. I used a car roof protector upon which to place the product. I also used something similar to keep contents from shifting. I had some foam pool tubes along so I placed one in the front to keep box corners from poking against the front. But this was only a precaution based on prior experience. Again this is made of durable product and. Of a good design. Due to unfamiliarity it took me 3 times as long to install on the trip out than for the return trip.",

As a result, the adhesive on the Velcro patches that hold down the zipper flap easily melts and the patches tear away.Also, the adhesive is only around the extreme outer edge of the Velcro, there isn't anything in the middle nor are they stitched or reinforced in any way.If you can use one, save your money and get a basic hardtop carrier.If you just need something cheap to throw away later... get this one.",

It comes with 4 straps, 4 door clips and a pull string bag for storage if your not using it.We travelled from vancouver to kelowna 5hrs in a medium rain fall. 3 washroom break in between so we checked the bag on top 3 times it didn\u2019t moved an inch!! When we got into the cabin, the blanket on the top is damp and everything else is dry. It is wet not because of the travel but because it is raining when we are packing. It fits 5 large inflatable recliners, 2 pumps, 1king size blanket, 2 snorkling sets and 1full beach bag but we didn\u2019t over packed it, there is still room. We put a roll of anti-slip kitchen mat to protect the car that we cut to match the size of the bag. We have a cross bar roof rack so we don\u2019t need to use the door clips. We also purchased a rachet strap just to secure it but we didn\u2019t end up using it cause we don\u2019t need it. The straps that goes with it is enough.With a total of 10hrs drive, all dry, didnt moved an inch, full of dead bugs in front the bag when we got home. :-) in total, it\u2019s perfect for us! It is boyfriend approved!Ps: step tool is recommended to pack and unpacked.",
