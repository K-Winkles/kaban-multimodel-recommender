Think throw blanket size.Gets the job done.If you want something that is going to work fast and get HEAT then you will probably have to spend the money to get something nicer. But for how much it costed and just needing a little extra wormth in the cold weather this is not a bad product. It could also be my car outlet/lighter that doesn't have the greatest strength and I have yet to try it in another vehicle.",

If you are looking for a deluxe electric blanket with heat control this one is probably not for you if you were looking for an inexpensive blanket you can keep in your vehicle and use when your legs are cold this is a good choice. Please also note that you need to plug it in to turn it on and pull the plug to turn it off it plugs into a standard cigarette or cigar outlet. I can say after using it two nights that it does not use that much power and it did not drain my battery keeping it on all night long however in my camper I do have multiple batteries. For the price it is an excellent choice. MarkMannM2",

I got this for my daughter who still rides in a booster in the back seat of my truck where the heat takes a while to get. On cold maine winter mornings it can be torture waiting for the truck to warm up so I got this a a possible solution. The blanket is extremely soft has a little bit of weight to it but, unfortunately, it takes forever to heat up as well so, by the time we get her to school it is working at full capacity unfortunately, too little too late also, there\u2019s no power switch, so remembering to plug and unplug it is a bit of a nuisance",

This blanket warms up within a couple of minutes and really keeps you warm. You don't have to have the car on ... It can heat up from your car's battery. I've sat in my car for sometimes upwards of 45 minutes using the blanket and charging it from my car's battery. if you're going to do this it's important that your car battery has an opportunity to recharge. For me personally I have a drive upwards of an hour afterwards so my battery gets to recharge on the drive home. This product is brilliant! I love it!!
