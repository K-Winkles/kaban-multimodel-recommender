I recently tried it and was impressed by its performance. The gel easily molds into hard-to-reach areas, such as air vents, cup holders, and crevices, and effectively lifts dirt, dust, and debris without leaving any residue.One of the standout features of this cleaning gel is its reusability. After use, you can simply store it in its container, and it will maintain its cleaning properties for multiple uses. This makes it a cost-effective and eco-friendly choice compared to disposable cleaning wipes or sprays.The pleasant lavender scent of the gel leaves the car smelling fresh after cleaning. Additionally, it is non-toxic and safe to use on various surfaces, including plastic, glass, and leather, making it versatile for all interior cleaning needs.Overall, I highly recommend Pulidiki car cleaning gel for anyone looking for a convenient and efficient way to maintain a clean car interior. It's a great addition to any car care routine.",

I primarily use it for my office keyboard, and the results are remarkable \u2014 my keyboard has never looked so clean.Initially, the texture of the cleaning gel may seem a bit peculiar, resembling a slightly slimy blob. However, don't let that deter you. The gel works wonders without leaving any residue behind. It's a game-changer for anyone looking to keep their devices spotless. Highly recommended for a hassle-free and thorough cleaning experience!",

                "reviewText": "I pruchased this to use in my vehicle to get into those hard to clean areas. I ended up using it in my dad's work truck to really put it to the test. He is working in a very dusty area with the red dirt....his truck was covered in the thick dust, so a perfect test of the product. He and I cleaned what we could with rags, but I wanted to try this stuff out on the creases and vents. It worked alright. Here are the pros/cons of the product from my initial test:Pros:- Ease of use: This is very easy to use. Just open it up, pull it out, and start dabbing it into the dusty areas. I found that tapping the dust to get the worst of it off before dragging it over a second time worked best.- Cleaning: This is good for loose dust. It worked really well at removing the dust in the vents and some of the corners you could not get a rag into.Cons:- Cleaning: This did not remove some of the stuck on dust that a rag would have removed. I also found that getting in tighter crevices did not work very well either. It also left a little greasy feel that may attract dust or that some people may not like on their dashes or inside their vehicles.- Cleaning the product: With as heavy of dust that was in my dad's truck, the gel got pretty dirty. I am not sure the best way to clean it, or if you can even clean it. Rags and towels are easy...just throw them into a washing machine. I'm guessing this is use until completely dirty and throw away.- Messy: This also leaves a greasy feel to your hands. With rags, you can usually minimize this, but this stuff gets all over your fingers, especially the finger you use to press it into vents.Overall, this is something that is a neat idea, but it really is not great. It worked okay at getting loose dirt and dust off of surfaces, but you could also get the same results from using something like tape or wrapping a small tool with some cloth and using cleaning agents. This might make a cheap, fun stocking stuffer if you want to get something that is different. Personally, I don't think I'll buy this again and just use rags.",

I've had it for a while and tried to use it, but it separated and would not stay adhered to itself. It was all over my hands and even dripped. I used paper towels to clean my hands, but it smeared all over them. I never did use it to clean some dials for fear it would get all over everything. Pulidiki on the other hand worked as advertised and removed the deep dust extremely well. No problem with not coming off or smearing.",
