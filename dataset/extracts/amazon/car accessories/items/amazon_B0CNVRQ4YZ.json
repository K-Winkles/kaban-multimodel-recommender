The good news is that the head is fully compatible with other brands like ESR, so you can always \"Frankenstein\" your own setup. the charging pad is the best i've seen! Super strong hold, powerful induction that punches through thick cases, and to top that off it is made out of smooth rubber that not only prevents scratches but also keeps the phone straight without the additional stabilizing magnets below the ring. Then there is of course the convenience of detaching the cable from the pad if you want wired sound for some reason. Looks great too! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Has a soft-touch base where your phone rests, whiny makes it pretty much impossible to scratch your phone or case. The mount is super sturdy. The chord it comes with has sufficient length. And the base has a blue light around the bezel of the phone rest, which I think is awesome. Magnet is strong, and doesn\u2019t jiggle while driving. I bought this during Black Friday, so it was definitely worth the money. Time will tell as far as durability goes.",

                "reviewText": "This car mount charger had all the features and price I wanted, and looked of good quality construction when I received it. It was easy to set up and attach to my car air vent. However, as soon as I made the MagSafe connection with my iPhone 15 Pro Plus, the charging connection malfunctioned. It would repeatedly cycle on for only 2 to 10 seconds before cycling itself off again, sometimes permanently until I removed and then returned the phone to the connection, only to have it begin cycling again. Tried several times. The phone was down to about 80% battery charge so it should have taken a charge. I bought a different charger of the same basic design and it works perfectly, so there is no problem with the phone, case, or plug in USB-C charge port that I have. Somehow, the electronics within the Lisen were malfunctioning, rendering it unusable. It happens. Amazon made it easy to return and get a refund. Unless other reviews reveal this to be a frequent issue, it might be worth your while to give this one a try.",
