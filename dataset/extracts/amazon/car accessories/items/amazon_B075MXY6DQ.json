After this trip, I plan to keep this in my car permanently.Pros:Compost \u201ctrash\u201d bags fit this car trash bag holder perfectly.The car trash bag has two snaps that snap through the garbage bags to hold them in place.The car trash bag strap fits around the \u201clid\u201d of my console without interfering with using the console storageThe trash is still easily reachable from the front seats for me. It might not be reachable from front seats for everyone.Cons:The seller shows this bag being installed with the strap around the gear shift handle. Never, ever install it that way! Even if there\u2019s only light weight in the trash, I would never want something installed around the gear handle.The installing strap should be longer to allow for different installations.While the two snaps generally hold the trash bag in place, two more snaps would make it more secure.Overall, this trash bag holder worked great on my trip and I\u2019ll keep it in my car.",
