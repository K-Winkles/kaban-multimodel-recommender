                "reviewText": "I saw some reviewers say that these are hard to install and I must say it's true. It's very hard to find the holes required to screw everything back in once you've unscrewed it to install. It took a good while (longer than I think it should've) to install and I couldn't find a way to get all of the screws in because it would've taken aligning like 3-4 different holes in a row so I just settled with the middle screw on each. It didn't help that the screws are so small that I lost multiple during the ordeal. I think that, although the screws lessen the chance for it to come loose, there should be alternatives explored when revising the design of this product (which will probably never happen, but you know)They're definitely a good size and are adorable. I bought them to give a feminine touch to my Honda Civic and I think they do the job well! I would recommend these, but of course explore your options when deciding which brand to buy.",
