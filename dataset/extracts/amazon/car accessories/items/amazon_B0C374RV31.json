                "reviewText": "We mainly use it to prevent things from falling between the seat/center console and ending up under the seat. It fits nicely in our Tesla m3, color goes well with the black interior. Storage is fine to hold your phone or other slim items. Set of 2 is ideal for us as we put one in each of our cars. Overally extremely happy with this and highly recommend if you usually dig under your car seat looking for your phone every week (like we used to do)...",
