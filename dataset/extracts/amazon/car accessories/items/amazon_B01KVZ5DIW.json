But for the price, you could easily get stronger double sided tape and fix the issue. for the price i\u2019m actually surprised. other people have mentioned they usually break after a bit so i might update, but as for now they look great in my crown vic. Super easy to install and the brightness is like any room LED lights. easily adjustable if too bright.",

Its fairly bright and I like that the strips are actually black and not LEDs on a White Background.However I plugged them in after routing the wires through the vehicle and when I plugged them in they were a medium purplish blue. I went to change color and only this mix of red and blue or green worked. Tired the Wireless remote and could only get these two colors. Tried the remote that is part of the wiring harness and that does absolutely nothing. Lived with it as this blue'ish purple color as it matches my vehicle anyway. After installed for about a week it was annoying me that it doesnt work like its suppose to so start moving wires. As soon as I touched one of the four LED strips, the entire system turned red and the Wireless remote ( not the wired one ) seemed to control it. So now if I want a different color I have to wiggle one of the wires.If it wasnt for that it would be well worth the money. Maybe you will get a good one unlike mine.",
