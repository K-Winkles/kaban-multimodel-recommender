The brush is nice for dust and nooks and crannies, however much like any dusting it seems to settle right back. I don't think that's necessarily the products fault. Maybe I just don't know the secret to dusting. I do like it though and will keep it. I use it when I clean the car and it's nice to have and is easily stored in the center console.",
