I only got the one stand to put on my car the adhesion did not stick well it did come with two but the second one I needed to let sit, so it could stick, it did fit my phone but with no case I have a silicone case it does not fit!! But my other one did and it was a plastic one. in about an hour I went back in my car and I put my phone through and it did stick and stay so it might take a while for it to work, it does suck that I didn\u2019t get the air vent one. overall a 4/ 10. If you want this, you might just wanna have it for the looks not for actual use.Also, when I opened my Amazon package, the box it came in was already opened, it didn\u2019t come sealed or nothing. And with the missing piece still upsetting.",
