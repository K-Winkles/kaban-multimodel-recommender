These came in a nice, durable plastic case which is great for keeping them organized and stashed away until i need them ... especially since there are so many (also a bonus).Easy to apply, and i like how the stay attached to the chord when not in use, so you don't lose it. I travel a lot and have lost a fair number on planes and wherever when i uncurl a chord and put the clasp ... somewhere. NOT ANYMORE.Only downside: i wish the set had some shorter ones as well for smaller chords. on a few of my super short chords i had to wrap it around 3 times to keep it closed. But that doesn't really bother me.",

These cable straps have helped me organize/maintain my cords and other tech accessories. Plus, I LUV the color. I can also appreciate that there are many in a pack; I will actually be gifting some extra as stocking stuffers. I haven't had any break or snap yet, they tend to stretch really well. These cable straps are pretty easy to use and are nifty little things to have on hand to stay organized.",
