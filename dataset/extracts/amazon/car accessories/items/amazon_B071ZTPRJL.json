                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice look and perfect \"sheen\"..",
                "reviewText": "I've been an avid detailer for 30 years. And I do love the chemicals aspect of it. I've tried many products, and the vast majority of them aren't very good. Mind you, I was starting out detailing back in the 80's, when you had a VERY limited amount of products to rely on (And yes, I remember the very first days of Armor-All when it would CRACK your dash.. Those days are, of course, long gone.But I have been a big fan of Chemical Guy's products, and have written many reviews on here about their other products.This Total Interior, I have to say, has met or exceeded my expectations.Tip and note: Always wear nitrile type gloves whenever using any chemicals for detailing, repair, etc A garage isn't complete without nitrile gloves and an air compressor.. Enough on that.First off, they say you can use it on glass, and this would replace a lot of other cleaners and protectants, I'm not sure I would use anything to clean glass other than Invisible Glass. I've tried them all, and to me, Invisible Glass is my go-to and ONLY glass cleaner.Secondly, this DOES have a UV protectant in it, which of course, led me to purchase this. I've said on here before that if you are going to take the time to detail, and make the effort, you should not waste your time with products (Especially interior products) that don't protect the interior from UV damage.. The sun is a killer on leather and plastic.. (And paint, over time).. So if you're going to use any products on your interior make sure they have UV protectants.Thirdly, they say you can use this on Leather. I for one, after working with it, probably wouldn't use it on my leather, I prefer some other products for that, and yes, don't bother using ANY leather treatment unless it has a UV protectant in it, or at least follow it up with something that DOES have a UV protectant. I personally wouldn't use this on my leather. I would use Chemical Guys' Sprayable Leather Cleaner and Conditioner (no UV protectant), and then follow it with Klasse Interior as the Klasse has a UV protectant. The Klasse is also a water based formula (The original was oil based) and it also helps to tighten the leather a bit too.. Those two in combination make a nice look.What's nice about this Total Interior Cleaner Protectant (TICP) is the way it goes on. You want to use a fairly deep piled Microfiber cloth to apply it. Pre wet the cloth with distilled water in a spray bottle.Spray the TICP generously on the interior doors and plastics. It works especially well cleaning off your armrests and control modules for windows, door locks. I would generously spray it on the door panels and work it in, but I would not spray it directly on my speaker grills or into the control buttons, you want to work around that. For those areas, after you do the general door panels, or interior, and then come back and spray on your towel, and then hit the specific areas.For the front dash, and the LCD screen, I sprayed onto my pre moistened towel, worked it in nicely, then I quickly grabbed another microfiber towel that didn't have a \"pile\" on it. Almost like those microfiber dishtowels. The reason why is when you go for that quick buff (And just a quick buff, that's all you need) you can and will create some static.. And when you create that static you'll break off peach fuzz off a piled microfiber cloth and it may stick due to the static. So use a microfiber towel with no pile on it and quickly buff it, you don't need much, this product is \"hot\" and dries fairly quickly, a couple swipes, that's it.I did get the baby oil scent, and it's reminiscent of that, but not too strong or overdone. A nice fragrance. It comes in a couple other scents.The final look is very nice, it's not a shine or a heavy sheen, it's in between the OEM flat look (When you first purchase a new car) and a light satin. Just enough sheen to spruce up the interior, but not like a basted turkey that looks greasy or oily. Just right.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because it was a good deal and my last go to cleaner raised the price to $20 a bottle. This cleaner did surprisingly well! I thought my steering wheel of a new used car had UV damage. Turns out it just needed this cleaner and was the past owners grime. Cleaned the steering wheel and dash to looking new! Did great on the leather too. I kept a dry towel to wipe off any excess. There is a spray and stream selection on the bottle which was nice. I used the spray. I have the fresh scent and it was a nice smell and not overwhelming at all.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to use as an interior cleaner for my car. The item arrived as described, the spray nozzle works fine, and I personally feel like it's a good value (size and price point). As far as its cleaning properties, I would say it does a good job. I've used this by spraying it onto a microfiber cloth, brush, and directly on some areas. I haven't used it on glass yet, but I imagine it would work well as intended.Now I purchased the scent \"fresh\" and it is absolutely AMAZING. I would say it's one of the best things I've ever smelled in my entire life. It's definitely a fresh and clean scent, and makes me think of how my car smelled when first purchased. I'm a little disappointed that the company doesn't offer hanging or vent air fresheners in the same scent.All around I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of purchasing.",

It's a little on the pricy side for a cleaner, but you do get your money's worth.It does a great job of cleaning screens and trim. You can also use it to clean the upholstery of your car.It doesn't leave a residue which is nice.Overall it's a great product, which you can buy on Amazon but also in retail stores that sell automotive cleaning products (they are a biggish brand)Worth the price and purchase.",

I have a couple of spots on my leather seats where coffee has spilled. I'm talking dime-sized drips. This wouldn't even take those off. It works well for dust and works great on nav screens and plastic. It left a bit of a film on the inside of the windshield, but nothing too bad as I only notice it in direct sunlight. All in all, I'll use the rest of the bottle, but I wouldn't purchase again.Also, I ordered this and another product from the chemical guys. One bottle leaked in the box and had a cracked sprayer cap. I reached out to customer service and heard nothing back. I wound up having to decant into my own sprayer, but I lost a few ounces of fluid (i.e. $$$$), which sucks.",
