                "reviewText": "We purchased 3 of these, in different color/patterns, to store our clothes under the edge of the bed in our DIY camper. So many pockets! and enough dividers to make very functional organization. We them up in the house, then slide them under the bed and go! Much easier than moving items from the house drawers to camper drawers.I gave 4-stars for durability, only because they are fabric. The nylon-webbing binding the edges/seams is an excellent construction detail, but will wear and fray over time if I slide them around on a rough floor. I would not want them to be built any other way. It is a very functional design, stays open, yet can be collapsed easily. The stiff plastic panels that make the body are more durable, and I don't have any worries about that. But with the edges...well, they will last as long as I care for them.",
