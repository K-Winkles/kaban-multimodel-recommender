They are super easy to install-they just clip on your headrest supports. I have them on my headrest facing the backseat. Use them to hold my purchases whilst I\u2019m driving, instead of them sliding along the back seat. Also put one on the passenger seat facing the front of the car-use it to put my purse on so I can get at it easy. These are so sturdy and lovely at the same time. Liked them so much when I first bit them that I bit them 2 more times.",
