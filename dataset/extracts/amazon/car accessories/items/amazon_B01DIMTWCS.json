This collapsible multi-compartment car organizer deserves every bit of its five-star rating for the following reasons:1. Incredible Storage Capacity (\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50):The FORTEM Car Trunk Organizer offers an impressive amount of storage space. The multiple compartments, pockets, and dividers provide a designated spot for everything \u2013 from groceries and sports gear to emergency supplies. It turns my trunk into a neatly organized space.2. Durable and Sturdy Construction (\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50):The build quality of this organizer is outstanding. The reinforced stitching and robust materials ensure durability and longevity. Even when fully loaded, the organizer maintains its shape, standing up to the demands of daily use without showing any signs of wear and tear.3. Easy to Collapse and Expand (\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50):The collapsible design is a game-changer. When not in use, it folds flat effortlessly, allowing for easy storage. When needed, it expands and locks into place with a satisfying click. The collapsible feature makes it incredibly versatile and adaptable to my changing storage needs.4.

                "reviewText": "I like the ease of folding if I ever need that. I just keep it open with the divider to make 3 sections. The very bottom of it is just material. You get an insert for the bottom the is the material with cardboard inside. You insert that for the bottom of course...lol.Versatility is good for me. My hatchback car has a few places to connect the 2 holding straps that come with it. I use 2 straps connected to right side at rear of car. Otherwise using 2 straps (right side and left side) centers it and makes smaller gaps on the sides of it to put more stuff if needed. Works fine on one side of car.The cover with Velcro is just that - a cover with cardboard inserts. Daisy chaining more of them is a nice feature but, I don't need that feature as of yet. Other similar items have handles that extend above by about 2 inches which makes it inconvenient to stack things on those products. You can stack on top of this one because the box height is the same and the privacy/dust cover helps with having a flat surface to stack on.It's now easy to organize stuff I want in my car - frequent used/emergency items in this container while roadside emergency/car maintenance items in a mechanics bag I had. Sturdiness seems ok for now. I will see how long the cardboard holds up. I cover it up with a moving blanket I had to protect it from dust, dirt, and the zooming radiation that comes from our Sun. I got a lighting deal so cost (value) is better for me which matches the cost of other brands.It's new and protected so I don't need to clean it - \ud83d\udc4d.Consider this one to purchase, but I would get the larger ones if I had a bigger car.",

Collapsable with luggage type locks and comes with hooks you can use to affix to car interior even for more stability. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I'm using this to store things in the bed of a 2018 Toyota Tacoma with a tonneau cover. Rather than an affixed bed box, or just letting things slide around the bed, the Fortem organizer really lets me store what I need to, in an easy-to-use, easy to configure, easy to move way.It can be configured in a variety of ways, including creating up to three compartments, with the included divider walls. I have it set up with 2 dividers for three evenly-sized compartments. It also includes a wide variety of pockets/pouches along the outside, carry handles, attachment straps, and a lid/top if you want to cover your items, which is easily secured with velcro.Currently, I have 4L+ containers of fluids (windshield washer, oil), a funnel, paper towels, heavy duty tow strap, ratchet straps/tie downs and reusable grocery bags in the compartments. In the pouches I store hand tools that I might need quick access to. There is plenty of space in each compartment to comfortably hold what I need.If I have any \"complaints\", they are:1. it could be a bit taller/higher. The lid fits over most things, but taller containers cause it to lift. On the plus side, since the lid is so easy to use, it's not a problem getting things in and out of it. This is more of a \"me\" problem, than a problem with the Fortem.2. The straps that can be used to secure it in place could have a bit more travel, to create a nice and tight connection. I have the Fortem right behind the tailgate on my truck, so I can drop the 'gate and quickly get to what I need. I have some anchor points in that area, and have it centered between them. While I have never had an issue of it losing its anchor point and sliding around the bed, I would still prefer if the straps included a carabiner or other closed attachment point, and have a bit more travel on the straps, to really hold it in place.Note, these are not complaints about the item itself; it works well and is real value for money. These are just the things I would change if I was the product manager.I've had it for a while now and see no signs of wear, and have had no issues with it whatsoever. If you are looking for a reasonably-priced storage solution for your car or truck (or even storage at home, for that matter), the Fortem is versatile, attractive, and durable. 5 stars and if it continues to hold up to use, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.",
