Either some sort of chemical used in production smells strongly like cigarette smoke, or the one sent to me was kept in brand new condition in a heavy smoker's house and then returned and sent to me. It's really strong so I'm worried about it stinking up my car, so I threw a little baking soda in there to see if it can deodorize some of it.",
