This one actually stays where you put it. Can handle many different sized phone covers. Sturdy enough to cushion the car's movements and keep the screen steady (landscape view only). Super simple to install and no moving parts. Love it!",

It fits right in there. If you have armorall on your dash clean it off before you press it on to your dash. So far it's been durable and I love it. I probably misspelled armorall. LOL",

                "reviewText": "I was struggling to find a phone holder I could use for my car, it\u2019s a compact. So even if I have the air control turned all the way off, there will still be some air coming through the vents. I think they set it up that way intentionally for ventilation and safety. But for me what it means is I can set it all the way on defrost and there will still be air coming through the passenger cab vents. So I can\u2019t use a vent clip for my phone in winter or the phone will overheat and shut off. I\u2019ve tried the window suction cups, but they eventually fall down, which is unsafe while you\u2019re driving. I tried the cup holder kind, but it holds the phone at an awkward angle if you\u2019re using it for navigation. I\u2019d rather have it somewhere I can see it without turning. This holder solves all those problems. I did find that the sun on the window can cause the phone to overheat in summer, but then I switched the AC from passenger cab/feet to defrost/feet, and it actually worked and kept the cab at a comfortable temperature and also kept the phone from overheating again.The sticky pad has loosened up a couple times, but I pushed it back down and it re-adhered without a problem. I feel like it has the right level of adhesion, so it\u2019s not going to slide around, but you can get it off if you want to.",
