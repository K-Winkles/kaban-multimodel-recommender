And I pretty much live in my car during the work week hours, in my profession i work in the field using my personal vehicle so it\u2019s nice to have a spacious trash bin in my car, so I don\u2019t feel the need to stop as often to throw trash away. I medically have OCD and have to keep my car clean and free from litter, and having a trash container of this size helps tremendously. It is very good quality and has side pockets for extra storage if needed.",

We stored a large bottle of water in it because we were afraid the bottle would leak. I was amazed that it actually held up quite nicely to the weight. Also, the slotted pass through in the top kept it's shape after repeated use. Seems to be well made.The only problem I have with this container, is attaching trash liners to the inside. There are little hooks on each side (I'm assuming these are to secure the garbage bag). These hooks worked fine, but there's no way to secure the bag in the back. After using it on our recent trip, I found that half of my throw always went behind the liner bag. This isn't a deal breaker for me. I'm sure I'll find a work around. Overall, I still really like this container.",

It\u2019s so useful to have a place to collect any garbage so that the car stays neat and clean. I also like the plastic insulated sides, so that I can easily clean it out and use it as a cooler as well!",
