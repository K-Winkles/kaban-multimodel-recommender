I keep having stuff fall out of my jacket pocket while I am driving...keys, pen, coins, candy, etc...The frustrating part is to get onto my old knees to reach into my car head first and contort myself to try and dig whatever fell out of my pocket. Trust me when I tell you, it's not a pretty sight to see...lolThis Car Seat Gap Filler by KOVSPO is perfect, took me seconds to install, it's that easy and effortlessly to do. I have a newer Outback and now, no more worries of stuff falling out of my pocket.I do wish the the little indentations on the seat gap filler were a bit wider as my android phone with the Otterbox case does not fit into it, not a big deal as the purpose was the fill the gap between the console and the seat and it does so perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I put these in a 2013 Toyota minivan. They seem to fit fine and provide a nice barrier to my phone sliding off the center console and down between the console and the seat. They slide right in and can be removed easily for cleaning. There is some gapping around the seatbelt area but nothing significant although coins might be able to slip down around the gaps in that area but nothing much larger than that should be able to get past them. So far, I've only had 1 that I caught the edge off and inadvertently moved out of position even though they are only slid into place. If you are looking for a universal gap filler between the front seat and the center console, these seem to fit the bill.",

Short of pulling over, there is no safe way of retrieving my stuff while in the driver\u2019s seat. These are the perfect solution! They\u2019re easy to install, made of some durable looking materials, do exactly what they claim, and have a great price point! I\u2019m very happy with this purchase!",
