I did a good job so it is hard to see it is there (had stiff in the box for that) and if you don\u2019t like them just tern them off. The remote is trash I just use the app when I\u2019m letting the truck warm up and I just keep it on red or blue so not that difficult. Would buy again",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the lights. The adhesive is not the best. The back ones I used the velcro and stuck them to the back of the seat which is like a soft velcro so that worked great. The front ones are harder since it's not fabric. Also the control is terrible. It worked once and then never again. Luckily it has buttons attached to the plug but you can't customize it as good as with the control. Highly disappointed in that. The app seems to be sketchy and read many reviews warning to stay away and it doesn't work well so that's disappointing as well.",

I don\u2019t blame that on this company though because Minnesotas weather got to a feels like of -45 over the past week so I\u2019m happy the other 3 stayed on.",
