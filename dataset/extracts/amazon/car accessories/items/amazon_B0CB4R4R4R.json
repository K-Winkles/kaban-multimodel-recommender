The beauty of this product is that it holds it vertical so when it gets hot out, the balm doesn't melt and leak into the crevices of wherever the product was. This is 3D printed, so it will have the layering lines. I can't speak to how well it will hold up in the extreme temperatures (freezing winter and hot hot summers), but I do like the way I can keep my lip balm sticks in the car without fear of it destroying something. I put mine on the vertical surface of the dashboard where it extends down to the floor of the car. It does seem like the adhesive is very durable. The holder is discreet and does it's job! I would love to see more options for appearance and a way to get the layering lines to disappear.",
