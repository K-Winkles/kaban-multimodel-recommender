                "reviewText": "Very, very rarely if ever do I write a review, even if I love or hate a product. This stuff\u2026 I\u2019ve been using on and off for probably a year, the first time I used it I was in love. It was winter time, then on a humid hot day I went to use and it was sticking to my skin and suede. I found the fix for that I will describe shortly. First, let me say this\u2026 for years I\u2019ve been searching for a nice compact battery powered vacuum. It didn\u2019t need to be strong, I keep my cars immaculate I will vacuum at home in my garage with a real vacuum. I just wanted a convenient dust buster, not some cumbersome thing with attachments and carrying case. I hated any vacs I tried, until I found this product it is absolutely perfect. Like I said my car is clean but if you are like me and the very minute sub-sector of society that insists on a immaculate interior. You know that you will always get that dust on your screen, dash, cluster, steering column, etc\u2026 this is the perfect solution. If you roll some \u201ctobacco\u201d, have a snack while stuck in a traffic jam or happen to use any powdered illegal products or whatever this is your best friend. I love the stuff period. It last a very long time , I replace mine after a while but have never needed to replace it because it still worked it has a lot of surface area. So it\u2019s cheap and economic, I only had one issue which led me to stop using it for 6 months while it sat on the garage shelf. I felt like it certain weathers and circumstances it would stick to skin and surfaces. I wasn\u2019t wrong, also if you have dry skin or a trades worker that gets dried skin until you get home and take your shower it may stick. My solution is this. Plop it in your hand and kind of shake it , kind of like shaking dice up. I guess it may absorb some moisture for your skin or the air , I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t care but it just works. Just make sure it\u2019s \u201clubricated\u201d before you start using it. I have a theory that maybe a tiny drop of water in the jar and a shake may deliver the same results but I\u2019ve never done it becomes my dice shaking technique works every time for me. I\u2019ve never used any of the other brands so I don\u2019t know if they all perform exactly the same or better or worse. It\u2019s a very simple product, I believe just water and guar gum but I\u2019m not postive. Some may buy it specifically to detail their air vents and I probably bought it for that purpose originally. Also cup holders which sometimes are the hardest thing to actually clean. Definitely is great for stuffing in nooks and crannies and pulling out all dirt and dust. The gaps between buttons on your steering wheel, the gaps around all buttons, it is a simple but genius product. Most importantly it\u2019s great for a daily quick clean up, the results are akin to a fresh vacuum and interior detail. Love this stuff , ordering more right now. Thanks for reading if you made it this far , have a great day and give this gel a shot.",

                "reviewText": "This product is often downvoted because, I think, that those people do not understand.This gell works very well for its intended purpose. Because of the amount of dirt it absorbs, it does not last for more than three of four cleanings. Think about it like using a cigarette - it works perfectly and then it ends.If you want to clean your car as best as this product does, then count on buying a few of them in the knowledge that the gel is not meant to last forever. The dirtier it gets, the faster it will run out. But that's okay, because that is the intended life-cycle.I personally felt that it does a great job, and has managed to clean spaces I could not have otherwise even touched. It works and works well.",

                "reviewText": "I had very little faith that this product would work, but overall I thought it wasn't bad. It's gets dirty more quickly than it claimed, so it doesn't last as long as advertised, but it does pull dirt and dust out of hard to get to places. You have to push it pretty hard into cracks to get it to work, but so far it has pulled out in one piece and brought the dust with it. You do have to be careful to not use it when it is too hot or it will leave pieces of the gel behind when pushed into cracks, but the directions wanrn you of that. It's not a must have or a life changing product, but I can see it making a good stocking stuffer or add on gift for an adult.",

                "reviewText": "I should have suspected I got a bad batch of this cleaning gel when I tipped the jar upside down and the orange slime started pouring into my open palm in a thin stream. All I simply wanted to do was clean the front grill of my round, white Costco desk fan.What happened next occurred so fast I didn\u2019t have time to stop. My left, upturned palm suddenly had slime slithering between my fingers towards the countertop. With swift, cat-like motions, I whisked my hand up and caught the mucous waterfall midstream with my other hand. I let it drip, and run, and ooze back down into the jar it came in, shuddering.But, my hands and fingers, (and in between my fingers) was covered all the way up to my brain that was firing questions in rapid succession, \u201cHow do I get this off? What do I wipe it on? Will it wash down the sink? Will it clog the pipes?\u201d Ewwww!What ensued was what I thought was a good idea: I let the slime dry just a tad then was able to roll parts of it into little worms, proud of my brave thought, \u201cThis is not going down any sink.\u201d The sink would be relieved. I had done a good service.I spied a box of Kleenex on the bed where I had been mourning the loss of a loved one. Yes, that last sentence may merit reading twice.I gingerly\u2014so as not to slime my down comforter\u2014pulled up a tissue with my elbows and thought it would be a clean job. I didn\u2019t know tissue could tear and separate into ephemeral sheets. After some time, the pale orange slime flecked with white nothingness separated from my hands enough to release the ball of tissue that survived with thumb and index finger, like a soiled diaper, into the trash. I wondered if my recently passed older brother was laughing at me from the other side, and saying, \u201cTaking a break from weeping is exactly what you needed right now.",
