I doubt they are real leather, but they are nice and stylish. And although they are sturdy, it was easy enough to adjust the hook down a bit. I would recommend these, but just keep in mind they do work, but the fit is a little loose.",

                "reviewText": "I never knew a product like this existed until I fell down a click hole watching YouTube videos of Amazon items you can't live without. Between deer and other drivers, there are many times I've come to an abrupt stop and my purse goes flying off the passenger seat and on to the floor. When I have a passenger, I put my purse on the floor behind the passenger seat where it moves around until I can't reach it.I searched through many different types of hooks on Amazon and decided on this one for several reasons - they're not plastic and look nice against my \"leather\" seats. They don't stick out very far and can be easily spun around when I have a passenger. They seem pretty sturdy and hold my pretty heavy bag with no problem.The hooks come in a 2-pack, and I have the other one behind the driver's seat so I can hang my lunch bag when I'm heading in to work. My banana no longer gets squished in there when my laptop bag moves around!These hooks are great and really improve the whole experience when I'm driving. Now everything is where I left it and I'm not reaching down to the floor on the passenger side to retrieve my purse or climbing across my passenger seat to get my lunch bag. It's the little things!",

Another set could easily go on the same headrest with no issues. Nothing like having to brake quickly and have your purse or grocery bags go flying to the floorboard. Also, great for that take-out meals that are in bags.",
