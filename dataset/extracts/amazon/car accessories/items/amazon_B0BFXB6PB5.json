When properly positioned, this may double as a desk or a table and is quite durable. It is inexpensive and ought to work in the majority of vehicles. Although I must reposition my seat in order toto use the workstation, doing so is simple, and once I've finished using it, I can move it back to where I need it to drive.The front of the tray table has a curved surface to stop food from slipping off and a cup holder for drinks. The tray's back side is flat and has a pen slot for use when working or reading books.I was astounded by how useful it was as I used it for the first time. The idea of setting the tray on the steering wheel is so simple yet brilliant. The desk is portable and simple to move. It easily fits between my seats when not in use. Anybody would benefit from owning this equipment because you never know when it might be useful.",

It is sturdy enough to hold a lap top or lunch so if it fits it will work. There needs to be better measurements in the description for this. I have a 2013 Lexus ES 350 with the standard steering wheel and no cover on it. This tray looks like its made for a much smaller steering wheel.Update: In an effort to find one of these that would fit I found another that showed it must be installed with the steering wheel upside down. I tried that on this one and it worked so I am able to use it now. I raised it from 1 to 3 stars. It is a tad flimsy but it works ok. You can not put a drink on it if you do not have the steering wheel locked but since I wanted to leave my car running I just put it in the middle and it was fine.",

                "reviewText": "I thought it didnt fit my steering wheel, but then I read the directions and just had to turn my steering wheel upside down! Fit perfectly. It is a bit flimsy if you put your full weight on it or a heavier model laptop like a 15\" HP Laptop. My iPad sat on it fine. Excited to enjoy more take out in my car!",
