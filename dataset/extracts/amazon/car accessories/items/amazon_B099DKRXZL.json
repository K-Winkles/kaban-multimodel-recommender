I installed it in my car attached both sets of bottom straps to my console and I can get into my console without it sliding back or restricting access to anything! It\u2019s a tad wide for the space between my seats. BUT it works great because there aren\u2019t crannies for things to get lost in. I love that it\u2019s a more solid material with many storage spaces for smaller things as opposed to my previous \u201cstorage net\u201d which stretched WAY too much and prevented access to the rear passenger climate controls and USB ports when I put my purse there - it would just act like a stretchy hammock for my purse and the holes were huge and things would fall through them. I love the amount of storage it has and that it doesn\u2019t interfere with my personal space or the rear controls but also stays in place.",

I decided to keep it anyways because of that very reason & it does have lots of pockets. The bottom is fairly sturdy however the sides are mesh so of course they\u2019ll bend and fold over. I use this to store my sunglasses, snacks and water bottles, wet wipes & occasionally my wallet. I haven\u2019t filled it up completely at one given time, so I\u2019m not sure how much weight it\u2019ll hold. However it was easy to install and gets used every time I drive my car.",

At your fingertips, no more reaching in your floor board for your purse. Awesome!",

I had to take it out of my car because the smell was giving me a headache and my kids were complaining about the smell in the car. I am leaving it outside for a few days to see if the smell goes away. If the perfume wasn\u2019t so strong this would be a perfect product. If heavy perfume doesn\u2019t bother you, then this product will be fine for you. Update\u2026 I left it outside for about a week and the smell is still really strong.",
