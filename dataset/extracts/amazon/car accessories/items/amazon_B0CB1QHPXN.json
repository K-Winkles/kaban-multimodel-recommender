                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a great way to add some light to the inside of your car, or anywhere else, these wireless, USB rechargeable LED lights will do the trick! Measuring in at about 2-inches in length and about 1-inch in width, they're compact, and they are BRIGHT! They're diminutive size allows you to add light to the smallest of places.Choose between 7 colors; blue, ice blue, red, white, pink, green, light green, and there is a fade in and out mode that goes through all 7 colors in sequence. The touch sensor design is nice, as it's very responsive - if you graze the top, the color changes. (there's no button - you just touch the top center of the light to change the color)Installation - these are wireless, so they're easy to install, and they've included adhesive mounting strips and magnets. For recharging, the lights are easy to remove from the magnet, but they're strong enough to hold the light in place-they won't easily fall off if you hit a bump.Charging \u2013 connect the lights to the USB cable (included), and they are quickly charged in about 30-40 minutes. However, it's worth noting that the battery life is quite short - lasting only about an hour. So, be prepared to charge them frequently!That said, overall, if you're looking for a fun way to add lights to your cars interior, or anywhere else, I recommend these rechargeable, color changing LED lights. They're small, they're fun and they're bright!",

                "reviewText": "These lights are small and bright, perfect for my car. My gas door and hood release are right next to each other below the dashboard, and they have no marking on them to tell which is which. Many times I thought I was opening the gas door and ended up hitting the hood latch. These little yet powerful lights are going to end that. I leave the house in the dark every morning, and it will be nice to have the auxiliary lights to help me out if I need them. The colors are fun and the entire unit is so small - about 2\" long & 1 inch wide, yet the light is super bright. It's really nice that these are held onto your car interior with a small adhesive pad for the car, and a magnet for the unit, so it's easily detachable in order to recharge them. Super awesome product!",
