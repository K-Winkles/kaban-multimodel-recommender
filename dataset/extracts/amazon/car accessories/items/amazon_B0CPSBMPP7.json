                "reviewText": "Okay listen, It\u2019s a good trash bag. The instructions are infuriatingly small and impossible to understand. I couldn\u2019t tell what they are trying to show you. I\u2019d rather get a paper sheet full of details drawn by hand than a blurry tiny picture on a small card board. Also, videos are great for instructions. Just a thought.Now, I do like that I comes with trash bags (although I\u2019ll always prefer to get environmentally friendly bags) and the material seems fine. But it\u2019s definitely not as sturdy as shown in the pictures. It\u2019s a squared bag. But it\u2019s great for its purpose and the top opening it\u2019s a good addition. I do like it.Also, the hard plastic things that come with it go inside the side straps. You have to pull up a bit and get the plastic inside each inner edge of the strap. It\u2019s confusing because it comes with four so you assume all four go somewhere. But I think they send you two extra ones. If I\u2019m wrong, then it\u2019s because the instructions really don\u2019t help! But again, I think that\u2019s how it goes. Also, See pictures! The plastic thinguie are longer than the straps so it is a challenge to get them in there.",

                "reviewText": "This trash container is very well made; all of the seams and the zipper are securely stitched. The fabric is heavy, the permanent plastic liner is thick and looks like it won't tear easily. They include two of their brand-name bags which are held up securely by the four magnetic snaps. You can use it without a bag, because the plastic liner can be wiped clean, but if you put food trash in it, you may want to use a bag. A grocery store produce bag or any kind of small plastic bag will work.The plastic braces for the sides (to keep it from slumping) were a little hard to wrestle in, but once in, they are sturdy. The package comes with four braces, so I just stuck the extra two into the bottom of the mesh pockets on the sides, to keep the bottom opened up. The three mesh pockets are big enough to store a packet of hand wipes or similar size items. The top unzips to empty, and has a segmented plastic flange to push the trash in through, which keeps down odors. It has a sturdy adjustable strap so you can hang it on the back of the front seat, or other places to be within reach.Good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this and another one. The other was too bulky & this one looks nicer and more stealthy with my black interior. I also like the magnets for the bag. They\u2019re the right out amount of strength in my opinion. I also like that it\u2019s sturdy but also flexible so it stands up but isn\u2019t crowding or uncomfortable if something was pressed against it.Update: It is a bit flimsy. There are 2 pieces included to support the sides but nothing to support the height of the front & back & I prefer a more upright trash can over trash bag solution. So I cut 2 flaps from cardboard boxes to size to support the inner front & back. You can\u2019t see them and it helps keep it\u2019s shape. I recommend the brand look into creating a permanent or removable option similar to this.",
