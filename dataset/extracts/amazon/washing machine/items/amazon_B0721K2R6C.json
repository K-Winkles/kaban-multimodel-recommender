Works great as a dry bag when the rain comes while hiking. Use some liquid \"sink wash\" detergent.",

                "reviewText": "I do like this if you are living out a suitcase or semi in my case since I\u2019m a long haul truck driver. But it\u2019s really just a dry bag with a little almost washboard on one side. Honestly wish that washboard is on both sides and the bag was a bit thicker. And a more quality base with a much thicker material and a small essentially pull tab on the bottom somewhere to allow the bag to hang upside down on a clothes line. I haven\u2019t had any issues with the bags quality as of yet atleast but I wouldn\u2019t trust it to last long for a backpacking trip. At end of the day I would still recommend this if it fits your life.How to use really.Ok after awhile I\u2019ve noticed for a small load that I can do the best is to fill with 3/4 or a full gallon of water. Then add some liquid detergent I go up to the 2 on the tide cap. Then close and shake the bag to mix it up. Then insert pants and wash with some but not much air in the bag. Then pull out just enough to strain out the water/ detergent then wash a long sleeve and repeat washing and straining and do that again with undershirt, underwear then socks. Trust me socks is last to wash. Then if you need to scrub open the bag and use the washboard to scrub whatever that needs extra scrubbing like inside your socks for example. But after you strain out all the clothes and put it off to the side empty the bag and refill with 1/2 a gallon of water then insert clothes the same order you washed and rinse the clothes as you see fit I do it by hand in the bag and strain again. And then hang the clothes to dry however way your gonna do it. Then empty the bag.AdviceHonest this bag is great at washing roughly a full set of clothes but not much more. And take note you should add extra water to begin washing if you have thick cotton clothes since the material will absorb a lot more water than you would expect. So if you where lightweight synthetic hiking clothes for example it will require less water but with 3/4 to a gallon of water it will wash a bit more before needing to change the water to keep it clean. Also I\u2019d recommend closing the bag and letting it hang on a clothes line for an hour then empty the bag by putting it upside down then giving it a fast wipe with a towel to dry it out as best as possible then laying it sideways or hanging it back up until you need to put it away. Also since you are recycling the water if you have long hair it will be on the clothes after washing and rinsing so after your clothes dry run a lint roller on the outside and inside of your clothes a small travel lint roller is worth the dollar or two. And wash underwear and socks inside out.",

I would not put more than 2 T shirts or 3 pairs of socks or 3 pairs of underwear in at one time. Any more than that and you are taking up too much space on the inside to really turn your clothes around and get them on the actual scrubbing section. With that being said I really like this thing!!!! It works well. Just don't over load it and your clothes come out pretty clean. Notice i didn't say REALLY clean. Don't get me wrong the clothes come out clean,,, just not quite as good as a washing machine. Part of the problem would be that you should use a soap that is not so \"sudsy\" to make it easier on you when you rinse the items in the bag. Definitely not degrading this bag at all. It works great for small items. Just know its limitations. I would recommend it %100 to any one that travels/camps/hikes.",

It can be a little messy until you get the hang of it. We washed at night and dried on a packable line during the night or the daytime if we had a balcony with a wall. We weren't those travelers to hang out stuff outside. Only if it couldn't be seen. It worked especially well for underclothing. It packs small and is lightweight. We used small one time use liquid detergent packs. This would also be quite helpful if you were camping or in a trailer for any length of time. NO regrets on this purchase.",
