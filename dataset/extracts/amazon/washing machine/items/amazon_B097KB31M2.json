After a month and a half of using the washer, if you are thinking of buying it, do it.The washer packs more clothes than I thought it would. The spinner is amazing!

                "reviewText": "My daughter and I recently had to move into a tiny cottage, in the mountains, due to a nasty divorce. During the process I had to give up most of my possessions, including my beautiful washer and dryer. We went to a laundromat every other week, hauling our laundry up & down a flight of stairs, sometimes in the rain. Not having a washer reminded me of all we loss. We are active people and my daughter plays sports, she needs her team practice gear washed weekly, which I would wash by hand between laundromat days. FYI: I have always hung dry most items to prevent shrinking and preserve the fabric/color. I have a minky drying rack that holds a lot of clothes and live in sunny CA.My daughter asked how do people living in RV\u2019s wash their clothes? I started googling and watching YouTube videos and found this portable washer. It was delivered to my front door(most delivery services don\u2019t want to go down my stairs.)First impression we were excited with the size of the wash tub and overall aesthetics but concerned about the hose as it is very cheap looking. We started a load inside, using buckets of water, draining into buckets. We had tears of joy! A month later, it\u2019s used outside using the water hose and letting it drain outdoors. I can heat water to add warm water or hot water. I purchased the largest washer and it\u2019s pretty quiet, easy to use, and does a beautiful job on the clothes. The spinner removes almost all of the water from the clothes, cutting down on drying time. The washer is light weight and has side handles, so easy to move, as the weather gets bad it will go back inside. I don\u2019t overload or push down the clothes and think about weight vs. number of items in the washer, however I can do most of our clothes in one load. All of my bedding and dish towels, fit fine and one load. I do drain and refill for a short wash to remove soap as follows: Wash for 12 mins., drain, refill Rinse/wash 5 mins, put in spinner and rinse with water, spin 3mins.or less mins. So far the cheap washer hose is working great, if someone has a better one please post! Tip: I don\u2019t drain the water from the wash tub until after the final spin. I feel it helps distribute weight in the spin tub. I have no rocking. Also if outdoors cover the top, an acorn scratch my top cover. We have overcome so many obstacles and purchasing this washer has helped us persevere. It\u2019s a must for small places or two chicks in the woods.",

                "reviewText": "Never heard of twin tub washers until 2022 and couldn't wait to try one out. Saves me having to go to the laundromat for most of my laundry cleaning needs. It's been almost two years with this particular machine - I've saved so much time, can do laundry whenever I feel like it, and can feel good knowing the machine is being used by only me. It IS hands on so one shouldn't expect it to be like a standard washing machine. Things I've learned: use less detergent than one would use in a full size washer; give laundry two rinses (spin dry between each); be sure to fully drain washer after using machine. For reference: I can easily put a queen top sheet, fitted sheet, four pillowcases plus a couple of wash cloths and dish towels in a load. A lightweight queen size blanket can fit in a load. Two pairs of sweatpants, three oversized long sleeve shirts, several pairs of socks can make up a load. Note: Just know that while larger sized items might be able to fit in the washer, if they're too large, they won't fit into the spinner (dryer - which is not really a dryer, it merely wrings out clothing and does a great job!). Despite my ignorance for not knowing that twin tub washers have existed since the 1960s, I'm glad I found out about them. Quite, quite pleased with this machine - simple to use, fair price, saves time and works really well.",

                "reviewText": "I like this washer/waterdrainer. I consider this to be a manual washing unit. I like the dryer / not dryer because it takes the access water off the clothes. The washing part does a good job as well. Here is where the manual comes in you either have to put the water in yourself you can hook it up to the sink but still you have to be there to monitor. After the first wash and you drain it, to rinse cycle your clothes again you have to put more water in and repeat the cycle by draining. Once done you then put your clothes into the dryer / water expeller. It only does 5 minutes at a time if it's not dry enough for you you have to continue to go and do another five and then another five. My overall opinion this is a great washing machine /dryer if you do not have a automatic washing machine / dryer. It is worth the money to me. I have washed my queen size comforter in the washer by itself. I would only recommend this to people if you have another thing that can expel the water off the comforter because it cannot fit in the dryer. The only blanket or cover that I know can fit in there is a throw cover depending on its size.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I moved into the country in a farm and the house is really old and small. The laundry room had no space for a regular size washer and dryer and I kept having to go to the laundry mat 20 minutes away. This machine is a life saver because it is small enough to fit in the laundry room and it washes clothes like a champ. I got what I expected. Of course I wish it would come with a dryer but the clothes ringer is quite powerful and gets the clothes almost dry to where they're not even dripping after hanging on the drying rack.It's definitely a good idea for people that have no city water service also because it doesn't take too much water to run.",

The spinner takes some getting used to but works well. For best results we run the wash cycle , spin dry, and then a rinse cycle and another spin dry. 2 loads takes us just over an hour and clothes come out clean.",

                "reviewText": "The unit requires purchase of a small piece of meshing for the filter. Open it up and place a piece in made to fit! I noticed a lot of complaints that it didn't catch any lint, but this did the trick for a purchase of under $5.00! Other than that, the unit is awesome, as I had an old 60's model way back when, and I liked that too! Yes it's not fully automatic, but you can reuse water if the load before wasn't that dirty. You also use less soap and fabric softener too. You can't obviously use boiling water as it's plastic, but you can use warm to hot water. Just use common sense. If it's too hot for your hand, then it's too hot for plastic. Then it works fine! It's also light enough to pick up, as I use mine in the bathtub. The pump and spinner also work great!!! I'm very happy!!!",
