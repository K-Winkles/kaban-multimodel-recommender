The small tube that is meant to be used to fill the machine from the sink is not compatible with all sinks, so you may need a bucket/different hose to fill it. Spin function is fantastic, I've found it gets all the water out of most things in 3 minutes, although it can run up to 5 minutes in one go.The machine drains from the bottom, about 1 in above the ground, so make sure you have a plan to position it high enough to drain properly (i.e. over the edge of a tub).

                "reviewText": "Moved into an apartment at the time did not have a washing machine. Purchased this until we could get one, and it worked so good! I never thought our clothes were that dirty but I was so wrong. Water always came out brown. Recommend rinsing the clothing while in spinning portion, but can also do another \u201cwash\u201d cycle and use clean water for a rinse. Spinner spins extremely fast and always got the clothes and towels dry enough to hang on a line or toss in the dryer for 20 mins and they\u2019re completely dry. Was unable to figure out how to get the water inlets to connect to sink or faucet without leaking, and when draining either have to have a drain in the floor or place unit in tub when draining. No pump on machine to remove all the water completely so you may have to lift to get it all to come out.",

                "reviewText": "I wrote a bad review originally, but I had to update after I plugged it into a different socket. Turns out it was my fault. The socket that I had in the washroom was faulty, plugged it into a different socket, and it cranked right up. This is a lifesaver for small areas And beats hand washing by a lot. I live with my parents and I try not to use their stuff too much. They do have a washer and dryer but I\u2019m just more independent and I\u2019m choosing to use this so it\u2019s a good source for me definitely would recommend this product although the customer service absolutely is horrid , they were asking me to send pictures and stuff and I don\u2019t know how to do that on Amazon however through me watching videos on YouTube and stuff. I was able to actually figure it out and I got it to working. The only issue is it does not fit my sink so I have to manually put buckets of water in but that\u2019s the only downside I did end up using my mom and dad\u2019s dryer but it does get the clothes about 80% dry , if you were to hang them out for about 45 minutes they would probably dry fully all in all I have use this product probably about 100 times since I bought it and it\u2019s a great buy for a small areas or even apartments would suggest raising it up a bit because it does hurt my back to do it. It\u2019s pretty short and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 inches I\u2019d say this product is probably about three or 4 foot tall so it is backbreaking almost with how short it is but like I said it does do the job and I wanted to make sure I put an honest review on here for those in the market for one of these customer service sucks but the product is all right. It does the job and makes my clothes smell really good",

                "reviewText": "Neither the washer/agitator motor nor the spin dryer motor worked when I tested this \"new\" machine, which arrived today. I got my sopping wet load of laundry (thankfully small) out of it, drained it, and went to look at the back side. Maybe I could see if something was obviously wrong. (Not that I thought so, but wanted to check.) That's when I saw the screws on the back panel were rusted and stripped! Also there's an area with holes in the back where I'm assuming the electrical cord was supposed to wrap around. The cord came in a plastic bag wrapped by a wire. I'm not even bothering with their customer service department if this is something they feel is acceptable to sell. It's going back!",

Lots of holes to climb in and out of. His socks were crispy after coming our of a regular washer and still dingy. This little machine gets his socks SOFT!!!!I LOVE the fact I can SEE how clear or dirty the rinse water is and I can get his clothes sparkling clean while STILL using less water!!!Yes, this little dynamo works well AND is great for the environment!!!Doing an average load...which is a third of my old regular load, I use about 12-16 gallons (depending on the dirtiness level where I can use one to 4 gallons to rinse).I have only used a regular washer during the last 9 months for a blanket which was too big for my little washer.10/10Thinking about buying another because it just works SO WELL and that means I could do it twice as fast.",

It\u2019s easy to use and not too heavy I use it in my bathtub and just put it away once I\u2019m done. The spin side also gets my clothes pretty dry too so if u don\u2019t have a dryer you should be able to hang dry them for a couple of hours and they should be dry. I invested also into the mini magic chef dryer and that\u2019s works wonders too!",
