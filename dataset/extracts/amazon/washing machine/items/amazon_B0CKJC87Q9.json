        "description": "Compact and Lightweight: This portable powerhouse weighs in at just 11 pounds, making it exceptionally easy to transport. Say goodbye to the hassle of lugging heavy laundry equipment around! Plus, its dimensions of approximately 16.54 x 9.06 x 16.93 inches when unfolded make it the perfect fit for any space, whether you're in a cramped apartment or on the go in an RV. When not in use, our washer folds up effortlessly, ensuring that it can be neatly stored away without taking up precious space in your home. When folded, it measures approximately 16.54 x 9.06 x 10 inches. Materials and Durability: Our washer is constructed using high-quality materials, primarily ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PP (Polypropylene). These materials are known for their durability and safety, ensuring that your washer is built to last. ABS and PP are resistant to impact, chemicals, and moisture, making them ideal choices for a portable appliance like this. Rest assured, your washer is designed to withstand the rigors of regular use while providing a safe and reliable laundry solution. Extra-Large Capacity: In addition to its convenient foldable design and impressive cleaning capabilities, our washer boasts an extra-large capacity when fully expanded. This means you can wash more clothes in a single cycle, saving both time and energy. With cycle times ranging from 2 to 10 minutes, you can easily customize your wash for optimal results. Important Information: To ensure the longevity and efficiency of your washer, please adhere to the recommended load capacity of 1 pair of jeans and a shirt, up to 5 shirts, or other combinations of clothes. Overloading the machine or using abrasive/corrosive cleaning agents can harm the washer's internal components. No Dryer Bucket Included: Please be aware that our washer is designed specifically for washing clothes and does not come with a dryer bucket. For drying, we recommend air-drying your cleaned clothing or using a separate drying method of your choice.",
