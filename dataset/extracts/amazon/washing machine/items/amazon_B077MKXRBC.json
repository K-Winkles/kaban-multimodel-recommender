We don\u2019t over fill it. 2 or 3 pair of pants max or 4 shirts washed separately. Especially if heavily soiled. If you put more you have to rewash the loads more. Be careful with it. This is my second time purchasing. Somehow the first one got a split in the hose and unfortunately if you don\u2019t purchase the warranty you\u2019re out of luck. I could never get support on the phone and we couldn\u2019t figure out how to replace the hose. But I still rate it a 5. The hose damage was likely one of my kids fault. They kept pushing the door into the hose.",

The machine I received wasn't damaged, but the shoddy construction work and ill-fitting lid meant there was plenty of space for water to escape. Water sloshed out between the lid and the side, and condensation on the inner side of the lid rolled down into the gap in the joint then outside the machine. While only half full, the spinning action still managed to shoot water out of the properly stored drain hose. After running it for about 5 minutes at only half capacity my countertop was soaked and I had to shut it off.Definitely spend your money on a better product! This thing is getting returned as soon as it dries off.",

It\u2019s perfect for my tiny apartment and I don\u2019t need wait in line to wash my clothes. It will probably wash a sheet from my queen size bed but not the comforter but that\u2019s ok. It is perfect for washing delicate silks and bras so I\u2019m very happy with it. The instructions made me laugh and worry a bit but found so videos online how to operate it and now it\u2019s a snap;)",

As for usefulness it\u2019s a 10/10 and it really works.Remember the1. hose it comes with it inside is what you use to put water in it or you can do it manually.2. The hose outside needs to be hanged up when you deposit or put water in it or else it will evacuate the container while you put water in it.3. Don\u2019t over fill the container with water it will spill and break.4. Don\u2019t over fill it with heavy clothes because the pulsator will break and have a hard time spinning, it is after all for light weight type of clothes or linens.5. Remember to clean it after and put it away neatly to make the life of it last.Now enjoy your new portable washer.",

                "reviewText": "First one came cracked so I sent it back and a new one came within a week. Tried it as soon as it came. It was a pain in the behind to use cause you have to manually fill it with water. The detachable hose was useless. Instructions say to choose between regular or gentle but couldn't find anything that lets you choose. To rinse you have to run the whole process again without soap. If you happen to put a little too much soap you will have to run it a third time to get it rinsed out well. There is no spin cycle so you have to ring out each item by hand. It would've been just as easy to hand wash my items in a bucket. If you expect this to do what a regular washer does then don't buy it. The only difference between using this and hand washing is the machine will do the washing otherwise everything else is like handwashing. Manual also says to ground the green wire but there was no green wire. By now I think you have a clear idea of what I think of this machine.",
