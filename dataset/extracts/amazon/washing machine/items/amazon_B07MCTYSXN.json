                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For a few years, I've been researching small, portable washers for our off-grid cabin (we have a generator, and I just purchased a portable power station and solar panel for charging it). I was so pleased to be able to get a power station with enough power for this machine! Before going to the cabin, I tried the system out at home, using a regular wall socket, but to the power station - worked fine. We just returned from a week at the cabin, and while there we had a leak that required mopping up some dirt and water with a bathmat - to try out the washer again, I put that, a pair of womens' lightweight pajamas, and several pairs of socks in for a wash. The capacity for washing and rinsing is impressive - it can hold a lot, but if the load is too heavy, the movement of the clothes is slowed down; I was surprised at how much agitation the little machine actually provides! And as you see in the picture, I used it on the deck, for excellent drainage. Instead of using the hose for filling, I just used a bucket - the filling hose and fitting for the faucet is the only thing about this system that is lacking at all - the \"adapter\" doesn't really allow for attaching to the faucet - you have to hold in place - once placed properly, it fills well. Or the bucket system works fine. :) So, since my bathmat was dirty, I increased washtime to 9 minutes. Then I removed the laundry while draining water, replaced the laundry, and added clean rinse water - rinsed for about 5 minutes, then drained again. I was able to split this load into two to fit in the spin basket, which was fine. The first, lighter load, spun without having to hold the machine; the second, heavier load required the machine being held (or one could place a heavy item on it). I spun for about 6 minutes each time, and of note - I'll do 8 -10 next time to get them even more dry. Amazing how much spin \"Little Junior\" (my brother named it! :) ) has!!! Onto a clothes rack in the sunshine and within a few hours all was dry, and the power station was fully charged again. This is a great little system - luxury off-grid!UPDATE: I've seen criticsm about the machine vibrating and moving - it's a lightweight machine, so to me this is expected. With the wash cycle, this isn't an issue at all, even with towels. With spin, it wiggles - please see pictures with the \"belt\" - a tie-down works great, as I do the laundry on the deck. For larger loads, the capacity is good for washing (I did towels: 3 bath, 3 hand, and 3 washcloths, no problem. I split that into 3 loads for spinning.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Powerful unit, but a bit of initial hassle",
                "reviewText": "I asked that this unit be sent discreetly since I am not allowed a washer in my apartment. I was assured the unit would be sent discreetly, but it came in a box clearly labeled \"washing machine\".I plugged the unit in and put one small washrag and filled the unit up with water to test a cycle. Oh my god it was so loud. I tried to put it in the styrophome it was packaged with but it was still super loud. I tried adding more water, less water, more rags. Nothing helped. Then I noticed under the unit was a TON of black powder. Black powder everywhere. All over my counter and floor. Any where I placed the unit, whenever I tried to move it to clean it, powder.I asked the company for a refund or new unit and provided pictures of the powder. I explained it was very loud, too, which seemed to contradict what most reviewers said.They first wanted me to keep my unit and refund me only a few dollars and asked me to try to sell the unit to make some of my money back. I explained the unit is basically not useable and didn't feel this was fair. The company eventually agreed to send me a new unit. I once again asked them to send the package discreetly. I explained I already asked last time to send the package discreetly and they didn't. They promised it would be sent discreetly. It wasn't. It was sent, AGAIN, in a box clearly labeled \"washing machine\". No discreet packaging. I have a very nosey neighbor and I was not home when the package arrived this time, so it was in plain sight for hours.However, the second unit worked really well. It's powerful and quiet. There was a minimal amount of black powder after the first wash, but after that it was fine. It takes a while to figure out how much soap you need to use.I don't even bother with the spin cycle, so my clothes are dripping wet when I go to hang them. I have to do everything over/in my tub (the unit fits fine in my tub). I learned that not having a dryer sucks. The clothes are so hard/stiff and take about two days to hang dry. This isn't the washer's fault, just something I did not take into consideration. I tried softners and vinegar, but did not help.It's a bit of a pain having to wait for it to fill with water, wait for a cycle to finish, wait for it to drain, wait for it to fill again, do another rinse cycle, etc, etc... It definitely does not save time. It does save money though. I spend about $40 a month going to the laundromat, so this paid for itself in about a month and a half.It's also convenient being able to run a load at home and to do small, frequent loads. I don't accumulate enough clothes in a week to necessitate a trip to the laundromat, but I go through cleaning rags like no tomorrow. This allows me to clean my rags every week at home while waiting for clothes to accumulate enough to go to the laundromat. This does a powerful job cleaning the rags.So, overall, I'm a little disappointed with the journey to get a working unit discreetly, but the unit itself works great once I got a good one.",

                "reviewText": "Ok this is not a \"full size washing machine\" so to compare it to a \"real\" washing machine isn't fair. I feel it's a good little machine for doing small or delicate items instead of washing by hand. Sometimes my son needs to wash A work shirt and I don't feel like doing a full load just for one thing, or for delicate items, it's great. Understanding that, and you'll be fine. HOWEVER what I didn't expect was, since there isn't an agitator in the middle, if you put a lot in there, everything gets tied up in knots which is annoying. So here's what I do. I do a few items, run it for 15 mins, drain, add clean water, rinse for another 10 mins then do the spin dry in the large washer in my house because if you try to do a spin in this thing it acts like it's going to launch into space. Don't run the spin it just can't stay balanced and rocks and rolls and WILL fall off the counter or fall over or whatever. I do like it. For what it is, it's great, just don't overload it, and add a LOT of water so stuff doesn't get all tangled up.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a good little machine and can do a reasonably good sized load. You can wash one sheet at a time which is pretty good for this little washer, but I only say this to let you know the capacity of the washer. I do take my sheets down to the laundry room because I find them too difficult to wring out before I put them in the spinner. The spin doesn\u2019t get as much water out of your clothes as a regular washer, but I just let the dryer run until they\u2019re dry so, for me, it\u2019s really not a problem.I included the pictures to show how I store and use it. I keep it in my bathtub with the pail and basin I put my washed clothes in to take to the dryer. This keeps everything handy. When I use the machine I put a mat under it because the spinner vibrates and the washer jumps around. To solve this, I just sit on the side of the tub, reading a book, and leaning my arm on the washer while it\u2019s spinning.To sum it all up, I would say this is a good machine for small loads and is very handy for apartment living.",
