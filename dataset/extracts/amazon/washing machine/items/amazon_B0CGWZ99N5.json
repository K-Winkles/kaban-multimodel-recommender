                "reviewText": "I needed a portable washing machine that was large enough to wash a fluffy, full size duvet cover and more than two towels at a time. The Nicetaw 17.8 lb washing machine has a very good capacity and was able to fit my fluffy duvet. The price for the Nicetaw was reasonable for the size and capabilities offered.The Nicetaw washing machine washed the items well, the rinse/ spin cycle drained the water and the soap efficiently Water levels are adjustable for each wash. Drain hose is attached to side of machine when draining. I do not have a designated space for the machine. I have to move it each time I use it, but it can be filled manually with a shower head or hose, which is easier for me than hooking it up to the faucet each time.Pros: Price and capacity. Save money on laundromat visits. It will pay for itself with the money saved. Included hardware for hook up. Can be filled manually. Has many washing options and water level controls.Cons: It is heavy and hard to move so a designated spot is ideal, No manual drain option. Draining pump is loud when draining. Loud beeps each time you press the selection buttons.Overall, it is a great option for apartments. The price is competitive for the options included and the capacity offered. It will enable me to clean my full sized duvet covers , quilts, towels and other heavy items without leaving home, and that was my goal.",

                "reviewText": "For apartments or other small spaces this is a very nice machine. The washer drum was surprisingly large, and can easily fit a week's worth of clothes. I find though that it works best when not overloaded and filled to the top, so I only ever fill clothes a little more than half way up, and Ill just wait to do a second load.Also, use LESS detergent than you think. More detergent does not mean cleaner, it just means your clothes will dry very stiff, and youre just wasting money. With this size, I never use more than the 2 Load mark on the detergent cap, and its works great. Add a little bit on vinegar to the first rinse cycle to really wash away any soap residue and clothes will be softer without tumble drying. The machine is quieter than expected, and has operated flawlessly. Very happy with this purchase, at a very good price! Will pay for itself in about 4-6 months I imagine, by avoiding the $15-20 at the laundromat every week.",

                "reviewText": "I chose this product after doing some research on different products, so I knew it was going to be a good one, but it is even better than what I expected! The size is perfect for apartments and dorm units, and it can even fit in a small closet despite that the machine has a pretty large capacity. The machine has 10 different modes (programs) with different washing/drying cycles; for instance, the \"Normal\" mode is 45 minutes and it washes the clothes for about 20 mins, then rinses them twice, and finally spins them to make them as dry as possible. The drainage works perfectly and I don't have any problems with draining from the machine to higher places. Moreover, the machine is not very heavy and can be moved pretty easily. It is also quiet and doesn't make too much noise.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
