I bought this to use in my apartment while I shopped for a deal on a washer/dryer combo. If you're low on space and don't mind hanging clothes to dry, this is a great option. The drain is gravity type, so you'll need to place it where the drain hose is level with, or below the machine. I placed mine in the tub when I used it and that worked perfectly.",
