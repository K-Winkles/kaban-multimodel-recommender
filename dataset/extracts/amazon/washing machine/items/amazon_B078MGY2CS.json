                "reviewText": "AMAZING! And I do not use that word lightly. I had to buy this in a panic when my portable washing machine gave out. I was two weeks deep in laundry in my apartment, which included the two wet loads. No time for a laundry mat run. I ordered this on a Sunday and it was at my door by Wednesday. I ran it all weekend to catch up on the back log and this little baby was like a hot knife through soft butter; ran like a dream! It got my clothes cleaner and brighter than my other machine that was twice its size and weight.No leaking faucet, so there is no water waste. I would caution folks to make sure that the waste water hose is secured so it doesn't fly out of the sink\u2013I learned that the hard way! I just took some old hand weights to help keep it in place, as I have to move it every week to hook up in my kitchen rather than having it permanently installed. I strongly recommend the four-wheel dolly to be able to move it around with ease, though it is also so so light (about 50 lbs). I was a skeptic but now can not say enough about this machine. So glad that I did not try and get another larger unit. This little baby takes all that I can throw at her. Bathsheets and bed sheets included. Got them cleaner and more lint extraction than when I had these items done by the professional dry cleaners laundry drop off.Also, the power of the spin cycle means that my air-dryed laundry is dry in a day\u2013A DAY folks! I have to air dry everything, towels included. I truly can not say enough about this investment. Don't let the affordability fool you. This little beauty earned her keep after the first weekend. The cycles are also really fast without skimping on cleaning. I also like that the top is see through so that I can assess if I need more soap or not. I will say that you need to do your laundry based on pounds rather thank items. The max is marked at eight pounds but again, don't let that low number fool you; it's more than it seems.Finally, it runs really quiet. My last machine was loud and had a very dramatic spin cycle. This little baby is quiet and gets the job done with no fuss. Because it is a drum there is more room to get more laundry in. The directions recommend putting small things like little socks and handkerchiefs in laundry bags. When the drum drops down, it would be easy for these small items to get spun out, so do make sure small items are secured.I hope this can help others with investing their hard earned money as well. It was and continues to be a life saver for me, and at a price point I can afford. Don't let the plastic encasing and hoses fool you. They are tougher than they appear. May your laundry needs be met by this machine and your stress be eased, just like mine was and continues to be.",

                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews but I hope this info helps you because it took me a couple of days of research to find the right parts to buy. I did not want to waste money or time and I was not familiar with plumbing acronyms.My Haier HLP23E portable washing machine finally gave up the ghost after 9 years. This machine has a smaller footprint and is shorter so takes up less space visually. I am 5' 3\" and it comes up to my hip. This model is lighter because the outside is plastic rather than metal. It has about 2/3 the capacity of the Haier. I won't be able to wash my thin duvet or quilted cotton coverlet in it. I wasn't supposed to wash those in the Haier either, but it handled the job.The electrical cord is thinner and provided plastic, inlet hose is much shorter. The hose does not work with my kitchen sink faucet. I tossed it.I can't move the machine easily so I stuck inexpensive furniture sliders under the legs and now it slides easily over the linoleum and into position at my kitchen sink for use. I did not want to spend more money on casters or a dolly.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W6Q4TM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1These are the parts I bought on Amazon to solve the hose issue. This set me back $26 including tax. I have Prime so delivery was free on these items. Everything arrived within 2 days of ordering except item #3 which was hard to find in plastic vs. brass. If Amazon sells out of item #3, try a store that sells irrigation connectors.1) Snap Coupling Adapter - This attaches to the faucet. It's convenient and there's less chance of stripping the threads of the faucet and the hose over time because half of it stays attached to the faucet.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GP9G860/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=12) Stainless Steel Braided Washing Machine Hose with Elbow - This works for me because I have a kitchen faucet that mixes the hot and cold water. I don't think it's necessary to get a hose with the elbow. The version without the elbow is about $2-3 less expensive.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IL681WO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=13) Nylon 3/4\" Male Garden Hose (MGH) x 3/4\" Female Pipe Thread (FPT) Adapter - This part took me the longest to figure out and find. It attaches to the machine and I'm hoping the fact that it's plastic will cause less wear and tear than a metal adapter. I intend to keep the inlet hose attached to the machine even when not in use. The nylon adapter hasn't arrived yet, but I will try to edit my review to post a picture. This part is necessary so that water doesn't leak from where the elbow attaches to the machine. Until the part arrives I have to baby the process by turning the faucet off in between filling the machine. One time I forgot and ended up with water all over my floor. It's a drag because, until I receive the part, I can't set it and forget it and multi-task effectively while doing the laundry.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LNKRD6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The washer operates at the same volume as the Haier except that the water pump to empty the washer is quite a bit louder. I'm very happy with the spin cycle as it leaves the clothes drier to the touch than the Haier. I line dry my laundry indoors with a folding rack I bought from IKEA and a clothesline. In the summer it takes almost a day for clothes to dry. In the winter and on rainy days, it can take 2 days to dry.Update 2/14/21: My parts arrived a few weeks ago. I needed to wrap 1/2\" wide Teflon/plumbers tape clockwise around the plastic pipe sticking up from the top of the machine before screwing on the adapter. That stopped the leaking *completely*. I've done about a dozen loads, including at full capacity and 8L water level, and the machine worked perfectly with no leaks. I didn't have to turn off the faucet between fillings or babysit the machine at all. This machine has a better spin cycle than my old Haier so leaves clothes drier to the touch and it's taken less time for them to dry on my drying rack. I am super pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I got this order a few days ago and I've been using it since. Most people will hook these up to their sinks and call it a day but I went a different route because a garden hose can be attached to it (if you use a female to female coupler). Which is nice for me because I have the space for it, but I don't have a hook up for laundry in my house. The system is delightfully simple to figure out and defaults to 4 liters of water used per wash cycle (and an additional 4 for rinse). Which means this thing runs nice and lean. Which is nice. So far I've washed comforters in it as well as a favorite backpack I use. You cannot dump large loads in. But you can run half sized loads no problem at all. For drainage, you can simply hang this out a window and do the job, or even run it into a drain. It's your call in that regard. So if you have a tap in your house that a regular garden hose is capable of fitting into, you can use that and a female connector to do the job.That's all.So far this has been a delightful thing for me who hates our local laundromats due to irregular hours and frankly questionable water supply.",

                "reviewText": "Ok from the start I was skeptical.That being said, this product has really surprised me. First off, very large metal washer tub, for its overall size. Having 10 different pre programmed settings is great, 7 different water levels 1-7 litres for varying sized laundry loads. It's a snap attachment to your faucet, like a portable dishwasher style, and the adapter already comes with, so you may not need another one aftermarket.And to top it off the drain hose is quite long, reaches across my bathroom to reach the tub no problem, the input water line is slightly short but no real issue there. No leaks, no vibrations thanks to rubber feet, and is overall non intrusive with noise.To boot there is a great lint trap built into the washing tub wall, clean every time you use.I've already had 4 people ask to share the link in Amazon so more sales coming.Buy, if you are looking for small washing machine and consider a roller bed stand for easy moving. 5 star happy customer!",

This very moment I'm washing bed linens, I could fit everything but the comforter in one load and still had room for a few hand towels and only using level 6 water (machine goes to level 8)If there was one complaint or caution for those who are off the grid and found this machine because of its size and low energy use...be ready as the water consumption is quite large. Each load (albiet large loads so fully loaded machine) on normal cycle (wash and rinse) is about 100 litres of water which seems excessive compared to standard full-size brands.I'm going to be playing around with the different settings to learn more about each ones consumption and cleaning power. I do still really like this machine for many other reasons (ease of use, size, weight, cleaning ability, portability, quiet) but the water usage seems high (nothing is leaking so it's not water loss).Final note I'll mention, many people in previous reviews complained how the connection to the water source leaked and they had to buy a totally new hose and attachment. This issue has been fixed as I noticed my unit came with a much different looking connection hose than those who provided feedback on units purchased previously so the manufacturer has been listening.",

I would highly recommend getting a trolley with wheels however I just put in onto a small rug and slide it across the floor to my sink and works perfectly.I went from loathing laundry to practically begging my son to bring his laundry home just so I can use my new washing machine.
