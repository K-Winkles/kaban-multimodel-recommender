                "reviewText": "I am surprisingly impressed with this little machine. I recently moved into an apartment that has a laundry room but I needed to purchase and install my own which I wasn\u2019t totally into the idea I thought I\u2019d just find a local laundry mat. Well that turns out to be difficult with two small kids so I started looking into portable machines and found this one. First of all it does not wash a lot all at once you do need to do small loads. So be aware but personally it works for what my family needs. It\u2019s fast and gets things clean as a regular washer. The dryer though is what blew me away I was SURE the clothes would still be soaking wet but they come out nearly dry. I hang them on a drying rack for maybe half an hour and they\u2019re good to go! Still getting the hang of how much to put in the washer if I wanna dry it all at once the dryer is a smaller barrel. But it only takes 5 minutes so slipping up the load isn\u2019t a huge deal at least to me. I would also suggest wringing out the clothes before putting them into the dryer. I leave the drain on as I\u2019m wringing them out so all the dirty water is gone before my next load. Highly suggest if you\u2019re looking for something effective and cost efficient. Would not suggest for larger families it will take forever lol.",

                "reviewText": "I love this little washing machine. I live in a studio apartment on the 2nd floor and was a bit tired of hiking to the laundry mat every two weeks with 5 loads of clothes. A friend informed me about this small washer and I decided to try it out. It does an excellent job in getting my clothes clean. And the spinner is amazing. It really wrings all the water out. At times the washer side does not drain all the way so the clothes are sometimes really wet. But the spinner can handle and rings all of the water out.I watched a you tube video before purchasing and one of the tips provided was to place a stocking on the end of the hose for draining to catch most of the lint. That works like a charm. I do all of my washing inside of my bath tub because I don't want any water mishaps. It works perfect for me. I use my shower hose to fill it up and use a very small amount of detergent. I place the clothes in and turn on the timer. Once finished I drain then do one more cycle to rinse usually at a lesser amount of time. Then place items in the spinner. And I'm done.I love this machine and recommend to anyone who lives in a small space. I also use the dryer for my nicer items because hanging them to dry does not remove the wrinkles. The washer will also accommodate queen size sheets. I wash one in with a few towels and the other one I may wash with a few clothes so not to over load the washer. There needs to be room for the clothes to be moved around otherwise they don't get as clean.Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "Edit: originally when we received the unit the washer and dryer did not spin. This was something to do with our apartment, not the unit itself. A friend who has the same unit was able to help us troubleshoot the issue and we were able to wash our first load. In addition the unit being extremely light, it is very efficient. The clothes do get pretty dry and they seem to be very clean. We have only used it once so it isn\u2019t fair to give a full review but after the first use, given that it continues to work as it did during the first use, I would recommend this portable washer. We are very excited and pleased to have this product.We received the washer today and unfortunately the washer nor the dryer would spin. I was really excited about this portable washer because my husband and I live in an apartment with shared coin laundry and we are expecting our first baby so to be able to do laundry in our space and not have to get coins (or find them right now with COVID and the coin shortage) just seemed like a dream. Very disappointed to have received a unit that doesn\u2019t work, we will be returning the unit. Hopefully all goes well with the return.Hopefully our situation was a rarity as the other reviews seem pretty positive though I know it seems that others have also Had similar issues.One pro that my husband and I noticed right away is that the unit is pretty light. It also seems like it would be easy to use if ours would spin.",

                "reviewText": "I'm writing this after using just once. I had one of a different brand before and it lasted almost 5 yrs. I'm hoping for the same here esp after reading about customer service in the reviews. My old one held 10 lbs so you can imagine how exciting the size of this is to me. Its almost as big as a reg washer! So far so good. This is not an automatic machine therefore you do have to do a bit more work but its not too hard and wonderful to be able to throw a load in before bed and have clean dry clothes in the morning. I use my handheld shower to fill. Seems to drain well. Not too noisy. Cord is short so I'm using an extension. I didn't even bother trying the sink hose, it really is a silly waste of material. I'm using it to extend the drain hose. The spinners ok, not as good as my old one but thats OK because I have a ninja soft spinner, highly recommend if they still have them. Seems to clean really well. Light weight, not huge. So far with fingers crossed I like it! The size really kills me lol.",
