                "reviewText": "Working for me! Small, light weighted, easy to carry around! I have a house but my bulky washer is on the 2nd floor, making it inconvenient to carry all the clothes upstairs. Also the washer is pretty bulky and I have to hand wash a lot of clothes which needs daily care (underwear) or immediately care (like my daughter's pants from potty accidents). With this, it's much easier and feels energy saving to wash clothes whenever and wherever needed! However, don't expect it to be as efficient as the bulky washer -- the twisting speed is more gentle and slow, and wouldn't really get rid of hard stains or deep marks like those left by color pens. It's more a little machine to save on the labor work.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Cute, clever and sort of compact to carry - but it has a few flaws. Still, it may be a good thing to add to an RV for long travel plans.It passes the test of washing 3 grandkid-trashed cloth placemats (extreme filth!!). Rinsing was a second pass with plain water.I tried the \"wringer\" basket too. One placemat at a time. My conclusion is that hand-wringing works better and faster. The unbalance dance this little bucket washer did while spinning the single place mat was pretty extreme for the little bit of water that it extracted. One other note about the wringer basket - the rest of the washer folds fairly flat, but not this basket, causing storage issues. The drain plug is a bit finicky to re-seat, and all of the water doesn't seem to drain out through the exit port, even when tilted.The manual is good for a laugh. No useful information there, though. Translations issues, mostly.It plugs in to wall voltage, but only to produce \"12 VDC\" (14 VDC really) which is human-safe for around water. Also, a little electronics work easily can make a direct plug for a car cigarette lighter or RV 12 volt system.It's a little noisy, with squeaky motor noises as it labors. The unit shakes around quite a bit, as it has no weight to hold it still.Finally, I think it's a bit overpriced.",
