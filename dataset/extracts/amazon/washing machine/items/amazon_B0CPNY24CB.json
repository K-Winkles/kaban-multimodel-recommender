                "reviewText": "Took me about 3 months to finally order a portable washer, spinner. Read all reviews, read all I could find and watched videos on them before I decided on this one. It only had 2 reviews but they were both good and also mentioned long hoses and low noise level. Got here very fast, spent the day using it. Put it in the tub and use a bucket to fill it and it drains well in the tub. Was concerned about it being heavy to lift, but it's not at all. Holds a lot, 3-4 jeans, load of sheets, small load of shirts n stuff. The only con I have is clothes get twisted together during wash, but easy fix, I use a big mesh bag to keep that from happening with perm press clothes. The spinner truly does a great job of almost completely drying, so much better than I imagined. Both are very quiet. If the spinner makes noise, rearrange clothes to level them out and don't try spinning a lot at once. It's only 5 mins, that's all that's needed. Other brand reviews talked about being noisy and short hoses, big reason I chose this one. So easy to use and the included lint catcher, just throw in washer, works great. I'm really very happy with it, although it was my first time using it but used it all day catching up on laundry. I don't foresee any problems, very well made, does not look cheaply made at all. I don't write many reviews, usually nothing to shout about, but I do highly recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "Super fast shipping, arrived much sooner than expected & arrived in perfect condition. The hinges on the plastic lids are a little too strong and can bend the plastic; if you\u2019re not careful, you might break it. Just make sure to lift the lid with care and try to not be too reckless where the hinges are & you should be fine. So far, it works amazing, I will update should anything go wrong, but I don\u2019t believe it will. I\u2019m very happy with how it works and the spinner definitely dries your laundry very well! It\u2019s pretty quiet & not very noisy, even when spinning. The hoses were perfect & long. Everything came packaged neatly & it was super easy to set up & lift inside or lift anywhere. I will see how it puts up these next few months. :) I Would definitely consider buying this if you\u2019re looking for a small, portable washing machine. It doesn\u2019t take up much space at all & is great for a top floor unit as well. 10/10",

                "reviewText": "UPDATED: 1/17/2024 -- My wash timer seems to only want to go as far as 12 minutes, not the full 15 minutes. I've tried re-positioning the dial handle on the spindle but the travel around the dial only seems to want to go 4/5 of the way around. Has anyone else experienced this?I may review again after more usage, but first impressions are great. It has satisfied all my needs. The washer side works well, and the spin side does really get the load 80-90% dry, as many have said. I'm still learning how much water to use, how much detergent to use, etc. I run a rinse cycle with vinegar rather than any fabric softner (a habit from my wife). I'm going to look at alternative detergents, and maybe even dryer sheets, just for that fresh washed smell.CONS: The fill tube is useless even with my faucet, so I have ordered one of the pet washing hoses with a stretchable connector to my bathroom sink faucet that I am using. Also, the floating lint catcher is useless as it keeps coming apart on every load. I will be looking for an alternative lint collector.",
