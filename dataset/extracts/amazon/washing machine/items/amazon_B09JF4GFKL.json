                "reviewText": "Now that we have had this machine for a couple of months and washed a decent amount of laundry I feel confident writing this review. We don't have a laundry facility in our building so we needed a small machine that could wash and keep up with baby laundry. After doing much research we landed on this one and I'm glad we did!Overall it's a great machine, but it's not perfect.Pros:- VERY lightweight and maneuverable. It's very easy to carry around different rooms of your house; use it in 1 room and store it in another.- Gets clothes very clean. I spot treat any stains and this little washer gets pretty much every stain out.- The spin cycle really removes a lot of water. 5 minutes in the spin cycle and then another 15-20 minutes of hang drying and the clothes are pretty much ready to be folded and put away.Cons:- It's small. It initially looks bigger but it's very easy to overload the machine. It takes a few loads to figure out how much you can really wash at once. If the machine makes a weird noise, you have overloaded the machine.- The spin cycle works so well that delicate clothes may get damaged. I started putting the more delicate items in mesh laundry bags and that helps a lot!- Washing one load takes a few steps and is quite hands on. Every step is really simple, but you need to go through a wash cycle, rinse cycle and spin cycle. For the wash and rinse cycle you need to manually add and then drain the water. And for the spin cycle you need to move your laundry from the machine into the spin basket.What we can wash in 1 load (these are separate loads that we've tried and they don't overload the machine and the items come out squeaky clean):- Around 10 baby outfits (onesies, pants and tops or footed pajamas, or any fabric item that is approximately the same size)- 1 queen size sheet- 4 crib sheets- 8 muslin blankets- 3-4 large fleece blankets- lots of adult underwear and socks!Overall this is a great machine! It does exactly what it needs to do and it's perfect for our small space. Because of the size and the multiple steps to do a load of laundry it does not replace a full size machine, but that shouldn't be expected anyways. We are very happy with our purchase!",

                "reviewText": "So far I've loved using the Drop. I've washed my 2 year old granddaughters clothes, my t shirts (4), socks, u derwear, wash clothes, all washed seperate loads. Clothes are clean. This helps me from having to carry so much downstairs to laundry room.Cons: drain hose clip should be further down and hose a little longer because water sometimes comes out. Power cord could be longer. Size is good but a little bigger would be great.Loving this so far. I've used 6 times.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It's a cute little washing machine, but it makes a huge amount of noise during the wash cycle. I don't think it's normal at all. I'm going to probably send it back. It washes well but whatever is making that noise you hear in the video I've attached can't be good for the longterm viability of this machine. I put a t-shirt in to wash just for this video because you can't hear the noise this thing makes in the advertising video the company put out. Perhaps I got a poorly assembled machine. I've contacted the seller for a solution. If I don't get one, it's going back.Update: Laundry alternative is a great company for their customer service. I contacted them and they immediately sent me another machine. They stand by their products and again their customer service is stellar. Customer service is very important to me and I would buy from them again.Final update: So here's what happened. I was sent a second washing machine as stated above. That machine after using it was quite and it washed very well. However it had a leak, and you won't believe this but Laundry Alternative sent me another machine. This final machine is working perfectly. No metallic rattling sounds, no leaks, and it's quite. What's happening is they were being damaged in shipping. It's not the product itself, and although they are packed well it seems the shipping company doesn't care how they handle the packages. My last machine was just laying on its side, and wasn't placed all the way under my porch awning and it was raining. The package was wet but luckily my machine was fine. Laundry alternative is a great company, and I will buy from them again.",

                "reviewText": "I know several reviews complained about water leaking problem. I think they fixed the issue. Because in this one package I received, in addition to a white plastic drain hose which leaks water everywhere, there's a new rubber like gray hose which is twice as long and with the end attaches to the drain opening deeply and securely - no leak at all!The spin dry feature works surprisingly well - clothes comes out close to a regular washer. The wash and rinse features work well as well.",
