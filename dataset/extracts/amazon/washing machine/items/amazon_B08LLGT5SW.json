                "reviewText": "I LOVE this washer! My machine arrived in perfect condition. It was very easy to set up, came with everything including the faucet adaptor for the quick connection water hose. You definitely need a washing machine dolly if you plan to move it from it's storage location to the sink- the 2 wheels under the machine are not adequate for rolling/maneuvering the machine. Once on the dolly, the machine is very stable and stays in place during the entire washing process, even during long spin cycles. It's very quiet, I don't think neighbors would be able to hear it, even downstairs neighbors. My clothes come out just as clean as a regular washing machine even using only cold water. I suggest using a wire mesh strainer over your sink drain to catch the lint, quite a lot of large lint pieces come out the drain hose and could clog pipes.This 3.0 cubic ft machine is quite large, it fits in my coat closet for storage. It's too big for my small bathroom but fits fine in the kitchen. The tub is large enough to wash a good-sized load of clothing, towels or bed linens. I can fit a \"summer weight\" down alternative queen comforter in there but a thicker comforter would not fit. I specifically bought this size machine so I would be able to wash my Queen bedding, I solved the thick comforter problem by switching to 2 \"summer weight\" comforters inside my queen duvet cover for winter (you still get all the warmth and fluffy thickness) so each comforter can be washed separately. Heavy faux fur throw blankets and bathroom rugs fit fine and wash beautifully.You only need a very small amount of detergent, 2 TBSP or 1 pod is plenty. If I have heavily soiled items, I soak them in very hot water with some oxy clean and detergent in the sink for a few hours then throw them straight into the washer, no need to wring them out. I haven't figured out any way to use the soak feature with hot water yet. This machine uses barely any electricity and a small amount of water (about the same amount of water as a shower) The wash cycles are quite long but I don't really mind. The small inconveniences drastically outweigh the hassle of taking clothing to a laundromat or having to use a community laundry room.I'm very happy with this machine. If you're on fence about it, just GET IT. It will save you money and time.",

                "reviewText": "This machine is really great for the money. It\u2019s a little bit bigger than I expected but it\u2019s pretty quiet and it cleans my clothes really well. I would suggest tying the hoses together because the output hose slipped off the edge of my counter and made a little bit of a mess. Tying them together fixed the issue. Also the rollers on the bottom don\u2019t really work well on carpet so I\u2019d recommend to get some 3M sliders a little bit oversized for the feet. Once you do that slides really nicely and is a lot easier to move around. It also comes with all of the hoses and adapters that you need to hook it up so that was really helpful.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very pleased",
                "reviewText": "I have had this washer for just over 2 months now and I am well pleased with it. I did my research on different washing machines (that can be used without hookups) beforehand and decided on this one in part because of the warranty and the brand. It works well, simply no issues there. The way it washes seems a little strange, as it will swish the clothes around for maybe 1-2 min, then stop for 1-2 min. It still washes my clothes well. It is smaller than a typical washing machine of course and can't hold as many clothes. The spin cycle gets them dry enough that when I leave them on a drying rack indoors, they dry usually in about 24 hrs.It is not that loud, although that wouldn't really be an issue. You can hear the water swish in the machine, you can hear the sink when its filling with water, you can hear water rushing out when it drains, and you can hear the motor working to make the clothes move, although I'd say that's the same noise level as the water swishing as the clothes move.I live in a pretty small apartment with no hookups and wanted to save money from not going to the laundromat and I wanted the comfort of doing laundry in my own home. I fully recommend this machine. I have already saved more money than I would have spent at the laundromat. My setup has my washer in the bathroom with the inlet hose connected to the sink and the drain hose also draining into the same sink. I have them connected with a rubber band so the drain hose stays in place. Figuring out how to attach the inlet hose to a sink took a little while, but I had to take the water aerator off the bathroom sink and then it was able to attach with the attachment it came with. There are issues people have mentioned that I would like to address.Someone said the spin cycle on normal is set to 55 min and it seems to be a mistake in the programming. Mine initially said this too, but after my first use, it now says 5 or 9 min, depending on the cycle.Other people have mentioned that the washer will start draining water out of the drain hose before the water level is filled up enough, or if you use a bucket. I believe the issue there is the drain hose is not elevated high enough. It seems kind of weird, but if the drain hose is only raised high enough to drain into the bathtub for example, I had the same issue where the water would start draining before it filled to halfway (or if I added more from a bucket). Then, I raised my drain hose higher to drain into the bathroom sink, which is just about the same height as the washer, and now it fills almost to the brim and doesn't drain water prematurely. The manual says the drain hose needs to be elevated to about 34 inches high for this reason I'm sure.In case people don't read the manual or notice, there is a little filter on the inside wall of the washer which needs to be cleaned about every 10 washes or once a week or something like that. Its a little net that fills with lint and is very easy to clean.",

It washes very well and its centrifuge is great, at the end of the wash the clothes are just damp, without much water. I almost gave up on the purchase because the seller has no information about the size and thickness of the faucet connector that comes with the machine and I didn't know if it would be easy to plug into my faucet. But yes, the connector fit on every faucet in the house. I took a tape measure and took a picture and put it on top of the connector that came with the machine. It's not that perfect, but I hope it helps other people who have the same question. The tape measure is in centimeters",

                "reviewText": "Har\u00e9 una rese\u00f1a con funcionamiento o usos.Apenas la tengo por 3 d\u00edas y ya la us\u00e9 7 veces. Eso s\u00ed, tard\u00f3 casi un mes en enviarse (Amazon Internacional Standard) desde la fecha de compra. Aproximadamente 20 d\u00edas. El env\u00edo s\u00f3lo fue de 2 d\u00edas.Las medidas de profundidad contando la manguera de desag\u00fce es de 48cm, la medida de ancho con espacios laterales recomendados es de 45cm y la altura es de 78cm.Es decir, una ves que la abres y sacas de la caja, es muy bonita y da ternura por lo compacta. Pero esa es su ventaja.Las cargas habituales que realice fueron de :15 boxers talla M, o 5 a 7 playeras talla M o G, o 2 pantalones de mezclilla talla 32.No la llenes a m\u00e1s de 3/4 de ropa seca.Detergente se recomienda usar los que tienen el logo \"he\" high efficiency (alta eficiencia). En mi caso recomiendo el detergente mexicano \"Newen\" de venta tambi\u00e9n en Amazon. Ya que es biodegradable y concentrado (alcanza a lavar bien con una a tres cucharadas 10 a 30ml) en lugar de los detergentes comerciales que usas tapas de m\u00e1s de 100ml. A\u00fan as\u00ed en las instrucciones se recomienda usar la mitad de lo que dicen los envases.En cuanto a ruido, es muy silenciosa incluso durante el centrifugado.Respecto a las conexiones, los aditamentos con los que viene, fueron suficientes para conectarla a la llave del lavabo. Viene con dos gomitas dentro de la conexi\u00f3n r\u00e1pida. Dependiendo si es para rosca interna o externa se pone o se quita el empaque superior.La manguera del desag\u00fce, TIENE QUE ESTAR POR ENCIMA DEL NIVEL DE AGUA DE LA LAVADORA, es decir, si la dejas en el suelo, jam\u00e1s se va a llenar.Tiene varios modos de lavado. \u00danicamente el modo Pesado (Heavy), Gentil (Gentle) y Remojar (Soak) te dejan modificar todos los par\u00e1metros de lavado. El modo Normal y R\u00e1pido s\u00f3lo permite cambiar nivel de agua y n\u00famero de enjuagues.El lavado (Wash) se puede seleccionar hasta 20min, se pueden seleccionar hasta tres enjuagues (Rinse) y hasta 9min de centrifugado (Spin). Cualquiera de estos tres par\u00e1metros se pueden omitir al dejarlos en 0.El modo r\u00e1pido tarda 15min y el modo m\u00e1s tardado 88/90min.El atrapa pelusa en verdad funciona.No tengo ninguna queja al respecto. Si acaso el tiempo de env\u00edo y el costo que se paga por importaci\u00f3n (va inclu\u00eddo en el precio).Si esta lavadora se vendiera en M\u00e9xico costar\u00eda $1,200 pesos menos es decir entre $5,500 a $6,100 pesos. Que bien lo valen.En verdad recomiendo la lavadora.Como extra les recomiendo comprar un codo a 90\u00b0 para la manguera de llenado y quede m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda la conexi\u00f3n en la lavadora.Har\u00e9 actualizaci\u00f3n al mes o 3 meses, a ver qu\u00e9 tal va.Ha pasado un mes, y todo funciona perfectamente, igual que el primer d\u00eda. El modo de lavado \"Pesado\" es mi favorito, el cual personalizo en cada lavada. Recomiendo usar jab\u00f3n Persil.",
