The pull tab for the zipper will last longer than the big-box guys, as it already has. Lower quality zipper pulls come off in the first wash. This one didn't, thanks to an ingenious elastic that covers the pull tab when the zipper is closed.It's a useful addition to my laundry repertoire.",

Someone has to stand next to it, holding it down, or the clothes would come out during the spinning step. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It is good for washing a few, lightly dirty, items at a time.If you have size 3XL items, the guide on the site is NOT accurate. We put one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and a camisole in it, size 3XL. I wouldn't want to put too much more in it. Those items are overflowing the spinner basket.It moves a LOT during the spin cycle.It does not come with good directions. It doesn't say how much soap to use. It doesn't say if the spinner basket should be installed during washing, or only during the \"dehydrate\" cycle. It doesn't have cleaning directions. It doesn't say how high to fill the water.The cord is pretty short, so it needs to be near a plug. Which wouldn't be a problem, except it wiggles a bunch and water spills out the sides, so we use it in the kitchen sink, and there is not a plug close enough without an extension cord.There is a little notch on the back of the bucket to hang the drain hose on, which is convenient.I also really like the drying hanger with clips.It spins for a bit, then stops and switches directions. We washed with the basket inside, which made a decent agitator. I was also very careful not to overload it.The motor is pretty noisy.The hose that is supposed to connect to the faucet doesn't connect to any of mine, but it wasn't a problem because the entire thing is already in the sink anyway because it splashes so much.The items we put in were VERY dirty. I put it through a 5min wash before I figured out how to access the other cycles, then a 10min wash, both with soap. The clothes still stunk. So I did a 5min cycle with baking soda and let it soak for half an hour. The water was brown, so I drained it and rinsed it out and ran another 5min cycle with baking soda and let it soak again. It was still pretty brown, but I drained and rinsed it, then ran a 10min wash with soap, which left the water still a bit brown, but definitely not as bad. Then another 10min soap wash, then finally a rinse cycle (just water). I used hot water for everything.It CAN get very dirty items clean, but they need soaking, and you have to run it multiple times, which requires you to drain and refill it a lot.We bought it for use mainly for period underwear, and it will work perfectly for that.",
