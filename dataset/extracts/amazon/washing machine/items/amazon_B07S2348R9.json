                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Amazing that FedEx delivered it early. The box was padded with Styrofoam, and the machine itself is incredibly light weight. It is a decent size, good for small spaces if you have the right space for it. There's two water intake valves, one on either side, and although the intake hose fits the machine, it does not fit any faucets in the house and you'd have to sit and hold it there and wait for it to fill up. A shower hose works well. It does become a decent bit heavier once the water is added so I'd recommend having it in the spot you want before filling it. I would recommend buying an extension cord because the power cord is rather short, and may not reach an outlet from the spot you want the machine. For me, unfortunately, the best spot for the machine was on top of my toilet, the only reason being that the drain is gravity based. As I said, earlier, it's a decent size but having the right spot is going to be hard. I used a tide pod for my first load, just because that's what I have. It appears to be the right amount of soap. After the wash cycle you are going to have to drain out that dirty water and refill it with clean water for the rinse. After the rinse cycle, be prepared to do your dry load in portions, the dryer isn't big but it is very very fast and efficient.Some downsides, to buying but it's mostly just placement. Otherwise it's basically exactly what I was looking for; a nice easy way to do laundry inside my apartment without having to walk and pay at the laundromat.Update:I used it for a few days and realized that the washer wasn't spinning the way it was supposed to, which I noticed a few other people had mentioned in their reviews. I did some digging into the machine and I found the issue, the belt inside the machine was not on all the way. I put the belt on and tightened all of the nuts and bolts to make sure nothing else could come undone. Hasn't had an issue since and all I had to do was remove the back panel.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this is a really great product. It\u2019s compact and it gets your clothes extremely clean - just as clean as if you were using a regular size washer. There are a few things that they could improve upon and that I\u2019d wish I\u2019d known before I bought the product but I would definitely buy again. First of all the instructions are very poorly translated so here is how you actually use the washer \u2013 which is very helpful to know before buying the product because it\u2019s not exactly the type of product you can load the clothes in and then just leave for its entire wash cycle. There are a few steps that you have to go through when washing. The left side has what would be the agitate side. You load your clothes in that side and fill with water \u2013 I usually get the water level just above the clothes level and there are some max fill lines. You then add in the detergent & know that you only need a little bit of detergent \u2013 the first time I washed clothes I put too much and it was very sudsy. If you have the type of cap on your liquid detergent that has the lines on it I would use no more than level 1 line for a full load. You then close the lid and start your first round of washing \u2013 you can wash for up to 15 minutes and I always put it on the 15 minute mark. You can then abandon it until it\u2019s time to drain. You will then need to drain into a tub or sink all of the water and then you move your clothes over to the right side which is the spin cycle. The spin side is smaller than the agitate side so unless you\u2019re doing a small load you will need to spin your clothes in two rounds and you can spin for up to five minutes, which I always do. After spinning you move the clothes back to the left side and add in clean water but no detergent and run through what would be the rinse cycle - Again, you can run this side up to 15 minutes and I always do it at 15 minutes. You then drain the water into the tub or sink again and move your clothes back over to the right side for the final spin which, again, you will most likely need to do inntwo rounds. When I bought this I thought the spin side was actually a dryer but it is not. It does however spin a lot of water out so smaller items like underwear or sports bras or lighter weight clothing will get quite dry. You can then load your clothes into a dryer if you have one or onto a drying rack to complete the drying process. You will also need to drain one last time after the final spin because you will have spun a lot of water out and you can hear it sloshing around inside. A note when draining \u2013 make sure you always hook the drain pipe back on the side of your washer before moving it because the water will drip out and it does come out in a big rush. So here\u2019s where we get to the one of two major problems with the washer. The drain pipe is on the bottom left side of the agitate side (when facing it) so unless you have a standup shower you need to have the washer elevated to drain it because it can\u2019t go from the bottom of the washer, up the side of the tub, and back down into the tub to drain. That would defy gravity lol! And even if you have a standup shower, like I said, the water does come out in a big rush so you risk flooding your shower as it drains. My toilet is located next to my tub so my boyfriend and I would lift the washer onto the toilet lid to drain it but this is not the most lightweight of washers and when you add in clothes and water it is extremely heavy and there aren\u2019t really any handles on the side to lift it up. So my boyfriend build me a wooden stand on wheels because I have to move my washer from the guest bedroom into the bathroom because my bathroom is too small to store it. So keep that in mind that you may want something on wheels \u2013 also, most outlets are not located next to the tub so unless you get an extension cord you would need to move it from where it\u2019s plugged in over to a tub to drain so having it on wheels makes it much easier. And the stand that he built is high enough that the washer can sit on it and drain into the tub perfectly. I just leave it on the stand all the time since I have to wheel it about. The second major problem is that the tube that it comes with to fill up the washer is just a thin plastic tube and it is not one that hooks onto the faucet. You either have to stand there holding it onto the faucet so the water doesn\u2019t spray everywhere or forgo the tube and use a watering can or I used my Brit\u2019s filter to fill it up. So neither of those options are the most efficient or pleasant! We bought a short garden hose from Amazon that was maybe $5 and it has a rubber end on one end that you fit onto the faucet head and then the metal end on the other side that you stick into the washer and it works perfectly to fill up the washer. And the best part is you can leave it while it fills up and do something else \u2013 just make sure you set a timer because I\u2019ve definitely overflowed it before when I forgot about it! It takes about five minutes to fill up a full load. So all that being said, it is a great washer and really gets your clothes clean but just know that you may want to do some measuring and buy a couple extra components to make it the most efficient.",

                "reviewText": "We live in a VERY small place and are tired of going to the laundromat. We ordered this! Light weight enough to move around. We make sure to not overload the washer or spinner but this works for us! It's just the 2 of us so we aren't doing gobs of laundry anyways. The whole unit sits inside our bathtub for now. We bought a drying rack so we could hang our clothes outside to dry. When it rains, i suppose we can put the rack under our deck area or we put an extra shower curtain rod in the shower area and hopefully they will hang dry relatively quickly. Next spring or summer we will move the washer onto a patio outside our small shed area. This uses less soap and takes us less time to do laundry now. In the future we might invest in a small dryer as this unit just spins the water out of the clothes and does a pretty good job. So far so good, no problems with this little washer/spinner!",

The hose should be upgraded to fit a standard size water tap. I also would find it easier to move around it it was on wheels.",
