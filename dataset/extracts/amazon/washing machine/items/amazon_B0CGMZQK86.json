                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this mini washer with the hopes for using it to clean my mop heads and dust rags.Pros: The setup is easy and the square design along with the suction cups prevent the item from tipping over during the wash and spinThe foldable design makes it great for storage.It does wash your items just not as well as regular washer which shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. I would probably run the wash cycle 3 times before considering it clean. Still it\u2019s a nice compact option to have.Cons: I don\u2019t know who thought it was a good idea to have the plug next to the drain hose. It should have atleast been put on the side. Additionally the plug doesn\u2019t plug in all the so there is a bit of the metal exposed. Having this next to a water drainage hose made me nervous.Spin cycle doesn\u2019t work. Theres a basket you\u2019re suppose to clip in and then when you select \u201cdehydrate\u201d it\u2019s suppose to spin that basket with your clothes. Issue is the basket keeps unclipping and falling off of the base. In the end you\u2019re better off hand wringing your clothes. I\u2019ve played around with using 1 then 2 microfiber mop cloths and it didn\u2019t make a difference.Plastic used doesn\u2019t seem all that great. Best way I can describe it is you know when you get a product and the plastic seems as if it\u2019s just been cut as in it wasn\u2019t primed properly prior to being packaged. It\u2019s like that still plastic hairs at sites. Additionally the plastic itself is on the cheaper side. My lid on the washer couldn\u2019t shut all the way because the plastic wasn\u2019t bent at an angle in a way to allow it fit in the hole.Instructions aren\u2019t great so I\u2019d just YouTube videos of how to use any of these mini washers",

The spin basket kept coming off even if I clicked it on to the spinner. I place 1 wash towel and 2 but basket kept coming off.As for the rinse, you have to rinse it yourself.In total, it would have been faster to use the small cycle on the regular washing machine. I gave it a one star only because it wouldn\u2019t allow me to give it NO star!!!!",
