                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very Effective For Certain Things",
                "reviewText": "I live in a 400 sqft studio and use this to cut laundry costs. (Our dryers are huge and effective, but our washing machines are dirty and tiny. AND they cost the same as a dryer load, but fit 1/3 as much stuff.)Background info: I live alone and there's a lot of cat hair on stuff. I also sew and prep a lot of fabric. I do MANY loads of laundry twice a month. This thing basically is working constantly for a full 10 hours on laundry day (minus soaking time).I set this directly on my tub floor and fill it with my handheld showerhead. I wash and drain, spin, refill to rinse, and spin again.Things I like:-Good capacity, even for the dryer. I can fit a twin-sized matelasse bedspread or a full-sized linen blanket in the spin dryer (as long as there's nothing else in there and I let some water run out before putting it in). I spin it for 4 minutes, and I set it aside until I collect enough stuff to fill up a building dryer. (I do these items separately in the washer as well.)NOTE: THESE ARE SINGLE LAYERS. As in NO QUILTING! If you've got quilted stuff to clean, it better be a baby blanket.-I can do one set of full-sized sheets OR a full-sized duvet cover in one load.-2-3 standard bath towels, 6-8 wash cloths, and like 4 hand towels is 1 washer load and 2 dry cycles (my stuff doesn't tend to be TERRIBLY thick though). I spin the towels for 4 minutes and set aside.-Stripping laundry is SUPER easy. Fill, soak for however long in the detergent soup, then run the washer.-The lint netting catches a decent amount of cat hair and lint.-More powerful motors than the Della \u200e048-GM-48216 (Auertech: 460w/180w versus Della: 300w/140w.)-I have successfully run both the washer and spin dryer at the same time (though only for a minute or so).Things I thought would be an issue but aren't:-Gravity drain. Turns out the washer drains just fine when placed directly on my tub floor. I didn't need additional elevation at all. I don't even miss the pump in my old Della.-Not as much capacity as my old Della twin tub (048-GM-48216).Frankly, I'm still calling this a win even with the reduced capacity. While the chamber VOLUMES are smaller, the motors are rated for more laundry weight. So yes, the twin-sized matelasse bedspread fit more easily in the Della, it also strained the dryer motor. With the Auertech, I have to let some of the water run out, then squish it down a bit, but the dryer is handling it like a champ (thus far).-No 'Gentle' setting for the washer. As a substitute, I shorten the agitation time and soak longer.Overall, I'm SUPER happy with this. Even when I have a traditional washer/dryer setup, I may still keep one of these on hand--they're nice for teeny loads, for laundry stripping, for emergencies, or maybe even for items you don't necessarily want touching your regular machine.And it's even better because now I have ALL KINDS of apartment options when I move to my next place.",

                "reviewText": "This washer broke on me within two weeks and against within a month. Not built to last even with light use. It has a built in wash filter to capture lint and the rotations churn the water like a mini-hurricane. It has a fifteen minute wash timer knob, a drain knob, and a spin knob. There are only two drawbacks which I provided feedback on for the seller. You must be very careful not to get water on the control panel next to the fill ports as the knobs are NOT water-tight. They will short out if they become wet. Additionally, do not get the exterior screws wet as they will immediately corrode. I recommended zinc-coated screws or galvanized screws as an improvement suggestion to prevent corrosion. The seller was very quick to respond to our difficulties and sent out replacement parts immediately for the first washer. The repair was very simple once we were able to get the inspection cover open. If anything comes up you will need: wire snips, wire crimp connectors, screw on wire caps, wire peeling and cutting tool, and Phillips screw driver. The first repair (month 1) took less than ten minutes once the parts arrived and I am not a skilled technician of any kind. No instructions were required for the repair. You just have to observe proper wire placement when removing the timer switch and installing the new one. The replacement parts came with wire butt connectors but no extras so don\u2019t mess up. Small, but very powerful. You will want to put something under and around the base of the unit to prevent it from vibrating across a smooth surface such as rubberized mats or a base of anchored 2x4s to hold it in place. Do not let water get beneath the unit as the bottom has many openings to the mechanical area. It is highly susceptible to water entry through the control knobs and the vent ports below (ground level area) on the machine. Electrical Components are bolted to bottom of inside of the machine which I found to be very risky considering how open the unit was underneath. This is probably to help keep the motors from overheating but it is flawed engineering. The machine broke again within less than two weeks of the first repair. It began making a buzzing noise when the wash motor was supposed to be turning the agitator and would only activate if the agitator was primed by hand. We ordered wire butt connectors and replaced the capacitor. The seller was quick to respond again (Michael Greene). You need to have some basic mechanical skills to troubleshoot issues that may come up and they WILL come up. They will work with you if you are not able to complete the repair. We were issued a replacement unit free of charge when the unit could not be fixed within the warranty period. The next unit broke down within our months. After that I decided to write a more detailed review. The seller refused to issue a refund or to send out another unit since they already sent another unit. Overall, this is the most problematic washing machine I have ever owned. I would not recommend buying it unless you have significant skills as an electrician and can be bothered with the time required for continual repair demands.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019m pregnant and live in a 3rd floor walk-up apartment. My laundry is in the basement of the building, so this chore has been close to impossible lately. I decided to buy this portable washer for convenience. While the input hose it comes with is too small to attach to the tub/sink and the drain house is gravity controlled (ie: you can\u2019t put the hose up into a tub or sink to drain), there are still some positives. Washing takes about 30 minutes (15 to wash, 15 to rinse), the spin dryer wrings the clothes out in 5 minutes, so they are just damp & I hang dry them on racks. Until we get an attachment for the input hose, we use our 4 gallon mop bucket to fill up the washing side (filled up 3x for the wash, 3x for the rinse). We were also thinking about getting a shelf for the whole unit that\u2019s high enough for the drain hose to work properly. For now, we use it in our bath tub, and I find it more convenient and faster than schlepping up & down 4 flights of stairs. It would have gotten 5/5 stars if the input and drain hoses were more functional.",
