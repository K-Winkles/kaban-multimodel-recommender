                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I'm obsessed! Great little machine for lighter items.",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. A great purchase! We live with a well in an area that loses power a couple times a year and have been without power for as long as a week. No power, no well. As such I am always looking for ways to function when that happens. This is a great little machine for lighter items which honestly is what you need. I can wear jeans several times, undies not so much! I did two loads of washing and rinsing. I found it takes about 2 gallons of water per wash and 2 gallons per rinse. That said you can use the rinse water from one load for your next wash so two loads = six gallons. My first load had 5 light large women's camisoles (jockey elance supersoft; ladies, if you don't own some you should!) and 5 large women's hipster underwear. My second load was 5 extra large sports bras and 3 large hipster underwear. None were extra dirty just regular wear and they came out clean (actually squeaky clean). If I had heavily soiled items I would pre-treat, soak and scrub as necessary. I used about one tablespoon of Tide HE per wash load and about two teaspoons of Downey liquid fabric softener in the rinse to mitigate any suds that may have remained. This unit will not spin your clothes dry and the way it agitates I would not recommend trying. Just wring your clothes out and hang them. I have a drying rack and a clothes line which I use regularly.When starting it up pay attention to the spin. It should be free flowing. I found with the load of sports bras I originally started with six but took one out to improve the agitation. See the posted video for what I think is good agitation. Also make sure you add enough water. I saw a review where someone noted a motor burning smell. I suspect that would happen if there is not enough water to allow the clothes to float freely thus requiring the motor to do extra work. After two loads the motor was warm but I didn't feel it was over hot. With that I would do two loads and let it rest. Not a deal breaker you just can't run it all day without letting it cool down. The machine is very quiet.This unit will run on our battery pack or with our inverter so it's great for power outages. Laundry may be a luxury during those times but it's nice to have the option to make life seem more normal.I love that I can reuse the gray water. With no electricity, flushing the toilet is a manual process; a perfect use for the water. Also, I could use it to wash the floor. I used the drain hose but you have to attach it after pulling the plug so be quick! Basically you pull the plug and the water comes out there is no way that I can see to attach the hose before pulling the plug. That said it can be done if you are quick just be prepared to position the unit properly over your sink or a large bucket if reusing the water. The hose is very easy to attach.I found it a bit hard to \"pop up\" when I first received it because they instruct you not to press in the middle. I'm a senior citizen so my strength isn't what it used to be but I got it eventually so if this is an issue for you, be prepared to store it expanded just in case. If you are going to collapse it, make sure it is fully dry to avoid mold issues.I purchased a returned unit. I had to give it a light cleaning and there is some sticky residue where it was taped but otherwise fine and worth the savings. Just remember, this is not a regular washer so set your expectations accordingly. With that it can be useful for power outages, camping, washing delicate items, or just saving trips to the laundromat. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a refurbished one, so I am fine with it being used, but I am not fine with getting a dangerous appliance that could cause a fire. As soon as I opened it, I tested it with water only. Worked great for 5 minutes- nice strong motor- but then the turning action got progressively sluggish and weak. Next thing I know, it tripped the GFCI switch on the outlet. I used it on a non-GFCI outlet, thinking maybe the GFCI was being overly sensitive, and it damaged the outlet. Unless you want a fire risk, stay far away from this brand and product. The Moyu brand is much better- I have their mini washer (for socks) and I love it.",

                "reviewText": "I unboxed the machine and found scuff marks at the base of the item. The user manual says the machine is tested before it is shipped so maybe they need to be more careful during the testing phase because I first thought that they sent me a used product. Anyway, I unfolded the bucket and set it on the kitchen counter. I read through the user manual and then proceeded with washing operation. The machine did a good job washing my clothes. The unit did shake a bit but that was due to the powerful agitation in the water. No signs of leaking and the drainage did not take long. I drained directly into sink. The hose provided is useless. One caveat; the washing machine overheats after two washing cycles. I felt the base of the unit and it was hot. I had done 1 wash and 1 rinse cycle for a total of 30 minutes of use. I was afraid to continue with another wash/rinse cycle. Also, the machine has a strong \"new appliance smell\" that I hope will dissipate after it airs out some. Will update this review, if any issues crop up, after I have used the machine a few more times.",
