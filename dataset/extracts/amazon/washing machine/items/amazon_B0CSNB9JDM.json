Can use this product by filling manually with a bucket? Our washing machine can be manually filled with water, and only after the water reaches a certain water level can the machine operate normally. How many water level options does this washer have? With 3 water level: L/16L M/23L H/30L. You could adjust the different washing mode through the wash push-button and control the water level via the switch. Will tihs washer work by putting water in manually, or does it have to be hooked up to a spigot? Dear Customer,thanks for your questions. Yes, this portable washer not only allows you to put water in manually, but also can be hooked up to a spigot. Hoping it will help you. Why did Washer add water, but it can't work? It may be 1. If the water is added manually, it may not reach the water level, so it cannot be started normally; 2. If immersion washing is selected, it needs to wait for a while to start normally.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who has recently downsized to a smaller living space, the KRIB BLING Full-Automatic Washing Machine has been a lifesaver for me. I was hesitant to switch to a compact machine, but this one has exceeded my expectations.I love the convenience of having 10 different wash programs to choose from, each tailored to different fabrics and levels of dirtiness. As someone who is always on the go, being able to throw my clothes in and press a button is a huge time saver.The LED display is easy to read and adds a sleek touch to the machine. I appreciate being able to see the selected wash program and water level at a glance, even if I'm in a dimly lit room.The 8 water level options are also a great feature, especially for someone like me who wants to conserve water and energy. I love being able to choose the perfect water level for my load, without wasting resources.The machine's compact size has been perfect for my needs. I can easily move it from room to room or take it with me on the go. It's also surprisingly quiet, which is a huge plus for me as I often work from home.One thing to keep in mind is that the machine is best suited for smaller loads. I typically do laundry for one or two people, so the 17.7 lb capacity is more than enough. However, if you have a larger family or frequently wash bulky items, you may want to consider a larger machine.Overall, I highly recommend the KRIB BLING Full-Automatic Washing Machine for anyone who needs a compact, portable machine that doesn't sacrifice power or convenience. It has made my life so much easier and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",
