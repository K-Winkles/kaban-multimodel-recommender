It does work fine and there are a lot of complaints about the performance with the basket staying secure it's a 50-50 thing that doesn't bother me. It beats handwashing and keeping some of my delicates and socks, out of my portable washer, I end up, losing my socks in my portable washer even using a zippered bag. Sometimes the bags come unzipped then that's when they get eaten by the washer Im also sick of my delicates getting tangled up in the portable washer I can wash a few slips at a time instead of running the bigger, portable washer this works fine I just prefer another color I ordered the pink. I got it cheap out of the warehouse was refunded and ordered the pink make sure when you buy small ones like this, that they're able to drain on their own and not by hand because if they can't drain on their own that means if you can get the basket to stay on and spin, the water has no place to go.",

To drain you have to unplug really fast to put the hose it comes with and put clean water then put to spin again then out that water to add fabric softener. It makes a bit of noise.
