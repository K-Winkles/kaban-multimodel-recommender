Large enough to wash any type of clothing. The only thing that would make this machine perfect to me is if I didn't have to constantly empty the hose to grown level. And I wish it had a slightly larger capacity for duvets. Other than that.. This totally exceeded my expectations and washes, soaks,rinses and spins. I didn't really trust the hose that came with the machine because it seemed like a pretty flimsy plastic that would become damaged with use overtime. I replaced it with a stronger plastic/ rubbery hose with a saddle included. And I used two clamps at the bottom (beginning)of the drain hose. The clothes are a bit damp after taking them out from spinning if they're bulky. But it doesn't take clothes too long to air dry. I just downsized to a 1 story coming from a 2 story house. I needed a washer and this doesn't take up much space at all. I wanted a huge bang for.mu buck. Right under 200$ and it has a nice capacity!?! Great quality!!!! What a deal!!! And that's just what I got! Great customer service! I'm a happy camper \ud83e\udd70",

I hope it lasts me for a long time.Thank you!",

This machine has a pump that drains the water right out of the machine. Just make sure the hose is secure somehow in your sink when draining so the hose doesn't fly around due to the pressure of the water drainage flow when draining. In this video is my cleaning rags washing away.",

                "reviewText": "When purchasing this machine, there is a good chance that the instruction manual will be with the machine, it took much effort to hook the machine up, the inlet hose it came with fit absolutely nothing so after many tries of running to different stores, in order to work with the water inlet hose. I ended up having to buy a regular washer hose and two types of attachment, one for the faucet that eventually didn't work as planned then I went and attached it to the shower head and Viola' success. The machine has been thoroughly tested and my final take away.1. The washer needs a regular washer hose inlet and possibly two adapters, shop online for a long washer inlet for good reach.2. Washer works well but it is not the greatest in removing water completely on spin cycle, your clothes will retain a fair amount of water.3. washing machine does a decent job of washing, the display is fairly decent to work with considering we didn't get directions.4. The delivery was good, no external damage from what I can see.Is it worth the money, for the effort. In my case yes once I was able to take the time to talk to the right people at the home improvement store, the machine works well despite having any a few obstacles in my way.",
