                "reviewText": "I have been using this machine daily for a week, and for now, I'm giving it a 4.5 star. It's suitable for small spaces, has the strength to wash clothes clean, and is easy to use without the useless instruction that comes with the product.And here are some tips and details for you if you're having troubles like I did or considering a purchase of this washing machine: 1. You can use a bucket to get the water in. But if you want to use the tube, which comes in the box, to connect to your faucet, you must have a fitted faucet or a suitable faucet adapter. I found this Danco Dishwasher Faucet Adapter (The left one in my third picture) to be a perfect fit; it's also on amazon. When you join the tube, push it all the way in (see picture four), so it won't leak or come off. Remember to hold the part that connects to the water inlet side; the tube may come off due to water pressure. 2. The water level label is on the back side of the machine (See the up-left corner of my second picture, the one that shows the inside part). It labels Low, Medium, and High levels. It would be best to keep the water level below the H mark so the water won't come out from the right-side drain tube. 3. For the drainage part, first, ensure this machine is higher than your drain outlet. Then all you need to do is unhook the right-side drain tube and quickly put it down towards your drain outlet. I use my toilet for this, and it works fantastic. 4. As other reviews said, the spin function has a lot of issues. It is noisy and shakes like crazy, but the worst part is that it will melt the bottom of the spin basket, and you need to be very careful if you want to use this function. My suggestions are, first, no more than 3 minutes at a time; Second, while holding the machine when it spins, put down the drain tube to let the water out, and stop the machine as soon as the water flow is small. I'm not having any melting problems for now, but I can't guarantee that it won't melt even if you do as I do. After a quick spin, the cloth will still be pretty wet, but it won't be dripping.Overall, this mini washing machine is one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon. I feel so good now that I don't have to share that one machine with all the other people living in my apartment. And my clothes are as clean as they come from a giant washing machine.",

                "reviewText": "I'm on a fixed income and live in an apartment where we have shared coin laundry and I don't always have the money to use the washer/dryer as the price per load keeps going up so I purchased this in hopes that I could save some money. I am not disappointed with this. I had to watch a YouTube video to see how to use it as it doesn't come with directions (mine didn't at least)... It's a simple process. I do wish the spin part was a little better as I have to wrong some things out by hand but still a good investment overall... When it spins I do have to place a hand on top n apply pressure because it does shake a lot lol but I am pleased with this item. It is a little bit bigger than I thought it would be but it's not bad. I throw my clothes in every other day and hang to dry in the shower on a laundry rack. I do wish the hoses were a bit longer otherwise I'm happy with it. Works well for me and has saved me money as well. Attached a picture for size reference",

                "reviewText": "I will start by saying I have had one of the larger double barrel units before and it worked great. Good sized washer and the spinner made the items very close to almost dry. But I needed a smaller one because I have a tiny apartment. When I got this I was excited. It is the cutest thing ever. The washer was decent sized, I was able to wash about 3 shirts at a time. But that is where the fun ends. I expected the spinner to be small so that was not my disappointment. The spinner could only hold one thing at a time and did not spin out any water at all. The thing that was mostly annoying is the whole thing jumped around while spinning. Pretty much walked across the tub on its own. I had read another review where he said this too but thought I would try it any way. But he was right, you would have to stand there and hold the thing down to stop it from jumping around. Complete waste of electricity. Don't waste your time on this. Also when I tried to use it up on a table first I lifted it up and it had leaked all over. There was water all over the table and floor around the washer. Even if you are in a small space get the bigger one. At least the spinner will do what we expect. I'm disappointed but grateful for easy returns. I may have to pay a little more for a bigger one and it may take up more space but it is worth it. The thing I like about these is how clean and fresh it gets my things. I can visually see the dirt come out of things that had been washed in regular washer. Kinda bad how commercial washers don't get things as clean as you might expect. So, not recommended. But the stronger double barrel washer spinner and you will see the difference in how they spin the items nearly dry. This one, not dry. Still very wet.",
