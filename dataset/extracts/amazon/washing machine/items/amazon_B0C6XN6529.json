After the production of the factory, there will be a washing machine drainage test, which may be the water left in the pipe. It is not a quality problem and can be used normally. Do i need to leave my tap running the entire time it is going through a cycle? Or long enough for it to fill. You should leave the tap running/open because the washing machine has a valve in it that automatically turns the water on and off as needed. Does this compact Washer need to be level with the faucet or can i keep it on the floor? It can be at floor level. All connecting tubes and hoses allow for that scenario. Does this mini washing machine come with wheels? No doesn't come with wheels but you can buy a platform on Amazon to sit it on with wheels Does this portable washer hook up to my kitchen sink? Yes, of course, as long as the washing machine is placed not far away and the hose is long enough to connect to the kitchen sink.",

                "reviewText": "Got this yesterday! Washed 3 loads so far and I am impressed!!! I needed something to use while staying at a resort in Florida as the cost of doing laundry here is like 2$ each wash and 2$ to dry....I have already spent what it cost me to purchase this, that's why I decided to try this. For sure you should not ever overload it. I put in 2 jogger pants, 2 sweaters, 2 panties and 1 pair of socks and there was still room for more. Easy to set up, did it myself within about 30 minutes. Easy to understand and use. I highly recommend!!!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First two uses the inner piece to collect dog hair and whatever else broke and no longer attaches inside machine.After 5 uses I found two screws that fell into the drum during one cycle wash.Now it is leaking from the bottom and I found 2 bolts with washers attached to them that fell off under the machine.I have no idea where they go and no idea why it is leaking underneath it.It is leaking where the main connection is under the washer leading to the rest of the drainage route.But the connection is still secure so no idea why it\u2019s leaking above the connection piece.I don\u2019t wash big loads.Mostly small loads in this needing 3L of water or 6L.My last load I did was 2 new thinner bath towels, 4 kitchen wash clothes and 9 - 11x11 inch rags.Nothing heavy and this was when the washer lost the bolts underneath and started leaking.I bought this because I couldn\u2019t find a used washer I could afford around me.I got it on a sale so paid around $215 for the machine.I haven\u2019t had it long and I don\u2019t use it every day. I planned to use this when I move because even though it washes much Much Smaller loads than a normal washer it has nice selection options for cycles.Cleans clothes very well and due to my health issues I at least still had a way to wash clothes in my home.I\u2019ll be trying to contact customer service with this company to see what options I have.So I\u2019ll edit my review once I get answer from them if I can get ahold of them.This machine is sadly cheaply made and is not worth the listing pricesStuff is glued underneathWires used for the machine are inside a plastic bag and that is wrapped to keep the plastic on.Cheap plastic material used for the drain sections for the water",

I will NEVER want to use any other mini washer ever again. It's so convenient...small enough to fit into my dining area with my mini dryer. I live in an apt complex, so I use them when its raining, when the laudry rooms are closed, and when i dont have money on my laundry card.",
