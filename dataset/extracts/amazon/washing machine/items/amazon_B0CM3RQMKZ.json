                "reviewText": "Living with a grown, nonspeaking son with very severe autism has its high and low moments. One of the lows is bathroom accidents. Cleaning soiled undies is a horrible, horrible task. Being able to send them through this little automatic washing machine a few times before putting them in the family washer is a game-changer. We keep this little machine in the laundry tub. It works, although I don't think there are different \"cycles.\" The \"control\" panel is just a rigid sticker that covers a spring-loaded switch (it came off because of moisture). But since we don't use the \"spin\" cycle, it's fine. An on/off switch is all we need.All in all, this is a lifesaver for families whose special-needs loved ones have this problem.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First impression out of the box, it was very lightweight and compact. So it can be stored even in a small bathroom; just put it under the vanity cabinet. Takes seconds to transform it into a portable 'washing machine.'It has a small capacity, great for underwear, bras, socks, and kitchen towels. From my short experience, I noticed that the smaller the load, the better the washing process. I tested it with my bras and my kids' socks, and I\u2019m very happy. It did a great job; in both cases, everything came out clean. This small washing machine is very effective. You can put the load through a 5 or 10 min cycle. I repeat the cycle twice or more (just to rinse it well) if I put too much detergent the first time and there\u2019s a lot of foam. Then I drain the water. This saves my hands from hand washing, and the clothes come out cleaner.When it comes to dehydrating the clothes, it is very gentle, which makes it perfect for bras. After you lift the outer ring of the dry basket up, just attach it in and make sure the adhesives (they're like suction cups) at the bottom of the machine stick before starting the spin cycle, so the machine doesn't move. I have to mention, the socks didn\u2019t fly out at all, but they weren\u2019t as well drained.Of course, I would have loved to have the chance to have a more potent spin, especially for the socks or towels. However, for that, you would need a stainless steel drum and a more powerful motor. Let's be realistic; this machine is simple and on a budget; therefore, I\u2019m satisfied with the value I got.I would consider its noise low and not bothering. Something I don\u2019t like is the cord (needs to be longer or you need extenction) and the power button. You push it for 2 seconds, and it starts right away at the preinstalled cycle. It doesn\u2019t let you more than a sec to switch to the other cycle, so just push it as much as you need. Also, the touch screen isn't very responsive and doesn\u2019t look of good quality. Hopefully, this will work without problems.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This Portable Washing Machine is a handy addition to any home. With its 11L upgraded large capacity and high power, it can handle deep cleaning for your underwear and other small clothes. The hanging drain pipes make it more convenient to use. While it can effectively clean several towels, the spin-dry function might not be as powerful as expected. Additionally, there's a learning curve with the water drainage system, so be sure to place the drain pipe securely. It's worth noting that the machine can be a bit noisy during operation. Overall, it's a great solution for small loads of laundry, but it might be on the pricier side if not purchased at a discount.",
