                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Let's start by saying this isn't advertised as a $500.00 washing machine. It is in the $20 range and for me, worth it. They describe it as a \"dishwasher and washing machine.\" I've used several items like this or very similar. This one seems fairly sturdy and functions as described (I've used this one once so far.) I've used these types of washing items for washing small, lightweight clothing as well as similar item to wash dishes. For small lightweight clothing it functions the way a standard washing machine does as it agitates the clothing and water. The difference is that you have to do the rest such as rinsing and wringing out.This item has several modes. Automatic (goes through all cycles), agitate only, (rotates), ultrasonic vibration only (used in some dishwashing items) and bubbles only.For small lightweight clothing, the agitating works great. When I use as a dishwasher, I sometimes use automatic (but since it doesn't have a fan guard, sometimes the dishes bump into the rotation.) I also use the ultrasonic vibration alone for dish washing with soapy water. While this doesn't clean like a standard dishwashing unit costing hundreds of dollars, I think of it like I'm soaking the dishes in a \"super soaking\" mode. This allows me time to do other things in the kitchen while the dishes are getting fairly clean. I've also noticed similar items that are advertised as \"portable sink dishwashers\" that only have the ultrasonic vibration feature and sells for more than double. So for me, this is fairly priced and seems to do a decent job.",

                "reviewText": "So I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that this just doesn't work. The water doesn't agitate enough to clean anything.Aside from that obvious info, I'm pretty sure my unit is defective. It doesn't start unless you give it a push start. Also, I can't change the mode unless it has been push started. Also, it only stays on for 10 seconds then just stops and the light blinks and I have to push start the unit in the opposite direction to get it to go again.Also, modes A (automatic) and B (turbine) do the exact same thing, which is to move the water a little bit for 10 seconds and make a current that sucks everything to it and slows down the spinning. Mode C is a very weak vibration that hardly even ripples the water a little bit; it's like a weak cell phone vibration. Mode D says \"bubbles\", and it actually does that... slowly makes tiny bubbles if you have soap in the mix.ALSO, it came with a little card inside that said they'd give me 10 Amazon dollars if I left a 5 star review. I knew as soon as I saw that card that this product would not work well, and I was very right.It's just completely ineffective and a waste of time and money.",

                "reviewText": "I got this little machine to help clean my white socks. Regardless of how clean my laminate floors are, my white socks always end up super dirty. I found a great way to whiten them (called the \u201cmiracle whitening solution\u201d; Google it to get ingredients). I normally soak my socks in the sink with the soap mixture, but I use super hot water and don\u2019t like submersing my hands. So, I filled up a bucket with water, the whitening solution and this thing. It swirls my socks around - which is exactly what I wanted. After it\u2019s done, I wash my socks with the rest of my white clothes that don\u2019t need the miracle solution. So, it\u2019s good enough for my needs.You\u2019ll definitely need to be realistic about what it can handle. Small items (socks, underwear, masks, light blouses, etc). It\u2019s not going to wash jeans or sweaters.All in all, does what I wanted it to do. I\u2019ll probably also use it when I have a load of cleaning rags that need to be washed, but I don\u2019t want to run a whole cycle in the washing machine.",

I have been testing this device out with the energy of a small child wanting to break open a cookie jar. I have used it with hats, delicates, hand towls, socks and anything else I could find. I've used this in small buckets and big buckets. I've used it on the side of the bucket and on the bottom of the bucket. It works extremely well and does way better than my hand washing ever did. I will say that if you use it in a bucket, get a square bucket so it sticks better. It is loud on a tile floor or in the tub but I found putting a towel or mat under the bucket helps muffle the sound a lot!",

It sucks the items to the machine which made it really hard because I had to spread my fingers and put my hand in front of it to stop the clothes or dishes from sucking to it. Which left me with one hand. Because let's me honest, this isn't cleaning anything. I don't like to write bad reviews and try to avoid it to be honest. It's just sad to see the Price and Promise for something not match the Product. So I don't feel bad, because I know I would try the product before selling it and they have to know it works this way. Or \"Don't\" work I should say. It's more compatible for maybe a giant bucket with maybe two small tiny toes in it but be prepared to constantly stop them from sucking into the Product. \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude1e\ud83e\udd10\ud83d\ude2c",
