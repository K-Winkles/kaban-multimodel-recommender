                "reviewText": "Had one of these back in the 50's for baby clothes but you had to wring out the closes, empty out water by hand and rinse. Those had no spin cycle. Decided to check the newer ones out and found this one. It holds more clothes than I thought it would, was quiet and the spin cycle worked well. I live alone and have a few really small load of things like \"black\" clothes, too few to put in my big super washing machine.I set it up in the bathtub in a bath room that the tub is never used Excuse the appearance of the old tub but original bath was built in 1951. Over the years, I have only used this old cast iron tub for bathing my large hairy dog, thus tub is stained. This tub already had a hose attached to facet and perfect for filling up this washer. Placed washer on two 2 x 4 blocks of wood so that it is elevated off tub floor to prevent water when washer is draining from getting into bottom of tub. Placed a screen in drain to catch lint. Have a GFI outlet in this bathroom and cord was long enough to reach. I am amazed at how many items I can get into washer and it agitates clothes well. It does sometimes tangle clothes but I just stop washer and straighten them out. I sometimes reset washer timer to go another 15 min wash. The spin cycle is great but have to spin in two groups of washed clothes as the spin basket only holds one half of washed clothes. Viverates a little when spin cycle starts so I just hold machine to keep it from moving off the wood 2x4's. It levels out in about 60 seconds and does spin water out until clothes are damp dry. Item did not say the spin would stop when you opened the lid during spin but this one does, re-starts when lid is closed again.I really like this little washer, I could see where it would be great for campers and small apartment with no washer available or if you had to go into a basement washroom. I can no longer climb the steps. Also if my regular washer gives out. It would give me time to shop around.",

                "reviewText": "These tiny washer - spinner machines are common in the Philippines which is where I first saw them. After having to downsize, my condo had a small space in my kitchen near the water faucet and drain. This unit fits perfectly in that space whereas a larger standard washer wouldn't. It's very easy to manually fill with hot or cold water and the built in pump allows it to drain above floor level. The electrical components are very reliable and simple, so no issues with complex logic boards malfunctioning. The spinner side holds about 1/2 the washer side load but each dry cycle is only around 4 minutes, so pretty quick. I don't have room for a standard dryer so I just hang my clothes on a clothes rack in my living room and they are dry the next day.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for some extended travels over a few months where I will be driving from state to state, and will not always have access to a full size unit.What I like is that it works as described, and cleans my clothes. It's light and easy to move. The spin works really well and really gets the clothes almost dry, to the point I was surprised.For me, the downsides are; It requires a lot of user attention to get through a load or several loads. The spinner holds about half of what the washer holds, so after your first wash, you move half to the spinner and let it spin, then find a place to put those clothes while you load and spin the second half. then put them all back in the washer for the rinse, followed by a second series of the same thing...for each small load. That being said, I knew all that when ordering, and so it's more that I am disappointed after experiencing what it's actually like to wash with this, but they were clear about what I was getting. It would have been MUCH better to have the spinner of the same capacity as the washer. And even better if they were both the same thing, but they have those, and I didn't buy one because this was cheaper and more portable.Other notes are that when you start the spin, you have to hold the unit steady while it spins up to full speed. Once it's at full speed it's fine, but getting there involves a lot of vibration and it moves all around. Mine also occasionally makes a grindy/clicky noise for a few seconds during the wash. I hope this is normal operation, and not an indication of something about to break. If it does break, I'll update this. I'm not sure what the supply hose is supposed to fit on. Not any faucet or hose valve I have in my house or have ever seen for sure. Maybe something that is standard in Asia?? But I just fill it with a garden hose and that works fine, and is probably faster too. Finally, it's not exactly a water saving type of washer.BUT, like I mentioned at the start, I got exactly what was promised, and it should work fine for my needs. But it's not something I would buy for long term use.",
