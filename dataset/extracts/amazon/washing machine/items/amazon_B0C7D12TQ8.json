                "reviewText": "Positives:*The stick is very tall. Maybe 4 feet tall at least? So you can easily stand up and use it.*It feels super durable. I don't think any of the parts could break. The metal is very thick. The plastic is very thick too.I haven't used it yet, but I don't think it will need much arm force to use it because it is not heavy.Negatives:I had a difficult time assembling the metal pieces. The edge of the metal is thick and a bit sharp and you have to push very hard down on the metal buttons to get them to slide through the holes. I was so worried I might slice my skin off. The buttons just required too much force to push them down. Maybe I did it wrong, but I don't see myself taking this apart in between laundry washes, which means it will take up a lot of space as the thing is kinda big. It probably took me 30 mins to get all the metal pieces together and I had to push onto the floor really hard with all of my weight like throwing myself onto it to get it to snap together. If it wasn't for this, it would be perfect.But I think the value is good for the money because I almost bought the all-plastic version of this (which I imagine is easy to put together/take apart) however, a lot of reviews for that one had it breaking in half, which would be a waste of money. and this thing, despite it nearly being impossible to put together/take apart, seems it'll last forever, so long as you're ok with having it take up some space--or maybe you are extremely strong with big Shrek type hands and the metal buttons would be easier for you to push through?Update: It works well. It does plunge the water through. I found you CAN twist off the top handle and the bottom plastic pieces EASILY which reduces its height a lot. I take it apart doing this and leave the metal stick assembled. This way it takes up WAY much less space without struggling with putting the metal pieces together.",

                "reviewText": "Loved the quality overall and ease of disassembly and ready storage pouch. However, the cast metal threads on either end of the rod that enters the handle and the cone shaped plunger were not cleared of the sharp casting seams and flashing from the molding process and can destroy the softer plastic threads inside the handle and plunger upon assembly. Inspect them and file the excess sharp thin metal from between the threads before assembly. I didn't see the problem until upon feeling resistance to turning, I unscrewed the handle from the plunger and found that the sharp metal extending into the trough of the metal threads had damaged the plastic ones inside the threaded plunger tube and gouged a considerable amount of the softer material away. This is a deficit in finishing and easily corrected before assembly. The item is much higher quality than I expected in every other respect.",
