My laundry, no matter what I do to try and avoid it, inevitably ends up twisted very tightly up if I leave it to swish around in this washer. You need to either be outside or put the saying in a bathtub. I filled mine with a hose from outside. The hoses provided is kind of a small ridiculous plastic one that doesn't work, at least not for me. But on the upside this thing saves a ton of water and electricity and I am happy with it.",
