                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is so far one of my favorite product I ordered on Amazon. It looked small but this washing machine can hold 10L of water which is almost 2.5 gallons.I didn't have had high hopes from it but to my surprise it really cleaned the clothes very well. It's super easy to use and looks amazing. It's kinda loud than I expected but it gets the job done. My partner liked the purple color of this machine. I can easily fold it after the use and quickly unfold it when i need it. I used it for 8-10 times so far and it worked very well every single time. It came with rinse basket but I didn't find it much useful. Apart from that this a great machine. if you are looking for small washing machine then search no further...This is it!!",
