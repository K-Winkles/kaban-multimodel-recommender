If I had to do it again, I would have gotten the largest size, because the medium holds about 1/2-2/3 of a normal load.You might have to dry a couple of items at a time and it doesn't get them totally dry, but it spins really fast and your clothes come out just a tad damp and you can hang them in the bathroom for 20 minutes and they'll be dry. (the normal dryer cycle is an hour). The spinner doesn't hold much and it's not fully automatic, so there's some work on your part moving things around, BUT this costs a fraction of the price of a legit washer/dryer AND it gets your clothes cleaner!I am just hoping it doesn't break down the day after the warranty expires, like a lot of products on here, but I am already getting my monies worth.It's not quiet, but the sound is actually kind of soothing in a weird way.UPDATE: the hose you need to hook it up costs $30.",

The little dryer part gets my clothes mostly dry and they're completely dry after about an hour or two hanging up. Overall I'm REALLY happy with this purchase. My one and only complaint is that the hose attachment doesn't fit my faucet, so I would have to buy an adapter. I've improvised and have been using a bucket to fill up the washer and I've read this way is actually faster, so it works out.",

While washing or drying, it was extremely loud and would sometimes start rocking. The \u201cdryer\u201d really just spins water out and they have to be air dried the rest of the way. The whole process of doing one tiny load of laundry took about two hours between filling, running the wash, draining, filling, rinsing, then drying. I would try to return it but I\u2019d have to pay shipping and it\u2019s not even worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This product has been the best purchace I have made for a long time. I live on the second floor, in a small apartment. Landlord will not allow us to have washers and dryers even though we have hook up for them. I am on disability due to a back injury from a car accident and carrying clothes, groceries, just about anything up and down these stairs takes me out. Having this may would get me evicted but I'm willing to take that chance to not go to the laundromat anymore. First time I used it I thought it was going to wash to color out of my clothes. They are cleaner than what they get in the front load washers at the laundromat. And Lord don't get me started on the spin dryer! No kidding the clothes come out of that thing with dry spots. I truly think you could dry something completely if you ran it for a few cycles. The only con for me is I wish it was a little quieter. Dont want my noisy neighbor reporting me. Going to try a rubber mat under it to see if that helps. Maybe play loud music while I'm using it.",
