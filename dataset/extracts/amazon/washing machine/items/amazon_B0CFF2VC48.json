You can\u2019t overfill the basin, or water will slosh everywhere. It is quite wobbly, especially during the \u201cdehydration\u201d cycle. The lid kept trying to wiggle off. I had a hard time draining all the water out of the basin. I ended up disconnecting the hose, and just allowing it to drain from the plug. Then I took a small towel and hand dried the entire unit. I\u2019m pretty sure it is holding water somewhere, so open air drying is a must. It\u2019s small enough to fit anywhere, and does a nice job agitating \u201cvery\u201d small clothing. I do not recommend this if you\u2019re trying to do soiled laundry. Delicates or (maybe) baby items only!",

                "reviewText": "the collapsible bucket with handle is really convenient. it has 3, 5, or 10 minutes options. it has a pretty powerful spin and clothes come out clean after rinse. it also comes with a collapsible basket for dry spin. the only thing that bother me is the drain plug is hard to plug back in sometimes. also just a heads up-it did not come with a power cord. luckily I found an old laptop ac adaptor charger that fit. other than that, overall it works better than expected!! I love this little washer",
