                "reviewText": "I appreciate the design and functions of the washer, but the drain problem discouraged us from keeping it. Normally a washer would drain at the end of the wash cycle, instead it is always leaking water so that water can\u2019t build up so a wash can\u2019t even happen. Whatever mechanism let\u2019s the drain open at the end of the cycle is just stuck in the open position. No word from the seller/manufacturer after a few attempts. Unfortunately it\u2019s gonna get shipped back.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the best purchase I\u2019ve made this year! It took all 15 minutes to set up. Once I figured out hire the rat guard fit at the bottom, then I set it on the dolly thing with wheel locks, hooked it up to the faucet and boom I was washing. Water will have water in it when you first get because they test it out and I appreciate it. Do not over load this and I believe it will last you a long while. I\u2019ve got the protection plan too. I did a very small load of towels and selected the lowest water level possible and everything worked so well. Later on I did three loads within an hour and a half. As I was hanging the first load I started another one and the first load was nearly dry. The spin dryer feature is thee best and I\u2019m line drying. I found an old phone cord and string it from wall to wall. Old school style. All of my clothes are dry and I\u2019m folding them. My house smells amazing! It comes with the sink attachment and lucky for me everything fits. Tighten up the sink adapters and do not remove any of the \u201co\u201d rings & you should be good to go. I love it! Thank you",
