                "reviewText": "This and all the similar gadgets have some pretty bad reviews but I was desperate and don't want to spend $400 on a counter top dishwasher right now. So I took a chance, not expecting much and this turned out to be a good decision.I filled the container I have with a bunch of small but very dirty food cups. These things take forever to scrub by hand and still come out feeling not fully clean so I've just been letting all dishes pile up. This is a great time saver. It somehow does work to do the heavy scrubbing for you.You need to rinse them after, obviously the water doesn't get magically clean that they wash in. Some need a light wipe down as well, especially if it's a item that got nestled in another. But this is tons better than the intense scrubbing I would have had to do.My second load was a bunch of plastic containers and lids. It worked well but they tended to nestle together a bit more than the cups. Washing none fitting together items obviously will work better. Like your dinner dishes.I also threw a dirty metal dog bowl in. It got it clean of food but did not remove the calcification from past hardwater use, which I didn't expect it to but seems worth mentioning.Bonus it also deodorizes the plastics even ones I could not get smell out of by soaking and scrubbing before.The only down side I have is the suction cups just aren't strong enough. The vibrations make it slowly move to the top and I need to rush over to push it back down to stop water splashing. I will try to find a solution, maybe a giant clamp.It is also noisy but it's not terrible.I have not used for clothes since I do not need it for that. I was also very liberal with the dish soap and used only hot water. This still did way more than soaking without the washer in it ever has.So recap is if you only need to lightly wash dishes then this may not be for you since you still need to rinse and sometimes lightly wipe the dishes. However if you need to really scrub and deep clean things then this is great and saves time. Does the major work, removes odor and did also get rid of any greasy feeling.Tips. Be liberal with the soap so it really suds up and use hot water. Don't go to big with the container. You may need to find a better way to keep the washer in place on the side.",

                "reviewText": "I will preface this by saying I\u2019m not using for clothes, but for rinsing dishes prior to loading into the dishwasher. I figured I would give it a try. The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the remote that is supposed to be on the cord to select the speed isn\u2019t there. This is just a plug in and go type of device so you cannot change the settings. It\u2019s not quiet, but you can\u2019t really expect it to be that quiet anyways. The dishes came out nicely rinsed but I\u2019m not sure how much that had to do with soaking in soapy water or the actual washer. The \u201cultrasonic\u201d is just the device vibrating. Nothing that will actually loosen dirt. I\u2019m not over-joyed with the purchase, but it\u2019s not worth returning since I may use it when my depression flares to help with the dishes still. At least it swirls the water\u2026",

                "reviewText": "Was disappointed from the moment I tried it. I followed the directions to the letter, even going out and buying the appropriate bucket. I washed a single sock at first. The machine didn't agitate anything but me. I wondered if it was too small of a load, so one by one, I added just small socks, removed them, tried other clothes, nothing... All it did was shake my house and give me a migraine. I ended up hand washing all of my clothes. The second (and last) time, I put a couple boxers and socks in the bucket, filled it up with soapy water and the device, and almost instantly, I heard a mechanical snap and water flew everywhere. The top, rotating part of the device sheared off, FLYING out of the bucket, hitting my bathroom mirror, chipping it! Doubt the seller is going to refund me the $550 I need to replace the mirror, so the best I can do is warn others... DO NOT BUY!!! It may be a bit pricier, but just buy a hand crank washing device, they're about $70 on here, even with inflation. And these jerks have the audacity to require the device back, inconveniencing me and my husband because of their bad product... When they can't and SHOULDN'T try to fix and resell it. Dudes... Just refund me. I'll be calling Amazon for such a request. After they see these pics... Do you think I'm lying?Less than 1 star for both the product and the seller. Be and feel ashamed.",

We were looking at small portable washers for our camper and came across this one, for the price we were very skeptical but figured we could return it if it didn\u2019t work\u2026.. we will not be returning it!!! Only down side I could see is if trying to use it in a tub, plugging it in might be challenging. We washed a dirty and yellowed white fleece hat on the test run and with a little bit of dish detergent it came out super white in just a couple of minutes. Definitely worth the money in my book!",
