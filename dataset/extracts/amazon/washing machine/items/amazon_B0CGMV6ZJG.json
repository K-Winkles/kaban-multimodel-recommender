                "reviewText": "We just had a newborn recently, and she's been going through clothes, bibs, and burp clothes like mad. I wanted something small to do the essentials on a daily basis instead of running our normal washer with very few items inside. On average, I'm able to fit 10 bibs and 2 burp clothes, or 4 onesies with a handful of burp clothes or bibs.I have mine near the kitchen sink, and fill with hot tap water for the wash. I'll load up the items, fill with water to the top of the rubber flexible portion (where the color changes on mine from dark purple to light purple), and add 1 tsp tide soap. Run for the 10 min cycle and drain the dirty water. I then spin dry the clothes in the little basket, and refill with clean cold water for the rinse. Run again for 10 min, drain, and spin dry.The wash cycle is honestly pretty effective with cleaning the clothes. The spin dry is a bit difficult to use as the washer tends to bounce around the counter. I find that I need to hold it down for it to work properly. You might have better luck just hand wringing out the clothes instead.Overall, it works for what I need it to do, which is washing small batches of baby clothes every other day. I see this as a device perfect for kid's and baby's items. Sure beats hand washing!",

                "reviewText": "Great for washing small pieces of clothing. T shirts underwear, leggings, hats, small towels etc. really awesome for my small apartment. I bought this a month ago and I use mine almost daily. Surprisingly, one of my most favorite purchases this year for sure. At the time I purchased this little washer it barely had 3 stars so I was skeptical. I\u2019m really happy I took the chance and got it despite the negative complaints I saw in the reviews. Just don\u2019t over load it with large amounts of clothes and it definitely won\u2019t wash your jeans or anything like that! lol",

Only two period panties or three wash cloths.After that fourth time of using it I could not get it to come back on to rinse the soap out and finally gave up and rinsed the items out by hand.My wonderful other half through away the box it came in so I'm pretty sure it's good for nothing but the trashcan now.I definitely wouldn't recommend this mini portable washing machine. It's a waste of money.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I had just completed a trip to the keys in August and the laundry was a tad expensiv in the campground. I had seen these on tick tock and I looked on Amazon for one. I decided to get this one for camping trips. It's a bit cold right now for camping so I decided to unbox it and check it out. As you can see it's footprint is pretty small folded up. The manufacturer has thought of everything. There is a drain hose and a plastic hanger as well as clothes pins. The instructions are quite clear and it's very straightforward. I can see these being used in a college dorm as well.",
