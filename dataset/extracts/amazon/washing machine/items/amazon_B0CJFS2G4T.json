                "reviewText": "After my first blue & white machine arrived damaged on Tuesday afternoon (probably due to the fault of the hasty deliverer), I returned it the following morning. The seller kept reaching out to me and quickly sent me the white & black one which arrived today (Friday) in perfect condition. I've washed & spun clothes with it multiple times today already. It arrived fast, on time, in great condition, and it works well. Both machines are also aesthetically beautiful in person. Another pro is that the spin cycle is almost silent yet my clothes came out nearly completely dry! I love this machine!",

                "reviewText": "This portable washer is very useful but the drainage pipe is quite short so that is a big problem. Putting it on top of a high rise table leading to the bath tub is the best option. I don\u2019t know if anyone else has this issue but when I spin to dry. I used it once and the sides of the dryer are badly scratched from the intense pressure from spinning. I don\u2019t know if everyone deals with this too but I\u2019m scared it might crack open. I am talking with the seller if it does crack to get a full refund or replacement. Other than that it is quite useful and efficient. Just pretty heavy around 30 LBS for me maybe it is actually 22 LBS but feels like 30 LBS.",
