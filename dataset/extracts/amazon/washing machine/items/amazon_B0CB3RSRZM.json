                "reviewText": "I like that it fits onto my small kitchen counter, i like seeing through the acrylic sides to see the amount of suds that choice of soap amount created. I wash my clothes by color and therefore I have small loads most of the time. This washer has already paid for itself. I can walk away from it while the clothes are washing as it is stable enough on the counter. I wash tops, lingerie, soaks, and towels. Maybe 5 or 6 pieces total. I have not washed jeans in this washer as I no longer own any jeans. When I choose to wash my Carhartt pants, I will probably wash them alone or with some socks. The spinning function is challenging. I usually have my hand holding the machine in one place as the spinning at best has the machine walking across the counter. I sometimes dry one or two items in the gallon size basket. The spinning feature is not the best but I kept this machine as the price was very reasonable and the washing of my clothes just gets better and better. I can see how dirty the clothes wash water is as I drain the water right into a white pan in my kitchen sink. I usually rinse twice and sometimes 3 times. This makes me wonder how well-rinsed my clothes could have been when I used laundromat washing machines which rinse once. The laundromats were lowering the temperature of the water in their machines so eventually I found all my clothes were washed in cold water. I finally said enough of that. I wash my clothes in warm or tepid water and rinse them at the same temperature if I want. I have the choice.The cost and overall function of this machine is well worth it for me as my home is small and I am not a fussy person. I repeat. I do have to hold down the machine typically with the spin function and that is about 5 minutes and I am okay with that.This is the first portable washing machine I have ever used or bought. There are so many different choices. It was the smaller size and the very reasonable price that I based my decision on. There are fancier machines that would not fit on my kitchen counter. Fancier models with twin tubs. Maybe next time. I have already used this machine 15 times at $3.00 a load at the laundromat............it has already saved me $45 at the laundromat and I know my clothes are cleaner.",

                "reviewText": "the machine works well you can load two pairs of pants, a couple of shirts socks and it washes well enough. it's been a month since I purchased and have only used it 4 times, I can write a longer review in 6 months. However, the noticeables are when setting the timer it doesn't allow you to select the time you want and begins the moment you turn the dial to the desired time, no wait time just starts ticking right away. not a big deal. The hose is too short and if you place the machine on the floor you have to lift it to tub level to drain the water, I wish the hose were longer for both hoses!!! does anyone know if I can replace them?? also, the spin cycle is terrible and doesn't spin well at all maybe am using it wrong I dunno it would help if the machine came with an instructional manual no manual why? it would be to know am using the spin cycle correctly and maybe it spins well??? otherwise, its working well and am happy.",

Very little water gets in at a time so I just used a bucket to speed it up. Wringing\u2026OMG!!! This thing will end up walking out the door and everyone will know between the shaking and noise. I\u2019m sure the neighbors can hear it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll try it in the tub or think minimum items will keep it quiet. But anything is better than hand washing and walking to the laundry room to find all machines (3 & 3) are in use or even one is broken because it sure messes up the process. If this keeps washing I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get my moneys worth and just use the apartment building machines for the larger loads and bigger items. Unavoidable. Wish I could go for a larger one but too heavy for a 65 year old to pick up and would be visible, which I don\u2019t want.",

                "reviewText": "This washer is lightweight and compact and was purchased to use in my RV. It will wash your clothes but every step is manual and a the entire process can be time consuming. Once you fill and drain the wash water you add the rinse water and then drain again. The spinner is very small and does not spin a lot of water out of the clothes so you have to wring the clothes and then add to the spin basket. You will need something non slip under the machine so it doesn't move around during the spin process. I put the washer in my shower so I could fill and drain it easily. If you are going to use this for all your laundry, purchase a better machine. This machine serves the purpose of washing clothes but is not great for spinning the clothes very dry and it best for small items like under garments and socks or lightweight items that can hang dry easily. For the price it is an adequate machine. I also purchased the 2 year warranty from Amazon for $3.99.",
