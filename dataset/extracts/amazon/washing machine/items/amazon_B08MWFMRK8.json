                "reviewText": "I purchased this product because my apartment doesn't have in-unit laundry. From the first time I used it, it never started spinning immediately as it was supposed to. Instead, there were a few seconds of it just vibrating and making a ton of noise. Then, it would start spinning and alternate directions every so often to agitate the water (which is what it's supposed to do). HOWEVER, it only functioned properly for about two minutes before the motor would stop spinning the top attachment, and it would go back to making that loud vibrating sound until I would unplug it, then plug it back in, and go through the whole process all over again multiple times. So, really, it was just way more trouble than it was worth. Also, after maybe two months of attempted to make it work, the motor just completely stopped spinning the top attachment altogether. And now it's completely useless. I still love the concept of the tool, so if anyone can recommend something that actually works, let me know!",

It installs just fine, and runs well until you out the clothes in the bucket. The clothing gets caught in the twisting part of them unit. I was only washing some delicates, barely enough to fill a grocery bag. But the spin of the unit pulls the clothing against the unit. Once that happens, it doesn\u2019t spin freely. I\u2019d have to keep a hand in the bucket the entire time for it to work effectively. Ended up returning it.",

If you use it as instructed, only a FEW, SMALL items at a time, it works like a regular washing machine. The first load, I had to remove one item because it was one too many for the current but, once removed, it ran smooth.Uses less water and is better at getting deep stains than hand-washing the items.
