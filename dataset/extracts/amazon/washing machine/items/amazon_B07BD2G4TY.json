                "reviewText": "Absolutely LOVE my washer! Of course I read all the reviews of any product I'm looking to purchase and I found almost all negative reviews of this washer were about the fill and drain process. In my case there was only one way I could use this washer so i knew the issues that others had experienced were not going to be an issue for me. I live in a house built in 1921 that was converted into 2 apartments with mine being on the 2nd floor so its limited on space and no washer dryer hookup. But one of the beauties of my apartment is the cast iron clawfoot tub and huge linen closet in my bathroom. The washer fits beautifully in the bottom half of my linen closet (took out a nonessential shelf) and is so lightweight than I can lift it easily into my tub (I have horrible arthritis in my hands). I also have a handheld shower head which makes it so easy to fill so I dont have to mess with hose connections to faucets and since clawfoot tubs slope the tiniest bit there is no problem with draining. I just plop the showerhead into the washer to fill and unhook the connected drain tube from the side of the washer to drain and it drains completely.About filling and draining...I find that if I fill with water first I can add the amount of clothes accordingly without overfilling. The washer has a water fill line to avoid overfilling which will result in water all over your floor because of the overflow drain if you dont watch. I have walked away while filling and gotten sidetracked and overfilled once ir twice but since my washer sits in the bathtub it just drained into the tub so I didnt have a flood on my floor and also because our water company charges a flat rate whether I use a quart of water or 50 gallons of water I get charged the same so it wasnt catastrophic, but you will need to stand and watch your water fill if you dont want a mess on your hands.Loading process...You can actually fit quite a bit in this beauty. I can load 2 pairs of my son's work Jean's into the washer (he wears 32x36 carpenter jeans, pretty bulky) or a pair of jeans and 3 or 4 work shirts in one load and they come out soooooo clean! It agitates pretty powerfully but not so much that it destroys your clothes and in my opinion cleans better than the full size washers! You can see the dirt and even blue die from 3yr old jeans in the drain water! Of course the soap matters too. I experimented with 3 different laundry detergents and tho I was still getting clean clothes I was rinsing several times just to get the soap out. I finally discovered the type and amount of detergent is extremely important in order to get the maximum clean but also to avoid excessive water usage because of repeated rinsing. I use Tide HE (high efficiency) and it's perfect in cold water! It also saves on money because with this washer you only need a LITTLE. I use only 1 teaspoon per load. (Yes, 1 tsp) I know you think that would NOT be enough to clean anything let alone a load of dirty work jeans but you will be amazed! I know I was! After all the experimenting I found the perfect combo for super clean and only one rinse cycle! Yes I miss the convenience of an automatic washer cycling but when your limited, you adapt. With these types of portable washers you have to fill to wash, then drain, and then refill to rinse and drain again, so to much detergent or the wrong type of detergent will result in several repeated drain and fills along with wasting water and your time.The spin dry process..This the tricky part of the whole process because you have to have the spin basket filled just right or it will be unbalanced and you will have loud thumping and a dancing washing machine. But after a couple of uses you will figure out the secret. You can't fit as much in the spinner as you can in the washer so this takes some time if you wash a full load. Only one pair of my son's jeans can be spun at a time but with only shirts etc I can load most of the load all at once. When first using the spinner you need to be attentive, you can tell immediately if you have overloaded by the sound and can run the risk of breaking the washer. But the spinning process is exceptional! After spinning it takes no time at all to dry in the dryer! It spins out the water so well that 2 pairs of my son's jeans dries in 15 minutes in my portable dryer! I hang dry a lot of my blouses and such and the way the spinner works my things dry in less than 2 hours! Of course that also depends on the weight of the item, my sweaters take longer but not near as long as it took after washing with a full size washer. The difference in spin cycles between the two types is pretty great and because there is no agitator stem in the middle there is nothing for your clothes to get twisted around.Bottom line this is a great machine. I have had it over 2 months and do not regret my purchase at all!. It does take extra time because of the size and the filling and draining process but it sure beats schlepping tons of laundry to a smelly, overcrowded, overpriced laundromat! My trick to time saving is not letting the laundry pile up!",

It does get my clothes pretty clean & dries rather well in the unheated spin dryer.5 stars I rate this item as it works good enough to get the job done quickly.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this machine heavily (multiple loads per day) since the beginning of May, due to some plumbing issues which have FINALLY been repaired. It does a good job getting clothes clean - better than I would have expected - and spins things nearly dry. The side-by-side washer/spinner is HUGELY better than the devices which do both in the same tub (like the one I have in my campervan) because you don\u2019t need to be able to put the wet clothes anywhere waiting forever their turn to be spun. It\u2019s also easier to get the spin basket balanced.But after just under 4 months, it died. From working perfectly to flat out dead. I was expecting such a hassle from the company but I sent them a message, they asked a few questions & two days later a brand new machine arrived. Can\u2019t do better than that.I didn\u2019t really feel like I could give 5 stars to something that died like it did, but I would think this wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a single person with normal washing, or a health care worker using it to separate work clothes from the rest, this would absolutely meet your needs. And now there\u2019s a larger model, which would be even better. These really could reasonably replace a standard washer, if you\u2019re doing regular laundry for 1-2 people.Would highly recommend, despite the machine failure.",
