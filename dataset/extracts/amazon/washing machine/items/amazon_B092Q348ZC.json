                "reviewText": "It's useless for anything other that running soapy water through your wash items. I put some medium soiled rags through the was. None of them came clean at all, not even a little bit. The fact that it doesn't have any kind of spin function or something that would make them not be sopping wet when you pull stuff out makes it that much more of a useless purchase. This washer is the equivalent of throwing your items into a sink with water in it then stirring it mildly with a spoon for 5-15 minutes. Then I had to pull the rags out one by one and wring them out by hand to get the excess water out of them. I'm returning this and saving up for a slightly more expensive one that actually washes and spins my cloth items. I honestly can't see this tub being useful for anything but making your wash smell nicer than before you washed them. I just wanted to have something small I could clean my rags and small clothing items in then hang out to dry. This is not it.",

I was like a little kid in a toy store, excited and couldn't wait to hook it up and start washing clothes, just to be disappointed when it didn't work. Instructions were very vague - did not give a lot of detail for setting up. Item appears to be slightly different from what appears in the photo on Amazon. Both machines I received had no working button. Maybe I'll try again someday and instead of ordering a pink one, I'll have better luck with a blue one.I would have rated higher if the item had worked.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. A little more expensive than I wanted to pay for it in canada but nevertheless I needed a small portable washer for my table wash cloths that I used in the kitchen. Probably will use it for my underwear, socks and any small items. Of course just like a good cook just put in a random amount of hot water, random amount of detergent, hold the button for two seconds and it doesn't start after a minute or so it might be on pause, just tap it again and it should start. It spins in one direction for a seconds, stops and spins in the other direction.. then after a few minutes, it vibrates. Now here is the thing... the ultrasonic and vibration is probably all a trick much like the vibration motor on your phone, but nevertheless it vibrates. I looked it up on the internet about ultrasonic for washing clothes and on the internet it says that it isn't effective as the ultrasonic is absorbed by your fabrics so it doesn't really do anything if real. Plus ultrasonic is a high pitch vibration and now a low thrum which makes me think that this is just a trick. Anyways it does rotate and agitate your wash and the water does turn muddy and murky with dirt so it does what a washer does, perhaps not as clean as if you were to put it in a real washer but nevertheless at minimum it washes like you would if you put your laundry into a tub and hand wash it. Once the full cycle is complete, just dump out the water and surprisingly it isn't that heavy. I do wish there was a sprout on it and dumping the water out using a corner of the device still makes the water run down the side of the device thus I recommend pulling the plug out before pouring the water out. Once the water is poured out, I use one hand to squeeze the washcloths to simulate the spin cycle and then I filled the bucket with hot water again for rinse. I then start the 9 minute cycle again and this time the water is still muddy and murkey showing that my washcloths were really dirty. Poured the rinse water out... rinse each under the tap and hang to dry. Place the tub upside down in the sink too dry... then collapse and find a nice place to store it, most probably under the sink. Not bad for a portable washer. My only concern that it will stop working due to the motor burning out. Will report in a year or so but so far I am happy with it even though I think the ultrasonic is just a gimmick but it works otherwise for small amount of bachelor laundry. Better than spending $20 for the coin operate Laundromat in my apartment. Just saved $20.",
