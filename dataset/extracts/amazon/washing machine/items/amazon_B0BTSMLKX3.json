The machine not only leaves clothes exceptionally clean but also almost dry. Its compact size allows for easy movement by a single person with minimal effort, making it ideal for small spaces. The installation process is simple, and it offers various washing options to cater to different needs. I highly recommend it for those seeking a portable washing machine.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant about getting it, however it has been a great deal for its price. The clothes are almost dry by the end of the cycle and it washes really well. The pump works, I recommend getting a base for it to elevate the machine so the drain is as straight as possible, however, mine is in more angle than the manual says and it still works great.You need to close the water when the cycle starts, manually, but again for the price you get a pretty good machine.",

                "reviewText": "What can I say? I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get this sooner. Almost 3 years of living in an apartment, having to get coins constantly and wasting money on 100 year old dirty machines.This thing has changed my life!!! It has all the functions you would ever need. Even \u201cchildlock\u201d which is coming in handy\u2014my cat kept pushing the buttons and ending the cycle, lol.My tips:-have someone handy in order to do the sink hookup. I purchased a separate sink attachment on amazon so I can switch from sink/laundry easily. My dad also purchased me a new hose and stuff but that\u2019s not totally necessary. When I initially was trying to do the sink hookup on my own (just with the products that came with it), water was spraying out of my faucet. Really recommend having someone handy help the initial setup.-do not use laundry pods. Suds were boiling over every time and items were coming out stiff. I use 1/2 TBSP of HE detergent and it\u2019s been going better.-get a dolly (on amazon) to prop it up and easily move it when not using.-SECURE the drainage hose. I used a hair tie and a butterfly clip.-do an extra spin cycle to dry the clothes even more. You can also do the \u201ctub dry\u201d which is a 30 min spin cylce.I absolutely love being able to do laundry right in the convenience of my own home!",
