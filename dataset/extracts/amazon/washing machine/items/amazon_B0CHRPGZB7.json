I think sometimes better than my big washer did. I would recommend buying this machine, and I hope for many more years out of it. It\u2019s quite and spins the clothes almost dry.",

It\u2019s pretty quiet, unless you do small loads then you can hear a lot of splashing. The video pictured must be the larger one because mine isn\u2019t as big as I expected it to be, but it fits the space I have for it so I\u2019m happy.",

It's not the worst thing ever, but it does make things inconvenient and you end up having to attend to the machine every few minutes so that the leakage doesn't get out of control. The beeping on this machine is also a bit loud, I wished it had a better notification sound that doesn't hurt your ears.",
