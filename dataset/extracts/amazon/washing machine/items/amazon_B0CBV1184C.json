I have in my pop-up tent camper and recently used it on a trip to Montana.This washing machine is small and light, so it's easy to carry. It doesn't take up much space, so it won't make your room messy. It really is helpful to have when you have space that is limited.Even though it's small, this washing machine is powerful! It can clean all kinds of clothes, socks, and underwear. I used it after going on day-long hikes around the Grand Teton as well. It's really good at getting things clean.What's neat is that I used this washing machine for more than just clothes. I can wash towels and even shoes! It's made with strong materials, so it will last a long time. I'm still using it now without a problem.Using this washing machine saves me time and is super easy. I don't have to wait at the laundromat or wash things by hand. You can do your laundry at home or anywhere you want. I already had 2 friends who purchased their own.My wife and I really enjoy the convenience of this washer machine, I save on detergent as well. It really get me out of a bind when I need something cleaned immediately.My portable washer machine is a fantastic solution for my laundry needs. It's small, powerful, and convenient to use. We wash our underwear, baby clothes, and more with ease. Plus, it has saved us money on water and electricity.",

                "reviewText": "I want to preface this review by saying I bought this portable washer primarily to dye clothes and small amounts of fabric. Most dyes require the clothes to be constantly stirred or agitated to ensure the dye evenly saturates the clothes. I don't have the time to stand at a bucket for 30-60 minutes to agitate the clothes by hand; I much prefer to take 30 seconds every 5-10 minutes to come back and restart the machine.And I'm really pleased with the unit. It works as it says it does if you're working with small batches. There are fewer pros than cons, but the most important elements I required ended up in the pros list. The problems with the unit are minor issues. There are also some things that are neither good nor bad, but you might want to keep in mind.Pros:-Set up is easy. Everything fits together well, it unfolds easily, it's easy to fill up with a bathtub faucet or extendable showerhead. For reference: My mother is in her mid-60s and would have no problem unfolding this and using it, my boyfriend's mother who is almost 80 might struggle a little with it.-Good agitation. I was concerned this would only spin in one direction, but thankfully it rotates back and forth. It spins clockwise for about 30 seconds, stops for a moment, then spins counter-clockwise for 30 seconds, and repeats this for the duration of the cycle. (For my purposes, I still need to stop it and adjust the clothes as they can't spread out quite as much as I'd prefer in the small unit, but if you're just washing clothes that won't be an issue.)-Suction cups on the bottom for extra stability. This is especially good if you're using it on a countertop where it could be more easily knocked over.Cons:-The instructions aren't clear. There's no maximum fill line, no specified water temperature. There's no explanation as to what the different settings are best used for (ex: heavy soil vs light, wash vs rinse). It's not explained that you have to start the cycle first, then push the button to select your wash time.-It rocks back and forth A LOT. The suctions cups give it enough stability that I wasn't concerned about it falling over, but it does cause the water to slosh around and splash out the ventilation holes in the top of the unit (the holes are not completely covered by the lid). Since I plan to use it to dye clothes, I obviously don't want dye-water splashing out and staining my tub. Putting a paper towel loosely over the holes solved that issue.-The plug is short, only about 3 feet. I imagine a lot of people might want to use this in their bathtub, for the ease of filling it up and draining it after. For safety reasons, most bathrooms don't have outlets within 3 feet of the bathtub. You'll either need to use this on a countertop, or get an extension cord.-It's noisy. This is the only con that really bothers me. I can hear this thing running in a different room with the door shut. I tested this with a single tank top (women's 2XL) and after 7 minutes the motor sounded like it was struggling. I would not use this for doing a lot of loads right after the other.Things that aren't good, aren't bad, but worth keeping in mind:-It's small. The amount of clothing the photo says it can handle (3 t-shirts, 6 towels, etc) are probably based on a person who is a bit slighter of stature and build. Take a look at the size of the thing when you get it, compare the size of your clothes, and be realistic about what you're going to be able to fit. [For the record, the towels they mention in the photo are most likely small face towels; you are not putting a standard bath towel in this thing.]-The drainage hose is basically useless. You need to unplug the drain nozzle to get it on (there is no plug on the hose, so you can't attach the hose and then plug it), which causes water to spill while you're trying to put the hose on... it's just a mess. It's easier to just set the unit in the bathtub or sink next to the drain and let it drain without the hose.Like I said, the cons list may be longer than the pros list, but they're minor issues compared to the benefits. The unit works. I'm confident it will get your clothes clean as long as you're realistic about the amount of clothing it's made for. This isn't going to replace your trip to the laundry facility, but it will get you through if you realize you don't have any clean underwear or you spill something on your shirt that you want to wash off before it stains.",

The dryer function spins and remove all excess water and I can hang it up to dry.

                "reviewText": "The picture above shows falsified information. As you cannot wash three T-shirts, you have to wash one at a time . You cannot wash six towels. I bought the washer just to see how good it works. It\u2019s OK but it\u2019s not worth your money. If you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s actually going to wash T-shirts and maybe one or two towels don\u2019t buy this item. Go for a bigger item. Little bit more money but trust me it will probably work a lot better than this piece of crap.",
