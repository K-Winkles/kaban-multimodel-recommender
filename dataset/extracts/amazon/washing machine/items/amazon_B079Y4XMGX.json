I am questioning the longevity of the brand and concerns with my purchase.Original post-We have had this combo unit about a month now. So far they have been perfect. The washer works great and the dryer dries surprisingly fast. We full time in a camper so this has made our travels and comfort so much better! No more trips to the laundry mat! My only complaint, which might be user error... is that the dryer does not turn off on its own. I have read through the manual and cannot find anything addressing this issue. What I mean by not turning off, is that the dryer will stop and start automatically until you manually press the off button. So it will dry through its cycle (which auto detects the amount of moisture) and once it reaches the acceptable limit it will turn off but turn back on \"refreshing\" so to say about every 5-10min until you turn it off. Like I said, maybe it's user error.. But this is my only complaint. Outside of that, it's been perfect.",

The spin is high speed (important for the drying process) and very well balanced. The functions of both machines are clear and well displayed and overall they are also remarkably quiet. I am very pleased overall and fully expect them to operate without issue if well maintained. I might even go so far as to say I would be confident installing these in a coin laundry environment :)",

                "reviewText": "6/20/22 Update:We've had this set for a few months now so here's an update. The washer works great on the standard cycle. It cleans good and spins the water out well, even sheets. There were a couple weeks the lights would go off on the display during the cycle, probably something knocked loose due to the shaking, but the cycle would still complete and it's back to normal for now. The detergent drawer knocks loudly during the spin cycle so I use painters tape to help keep it closed. Regarding the dryer, after it completes its cycle occasionally it will do a tumble, I'm assuming to keep your clothes moving to prevent wrinkles. It will do that until you turn it off. The only thing I don't like about the dryer is the filter.Purchased to use in our 5th wheel. We knew going in they will be small and we don't mind that part. It's just the 2 of us and I do a load a day. The washer doesn't spin all of the water out when you do sheets. We can't wash blankets in here, not even the small couch throw blankets with the fringe on the ends or mattress protectors. It will not drain the water out. I really wish it had a spin-only cycle option. It has a drain only option but it doesn't get the water out. There is also no option to use bleach in this washer. I like the dryer a lot except for the filter. It is complicated to clean. You have to reach in the back and pull it off the wall. It comes apart in 3 pieces (see pic). You have to wipe the lint off the mesh and use a lint roller on the white felt. Then you have to put it back in the dryer which can be difficult sometimes because you have to line it up just right. Recommend you look for a washer with spin-only option and dryer with easier to clean filter.",

So far they've been able to Handel my day to day use.I however, dont like how cheap the knob is on the washer that the dryer is so low to the ground is you dont stack the. Also the dryer doesnt have a screen....youd think for the price your at least have a digital screen. But none of that really matters as long as they work well.Its definitely a good buy.",

Even a small load of lightweight clothes were damp after a full cycle.. The drier works OK if I use the 60 minute timed dry but the lint filter is horrible to reach ..I wish I could return them but Amazon says I can't..",
