                "reviewText": "This portable washing machine is pretty small, but it\u2019s perfect for its intended use. I do a lot of DIY projects and oftentimes I use old fabrics to make pillow cases/covers (vintage throw pillows). I don\u2019t like to sew with used fabrics that haven\u2019t been washed. I used to just throw them in with a load of laundry, but I wanted something I could keep in my workshop. That\u2019s where this small but mighty portable washing machine comes in. It\u2019s perfect! I set it up beside my portable dryer and it barely takes up any space. It could also be used to wash any small items, and it would work great for delicates, like bras and underwear, although I haven\u2019t tried it for that purpose yet. I also thought about how fun this set up would be for a child to use (with parental supervision/assistance) for doll clothes. It would be a fun activity that also teaches the responsibilities of clothes washing. You could set up a little clothes line to hang the doll clothes to dry. I just think it would be adorable! It would also work well for pet clothes if you have the need. Overall I\u2019m impressed with this little washing machine. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Since no instructions were included with the product, I had 0 idea how to use this. But I contacted the company and they sent me most of the instructions. Still, you have to figure a few things out, like that you have to empty the water each time. So you fill the water and detergent and wash. Then you dump out the water and put in fresh water to clean. Then dump that out. Then finally add the spin basket to spin. If you don't have a washer handy, like on a trip, this is a really nice portable option for small items like socks. If you had this and an 11L one then both would do a great job on most items. Here's the instructions they sent me if this helps you.How to use our Portable Washing Machine? Our washing machine has 3 modes of use, standard wash, soft wash and drain. The standard wash will work for thicker or dirty clothes that need longer washing time. The gentle wash will work for smaller clothing such as socks and underwear or for smaller loads of clothing less than or equal to 2 pounds. Finally, the drain mode will be useful to remove excess water from your clothes. 1. To start using your Portable Washing Machine, press and hold the \"Switch\" button for 2 seconds to start the machine. A beep will sound at the same time. 2. Click once to switch the sync mode between the 3 modes. 3. The bell will ring once and the machine will start working. The disinfection lamp will always be on. 4. When your portable washing machine finishes washing or draining, the machine turns off and will beep 3 times and the disinfection lamp turns off. NOTE: If you are using the standard wash or the soft wash, you must remove the included drain basket. This is only used for drain mode. Your Portable Washing Machine is equipped with a locked rotor detection function. When the motor is stuck, the buzzer will beep an alarm and the disinfection lamp will flash twice and then turn off. 1) How much water do you add? It should be filled with warm or hot water (not boiling) until the clothes are completely submerged. It should not exceed the horizontal line marked on the outside of the portable washing machine. 2) Can I use laundry soap? Of course! You can use laundry soap as well as detergent, fabric softener, and other products. Use the amount of soap and fabric softener in proportion to the amount of clothes you are going to wash. The average measurement is 1/4 oz for .75lb, a full load. 3) Do I have to use the basket or can I wash items in it without the basket? If you are using the standard wash or the soft wash, you must remove the included drain basket. This is only used for drain mode.",

                "reviewText": "I received my first washer weeks ago, and it was broke. It didn't spin, the motor was trying to spin but the plastic part broke after one wash which was a shame because that first wash really worked.I contacted the email that came in the package and they quickly agreed to send me a new washer, after sending them a video of the washer not spinning.My second washer didn't seem to spin as powerfully but at least it spun. This washer is cute, and I love the way it collapses. It's quite tiny and fits perfectly on my countertop.I can wash two articles of clothing at a time, if I add a third the machine struggles to spin.I can tell it actually works though, I washed a new set of pillowcases and a bunch of the dye came out.I think the uses for this are pretty obvious, if you have baby clothes you need to wash you can run them in this machine a few times, if you have clothes that really need a good sanitizing maybe choose a standard washer.I do believe this would be great for dyeing small items or washing things with grease if you don't want to wreck your big washer.For the price I was hoping for something a little more functional, but I'll keep using it. If you're spending a lot of time in a camper or van- living this might be a better option when you're away from laundromats or run out of quarters.I refuse to use the dryer basket. It's IMPOSSIBLE to remove and you feel like you're breaking the machine getting it unlatched.Tldr: it works for a few small articles of laundry.",
