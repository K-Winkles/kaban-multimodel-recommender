                "reviewText": "1st, like most ppl say, the hose & cord is way too short, especially seeing how they're on opposite sides of the machine. It would have been better if the cord & hose was on the same side. 2nd, the instructions are horrible. Running a load is pretty much common sense but as far as just info about the machine, nothing 3rdly & the most frustrating thing is after u drain it, if you move it around you can still hear water laying in the bottom of the machine. That isn't good & it worries me. That will eventually start ro mold & stink. 4th, even if it ISN'T switched to drain, if the hose falls over, it will leak everywhere!I finished a wash, unplugged & went to slide it iver to my tub & the hose fell (bc the little attachment that holds the hose is so cheap & loose) and water went EVERYWHERE... I was so so so excited for this machine & kinda still am but these few issues have kinda dimmed my excitement. Especially the fact it doesn't drain the water completely & leaves water behind. Like what am I suppose to do, lift it & dump it upside down?Anyway, I want a longer stronger hose (bc the one it comes with is EXTREMELY flimsy thin junk) so I contacted the seller in hopes they can let me know what size hose & if I can totally swap it out or if I can only add an extension. Hoping they respond soon",
