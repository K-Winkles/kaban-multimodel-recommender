                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this because a coin op dryer ate my quarters... and I live in an apartment.It cost me $1.00 to wash and $1.50 to dry for one load at my apartment complex. I do 2 loads of laundry every week. So $5 a week. $20 a month. $240 a year... I\u2019d like to say that buying this machine saves me money immediately! And I don\u2019t have to pay for water at my apartment complex.I waited about a month before leaving a review. It took about a week to receive after I placed my order. I also bought a 5 year warranty on it. So do that to save you the hassle if anything does happen to go wrong with the machine which can happen. It\u2019s a machine, not a \u201c it will work till the end of time\u201d miracle machine.Let\u2019s gets one thing straight before I continue... THIS IS NOT A DRYER. This is a wash, drain and put your clothes in the spinner to get excess water out, then either hang dry or use a electric dryer. People complained how their clothes weren\u2019t dry... it\u2019s a PORTABLE WASHING MACHINE not a dryer even though most clothes come out to be barely wet. You will still need to either dry it by using a dryer or hang drying it.I bought a adjustable dolly to move the machine around on and 4 stainless steel hangers with clips both purchased on amazon posted in the photos above, to hang underwear, socks and wash rags.My first load of laundry consisted of two scrub skirts, two scrub shirts, two tank tops, three pairs of shorts, six pairs of socks, and three pairs of underwear. All which fit fine in the machine just fine and I would have been able to add even more clothes into it.I do 2-15 minute wash cycles and 2-15 rinse cycles adding in fabric softener to the rinse and drain it into my toilet. The water just flows down and won\u2019t clog your sinks or drains according to other reviews. I rinse by draining the wash water, adding clean water to it and adding in fabric softener. After it\u2019s done rinsing, I drain it and put a couple items of clothing at a time in the spinner to drain excess water and they are pretty dry. Almost like a regular washer how damp your clothes are. But some clothes dried in like 10 minutes after hanging them. Don\u2019t over load the spinner as it won\u2019t work or drain properly.When you put an item of clothing into the spinner and it starts clunking around, rearrange the clothing just like you would when a normal washing machine that gets off balanced. I also don\u2019t keep the plastic cover it comes in the spinner as it makes too much noise. You could personally do without it. I don\u2019t see the purpose in it.Towels can fit in the machine just fine but if you hang dry them, even with adding fabric softener, your towels will be hard and crunchy. Either deal with it, or put them in a dryer.Yes, sometimes clothes will get tangled up. After the first 15 min cycle of washing, I lift the lid and untangle the articles of clothing if they are tangled and do the last 15 minute. Cycle. Not a big deal as that happens with regular washers as well.You can either wait the full 5 minutes for spinning, or spin for about a minute till majority of the water is out and then either hang dry, or place in a dryer. But even after 1 minute most of the water is out of the clothing and it\u2019s just damp at that point. The directions it came with don\u2019t even make sense. So here\u2019s what you do:1) On the backside of the machine you\u2019ll find the plug in. Plug that into any outlet near the area you will be washing. Yes the cord could be longer. I would recommend a bathroom so you can put the drain hose into the toilet. See above photo2) attach the hose on the top of the machine to the sink you will be using to fill your machine up with. Again I recommend the bathroom sink. Photo above.3) make sure the switch on the top is on normal and not drain. If it\u2019s on drain the water will \u201cdrain\u201d and not fill up your machine. And if it\u2019s on drain and your drain hose isn\u2019t in the tub or another sink, or in the toilet, water will go everywhere. But I haven\u2019t had this happen as I pay attention to what I\u2019m doing.4) take the drain hose on the bottom left of the machine and put it under your toilet seat lid( after you have cleaned your toilet of course) so the water will drain into your toilet when you do drain it. Photo above. You can put it in the tub if you wish, but I couldn\u2019t get the hose to stay put anywhere. Plus is gives my toilet an extra clean.5) fill 1/4-1/2 with clothes and add your soap. Liquid soap is better. Powder if you have to. No pods of any kind. What I like most is I can add as little or as much water as I want.6) fill water to the point all the clothes are covered with water. Don\u2019t use too hot of water tho. Cold and Luke warm will do just fine.7) set time for 15 minutes twice and then drain( make sure drain hose isn\u2019t on the floor and is either in the tub, another sink or the toilet). This is your wash cycle. You will have to go back after 15 minutes to set it for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes washing. You could do a 15 minutes wash only if you wish.8) after you have drained the wash water, fill with clean water and fabric softener if you chose and do another 2-15 minute cycles to rinse. You will have to go back after 15 minutes to set it for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes of rinsing. You could do only a 15 minutes rinse if you wish.9) drain the rinse water ( make sure drain hose isn\u2019t on the floor and is either in the tub, another sink or the toilet) and keep the knob on drain. Remove the plastic top in the spinner side, it really has no purpose. Set the spinner to 5 minutes as thats all that allotted anyway. Add a couple of articles of clothing into the spinner. And close it. When it spins if you hear any knocking give it about 3 secs. If it stops your good. If it don\u2019t, rearrange the clothes and try again until the knocking goes away.10) hang dry or use a electric dryer.Your clothes will be dry by morning if you do laundry in the evening. I hang mine in my bathroom or in my closet where they will be going anyway.I can\u2019t understand why people complained about this machine... they are either abusing it by overloading it, misusing it or user error. A child could do their laundry with this thing.This machine is so convenient as I don\u2019t have to have to get ready and make myself presentable to go do laundry. I could do my laundry in my own apartment in my birthday suit. I love it. It\u2019s small but does a lot of clothes at once. It\u2019s compact and easy to maneuver around my apartment. It\u2019s light weight, and easy to use.I will in the future be purchasing a dryer for my towels. Which is the only downside I have. But I\u2019m not going to leave a bad review for that.Best purchase I have made in a long time.",

                "reviewText": "As shown in the attached photo, it's tall but narrow. It's about 1/2 the width of my trash can. It's not very heavy at all. I store it in the corner of my kitchen, between my deep freeze & trash can. When I need to use it, I slide it across the kitchen very easily. I have extensive damage to my left arm/wrist/hand, but have no difficulty sliding this unit. I did try it in my bathtub when I 1st got it because that's why I didwith a smaller model I had previously. It honestly was too difficult to maneuver over the tub with my limited strength & mobility. But I'm very happy with it in my kitchen. A smaller model I had didn't pump out to drain, it only really used gravity. This model actually pumps out to drain, so I'm able to drain into the sink. The drain hose goes up & over the side of the sink & drains into it very well. That 1 feature made it feasible to use it in my kitchen & not have to struggle to get it into the bathtub. This wash fun is huge! You can see the clothes in front of unit in my photo, that is a load that I normally use. I honestly do a full size regular wash load in it. Except if I'm doing towels or jeans. Then I only do 3 or 4 at a time bc I don't want to break it. I've washed 3 queen sized sheets & 6 pillow cases in it at the same time. I hesitate to make very heavy loads though bc that's how I broke the last one lol the spin dryer side is also very large but about 1/3 the size of the wash tub. It works very well when used correctly - push the lid guard all the way down on to the clothes, but under the clothes. I use a hanging rack & hangers & fan to finish drying. Clothes are usually dry that night. The spinner gets lightweight clothes practically dry if used correctly. It does make noise but not like a big washer. I live in apartments & haven't had any complaints about noise. My box fan is actually louder lolFYI- I do usually put a towel down on the floor behind unit bc I usually have puddles. I'm not certain if that's bc I make such a splash mess or if the unit leaks slightly when draining.The 1 complaint it that I wish the water inlet tube was a little thicker. I was able to stretch it to fit my faucet by using hot water to warm it up, slip it on the faucet, then switch to cold water to set the size firmly. That's great. The problem is when I use hot or warm water in the load, then the hose usually falls off & water just runs. So I've learned that when I use hot water, just stand there while it fills up - approx 8 minutes. Hot water also causes the lint filter cover to come of during wash. But again, that's just plastic getting too hot. To be fair, the instructions say not to use very hot water & I'm guessing this is why. For me, that's not a reason to not recommend this unit.",
