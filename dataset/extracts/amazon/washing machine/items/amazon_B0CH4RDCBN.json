                "reviewText": "I received the mini washer today. Could hardly wait to use it. I put 4 pairs of undies in. They came out clean & smelling good. The noise wasn't too loud. CONS; took forever to put basket together. Put small basket thru larger one, then it clicks into place. Directions very vague. Had to cut a paper plate to size for top of basket. Otherwise, the clothes spin right out of basket and shakes real bad. No lid came to insert in top of basket. Spin worked pretty good, just came out a little damp. Just had to squeeze a tiny bit of water out by hand of clothes. Doesn't hold much, but for socks & undies, does the trick. Had to watch a vedio to see how to get basket out, after struggling to remove it. Didn't receive the free little mesh bag, others comment about. All in all its a pretty nifty little washer.",

                "reviewText": "The washer brag works great. I like the washer bag because I can wash items that say no machine wash inside of it. I have some bras made of stocking hose material that say handwash only because the pads and other pieces could be torn off, I know because I did wash in the machine and that happened to mine. So I ordered this bag and I washed one of them in it as a trial and it come out nice and clean and the pads were still intact and all the clasp were all in order. It is a good value and saves you time from handwashing everything and I recommend highly.",
