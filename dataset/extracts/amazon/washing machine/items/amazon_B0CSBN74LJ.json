                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It works very well, it's also very easy and convenience to use, the instruction is very clear and very easy to instruct. Gets all my laundry clean, and the spin dryer works amazing as well, the laundry come out of the spin dryer are almost dry so you can just hang them and all of them gets dry within just one day. Also, the washing machine is bigger than i expected, the capacity can handle a weekly load of my household laundry, definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This portable washing machine is just perfect for what I need. It weights only 20.9 lbs which makes it so easy to move around the small area where I live right now. When I first tried the wash program option I was so surprise how clean my clothing was after just 15 minutes. This is so convenient when going outdoors or camping; it just need to be connected to an outlet and it does the cleaning job for you! I recommend this portable washing machine to people that enjoy going on a road trip camping because it\u2019s a lightweight appliance that can be carried in a RV or a truck, it can even fit inside a SUV!!! The twin tub is a plus because you can do both: washing and spinning at the same time, and in just one portable device..",
