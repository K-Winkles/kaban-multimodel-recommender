Really saves space cause it folds up, and washes stuff in like 10 mins. Super easy to use with just one button, no complicated stuff. It\u2019s light and easy to carry, so I\u2019m thinking of taking it for camping. It\u2019s mostly for small and delicate items, so don\u2019t expect to wash big things in it. Sometimes I wish it could hold a bit more, but for quick washes, it\u2019s perfect. Definetly a good buy for people who travel a lot or live in small places. Great for a quick wash of light clothes!",
