It is lightweight and easy to carry. My daughter's clothes can also be washed separately without the washing machine. It can be tumbled dry after washing; it is indeed a fully functional product at the same price; it is the best priced product and is worth recommending.",

                "reviewText": "Only washes 4 ladies underware at a time. The time it takes to fill the tub, 10 min wash, drain the tub, fill the tub with rinse water and hand ring out clothes, put in spin basket, wait for spin to stop, clothes still dripping, wait to spin again you could just do the hand washing youself in half the time with less water and save electricty. With plenty of water in the tub and only 4 small items it sounds like it's on it's last legs. I would not recommend this waste of time machine.",
