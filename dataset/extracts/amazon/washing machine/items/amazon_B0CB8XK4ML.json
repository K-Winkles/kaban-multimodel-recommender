            "Attention Please:This is a mini portable washing machine designed for small items that need to be washed separately, such as underwear, socks, baby clothes, etc. Its rated washing capacity is only 0.7kg (1.55LB), and it cannot clean large items such as sweaters and jeans.",
            "Fully automatic: Despite its small size, this washing machine is different from other portable washing machines in that it is fully automatic. Once the water inlet pipe is connected to the faucet, it can automatically fill with water, drain, and even perform a rinse cycle and automatic spin (650 rpm) in standard mode.",
            "Safe:This washing machine is designed with two lids for added safety. If either lid is opened while the machine is running, it will automatically pause and emit a warning sound, making it a safer option.",
            "Program Specification:Four modes are available on this washing machine: Standard mode, which takes around 45 minutes and is gentle yet thorough; Quick mode, which takes around 35 minutes and is ideal for lightly soiled small items; Self-cleaning mode, which takes around 15 minutes and cleans the washing machine drum; and Spin mode, which takes around 8 minutes and is great for quickly drying small items.",
            "Warranty Period :The warranty period for the product is one year, starting from the date of product receipt. If you encounter any quality issues or missing accessories, please contact us immediately and we will provide you with satisfactory after-sales service."

It is also convenient to wash your own underwear; it has a self-cleaning function, which is really practical and the price is very affordable.",

Good looking table washing machine!And it is very convenient for small things, like underwear, socks, even T-shirts all over with sweat.No need to go to the washroom to pay for washing. Save water and save energy for using a large washing machine.I think it is much more useful for washing infant clothes.",

                "reviewText": "I think this is clever, and it's certainly easy to use. You'll need to figure out how to hook it up depending on your situation. It's easy to plug into the garden hose if you have a porch or balcony.The plumbing hookup is all plastic and makes me a little nervous. I really wouldn't want this thing to spring a leak while I was at work or on vacation. If installing this in the kitchen or bathroom, I strongly advise adding a shutoff valve.It really doesn't get your clothes very clean. This is the equivalent of giving your items a few rinses in the sink.It's just a soak and a gentle spin. It does not agitate. It does not remove lint, debris, hair, etc. And this is cold water only.It will absolutely not handle anything soiled or stained. I wouldn't recommend doing whites in here.It won't handle anything too sweaty. It won't handle gym socks. It won't handle a stained or soiled onesie.It's got a very small capacity. Even an XL t-shirt is too big for it. It's really for socks, underwear, hand towels, baby items, etc.It's also got a pretty bad design decision - they put the electrical plug right in between the two water lines. This would never pass any sort of US safety standards.",

                "reviewText": "I have really sensitive & picky skin, to the point where I do my laundry with different detergents and in different cycles based on where the fabric is going to touch me. I always have difficulty with breaking out if I use a face towel I wash with my normal body towel, and I hate disposable cotton rounds. This is perfect for doing a little load of reusable cotton rounds or microfiber cloths. It actually gets them clean, even when I've taken off makeup with them, and lets me do just a teenie load so that I don't have to scrounge up enough laundry to make it worth going to a laundromat.The capacity is on the smaller side, but I'd recommend this for anyone living alone or just in need of washing small things like baby clothes separate from the rest of their laundry.",
