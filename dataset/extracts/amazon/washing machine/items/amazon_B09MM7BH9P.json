                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive",
                "reviewText": "On the positive side -It does a very good job washing. It works like most top loaders and sloshes the clothes around in the soapy water, activating the surfactants in the detergent to remove dirt. You can see the dirty water coming out in the drain. If you have never seen that before, it will surprise you.It is bigger than I thought. I put in the water first - about 2/3 to 3/4 and added the soap and the Calgon. I am in a place with unfiltered hard well water so I have to buy good detergent and the water softener like Calgon or washing soda. You don't need that if you have city water or soft water.I then did a load with 3 tank tops, 2 t-shirts, 1 pair shorts, 5 days of underwear and bras (all adult large clothing).After that I tried a load with 3 pairs of sweat pants and 3 t-shirts (all adult small). I might leave out one T-shirt next time, but it was pretty good.I set the wash for 6 minutes, let it soak for a couple minutes, and then set it for 6 more minutes to handle really dirty stuff. It worked very well and the wash water was really dirty.I then filled with cold, did a 3-minute run for rinse, and drained out that water. The soap washed away and the water did not seem dirty.The drain is gravity fed, so I put the unit outside my shower and ran the drain hose over the lip. It did not drain completely out each time, because of the bump to get over the lip of the shower. At the end of each drain, I just lifted the unit up for a few seconds, using the side handles and it drained right out. Long term, I might get a board to put under it to raise it up over the lip.The next part was the part that surprised me. I left the cold water running into the tank and rinsed each piece under it, then squeezed it out and put it in the spinner. You can only do 1 pants and 1 shirt at a time in the spinner, so you have 2-3 spins per wash load. The spinner actually did a very good job spinning the clothes to not be drippy wet, and I only ran it for 2 minutes each time. As a test, I took the whole load and I put it into one of the big Nina Soft Spin dryers to see how much more I could get out. I got almost a cup of water (7oz) out of the full load of 3 pants and 3 shirts after running it for about 6 minutes. So, yes, the big spinner does get more out, but the little spinner was still pretty impressive. All the notes about balancing it are true, so I will not rehash those. Do it right, and it works right.A lot of people complain about the hose. It is flimsy and short and I never used it. I have one of those old little green spiral water hoses (not the fabric ones, the hard plastic spiral hoses) that fit right in the slot. It was already cut in the middle due to a hole in it. I put one end on my faucet aerator adapter I got at the hardware store, and pressed the other end (just the cut end of the green hose with no fitting) into the water inlet slot. It worked perfectly, with the exception that I lost the use of the bathroom faucet while doing laundry. You can always just use a pitcher or a bucket to put in the water, but plan to spend a few dollars to make something that works for you.The negative-My only complaint is that I did not pay attention to the size of it. I saw the videos and people saying they used it in their campers and such. They must have big campers. I thought I would put it on my kitchen counter and there is no way it fits there. The dimensions given on some sites were incorrect, and others were correct. I just had not pictured in my head very well what 25\" tall and 25\" wide look like. That is my mistake, not a problem of the product.",

                "reviewText": "Pro Tip: After your very first wash and drain, make sure you switch back from drain before refilling wash tub again ;)Excellent. I live in a cozy apartment. There are laundry facilities, however in these times of physical distancing and neutronic hygiene, like that I can completely control this (well much more than sharing washer/dryer in a building).It works good so far. All reviews noting the 'stunted' hoses are 100% correct. Nothing fancy, but I can see, if the fit permits - they will do the job. Otherwise, really? This isn't a big deal in my opinion because if you're setup with it in the bathtub when doing laundry and have a bucket at your disposition, simply fill that. You can fill the Giantex Wash basin much quicker that way and therefore I find more practical to use the product this way. But, as has been noted, it certainly will work connected with hoses firmly to a water source. Optionally if you have a hose on from a water source you can just fill it that way too, either holding and aiming it into the Giantex wash basin OR just sitting the end of the hose into the wash basin to allow filling.As for quality. Clothes clean. Need approximately 1/6th the amount of detergent compared to normal. Fantastic.Spinner - works great. From having experience wringing out clothes in the bathtub, this thing is wonderfully superior than that. I've stepped out of the dark ages and into the light. Already 'euro' adjusted, I use a clothes rack and no drip. Beautiful.Some more tips. The spinner needs to be coaxed into use. Google some video reviews, one lady outdoors using a garden hose to fill it speaks of *this. Be patient, she's spot on. Great tip/find.(*Otherwise, the Giantex will be rocking your bathtub and your neighbors to hell. Maybe you might want to do that... .;)Noise? Seriously, I don't get it. I know my neighbor has one and it makes LOTS of noise in comparison. I cannot speak about it though without more knowledge than the noise, but the Giantex is not noisy at all. When loading the spinner from a _full_ washer, you _must/should_ 'dumb down' the load, maybe split it or 'thrice it'.If you're still reading up to hear, fantastic. One last PRO TIP. If you have a huge pot/cauldron - something to boil a big thing of water with, you can also fill the washer with that and have an ultra hot wash done on your clothes. Word of caution here, not endorsing this because we don't want people ending up in the ICU with scalded feet...Still reading? Add a drop of white vinegar to your wash.JK",

I've seen other reviews mention it breaking down after a couple months use so if that should happen I will update my review, but so far so good. One more thing, your order may come with a slip telling you to download the app to spin the wheel for cashback anywhere between 5 and 200 dollars. Dont bother, it's a scam to get your email/info.",

                "reviewText": "Update: we bought it in April. It's only been used for light, small stuff and treaded carefully. The \"dehydrator\" is broken now. It'd probably take a month or more to get another one, ignoring the cost.Just not worth it. It works great. It washes well and the clothes come out of the \"dehydrator\" just damp.The issues are mostly information which is missing.- the electrical cord is short. You'll have to decide for yourself if you are comfortable using an extension cord.- remember to switch to \"drain\" mode when you are running the \"dehydrator\" (the spinner) or the water will build up inside and it won't \"dehydrate\"- if you balance the clothes in the dehydrator, it won't make much noise and will take most of the water out, more than I can wring out by hand- only put in enough water to cover the clothes in the washer- don't over-fill. It won't work and it will wear it out according to other reportsWe put it in the bathtub on a boot tray (https://www.amazon.ca/SafetyCare-Flexible-Rubber-Multi-Purpose-Garden/dp/B017JGAPQQ/ref=pd_yo_rr_rp_2/132-2597551-0663603?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B017JGAPQQ&pd_rd_r=3f75eac3-74af-4b02-8c25-05d5b1376e06&pd_rd_w=JvFVL&pd_rd_wg=uu9m9&pf_rd_p=7c9c5993-bcdc-433f-87eb-0125a90eb665&pf_rd_r=R0A38WHBCKRDJP215Z1T&psc=1&refRID=R0A38WHBCKRDJP215Z1T) which reduces the noise and protects the tub and keeps it from moving around. That package has two trays, so the other is kept in the other room and protects the floor from drips.",

                "reviewText": "Great washer and convenient to use UPDATE: It's been a year and a month now since I bought this washer. Still works great, I use it for baby clothes, my clothes, sheets, towels, delicates etc. After I put my clothes in the spin dryer I throw them into my portable dryer to dry them completely. This washer is a money saver. The only con I'd say about it is the spin dryer makes a loud noise sometimes and causes it to vibrate alot, I use a rubber mat in my tub which lowers the sound and stops movement of the washer. Other than that it's still kickin after a year of using it every week :)",

                "reviewText": "I love this thing. Super easy to figure out how to use. I put it in the bathtub when I'm using it - that way I can use my shower head to fill it and drain it right in the tub. I hold it down when the spinner is going just cause my bathtub is rounded and it can vibrate pretty loudly if it rocks back and forth.My only recommendation is to only put 1/2 of the clothes that you washed into the spinner at a time. It's smaller than the washer is and becomes unbalanced if you put too much in (also you don't want to overwork and burn out the motor). The spinner works super well - really dries out the clothes (~85% I'd say).",
