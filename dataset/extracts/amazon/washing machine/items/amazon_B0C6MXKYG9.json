The cleaning cycle works great but the draining cycle, I can not tell you because it wobbles so much that I had to turn it off. Maybe it's because I'm missing a suction. I feel like it would do good. This is easy to operate and is great for washing under garments or just one piece of adult clothing, you might can fit two children's. I like how it is collapsible. I am giving this a 4 star rating because mine came with that small missing part (suction cup) that was important with the whole process of washing and draining the clothes. I will try to find some suctions that fit but not only that but maybe or a little bigger.",

I also use it to wash my husband shorts that he uses to work outside on the yard and they came out clean. Perfect to take on car trips if you have children and do not want to carry too many shirts, socks or underwear. I wish the time settings were a little longer but not a big deal. Definitely is a nice addition especially on trips. I absolutely recommend it!!!!",
