                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is an excellent washer with surprising capacity",
                "reviewText": "This is my third of these little washers, and easily the best. This particular machine is unbranded but very good quality; sturdy but lightweight, easy to use and not particularly noisy. These are not like the silent full-size home washers, so don't expect that, but they're not jet engines either. It's not annoying at all; probably similar to a dishwasher in terms of noise level.I would have gotten a higher capacity machine (20+ lbs) from the start if I had known that yes, it really does make a difference in how much you can do and how clean your clothes get. My last was 18 or so, and the extra little bit of space changes everything. Somehow the case dimensions are about the same as the last (very manageable), and it's easy to lift.I use a 5 gallon bucket to fill it; much faster than the small hose, plus you don't have to look for a special connector. What I've learned: these things need to be on a level surface or the washer belt rubs and burns out quickly. Do not overload it; fabric needs some water circulation to really get clean. The most difficult adjustment mentally is to not overdo the detergent. This machine's rotation is very strong and creates a cool whirlpool effect, so it sudses up with very very little. A teaspoon is probably plenty, as crazy at that sounds. It's been horrifying to see how much soap residue is present in my items, especially towels. I've been using way too much. You might also need to do two rinse cycles for a while until the residue is fully cleared out of your things. The washer drains quickly and the spin drum rotates at a very high rate but stops quickly too. The timers seem to run a little fast, but just set them to the highest time (15 for wash, 5 for spin) and it's plenty.Having a machine at home is a total game-changer, especially since you can easily pay $12+ to wash and dry a large load at the laundromat; not to mention the time and hassle involved in getting there, waiting, and getting home. This thing pays for itself in 10 weeks. It's a phenomenal price for a quality product that will make your life so much easier. 10 stars, 100% recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Like many Apt. Dwellers w/ clothes washing facilities on site, I experienced the horrors of doing laundry there: absolute mess/dirty...machines not working, and of course the Cost!! Enter the Portable Washing Machine. The idea of being able to wash clothes at home essentially for free, (I don't pay for water, so just detergent and electricity) was compelling enough to warrant a go. I settled on this guy the Spurgehom Mini Twin Tub Portable Washing Machine and man oh man, I am so glad I took the chance.This is a 20lb, (overall) washer/spin dryer combo which works out to 12lbs wash, 8lbs spin/dry. Doesn't sound like much but in practice I was able to wash and spin dry everything from jeans, cargo shorts, lots of t-shirts, kitchen towels, boxers and socks...Not all at once mind you but still this guy rocks! Washer is very efficient with a strong reversing agitator and the spinner is nothing short of awesome spinning most clothes almost completely dry, exception being jeans and cargo shorts.Draining is easy...I used a bucket to drain into so no problem there. There will be some water that stays in the outlet hose unless you lift the machine up to a height above the lowest part of the hose drain.Couple of points of note:1. Run a 2nd \"rinse\" cycle with clean water after draining the wash water. I use 3-4 gal of water per load. I used my hands to push the clothes around the water to get a good rinse.2. Pull the clothes from the water and squeeze as much water out as you can before putting them into the spinner.3. Do Not Overload spinner!!! Less is Best. You will know if you have too many clothes if during the spin up the tub really \"wobbles\"....if you get the right amount of wet clothes loaded, the spinner will wobble a bit then then hit top speed...its spins really really fast...and will literally hum!4. I spin my heavier stuff like cargo shorts, long sleeve t-shirts and jeans, twice...Then hang in bathroom.5. And voila...Clean Clothes for basically Free!Final thoughts...The build of this washer is very good, the operation is very easy and the results are super.I highly recommend this guy!!!",

                "reviewText": "It is quiet but it makes noise. If you live close to your neighbors it will be no secret that you have this machine.It washes really well on lightly soiled items. For heavily soiled items you will need to run them through a few times. It holds more than I thought it would. I have washed several loads with 4-5 t-shirts and 3-4 towels mixed in a load. Once the wash is done, you have to manually transfer the clothes to the spinner tub. The spinner doesn't dry, you will have to hang the clothes to dry or use a dryer. It spins for up to 5 minutes which takes most of the water out of your clothes so hang dry takes no time.It has settings for the time and for delicate and normal. You have to change the knob to drain when done washing. Leave it on drain when spinning, just don't forget to change it back when you fill it for the next wash.I use my shower head to fill since the fill hose doesn't fit on my faucet. I have it on a table so the drain hose goes down into the tub. It is pretty sturdy and only slightly vibrates when spinning. It doesn't move enough to fall over or off the table. I sat with it for the first few loads to make sure it wouldn't have any problems.There is slight but noticeable odor from the motors. I think it will disappear as I use it more. It might be the packaging or the treatment when it was done being made. I've had other things arrive with a similar odor, stronger on other things, but it disappeared after using it several times.Overall I am very happy with this so far. It is a great value for the price and convenience of having a washing machine at home.",
