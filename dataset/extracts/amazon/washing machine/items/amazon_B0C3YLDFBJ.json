It fits nicely in a checked bag for flights and definitely helps reduce the amount of clothing needed since you can wash small batches everyday.Pros:- reduces clothes needed for long trips- reduces cost of laundry while on travel- fresh clothes everyday- folds up pretty small for packingCons:- the spin basket gets off balance very easily and can only handle like one sock at a time.- drying clothes can take a while depending on where you can hang them. I have been fortunate to have the ability to hang clothes for drying overnight.- The hose is is basically uselessOverall, I've been able to wash everything in small batches except a couple pairs of heavy jeans. I will definitely be bringing this on all my extended trips.",
