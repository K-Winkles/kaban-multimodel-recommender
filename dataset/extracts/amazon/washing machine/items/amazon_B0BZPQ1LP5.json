                "reviewText": "This thing is perfect. If you want this to act like a $1500 washer dryer combo, you will be disappointed.This washer is a $120 washer with a spin cycle. The washer itself is plastic and that keeps the weight down. The 17.6lb version is the one i got, and it can wash a large adult males outfit with a towel (jeans... use your own discretion) at a time. The Laundry when done is clean, no lingering odors and removes dirt and grime like any other washer.I set it in my tub and use the shower to fill it (shower head with a flexible hose), it takes about 2 minutes to fill @ an approximate fill rate of 2.2gpm. so it holds about 4.5gallons of water with a load of clothes. I wash, spin, rinse, spin. And the approximate water usage is a total of about 10 gallon of water. this can be lowered if you do successive runs by reusing the rinse water for the next batch's wash cycle.The spin basket is a little small, it takes 2 spin basket fillings to complete a large load of clothes. but i was able to spin a queen size fitted sheet in it. BEWARE a queen size fleece blanket can be washed(with obvious struggle by the machine) but it cannot be spun. i would advise against it.I've had the machine for 6 days now, and in that six days i've ran approximately 20 loads of laundry through it. I would estimate this is about 10 full size washers worth (when loaded like you SHOULD load a washer) or about 5 full size washer loads (when loaded like a college age male)10/10 would suggest for anyone who lives in an apartment that has a tub, and is tired of spending damn near $5 dollars a load to do laundry. Also could work nicely for the camping/hippie crowd. this thing could run off a 300w inverter in a car, or with some solar panels.Tips: When loading clothes into the spin basket, gently push down on them to squeeze out some water; this will make it so the spin is balanced and doesn't shake like crazy. The amount of soap needed is much smaller than one would expect, more soap doesn't necessarily mean more clean.An accordion style folding drying rack will hold 1-2 loads of this washer. the second load, depending on the laundry washed, will be a tight fit on them though. Use your own discretionFinal warnings: the spin basket lid is tight AF and unnecessary mostly. but make sure larger things are on top of smaller things if you choose to go without. Fishing a loose sock out of the spin basket basin is a real PITA.",

                "reviewText": "Live in a 3rd floor apt with no w/d connections so hauling up and down laundry was a pain! Decided to give this a try. The machine part is powerful even though you wouldn't expect it to be but it turns the clothes well. It is not too loud either which is great too. The side that strains the clothes is super tiny so you do have to \"dry/ring out\" in small batches. It comes with a plastic lid type piece that goes in over the clothes for the drying part but it is a pain to bend and pull back out so I don't use it at all and it is fine. ISSUES that you may have. You need to set this on top of something- having it level to the ground is weird because of the drain hose being so low you need something for it to stand on so it can drain down water. Hubby built a small stool shelf about a foot off the ground and added wheels to it to slide to and from the sink to fill up. I just drain it into a 5gallon home depot bucket lol it works and I don't mind. My half bath in my bedroom is just too small for me to have the washer in the bathroom to drain in the tub so if you have the space you don't need to bucket to drain. We did have to find an attachment for our sink though because the hose would not fit it is smaller than the one the apt sink came with. All in all I love this little washer I don't mind the bucket draining or wheeling it over to the sink area when I use it to fill up. I can wash 5 shirts, several socks, undies all in one load. it holds a lot. only thing is jeans I only wash 2 at a time by themselves. Its a great buy and works for us. No more trips downstairs. I hang the clothes to dry and it works fine. next is the mini apt dryer to set up on my back porch :)",

                "reviewText": "Living in a small 500sqft apartment with a dog, a cat, and your partner means things get dirty FAST. Between the clothes we wear, the constant cleaning (and the rags involved), and the sheets and blankets that pets lay on, this small household produces A LOT of laundry.The laundromat in our apartment complex is expensive, inconvenient, and frankly, gross. We try to avoid visiting it as much as possible. Going once a week costs us about $25, and the clothes don't even come out clean. After trying several approaches to reduce our trips to the laundromat and experiencing two consecutive months of completely running out of clean laundry, we finally gave in and purchased this machine.What I don't like about this machine:The instructions are translated very poorly and are not helpful.The inlet hose and power cord are short, and the hose is also too narrow to fit most faucets.The spin side is a lot smaller than the wash side, so a full wash load takes a while to spin.To get around these drawbacks, here's what we've found that works for us!Since there's nowhere convenient enough to keep the machine permanently, we use it every 1-2 days to avoid a pileup of laundry. When we use it, we place it in the shower. This allows us to drain the machine directly with no spills and fill it up using our shower hose. If you don't have one, I would suggest getting a 5-gallon bucket to fill and drain the water.You don't need much to clean your clothes. There's too much detergent in Tide Pods, so liquid soap is better to avoid waste and soap buildup in your laundry. Run the machine using a wash cycle, then spin twice. One spin cycle filled with water to rinse your clothes, and the second cycle to actually remove the excess water. Make sure that your washer is kept in the \"drain\" setting when spinning!I would also recommend buying a drying rack with this machine since clothes come out about 70% dry.This machine is definitely a worthy investment. Not super glamorous, but a LOT more sanitary, convenient, and cost-effective to wash your clothes this way! I recommend everyone gives it a shot.",
