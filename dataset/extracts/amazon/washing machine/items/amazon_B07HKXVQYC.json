It came packaged securely and was easy to assemble the bottom panel. Like other viewers, I did vacuum out all the loose Styrofoam pieces so they wouldn't later end up inside the parts of the machine somehow. As soon as I unpacked the machine and got it ready to install to my kitchen faucet with the Danco 10512 Garden Hose Adapter, 55/64-Inch 27 Female x 3/4-in GHTM, Chrome which I purchased based on another reviewer suggestion, I found this 10512 adapter did not sit very deep and securely into the water inlet hose. It fit perfectly onto my faucet but due to a smaller end that goes into the hose and the way the hose is designed, it was almost impossible to connect to the hose. So off to the local hardware store I go to find a more suitable adapter. This adapter Danco 10513 Danco 10513 15/16\"-27M / 5/64\"-27F X 3/4\" GHTM or 55/64\"-27M Multi-Thread Garden Hose Aerator Adaptor, Chrome (see photo) works so much better and seals tightly to both the hose and the kitchen faucet.Hooked the machine up and ran a short wash with a tiny bit of liquid detergent and a quick rinse to get the pungent smell out of the machine (hopefully). The drain hose u-shaped elbow device that is meant to hang the drain hose over the sink was useless on my kitchen sink because my sink is not at the very edge of the counter top but sits back a little further. The u-shaped elbow is not very large allowing it to hang into my sink as designed. Therefore, I removed the u-shaped elbow and just tied the drain hose to the water inlet hose with twist ties. (see photo) I will eventually try to find something to easily clamp/unclamp the drain hose to the water hose when in use or just use a zip tie to hold them together to ensure the hose doesn't go flying out of the sink when draining and spinning.Everything looked fine, so I grabbed some laundry. Some of the other reviewers may be exaggerating a little about how much you can actually fit into this machine and expect it to be cleaned properly. I was able to fit maybe a 1/3 to 1/2 of a load that would fit into a normal older style top loading machine, which is fine for me since I am single. Then starts the issue of water flowing onto my floor and I was not pleased with that. My floor is tile so it was really no big deal except that it was a lot of water and pretty inconvenient. This didn't happen the first time I ran the rinse cycle mentioned above so needless to say I was concerned. After some tedious troubleshooting, I figured out what the issue was. I have really strong water pressure and if the water pressure is on too strong, the water tends to go into the machine too fast and erratic and drip onto the lip of the top of the tub. (see photos) The lip is not very thick and the water was filling up the drain hole at the top of the tub faster than it could drain back into the tub, hence overflowing onto my floor. I think Giantex could make this lip around the top of the tub a little thicker/higher to avoid this from happening so easily. After resolving this issue by turning my water pressure way lower and allowing the machine to fill slower, all was good.The clothes washed great and the rinse and spin cycles are wonderful. The clothes came out damp and not sopping wet. I then tried to wash my queen size sheets and found that I really only felt comfortable washing the flat and fitted sheets together with no pillowcases or even better yet, wash the flat sheet separately with 2 of my pillowcases and the fitted sheet separately with my other 2 pillowcases. It just seemed to be overloaded with the entire sheet set in the machine. I think I read someone saying they could fit a quilt into this machine, but I don't see that happening. I ended up doing about 6 additional loads and everything works seamlessly now. I haven't washed towels yet so I am not sure how many bath towels will fit in a single wash. However, I did run a second spin cycle on one load and the clothes came out even more dry than before, which would probably work great for towels or heavier items that take a long time to dry.Lastly, I also purchased this appliance dolly, Stalwart Adjustable Sized Telescopic Furniture Dolly Roller which I read fits perfectly. Au contraire mon ami! The smallest this dolly would go was still almost too large for the machine to set on without falling through the middle. I have a very small apartment and need the dolly to be exactly the same size as the washer. I took a hacksaw and shortened all four rods to the length needed to allow the dolly to shrink and fit snugly under the machine. Now all is great and the washer on the dolly fits snugly in its resting place and still fits under my countertop.Overall, I am extremely happy with this washer after doing about 7 loads of laundry thus far. My suggestions would be to do more research on the adapters to fit your specific faucet because it would appear the provided water hose will not fit any sink in the USA - maybe if you are hooking it to a regular washing machine/laundry hookup, it would work fine. Also, do not turn the water pressure on full blast unless your floors need to be mopped and then you can just kill two birds with one stone. Haha! Additionally, if you want to purchase a dolly, try to find one that will shrink to a smaller size more suited for this machine unless you have a hacksaw to shorten the poles on the model mentioned above.Very much a happy camper with my little R2D2 washing machine (see photo) save the few insignificant and minor design flaws. I hope this washer lasts a long time and makes me proud.",

                "reviewText": "For the money and the size, it is a great little machine. I have been using for a month now, and so far so good. Our community's laundry room is quite a distance away, so having an at-home option is great. We still use those large machines in the common laundry for large items, but the Giantex Portable Compact purchased as been great for laundering the more frequently used smaller laundry items (socks, pajamas, T-shirts, etc). It is quiet (doesn't vibrate like some front loads can), convenient, and does a good job on the laundry. Everything hooked right up to my kitchen sink (I have a Moen single lever goose neck faucet with removable aerator - and once the removable inner washer was removed from the threaded screw-on connection nozzle that was supplied with the washer (it was attached to the white hose when the washer was unboxed), ...it hooked up fine. (we went to the local hardware store with the connection nozzle and the faucet's aerator thinking we had to buy something, but the man at the hardware store showed us that all we needed to do was remove the little inner black rubber washer from the manufacturer's supplied part to reveal those inside threads - they matched up perfectly with our faucet's connections threads.) The previous Amazon reviews and suggestions were very helpful prior to my purchase, ...so perhaps some suggestions might be: don't leave the drain hose unattended or unsecured while in use (can change direction when draining if not secure). Lay a hand towel over the disconnect when taking the washer water supply hose off of kitchen faucet (still has pressure, can splash water). Then drain the 2 hoses downward into a bucket or trash can to collect any leftover water in lines before stowing. And, use a hand towel around white hose disconnect located on the top of the washer before removing - to catch any leftover water there. All in all, this is a very good little machine - it save trips to the common laundry. I teamed mine up with an (expensive) 110 heat pump/ventless clothes dryer. This machine has been a great, quiet, affordable, fit-into-small-space (undercounter) option for laundry.",

                "reviewText": "So so glad I bought this. I live in a small apartment that does not have its own laundry facility. Even if I wanted a washer and dryer I\u2019d have no space for one or anywhere to plumb one in.This machine has saved me from the weekly laundromat runs. It\u2019s not big enough to wash things like bed sheets and blankets for for day to day things like clothes and towels it\u2019s fantastic.It\u2019s simple to operate and finishes a typical wash in 40 mins. Cloths come out clean and fresh and relatively well dried considering the small size of the machine. It\u2019s only a spin drier but the cloths are just damp when it\u2019s finished, they usually can hang dry in an hour or two.I was worried about how difficult it would be to connect but I had no trouble. I just had to swap out the diffuser on my bathroom faucet for the included quick fit attachment and that was it. Hook up the water inlet pipe to that, hook the drain pipe over the toilet bowl and then connect to power. That\u2019s it.Only downside is it\u2019s not super mobile. There are spots for wheels to fit in the bottom of the machine which would make it easier to move around but none are included. That said it isn\u2019t very heavy so I find it easy enough to lift and move around as needed. Those with less mobility may struggle.Overall this is an amazing purchase and worth every single cent I paid for it. I\u2019d highly recommend it for anyone who is currently relying on laundromats.",

Comparing with the old one, this one is relative lighter, guess many metal parts are replaced by plastic parts. But it doesn\u2019t mean this one is worse. It just works as we expected, just less clothes. The noise is a little bit louder, but comes with one more option: soak, helps on washing better.So basically, this one is smaller with relative rough manufacturing comparing the old Haier model. But the price is much less. So I won\u2019t complain too much. It still worth to buy\u2026.",
