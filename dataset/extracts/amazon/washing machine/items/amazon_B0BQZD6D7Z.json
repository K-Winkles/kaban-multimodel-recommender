I would have given it higher rating if the hoses for water intake and drainage were much longer.I purchased a compact appliance dolly to sit the washer on, raised it up several inches. Plus super easy to more when I need. (Get one you won't regret it)Overall I have done about 10 or 12 loads so far and have been very pleased.",
