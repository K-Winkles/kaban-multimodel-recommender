Delivery was fast and came to me undamaged, setup was very simple and the hose attachment fits and works great no leaks and screws right onto my bathroom or kitchen faucet. There are a dozen different wash cycles all of which clean great it even has a self cleaning mode just add some washing machine cleaner in the tub and push a button and you've got a nice clean fresh wash tub in no time. The drain pump works great as well as the drain hose included. The tub size is quite large I can do my several of my bed sheets at once it can handle up to 20lbs just fine. This is a great machine for an apartment, RV, or dorm. So far I'm a very satisfied customer",

                "reviewText": "If I anything changes I will update this post. So far I had issues with the hose where it connects to the water inlet valve. No mater how tight I tightened it, with o ring and everything, it was spraying water all over the place. I was not having a good time figuring out what was wrong. Mine seems to have a fault and continues to spray. So I used gorilla tape and it's working perfectly fine now with no leaking. If I have issues with the tape, next time I'll use my waterproof gorilla tape, I just forgot where I put that one at the moment. Other than that (to me, it is a big issue, but I finally got my portable washer, so I'm willing to overlook it), so far, I like it a lot. It's exactly what I needed. Once you hook it up to a water source it's really cool because the machine allows or stops the water from entering the machine as it does it's thing and you don't have to manually shut off the water (if you are not having any leaks). I have a small portable washer that is half the size and was about $100 bucks, but you have to manually add water and do multiple rinses all manually, and it is great but with a baby now and cloth diapering, I finally decided to upgrade (it's only $100 more dollars than the smaller manual one and is fully automatic?? So worth it!!). So I would not hesitate to get this regardless of the hose issue. It's just what I wanted. I bought some rolling wheel things to put it on so I can roll it around and not hurt my back lifting it. So far so good. Oh and it's pretty noisy when on rinse, but I have a sound machine on when baby sleeps so it's not too bad.",

                "reviewText": "Very light, I got it up to the 4th floor walk up with ease, I used it for a small load, it came out very clean. I am still trying to figure out all the cycle settings. So far I am happy with it. Will update if anything changes.Update, I would not recommend the pipe are flimsy after few usages the machine leaks heavily, I am outside of the time to return but it\u2019s a waste of money. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a small load or not, short wash or long, when it\u2019s starts draining it leaks from underneath. When I checked it, you can see why the tubes are not durable, it\u2019s utterly garbage. And by the way, it\u2019s one person using it for mostly workout clothes and PJs/longing stuff. I had to just place a rug there while the wash was going on to absorb the water and thank God, I have drainage hole on the floor.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this thing because I was tired of spending $2 to wash and $2 to dry.. especially with 2 teenage boys, a toddler, and 3 cats!1st- it works. It works great! A little confusing to set up, but once you got it together, it\u2019s a lifesaver.2nd- it comes with a drain hose that pumps the used water into the sink. You can use this in the bathroom, or the kitchen! Been using this for over a month now with no issues other then it takes around the same amount of time as a normal washer.3rd- I bought a square stand with wheels from Amazon which has been a huge time and back saver. I wish this came with its own set of wheels, that\u2019s truly the only flaw I can see since I started using it.4th- you can choose your wash setting AND your water level!5th- it comes with an adapter for your faucet that you leave on (as pictured). At first it wasn\u2019t tight enough and water sprayed everywhere and I had to manually turn the water on and off throughout the cycles. If this happens, make sure the connector is TIGHT. I also replaced my water hose with a metal hose from Amazon which I recommend. Now that I have a sturdy hose and my connector is tight, I can leave the water running and the washer will stop filling on its own and start again to rinse as needed without worrying about manually turning on and off the water at the faucet.6th- this thing washes some pretty large loads for its size. I can wash a small laundry basket full in one load depending on which water level I choose. You\u2019ll get the feel of it as you use it!7th- the cycle DOES NOT STOP if you open the lid- so watch your little ones. My 4 year old wants to have the lid open all the time and jump in it \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fObviously having a regular full size washer and dryer would be my preference, especially since we use this in our kitchen which means the kitchen sink is unusable during washing.. but I couldn\u2019t really have asked for anything better. We don\u2019t have a portable dryer yet, but we\u2019ve cut our laundry costs down by half since we now just take our clean clothes to our apartment laundry room to dry!",

I think it\u2019s cute enough as washing machines go, and it seems well-made. It has a variety of settings but not so many that it\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s very large for being a small washing machine. I just do one load a week, maybe two for my one person household. The spin function is great. The clothes come out clean and very close to dry. The machine is also not super loud. And it doesn\u2019t shake or wobble. I do have a little bit of a leak where the water hose connects to the machine to fill it. Some duct tape would probably fix it. It\u2019s small enough of a leak that I\u2019ve just been drying the floor afterwards. What a relief not to have to go elsewhere to do my laundry. I love this thing.",
