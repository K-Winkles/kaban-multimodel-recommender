Collapsible4. Does not damage my delicate lace itemsCons:1. It's loud, but I think it's funny. Others might be put off by it2. The button doesn't work and half the time I have no idea what time it's going to set for because I have to press the button repeatedly just to get it to start3. It drains into a compartment underneath the spinner that you can't access so I'm always worried it's dirty or moldy in there. There's no way to clean that area or make sure it's dry when being stored. I usually rinse the whole thing with white vinegar and let it drain through and hope for the best.Really though, it's lasted a lot longer than I thought it would and has helped my delicates stay pretty pristine. It cleans them a lot more thoroughly than hand washing ever did and saves me a lot of hassle",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve liked this portable washer so far, and I\u2019ve had it for a little over a month with 2 loads run through. The first time I used it I just did socks and a bra, the second time I\u2019ve used it for a swimsuit and socks.Here\u2019s what I like:- it\u2019s quick! I usually do 2-3 ten minute loads with the last load as a rinse with just warm water- it\u2019s small. Great for folding up and taking on the go (though I haven\u2019t yet- I do plan to!)- gets things clean! Obviously that\u2019s the point of a washer, so it does get your clothes clean- the water does come out dirty.Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t like:- after a load, the dirt/dirty water doesn\u2019t get completely out. It makes me feel kind of icky that it just sits there and cleaning it is a pain. I just turn it upside down & do a rinse cycle with nothing in it.- because it takes a couple of ten minute loads to get things clean (depending on how dirty something was), I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for camping or somewhere where you have limited resources- I don\u2019t really think the soap gets all the way out. I rinse through with warm water because of this and do a ten minute cycle of just water to rectify that. Even then, I did notice the first time my socks air dried they were board stiff, so I\u2019d keep that in mind.Bottom line:I\u2019d get this again, and I quite like it. I got it to wash reusable pads, and I think it\u2019ll work just fine for that when I need it. Also, if anyone\u2019s confused like I was- you swipe to get to the 10 or 2 minute cycle- not press. It\u2019s a neat little thing and it works like it should.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a small washing machine because I was tired of handwashing!Found this and it does the job.Pros:- Foldable/compact, I can store it away easily- Easy to pull out to its full size (Was afraid it would be difficult but it is not. I was also afraid it would be weak but the structure is sturdy)- Timer button options are simple and easy to understand- Different time options which is useful for different load sizes or a rinsing option- The spout at the bottom for easy drainage!- Suction cup bottom to keep in placeCons:- You do hear it when it is running- Lid is just a top cover does not lock or secure- I do wish there was some kind of cover for where you plug in the cord to avoid water going in when filling it up.The cons I am fine with especially at this price point. Overall I am enjoying this washing machine.",

You don\u2019t need to put too much laundry detergent when washing, just a little is enough. The washing machine itself has a sterilizing function, which saves water. The sound of washing and dehydration is not loud. It is much more perfect than I imagined",
