                "reviewText": "This machine is great in all the ways people have described it in the other reviews (washes well, quiet, good capacity, etc...) so I will just say that those things are true and move on to some other things about the unit. :DThe construction is very well done and the strange amber colored top is actually really stylish and practicle in practice. I didn't expect to like that color because it is kind of out of the ordinary, but it actually looks really nice in my bathroom next to the sink as odd as that sound. lol The next thing I'd mention is that the machine is really simply made and super servicable. Others had mentioned that there was a tube that came undone from the basket assembly, so I wanted to verify mine was going to be good. There is a service door on the back of the unit that comes off with 4 screws. I can definitely see why they thought that the hoses might have leaked... the assembly really moves around when it's washing! I my case though it looked really secure and seemed to have some glue as well as a spring time hose clamp. I actually think a spring type is a really smart choice because I feel like the vibrations of the motor could wiggle screw type clamps lose. I think there was plenty of space for both though, so I will probably throw on a screw type hose clamp behind the spring clamp to be safe.Ultimately, I think it is an incredibly well executed, incredibly functional washing machine that is sturdy and will last me a lot of years. At the same time, keep in mind that it is essentially just like any other washing machine and failures in washing machines tend to result in leaks/flooding. No washing machine will avoid this, that is why they have a drain/drain pan below them in laundry rooms... so try to plan for this. I'll be adding a water collection pan below it with a little flood sensor to warn me when something is wrong.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Panda washing machine is really wonderful. Great size for my apartment bathroom.1. Super quiet. I was so surprised at how powerful yet quiet this machine is. Unless you are right next to it, you don\u2019t hear it during any of the cycles. (see video)2. Strong pump. Water flows right out during the 2 rinse cycles & spin cycle. Clothes are barely damp when wash is done (see photo)3. Controls are easy to understand & use. Multiple water levels to choose from. Multiple functional options. I like that it flashes the time remaining & cycle code throughout the wash.4. Easy to hook up to my bathroom sink. The adapter is easy to couple/uncouple & it\u2019s 100% leak proof. No issues.5. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Cleaning. First rinse cycle, water is dirty. Second rinse cycle, water is clean. Spin cycle, water is crystal clear. Super job washing.The one issue I have is the hose will fly out of the sink while draining if you do not secure it somehow. I saw a review where the used a pot cover to hold/weigh down the hose in the sink. This is a good temporary solution for me.( see photo) I will be looking for some kind of weight that I can secure to the hose as a permanent solution. If Panda can solve this problem, the machine would be perfect.I bought the Washer & Dolly package. The dolly\u2019s wheel struggle with the 50# machine. Does not roll well. I have to lean into it to push it the 4ft to the sink & back. It\u2019s ok, but not great. Just an fyiI really love my Panda Washer. It is going to pay for itself in offset laundromat costs within 6 months. I am so happy I can do my laundry at home, now. This machine has easily handles daily clothes, a load if towels & a load of sweaters, no problem. It\u2019s a workhorse.Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I live in an apartment without washer/dryer connections. About 4 years ago I purchased a portable sink washer (The Laundry Alternative) and a small unit Panda dryer. I had so many issues with the washing machine and when I found it was time to replace it, I looked at my dryer that was more than reliable and decided to order this washing machine. For one, I also ordered an upgrade on my dryer too.1. Easy installation. However, the draining tube is designed to go on a utility sink and hang directly off of it so with some maneuvering and duct tape rigged it up on my sink just fine. I don't move it from the sink I use for my laundry room so it's fine where it is. I don't see that being a problem for everyone but I'm special so......2. The connection to the sink -- the faucet was no issue but hooking onto the machine had a slight issue because it has to be super tight so as to not leak. It did leak out a small amount and so we had to tighten it up.3. The floor is uneven but it has adjustable feet and so it is not an issue.4. This thing has space galore, the tub is as big as the washers in my apartment laundry facility. I have to use the water level at 3 so not to fill up my sink and have overflow but if I were to use a kitchen sink or utility sink instead of a vanity sink it wouldn't be an issue.5. I totally forgot the washer was going it is so quiet compared to the other machine. Completely awesome.5. This machine has so many more functions than other portable/sink washers. It has a soak cycle.... it has a compartment for fabric softener instead of having to stop the machine at a certain point in the cycle.6. The lint catcher -- OMG -- the other ones always have this little net baggy that hangs out to catch the lint but eventually tears off and you can never find replacements for those parts and all the lint catchers you throw in with a cycle suck.... BUT this one is a rectangle box that will not tear off, and can only be broken by being too rough with removing it. So happy about this you just don't know!!7. The lid is super cool, it folds in so it's not in your way. It also won't let the machine run with the lid open which is great especially if you have young kids around. The lid is also well above the action so it doesn't get dirty from the wash.What can I say I love this machine and am really overwhelmed with how great it is!",
