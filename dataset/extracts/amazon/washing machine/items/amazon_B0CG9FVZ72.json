I tried drying out the pail and trying again a few hours later, with the same results. I also tried flipping the round suction cup bit around so the opposite side of suction cups was on the bucket - same result. I also tried to mount it on the side on the pail. The suction cups dont even stay in place long enough to plug it in. Not only do the majority of the suction cups not suction to the bottom of the pail, but the 2 larger suction cups that are meant to hold the cord in place dont stay suctioned for more than 2 seconds. Absolutely do not recommend.",
