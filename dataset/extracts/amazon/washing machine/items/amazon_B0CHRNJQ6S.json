                "reviewText": "I ordered the Outspurge full automatic washer about three weeks ago, and received it in less than a week. From the photos, it looked nearly identical to the machine that I had for nearly five years, but I ordered a larger size. There was some confusion over this. When it arrived, it was not any taller or wider than the 1.34 Cu Ft unit that had died. I felt sure a mistake had been made, and the seller very graciously offered a full return. After \"Re-shopping\" for another machine, I realized I may as well keep and try this new one.Nice surprise - the tub IS bigger! Even better is that the speed and power of this machine surpasses the old one. It spins out better, does a nice job of washing, and even collects lint in the lint trap more efficiently. My only dislike is that the water input hose is rather short, but as I kept the old one from the broken machine to use the adapters for the kitchen sink, I discovered it fit perfectly! here's hoping for another five years.",
