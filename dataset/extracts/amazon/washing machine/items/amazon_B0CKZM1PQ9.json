Personally, I would not get this machine as a replacement for an actual washing machine but it's decent for pet items or on the go use.What I like:Perfect size for when you don\u2019t want to do a load of laundryThe machine collapses when not in use, which is great if you want to save space.Has 3 time settingsDecent motor speed that does an adequate job of washingWhat I don\u2019t like:The instructions weren\u2019t clear so there was a lot of trial and error trying to figure out how to operate the machine. I would recommend testing out the machine in a bathtub or sink.Doesn\u2019t provide a good way to drain. The machine does come with a hose so you\u2019ll need to be near a drain.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The way this washing machine functions is weird, and the instructions aren't clear on how it completely works. So when I initially put in the clothing item I decided to put it on a 5 min cycle, but then I upped it to 10 mins. But as the item was washing I realized that I might have to flip it myself, so I put it back on 5 mins. At that point, without warning, the water began draining out the hose, all over my bathroom and wooden floors. So of course this was upsetting. But since I wasn't done washing the item I added more water. I let the washer go through another 10 min cycle, then I waited for the water to drain. It never did. So I tried the 5 min, then the 1 min cycle in an attempt to get the water to drain, but nothing. So I finally picked the washer up over the sink, held the hose in my hand and then it began to drain. This is not how I thought or expected this washer to function. I thought it worked in the same way a normal washing machine works. In that it washes and then spins out the water, but nope. Also, even with the way I did it all the water doesn't drain out. So I had to turn this washing machine over and empty the rest of the water into the toilet. Needless to say, I didn't even try to do the rinse cycle. Outside of all that, this washing machine agitates and swishes pretty good. It's a nice size. It's easy to set up and put away. But it's not worth the headache. It's just not clear on how it totally works. The instructions do not even tell you how much water to add, and there isn't a fill line. I chose to wash a very lightweight cardigan, and it fit just fine, but I'll say that this washing machine is better suited for smaller items such as under garments, socks, or baby clothes. Based off my experience, I'll only be using this washing machine on a need to basis, meaning if I only have an item or two to wash.Btw, if it would've drained out on its own I would have rated it 3 stars, but since it didn't I am rating it 2.5 stars. Also, the cord isn't that long, so you're limited to where you can use it.",

                "reviewText": "Having the mini washing machine is pretty great for road trips and overnight trips with the kids. It's a great backup machine in case you need to wash something while in a small hotel or place without a washing machine. There's two modes on the washing machine that determine how long the run cycle is. The machine does an adequate job of cleaning clothes but there's no instructions on how much detergent or soap to use. I've used a small pump of dish soap while on-the-go and it seems to work well. Or if you're just washing some beach-wear, I recommend just running a cycle with water only. There's a drainage hole where you can attach a tube to drain the water more easily or you can muscle it out and pour it out from the top. Overall, this isn't a machine to replace a real washing machine. But a great travel tool in case you do need to wash something on-the-go.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this is a foldable washing machine, which means it spins to wash your laundry, it literally spins to wash. It does a good job, as we tried with regular detergent, and the new paper type of detergent, the result was to our satisfactory, but we did multiple wash to ensure it is clean. It recommended only underwear and socks those kind of light load, and we followed the direction.But just like doing laundry anywhere, somehow you have to dry the clothes, when we first order the device, there is a picture showing it comes with a draining basket. It DOES NOT come with a draining basket, which render it doing half of the job, what do you call something that only does half job? It's like you are going to bake a cake, you have all the ingredients ready, and about to turn on the oven, and wait, it does not bake your cake. After running through the wash process, you are left with all wet clothes, and the manufacturer expects you to drain the water with the drain pipe, seriously, does it drain?It folds down to occupy a tiny space of your luggage should you decide to travel with it, but as we are trying to point out, it does half of the job, if that's what you can live with, you should be prepared to drain the wet clothes manually or 3D print a draining basket if you know how to make one. Would not recommend. At this price range, there are other options that does come with a draining basket that completes the process of washing your clothes.",
