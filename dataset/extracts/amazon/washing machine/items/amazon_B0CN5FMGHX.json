                "reviewText": "This washer will effectively clean small items. I have used about a dozen times. (I will update my review if my opinion changes.) It works on all three settings (3 min, 5 min, and 10 min.) For the 5 & 10 min settings, it alternates the circular direction. On the 3 min, it rotates continuously in one direction, and this is to be used as a spin-cycle to remove some of the water. So far, it worked great for me, provided that I kept the loads very small. I have not washed anything too heavy (like a thick sweatshirt, for example) because it seems like that might be too taxing on the motor. For small loads and individual adult-sized items, though, it worked well! It is ideal for undergarments, socks, washcloths or rags, baby cloths, or other lightweight adult-sized single items.Examples of some of the adult-sized items I washed (in separate loads:)- A few pairs of socks and 2 underwear. (Handled this load very well)- A lightweight large T-shirt and a sports bra.- A large long sleeved T-shirt- A pair of yoga-pants- A XXL men's cotton T-shirt that I sleep in.It cleaned these items quite well, and the agitating mechanism handled them without strain, as long as I did the clothing items separately (except for the socks and underwear - these were combined and it handled them well.) When I first tried washing the XXL T-shirt, I had it combined with some socks. I ended up taking the socks out, and it worked much better.) I have not used the 3-min spin cycle yet.If you are considering this, I think the key is to understand that it is built and intended for washing small items. For that, I would recommend this washer, as it does small items and single items very well! I would not recommend it if you need something that will also handle larger heavier items, like jeans, bath towels, or thick hoodies.Some tips:- Use a large clip to hook the drain hose vertical and upright, with the hose-opening at or above the level of the top of the wash bucket. You can clip it to the handle. Now, you can leave it attached while washing, and the water will not drain out until you are ready. When it is time to drain, unclip the hose, letting it hang down to allow the water to flow out.- I recommend soaking your clothes for a few minutes before starting the machine, giving the soapy water a chance to work into the fabric and begin breaking down the bonds between the dirt and the fabric fibers. (I've read that soaking your clothes allows them to need less agitation to become clean.)- I recommend using a detergent that does not contain ingredients that create suds. This will save you water and extra effort, as you will usually only need a single rinse. Soap suds are not a requirement for clothes to get clean, and the ingredients used to create suds often do not fully rinse out. This is often what causes skin sensitivities to detergents. ( I use a powdered product called \"Nellie's\" and it works great, but there are other brands available that also do not contain ingredients that create suds.)- If you are using regular detergent that creates suds, just make sure to use very tiny small amount of it so that you don't have to use as many rinses. - If you need a way to separately wash larger heavier items (thick sweatshirts, jeans, bed sheets, towels, etc.) I have found that a 5-gallon bucket with a \"laundry plunger\" works pretty well. You can do this in the bathtub or shower, and just dump out the water, or you can find a washtub that has a drain. I have used \"Lehman's Manual Clothes Washer Plunger\" which I got here on Amazon, and it works very well.I hope this was helpful as you decide if this will meet your needs. Happy washing!--",

I put in 4 pair of small socks and 4 pair of light weight underwear and the machine sounded like the motor was struggling. I took out 1/2 the clothes and it still sounded the same. Also after it was supposed to have extracted the water I still had to hand wring water out of everything. I even ordered a second one thinking maybe there was something wrong with the motor of the 1st one and had the same results. I would not purchase this again.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the KEVOZAN Portable Top Load Machine. It comes with Cover,Drain Hose, Power Cord,Drain Basket but have mixed feelings about it.On the one hand, I love how compact and lightweight it is, making it easy to move around and store when not in use. The machine is also quite easy to set up and operate, with clear instructions and convenient features like wash time selection, use of power.The washer does a decent job of cleaning small loads of clothes, like socks, underwear, and hand towels. However, I have some reservations about its performance.Firstly, it can be quite noisy during operation, which may be a concern for those who plan to use it in a shared living space or during late hours.Moreover, I found that the machine requires multiple water load changes per wash, which not only uses up more water than expected but also makes it less efficient than a traditional washing machine. I bought this washing machine to save water when I have smaller loads- but it does the opposite.Additionally, the capacity is quite limited, making it suitable only for very small loads.Overall, I would recommend the KEVOZAN Portable Laundry Top Load Machine to those who need a compact and portable solution for small-scale laundry needs, like college students or travelers or people who have little kids.However, those with larger laundry requirements or sensitivity to noise may want to explore other options.",
