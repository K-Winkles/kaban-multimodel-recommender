                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I live in a 12 unit apartment complex with just 1 washer and dryer in laundry room that closes at 8pm, and have no hookups in apartment so decided to see if there were any washing machine options for that and after some research decided to try this one and it works quite well. At only 33 pounds it's easy to pick up and move when empty, and I think it actually washes clothes better than the old washer in laundry room. Obviously smaller load capacity and the spinner compartment only holds about 1/3 of what the washing drum does, but it spins really fast and squeezes out a bit more water than most full size washers I've used in 2 or 3 minutes.The fill hose hooks easily to both my bathroom and kitchen sink faucets. Though it's manual so you have to turn off faucet yourself before it overfills. Also manually turn on drain mode which works pretty quickly so if you have a slow drain in sink may want to drain it in toilet or shower/bath instead.Not sure how long it will last since it is light and plastic but it works great. It's big enough that I can wash everything but my king size comforter in it. My heaviest jacket just barely fits in the spin compartment though and you do have to be careful to balance the spin load. Only had it one day but I was behind on laundry after too extra long work weeks and washed 5 loads in it and am happy so far.",

                "reviewText": "I have trialed and errored this thing for 9 months so you wont have to! If you are on the fence about getting one of these washers I suggest you look them up on tiktok - you will find alot of brands and reviews. I ultimately chose this one because of its larger size AND because it has a drain pump to help push the water out (some of them only drain by gravity)First I'll start with the tricks I've learned that make this thing much easier to useSHOWER HEAD - the little hose it comes with is okay, but it takes around 10 minutes to fill up that way and getting it to stay on the sink without falling off or leaking is a pain. Getting a deatchable shower heard cut fill time to about 4 minutes.DRAIN HOSE - FIRST - its probably better to drain it in the toilet due to the amount of lint that drains out with the dirty water. If not, make sure you have a hair catcher or something over your drain so you can stop the excess lint going down the tub drain. I clogged my drain a couple times before I learned this less. i ALSO didnt realize until about a month ago that you can turn the washer over and move the drain hose from the right to the left side depending on where you want to drain it. So for a while I was moving it back and forth to fill it and drain it, but now I've got that figured out.EXTENSION CORD - the cord on this is pretty short so an extension cord will probably be neccesary.SHOWER ROD and BOX FAX - get a second shower rod and hang your clothes there, set up a box fan to speed up drying. If you get a drying rack, use it for small things or you will run out of room fast.Now the actual review - I freaking love this little washer. You do have to kind of \"babysit\" it - meaning you have to manually fit it up, run it for 15 minutes, drain it, manually fill it up and run it again to rinse the clothes, drain it, then manually spin it. But it beats always going to the laundry mat. The larger size is ideal for me because I can do about a half of a full basket of laundry at the time - i just cant spin it all at once so I usually spin half (1 to 3 times depending how much water the items are holding on it) then while im spinning the second half of the load I start refilling it with water to start the next load. You dont need to use very much laundry soap at all! I am guilty of using too much in normal machines but you need very little for this washer. Same with softener (add that to the rinse cycle). Its a little heavy because of its bigger size so its kind of a pain to move it back into the closet when im done, but if you have a larger bathroom you might not even need to move it.ADHDers beware - dont walk away from this thing while youre filling it up UNLESS you have the drain hose set up where it will drain to already. I overfilled this twice and slightly flooded my bathroom because I walked away from it without setting a timer. The good news is that when it overflows its draining from the hose, so if you set up the hose where its in the tub or toilet already, it wont overflow onto the floor.When im done with it, I hoist it up on the side of the bathtub so that the drain hose is completely below it and drain the last bit of water into the bathtub. The pump is strong but theres always a little water left at the bottom so this step is neccesary to make sure theres no water in the bottom when you put it away.I generally dont wash blankets or bedding in it (aside from pillow cases) mostly because I dont have the space to hang them to dry really. But I have seen reviews on tiktok of people who do so it might be possible! it also just depends on if the blanket would fit into the spin side when its fully wet.Ill end my review by saying this - while the washer is AMAZING - sometimes it will be easier to still go to the laundry mat if you have alot of laundry to do. It takes about 1-1.5 hours for me to do a load (with distractions and multitasking of course) so if I have a weeks worth of clothes for two people to wash, it may be an all day activity to get it done in the little washer. But I will still be using this thing the majority of the time.",

                "reviewText": "I live in an apartment with an abysmal laundry room with machines that don\u2019t work so this was a lifesaver for me. It\u2019s an arduous process but it\u2019s worth it. Your clothes come out so clean! It\u2019s satisfying seeing how dirty the water gets haha.It\u2019s compact, but fits in quite a lot. I was able to do a small load of laundry in about 40 minutes to an hour. The \u201cdryer\u201d is great too and it has your clothes about 65% dry. Tip- wring clothes out before putting it in there. You will have to hang dry it afterwards though.I would\u2019ve given it 5 stars but I have a few issues:1. I saw some reviews saying it\u2019s light, personally I disagree. If you\u2019re moving it around, you may struggle a little. I struggled a lot because I\u2019m not that strong.2. The pipes are not great quality. I resorted to using a bucket to fill it up.3. The cord is very short and I had to buy an extension cord.4. Gravity is your friend to drain the water out. It\u2019s a good idea to put it in the tub/shower and let the water drain, but back to my first point, it\u2019s heavy so moving it around is a little hard.5. As other reviews have mentioned, there is a weird smell while you use it. Make sure you have good ventilation. Nothing to be too concerned about though.6. The water doesn't fully drain out. Tip- after you're done using it, make sure to use a dry towel to wipe it down and leave it open because you don't want moisture in there.If you\u2019re on a budget or you just want a smaller washing machine, I would definitely recommend this one. I\u2019ll update this review if I have anything more to add.",

I was our clothes, towels, and diapers in this machine! It does an excellent job, is exactly as described, and makes my life so much easier than going to the laundry mat! and more affordable considering how much washing costs at the laundry room! If you do not have the ability to have a standard residential wash machine I highly recommend this one! You don't need anything different than your standard sink to make this happen in your living space! Happy I went with the biggest option because I fit more clothes at once but it still fits nicely in my small space! Highly recommend. Happy Washing!",
