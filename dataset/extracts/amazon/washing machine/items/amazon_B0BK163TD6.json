It's made apartment life a lot easier and cheaper. My clothes come out just as clean as any other washing machine. The little spin wringer dries things out fairly well so if I hang dry they can be dry in a few hours. If I take them down to the machines it takes about 30 minutes to dry what would be considered a regular load of laundry.",

It's easy to store if you live in an apartment, it gets your clothes clean, the dryer part works amazing, it gets my clothes at least 85% dry and air dry the rest. The only thing I worry about is if my neighbor can hear the vibrations below. I put a Matt underneath the unit when in use to hopefully help with that. I say it's worth it!!",

Maybe a screw got loose during delivery. Reach out to company for a replacement. However there conp a ny failure to respond in real time, using computer generated questions to my problem not solving any thing. I am annoyed by this company. Give me my money back and take back your machine.",

                "reviewText": "This machine works well for small items. The spinner is a little noisy but tolerable. I've purchased Costway washers and noticed this machine washes clothes much better. I love the fact that it has a drainage pump so no need to elevate it as if it had a gravity pump. There isn't a filter to clean but, according to the vendor, there's a small filter under the washer drum. All-in-all, it's a good buy. I'm hoping it lasts a long time. Time will tell.",
