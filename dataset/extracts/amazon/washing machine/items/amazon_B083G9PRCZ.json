                "reviewText": "How I love thee, lemme count the ways...This fully automatic washing machine has a 1.7 cf capacity but only 1.6 cf of it should only be used if you're going to use a full load of laundry.It's a matter of Fluid Dynamics as it is the maximum capacity for a small washing machine to wash clothes for great efficiency.It works well and this view is obvious to me and very convincing. Well, there are others but for a home it works almost perfectly. So, in other words, there's no pressing down on the clothes as the soapy water covers all or nearly equally when the clothes are fully submerged that doesn't take time. Great!I find the panel on the machine, neat and handsome, the LED color blue, unusual but not alien. The nice cutsey tweeks as it sounds when selecting various features say, cold, warm, and hot for the water temperature, I found seamless and highly intuitive. I use warm water and not hot at all as the wash water is a soaking and wash medium but shouldn't take a further part in washing clothes.The use of hot water to me would break the machine and damage clothes.Ideally, the water should be luke warm or barely warm to warm in temperature. I allow the selection of laundry detergent for HE washing machines with no excess sudsy water.If I do, the machine will break. If I use detergent for very sudsy water, I mean, the machine will break!The washing machine is of high quality considering the price paid. The washing machine under normal use for a series of test runs would break after 50 washings in succession for Mechanical Entropy.This is impressive!The little tweeks and sudden switches I heard made me at first have a cheap sense of flimsiness and the feel of the top cover and the run, flimsey in comparison to the last machine I have, a Haier. I first hated this latest version of the washing machine from Panda.I did not know at this point that these initial superficial views and feel only meant the washing machine is absolutely brand new.The drain pump sounds a little distressing and a little loud, but works well and works thoroughly almost like the last machine I have and will always have for personal reasons.The hose attachment for the intake of water from the faucet and the drain tube are a snap and fit well, all instantly and seamlessly without putting weights on the drain hose to prevent it from going all over the place. The faucet adaptor might give a little, minor problem at first. But it's all to specs and it works without a leak. Well, maybe a little dribble, that's all. What was impressive was the drain hose! It was simply made for my sink. I just place the drain hose on the sink, the drain end of it rests on the basin of the sink and that was it! Terrific.It's fully automatic. I can go to bed for a nap or go out for a snack and it works perfectly without any unexpected spill.I'm so impressed with it, all. I also did blankets and a bathroom rug. I thought I might need to go to the laundromat which I hate to do. But I didn't need to.They all come out nice and clean, almost like new!Now, I absolutely LOVE my Panda Washing Machine! I can almost say, I can easily almost gladly pay another $100 for it. But, I'll let you decide for yourself, whether you would or not.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Packaging, Setup with a Bathtub Spout, Initial Trial and Wash Cycle",
                "reviewText": "Note that while this 1.60 cubic foot Panda washer has about the same footprint as the 1.34 cubic foot Panda washer, the weight is almost 20lbs heavier.Delivered to Upstate New York from the Amazon warehouse in Washington state within two days...PACKAGING: The 80lb box has two parts, held together by sealed bands. The top part can be lifted off, then the machine is lifted off the separate, flat bottom piece. The outer box and molded styrofoam should be set aside until the machine is tested, it is required if return is necessary. The machine, tilted backward slightly, can be rolled forward, even up a slight incline and over a small doorsill. The styrofoam that stabilizes the inside of the machine leaves bits of styrofoam, and vacuuming seems like a good idea.FOUND INSIDE THE DRUM: an instruction manual, two 4' hoses and a quick release adapter for attachment to the M or F aerator threads on a kitchen or bath sink faucet.This setup assumes that only one washing machine hose for water input is used.SETUP: (an alternate setup) - the SPOUT ON THE BATHTUB can be unscrewed, typically leaving a threaded pipe end, [1/2\", (or 3/4\"), NPT, M]. Newer bath tub spouts may be somewhat different.Amazon Marketplace has an adapter that has a, [F 1/2\" NPT end and a M 3/4\" GH end].https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD8ZWF6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This F 1/2\" NPT adapter thread attaches over the exposed pipe thread. The other side of the adapter, the M 3/4\" GH thread, attaches to the standard, F3/4\"GH washing machine hose end, or to a standard F3/4\"GH (garden hose), quick release adapter.If the GARDEN HOSE QUICK RELEASE ADAPTER is used, (recommended), one of two parts of the quick release adapter remains attached to the bath tub spout pipe adapter. The other half of the quick release adapter remains attached to the washing machine hose. Two sets of garden hose adapters, (Amazon Marketplace, [3/4\" GH quick connect]), can be added at either end of the washing machine hose - allowing the hose to be disconnected without unscrewing and wearing on the washing machine connection threads.This two pack, quick connect adapter has worked well:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085W5W8Y1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A third adapter, on Amazon, with [3/4\" M x 2], is needed to finish assembly of this set of GH quick connects to the hose ends.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BLQ6K56/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1This third adapter used between the hose and the quick release on the machine side of the hose, was also taped with three turns of plumbers Teflon tape around each side of the [M/M 3/4\" adapter].https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ITPHXZI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1NOTE: Almost all washing machine hoses have two ends that are female, 3/4\", garden hose threaded, (F 3/4\"GH). Most washing machine hoses are interchangeable. So, you can replace the included 4' hose with a longer hose.Note abbreviations: [GH/garden hose thread - NPT/national pipe thread - F, female - M, male].I looked for \"lead free\" in the descriptions of brass adapters and hoses.I used a 5' stainless steel washing machine hose, with a 90 degree right angle, also found on Amazon, and this added a foot to the hose length. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K5NP845/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The adapters mentioned, in combination, have worked well, without leaks, (see two photos).During the test cycle, I found that there were TWO TINY HOLES IN THE MACHINE DRAIN HOSE. This was repaired successfully by wrapping the area around the holes with above mentioned Teflon tape and then covering the tape with plastic waterproof tape. The waterproof tape tends not to leave a residue, and is also useful to secure the drain hose.https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Crystal-Clear-Duct-Tape/dp/B00O9JNY9W?ref_=ast_sto_dpor: https://www.amazon.com/Duck-Weather-1-88-Inch-100-Feet-281230/dp/B01313DEOQ/ref=sr_1_19?dchild=1&keywords=indoor+outdoor+tape&qid=1595817448&s=hi&sr=1-19I also used a 15', 15 Amp, extension cord, with the connection to the short machine electric cord wrapped with waterproof tape and also suspended away from contact with moisture - this allowed the machine to be plugged into an independent three pronged outlet, outside the bathroom.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YJJ8V8Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1ADDED PORTABILITY, Strongly Recommended: A double wheeled, swivel, locking caster, dolly, has worked well, and been very helpful. Adjusted to 22\" x 22\", this allows a waterproof poly 20.25\" x 20.25\" pan to be placed over the dolly and under the washer. The casters can be locked, and the dolly placed flush to a wall, so the 80lb washer can be lifted slightly and placed in the center of the resilient plastic pan.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088M34ZP7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RXBTI0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A level can be used to check the balance of the machine on the dolly, and at least two of the casters have to be locked before starting the machine.Also, before testing the setup - HDPE plastic gallon water jugs have a flat side and can be trimmed easily with scissors, to create open top, light weight drip catchers. This can be attached just under the hose links with waterproof tape.FOR THE FIRST TEST CYCLE: Be sure to lock at least two of the caddy casters first.After carefully attaching the hose to the cold port and selecting cold water choice, the amount of water coming from the tub faucet may need to be increased, so the pressure is recognized by the machine correctly.(Although the hose is attached to the cold port on the machine and \"cold\" water is selected, warm/hot water can be turned on at the tap for a warm/hot wash).The drain hose can be secured by a cord tie from the shower curtain rod, so it is about 35\" from the floor and drains into the bathtub.I have used liquid HE detergent and bleach, adding both directly to the machine tub after a few inches of water have first accumulated in the tub - so the soap/bleach then mixes thoroughly before the clothes are added. Be sure to press \"start/pause\", before opening the top to add soap, clothes, or check the water temperature, level etc. Also, things to be washed, added only half way up to volume of the tub, plus choosing large wash/heavy, seems to work well.Several washes have completed smoothly, and the clothes finish the spin cycle reasonably dry. The \"extra rinse\" option has been useful to remove any excess detergent, (check the rinse water being removed by the drain hose for soap bubbles). Together with the above setup and caddy, I have been generally pleased with the clean clothes and ease of use. Seems to be a good purchase and very handy.PHOTOS added above are: - the quick connection to machine - the quick connection to the bathtub spout - the washing machine with the back panel removed - the area with a connection to the drain hose.Additional costs: About $50. for the caddy and washer pan. $10-20. for the stainless steel covered hose with a right angle attachment. About $10. for the 1/2\" NPT to 3/4\" GH, tub spout pipe adapter, $10. for the 3/4\" M/M GH adapter and about $12. for the two quick connect 3/4\" GH adapters, (all found on Amazon), Plus Teflon tape and waterproof tape adds up to about $100. spent in addition to the cost of the washing machine. Happy that the setup and the washing machine worked.",

                "reviewText": "Update August 2023: Still very pleased with this washer. We are so impressed with its functionality & usefulness. Just washed a heavy stretch futon cover and came out gorgeous.Update Sept. 2022: After 1 year plus & move to a new house the washer is fantastic. Gets everything clean, spins great & features are great for flexibility (extra rinse, delay, etc..) Best purchase I've made in recent years! First review upon setup-will update as needed! The machine arrived in perfect condition - grateful after reading about dings, dents, etc.. set up was super easy. It took me a few minutes to get quick connect onto our bar sink faucet but after removing buildup on the faucet, it went on fine. Blew out hose as directed and hooked up to sink. Definitely need to follow up with wrench after hand tightening. I tied the drain hose and water supply hose to the faucet to avoid slippage. Ran a test load with just a few articles - they were super dirty and we are so impressed how clean they got with a small quick wash. The machine is quiet throughout the cycle. We bought a metal pan ( rabbit hutch pan, $22) and an appliance dolly (Amazon, $21) since we need to move it just outside of the kitchen area when not in use. It is super easy to move with and without the dolly. We are still recovering from February freeze, burst pipes and rodent problem. This machine will make our lives a bit more manageable. I can't remember ever being this excited about laundry.",

                "reviewText": "From the minute this washing machine arrived on my door step, it was being used.10 loads later, it has become the most useful purchase I have ever made, keeping $20 in my pocket instead of putting it into the landlords.There is some noise when it's washing or spinning, but not so loud that you can't hear the television over it. The modes also took a bit of getting used to, but once you figure out the button combinations for what you want, you can walk away knowing your laundry will come out clean.Left side of the dispenser is for detergent, tablespoon of the liquid type works. I don't use fabric softener, so don't know how well the dispenser works, but that goes in on the right.Cold water hook up can be used for cold, warm, or hot water from a single tap.Handled 3 full towels with ease, and probably could have taken 2-3 more in the same load.If you don't see an edited review in a few months, this thing is still going, and saving me money.1.5 Year Update: It just keeps working and doing its job. I've done hundreds of loads in this washer and nothing has broken or stopped working on it. For an apartment dweller this is the perfect washing machine and saves you money especially if you use drying racks.",

Get ready - this is going to be an unsponsered and honest review.This thing comes up to the height of a regular kitchen coutertop. As wide as a kitchen sink and a quarter/half.Suuuuuuper easy to install - it comes with all the parts. You only need a screwdriver to install the bottom cover.It can totally launder your clothes and thinner blankets. It cannot handle a duvet of any size. It can wash pillows - one at a time, horizontally in the machine. It cleans surprisingly well considering the agitator doesn't stick up and out like your every day non-portable top load washer.I don't love the speed of the spin while washing. I feel that it doesn't spin enough, but the clothes come out nicely clean.You can use hot water. It's easy to move around as it has a wheel and handles on each side. It drains REALLY well. The spin on the spin cycle is incredible. The clothes, towels, curtains come out very nearly dry.You don't need a lot of detergent. It is REALLY quiet. It won't disturb anyone. The buttons beep when you press them but it isn't a terribly high pitch, loud sound. Just a regular beep.It isn't heavy and the handles help with moving it around. It doesn't use a lot of power. I have two air conditioners, all lights and elecronics on while I run it without problems or blowing a fuse in my apartment. It's absolutely worth every penny. I will update this review in a few months.",

                "reviewText": "Comes with 3/4 connections on both ends of the included hoses and the faucet adapter doesn't work with sprayer faucets, so i had to buy hoses with a 3/8 compression on one end and tee off the 3/8 water supply to the faucet. It works well but the water seems to splash a little bit off of the drum sometimes (EDIT: It was because the powder was in a pile and flattening it out fixes that as well as making sure the drawer is fully shut) on the first fill for the wash cycle if it is tilted slightly the wrong way after loading clothes and my wife though it was leaking at first. Couldn't find any support information for this company anywhere, not even in the manual that is included. Funny that it says 'before calling for service' in the troubleshooting while not including any contact info or recommendations whatsoever to follow up with. The detergent drawer seems to be different from the one depicted in the manual and seems to have two compartments, one apparently for fabric softener, while the manual claims it is only to be used with powder. Make sure you have it inserted properly because this is where the water is dispensed from as well. Liquid works fine but make sure it is HE detergent. The drain hose could be better quality but it will do for now. MAKE THE DRAIN HOSE IS SECURED SO YOU DO NOT GET WATER EVERYWHERE IF WASHING UNATTENDED. Be sure that the machine is level too. If you carefully follow all the necessary steps the machine works well, but it's not difficult to do something wrong and have an issue. It can be fickle.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this washing machine. Since I've gotten it I've only used it a few times but everytime has been great! I actually find it cleans my clothes better than some older washing machines. The noise level is very low and it shakes less than an older washing machine, it actually doesnt shake to the point where things around it vibrate. Before the first use I did level the machine by just screwing the adjustable nobs at the bottom (which is what makes the difference). For loads, It surprisingly fits a lot, that was one thing I was nervous about. The only thing I haven't been able to wash is a big comforter. Besides that's I've been able to do 2 sheets, 4 pillow cases, and 2 sets of pj's in one wash (to give an idea). Honestly it's worth it for a single person or a small place. It is not hard to move around, as you can see in the picture I place it facing the wall when I am not using it because the wheels are at the back so it's easier to get out this way. I also provided a picture of it's size compared to a standard stove. Hooking it up to the tap is very easy as well! I also provided a picture with my hand in it to show the size.Delivery was great! I read bad reviews about the deliver service that was to deliver the package but the man working was actually great! He brought it up to my apartment (with all precautions with covid dont worry). I was very satisfied.",
