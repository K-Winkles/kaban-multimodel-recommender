                "reviewText": "Bought the front loading washer and dryer set one year ago. I called the retail store where I purchased the product a day or 2 before a Samsung agent called me to schedule an appointment to check out the problem. The retailer told me my machine was under warranty. The initial agent from Samsung also said it was under warranty. The repair man that came to assess the problem said it was a manufacturer defect. Almost a week later, 2 days before Thanksgiving, Samsung says my appointment is cancelled, they can\u2019t get the part and to arrange for an exchange.At this point, I am now told I need my receipt from 1 year ago. It is NOT under warranty because the one year was up 2 days before Samsung called me back to set up initial appointment to check out my machine.Samsung would not take any responsibility in the fact that their merchandise was defective and their parts were faulty. The agent I talked to had zero interest in trying to figure out something that could be done to fix a one year old machine. She just dismissed me and kept passing me off to the retail store where I purchased it and said my 1 yr manufacturers warranty was expired. Their 48 hour delay is now costing me another $700 for a new washing machine.NEVER WILL I EVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT and I Will see to it anyone I know does not purchase one either!They do not stand behind their merchandise.",

I have had to replace the heating element in the dryer. I have had to replace the main control board and the entire motor assembly in the washing machine. Samsung has terrible customer service when you call them on the phone and even with the 10 year warranty that is supposed to be on the motor they will not cover it. Buyer beware!!! Buy at you own risk!!! I wouldn\u2019t own another Samsung appliance if they gave it to me. To many head aches and to many day off of work to get thing right.",

After a month of rattling the dishes and windows, we had Samsung come out...and they replaced it with new washer. This one's just as bad, maybe worse. Our brand new house now has a crack in the ceiling. It took SO LONG to get the first one replaced, I think we're just going to eat the loss and buy a different washer. And I know washers, having owned a laundromat with 30 wonderful Maytags, so in my very expert opinion this is a faulty model and should be recalled ASAP.",

We use HE detergents and try to not over pour detergent. Called Samsung for service as still under warranty. Samsung sent us to Third Party company who said they dont service stacked units. Called Lowes who said they dont un-install stacked units for customers. So one month new Samsung. Complete waste of money. Do not buy. Horrible Samsung customer service. They dont service stacked units. So why they sell stacked units to begin with???? Do not buy. We deeply regret our purchase and will never buy Samsung again. So much for one year warranty. We have to pay someone to uninstall the units and service the issue.",
