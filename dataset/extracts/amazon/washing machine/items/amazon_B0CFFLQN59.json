Lets start with the cons and get those out of the way.-Shipping took a long time-Drain hose and power plug are really short.-Water inlet hose is way too small to fit any sink i'd know of.-Louder than i'd hoped.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now the PRO!-Small enough to fit in almost any space. *I use mine in my apartment bathroom*-Washer agitates really well if not over filled.-Spin Dryer is small but a god send vs wringing them out by hand.-Actually kinda stylish for a washer o.o-Drains well, washes well, spin dries well, well.... that's what I wanted <3-Easy to install and useFirst load I did was, 2 large towels, 2 adult shirts, 1 adult jeans, 6 socks, 1 kids jeans, 1 kids shirt, and 3 pairs of underwear. Ran it near 75% water for 15 minutes, drained, refilled with fresh water and ran for 5 minutes, drained and then began spin dry steps. Clothes turned out very clean <3I feel like the design could get better, not sure why it has to be separated for washing/spin dry but hey, for 120$ ish, I can just do a load of my kids and mine laundry once a day and skip the laundromat fees.I will update if it breaks within a year but it seems well built so hopefully not <3 Hope this review helps",

I can quickly wash things that are needed tomorrow morning (did I mention I have a large family :-) ), do my husbands dress clothes or simply catch up while getting other things done. We have a large closet in our bathroom that I turned into a drying closet. There is a rod in there and a dehumidifier. I can hang up a lot of clothes, make sure the dehumidifier is going and it doesn't take any longer to finish a regular load than it would in the standard washer/dryer downstairs. *Jeans and towels take 2-3 hours to dry after running through the spinner.",
