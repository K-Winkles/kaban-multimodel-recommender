The food-grade silicone material portable washer is a great choice for your personal items, baby products, and pet products. NOTE: Large items may damage the machine",

It is easier to move and store in a small space. An excellent gift for one who loves travel, and lives in school, or for families with babies, pets, and sick people",
            "\u3010Washer with Drain Basket\u3011The drain basket of the portable washing machine can make your items without dripping in 6 minutes and avoid hand-twisting, but it can't completely dry the clothes",
            "\u3010Energy Saving Washing Machine\u3011Arlyeef washer integrates environmental protection, water saving, and energy saving. It has a small load, consumes 30% less water than other washing machines, and only needs 0.005 kWh of electricity for 10 minutes of washing. Washing time from 5 or 10 minutes optional",
            "\u3010Ultrasonic Cleaning & Anti-Blue Light\u3011Arlyeef mini washing machine adopts upgraded ultrasonic high-frequency vibration cavitation to accelerate the dispersion and emulsification of liquids and stains, making your clothes clean immediately! Blue light deep washing protection is a good choice for babies and sensitive people"

I bought this because of my shoulder issue and can't wash my garmets by hand well, if u have underwear for woman and ur cycle hits DONT USE THIS. Bleach doesn't even work with it well..This is ok for rags I have animals and messes on floor of water and it helps keep those okay again dont use chemicals.. I use lemon and with a pinch of salt, it works ok.I really wouldn't recommend this product unless u need small items washed and don't need right away, so the can dry for 2 days..It took me washing my bf thin wrangler work shirt, had to wash 4 times for it to come clean.. I hope I can send back and get a refund..",

                "reviewText": "This product is very small, I can fit two adult large size t-shirts in it at a time. Most of my items I put in for the 10 minute cycle with a tiny amount of detergent, empty the water and add fresh without detergent, and run for another ten minute cycle and I am amazed at how clean and fresh smelling my clothing is. I was having trouble getting the clothing to spin without the basket detaching, but I found that if I drain the water and put it on the normal short wash cycle without water with the clothes in the spin basket that enough water will drain that afterwards they can go for the spin cycle without dislodging the basket. If you're camping, traveling, or in a very small space, this will help get your clothes clean.",
