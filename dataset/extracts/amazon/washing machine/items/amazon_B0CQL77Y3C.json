It shows you how to prep the machine before washing, but doesn't explain how to actually do laundry.4. Troubleshooting is not explained, so whatever issue you have with the machine, you have to figure out yourself. There's no YouTube videos easily found to help with installation, troubleshooting, etc.5. My machine's tubes were already filled with water upon arrival. I might have received a refurbished one. Although I paid for a new one.6. The inlet hose isn't working - again, no troubleshooting explanation or options.7. After making sure the water intake hose was properly tight on the faucet and on the machine, the machine would not fill with water. When detaching the water hose to double check my work, it sprayed water all over the bathroom.Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed with this machine.",
