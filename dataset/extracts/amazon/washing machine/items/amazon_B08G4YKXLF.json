                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with purchase!",
                "reviewText": "I use this to wash cloth pads and occasional stained undies every day of my cycle, as I have very heavy flow and my front-loading, water-saving washing machine doesn\u2019t thoroughly or efficiently clean pads without me running multiple, wasteful cycles.In the morning, with the agitator attachment in, I fill the container maybe half-full with plain water, and I add pads throughout the day (letting out a heavily-soiled water and adding fresh water if/as needed). At the end of the day, I churn and rinse a few times with plain water, then spot-treat with Ecover for stains if needed, add detergent and OxyClean and soak for an hour or so, then agitate, soak another 10 mins, agitate, then rinse with plain water a few times, change to spinner basket and spin and hang dry. The pads come out *perfectly* clean, I\u2019ve used NO electricity, and I\u2019ve probably used way less water and cleaning products!Now for some specifics.Capacity: I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to fit more than a pair of pants and a shirt (IF that) into the machine at one time. FYI unless you have a deep, basin-like sink, you\u2019ll need to use a smaller vessel (like a mixing bowl) to fill this up, and you will need way more water than that little Pyrex measuring cup in the video.Churning: this is pretty easy (watch the video- do a half-turn clockwise, then a half-turn counter-clockwise, over and over). Of course, the more you are churning, the more muscle you need to put into it. The most I filled the container was maybe 3/4 full, and it was a bit of an arm workout for a few minutes!Cleaning: I specifically purchased this machine because it has an *agitator* (others don\u2019t), and I think the agitator probably helps with really churning the items and removing soil and stains. The churning produced a really good amount of suds with a minimal amount of detergent, so I knew it was efficient. I did have a few pads where the staining wasn\u2019t removed with just soaking in plain water, and they came out beautifully with the detergent/OxyClean/Ecover treatment and the soaking/churning/soaking/churning routine.Spinning: This is very effective (I can\u2019t squeeze more than maybe a drop or two of water out of each item, after a briefly spinning twice) and doesn\u2019t take too much energy. Items dried *maybe* a bit faster than they did when I was manually squeezing them out before.Sturdiness: after seeing reviews of *other* machines, whose churning/spinning handles broke off, I made sure to be a little gentle with this (eg., pausing for a second before changing direction when agitating, instead of abruptly jerking the handle). The agitator and spinner basket seem sturdy, and everything has held up so far through several loads, so no complaints there. Note: the plastic suction cups at the bottom of the container won\u2019t stop movement altogether, so you have to hold the machine with one hand while churning and spinning with the other.Value: I am very pleased with this item and it suits my purpose, so I was fine with the price (which seems in line with other machines- though the others DON\u2019T have an agitator). I *do* think the price of all of these machines, with their small size and plastic parts, is pretty inflated, but I guess that\u2019s the market.Other uses, besides pads: I would definitely use this to wash small baby/child items that are stained and need to be soaked & washed right away, when you don\u2019t have any other clothes to put in the washer; I feel like this machine *might* even do a better job than my machine with a tiny load and stains like that. I would NOT use this for cloth diapers (I saw a review on another machine that mentioned this idea), just because the capacity is so small compared to what you use in a day, and cloth diapers are typically quite soiled. I, personally, would NOT use this for adult-sized clothing, except in a REAL pinch; I think I will stick to my washing machine for that. And I saw a clip of someone using a similar machine to wash delicate lingerie; I think this requires a bit more effort than I am willing to put in, when I can just throw these items into a mesh bag in my machine, but if you are particular, that is definitely an option.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to *thoroughly* clean smaller items while saving water, electricity and detergent.",

                "reviewText": "When I first received the ,mini washing machine I was playing with it in my kitchen before actually using it camping or what ever. I sure did have to mop the floor when I was done. Everything on the device worked as it should, its just if you put a little too much water in it, when you go to spin the clothes to actually wash them water spills out of the top. You can feel how non existent the seal is when you place and \"turn-lock\" the lid after filling it up.Other than that it worked great! I was hoping to at least be able to wash 1 shirt 1 pair of socks and 1 pair of boxers in one load and 1 pair of jeans in another load but the jeans were too much for it. When you go to spin dry them the whole thing shakes violently (kind of like a normal size washer when the clothes inside are either too many or uneven on one side). I may try again with either some thinner jeans or only use it for summer clothes I guess (shorts, cut offs, etc.)If you are getting this because you live in an apartment, id say just save a little bit more money and get one a little bigger. Sadly the more you are able to spend with these things the better results you'll have, and from my expierience they all last a pretty long time so its not like you would be buying another one again for a really long time, unless you wanted to upgrade.I would buy it again as a gift for someone I know would actually get some use out of it, but I don't think I would purchase this specific one again.ONE MORE NOTE: Buyer beware that there is another CHEAPER version of this same little washer that is like HORRIBLE quality but using the same pictures as this one. This one is the higher quality one, and the same one in the instructional video. Upon researching Ive seen people using the same video and pictures for a SUPER CHEAP looking model. So be careful and buy this one lol..",

It's a great item but not for the price it's selling. about $82 dollars. you have to be careful when you spin because it feels like it's going to break. which it did, when spinning the water leaks through the top, when drying the clothes in the bucket shakes a bit too much but it does takes out all the water. It's good for small spaces and easy to drain the water. Also it does cleans the clothes well.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I emailed the company and they sent me a new lid right away. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.I do about 4 loads per week and this is my only machine. Not exactly perfect BUT it still gets wonderful results. I highly recommend it for small people.Update: After I made my initial glowing review, the lid cracked and broke by the small handle. It still works, just doesn't spin as well bc the small handle slides around now. Fortunately, there are two handles, so I'll be using the removable one from now on. My advice is to listen carefully whilst spinning, to hear any cracking sounds and stop immediately, otherwise like me, you'll end up breaking the lid. Be gentle and mindful when using.I have done about 20 washes and I am happy with my purchase. The only thing I would ask for future models is a handle on the side bc I need a grip. Even though there are suction cups, the bottom still slides all over the bathtub, left and right and however it spins, unless I grab the tiny little white catch for the lid to steady the washer in place. Ouch, that hurts my finger tips. And bc the lid doesn't lock, only slides into place, it comes out if I spin the handle the opposite direction. So back and forth agitation doesn't work very well for me. However, I still recommend this manual washer by Khomo. A small person can pick it up and move it easily. It saves money and space. It works very well for both washing and spin-dry.",
