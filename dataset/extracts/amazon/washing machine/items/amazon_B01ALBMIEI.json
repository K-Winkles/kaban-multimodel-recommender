                "reviewText": "So I try to spend a minimal amount money. I tend to be a bit frugal; but it\u2019s by choice and I\u2019m lucky for that. So I saw the price tag and I was \u201cwishy washy\u201d (ha, get it?!) about getting this machine.We have a laundry mat down the street but it\u2019s SUCH A HASSEL! dragging it in and out and waiting for machines; it takes so long. And it\u2019s a ton of stupid quarters and public people. It\u2019s annoying and a pest to do constantly. But the idea of making a big chore into a mini chore was appealing. I wash in my work form home breaks which I\u2019m done switching and start washing within 3-4 minutes.So I was skeptical of this machine to be honest. If it\u2019s from Amazon how nice is it really? I saw good reviews and praised; and I took a risk. And I\u2019m SO GLAD I DID!pros. This machine is lightweight; compact but still pretty nice sized. I was shocked when it came in how big it is. It\u2019s just me and my fianc\u00e9 and two cats; we have a queen sized bed and don\u2019t do much. So this machine is PERFECT! It can wash towels, sheets, slippers, all work clothes (including his khakis and my thick sweaters)! Big comforters might be able to fit but an occasional blanket washing trip is better than every week!Pull out of the box and unwrap, and plug in. The easiest setup of my life. I was worried getting a machine online I thought it would be more complicated. But nope. Easy peasy :) Now you do have to be a little careful loading it; if it\u2019s not fully whirlpooling it won\u2019t clean it right. Also; SOAP. One tide pod was too much so we unfortunately did have to switch to tide liquid. But it just needs a small \u201cbloop\u201d of soap. It can get over soapy easy so just use maybe 1-2 tablespoons. That\u2019s the sweet spot.The spinner (not dryer) is very fast. It\u2019s actually fun hah! It actually gets clothes like 70-80% dry. At first I was wary: I knew this might be an annoyance. But drying clothes takes maybe 3-4 hours? It\u2019s not long to let it hang and air dry it\u2019s honestly been nice to have our house smell good!This is the first time I ever have enjoyed doing laundry. Ever. That\u2019s massive for me! It used to be so annoying and my least favorite thing ever but now it\u2019s nice to see my clothes CLEAN! And fresh. :)We don\u2019t have any hookups (but they are built in on the washer!) so tbh I got 4 cinderblocks and a 5 gallon pail (it\u2019s a gravity drain) to hoist it up; and the 5 gallon pail is ok with my bad shoulder even when full. She isn\u2019t stunningly gorgeous on her cement throne but hey, it works well and it\u2019s sturdy. And it cost under $6.Cons: this is a spinner so you do have clothes around the house. Be mindful of that. I wish it was a dryer but it\u2019s a super good spinner honestly; doesn\u2019t need to air dry long. Not a con for me but for others maybe.If you don\u2019t have hookups you will need a shower or bucket for water. I don\u2019t mind this at all (featuring cottagecore lil old me) but I know that can be upsetting to some.This machine is a little loud when spinning. Even if you balance it right it just whirrs. Now it\u2019s not extremely distracting or bad. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s there.No full lines on the wash tub. It takes some experimenting but it is a lot better once you figure it out.And weird instructions. Don\u2019t even read those just chuck em. It barely made sense.TDLR: best money ever spent. Made me fall in love with doing laundry which I normally hate. Best purchase in a very long time and holds up well. Caught up on all laundry; pros and cons above.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I have had this for a couple weeks now and figured out some \"hacks\" and tips.I place this in my tub and found no issue with that. I use our bathroom sponge to balance the machine and ease vibrations. I also went to my hardware store and bought a showerhead diverter, a 30-in 1/2\" faucet supply hose, and a brass \"barbed\" adaptor. *Ensure these all connect in the store before purchase!* Sadly, 8 forgot the hose that came with the package, but I zip-tied it a couple times to get a decent seal. I always leave a little slack so any stray leaks don't get on the machine. Makes life easier just turning on the shower and filling/rinsing the machine this way. Cost of this was $30 but worth it! I am a 6'5\" guy and I threw my back out filling the machine over and over. Plus, you can do a rinse and spin to get the suds out.With this machine, you must always think \"less is more\" and if it looks like enough, it's already too much. A decent load, to measure, is whatever can fit in the spin basket plus a one extra, light thing. When the wash cycle is going, you want to see a vortex... a whirlpool effect. If your clothes are floating and spinning at the top struggling to be washed, you've overloaded. Pull out items one by one until you get that whirlpool.You can spin and wash at the same time. The spinner drains regardless of the middle knob is set to drain, and if you overfill the wash tub it will drain whatever overflows. Plan this accordingly.Noise is compareble to an AC unit, and there are vibrations depending on where you place it and how level it is. I use a sponge balance and absorb some vibrations. Not fancy, but works.I reuse my hot water, topping off the wash tub each time. The water may look gross but it's fine as there's soap already in it. Dry cleaners reuse their chemical wash hundreds of times over and your clothes come out fine, plus you'll rinse it all. My whites come out whiter than the commercial washers too, so you're saving money and resources.I'm still very happy!***Where do I start? Well, I have spent a good portion of the few weeks looking at portable washing solutions as my apartment does not have a washer set-up, and I got tired of using the public washers in my apartment community. All the coins needed, going back and forth, waiting for machines to open, ensuring I had enough quarters at the time, and the entire day had to be devoted to laundry more often than not.So, I shopped around, reading reviews and watching videos of different machines. This one stuck out as it's reasonably affordable and does a great job, according to reviews. I live in the Bay Area and this ships for Los Angeles, so I got it within a couple days (excluding a holiday and weekend). The box was in good shape and unclipped the ties. A whiff of \"new plastic\" and staring in awe, there it was, just as in the pictures. Unboxing was easy, unclip the ties and lift the top part off. A brand-new washer!I grabbed the instruction manual and flipped through it. As other have joked on here, it's in Engrish with such gems as \"choke the dial\" and \"put staff not under.\" I tossed it aside because it's useless, most reviews give you the rundown. Here's mine, if you need it:Step 1: Place a splash of soap, no more than a heaping tablespoon's worth or the soap will take forever to rinse out. You don't need to measure, but just guess and be cautious.Step 2: Place clothing in machine, one item at a time. Sort your items keeping towels in one load, basics in another, denim in another, and so on. Fill the machine just over half full with basics. Towels and denim should be washed in smaller loads as they're heavier fabrics.Step 3: Ensure middle dial is set to \"Normal\" or \"Soft\" and fill with water. The \"inlet hose\" is useless out of the box as you need an adaptor that the manufacturer assumed you had. One end has a rubber gasket and the other end does not. The gasket end is the part that would go to an adaptor, the gasket-less end goes to the machine. Why? Because if you hook the gasket to the machine, it's harder than heck to get it off without nearly destroying the hose. During the inaugural load, I did not have an adaptor, so I filled the wash basin with a bucket. Fill just slightly over half-full, any more will splash out during the agitation cycle.Step 4: Check to see of the machine is plugged in. I forgot to do this and sat there confused. Turn the \"Wash\" dial to 15 minutes and the machine will hum to life. Let the machine do its thing and come back when it is done. It doesn't make any alarm when it's done, just so you know.Step 5: You may come back to, what I would describe as a burning smell. I was alarmed at first but nothing was wrong, it's \"new motor smell.\" Turn the middle dial to drain and the water will come pouring out of the drain hose. There is no pump, so try to have the machine elevated or set in your bathtub.Step 6: Open the spinner basin and place a few items in, ensuring that it evenly loaded (about half of the wash load). Place the plastic insert in the bin on top of the laundry, close the lids. Is the middle dial still set to drain? Good. Leave it. Turn the \"Spin\" dial to 5. If you have the \"inlet hose\" hooked to an adaptor, this is where you can do a spin and rinse. If not, you can spin the suds out and wash again in clean water real fast, then repeat the spin. The machine will vibrate during the spin, and if it vibrates to a point where you think it is too much, stop the spin cycle and rearrange your items. Everything comes out damp, not wet. Like others have said: \"About 90% dry.\"When putting away the machine, tilt it slightly toward the direction of the drainage hose to get the rest of the water out. I set the machine aside with the lids open as to prevent a musty smell in the future. I will say this: Don't overwhelm the machine. Do a couple washes and allow the machine to cool and rest for a couple hours, say, while your laundry is drying on a rack. If you overexert the machine, it will break. EEK! It's more for daily loads (every day or every other day) than for a single day of wash (\"laundry day\").It's a great compact machine that gets your laundry as clean as most large washing machines. It takes a bit more effort on your part to tend to each load, but it's easier than running up and down flights of stairs, digging in the sofa for coins, and fighting over the next machine. I plan on finding a cart to place this on so I can store it easier, and find an adaptor that will fit the inlet hose.I will update this as time goes on. It's a really simple machine, gets the clothes clean, and I am saving some money from the get go compared to the few bucks it takes each wash in the laundromat.",

                "reviewText": "What I liked: it\u2019s actually light and compact. It has a hose for the kitchen sink or bathroom sink but you need an adapter, I didn\u2019t buy it but I just put it in the bathtub and filled it with the shower head (I have a long one) and it takes 3-5 mins to fill up. I add the detergent (I use TruEarth strips) or mainly for baby clothes to clean. I think that overall I would like to have a dryer option cause in the winter I can\u2019t set a whole bunch of clothes quickly if I have to hang to dry - plus it\u2019s winter now so I can\u2019t use that, the clothes will be really hard haha.If you don\u2019t mind that, and you want to save money on the dryer than this will definitely benefit you because the clothes water wringer works really good honestly. It\u2019s not really loud either, likes average noise. And yes, the emptying of the dirty water is easier in the bath tub.Also, don\u2019t forget to clean the filter inside the wash portion of the machine - lint in there.Overall, 4/5 because I personally can\u2019t wait for the clothes to dry out and I can\u2019t find a place to store it in my apartment cause of all the other things I have (like baby toys etc) but I\u2019d still high recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying this thing does NOT supply heat - the dryer works by spinning. Additionally, anything thats high in lint WILL fill the lint trap faster, and get lint on your other clothes. You may not want to use brand new linty filled fabrics in this thing, do a few loads in a normal machine first to get some of it off, perhaps.I have been using this for my baby's clothes and linens and it's been a game changer. I don't worry about others' toxic detergents building up on her stuff and it hangs to dry fairly quickly. I have yet to use cloth diapers with this, but I already know the spin dryer will work well - you can turn cloth diapers inside out and have the waterproof lining inwards, so the spin cycle will pull out water and excess debris.This machine also gets stains out pretty well.BUT BE WARNED - if you presoaked something to get stains out, like with dish detergent and oil on clothes - rinse it out well before putting it in here. Even a tablespoon of soap is almost too much for this machine, so go easy on the soap.IDK if this happened with others, but my water inlet on one side was blocked, so when I went to use it, water splashed up and went all over the top of the machine - bad because there's wires underneath that section! Double check that water is able to flow with a funnel and a cup or something before attempting to jet water through the inlet. Due to my defect, they refunded me so I could replace the mini hose inside the part, so their customer service is pretty good, too.Is this a perfect machine? No. Is this a pretty great machine? Yes. I recommend for those with babies and communal laundry facilities.",

                "reviewText": "Only gave 4 stars as the only issue I had was the power cord is too short and the hose would not fit the faucet. I had to turn the machine in the bathtub facing toward the wall so that I could plug into the socket. And the hose would not fit into the faucet to fill with water. Just fill the machine with buckets of water, which is quite time consuming but other than these issues, the machine itself does the job and is quite powerful. I even put one bedsheet in at a time and it washes well. The spin cycle works great, the items are ready to hang up with no excess water on them. It is also lightweight so can be lifted out of the bath and shower easily to be stored away. Great machine and saves money on laundramats.",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely thrilled with my Giantex Portable Mini Compact Twin Tub Washing Machine!!!!I wash everything by hand and my rheumatoid arthritis in my hands and degenerative disc disease in my back now makes this extremely painful.I bought a stand with roller wheels that lock for easy moving.I add a 1/4 cup of liquid Tide, some softener, Lysol Disinfectant Laundry detergent and even a sprinkle of Downy Unstoppables then I add 10 liters of water with a pail (hose does not fit any of my faucets-no biggie). I put in my items I want to wash and look to see if the water/clothes reach the bottom of the lint collector. If there's more room I add more water just until the water reaches the bottom of the lint collector. You don't want to cover the lint collector.I have washed 2 sweatshirts, 2 pair of jeggings, 3 pair of socks and 3 camisoles in one load. For reference of size ratio, I wear small women's clothes. Then I just turn the washer knob to Normal and put on the timer anywhere from 9 to 15 minutes.When transferring the washed clothes to the spinner I split the load in half, turn the knob to Drain and set the timer. Whoooooa, it spins very fast and leaves your clothes, towels, bed sheets until there is absolutely no water left. You can do an extra spin if you think they could use another go around. I only spin twice for towels and sheets.I hang the items on a rack and voila in about 3 to 5 hours (depending on the material) everything is completely dry.This is my best purchase in a very long time. The machine cleans extremely well, spins furiously and saves my hands and back. Especially during COVID when I definitely do not want to use the laundry room in my apartment building. I rarely used the laundry room before COVID and the pandemic only exacerbates my fear of the transfer of germs and bacteria.Fabulous portable washer/spinner. I definitely recommend this very useful and highly functional little machine.",

                "reviewText": "this little machine is great for small spaces. However, I\u2019m in the process of returning it and getting my money back simply because the dryer does not dry your clothes at all. I live in a one bedroom apartment with a very small bathroom. There is nowhere for me to hang dry my clothes and drying them outside is not an option seeing as I live in one of the coldest cities in Canada. The machine does an amazing job at washing the clothes and getting out all the grime, but when it comes to drying it sucks. The max time that you can set on the dryer it\u2019s five minutes. I\u2019ve never had clothes dry for five minutes and come out even somewhat damp. My clothes were soaked. Even after I had continuously reset the five minute timer over a span of 45 minutes, my clothes were still wet. I\u2019m really hoping that my return goes through otherwise I\u2019m out $270. Another thing I\u2019ll mention is that The plug is extremely short and I needed to use an extension cord in order to have it sit in my bathtub while it was doing its thing. One last thing, mine came damaged at the back but thankfully it didn\u2019t affect the washer. it also leaks if you try to move it at all while there is still water in the washer. I highly suggest looking for a different washer/dryer of this kind unless you live somewhere where you can hang dry your clothes.",
