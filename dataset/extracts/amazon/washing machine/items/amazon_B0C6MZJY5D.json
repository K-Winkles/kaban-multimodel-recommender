There's no rinse cycle on its own, but that's workable.The spin cycle isn't going to be as thorough as a regular washer but it'll spin out some of the excess liquid.I'm really pleased with this little machine.",

When I plugged it in to use it wouldn\u2019t make connection to turn on. There was either a short in the electrical wiring, or the plug terminal was spread so it wouldn\u2019t make contact. If you wiggled the wire and hit it just right it would turn on but then you had to hold ot on place to finish cycling. So disappointed and returned.",
