                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got this portable wash machine to just wash small items like tea towels, dishcloths, socks, and underwear. It washes the items well. As for the spinner, it only spins for 2 mins and if you want it to spin longer you have to keep turning it back on the seetin which is called drain. The spinner bowl snaps in securely. It doesn't spin all the items at once very well. I just did one or two items at a time. If they are heavy items like wool socks or tea towels you might have to still wring them out by hand. That isn't a big deal for me. For the price, I feel it's worth it.",

We\u2019ve also had multiple issues with our plumbing as our house is older and so we\u2019ve gone through a few brief periods where we couldn\u2019t use our washing machine until plumbers had a chance to work on our old drains, and I thought this would have been so helpful to have during those times. Of course it hasn\u2019t happened since, so I\u2019m hoping just having this is a good luck charm that means we wont have anymore issues lol",

                "reviewText": "I got this just to see if it really worked. I washed a few items and added minimum liquid laundry detergent. It washed just fine, rinsing out the soap I did twice, just to make sure it was all out. The spin cycle moves the whole machine, even with the suction cups pushed down. I was thinking this may be an alternative to hand washing. It could be. But for use inside the house, I found that the drain pipe really needs to be longer, also should be a bit closer to the bottom, to drain all the liquid you must tilt the machine towards the drain.If I was camping and had access to running water, and electricity this would be nice to have around. A good way to wash small items like socks if you get your feet all wet.I think they feel that the \"blue ray light\" ultraviolet light that sterilizes bacteria will make the clothes clean. It might, but I still want to use a little soap. So you have to have it close to a drain, running water, and electricity. I would not use it for anything too heavy, unless you have a line that you can drip dry it on. It could wash it, but not really spin dry it at all. The basket is too small to do anything other than t-shirts, underwear, socks, and such.At this price point, if you camp in places that have water and electricity, it could be very handy, however it is a bit high for the amount of how it is presently.",
