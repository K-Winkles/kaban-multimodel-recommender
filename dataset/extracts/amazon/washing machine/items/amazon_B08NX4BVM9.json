This machine does a great job at cleaning and getting the water out of the clothes on the spin cycle. If you\u2019re on the fence about this machine\u2026it\u2019s worth the money even if you\u2019re doing smaller loads. I did have to hook this up at the kitchen sink versus the tub or bathroom sink because I have a small bathroom but it has wonderful. Small enough to move with ease but big enough to wash multiple big towels and even sheets and blankets. Don\u2019t count this washer out!",

                "reviewText": "No more sorting, bagging, loading into the trunk to drive, walk or catch a bus to a secondary location ( laundromat, friend\u2019s house ), unload the bags of laundry, sit, wait, wash, dry, then have to re-bag, re-load into trunk, drive, walk, catch a bus back home to AGAIN unload, un-bag, to iron, fold, and/or hang, nd put away.Oh my Goodness!! The freedom of doing your laundry in your own space using your own machines is a TREMENDOUS BLESSING!!I live in a 1BR, 1BA apartment with no hookups. This compact washer fits perfectly in my small kitchen with the drain hose in the kitchen sink.Moving it into place was a bit of a workout but it has wheels on the bottom, In The Back Only and not he front, and inverted handles on the side which made it a little easier. And it doesn\u2019t roll well on my low pile, Berber carpet, so, I found it easier to \u201cwalk\u201d it.I stood behind the machine, tilting it back toward me onto it\u2019s wheels, and just kinda walked it into position.It IS a bit noisy but not so much that it bothers me or my neighbors. To me, it\u2019s no more noisy than a full size washer.DO NOT make the mistake I made and simply sit the drain hose inside a bucket because the hose was too short to reach the sink, thinking that A BUCKET\ud83e\udd28 will be enough to hold all the water as it drains at the end of the cycle. DUH!!Fortunately, I ran the suggested Test Run and sat nearby monitoring. I was able to catch the over pour and remedy the situation preventing a flooding problem. For the time being, I have to scoot the washer closer to the sink every time I do a wash, so that the drain hose reaches.Ive, ordered an extension hose to so that I won\u2019t have to much longer.Great washer. Works great. Instructions were easy to follow. In excellent condition.JUST ONE ISSUE: it came without the bottom cover. It was supposed to be packaged in the box along with the machine itself and the hoses but it was not. So, if you tilt it back and look underneath the machine you can see all of it\u2019s guts & parts.I was concerned that this might be an issue but upon Googling it, learned that back in the day ALL washers came without a bottom cover, with their guts exposed.I\u2019ve washed 3 loads, so far, with this not being an issue. No drips, no leaks, nothing.Plus I ordered a drain pan that I have it sitting in that gives me a level of security.One of the best purchases I\u2019ve made, so far. No regrets.",

                "reviewText": "First off, if you're planning on being sneaky with adding a portable machine to your apartment - your neighbors absolutely will hear this one! Both down stairs and next door neighbors will know, because the spin cycle sounds like a freight train. I did level it with a tool, and I got a thick rubber shop mat to put under it. You can still hear the machine from two rooms away with all doors closed once it goes into the spin cycle.As for the job it does, I have no complaints there. Only the quick 15 minute setting (which washes for 3 minutes) doesn't wash adequately. All other settings are great. It washes like any standard full size machine. If I'd known that it was this good, I'd have gotten one years ago.I have the 2.0 size and the amount of clothes it washes is about 10-15 adult pieces, depending on what type of clothes. Obviously that you can fit more tank tops than sweatshirts. If I wash a mixed load of leggings, tank tops, and womens t-shirts I do about 15 pieces.To give an easy to eyeball quantity - the short plastic laundry baskets that are about 1.5 bushel size (the 24\" x 17\" x 10\" baskets)... you can fit 3/4 of that basket for a large load in this machine. When my basket is 3/4 full, it's time to wash. This washer is about half the size of a standard household machine.It doesn't have a center agitator, so pants and long sleeve tops tangle. I have to open the lid before spin cycles and untangle the spaghetti monster or it gets unbalanced and even louder with banging around. It's an added chore, but not a big deal because there is a pause button.If you have a faucet which is like a hose that pulls out, you shouldn't connect the machine to it. The adapter may fit, but I found info elsewhere (not provided by manufacturer) that says fluctuating pressure from machine use can burst that hose. I had to instead use it at another sink which is in a less ideal location, but it's not a big deal. I'm just happy that I found that info before a plumbing emergency happened!I see that some reviewers are confused about blue drum vs no blue drum. The 2.0 size has an all gray drum. Some of the other sizes have blue colored bottom inside, but not the 2.0!Delivery was great in the sense that they scheduled and arrived in time. The delivery guys were nice, and they brought the machine upstairs for me. The box was not damaged. But the machine inside had some dents to the metal body in places. It doesn't seem to have affected function, but it's unsightly from one side.I would recommend to put it on a dolly, even if you won't be moving it. If you ever have a splash or a leak, or to clean the filter in the back, you'll want better wheels. The wheels that come on it are bare minimum function and basically only useful to get it place, not to move it around. The 2.0 size is 80 lbs when empty, so not a dainty thing.Speaking of splashes! The reason you should use HE detergent is because regular detergent foams too much and then some of the excess foam leaks from the bottom. Just water doesn't leak, and detergent that doesn't foam like crazy doesn't leak.One thing I wish for is a more customizable custom cycle. I want a longer wash time combined with the shortest 3 minute spin cycle (because my neighbors have complained about the noise of this machine) but I can't make that combo. Only the lousy quick wash cycle has a 3 minute spin... all others are 7 or 12 minute spin.I'm deducting one star for the noise level of the spin cycle. Other than that, I'm happy with the machine!",
