It\u2019s also easy to store until you\u2019re ready to let your washing machine air out once more. Improve Long-Term Clothing Quality By eliminating odors in the machine after washing your clothes you can worry less about those odors transferring to your clothes. This is especially important if you\u2019ve got hard water or other impurities that can impact water quality or smell. Surface Safe Adhesion Our door prop uses a strong suction cup or hook on one end and an equally strong magnet on the other which helps hold it in place without screwing or mounting either side. Minimalist Design The small, white or black cable fits perfectly with a wide range of popular brands and doesn\u2019t detract from the overall look or style, so you don\u2019t have to worry about a gaudy mess.",

It holds my washer door open for as long as I need and allows the washer to completely dry out. Since it a string magnet, when not in use, I attach it to the side of the washer. The magnet is so powerful it stays attached during the spin cycle! I would highly recommend this to anyone that has a front loading washing machine.",

You have to walk by it to get to the laundry room sink and my husband would push the door closed when he'd walk by. The washing machine door isn't metal on the inside so I needed one that would hook or suction to it. This was it and at a great price. I use the hook through the latch and it works perfectly. Easy to remove when I need to do laundry and since it has a strong magnet, you can stick it anywhere metal until you're done with the washing machine. It's exactly what I needed.",

We really needed this because our washer is in a narrow laundry room right by the doorway, so having the door open all the way blocked the doorway. So we would have to suck it in, just to get by. This holds the washer door open just enough that we can walk past without having to suck it in, and also gets enough air flow to dry the seal between loads.The magnet attaching it to the machine is very strong, and you have a choice of a metal hook or a suction cup to attach to the door. It's well made and durable, and very flexible, whether you want to prop your door just an inch, 6\", or even more.",

                "reviewText": "As most owners of front loaders know, if you don\u2019t dry out the inside of the washer every time and let it air out until the next wash, it smells funny. This is the perfect way to leave your door open just enough to air it out and yet not have it swing in the way. My son had one and I loved it so he bought one for me. A friend came by and saw mine and immediately bought one for herself. We are all very happy with this inexpensive hack!",

For me, I spin it down when the washer is running and to swap loads then spin it up and have the suction cup stick to the glass. This keeps the door open enough to avoid mold and also keeps the door from swinging all the way open and being an obstacle in the laundry room.",
