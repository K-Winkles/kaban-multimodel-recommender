It doesn't really have a lot of power and I could really only wash a shirt and a couple socks, in order for it to spin, and actually wash the things. absolutely would not be able to handle a pair of pants. and the spin cycle is a freaking joke. your damp clothes just sit on top of a barely rotating mechanism, and I ended up having to wring them out in the bathtub.

If it worked it would be a great product to have traveling or in a small area.The instructions are not very good and do not explain how to work it. I tried multiple times but got the same result. There is a drain for easy draining of the water. It is a reasonably priced product and seems to be made with good quality material. I was not able to get it to work so it is not worth the price.",
