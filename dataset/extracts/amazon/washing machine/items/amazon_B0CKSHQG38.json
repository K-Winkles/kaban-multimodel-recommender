This is absolutely perfect for that. It sits nicely on the counter and the agitator spins and stops which allows you to move the item around if you need to. The clothes come out clean and smell great. It's easy to fill up and easy to empty. It's lightweight so they don't have any issues moving it around and folding it and keeping it out of sight when not being used. Absolutely love this!",
