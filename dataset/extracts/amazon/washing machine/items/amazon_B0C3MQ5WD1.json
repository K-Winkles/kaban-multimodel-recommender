Another option is to utilize a laundry service or communal laundry room in your building or neighborhood. Hand Wash for Intimate Clothing: Hand washing is a gentle way to clean delicate clothing items such as lingerie. Fill a container with lukewarm water and a small amount of gentle detergent, then gently agitate and rinse the garment until it's clean. Hang or lay it flat to dry. Dirty Communal Washing Machine: Wash the washing machine first with hot water and detergent, then run a cycle with vinegar or another cleaning agent to disinfect the machine. Try to coordinate with other residents to schedule cleaning times or consider investing in a personal laundry machine. No Washing Machine in Small Amount: Pick up a few basics, such as a clothesline, detergent, and a basin or bucket, and handwash your clothes when needed. You can also visit a laundromat or utilize a laundry service. Don't Want to Wash on Business Trip: Choose clothing items that can be worn more than once or consider packing disposable clothing items. Utilize a laundry service or drop off your clothing at a nearby laundromat. Clothes Can't Be Machine Washed: Hand wash your clothing items or consider sending them to a professional dry cleaner. Always check labels and care instructions before cleaning any garment.",
