                "reviewText": "I bought this to make my vacations a little easier. When we go, we are gone for 10 or more days. I usually end up washing socks, etc, in the sink or tub, then twist squeeze the items in a towel to get the bulk of the water out and hang to dry in the shower. I tested it on face masks from covid. It's not hard to open. I didn't hook it up to the faucet, just put it in my walk in shower. I could only put in about four masks, so if the item you put in is too big, you may have to put less in the machine. This is mostly determined by how much you can put in the spin basket. The only problem I have is that there is no way to put the basket in the machine for storage, even thought the basket collapses. If you take it on vacation, you have to be careful how you pack it. Otherwise, I have hopes that I won't have to do the personal items by hand in a sink that doesn't have a stopper. Will update the review after my next trip, which isn't until May.",

                "reviewText": "This foldable washer is more bulky but big enough to hold 1 to 2 pcs depends on what you wash; the machine didn't come with the T-connector, we had been ONLY using the manual mode: pouring water by ourselves but it drained automatically; definitely missing its main feature: auto washing modes.The user manual only mentioned a T-connector should be use and soon as realizing no T-connector, we contacted Swiss Global the seller. It usually took 1-2 days to receive a reply; after emphasizing we only had 2.5 weeks to Amazon's A-Z protection deadline, it said the missing part would be mailed from China (taking about 2 weeks) and it would be relayed to us soon as arriving in USA. However the seller made it difficult and stressful for us to receive the missing part: despite Swiss Global received it on Thursday, it was waited until the following Monday afternoon to mail it out claiming Post Office wouldn't open during weekend but it was opened on Saturday. Thus we only received the part a day before the Amazon protection expired, we did not have enough time to try the auto-wash-auto-drain feature. Returning the machine because of: Dry basket fell off mostly of the time during the Spin Dry cycle, Quick Water Inlet can't be taken out after plug in so difficult to pack for travelling, and very poor post-purchase service (while still under Amazon's protection; if without this, who know if Swiss Global would be care enough to reply).",

I told one of my relatives about it and he requested me to order one for him since he don\u2019t have prime. Today I went to help him set-up. We decided to do test run. After one cycle was over it started pulling water again but as it pull water it started draining immediately. I thought water might stop draining after sometime but it keep draining. Restarted, unplugged, water pressure brought down, did several other try but nothing could fix. Supper frustrated and kinda embarrassed . My relatives might be thinking that it might not be good product. I reordered another one for him. I\u2019m kind worried this time. Hope they send me good and working unit.",
