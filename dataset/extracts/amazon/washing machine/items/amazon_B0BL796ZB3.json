We usually process mail and in-mail messages within 24 hours. The protection bracket in the washing machine is damaged. What should I do? The protection bracket in the washing machine does not affect the use of the washing machine. You can tear it down. Its function is to protect the internal parts of the washing machine during transportation. I chose to AA soak, but the washing machine didn't work. What should I do? If immersion is selected, the washing machine will not start working properly until the clothes have been soaked for 15 minutes. Can the washing machine wash clothes in hot water? The washing machine can wash clothes in hot water. But pay attention to the fabric. Some materials will deform and fade if washed in hot water, which will also reduce the effect of laundry detergent. There is abnormal noise in the washing machine. How should I handle it? Please note: If the clothes are not evenly placed, the inner clothes cannot be dried during the drying process and there will be abnormal sound of clothes hitting the washing machine barrel.",

The only set i could find was $950 per piece. THEN i found this Krib Bling Full-Automatic Washing Machine with LED Display, 17.7 lbs Portable Compact Washer. Just did the first 2 loads. AMAZING!! They fully test the units for leaks and operation as part of the manufacturing process .. [i'd bought another style before this one and it leaked like a sieve] THIS WASHER IS GREAT... Very quiet, Large metal drum, agitator moves the clothes around well, fit 5 bath towels in the first load... they spun super dry... uses HE liquid or powder detergent. I highly recommend this washer. This unit + a compact dryer only cost me $500 total. Including electrician costs, a larger washer & dryer set would have been close to $3000. But I'm good!!! This is totally a keeper.",

To combat this, I decided to invest in a washing machine and this one made by Krib Bling was the winner for me. It's pretty compact, meaning I can place this inside my living room and not have it take too much space which is huge for anyone living in a small footprint. It can wash a huge load at a time, I read around 17 pounds which is insane! Lastly, unlike the ones in the laundromat, this one purrs like a kitten and is super quiet! Definitely worth the investment for any small household.",

I tried cleaning it off which pretty much worked. Decided to try it out. Not only did it leak from the connectors it leaked out from the machine itself all over the floor. The pump does not work well and now the machine still has water in it. Returning asap. After writing the review I spoke with amazon who said I would receive a refund no need to return because of the water in the machine and my fear of it leaking in my car. After waiting the 7-10 days still no refund and they are saying I need to return. I luckily kept the machine because I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t throw it out before receiving the return. I believe this company will again sell this defective item. Customer Beware! And I\u2019m disappointed in amazons customer service as well.",

                "reviewText": "While I'm generally a careful buyer, thinking things out and researching products first, I still wound up buying several portable / compact clothes washers before getting here; maybe I can help you avoid doing the same. Portable/compact washers come in a variety of configurations and features; some options/choices are pretty up-front and obvious- but some are not. Planning to use mine at work and in my small camping trailer I was mainly focused on compact size, low water & power usage, a strong spin-dry, and of course doing a good job of cleaning. This first led to purchase of a machine with a separate spin/wash tub with emphasis on it's having 2 motors and a drain pump vs. gravity drain. #1- If it's a 2-tub machine it's semi-automatic and likely no water valve control. #2- Including a drain pump is better than none, but even the best of them is more of an \"assist\"- not very aggressive. Time moving loads between tubs was not an issue- manual water control for wash, then rinse, then during spin was. Moving into a single tub, full automatic was a much better choice for me. Auto valve-controlled water input more like a traditional full-size machine is a real plus, as is the digital control with multiple wash setting options. While I was left a bit skeptical at first about purchase of a unit with a name like \"Krib Bling\", I shouldn't have been; this machine has performed extremely well right from the start. No leaks, no function errors, no problems with operation at all. Even better- the Krib Bling machine is very pleasantly quiet running in all phases of operation. For myself, there's only 2 areas of shortcoming from being ideal; one probably resolved in future models, with the other no doubt improved: 1. Addition of an intermittent water spray during the spin cycle would be nice; maybe not included here due potential of unbalancing operation, and haven't found this included with any other portable machines, either. 2. While just 38 lb. it's a little cumbersome to move around frequently. Placement and size of the hand grip areas could improve the portability, but they're certainly not a downfall as is. Overall, the 17.7 lb capacity Krib Bling Fully Automatic Portable Washer has proven to be the right choice for my needs, and has surpassed all other portables I have found!",

At first the washer wasn't making any noise, but after a few washes it got so loud and it started to smell like something electric was burning. I do like that it's big to put a few things, but don't overfill. It does have a few settings for different types of clothing. After a few months of owning this machine, my clothing is starting to make small tear marks, wish I could return to be honest",

Simple to use, you just have to connect the cable with your sink and it has many different modes for many types of cleaning options and although it doesn\u2019t look so big which makes it very compact. I keep it in my room\u2019s wardrobe and I just connect to my bathroom when I need to use - I separately bought a suitable carrying car that I only move it with it so I don\u2019t have to drag it every time as it is a bit heavy but is perfect if you don\u2019t have the space or can\u2019t for some reason have an usual laundry machine. In fact, even if you do is an interesting option because of it portability and large capacity of laundry space. Also, it is a very silent and stable machine, so when it starts to spin fast to dry it manage to stay very firm which is another pro point. I so far never had any problem and 100% recommend.",
