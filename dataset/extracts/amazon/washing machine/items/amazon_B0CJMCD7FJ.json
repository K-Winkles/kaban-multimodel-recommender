Although it seems sturdy, the cord goes directly into the unit, and there are no specifics on how to safely use it. Is it going to be the same thing as electrocuting someone by dropping a toaster into a bathtub like in old movies? I think the cord is supposed to come out the top. The instructions also said something about turning it off, but it did not seem like there was a way to do that other than simply unplugging, so I was confused. It does not have a UL listed indicator.",

But yes, it will get them clean.Then rinse the excess soap off in a sink, wring them out and dry them. Done!This particular washing machine will stop running after about 15 minutes so you'll have to re-plug it to run more.",

                "reviewText": "So first off, don't let the definite article fool you. This is just the white agitator device. All that talk about 'the bucket' makes you think it comes with a bucket. It does not. Just make sure you know that!I used it in the manner in which I would be using it--travel. I brought it on a recent trip and it was handy. If you use it in the bathroom sink, you want to set it vertically (as shown) and that might give you one place to put it--on the very back of the sink. And you might not be able to fill up the sink to cover the whole thing because bathroom sinks in hotels are now tiny for some reason?Anyway, I used it for two pairs of undies and two pairs of socks, and used shampoo instead of laundry detergent, because, like I said, realistic travel scenario, I'm not going to bring a bag of strange white powder in my luggage, if you know what I mean. I did that in the 1990s and...never again.It was a bit splashy (I had to dry down the counter with a towel) but it worked surprisingly well. The water got dirty looking and my socks and undies once they dried smelled clean and fresh after air drying over the shower curtain.This will not replace my home laundry machine, and honestly until or unless I travel with a bucket, it's got a small capacity--maybe a tee shirt's worth, because of the sink capacity. I also don't know how I'd trust it with significant stains like oil or chocolate (but that's more on the pretreatment than anything else). But if you're just trying to freshen up your unmentionables, or you forgot a spare pair of socks, this is great.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1. It's portable.2. It spins well for an item of its size.3. The suction for attachment is really strong.4. Set it and forget it washing.Cons:1. Mainly useful for light-weight clothing.2. Only about 3 articles of regular weight clothing will spin well.3. Must be used in a taller bucket/sink otherwise water will splatter.Although there are more pros than cons, it is those cons that made this washer a deal breaker for me. My first attempt was to wash two, regular weight socks, and one light weight pair of underwear. I thought the cleaning was doing well, so then I added another pair of cotton underwear to the mix. Once added, the clothing became congested and stuck. I kept fixing this and finally decided to leave the wash cycle alone to see if it would regulate itself. It did, but took some time.Ultimately, the clothing didn't come out the cleanest, even after two complete wash cycles. In theory the idea of this item is nice, but the follow through wasn't all I thought it would be.",

Maybe for a small item it will work in the sink. I tried it for a couple of work tee shirts. The items kept gavitating to the washer and getting stuck on it causing the motor to stop. It did restart automatically once the item was removed off of it, but it got kinda annoying. The washer is powerful but a little loud. Im going to try it in a 5 gallon bucket and a collapsible dish pan when using to wash more items together and hope for a better outcome.",
