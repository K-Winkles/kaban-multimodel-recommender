                "reviewText": "I bought the largest size portable washer I could find as my niece was constantly coming to our house to do her laundry. In her dorm there isn\u2019t a lot of laundry room options so I bought this to limit her always having to come to our house for clean clothes. The 32 lb washer is a nice size for a standard load of laundry. She can wash her sheets in there also but I don\u2019t think I would attempt to wash a thick comforter in there as it might be too big.The washer is quick and the spin cycle works phenomenal to not leave the clothes soaking wet after being washed, and then she can hang them to dry- I didn\u2019t realize when I bought this that it would come with a free drying rack so that was a bonus!I would think this would also be a great investment for people that travel in their RV often.I had seen other reviews said their drain hose had issues but I felt the washer I purchased has a good seal and had no complaints with the length of the hose.",

I tried just using it for underwear, t-shirts, dish towels and socks. But I would have to run it everyday if not several times a day. The having to fill the wash water and drain it and then refill for rinse. In the end I'm still taking everything to the laundromat",

Was surprised by how good the agitator was . Spinner side holds less so sometimes had to divide my wash loads in half to get them spun dry. Personally, I would have liked the hoses to be longer and the power cord for my situation with set up but was able to adapt. Was pleasantly surprised with how dry the clothes were and didn't need to have them hung up very long to complete.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the 18lbs model as it was the only available to me here in Hawaii- at double the normal price even. We needed a larger capacity but non to be sold here. We are a family of 4 and I have washed 4 loads thus far on my 1st day of use.This can effectively wash and spin a load size that fits a 7.5 L bucket (1.98 gal) for reference. I do pack it down so maybe 8 L which does slow down the pulsating action some on the wash. The manual does state not to use water temperature above 60\u00b0C. I do 2 cycles of wash per load (1 detergent, 1 rinse with vinegar) then load all into the spinner and add more water there. There were no issues with my powder detergent and added boosters like oxyclean not dissolving with cold water like in my normal sized front loader he kenmore. It does spin the clothes dry very well as others have stated. The only time I've felt an off balance load was when it was not packed full.It was able to wash 4 oversized microfiber bath towels in one load and all were able to fit into the spinner at once with no issues.You definitely will need lint traps as there's no filter listed in the manual nor could I see any. I used a stocking but there were still a lot of lint in my bath tub.Not sure how to install the hanger as there were no instructions for it.There's definitely a burning plastic smell when operating but we don't see any smoke or issues with the plug.Some suggestions to make a twin tub machine better running. Purchase a water line hose with a quick connect adapter to connect to your shower head or faucet with an additional diverter so you can fill either side with ease. There's also an adapter sold here to fit to your tub filler as well. You could even use the rinsearoo that is a silicone piece which goes over your water spout. If you don't wanna really do some plumbing but want a water source attached. Do purchase a extension drain hose as it's very short if you don't plan to leave it in your shower or have a low lying drain to route the draining water. A stand or maybe a appliance cart to move around.",

The place where I live has public washer and dryer. But for hygiene, I would like to washing most of my small items by myself. This washing machine frees my hand. I can put it in the bathroom, put the water in it, and place all my clothes in it. Then I just need to select the timer, and let it work.The spin drying is very helpful and powerful. After spinning, most of the clothes will be dry enough, so they don't need dryer any more. Just use the drying rack, hang them up and wait for them to dry.It saves my time. Also, it's very affordable. Very recommended if you don't have a washer and dryer in your unit.",
