                "reviewText": "Once out of the box, I noticed the water intake hose doesn\u2019t fit any faucet or shower hose in my apartment, you think the intake hose would be up to date with sizes \ud83d\ude44, but you have to spend more money on parts just for this to work as it should, instead you have to manually fill it with water. The power cord is waaaay to short, the only way I can fill it with water is with the shower head, but the outlet isn\u2019t anywhere near the shower (safety reasons duh). Drain hose also sucks, it doesn\u2019t actually pump out all the water, because I cannot just set this inside my tub like originally planned (because outlet is so far from the tub) so there\u2019s always water in the bottom that never pumps out all the way, and I can\u2019t leave the doors open because it has this smell as soon as I got it (like a new plastic smell but my husband doesn\u2019t like it) if you have thick absorbing towels they will take longer to dry. I also have to stand there the whole time with the machine because I have to add water manually to the spinner to get the damn soap out. The size isn\u2019t very good for a small apartment, and being 8months prego it\u2019s not easy to move at all! Overall this isn\u2019t the product I was hoping for, it gets my clothes cleaned so that\u2019s why it got 3 star, cause I don\u2019t wanna pay to do laundry where everyone else does \ud83e\udd22.",
