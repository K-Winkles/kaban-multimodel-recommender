                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Tired of spending crazy money at the laundromat while at the family cabin for 6 months/year, or filling up my car with dirty laundry when I have to go home periodically, I decided to try out this portable washer/spinner. So glad I did!! In the few weeks I've been using it, it has paid for itself. Honestly I like it better than my big machine at home. It's fun and easy to use, gets my clothes cleaner and fresher smelling in a much shorter time, uses less water/energy/soap as well. I have elderly dogs and use \"dog towels\" which need frequent washing. I can bring less clothing to the cabin as I can run a small load anytime. I purchased a drying rack from Amazon a few years ago. I set it up on a sunny deck and after spinning (w/no wrinkles like in my big machine at home) items dry in about an hour. I use my new washer in an old tub (see pic). A small hose attached to tub faucet fills, and it drains into tub drain w/attached drain hose, works perfectly. I didn't need to raise up the machine (which is nearly impossible anyway) and yes a little water gets under machine when draining, but it is definitely not an issue. I love this little machine. It saves hours and many dollars at the laundromat. I have a few tips: dont use too much soap, use liquid as the pods are gonna be too much soap for any load that fits, ,and while you can rinse on the wash side after washing and draining, just filling up again w/fresh water, I have found that using minimal soap, sufficient water and not too many items per load, AND adding a little liquid water softener right in w/the soap during the wash cycle, cleans and softens without the need of rinsing at all..as long as items aren't excessively dirty. If you are careful with the lint holder, empty after each load, let it dry and carefully snap it back in, it will last and function well. I leave the tops open to dry machine after using. Press the vented plastic piece onto the wet clothes on spinner side and it takes about a minute to spin water out. I recommend not overloading either side. It's just me and my dogs. This is not designed for use by a large family, maybe just as a backup. All said, it's an amazing little machine and I believe I chose the best one at the best price!",

                "reviewText": "Ive been on the fence about getting this washer for about a year now. I waited because prices were so high because of demand I guess. I finally bought it. Anyway, its worth it so far! I did a lot of loads already because we were kind of backed up. This works perfect for two people. We go to the gym so its quick to just do loads and it practically spins our clothes dry. I just hope it last I have not been overfilling with clothes and making sure when I spin its not uneven to cause shaking. If this last me at least a 10months to a year ill be happy with my purchase. Also, it comes in regular box can't really tell what it is unless you go up to it and read it so if you're worried to get it delivered. And if you forget to move the spinner knob after draining it will cause it to leak out but it doesn't matter for me because I put it in the tub. I did that a few times so I thought it might have a leak. I tested again to be sure I didnt refill while still turned on drain and it didn't leak. I am still satisfied.UPDATE: 6/29/23I put a yoga mat down in the shower folded to fit the washer to try to block out the sound for the other apartment i'm on the second floor.I don't use the attachments I just bought a handheld shower head and I can fill up like that.I am able to wash two standard size towels at a time. 1 king sheet at a time with two pillow cases.I only spin 1 towel at a time. I spin the 1 sheet at a time.I wash a very small hamper at dollar tree loads at a time. After I use I shake any water out and wipe inside with a towel and dry and water and keep the lids open to completely dry I don't want moldy smelling clothes.update: 8/23/23its still going strong and getting my clothes clean :)",

                "reviewText": "I placed two bath towels in to try the product out and it worked well with washing. Then I placed those two towels in the spinner and I could smell a faint wiff of burning plastic. I thought the smell was possibly \"a first use smell.\" It took me about 10 minutes to start my second load. Again a small load of socks and underwear. At this time, I turned on the normal cycle to wash and nothing. The machine just made a clicking sound. I really wanted this product to work but I guess you get what you pay for. I'm going to send it back for a full refund. I don't even want to try another.",

I am giving 4 stars because the cord is very short the drain hose and the inlet hose are both flimsy and the inlet hose does not fit on any taps in my home. The agitator in the machine sounds normal when it agitates to the right but makes a very loud noise when it agitates to the left which of concerning and I am not sure if that is normal??? I am using the machine in my bathtub so I don't have to worry about the drain hose coming out of a bucket on to the floor. I am using a bucket to fill the machine since the inlet hose is not useable. Over all a great machine for the price.",

                "reviewText": "First off, the machine arrived way before the estimated time of arrival. It arrived three (3) days after I ordered it... that was a nice surprise.It washes as good as a bigger machine, and the spin-dry describes spin-dry very well, it comes out from the spin almost dry for small items.The only drawback are the hoses. The water inlet hose does not fit any of my tap fixtures. So I use a bucket to fill it. I put the machine in the bathtub (like others have done), then the drain hose works very well this way. As for the water inlet hose, I have ordered a new shower-head which has a long hose that will reach the machine wery well, to fill it up, rather than using a bucket.I consider these drawbacks not too harsh given that the machine is awsome!",
