                "reviewText": "I have have a Smad refrigerator for five years now and it has served me well. So I trust this washer will do the same.Packaging is intelligent and secure. It is heavier than most (a good sign I think) but if you are receiving and placing it yourself as I diid, be aware of its weight. Construction is impressive and fit and finish is excellent. The instruction booklet is much better than most Chinese products. It covers every detail in clear english.The first stopper I encountered was it would not come alive plugged into a 15 amp GFI outlet, so I installed a new 20 amp one. Still nothing. A check in manual says plug it into a standard 120 volt grounded outlet. Did so and it liked that.I intended to use the unit with cold water only (the latest thing out there to save energy heating the water and claims your clothes last longer that way). The unit has a cold water only setting, but that one will not allow the Heavy Duty settings. So I ran a load on Heavy Duty and it ran all of the cycles. without any hot water connected. I don't know if it used less total water that way, but the results appeared OK. Time will tell.Now the only not so good. I have run three loads so far and all had extreme out-of-balance shaking. All of the feet are in equal contact with wooden platform it is on. The manual says open the door and rearrange the clothes. That works but is an added something to attend to. Again time will tell and I will update.Update- The Amazon product description says the door hinge is on the right side-its on the left. Important if you are matching it to a dryer.",
