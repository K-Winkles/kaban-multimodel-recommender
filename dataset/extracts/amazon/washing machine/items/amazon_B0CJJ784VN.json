                "reviewText": "I thought this might be a good alternative to washing compression wraps in my sink. I never have enough for a full load, and need a clean set before I would do my normal laundry routine. I'm not sure if this was a better alternative or not. To start, there are no English instructions. That isn't a huge deal. To turn the machine on, you seem to hold your finger on the pad rather than actually press anything. There doesn't seem to be an actual, moving button. You've got 3, 5, and 10 minute cycles. At least, that's what I assume the numbers mean. The control labels aren't in English either. All you have is a black pad and the numbers. I'm not sure what the little basket is for. I only loosely clips onto the spinning part at the bottom of the machine, so it instantly comes loose in both water and air. Really no idea on that one. Also, the hose doesn't make sense to me. It seems to only be useful when drying items, but the basket doesn't work so the drying function doesn't work so the hose seems pointless. As you may be able to tell I'm talking myself into disliking this thing more and more as I type this.If there's one positive, it's that the spin motion actually spins the water well. The itty-bitty ridges at the bottom actually move the full tank. Wow. I really wouldn't have thought it could do that so well in the few seconds the motor actually runs before pausing and, I assume, switching directions. Pretty neat.Overall, I've talked myself out of recommending this thing. Half the functionality simply doesn't exist. It does not dry. You'll also have to lift and move it around to drain it no matter what so the hose is useless without the drying function. Maybe someone with a lot of delicates will find more of a use for this thing.",

                "reviewText": "I like the smaller size and that it folds down after use for storage. It's useful for washing smaller items in-between larger loads in a washer. I can see it being useful when camping, at a hotel/traveling, and for people living in apartments. However, it does have its limits so make sure understand what they are before using it. Nothing heavy, like jeans, larger clothes, or heavy towels, only smaller ones.I'm using this for special cleaning cloths & dishtowels I have to keep them lint-free, along with cleaning my winter fuzzy socks separately. That's of value to me.Upon setting this up I noticed that the instruction sheet was totally written in an asian language, not english, so I referred to the pictures on it instead. That was okay for assembly, but this company is lacking usage instructions even on their listing site. This is why I deducted one star.I ended up watching other seller videos for the same type unit to understand 'how to effectively' use this one. However, even those sellers don't ever mention rinsing the clothes washed. What on earth? They simply wash, drain the water out, & spin the items dry. So now you have soap in your clothes. It seems they all need to hire someone to better relate this product, including full written instructions, to their buyers. Thus, another star deducted. The buyer shouldn't ever have to do the footwork to figure out how to use the sellers product. Its fairly easy to use this unit, but time consuming if you plan on rinsing your items washed. While I think this mini-washing machine has some merit, no way is it worth the listed price to me.",
