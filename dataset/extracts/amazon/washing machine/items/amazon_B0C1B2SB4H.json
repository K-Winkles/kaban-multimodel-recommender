                "reviewText": "This little washer is amazing.It cleans better than traditional washers!Even though, it requires more effort, hands down, perfect for small spaces.I have been a mini salon owner for 7 years. I have transported my shop laundry ever since, until now.I have washed 3 loads so far.If the spin is too hard after about 30 seconds, reposition your spin.The spin cycle.If you wash a full load, you may have to separate and spin.For me. 1 wash equals 3 separate spins per load.Again, this is salon towels x2 loads and 1 load of capes.",

                "reviewText": "t55555I've tried a couple of these little washers, and I have to say that this one is a cut above the rest. It's easy to use, and it gets my clothes clean and fresh. The price is a bargain, in my opinion, and the washer seems to be well made and sturdy. It does small loads, but if I were traveling, I'd say this is the way to go. We went this route because we're remodeling and until I can get my big ones put in place. I'd say this washer would be ideal for travel, small apartments, dorms, etc, and the quality is very good.",

                "reviewText": "I live in an apartment in NYC with no washer or dyer. This product right here saves me a ton of money! Since washing clothes is $2+ for just a small load. So now about the washer, it is very easy to use! It doesn't hold a lot of clothes, but it still works. The only issue I had was with the hoses because it's very cheaply made and feels like I can break it, or it won't last too long. It washes the clothes very well and the spin rings out majority of the water out of the cloths. Less time it'll take to fully dry!! I definitely would recommend this product to anyone that lives in an apartment, RV, or just an emergency washer just in case your actual washer goes out.",
