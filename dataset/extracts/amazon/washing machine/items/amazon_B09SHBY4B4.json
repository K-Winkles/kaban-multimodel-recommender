Love this machineOk, I love this washing machine and it works perfectly in our motorhome. I've done 4 loads so far.....I was amazed at the dirt it extracted. So, my last load was me taking clean clothes I laundered at the laundry mat. I rewashed them and I'll be damed, the water turned a decently dark shade of brown. Now, I rinsed the washer out completely after each load, so it wasn't the washer that made that load look dirty. So, I'm impressed.Pros:-Lightweight and very easy to use.-Washes very well, I'd say better than most full sized machines.-The spin dryer is amazing. The clothes come out barely damp and try incredibly fast.-Large enough to do a good amount of clothing in one load.-Line dried clothes after washing are soft and wrinkle free. Just make sure you rinse well and you're good!Cons:-The power cord is really short.-The hoses are really short and not the best quality.Overall, I'd recommend this washing machine to anyone needing one for a small space.",

                "reviewText": "product of very low quality and not durable. It has a faulty drainage system. The materials with which the washing machine is made are of very low quality, the plastic is weak and not resistant, it does not have a filter system to filter impurities from the clothes, the hoses are made of a very weak material that can be broken with ease when handling them even with great care when using them. It only has two speeds to wash clothes 1. normal and 2. delicate, it does not have a faster speed. The centrifuge lid does not fit the centrifuge cylinder and the plastic is extremely hard and not flexible so it can hurt your hands and break easily. It has a defective pump to drain the water, and the washing machine is not capable of draining the water by gravity. It is not worth it despite being cheapPlease I Need My money back I am not satisfied at all with this purshased",

It was shipped beautifully and the set up could not have been easier! I use it several times a week with a family of 4 (plus animals). It gets our clothes clean EVERY TIME. Also super impressed with the spinner. It brings your clothes from sopping to slightly damp in seconds!! I would absolutely buy this again, it's a great product for the money you spend, and I tell all my friends and family that it's a great product! (They're quite sick of me talking about it, to be honest)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It gets clothes clean, works with all kinds of detergent, and the spinner is surprisingly effective. Clothes come out mostly dry, especially synthetic materials. Cotton takes a bit longer to dry, but if you can get a fan on \u2018em or some sun that\u2019ll speed things up. I just put the clean clothes on hangers to dry. I\u2019m usually not in a rush so waiting a few hours is no big deal.The only downside is the overall build quality seems ok-ish - who knows how long it will last. If I can get at least two years out of it I\u2019ll consider it money well spent.",

                "reviewText": "I recently went from Samsungs HE front loader(3 years old, 1500$ set) to a lesser version of this machine (100$) I was impressed with the lesser version and I just wanted something a little bigger to knock out the Laundromat all together. For a lone stranger laundromats can be intimidating,gross, weird, and creepy. Also I don't want another -HE- style behemoth. So, obviously I settled on this one (not 100$-certainly not 1500$)The pump, amazing feature not equipped on the smaller version.The Swirlydoo , powerfully smooth.The Basin, Huge (Queen sized bedding- obviously no oversized comforters)The Salad Spinner, like a jet turbine.Overall size and weight, manageable for even the lesser average Joe or Joie. I am just over five and a half feet tall, and fresh out of a surgery that immobilized my left arm. I had little trouble getting it in the house, out of the box, set up, and operating all lone wolf style. I love, love, love this eco alternative to pretty much every other version I've tried to get my water to run clear. This machine is a Sleeper. Compact with a big bite.",

If you're unsure, undecided about this purchase, JUST BUY IT! You will not regret it. Another thing you won't regret, carrying all that laundry back & forth. Also having the convenience at hand in case of DIRTY Emergencies. Keep in mind that comforters can't be washed in this. I am able to wash 1 set of King size sheets at once. Also light weight blankets are a breeze. Jeans, Towels, etc. are also easy. Only do a few pair at a time and if the towels are large a few at a time. Those items are very heavy when wet, so the agitator will not work well when weighted down.The one thing that would make this nicer is a DING noise once the cycle is done. Not a deal breaker, just a thought.I hope this was a helpful review.",
