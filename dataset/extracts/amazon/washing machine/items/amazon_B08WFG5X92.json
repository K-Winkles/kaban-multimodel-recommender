            "SMALL STATURE, BIG POWER - Using a powerful 250W motor, clothes are washed efficiently and fast using the detergent of your choice. Like larger household machines, the repetitive action of agitation and fast moving water combined with soap helps to remove dirt and stains, leaving you fresh laundry. With a transparent lid, you can watch it all happen. A Low Agitation Spin Cycle spin helps to dry your clothes without heat and helps to prevent stretching, tearing, or other damage to clothing items.",
            "ADJUSTABLE CONTROLS - Simple controls streamline an already fast process that doesn\u2019t take any longer than 15 minutes. Set your clothes to wash or go through a light agitation spin cycle from 3 to 15 minutes, depending on the clothes you are trying to wash. We recommend washing up to 4.4 lb of clothes (8.8 lb when wet). Ensure that you do not exceed this weight in clothing and to pack the spin cycle drum evenly.",
            "EASY CLEANUP - Emptying the washing machine is easy! Attached to each unit is a flexible drainage hose that can be extended or bent to hang over your bathtub or sink. Down the drain goes the dirty water, and you\u2019re left with clean fresh smelling laundry!",

            "DO NOT OVERFILL - This compact washer is intended to allow you to wash your clothes in spaces where a full-size machine won't fit, do not fill and treat this machine as a full-size washer. Follow the provided guidelines/weight limits and this washing machine will clean your clothes with ease!",
            "HOW MANY CLOTHES CAN I FIT IN THE WASHING MACHINE? - The max washing weight capacity is 4.4 lbs (8.8 lbs wet) and the max spin capacity is 4.4 lb. Before using a spin cycle to help dry your clothes, wring out your clothes to remove excess water. Use the following guidelines for determining the amounts of clothing to wash: 8 UNDERWEAR, 30 SOCKS, 4 BLUEJEANS, 5 T-SHIRTS."

This machine features a built-in mechanism to stop the motor from overheating. If you overload the washing machine during wash or spin cycles, you may trip this motor brake designed to stop the motor to prevent damage. Stay within in weight limits. How does the spin cycle work? This cycle does not use heat - instead, it relies on spinning a light agitating drum that helps to fling water from the articles of clothing. For best results, wring soaking wet clothes by hand and ensure they are equally distributed around the drum How many clothes can I dry at once? Ensure you do not overload the machine - never exceed 4.4 lbs of wet clothes. The machine will not spin if weight limit is exceeded to protect the motor. My clothes are still wet after using the spin dry cycle? Just like larger washing machines, spin cycles do not completely dry clothes. If you don't own a dryer, your clothes will still need to air dry after the cycle is complete. However, with less water in the clothing they'll dry faster!",

                "reviewText": "Is this going to replace your full sized washer? Absolutely not. Can you do a full sized load of laundry in here? No. Not even close. But, will it save you from trips to the laundry mat? Absolutely!You get what you pay for, and in my case I paid for a cheap, small washer to use after mine unexpectedly broke down. Doing laundry was more of a chore, and more time consuming after using this - But I had clean clothes, and didn't have to leave the house to do my laundry.It gets your clothes plenty clean, and is fairly simple to use: Keep it on a level surface, throw your clothes in, and fill it with water. Then set it to your preferred time, and you're good to let it do it's thing.The hardest part of the machine is it's spin function. The inner basket is much smaller than a typical load will be, and it is time consuming to transfer your laundry back and forth, spin it multiple times, and then finally put it up to dry (or put it in your dryer, if you have one). The spin cycle works plenty well and your clothes do get wrung out very decently, but it is a time consuming process.Overall, this light weight portable washing machine is perfect for emergencies. It is also ideal for camping, or vanlifers.",

                "reviewText": "I am disappointed with this product and I wish I could get my money back.After all the hype and expectations, I was excited to buy this deco home portable washing machine, but what a disappointment it is, at this point, I would have already be made recommendations to other people to by the same, but now, how do I fix my face to say to these same people, that ether this product is still in its experimental development stage, I was the customer\u201d gunny pig\u201d and sad to say, this experiment failed.I unboxed and use the portable washing machine for the first time yesterday. There was a clicking sound coming from the timer and that\u2019s the only thing that was working on this washing machine. As for the twisting at the bottom, I heard it, only after several times playing with the niggle, but trust me, there was no washing going on in that bucket at all, and then I thought it had some time to do with the voltage or watts, but my research yield that this was not the case, I made several attempts to wash my clothes, but then I gave up, the thing is a failure, and I want a full refund.Question what about quality control, are these things not tested before you allow them to leave your factory, and yes, I see there is a one year warranty, but because I live outside the UNITED STATES, it would be too costly to return, and so there goes my lost. I thought that in the long run, I would save, but all I have in my bathroom is a plastic barrel which I currently have no use for. I will research what legal rights I have in this matter. What a complete disappointment and a waste of my hard-earned money. this is a great idea, however, especially in taught times where people like myself are trying to find ways to the same money, under the right conditions this product would be an asset to me. but guess I am that unlucky sucker. dam!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a portable laundry machine as I live in a big apartment building and have had bad experiencess using the shared laundry facilitiy on each floor. I did a lot of research and given my price range, this product seemed to be the best fit. I was not expecting incredible performance for the price point, however, I was pleasantly surprised after I reieved it and actually started using it. Please either watch some other review videos or read other reviewers as there are certain things you should keep in mind/do when using it. For example, do not overfill and make sure you are not just putting massive weight of clothes in. If the load fails to move much, you probably have it overfilled. If you hear strange noises in the rotation, or smell burning plastic/rubber, you are probably overfilled. Watch/learn how to use the basket used for drying. It will remove like 90% of the water in just a few min. Then it only takes a few minutes to dry out competely after you hang them.I also have my machine a bit elevated which eliminates the need for any type of water pump for draining as gravity handles it pretty well. I also purchased some sound dampening feet and use ratchet/tie down straps (refer to pics) as I have my machine on elevated platform made of metal. The feet reduced the noise when operating significantly. The tie downs also made a huge difference.f this product is within your budget range, I would recommend using it. But you need to learn how to use it properly and have your expecations set realistically.",

Really surprised how dry it leaves the clothes. Only one problem , I was putting it away moving off of the counter when I noticed a dust of rubber underneath , mind you this is my first day using this. I looked underneath, and it appears to be a rubber belt , idk what\u2019s it\u2019s purpose but it looks like it might be rubbing up on something to its scrapping it leaving rubber dust all over underneath and falling thru. I\u2019m not sure how long till it breaks apart. There\u2019s no way of even getting a hold of customer support for this. Might just return before it\u2019s too late.",
