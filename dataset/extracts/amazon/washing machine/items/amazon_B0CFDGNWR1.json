                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I feel that this compact washer is very easy to use. The instructions were easy to follow. I do not think that you can put very many items in the bucket at one time. But, if you are washing your delicates, a lot of the time you don\u2019t really have a large quantity or those items are smaller in size anyway. You could fit a couple of bras, or a few pairs of panties or several pair of pantyhose would be another good item to use in this washer. There is no set amount of water that they specify you should use to fill the bucket. They only say you should not overfill it. So, I think you need to experiment with it on a trial run to get an idea of how full to fill it. I think how much water you use would vary depending on how many items you\u2019re washing at a time as well. They do not specify what kind of detergent you should use, or how much. I just used the same soap that I would use if I was hand washing my delicates. There is no spin dry option available; but again, if you\u2019re just washing your delicates, I typically use a towel to roll them in to get the excess water out anyway. I think that this is a nice luxury item to use for things that you would typically hand wash. This washer gives you the luxury of putting a few things in it and walking away, knowing that your things are getting washed in a very thorough way. There are three wash settings that you can choose from. You can wash for one minute, three minutes, or five minutes. I like those options. There are four suction cups at the bottom of this tank. They will keep the washer from moving around on your counter. They work very well and seem to be pretty strong. The other nice feature that this washer has is that it collapses pretty flat. It will not take up a lot of space to store while not in use. Overall, I think this is a good investment. I find that more and more I am hand washing items that I really do not want to put in a sink where there could be residue of other cleaning products lurking. I love being able to have a separate device to wash all of my delicates. I also love the fact that I can set it and forget it, knowing it will shut off automatically. I think that this is a pretty durable little device and I would recommend it.",

The controls seems to function well though the instructions are abysmal. It does in fact seems to cycle according to the 3 settings. The bucket itself seems decently made.Now the reasons that I can't give this a good rating. I believe that you could get a better result by hand washing in the basin as opposed to the job this does \"automatically\". My test runs (I did several) were with some rags I use in my outdoor kitchen. Some were very dirty while others were only slightly dirty. A couple of the really dirty ones I ran through more than once. In my opinion, they came out wet, but no cleaner than going in (though to be fair, the water was dirty after, so some dirt did come out). You must hand wring and change out water to rinse. Basically it just agitates for the specified time. For the amount of the work it requires, I don't see the upside.",

                "reviewText": "First, here are the instructions that you all are missing because they did NOT get covered in the included booklet:\u2022Leave basket out of the machine.\u2022Insert clothing and fill to the fill line inside the basket with water.\u2022Add a little detergent.\u2022Wash for required length of time.\u2022Drain bucket and squeeze out clothing.\u2022Refill with fresh water and run for desired time to rinse soap away.\u2022Empty bucket.\u2022Insert basket pieces and put clothing in basket.\u2022Run for desired time to get excess water out of clothing.Ok. I struggled at first. The instructions are severely lacking. The machine comes with tubes but it gives no clues as to where they go at all. I googled to try to figure it out and looked at other listings of the same product and finally figured out that the long one is supposed to go to the top as a water inlet tube but it won\u2019t work with American spigots so that\u2019s not something I would use and isn\u2019t necessary as I can just use my sink or even a jug to fill it and the tube is just a waste. I believe the smaller tube is supposed to be to extend the water drain but this seems like it would just be more likely to allow water to spill and leak so I didn\u2019t use it or try it to see if it fits.My lid for the washer came warped so it doesn\u2019t actually cover anything but it\u2019s fine as the water stays in anyway.They explain putting the basket together but not what it\u2019s used for. Google helped me with that. You wash the clothing without the basket so you can get proper movement for the clothes. Then drain and refill for rinsing. Then you pull everything out and put the basket in with the bucket empty of water and throw in the wet clothes and run again with the clothes in the basket to get excess water out of the clothing. Because this wasn\u2019t explained in any way in the instructions I thought, at first, that the basket should be in at all times and assumed that 2 wash rags was all I could wash at a time but the basket kept floating away which was annoying. Once I figured it out everything worked well though and my nasty dishrags that my boys used but didn\u2019t rinse off came out very clean.",
