                "reviewText": "Don\u2019t get me wrong: This is a good, portable, compact mini-cleaner. My review cons for the product itself would be (1) no lock/latch on the lid to keep it down when the cycles are in use. The lid bounces open slightly, causing water/foam to splash out; and (2) the spin cycle basket did not stay in place for longer than a minute, even after multiple attempts to reattach it. You really need to press down hard on such a light-weight machine to click the basket into a locked position.My major problem is: How difficult is it to provide complete directions on how to USE the product?!? Sure, the collapsible feature is enticing, but does it take 7 of the 12 instructional photos provided to demonstrate how to do this? And then how to turn on the unit and push a cycle button? Does that really take an additional 3 pictures? There\u2019s 10 out of 12 steps taken for \u201cduh\u201d instructions. What about:\u2753 How much water to use? True, its capacity is an impressive 10 liters (a little over 2.5 gallons), but by definition capacity = maximum. What if you\u2019re using less water? Ok\u2026maybe another product \u2018ding\u2019 would be water level markers on the inside of the \u201cfuselage\u201d (aka: the basin) to see how much water you are pouring in.\u2753 Recommendations as to how much detergent to use per X amount of water? (Be conservative: drip detergent in slowly and keep a watch on the foam factor, peeking under the latchless lid)\u2753 Guidance to use the basket only for the \u201cdehydration\u201d mode (aka: spin cycle). Goodness knows, it didn\u2019t stay on for a full spin, but it was handy to use to rinse the clothes in the sink after the wash cycle(s). Also, could one use the 10 minute cycle for the actual wash, the stronger 5 minute cycle for a rinse, and then \u201cdehydrate\u201d?\u2753 Cleaning instructions: advice on how to drain the soapy water. The other side of the instructions (\u201cSafety Precautions\u201d) has all the legal disclaimers\u2026it does state not to pour water on the lower part of the machine (obviously, where the mechanisms are). So, no lifting the light-weight unit under running water to rinse it out. What is recommended then? Also, any suggested steps (perhaps a good wipe/dry-down of the unit and return the drain pipe to its tucked-in position) before one follows the last 4 pictures on how to collapse it...Argh! I don\u2019t want to give the unit a poor review since it\u2019s very versatile, rather quiet and goodness knows those strong magnets certainly earn their keep. I\u2019ve attached enhanced instructions to try to help, because for mobile purposes to use on the road, in a dorm or RV, or just for a small load at home, it\u2019s a good thing. But\u2026",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This little washing machine is actually a little bigger than I expected, but it\u2019s easy to setup and works fairly good. I wanted to push it to more than just washing super small items like socks, and put in 5 pairs of underwear, a tshirt and a pair of leggings. They all washed well, surprisingly, but because I slightly overloaded it, it didn\u2019t spin or swish as much - but it did enough. I added the water after the clothes, but I\u2019d now recommend adding the water and detergent before the clothes. The dehydrating spin mode to wring the clothes out was a little frustrating , though. First, the basket would only hold the underwear - it was too small to hold all the pieces I washed to I had to split them. Then the basket wouldn\u2019t stay well on the spinner. Every time I\u2019d start the spin, it was so fast that the basket flew off the spinner. It took about ten times to get the basket on just right for it to stay on during the spin. Other than that, it\u2019s a pretty handy little washer that\u2019s good as a backup or to pack if traveling.",

It did spin(ish) with only 4 pair of underwear. There are no instructions included, except for how to expand and fold back to small. To drain it the drain pipe has to be lower than the machine.",
