                "reviewText": "I like this story. Susie has a box full of dirty, sticky, stained, and painted stuffed animals all in need of a major cleaning. Rather than bemoaning the situation, Susie gently places each friend in the washing machine, adds soap, and starts the machine. Some of the animals love it, some not so much. Nevertheless, they are all on their way to being clean again.While I don't know that I would let Susie use my washing machine by herself, I think this is a great teaching tool: when you make a mess, you need to help clean it up. Ask an adult for help, but you need to be part of the process. You can't use the machine by yourself, but you can gather the animals, get them in the machine and help measure and add the soap. Nowadays a child can add a detergent pod without help. Let an adult set the machine and show the child how to start it. HOWEVER, stress the fact they should never do this without an adult unless you want to clean all the suds from a room or two full of suds.",
