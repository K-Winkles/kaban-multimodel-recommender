                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this little washer/spin dryer combo. I'm a 90 lb weakling and I can lift this to set it on the table to wash. I place it on top of a throw rug which helps keep it quieter and less likely to shimmy (you could use a rubber mat, too.) It is just a bit too big to fit on my kitchen counter and because the power cord and the drain tube are low, near the bottom of the machine, putting it in the tub is out. I fill it with a bucket. I drain into a bucket; it drains with gravity. All of this is worth it to me so that I do not have to go out to do laundry. It will handle 4-5 pairs of leggings; or 4-5 short sleeve shirts; or 3 long sleeve knit shirts with some smaller items like socks. It's great for socks and underwear, night gowns, pillow cases. I use it to wash my dishcloths and dish towels--with bleach (bleach is ok in this machine.) I use it to wash hand towels and thin bathroom towels. I emphasize thin bath towels. I have seen reviews of people claiming they wash heavy jeans and towels in this. I'm sure you can, but you would need to reduce the size of the load to compensate. I don't cram the washer full. One of those enormous plush bath towels might be a load in this machine. The directions say to use cool or warm water, not scaldingly hot. I usually rinse twice. (Rinsing is just filling the washer with cold water, letting it agitate for a few minutes and then draining.) A whole, filled to the 'H' line load only takes at most 1 tablespoon of detergent. (Most people use too much detergent even in a full-size washer.) I usually set the washer to 9 minutes, but none of my clothes are heavily soiled. The spin cycle it is about as loud as a blender. The wash is about as loud as a relatively quiet vacuum cleaner. I wring the rinsed clothes by hand (over the stopped washer tub as it is draining and pack them evenly in the spin dryer. The 'lid' for the spin dryer will fit; you have to angle it to get it in, then it should be firmly shoved down on top. It is loudest as it is powering up and down. If you hear a really loud racket the load is probably unbalanced and/or the lid is not in place. The clothes come out really clean and the spin dryer really works--1-2 mins of spinning and the clothes are almost dry. I can wash lightweight items in the morning and they are dry by evening (this depends on the humidity of the room, of course.) If you must wear a uniform every day--this is an ideal way to care for them. This was well worth the purchase to me for its convenience. I will still use a commercial laundromat for bedspreads and other really big items.",

                "reviewText": "So this washer was doing great while it lasted, and it lasted only for 2.5 months!I purchased this in mid-January 2022 and was in moderate use (about 2-3 cycles per week) for about 2 months. It was small, compact, easy to use and easy to store away. It didn't require any special installation or plumbing. I live in a mid-rise apartment building and it saved me multiple trips up/down to the basement laundry rooms. Bought it for about USD 170 including taxes. I figured that since I am spending about $7 every 2 weeks for coin-operated laundry, if this machine lasts me 1 year, I would have recovered my cost then. Due to the cost and cheap constructions, I was not expecting this to last 5 or 10 years. I was being realistic.In early April, the motor died and stopped working, after only 2.5 months. I thought that this was too soon, even for a cheap brand! I contacted Pyle USA for repair service (under 1 year warranty) and they are understanding and supportive. (No more return/money back though since it was purchased for over 30 days). However, they will not cover the cost of shipping to and from them. Shipping to Pyle's Brooklyn office for repair costs USD 70 from the East Coast and probably another USD 70 to ship it back to me. So at USD 140 cost of shipping, it's almost the price you paid for the equipment. You will have to decide whether it's worth repairing or whether just to buy another product or just write it off.I should have listened to my gut feeling when I first got this product and returned the item to Amazon within the 30-day free return period. I've had doubts about the quality and was feeling that this will not last that long. Save your money and buy something else.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Seriously, this is the washer/dryer for me... for anyone who lives alone or in a apartment with no washer/dryer, who has the ability to hang dry after using the spin-dry cycle.First off, the washer/spin dryer is super light, much much lighter than the usual washer/dryers you can get at a store.Of course you don't get the capacity you would have with a big store bought washer/dryer. Thats the one downfall.However! I am able to wash 2-3 large work shirts and 3 pairs of underwear in one load. I always put it to the max, 15 mins for wash cycle, then you drain, and do a rinse cycle. Total of about 30 mins. Not bad if you are home with not much else to do on the weekends.Make sure to only use a SMALL amount of detergent, table spoon or teaspoon size or you will get an overflow of suds and have to do multiple rinse cycles.The spin cycle is a bit smaller, so I can dry about 2 large shirts and 2 underwear at a time. Or 2 bath towels. The spin cycle takes about 5 mins to run at max, I sometimes turn it for longer to get all the water out most I can.Don't forget to even out the weight of the items in the spin-dryer as it can damage it, not spinning correctly.Also! If you forget to stop the water from filling up the washer side, don't worry! It has drainage right near the top if you do forget. I've done that multiple times.Seriously worth the investment, it is a bit loud using the spin-cycle, but it gets the job done, and energy efficient compared to a conventional washer/dryer.The issue I have with this is, if you wash a bath towel and a shirt, or socks and pants together and dry them together, you will get little fuzz all over the shirt/pants... as its not a traditional dryer... so you'll have to do them separately. Or spend a long time taking off the fuzzies.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is surprisingly good for what it is.I mean, it is heaps better than washing your clothes by hand. It has a compartment that will agitate and wash and one that will spin, and pretty well too.The unit has to be higher than the drain though, as there is no pump, so be aware.Also, I could not get the intake hose to go onto the laundry room faucet. I was using this as a temporary replacement for my washing machine, so I just filled it manually with the laundry hook up hoses when I washed.Just be aware: this thing will wash your clothes, but it does not not replace a decent full size washing machine. In a pinch though, or if you have nothing else, then it can be a life saver; this unit is semi-automatic, meaning you will have to do a lot of the switching manually; the spin compartment is not a dryer, it is just the spin portion that is normally part of a wash cycle - it works very well once you get the hang of putting the disc on the top, but it is bizarrely half the size of the wash compartment - you can run a wash and spin at the same time, but what's the point if you half the load yet to to be spun. The capacity is of course very small...two or three towels for example and that's it. I would say this is a decent unit for what it is, it beats hands washing. It really can be a great tool if you have nothing else, but be prepared to adapt and overcome, and to be there to do stuff manually.",

                "reviewText": "BUYER BEWARE, this product is a SCAM! We had this washer for just 3 months, we used it about 4 times each month and it completely stopped working. I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the mixed reviews, but I always take very good care of electro domestics etc. so I thought the problems other people were having were because they were not being careful, but as I said, the use I got from it was MINIMAL and it stopped working. Just don't risk it, $200 wasted! DON'T BUY! The washer AND spinner both completely stopped. After going back and forth with customer support the only \"solution\" that they offered was for me to ship the washer to their warehouse in NY and pay myself for the shipping, I live in Canada, this is not a small item to ship, I searched shipping costs and it would range from $100-$200! And they would not reimburse me that money, it is a SCAM, they know no one would accept to pay that for shipping so I feel like it's just their way of saying that they offer a guaranteed product but then when you actually need to redeem that so-called warranty that's what you end up with!",
