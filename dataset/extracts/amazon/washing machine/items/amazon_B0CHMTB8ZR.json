                "reviewText": "First of all, the box with the product had double tape, a sure sign (usually) that the item had been opened and/or used before.But, I went ahead, opened it, read the instructions and put it together.1. No, you can't manually fill it, you have to use the filler hose.2. Once you put the filler hose into the washer you can't remove it. Maybe the 250, 6'3\" neighbor might be able but I used my old mini washer (diff. company) almost daily and I'm not going to bother him every single day.3. filler hose cannot be pulled ouf the doohinky that's supposed to fit your faucet, which it didn't. F**** water everywhere. grrrr4. trying to pack it up for return near impossible because the dang filler hose can't be pulled out and you can't fold it to it's tiniest shape because the stupid hose is in the way.I'm going back and buyig my cheap little unit again. It might be too small and take me more loads than I want to do but at least i know it will work.horrible experiece.",

                "reviewText": "This unit wouldn't suction to my countertop in my RV. My countertop is sort of rough and the suction cups on the bottom of the unit would not adhere. Therefore, when the Drain/Spin started, the unit would shake right off the countertop if I had not hung on really tight. Also, you can only put one or two items in the drain/spin basket. If you put too much in, the basket will detach from the bottom of the unit. In the end, it would be easier and quicker just to wash the items by hand. Sending it back.",

                "reviewText": "This is not pink not even baby pink it is a weird peach, color not true peach has a little bit of something in it. That's throwing the color off i'm guessing it was a factory mishap so my bucket is a color misfit\ud83e\udd74 \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22 color does not go with my bathroom at all if I would've known, it was more peach I would've bought the white and gray bucket as you can see with the pictures the difference between peach and pink that is a disappointment\ud83e\udd75 The upgrade is the fact that its automatic, if the adapter will fit, your sink I'm using it manually. I already have a larger, portable washer with a bidet sink sprayer that is attached to my faucet for filling so I will not benefit from the automatic features on this machine If you're using this in the manual mode it washes for about 10 minutes and then will drain automatically. I don't like this because I want more wash time there are no increments of time as the picture indicates so I leave the hose up after the 10 minutes since the hose is up, it does not go into the automatic drain cycle what I do is I turn the machine off and then turn it back on and give it another 10 minutes to wash I think it would be best to use this in the automatic mode if you're able to do so in the manual mode l feel like I need more than 10 minutes to get my clothes clean without it automatically draining. I had to buy this because my socks, even in a zippered bag were disappearing from my portable, washer if the bag comes unzipped, then the washer has eaten my socks. Also with the portable washer clothes are a tangled mess. I always use the bags but a lot of times they come unzipped the agitation is good the basket did stay on. I have only used this once I just got it. I will update my review after I have used it for a while and see how it doesUpdated review! There are some nice features on this machine. There is some semi automatic options that you have in the manual mode. This would be a really great machine. If you wanted to use it in the automatic mode, you wouldn't be filling the bucket, draining the bucket it is totally automatic and the price is nice I have enough trust in this machine I'm not babysitting it I just got done using it for the second time, I decided to order another one because of the quality the basket didn't fly off I was able to add a couple of drain cycles or for extra spinning time The clothes are not sopping wet. They are wet, but not dripping wet. You would be able to hang them with no problem and let them dry overnight. I think I like this machine. The machine that I'm getting is the white and gray I'm keeping this I'll keep this in my bathroom and then I'll have one out in the kitchen for towels things I need to wash quick when I make a mess etc. give this a try I think that you can make this work in the automatic mode. With your sink, you might have to do some improvising, but I believe it can be doneSome updates so I've used it again the basket flew off a couple of times you'll have to make sure that your clothes are balanced. You will have to probably make sure that you're not too far away from the washer in case the basket does come off you will have to turn off the machine, it serves its purpose. The basket doesn't do well overloaded.The basket staying on is going to be a 50-50 thing. It's not quite a dealbreaker but the more I'm using it I'm seeing the basket flaw, which is a constant complaint with these portable washers there has to be some way that the basket actually hooks or has a mechanism to hold the basket in placeUpdate I gave up on trying to get that basket to stay on. I have a portable washer. I use that spinner to spin dry my clothes. If you can keep the basket from coming off, then you should play the lottery. Your luck is enormous.",
