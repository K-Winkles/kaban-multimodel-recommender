WHEN I OPEN THE PACKAGE, I FIND RUST INSIDE THE TUB, WHY WOULD THIS HAPPEN? Dear customer, the rust in the barrel may have been caused by improper transportation which led to leakage of the balancing brine in the balancing ring.

Dear customer, there're detailed error list and solution in our detail page, you could download and see if you could solve that. If not, our technical staff will help you.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve waited to write this review until I really put this washer to the test. It\u2019s been about 3 months and I\u2019m still loving it. I switched from a twin tub washer so there\u2019s a lot to love but I\u2019ll give some details below.Capacity: I tried a queen size sheet set (fitted, flat and two pillowcases) and It fit fine. I can fit a queen sized light blanket in a load. It probably won\u2019t fit a heavy blanket like a comforter. For clothes you can fit a small sized laundry basket full. About 1-2 pair jeans, 1-2 pair yoga pants and about 5 shirts and a few handfuls of socks. To do a weeks worth of clothes it takes 2-3 loads to get it done depending on if I wash jackets etc.Ease of use: This little washer is so easy to use! You select your water level, then your wash level (light, heavy etc) and hit start! The heavy load takes about an hour and the quick wash takes about half hour.Cleanliness: I have used both heavy and light wash cycles and I haven\u2019t noticed a difference in cleanliness, smell etc. This washer gets clothes clean really well. It has a lint trap but it doesn\u2019t really remove lint very well. If you have a dryer that\u2019s no problem. I hang dry so I just shake the clothes well to get any lint off and so far have no problem after clothes are dry. The washer itself stays clean as well which is really nice.Connections: This comes with an adapter to hook to a sink. It has a hose for the water inlet with a quick connect fitting that will hook to the adapter. It has a built in drain hose and a drain pump to get the water out. It uses a normal wall plug in, nothing special needed there.Noise level: This washer is very quiet. I have it In the bathroom and can\u2019t hear it outside the room unless it\u2019s spinning and even then I have to get closer to the bathroom to hear it.Spin cycle: This won\u2019t matter probably unless you are like me and don\u2019t have a dryer but this washer will get clothes mostly dry so they are just damp when removing. It spins very well and there is never any soaked clothes. If your clothes come out soaked check that your washer is draining all the way. For even my heavier garments I will put a fan on them after hanging them up and they are dry in a few hours.The bad: The pump on this washer isn\u2019t super strong, you have to have your drain only a few inches above the floor. Mine is approximately 6-8 inches off the floor and because of this the drain hose does not completely empty. So far it\u2019s not an issue but I do laundry once a week. If it sat longer I would imagine it would smell. One way to help with this if the washer will sit is to put it on a self cleaning cycle. That will run clean water through it. If your clothes do not dry and everything seems to be functioning correctly I would check that the washer is able to drain the water after the rinse cycle. If it\u2019s not your hose may be too high.Overall I recommend this washer for someone not looking to spend a lot and that doesn\u2019t expect it to work like a $3000 washer. It is perfect for a couple or an apartment. If you had enough space it would even fit in an RV. I\u2019m so happy with this product even after doing probably 50 loads of laundry.",

                "reviewText": "Had a rough start with it. I don't recommend using it in the kitchen, unless you absolutely have to. IF you have a bathtub, I recommend using the washer in the restroom and putting the drainage hose in the tub. There is no way to get the hose to stay in the sink unless you're there holding it. I had a leak somehow the first time I used it. I couldn't figure out what was going on. I just knew that there was water leaking from somewhere at the bottom of the machine. I think it was because the drainage hose isn't very long and it was kind of stretched the first time I tried it in the kitchen. After I moved it to the bathroom there were no leaks anymore. This machine is a lot bigger than I was expecting, which is a good thing. Don't buy this thinking it's gonna fit in a small space. Don't get me wrong, it is smaller than the average washing machine, but not by much. This is the biggest mobile washing machine I have ever seen. It works well and I have no doubts about its abilities to wash full-sized loads. The only real downside to it is that there is no \"rinse only\" option. There are \"wash only\" and \"spin only\" but no \"rinse only\" which sucks. If you want to do an extra rinse, you're not able to without just running the washer again and not putting in any detergent. I added these photos, showing the wet towels on the floor because of the leak and also the Costco branded laundry detergent container so you guys can see for size comparison how big this machine is. Hope this helps.",
