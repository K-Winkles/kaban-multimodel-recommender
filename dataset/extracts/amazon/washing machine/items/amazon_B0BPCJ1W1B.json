I'm not a large woman either, but there is no way my pants are fitting in there! It's actually a really nice washer. Functionally, it works well. Had it been twice the size as the basket is now, I would have been super happy. I feel like they could have easily done that without much difficulty actually. There's no way that I'm hauling this thing around with me to be able to wash two pairs of underwear and a few pairs of sock. So I gave it to my granddaughter. It just so happened that she had asked me for Christmas, a kids pretend watching machine for her Barbies. So, when she got the real thing... she was over the moon happy! Now she is the envy of all her friends and they all can't wait to come spend the night and be able to wash their Barbies clothes too!So although it didn't work out for my uses because of the basket size, I've got a very happy 9 year old granddaughter & friends; that are joyfully learning to do laundry with her Barbie's clothes.",

                "reviewText": "We ordered this 7 L capacity portable washing machine for us to use at our vacation home and we really like that it\u2019s quite portable and not heavy to carry at only 16.3 LB. Our son was able to readily and easily get all the connecting parts and installed it and in less than 30 minutes this mini portable washer was really to be used.We do like that it comes with a lot of great features; the spin dry, the automatic water inflow and drainage, and the triple anti- scalding displacement system. My favorite things about this durable and reliable washer are the fully automatic system, the quiet operation, even when placed on a countertop or table top, and the precise temperature control. We have been washing with it for over the last 5 weeks now, and we do like that it\u2019s pretty easy to use by following the simple instructions, comes with a bottom portable handle and mostly importantly, we are able to add clothes mid- way through the washing and it works great. I also do like that it does a good job of rinsing and cleaning after each wash. Considering the quality, the functionality and the price point, this mini washer with double door cover is definitely a great value for money. Highly recommended.",

I have tried other small ones that honestly did not work very well, but that is not the case with this one, and this is my first time trying a little washer that is fully automatic. It is very small and you cannot wash very much at a time, but this would be great for a dorm, camper, cabin, or traveling. It is super easy to hook up and use, and the loads take 35 to 45 minutes.",

I started off testing it with 4 pairs of underwear and by the end It became painfully clear it could barely handle 1 pair. It's a neat Idea but the machine clearly doesn't have a very strong motor. When it came to the spin to wring out the water (done with only one pair), it couldn't get any of the water out of it because it was spinning so slow. It was too full of water to throw in the dryer or hang up so I ended up running it through my washer on a rinse and spin. I had hoped this would be good for a uniform shirt or a piece of clothing you need to wear repeatedly, (I had to sink wash before when living in an apartment with no wash facilities). I think this machine is extremely impractical and unless it had a much stronger motor not worth using",
