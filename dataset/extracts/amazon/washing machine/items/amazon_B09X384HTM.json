                "reviewText": "Very disappointing. This little washing machine arrived defective or broken (or just poorly made, altogether). The On/Off button didn't work, and there were no English instructions, so I tried many things to get it to work. I finally pushed just above the button and could sometimes get it to turn on, but it was hit and miss, and changing time settings also only worked now and then. So much effort to just get it on and running! When I did get it running, I put a couple small washcloths in it and thought it was going to tip over-- very unstable, and the cheap plastic was bulging where the 2 cloths were turning around inside. The spin basket threw water everywhere and the lid doesn't fit on tightly. I'm usually very \"forgiving\" and do my best to make a product work for me, to support small businesses, and so I don't have to go to the trouble to return it, but I just couldn't keep this. It worked so poorly. I'm returning it today.",
