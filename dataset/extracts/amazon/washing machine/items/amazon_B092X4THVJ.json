                "reviewText": "This is a million times more effective and easier than using your hands to squish wash water through fabric. And the design & size of the head make it much better than a toilet plunger with holes drilled into it. Yes, the head unscrews slowly but surely while you're using it. And it you tighten it repeatedly, the threads will fail. The simple solution is a good plastic glue. I used a glue a bit thicker than super glue in case all the threads didn't meet well. And, because the other joints also have plastic threads, and because the longer the handle the more stress any sideways force will cause, I attached the handle directly to the head (omitting the other two sections). This works great for me whether my bucket is in the bathtub or on the kitchen counter. When I use the washer, I always only move it up & down perpendicular to the floor (never on an angle), and never push hard on a resistant lump (like jeans). I also never twist it or use it to reposition items in the wash. I wear long rubber gloves so if needed I can reach and move items around. Totally worth the money and the little bit of modification!",

                "reviewText": "I didn't know these existed. Now that I know I think they are just wonderful. I have two. One for my handwash and one for the cat's laundry. The cat's stuff can't go into the machine because his hair will clog the drain there. As some other reviewers have pointed out you have to watch out that the handle might come undone. That's why I took a star off on \"lightweight.\" Too lightweight isn't a good thing. But if you give the thing it a twist in the right direction while you use it that won't be an issue. In the long run I may try glueing it or putting an aluminum pipe over the handle part. But just for now it makes doing the handwash a breeze and I can do the cat's laundry with a lint trap in the drain. I also love that I can do his laundry separate from mine and don't have to think about cleaning a machine off icky stuff cat messes before using it for stuff that I'll wear. I saw a similar model with a wood handle. Wet wood is not a good idea here. (Humid climate.) If they ever make an all cast aluminum or stainless model I'd be first in line to buy that. Except for coming in separate pieces these plastic ones work fine. I can't say anything about the longevity yet, but I'm not too worried. If these break I now know where to get more. I'm using them with Dollar store tubs, but will probably upgrade to using a bucket once I can go out and buy one. (Current online bucket prices are usury.) Even if you only use one of these every now and then it's a good buy and they don't take a lot of space. I don't use washable floor mops, but if I did I'd get another one of these washers just for that purpose.",

I filled the connections with Sugru, hoping to prevent that. So far so good. I cannot disassemble it but that's fine for me. I use it almost every day to wash sweaty gym clothes immediately after working out.I own a Laundry Alternative hand crank laundry machine, which my husband still prefers, but I prefer plunging in a bucket in my bathtub, maybe simply because I think it's faster to fill and dump the bucket water into the tub as opposed to draining the laundry machine. (Also for us we don't have enough space to keep the LA machine in our bathroom and use it outside w a hose, and it would be a hassle to move the machine around. With a bucket and this plunger wand I can easily carry it in and out of my bathroom)Also I started putting my whole small load of hand wash laundry in a mesh bag when using this wand/plunger, I think it helps to keep all the small items together and forces every piece to push through the water together instead of ending up on top of the plunger. I assume this helps the washing.",

                "reviewText": "The theory behind this product seems convenient, but do yourself a favor and buy one that\u2019s all one piece instead.I can\u2019t return it because I missed the return window, but this has been gently used twice before and it broke today on the third use.It also doesn\u2019t actually work as it\u2019s meant to to begin with. You can use it to gently plunge the water in a bucket around but it can\u2019t be moved from side to side. Even gently plunging it will cause the connections to come loose. I should have returned it after the first use, but thought I\u2019d make due with a less than stellar product instead of going to the trouble.",
