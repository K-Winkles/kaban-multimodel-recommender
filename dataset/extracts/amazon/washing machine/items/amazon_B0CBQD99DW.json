                "reviewText": "This product is very misleading and disappointing. On the listing here it says the wash capacity is 6.6 lbs; however, in the instruction manual is says it is 2.2 lbs! So this is flat out deception. I haven\u2019t even used it because the directions are useless. Here is an example \u201calign the notches of the six card slots on the spin basket.\u201d Ok, I get what a spin basket is, but what are \u201ccard slots\u201d? That is never explained. There are extra plastic ring pieces that are also not explained; they just show a picture of them, and they show two but I have three, and there is no where that I can see that they should go. I don\u2019t want to break something and then not be able to return it.Here is another example from the directions: \u201cDO NOT use water to wash the case of the washing machine.\u201d Two sentences later: \u201cyou can use wet wipes to wipe the case.\u201d So\u2026 I can\u2019t use water on my washing machine? But wet wipes are ok? I mean, I would assume water is more gentle that wet wipes. And wet wipes are also\u2026 wet, so\u2026 I don\u2019t really understand that.There is also no explanation on how to actually wash the clothes, other than put the water and detergent in there with the clothes. I guess then I drain it; but how do they ever get rinsed? Do I then add more water? Do I run it at a different setting for a rinse?I tried calling the customer service number, but all that happens is there is a recording saying \u201cwelcome\u2026dialing\u201d and it just repeats that over and over.I am so disappointed. I\u2019m going to have to return this because it is un-useable. I suspect it\u2019s just vague so you break it and can\u2019t return it. And the 6.6 wash capacity is a flat out lie. This is more cheap junk from Amazon. I should learn my lesson and stop buying things here. At least they have a decent return policy.",

But she really needs to at least be able to was undergarments in between laundry trips . This was the perfect option for her so she can wash a fewThings here and there and then hang fry.We love that it folds down and takes up very little space!! It can wash up to 6.6 pounds . It can hit wash and spin dry. It\u2019s so easy to use and definitely worth the money especially in the colder months when it\u2019s harder to get out! It comes with everything need including a drain hose. It has a carry handle for moving too. Great for convenience.",
