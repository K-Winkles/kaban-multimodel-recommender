                "reviewText": "SEVERAL UPDATES AT THE END.So far this thing is fabulous. The first day I got it I used it all day long, load after load after load and it worked wonderfully.The spinner did a far, far better job than I expected! Obviously the clothes are not dry but they don\u2019t have much water left in them (unless it\u2019s like a towel). Very impressed with the spinner.It does get unbalanced sometimes, of course, but you get the hang of it. so far at least this is not been a problem. (Also, I have found that if I press firmly on the lid of the spinner the balance issue often resolves itself.)The tube that comes with it for filling the washing compartment with water is useless (waay too short). But if you get a RinsaRoo you can easily fill it from a shower head or a sink faucet.To rinse: After washing cycle stops, let the dirty water drain out, pull the wet clothes out (then I drop them in the spinner side), l refill the washer with clean water, put the clothes back in, then run it again to rinse.For me, the only downside of this otherwise awesome item is that it drains by gravity. So I don\u2019t know how one would use it if it were not in a bathtub or shower stall. I put mine in the tub for easy drainage.In summary:My clothes get clean. The spinner does a great job. It\u2019s neither loud nor quiet. It is easy to change the length of time for washing, rinsing, and spinning. It needs to be in a tub or shower stall because it drains by gravity. I used a Rinsaroo to fill the washer side. Though my Rinsaroo broke after a few months and now I just use a plastic pitcher.Lastly, overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.I\u2019m very satisfied with my purchase and have had no problems. Knock on wood, as I know that returning a large item like this would be a big hassle. And I have never had good experiences having to return things to China.Note, my suggestions re. the spin side. Use the provided white plastic disc in the spinner. Follow the directions (It goes on TOP of the clothes.) Press it down just a little bit onto the wet clothes before spinning. Do not fill to the top with clothes, and do not put one small thing - either seem to cause it to be unbalanced.UPDATE #1:AMZ = AMAZONI bought another washer (gift). It arrived with a LARGE hole in the box, not a good sign. Indeed, the machine received a long crack along the spinner side. :-(AMZ says I'm not eligible for a refund because it is a 3rd party seller.Their 3rd party policy says, \"Third-party sellers must either provide a return address within the United States, a prepaid return label, or offer a full refund without requesting the item be returned. If a seller does not offer these methods to return your items, you may file an A-to-z Guarantee claim to seek help with your return.\"I received no labels. So I can \"file a claim\" for help with a return. Which would cost MUCH more than I paid for the item.I wrote the company through AMZ's \"Problem with order\" page, which AMZ said I have to do.AMZ says, \"If the seller does not resolve your issue within 48 hours of the first message, you can revisit this page to check if you are eligible to request an A-to-z Guarantee refund.\"If the company says I have to return it (which would cost MUCH more than I paid for the item), that will be considered 'resolving the issue.' So, I'll be screwed.All I can do is hope the company will reimburse me or send another machine. (Both of which I am sure will not happen.)I will UPDATE this review as things move forward.UPDATE #2:Seller said they would send a replacement and it would arrive 12/08. Today's the 12th, it has not arrived.UPDATE #3:It arrived the 13th. Minor exterior damage (probably from the large hole punched in the box), but it works just fine!The company provided very fast communication (using Amazon's communication platform) and resolved the issue. I am impressed!And I still love mine.UPDATE #4:Pair of underwear fell between the drum & exterior! But a coat hanger resolved getting the item out. Always use the plastic frisbee-thing when spinning!UPDATE #5:Spinner stopped working. I have tried/checked everything imaginable. Even followed a reviewer's advice and took off the back looking for things out of place or damaged. Nothing I can see. Another reviewer suggested letting the interior dry well as water gets in it easily. I left a hair dryer on low and facing the machine interior to dry it well. No luck.*** I'm super sad. ***(I paid $140 for it. Then when I bought one as a gift it was $100. Now it is $62! wth? I got so burned! funny/not funny)",

                "reviewText": "I've been washing our laundry by hand for a year now, using a plastic tote in the shower stall, or occassionaly taking big loads to relative's home to use their machines. This mini washer is a game changer! I wasn't sure it would fit in our tiny bathroom but it does! It's surprisingly quiet from other rooms, so the tenants in the units over probably don't notice it much. I was a bit skeptical that it would wash as well as it does. The first day it got here, I put it to the test.Y'all. This thing is amazing! The water came out all dingy and it wasn't dye, so you KNOW it's cleaning well. No need for hot water, either, in fact instructions say don't use hot because it could mess up the machine. Use a tiny amount of detergent. A few people mentioned that it cleans well enough it doesn't leave \"smelly pits\" which is a concern of mine. Can confirm, the pits are free of funk! :) Rinsing had the same steps as washing, minus the soap. The dryer/spinner part was my favorite. It really does get the clothes almost dry! It was barely damp after being spun. This cuts down on how long I have to leave it on the line outside. Better yet, I can now hang it on a drying rack indoors without worrying about the clothes dripping puddles like when I'd have to hand-wring them. This is a big plus because I live in a place prone to dust storms, and who wants to deal with line drying outdoors when it's raining or in the middle of winter? One thing that surprised me was how light it was. about 20 lbs is what it says in the description. I'm barely above 5 ft and have noodly arms and still could carry it about from room to room easiy when it's empty.Like others have noted, it holds a decent amount of clothes. 1 load in the washer for me could be one of the following: 2 sets of work scrubs/8 regular shirts/2 jeans/2 medium bath towels/1 full-size sheet/about a dozen items of kids' clothes. Another poster mentioned you should be able to see a vortex effect as it washes. The one time I didn't, I had to wash it again. A full load needs to be separated into smaller loads for the spinner to work properly, but it works so quickly it's hardly an issue. And it's a lot of fun to watch the clothes swishing around. Kind of like being in a car wash or watching those \"oddly satisfying\" cleaning videos.The downsides so far were short-lived. It had a bit of a learning curve. First, to fill it, the hose is long. Turns out I can't use this bathroom sink because the water would come back up the top of the hose instead of pushing up the loop down to the washer. Eventually I just removed the showerhead and stretched the hose to attach it, and that works perfectly because it goes straight down to the washer. A few times, I've gotten distracted and forgotten to swith the setting off of \"drain\" when I was filling it for a new load. That was annoying but an easy fix. Because the hose to drain the machine works by gravity and is SHORT, I had to get creative and try it a few different ways. Most people set it in their tub, but our shower stall floor is wonky so I've yet to try that. Initially I hooked the machine up in the kitchen, but then I had to drain it into a bucket and carry that to the bathroom to dispose. So I moved it to the bathroom, right next to the toilet. Drain the dirty water into a bucket and dump it into the toilet bowl. Right now the machine sits on the floor but I'd like to get something sturdy to elevate it, so I can skip the bucket step and just drain it directly to the toilet or shower drain. The machine does move a little as it starts up or winds down, so some no-skid stuff might be in order. Also, if you drain it into the bathtub, get something to catch the extra lint because there is some still floating around.Even though it requires all these steps to fill/drain instead of just pushing a button and walking away like the big ones, I think it's worth it compared to doing it all by hand or hauling it every week to a laundromat or a relative's place, especially as an introvert who'd rather stay home, not to mention having to get the little kids ready to go out. The clothes come out clean, it's quick and quiet, and efficient.",

So I was looking for something small enough to put on the counter top, and it does. Love it, it does a great job, easy to use. I live by myself, so it takes a while to do a full load,. with this machine makes it much easier. I don't put heavy stuff in it so it will last. But for underwear, sock, light shirts, light towels,, pajama's, dish towels and other light clothes its perfect. It will reduce my the full size washing machine load by 1/3. This machine is perfect if you have a baby or little ones. Less ware and tare on the big machine. I put a rubber mat underneath it well I am using it. It stores very well and is small enough to store in a closet.. great for delicates. and can save a shirt if it is stained. So, if you are locking for something like this, its perfect. It spins really well, but is not a dryer.",

Of course, we didn't want to be running clothes lines everywhere we're camped (equal amounts work & pleasure) so we did get a Panda portable dryer, as well.
