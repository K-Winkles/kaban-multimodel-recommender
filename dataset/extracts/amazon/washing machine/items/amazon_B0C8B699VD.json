                "reviewText": "We like to go camping and fishing, but even after packing for days, there isn't enough room in the car for all seven of us. I purchased it so that we wouldn't have to bring as much and so that we could wash our clothes while on vacation. This bucket-style portable washing machine is suitable for camping. Even if it only washes a few items at once, camping gives you plenty of time to do the task.This is convenient to take with you because it is lightweight and folds up small, making it simple to pack and transport. It is a bucket-style washer that washes clothing outside. The washer uses high-frequency vibration to thoroughly remove dirt while leaving no residue or allergens behind. It has a semi-automatic cleaning mechanism and a 15-minute timer knob that automatically resets when finished.Despite its compact size, this portable washing machine performs admirably. I just added the water, detergent, and laundry, then turned the dial to the appropriate time. When I was finished, I could start a new load. It is reasonably priced, performs effectively, and would be beneficial in an emergency event such as storms, power shortages, and other similar situations.",

                "reviewText": "This portable washing machines is perfect to wash an adult outfit or even jeans when you\u2019re in a a pinch or need to wash them separately from the rest of the clothes. It compact and able to be folded down but when expanded I was quite impressed with how much it can hold. Larger than other portable washing machines on the market right now ( I have purchased 2 others before this one). I run the cycle twice for my clothes, the first one with water and detergent to clean my clothes and a second time to rinse it after draining the water out and adding in new water. Definitely beats hand washing the clothes myself. Easy timer dial on the front so that I can pick the cycle length and let the machine do its job. It can hold an adult outfit and a little more. It\u2019s not only for undergarments and baby clothes. I\u2019m actually quite impressed with this machine.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this washer because I thought it also came with a spin cycle. Turns out it didn't, so I bought a cuisnart salad spinner and it's surprisingly good at getting most of the water out. I also already have a bucket at home so it wasn't a big deal filling the washer up myself instead of hooking it up to the sink like other washers. It's small enough to fit on the kitchen counter. It's not as quiet as I hoped it would be since I'm a little paranoid about my neighbors complaining. To me, it sounds like a dishwasher running. I would run it for two 15 min wash cycles then a 6 min rinse cycle to get the soap out. I read the other reviews and a little goes a long way for liquid detergent. My clothes came out smelling clean for the most part (except for one shirt that has a stubborn deodorant and sweat odor). I was able to wash my shirts (medium size in women's), undergarments, and pillow cases. I didn't wash any small towels because this washer doesn't have a lint collector and I didn't find any good ones to throw into the wash to collect lint. I did however make sure to have a mesh sink strainer to catch any lint. And I've read one review that said the towels would also leave lint all over the washer and next load of laundry. I think if you have heavily soiled clothes, it's best to use a regular washer but this works for light to normal soiled clothes. The only downside is that you can only wash a few items at a time and it's get tiring especially from wringing all the water out. And the motor overheats after 2 uses. I wait 1 hr between each load so the motor cools down. Overall, it's not bad if you need to only do small loads for small items and you can handle the 1 hr wait between each load.",
