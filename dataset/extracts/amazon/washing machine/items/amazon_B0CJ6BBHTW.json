It advises that you only use cold water, no big deal, but I have noticed that a small puddle appears from the middle of the machine after the washing is done. This isn't a turn off for me, but it might be user error (Too much water, too many clothes, etc.) [*it was user error]. There is a normal and standard mode, but I don't know what the difference is and the manual doesn't describe the settings.When the cycle is done, my clothes come out a little damp. The washing cycle is good enough to get rid of grease stains. The whole body of the machine is made of plastic but I would recommend this.",
