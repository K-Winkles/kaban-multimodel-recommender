Although, it can only wash smaller items it was able to do its job well at the beginning at least. Only after 3 uses I consider it still brand new. Unfortunately, it's already malfunctioning and I can't return since it's out of the 30 day period. It looks sturdy and the color is great but the quality is horrible. There's no explanation why a product that cost $45.00+ should begin to have issues to begin with. Why has it already stopped spinning? Please trust the other reviews and consider buying an alternative option. This portable washer ended up being a huge disappointment.",

The start button was not working same as the attached photo.So I thought of giving one more chance and tried to exchange but the same thing happened the start button like the photo attached. The start button had went up and was able to press when we put a key or something inside the hole. So 2nd time I thought of returning back and initiating the refund.",
