                "reviewText": "Smaller than I thought, lighter than I imagined (I'm 5'6 and I can carry this thing myself) and more power than you'd think. It does take quite a bit of time to wash a small basket of clothes. Took me 6 hours, 1 hr per load. You can only wash maybe 3 pairs of jeans (depending on size) at a time. I haven't tried to wash bath towels yet. The spin side is small, only one pair of jeans can fit in it. Towels may be too heavy to spin. But it will spin your clothes pretty dry. Very impressive.On YouTube there are videos of people living in tiny homes and in one, 15 gallons of water was used to wash. I'm not sure what the standard full size washer uses, but 15 gallons seemed like a lot. I live in an apartment, so I don't pay for the water usage only electricity. So I can't say, for now, how much of a money saver this is. I will say, I would get $100 in quarters to use the communal washer/dryer area a month. Hoping this will cost less.I use the washer in my bath tub. Because of the vibration of the spin cycle, I've had to place the washer on a towel to prevent it from sliding in the tub. The washer is fairly quiet when in use, but you can still hear it. You should be able to do a load of laundry without interrupting one's sleep if you needed to. Especially if it's in a bathroom and you can close the door.The draining is souly based on gravity. So make sure the draining tube is low enough to drain the water properly. Once I'm finished, I keep the doors open to allow the unit to dry once it has completely drained. Also, clean the tub floor when you're done doing laundry. It will be very slippery for the next person taking a shower. Let's not fall, shall we?If you have a big and tall enough cabinet, you can possibly fit this thing right in it. I have mine in a bedroom closet. Takes up no more room than one large peice of luggage.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because going to the laundromat began to become a real difficulty due to my long work schedule. I wasn\u2019t sure how it would fare or if it would consume a lot of water but I have been pleasantly surprised and very satisfied. I found a YouTube video online which convinced me to use this in my stand up shower so I could use the shower hose to fill the washer and allow it to drain easily. I fill it with a small amount of detergent and scent beads once full. And then the clothes go in. The reviewer recommended 3 minutes for the wash and that has usually been sufficient although I\u2019ve drained it after seeing dirty water and then filled it again/added soap and did another wash. She makes a great point to rinse the clothes with the shower head or hose once you drain the wash. You can just spray the water on the clothes in the washer while on drain, and then stop when the water that\u2019s draining has no suds.The spinner works great and also only needs 3 minutes to get most of the wetness out. It does a great job but I\u2019ve had to do a few spinner loads when I do a normal wash size. The spinner is much smaller than the washer, and you don\u2019t want to stuff it with too many clothes. But again, it does the job and is very quick. As a time saver, start the second batch in the spinner while hanging the first batch on your drying rack. as long as this holds up for a while, I would recommend to this who have use for it. Try the shower method if possible so you don\u2019t need to deal with any tubes or faucets. It is light so it\u2019s easy to move in and out of the bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by stating I was once in love with this washer. Raved about it to all my friends and family until recently. The original washer I purchased worked for a some amount of time and them the spin side started to break. It wouldn't dry my clothes at all and made a horrible hissing noise every time I had to use it. So I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement. That replacement arrived and I was able to use it for some time until the washer side COMPLETELY cut up my boyfriends favorite T-shirt. Upset with the washer and now my boyfriend upset with me, I decided to contact the company once again to see what could be done. They were apologetic and sent me a refund and a brand new washer I received about 3 weeks ago. It was working fine until a few days ago. I decided to do a bunch of wash so I filled up the washer with water, detergent and my clothes. Upon turning the knob to turn on the machine I was extremely upset to notice that the wash side on this brand new washer is FUNCTIONLESS! It doesn't spin now! I had to hand ring out the soap and water for my clothes. Needless to say the bathroom was a mess and I had hand wash my clothes because the brand new washer this company sent broke after a few uses. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere. It is what I am going to do for now on !Message to company:I\u2019m very sorry but I think that is very poor service. You sent me a refund, which I\u2019ve used on 2 occasions to purchase 2 brand new washer from your company with the hopes that I would get a washer that actually works and isn\u2019t broken. Also, you mentioned that I should buy a washing machine in my local store. I live in an apartment and can\u2019t purchase my own washer due to living on top of a business that doesn\u2019t allow us to utilize our own washer system. That\u2019s why I stumbled upon your washer with the hopes that it would work for a significant amount of time without having any type of dysfunctions. One \u201cexchanged\u201d washer the spin stopped working and the wash side ripped my boyfriends sentimental T-shirt that he will never be able to replace. The other one you just sent me 3 weeks ago to replace the washer that ripped my boyfriends shirt, the wash side doesn\u2019t even work now? I filled the washer with the water, detergent and clothes to find that the wash side is COMPLETELY functionless. I had to drain and individually squeeze out all the water and detergent from my now drenched clothes and there is nothing you can do ? I\u2019m not asking for a refund, I\u2019m asking for a washer that actually works.Company: \"Hello,Thanks for your message.We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience that brings to you.As for the order, we have refunded full money to your original payment account.Have you received it?If you still need a washing machine, you can buy one in your locals.If you have any questions, please contact us freely.\"",

I was planning to lift the washing machine and put it on my bathtub, but it is heavier than I expected, so I putted the machine on a flat dolly roller with wheels and now I have no problems moving it around. And the little filter box does not seem to work.I like my machine; it does a good job so far.",
