Where do I start.....let me start with the one bad thing I don't think it's the manufacturer fault thou, anyway I think the drain hose is too short but I attached my water hose to my drain hose with the clamp I get in the package so that work for me, I remove the top from my extended shower hose and use it to full my washer. Now for my queen ladies she is a little washer queen, she is very quiet the microwave make more noise, I put like three short sleeve men shirt and three undershirt per wash and that works. She washes very clean , I use all my things I used in a regular washer to do my laundry soap , fabric softener etc. As for the dryer side it drys 90% .

                "reviewText": "OK, talk about an adventure... The first version of this I was sent did not work. However, this company's customer service department was great and after I sent them a video of the issue with a message they sent me a new washer. The re-shipment was just as fast as the original. (Sometimes companies can drag out the process.) All in all their support team was wonderful and has more than made up for the issues I had to start.Now about the product itself. The washer works very well and does everything it claims to do. I love that I can fill with water and allow items to soak before running the wash cycle. Which is wonderful for stained things you want to soak in a pre-treatment setup you prefer. (I cook a lot so I often times will soak things in oxy-clean before washing.)You can fill up the machine in 2 ways.The first being to use the hose that's included. I do not use this method because the hose does not securely connect to any of my sinks. So you have to hold it while it fills up. Which is slow and you might need a glove if you are using very hot water. Also, I wouldn't leave this alone to fill while you do something else. As far as I can tell there is not sensor to shut off the water intake automatic. So it could overflow if you aren't watching. The the fill hose is cheaply made and 4 feet long. So I would go ahead and invest in a better hose right away if you plan to use this for long term. (I did ask their support team about getting a better hose and they did provide me with a link to one they think will work.) The hose also does not connect very securely. Meaning that it can be knocked off pretty easily or split from being connected and disconnected often.The other fill method is to use a bucket and the bathroom tap. Depending on the bucket size this is by far faster.The draining works well and you can flush the machine out by adding water using a bucket while draining. (I do this to ensure that as much used water is out as can before adding clean water for rinsing.)The drying spinner is pretty good, but it is only secured at the base. So, if over fill with heavy items it could start banging around and potentially damage the washer over time. However, it works very well when balanced. (just make sure to have the drain hose setup to drain where you wish.)All in all this isn't a bad portable washer for the price and it's not heavy to pickup at all.Note: I gave a 4 star rating because of the hoses being cheaply made, a bit short and the lack of secure connections options included.",

You can only put a few pieces at a time. But other than that it works perfectly for me.",

It made a buzzing sound and would not spin. Then the washer side wouldn't work. I wouldn't recommend this wash machine. I have to try and start a return and figure out how to get my money back. Not having a car and having to do all this is going to add to the stress. Definitely not worth the money. I followed the instructions on using the wash machine. I didn't over load it. I don't understand how something that cost this much broke so easily.",

I bought this in hopes that it will work as great as it shows in the video. This machine works wonderfully. I wash the laundry for my husband and I every single day with this washer machine. it is small and fits about five pieces of regular clothing. It will fit two pants in one load. It does take a little longer than a large washer, but other than that it is an absolute delight, and it is how I have been washing laundry for over a year. One side is a washer you fill with water the other one is a strainer where you placed the wet clothes in and it removes all the extra water. I also bought a portable dryer so from that rinse I removed them placed them in their dryer and laundry is done. This machine is absolutely worth the price. It comes about knee height and can fit about two jackets at a time. For my family this works perfectly for me and I love it.",
