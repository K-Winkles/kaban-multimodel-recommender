Don\u2019t take too much space which is good for my small apartment. Don\u2019t make too much noise and not hard vibrating. So not bothering my neighbors. And you can put more cloth for one circle of wash then it\u2019s looks. Don\u2019t affect my electric bill. And it\u2019s good bonus . Do I recommend it to my friends already . It\u2019s super good washer for small living spaces . For me it\u2019s work super well and super affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "This washer is absoutly amazing. I live in an apt where laundry is downstairs and with my health issues makes it nearly impossible to safely take laundry down and back up and my partner doesn't have to time to do laundry either due to work. So getting this washer for the apt has been an absolute life saver! It's so easy to use and fits a good amount of clothes! It's easy to hook up and them move back to wear you want to store it when your done with laundry. It's spins the cloths super well so light clothes only take a couple hours where as some heavier stuff take a day or so to dry. Example my jeans only took a day to dry I expected longer than that but I am so happy with this washer. If your looking to get one this is the way to go!",

                "reviewText": "As a perpetually single, 35 year old man with a bad habit of moving all over the country every couple of years, I have never seen a reason to buy a full sized washer. When my trust Magic Chef portable washer have it on me after 4 years, I was looking for a reasonably priced alternative to a full size unit. This one advertised a .2 cu ft lower capacity for a reasonable price, so I thought I would try it out. I am now regretting that decision.The first thing I noticed was the size is significantly smaller. The advertised space is about 90% of my old washer, but I struggle to fit a weeks worth of shirts in it, while I never had a problem with my old machine. I have concerns about what would happen if I tried to put a comforter in this one.The second thing I noticed was the smell. It gives off a very industrial smell whenever I use it. I hope that this will go away in time, and I haven't noticed this small on my clothes, but it makes my laundry room stink whenever I use it.The last big thing I have noticed is the spin cycle is so weak, it is almost useless. I have taken things out, and they are still dripping wet. So wet that I can wring them out with little effort. I was accustomed to my old machine, where things came out very dry. At the end, on that machine, the spin cycle stopped working, and things came out of it only a little wetter then they come out of this one. You can see how much water is left after a normal cycle in the picture. It is a little hard to see, but there is about a a cup of water in the drum on the right. Edit 10/12/2022 I was able to solve this problem by putting the machine on top of a rack. Apparently the water drainage pump is not strong enough to lift the drain water to a standard laundry hookup height, so putting it on the rack has solved that problem. Clothes still come out wetter then I would like, but better. This is a fatal flaw in my opinion, considering I had to spend an additional $80 for a sturdy enough rack on which to put this. I really wish I had spent that extra $80 on a better machine. Dropping a three star rating to a one star.Ultimately, in another year or so I will hopefully be moving overseas for work, so this will do until then. But I will be glad to turn my back on it when that time comes.",
