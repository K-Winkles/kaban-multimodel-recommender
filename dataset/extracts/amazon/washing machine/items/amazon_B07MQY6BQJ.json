Have done about 5-6 loads so far, no problems. I wring my close by hand before and after the spin cycle, don't have to it's just what I choose. Drain hose could be a little longer, but works fine for me. Line dry...my choice again. I am on a limited budget. The price for this was perfect and I have already saved money and gas by not going to the Laundromat.",

                "reviewText": "I will start by saying that I love little washer in the beginning. However after a month I started realizing that there was tiny holds in my clothing, at that time not realizing that it was the machine.I continued using the machine only to realize that the holds were multiplying and that every piece of clothing with elastic in the waist was stretching out e.g. PjsThe third problem is that the lint that my clothing collects just kept getting worse, I had just bought some clothing pieces and all of them were ruin because of lint stuck on the material .When you are washing a full load, first of all the hose with the machine don't work, I had to buy my own which was not a problem. Then what I found out is that while washing the clothes they got tangle up with each other and got stretch out to the limit then made all the holds that I have been talking about.Now i have a small washer I wish I could use , i don't use it anymore, my clothes is ruin because of it.I bought this washer because I suffer with health issues that give me much pain and problem by going and do my laundry in a laundry mat. Now I just regret spending my money on this. In my opinion if you only need to wash 2 piece of clothing once a month then go for it but if you are someone who will buy this washer thinking I have a machine that I can now use daily or weekly, you are buying the wrong machine.",

You can clearly hear it trying, but the inside bottom circle plate that washes back and forth no longer turns. It was certainly not packed at all. Mostly water. I really had high hopes for this devise but it failed only after the second use. Very disappointing.",

Should have splurged on the one with the separate spinner but this little guy does the job good enough as a big washer. Real good investment. I love it. I have definitely recommended this and bragged about it",
