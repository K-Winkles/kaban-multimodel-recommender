Answer: Because split draining baskets are easy to transport and are not deformed by pressure during transportation. Assembled draining baskets are more durable.

                "reviewText": "I had such high hopes for this little machine but they were sadly dashed. First I received an open box and the product didn't have a power cord, so I returned it for a replacement because I really wanted this product. Fast forward to the second product that had all items, but was not great either. The washer came with a washing basket that was not put together and the instructions did not contain any assembly information. I was not even sure what the parts were until I looked online and realized that it was the basket un-assembled. I put everything together but the instructions were not great on using the product either. Finally went to give it a test run and the drain plug did not fit tightly and looked like it might pop out at any moment. Not really what you want happening during the wash cycle. When I was using it the product moved around a lot and water splashed out from the top even with the top on, and I didn't even have the bucket half full. So after all that I have decided hand washing is much easier.",

The assembly was a little difficult because the directions were not that great. But my husband figured it out pretty quick. This little washer actually works good and gets my sons underwear clean. It's a really good price and I like that it folds flat to store.",
