The package came with all parts including the necessary tools for assembly plus a couple of extra screws. (No, I didn't miss putting any in.) It even came with a large mesh pad which could be used as a non-skid surface or for protecting floors and furnishings. The computer is working fine. When assembling, follow the manual and make sure to pay attention to which pedal goes on which side turning in the direction specified both in the manual and on the end of the pedal. It was easy enough to assemble, but one of the screws for one of the base parts didn't want to go all the way in. That doesn't seem to matter at all since the base works well enough anyway.",

Well, wasn't real expensive so I guess that's what you get.

I had such an awful experience that I will avoid this brand forever.The machine arrived beat up and filthy, covered in grease stains from the excessively oiled pedals. Touching it just to assemble it left black oily stains on my fingers. The instructions were two wrinkly pieces of paper stapled together, written poorly, the screws were rusty, the plastic edges looked chewed up.On such a machine, I believe you're meant to lift the display with your fingers to insert a battery behind it to power the computer. This display was glued on, and the only way to access the battery slot was to lift the plastic shell body by disassembling the whole thing. There was no battery in it so it could never have turned on.The display is supposed to face you while you pedal, left pedal goes on the left, right pedal on the right. It had been, however, assembled backwards, the left pedal marked R and right one marked L. The pedal shafts were crooked and would shift back and forth as you pedaled. The fit and finish were so awful it was off by a full centimeter in some places.it looked very cheap for a $50 price range item. I felt like I'd gotten someone's return with how dirty everything looked.Total disappointment to buy this reasonably in advance as a Christmas gift and have it not function whatsoever. Thankfully, we didn't just gift the unopened box and then find out about all the problems, we tested it first, day of receiving it. We could not have gotten a replacement off Amazon in time for Christmas, so we had to buy a different one in person, and it's leagues ahead of this in build quality and design despite being the same price.Just get another one, don't risk this one. Not worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for use after knee replacement. As the other reviews stated, there is a drag while using but disappeared after using for approximately 1 1/2 hours at a steady pace. It doesn\u2019t move around if used on carpet and leaning back some. With that, it\u2019s more like using a recumbent bike which is better for my back and knees. It is fairly quiet and easy to use. I don\u2019t feel that this is perfect for long term use. But the price and convenience for use as at home, temporary therapy you can\u2019t go wrong. Luckily I was able to purchase as an out of box unit so I definitely got my money\u2019s worth.",

                "reviewText": "Updating my review....Decided to disassemble the unit to see where the dog would have been mounted.Found a magnet mounted on the opposite side of the computer pickup. Passing the pickup in front of the magnet generated a count.The flywheel and pedals were assemble backwards (Left was on the Right and viseversa).Removed the flywheel and pedals and reversed it.Computer is now working, but should not have had to do this for a $50 device.Increased the rating to 2 stars from 1 star. As others mentioned, as you try to increase the resistance the unit becomes unstable and rocks a lot.This is probably OK to use to actively move your legs, but not as a resistance device.I did not see any grease as was mentioned in other reviews. The band and flywheel were dry. Adding some grease might make it smoother, but I think this would also remove the resistance.****************Bought this early for my son's birthday.Just assembled it and the computer that tracks time, counts, calories, etc. does not work.The computer lights up, but it does not appear to have any dog to trip the sensor to make the actual counts.Unfortunately, the return window has closed and we are now out the $50 that we spent for this gift.",
