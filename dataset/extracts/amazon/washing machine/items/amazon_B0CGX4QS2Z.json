I\u2019m a 60 year old woman and I carried the machine by myself up 2 flights of stairs to get to my apartment. The spin dry cycle really takes the water out of your clothes so they dry super fast.Irt dies my engineer\u2019s heart good to see such a tough little machine that works so well. Buy it!",

                "reviewText": "This little machine is amazing! Strong motor! Spuns the clothes very dry. Come out clean. Takes more laundry than i expected. Not for blankets. I place in two jeans three tees. Thermal long sleeves and a dew small towels. Handkes it no problem. I use it every day for about a month with no issues so far. It has 10 settings including speed wash, soak etc just like a regular washer. I love it. It is perfect for me. I wouldn\u2019t recommend for families doung alot of laundry daily but for a single person or a couple who dont need a big washer its great. Takes up no space. Easy to hook up and i carried it down to the basement myself. I think out of the box and only weighs about 40 something pounds.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this for the upstairs living area. I didn't have alot of room for a standard large washer like i have downstairs. I needed something small enough to fit in a little nook of a hall thats only 20inches wide. This washer is better than the one downstairs!! It actually cleans my laundry!! I couldn't believe the dirty nasty water draining out when I washed my work clothes the first time, I honestly don't think the washer downstairs has ever cleaned my clothes!!You have options: You can choose your Liters amount. 4L all the way to 8L. I go with 5L or 6L on a normal laundry day. It has settings with several washing cycles to chose from no matter your choice you can change the Liter amount on all of them.It can fit quiet a bit. More than I expected. I don't like to overload it i like knowing my laundry has room to swish around to get clean.For instance a King Size bottom and top sheet will fit and wash nicely on 7L. I preferred them separately on 4L, I sleep with 2 60lb pups who don't exactly shower every day LOL.The drain hose is a good length. They give you specifics on purchasing longer if needed.They however don't give specifics on if you need a longer intake water hose, I do wish the water intake hose was a foot or two longer and it would be nice to have a shut off button on it as well to stop it from leaking water when detached.For me, i dont move the washer to another area, it stays in the nook. So Its either let it hang down to the floor with a towel to catch the water draining out or as I've found is less messy is to just put the hose in the drum to drain.It was difficult to find a faucet to attach it too as I have all upgraded faucets and the attachments wouldn't fit. After some trial and error I ended up getting a split connector for my shower head and attaching a second long shower hose that stays connected in the shower permanently; with the quick connect attachment the washer comes with its easy to plug up and unplug when I'm not using it.It is light weight if you need to move it from room to room. I'm pretty handy so a trip to menards and some creative building techniques of my own I built a stand for it so my small dryer could be mounted above it.OVERALL: I love this washer and i love the fact i can choose the amount of water i want for each load!If you have a small space it just want your own washer and if you want a washer to actually clean your clothes with complete convenience and privacy, BUY THIS! You won't regret it.The video is disgusting, but this is what getting dirt out of your laundry looks like! Full disclosure it was a rainy day and my pups decided to roll around on my bed to dry off after playing in the yard for an hour and this was the result of that!!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little washing machine. It does well for me for about an outfit of clothes, though I did use it successfully in washing a mattress cover. It takes about 15 gallons of water on the \u201ccommon\u201d cycle, so, if, like me, you don\u2019t have it hooked up to a water supply, you\u2019ll have to carry five gallons of water to it to wash and rinse. I use five gallon aquarium jugs for this, and they do get pretty heavy. I haven\u2019t tried the other cycles, but seeing how dirty the rinse water is when it comes out, it looks as if the machine is doing a pretty good job. Very easy to load; I\u2019ve not had it go off balance on me yet. Clothes come out dry enough you can\u2019t wring any water out of them, and, depending on weight, have been taking 3-10 hours to dry on the rack. My only suggestion would be to make the product manual a bit more comprehensive. I\u2019d like to know what all the different cycles do, how many times they rinse, and how much water you can expect to use. The booklet provided leaves a bit to speculation. Overall I would recommend this machine if you are in a small space like I am and want to avoid trips to the laundromat.",
