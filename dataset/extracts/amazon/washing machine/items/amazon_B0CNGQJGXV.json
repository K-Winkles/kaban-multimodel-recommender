We usually process mail and in-mail messages within 24 hours. The protection bracket in the washing machine is damaged. What should I do? The protection bracket in the washing machine does not affect the use of the washing machine. You can tear it down. Its function is to protect the internal parts of the washing machine during transportation. I chose to AA soak, but the washing machine didn't work. What should I do? If immersion is selected, the washing machine will not start working properly until the clothes have been soaked for 15 minutes. Can the washing machine wash clothes in hot water? The washing machine can wash clothes in hot water. But pay attention to the fabric. Some materials will deform and fade if washed in hot water, which will also reduce the effect of laundry detergent. There is abnormal noise in the washing machine. How should I handle it? Please note: If the clothes are not evenly placed, the inner clothes cannot be dried during the drying process and there will be abnormal sound of clothes hitting the washing machine barrel.",

The drain hose should be longer. This is a great little washing machine that can be used when needed, but not for everyday use.",

The seller also sends goods quickly. Because my family employees use the washing machine with us, I don't want the big washing machine at home to wash my baby's clothes, so I bought this washing machine to wash my baby's clothes independently. Facts have proved that, My shopping is very correct. It is clean and hygienic. I don't worry about the baby mixing other bacteria anymore. The quality is very good, easy to install, low noise, clean laundry and good drying effect.",
