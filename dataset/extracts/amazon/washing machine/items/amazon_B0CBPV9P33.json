Quiet except while spinning.Cons: Very louds spin cycle as the drum keep hitting the outer frame of the washer.Draining pump is not very strong as the machine needs to be much higher than the drainage hose , can be circumvent by washing in the bathroom and placing the drainage hose in the bathtub.",
