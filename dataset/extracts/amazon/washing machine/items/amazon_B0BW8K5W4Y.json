How many water level options does this washer have? With 3 water level: L/16L M/23L H/30L. You could adjust the different washing mode through the wash push-button and control the water level via the switch. Will tihs washer work by putting water in manually, or does it have to be hooked up to a spigot? Dear Customer,thanks for your questions. Yes, this portable washer not only allows you to put water in manually, but also can be hooked up to a spigot. Hoping it will help you. Why did Washer add water, but it can't work? It may be 1. If the water is added manually, it may not reach the water level, so it cannot be started normally; 2. If immersion washing is selected, it needs to wait for a while to start normally.",

I have had the washing machine down in the basement of the apartment that broke down multiple times in the past few months. Landlord have tired multiple time to fix it and it would break in a few days. I finally decided to get a portable washing machine to keep in my apartment just in case, this have been a great addition to my apartment.This washing machine have been easy to hookup and it pretty much connect and use. The product is decently sized, I would say for a couple you would be doing 2 loads of laundry in a week. I have been using the original washer in the basement, but my wife have been using this machine to clean our delicates and the baby\u2019s cloths. Depending on the load size, you and do a wash cycle in as low as 20 mins. She and I have been very please by the product, would recommend the product!",

                "reviewText": "I highly recommend this washing machine for the the following reasons: it is easy to use, it gives great results, and it is the absolute perfect size. When I first got this washing machine, I was slightly worried due to the fact that the machines I\u2019ve tried before are slightly puzzling and quite hard to figure out. However, I got pleasantly surprised when I found out how easy it makes each wash seem. It also provides me with extremely satisfactory results. It gets almost every type of stain out, ranging from paints to those from food. This is also the perfect size for most households. It is big enough to store a good amount of clothes in, but it is small enough so it doesn\u2019t interfere with my everyday life. Overall, I believe that this is a great purchase and would definitely do it again.",

                "reviewText": "First when we got the washer the \u201crat plate\u201d does not fit correctly, it does not \u201csnap\u201d into place there are two random screws which the Manuel does not explain what they are there for I thought it was for the rat plate but there\u2019s no where to screw anything in. The drain hose was leaking from the bottom of the machine. Turns out it\u2019s just tightly put on there\u2019s no adhesive or bracket to hold the drain hose in. The inlet hose is TRASH! Does not work correctly it was leaking from both ends even with adding plumbers tape. I had to go to Lowe\u2019s to buy a real washer hose. The inlet hose part is cheaply put on as I tried to take off the hose the washer port moves. Cheaply put together the plastic is real cheap! Side note if the washer has too much moisture on the panel it can cause an electrical fire or cause the machine to completely shut down. Also any real hot water will cause the plastic to melt that\u2019s how cheap and thin the plastic is. I got one half load completed >:/",

It has many files for you to choose to suit your needs every time you wash clothes. A few days ago, I was empty. I personally turned on the machine to wash it. The sound of the machine running was very low, and it was very dry after washing, a good machine, satisfied, thank you \uff01",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I just got this 25lb model for my little family of 2, so you can see the size here next to a standard stove. It\u2019s honestly too big for two people, but I wanted to be able to wash bedding without issue. I got lucky, because the power cord JUST reached the outlet opposite the stove, while the fill hose JUST reached the kitchen faucet. The quick connect has both male and female threads and attaches easily to male flat kitchen faucet threads (but you may need an adapter if your faucet is different). After using Teflon tape (not included!) on all the connections, mine is leak-free and can be left on without babysitting. I have nowhere to drain under 10cm (won\u2019t fit in bathroom), so I\u2019m draining up into my kitchen sink. I\u2019ll update if I run into any problems. I did not install the plastic rat mesh below the machine. I don\u2019t have rats and figured it would just be something else to rattle around. It\u2019s powerful, and clothes are fresh and clean!Four stars for now, because the length of these connections is something like 3 or 4 feet, so I imagine some people would have issues finding a place to run it without extra supplies. The fill hose, drain hose and electrical supply limit you to about 3 feet on each side of the machine, while the manual demands oft-impossible floor-level draining.",
