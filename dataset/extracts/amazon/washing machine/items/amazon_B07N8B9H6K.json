Doesn\u2019t come out hot or anything but you can feel it\u2019s dry, like an air dry cycle on a regular dryer. It does take a long time to dry BUT personally I think it\u2019s worth the convenience. I do laundry at night so in the morning it\u2019s done. The machine does shake a bit during the spin cycle and dry cycle but not the entire time and it was mostly a small vibration, nothing that annoyed me and doing the laundry at bedtime you don\u2019t even notice the vibration",

Just a complete joke of a machine. You\u2019d be better off saving your money and finding a decent laundromat nearby. At least that won\u2019t take half a day to do a single load.",

On 3/3/2020, the machine stopped working properly, giving error code E21. This meant that the machine was no longer draining properly and had to be manually drained of multiple gallons of water. As a new appliance, this was still under warranty. We submitted a claim on 3/4. And were initially offered a service date of 3/18 - two full weeks without the ability to do laundry. After contacting the manufacturer, the appointment was changed to a different appliance repair contractor and moved to 3/13, however, the otherwise offered nothing and felt over a week relegated to going to a laundromat was acceptable after having just paid for a brand new appliance from them. I will never buy from Magic Chef again. An appliance of this price point shouldn't break with less than 2 months of operation. My last washer was an LG and operated wonderfully for 10 years with no issues. I would not suggest purchasing this specific product nor any other product from this brand due to the disregard with which they treat their customers.",

This works on regular 120 volt and does not have a dryer vent. That's why it doesn't work -- drying needs 240 volt and a vent to send the humid air outside. I put a bath mat which was 50% dry (after hanging outside for an hour) in on \"dry only\" mode, and I swear it came out WETTER than when I put it in. Not kidding. I also tried to put the same bath mat on \"spin only\" (NOT \"rinse and spin\") and it also came out wetter in that mode!!! And it never really spun the mat, it just kind of tumbled it back and forth -- clockwise 5 seconds, stop, counter-clockwise 5 seconds, stop, over and over and over for 10 minutes... it never spun faster than maybe 10 rpm when it should be more than 1,000 rpm. This machine is a total joke, don't waste your time.",
