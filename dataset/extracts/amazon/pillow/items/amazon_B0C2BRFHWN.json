Once fully loft, use the pillows as desired. How to Clean The pillows are fade resistant. For best results, clean as below: 1. Wash on a delicate cycle using cold water. 2. Dry by laying flat on a well-ventilated area. 3. Do not bleach and iron. Dry and Refresh For tumble drying, dryer setting matters a lot: 1. Always dry with no or low heat in a delicate cycle. 2. To prevent possible clumping, give your pillows a nice fluff-up after drying. 3. Air drying is recommended.",

I don\u2019t sleep on my back so can\u2019t speak on that, but stomach sleeping is comfortable but less comfortable than side sleeping. They maintain their form too even when folded or laying in same spot repeatedly. Just fluff and they go right back to the big fluffy clouds they are. 100% recommend!!",
