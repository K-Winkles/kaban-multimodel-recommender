She has been using this pillow for a week and reports that it's fantastic. It fits her head and kneck perfectly and gives just the right support. I was also pleasantly surprised that it had almost no odor when first opening it which most do.The pillow appears a little small at first, but it really is exactly the right size and shape to cradle your noggin and support your neck.What makes me happy is that we have been buying specialized ergonomic pillows that cost well over a hundred dollars and can now switch to this. A significant savings, even if we had to buy them more often.",

It has a lot of bounce to it. I sleep pretty hot, so I like that this pillow is cooling. I buy cooling bamboo sheets as well. The one drawback is that iys weird shape does make it look awkward inside a case.",

I had a different pillow for neck support, but lately I've been having really bad headaches that I know are largely because of neck and shoulder tension. I ordered this because of the amazing reviews and they were spot on. This pillow has the perfect cradling of my head so I'm not straining anything in my neck in some weird position. I also love the little \"ledges\" on the edge of the pillow to rest my hands on (I'm a side sleeper). This pillow has been a game-changer, I'm so glad I ordered it!",
