I opened up the pillows andput them in the dryer for half an hour and these things are huge! I broke my patella last month and keep my leg elevated. These pillows are so high and soft they really elevate my knee and keep me comfortable. I have a memory foam/gel pillow to sleep on but these are so great behind my back when I'm sitting up in bed reading - they're really cushy! Just remember if when you take them out of the vacuum packing - just put them in the dryer and the fluff up so nicely!",

Found these and had them in my cart for a little while. I recently got a new mattress so I bought new bedding and decided to buy these pillows. I was so amazed at the tiny package with the pillows inside took them out and they fluffed up nicely. I didn\u2019t review straight away so I could give a fair review. All I can say is I will be ordering more of these because they are so comfy! They don\u2019t hurt my neck but they also support my head. They are so comfy, fluffy and even stay chill/cool. Definitely a great buy for the price and quality.",
