Their exceptional quality and versatility have made them an indispensable addition to my home decor.First and foremost, the plumpness of these inserts is impressive. They provide just the right amount of support, creating a full and inviting appearance for my throw pillows. The high-quality filling ensures they maintain their shape and loft even after extended use, eliminating the need for constant fluffing.The craftsmanship of these inserts is evident in the stitching and construction. The seams are strong and durable, preventing any unraveling or fraying. This level of attention to detail assures me that these inserts are built to last, withstanding daily use without compromising their integrity.Additionally, these inserts are easy to care for. They hold up remarkably well in the wash, and after drying, they bounce back to their original plumpness. This convenience makes maintenance a breeze, ensuring that my throw pillows always look fresh and inviting.In conclusion, these throw pillow inserts have elevated the comfort and appearance of my living space to a whole new level. Their impeccable quality, durability, and versatility make them a standout choice for anyone looking to enhance their home decor.

The ones I purchased were completely flat, and I had to buy another set just to make them work for my pillow. I am extremely disappointed with my purchase and I strongly advise buyers to be careful of how flat they are as fillers for couch pillow covers.\"",

The directions say to give it time for the pillow inserts to fluff up, to plump them with your hands, to dry them in a clothes dryer, or to leave them in the sun and they should fluff up. I tried all those things. They need more stuffing. Disappointing.",
