I got this to help combat that since i stretch my ears and would like to keep my plugs in while during a stretch.the pillow is a soft suede/microfleece like material, idk how to describe it, it's very silky soft. And it's stuffed pretty well and doesn't sag when you lay on it with your full weight. it also has a zipper opening if you want to stuff it with more stuffing to your liking, so you don't have to rip it open and destroy it.the ear hole opening is a very nice universal size I think. it supports your face/head quite well while also providing enough space for your ear to rest through comfortably.",

I just got a few extra piercings and didn't want to sleep upright (I'm always a side sleeper) and went looking for a travel pillow per the piercers recommendation and then found this. After this arrived and I fluffed it out, I did notice that my ear still touched the pillow underneath. Thankfully I already had stuffing in the house to fill it out enough that my ear doesn't touch anything. I'd recommend this but you'll for sure need stuffing too.",

I wouldn\u2019t have gotten a single night sleep for 6+ months without this! I found a flat, squishy regular pillow that it sat upon at a comfortable height, and then also bought a special pillowcase for this type of pillow (Amazon has it). I took it everywhere with me. The unexpected bonus was that now I can fall asleep with TWO headphones in my ears! It also acts to make it comfortable enough to lay on an ear-bud. So, even though my piercings are now healed, I still use it so I can snooze to my sleep podcast. Can\u2019t recommend this enough.",

The pillow isn't perfectly comfortable but, to be fair, I don't suppose any pillow of this type would be. It was way too hard when it arrived, but I removed a lot of the filling to make it softer (as the directions suggested). It is effective in relieving the pressure that was causing pain on my outer ears.",

                "reviewText": "I looked so hard for a decent ear-hole pillow with removable/washable cover in a natural fiber that would breathe and not trap moisture or bacteria against my skin. I was happy to find this one clearly described as having a 100% cotton pillowcase, even though the case isn't well designed and doesn't fully cover the pillow at the hole portion - it should have a zipper around the outer edge of the pillow, not a large opening around the hole part with a stiff lining on the cylinder going through the center from one side. I was excited to receive it today, thinking finally I could stop using my arm for a pillow when lying on my side and hurting my shoulders! But immediately upon opening it, I could tell this velour fabric was not cotton, not even a blend. It's clearly 100% synthetic, made of plastic essentially. There isn't even a content/care tag sewn in, which is against the law for textiles sold in the U.S. Same thing with the inner shell - definitely polyester. I'm so infuriated! I've wasted time waiting for this that could have been spent having an actual cotton or bamboo viscose pillow/pillowcase shipped. The false advertising on fabric content needs to stop!! It's illegal! Just be honest about what you're selling and you'll have fewer angry cheated customers!",
