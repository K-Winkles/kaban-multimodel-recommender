                "reviewText": "The shape of this pillow has truly improved my sleep. I'm mostly a side sleeper, and occasionally back. Two things about this pillow made sleeping much more comfortable:1) Neck gap is supported. I used to always need to put my arms under my pillow to feel supported enough. This was extremely uncomfortable. I'd wake up with my arms numb and my neck hurting anyway. Now, I never feel like I have to support the pillow with my arms.2) Perfect height. Using this pillow makes me realize that most pillows are wayyy too high. I think it's related to the issue above, where we feel like we need taller pillows (or multiple ones) so that our neck is supported. Really, you just need the right support. This pillow gives me that and my spine and neck feel properly aligned. I actually notice that I wake up with much less stiffness than before, and don't have \"cracks\" when moving my neck and back after waking up like I did before.I feel like I've been wandering for a great pillow most of my adult life, and I think this is it. For this price, it's absolutely, 100% worth it. A couple things to keep in mind:- The pillow is not cooling. It's memory foam, which can never be cooling. It can feel cool when you first lay on it (like a lot of pillows), but it will absorb your body heat to a degree.- As noted in the post, each side is a different firmness, which is noticeable when you lay on it. It seems to have maintained its firmness so far after a couple of months, but this is something I'll keep an eye on.",

                "reviewText": "I've been having some neck and shoulder pain when I get up in the morning and admittedly so I have really bad sleep posture. I'm a side sleeper but I tend to scrunch my shoulder up to my neck and I'm just a mess so that seems to be catching up to me. I tried a different side sleeper pillow before this and it just wasn't working. I heard about square/cube pillows which I thought would be better for my neck and this one had great reviews and an acceptable price. A few things I noticed right off the bat was the quality which was better than I was expecting. It was compressed in the box and after opening the film on the outside it went to it's normal size pretty quickly though I gave it some time to fully decompress. It didn't have any strong/weird smell and the cover seems to be made well and nice and soft. One side was soft and the other more firm which was true to how it's advertised. I prefer the firmer side but sometimes I do switch it up in the middle of the night. I find it to be fairly cooling, doesn't run hot at all. For the final and most important comment it does help me with my neck and shoulder pain. I'm not fully cured just yet :) but it has definitely made an improvement. I'd recommend it to anyone needing that support and proper alignment of your neck and anyone having shoulder pain from side sleeping to give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "This pillow is nice for side sleeping. I only wish I had gotten the 5 inch instead of the 4 inch, it isn't quite as tall as I'd like. I feel like my head isnt fully supported hy the height and my neck kinda bends slightly. And you really are not able to use another pillow on top of this one, as it will slip and slide all over the place for some reason. For reference, I am a 5 foot 4 and 215lbs woman. One side is definitely more firm than the other, which is nice, I prefer the firmer side. I would recommend this, but I would probably err on the side of getting the 5inch height if you're on the fence.",

                "reviewText": "If you're a side sleeper, this is your pillow. Especially if you don't want to pay way more than $100 for other nationally advertised brands. I didn't even know cube pillows existed until I saw the nationally advertised one in an ad. But, I balked at buying one when I saw the pillow was almost $140.$100+ dollars for a pillow? Come on!So, I searched around and found this one on Amazon. I purchased this several months ago, and it is still in great shape and holding strong. It provides great support for my head without having to constantly reposition the pillow under my head. You side sleepers will know what I'm talking about.The only downsides I see are it's not a \"Cool\" pillow. At least for me. And, your regular pillow cases aren't going to fit it well. They slide off as you sleep. But, I'm not concerned about that at all.Bottom line: buy this pillow.",

Once you remove the pillow from the packageing it retakes its original shape relatively quickly. The instructions say to let the pillow re-form for 48 hours. After 48 hours, I began using my pillows. They provide cool comfort and support. If you're looking for a pillow that will help align your spine as you sleep on your side, this pillow should be considered. It's firm enough to offer support, but soft enough to be comfortable. It is very comfortable if you're a back sleeper as well. It comes in a 4, 5, or 6\" thickness. Choose the thickness based on the measurement from your neck to shoulder, if youre a side sleeper. Sleep Well!",
