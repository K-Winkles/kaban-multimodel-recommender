                "reviewText": "Pillows are each shipped in smallest volume attainable: Flattened and tightly compressed pillow in a sealed plastic bag, rolled up. The moment you cut away the plastic bag and air can get in, the pillow immediately swells into a normal, fully puffed-up size and stays that way. No wrinkles, no bends, no deformities, no evidence whatsoever remains that it was ever flattened and rolled up into a tight container for shipping.The pillow slowly squeezes out air when pressed (e.g., by your head when resting on it) and sucks the air back in fully upon removing the pressure from the pillow. Could this \"breathing\" effect be why the pillows don't get unevenly warm with body heat? The pillows stay lukewarm (they don't get hot) against your body in warmer temperatures. In colder temperatures, the pillow is cool at first but quickly gets to that lukewarm temperature. Therefore, I have not found myself sweating or feeling too cold against this pillow.The pillow is very soft at first when pressed down, and it gets somewhat firmer the deeper into the pillow you press. It allows me to rest my head comfortably, whether lying on my back or on my side. When I raise up away from the pillow, the pillow quickly returns to its full shape. The shape of the pillow conforms to the shape of my head, arms and legs -- my head senses the pillow's comfortable firmness directly underneath, surrounded gently around all sides.This pillow holds the pillowcases on so that they don't slide off or bunch up while sleeping. The pillow itself is much lighter than it looks. No hissing sound, no sound at all as air slowly seeps into or out of the pillow.I bought six pillows blindly (I saw good reviews but was otherwise unfamiliar with what exactly I could expect). I am so very pleased with these pillows. Zero allergic reactions and no odor. Good temperature. I am glad I decided on these and didn't wait any longer to purchase them. I have slept comfortably with these pillows; I enjoy using five pillows at a time all around my body when I am sleeping. No creases, crevices or lumps. I am very pleased with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "These are incredibly soft, so soft and comfortable that I thought about taking a star away - my cat no longer wants to sleep on me, but against these pillows. Like how dare she. I have lost my cuddle buddy. All day she's on them. And all night...I bought new pillows after a friend informed me that after like 2 years, 10% of your pillow weight is dust mites. So I immediately bought these ones because they were cheap and had good reviews, and I don't need much in a pillow.I like pillows that are very thin to even no pillow. These are pretty thick, but soft enough that it squishes so doesn't feel overly thick. It still is slightly too thick for me though, but a little wear should fix that. If you like super thick and firm pillows like I used to (I went from super thick pillows to no pillow so idk what is up with me anymore), then these pillows are not for you. If you can't sleep with a pillow, these pillows are not for you. But if you want these pillows to cuddle your head and your cat, then buy them. I don't want to do anything besides lay on these pillows anymore.They are longer than a standard pillow (obviously, cuz they're queen pillows and apparently that's a thing), so they properly fit in some of my pillowcases now, but my other set I just doubled up the cases so no pillow was exposed.They do come vacuum packed and then in a zipper bag, so are difficult to get out, but I held on to one of the pillows and swung the bag around violently and they came out. It was quite therapeutic.",
