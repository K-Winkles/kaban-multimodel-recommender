These came quickly, washed up well and seem to be good after a repeat wash. My other covers did not require laundering but since I do my sheets weekly it\u2019s not a big deal to wash these too. I\u2019ll keep them on until the humidity rises come June then likely use the remaining medical grade cover for 8 weeks in summer. These allow for a fluffier fit with the same pillow.",

I had ordered the medium Queen size pillows as the first ones I ordered were in firm, Standard sized. I ordered these protectors in Standard/Queen which fit the standard sized pillows perfectly but they keep the Queen medium pillow too firm as it can't spread out enough in this case so I have now ordered the protectors in a larger size for the Queen pillows. Great protectors wash well in hot water and it's reassuring to know that any and all allergens are absent from the pillows and pillow protectors!",
