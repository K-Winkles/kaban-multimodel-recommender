                "reviewText": "If you want a firm but very comfortable pillow that supports your neck while you sleep, this pillow is it. I have struggled to find a pillow that would work for me, because I don't like a big fluffy pillow that jacks my neck up, and flatter pillows were too flat with no support at all. This pillow is just right. It comes shrinked down and packaged in a plastic bag, but it plumps right up when opened. The cover will also unzip to be removed and cleaned. All around great product!",
