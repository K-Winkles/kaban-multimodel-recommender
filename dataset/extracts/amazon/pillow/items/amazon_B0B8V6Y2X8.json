                "reviewText": "Believe it or not, I didn't buy this travel pillow to travel (I rarely get on planes these days). I bought it for my very frequent lunch naps. I work long hours at a desk in a stressful shop so these cat naps are what helps me reset and perform at my best. I open the shop early and often stay late so there's a lot of time where my eyes need a rest but the back of my chair isn't comfortable AT ALL and I often wake up with a very stiff neck and muscle soreness. I decided to invest in myself and get this adorable travel pillow. The memory foam is wonderfully soft and spongey, the dark black color is rich and doesn't stain easily, and the fit around my neck is snug and extraordinarily comfortable. Right out of the bag it had that weird plastic smell but that went away after a few days. I look forward to my office naps even more now! As a bonus, now I have a very comfy pillow that I can take with me if I ever need to travel by plane. I guarantee this one is way more comfy than the expensive cheaply made ones inside the airport!",

I bought it to support my head after eye surgery to keep me from turning my head and sleeping on side of surgery. It is very uncomfortable for sleeping in bed regardless of which way I placed the snap opening. It is more comfortable wearing in a sitting position which makes it better for travel.",
