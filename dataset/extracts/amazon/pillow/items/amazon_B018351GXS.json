I went to order another pillow form Perfect Cloud but they were sold out / unavailable.So, I went online did a quick google and found this product was recommended.I would not recommend this pillow. It is very disappointing. I prefer a memory foam pillow to be a solid piece of memory foam. This product, in contrast, is a bag of shredded memory foam. The pieces are so irregular in shape that it is very noticeable and is very uncomfortable.If you are looking for shredded memory foams chunks stuffed into a bag... well then you are in luck. If not, go with another brand.",
