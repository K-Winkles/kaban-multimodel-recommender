However, I absolutely love them so far. First night I got them I slept really well, in fact I overslept\u2026 which never happens. Fluffy not lumpy and I can squish them to get my head & neck just right. First time in years I have finally found the perfect pillows. I really only need one, but two is gold. One for each side of the bed. I was gonna do a video review, but it\u2019s really not necessary. It\u2019s a pillow lolThank you for not ripping me off. I will definitely spread the word. 5 stars",
