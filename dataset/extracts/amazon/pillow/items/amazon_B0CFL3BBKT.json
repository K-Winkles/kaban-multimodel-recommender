                "reviewText": "Absolutely love them they aren\u2019t so rough yet not super soft but they are a great fabric that the color is true to image description. Great cases that are made well and very strong. I have a small cavapoo and he loves scratching blankets and pillows to get comfortable on them on the couch and he didn\u2019t do any damage to these cases. Highly recommend for a pop of color.EDIT:I\u2019ve had these covers for 4 months now and one is starting to come apart at the seam by the zipper. Very upset because I really liked these covers. It\u2019s something that can be fixed but when you buy covers you expect them to last. I only washed it twice on gentle cycle and let it air dry. It could just be one pillow case was made differently and wasn\u2019t put together like others. I do only have one messing up not both. I am taking 1 star away for that even though it could be an error but it\u2019s just a possibility that you may run into this problem.",

I really like them! They give a pop of color to my neutral colored couch, and they are simple and basic to complement my other pillows that have more bold designs. They are the perfect accent pillow! They are also really great quality, and I had no issues zipping them up. Since I plan to take these on and off just for the holidays, it\u2019s important to me that the zipper is good quality. These were a great buy!",

The color seems slightly muted, and the texture is neither soft nor rough. The zipper isn't the best quality, so I close them gently, but they do stay shut when zipped. Overall I like them as a basic pillow cover.",
