I\u2019ve tried actual knee pillows and i need closer to 4 inches or more between my knees to not be in pain. Nothing has worked and then i came across this and thought why not as its time for a new pillow anyways. First off i never checked the dimensions on the body pillow and was shocked to receive a pillow nearly as long as my king size bed. I love that i can adjust how firm this pillow is and than it has a cooling top. After a week of using this pillow i absolutely love it. If you have severe injuries that result in life long discomfort this is the pillow for you! I have dislocated knee caps and little cartilage left in my knees, a twisted pelvis and lots of crushed and bulging disks in my back. This pillow has kept me in one place all night and not tossing and turning all night causing my to wake up hurting worse that when i went to bed. Finally wake up feeling refreshed and not in pain. Definitely worth a try for the price!",

                "reviewText": "If you like a nice firm pillow this is the one to buy. The pillows are rolled and compressed for shipping. Once you remove them from the packaging they start to fill out. You can expedite the process by stretching the contents from the center to the edges. If you feel the pillows are too firm you can easily remove as much of the filling as necessary to achieve your desired firmness. The cover is beautifully designed. It is easy to remove and wash as needed. Highly recommended.",

Well packaged and shipped relatively quickly but the gamble was on the ability to maintain firmness over night. They are very comfortable for about 45 minutes to an hour and then I flop and flip and puff and fluff the pillow. Not the best but not as bad as my old pillows. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I just want some decent sleep.",

Came with a cooling pillow case, amazing.",
