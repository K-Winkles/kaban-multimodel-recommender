I have a history of neck issues and this provides comfort and support with softness, don't know how that is possible. It has a cool side and a warmer side, so no more temperature issues while I sleep. Treat yourself !",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item thinking it was a \"Cooling\" type pillow as stated in the item description. This pillow feels cool to the touch, but soon as you rest your head on it after 30 seconds to a minute you begin to feel warm. I do not think it \"cools\" anything in my opinion. The pillow I replaced this with (Mr Pillow) had no such \"cooling\" label and my head didn't get as warm with that pillow as I do with this one. The pillow overall is nice. It has good weight to it and it is comfortable initially. Till your your head gets warm. Maybe in colder climates this pillow would be ideal? Living in a hot climate I just see no cooling affect after 30 seconds of use. I have been using the pillow now for a week or 2. Its not the worst pillow I have ever bought, but not the best one either. For the price? Its worth trying to see if it suits you.",
