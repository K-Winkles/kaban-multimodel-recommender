I was hesitant when ordering as the pillows looked to tall but I figured if they did not work for both my husband and myself, at least they would work for him. I was pleasantly surprised. I have gotten a full night's sleep for the first time in quite a long time! Ordering another set today as replacements for when these might need replacing. I highly recommend them!",
