I opened them and left them out for a week, not sure if they off-gas or anything like that as a result. I threw them in pillow cases and slept with them - no smell. Very comfortable. They are THICK, though, I am a stomach sleeper and find them great to smash my head into and drift off into nothingness with. My wife, however, sleeps on her back and finds them thick. I'd imagine they'll calm down a little bit but - a pillow that's too fluffy - that's a good problem to have.All-in-all, a great buy. They remind me of the pillows you find in hotels.",

Great product, just not great for me.Recommend to the right sleeper!",
