Sleeping on satin (or silk) pillowcases is a must for keeping curly hair looking good. These pillowcases are soft, wash well, and seem to hold up over time. I like that they zip on so they stay secure through the night. I don't get too hot sleeping on them either, which is a great quality. Overall, I'm happy with these and look forward to buying a few more.",

I washed my other one 1-2 times a week for over a year and it still looks new. They are silky soft and cool to the touch. They also zip around your pillow which keeps it nice and secure. The zipper is excellent quality. I decided to buy this pillowcase because it\u2019s supposed to be gentle on you skin and hair. It is! My hair looks pretty much like it did before I went to sleep, and I don\u2019t have \u2018sleep\u2019 marks on my face when I get up. You will be glad you bought this.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very impressed with the quality of satin hair products I\u2019ve purchased from Kitsch in recent months, including this pillowcase! I bought it for 11% off but I\u2019d easily pay full price. I also purchased the satin hair scrunchies months ago and they\u2019re top quality. I recently gave them as gifts to girlfriends too\u2014we all love them!In the past I splurged on Blissy sets \u2014 silk pillowcases, hair scrunchies, and eye masks. I bought full sets for myself and 3 best friends. My set was all wrong. Incorrect colour and missing some extras I bought. I purchased pink and received white. I contacted customer service. They said they don\u2019t accept returns or exchanges and there\u2019s nothing they could do! And I never received my missing items after weeks of emails and showing I had spent over $500 on the purchase order with all those gifts. I was furious. Still, I hoped the silk pillowcase would be as incredible as they advertised it. I used it for a few months. The white was very challenging to clean and I got so frustrated, I threw everything out. Costly and unfair mistake.Then I purchased a pillowcase made of mulberry on Amazon for $40. It wasn\u2019t nearly as soft and silky as the Blissy, but it was decent and lasted much, much longer.I was skeptical to try satin; but, my experiences with other Kitsch products including the satin scrunchies convinced me to give this one a try. For less than $26, I\u2019m extremely impressed with the softness, durability, and style of this pillowcase! Highly recommend it!I\u2019ll update this review in a few months and let you know whether I buy more for a complete bedroom set, or, if anything changes with respect to my satisfaction. So far, this is the best pillowcase and wonderful next-day delivery experience of all my attempts to buy a quality product to help protect my skin and hair.",
