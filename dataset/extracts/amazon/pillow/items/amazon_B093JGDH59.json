                "reviewText": "Pillow protectors are really important for your investment in good quality pillows. Wetness from sleep can easily seep through a pillowcase and leech into the cotton fabric casing of your pillow, making it stained or yellowing the overall color over time. Considering that a really good goose down feather pillow can go between $70 and $140 on average, spending $10~$20 on a very good pillow protector is just smart thinking.I've gone through about two dozen pillow protectors over the years. What usually happens is that the fabric isn't as resilient as expected and will end up yellowing over time. I often forget to launder mine, remembering once every few washes. In some cases, the protector will reach a point where it's not providing enough of a barrier and allow staining moisture to sneak past. Or, the zipper ends up breaking.I finally decided that buying cheap pillow protectors to throw away every couple of years is just not smart. This time I invested more. This pillow protector set by National Allergy was on sale, so I got two for $13.50.The first thing I noticed is that the fabric is a bit stiff. But this is something that softens up over time, thankfully. It does have a cotton-like shell that feels like good quality. On the flipside, there's a treatment of some kind that feels like it's water repellent, without being a sort of all plastic 100% waterproof barrier. It does breathe. The zipper is not along the edge, but instead about an inch back from the edge on one side, which is a smart design--reduces stress on the zipper teeth.One thing that kind of surprised me. This is a queen size, but it appears to be 20\" by 31\". I happen to have a \"short queen\" that's in between standard and usual queen, coming in at 28\" long. So, I end up with 3\" extra material. It's not a huge deal, because I fold that over and push that through the pillow case first. The fold stays, it lays flat, and the pillow feels fine. Because it takes a good long while of use to figure out if a pillow protector is going to hold up, I'll have to come back at a later point to follow up.",

It will be holding goose down.I almost rated it less but only because of the way it was shipped not because of the product. Instead of taking a minute and putting it in a shipping or mailing bag they just put the label in the product packaging. The zipper was open and it looked as if someone had stuffed the contents back in. Unacceptable.. pure laziness.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These are nice very crisp and cool cotton pillow protectors. They are a little on the bigger side making it very easy to slip my fluffy queen size down feather pillow inside but I would have preferred them to fit a little better. I know they were an in bigger in length and width but I thought they would shrink a bit but they didn't. I washed them in hot water and dried them on medium heat and they came out great but still just a bit too big. Once inside the pillow cases they don't look bad though as you can see in the photo. I do kinda wish I had tried the standard size but I was worried they would be too small.Because they are such a crisp cotton they do make a little noise when you shake them (see video) but once it's on your pillow with a pillow case you don't really notice it. They do seem like they will protect pillows well since they are such a tight crisp cotton. Since my down feather pillows are so expensive and I don't like waterproof protectors on down pillows I usually use 3 protectors on each pillow for extra protection. Two of these together on a pillow seem like they would really help protect my pillows especially with an additional cotton pillow protector under these. I know, I know it seems excessive.....I just like clean pillows. LolOverall these are fantastic pillow protectors that are the perfect thickness and feel very durable and like they'll last a long time. All 3 zippers on the protectors are smooth and feel durable. I don't think they are water resistant so I'm not sure why it asks about that....Reviews are important to me because I rely so heavily on them when making purchases. So I try to leave thorough reviews for other customers. I hope this review was helpful.",

                "reviewText": "Overall these pillow protectors are ample in size and of good quality. However one of mine arrived with a minor flaw, that was frustrating at first because the zipper wouldn't slide open--the stitching was too close to the zipper slide. I had to rip out about 6 of the machine stitches in order to open the zipper. I then moved the edge of the material back a bit and re-stitch the zipper back in place. So if you're not handy with a needle and thread this might be a problem.",

I wanted 100% cotton and I am so pleased with the quality of these protectors. Yes, they are wrinkled after coming out of the dryer, even when removed damp, but I expect that of 100% cotton. A quick steam or iron and they were perfect for putting on my pillows. Skip the rest and buy the best.",

The fit well and keep bugs from getting into the pillow as well as trapping existing bugs inside -- either way, you aren't bothered by them. The pillow cases are sewn together for an inch or two where the zipper ends so the zipper itself is also sealed. A bit expensive, but perfect in every respect.",
