The removable cover is a practical touch for easy maintenance. Although the odd shape limits pillowcase options, I found a workaround by wearing a bonnet during sleep, making it a small trade-off for a personalized sleeping experience. I do like the notches where your arms can rest and the fact that the lifted area on one side prevents me from sleeping with half my face mashed down into the pillow.

It\u2019s a very good quality foam, giving in to the weight of the head just enough with a super comfortable feel.But I don\u2019t find the odd shape of the pillow to be comfortable for using beneath my head as demonstrated. If I lay on the pillow like the woman in the ad, I find there is not enough height up from the mattress. There is also a kind of awkward space between my lower neck and shoulders\u2026 as though I need a little more pillow to extend to at least the top edges of my shoulders. Because of the weird shape, there are no other good ways to sleep with my head on it.I do find if I prop one side of it length wise against my back, it is great support while using one of my other pretty good pillows for my head.I would\u2019ve loved this pillow in a more standard pillow shape!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my boyfriend who is mostly a side sleeper, but also sleeps on his back some, so I thought a versatile pillow like this could be helpful. He seems to find the design a bit confusing, but overall he likes the pillow. We did notice a bit of that new memory foam smell at first, but it went away fairly quickly. Additionally, it firmed up and expanded fairly quickly too within a handful of hours after removing it from the packaging, and provides pretty good neck support. However, it's not as comfortable for sleeping on your back as the listing makes it seem. I feel like on the side it's okay, but seems to high/tall for back sleepers, so I don't think it's as versatile as it seems. The flap things on the side are a bit odd and go unused by my household. It does seem to stay pretty cool and not overheat you. Overall we like this pillow and it's comfortable for side sleeping, but the design isn't perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this pillow. It's not as firm as some of the memory foam contoured pillows out there but it's firm enough to support my head and neck well. Wife reports much less snoring from me - more of that even deep breathing. I don't wake up with sore shoulders anymore either. I sleep both on my back and my side, and it works equally well. You can even turn the pillow around and use either side for support. Solid bet if you're a snoring side and back sleeper!",
