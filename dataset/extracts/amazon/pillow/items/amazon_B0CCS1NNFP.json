Well once I received the pillows, both my wife and I felt they were over-stuffed. Our 1st night was pretty rough, so the next night we remove roughly 50% of the stuffing and now it feels great to sleep on.",

They do come super stuffed and you can add or remove fluff as needed. I read the other reviews saying they were provided with extra stuffing mine did not come with the extra but they have plenty of it in the pillows already. I would buy them again. Now just waiting to see how they hold up over time!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars SUPER FIRM, but can be adjusted ...",
                "reviewText": "Everything was VERY well packaged. The way these were packaged was a bit different than any other vacuum sealed packaging items I've received. Each pillow was vacuumed sealed in a heavy duty plastic and rolled tightly in that same plastic. The box felt hefty, so much so, that when I opened it, I did weigh the rolled up pillows. They each weighed just over 3 lbs. Also in the box were two packages of extra \"fluff,\" in case you wanted to customize the firmness. After opening, and unrolling the pillows, I could see that they each have a zippered pillow case and another zippered case that contains the \"fluff.\" There were no specific instructions, so I threw the outer pillow cases in the wash and the inner \"fluff\" within it's case, in the dryer for approximately 15 minutes. The pillows came out of the dryer super fluffed up and they are, very much, memory foam. Initially, because of the appearance of the fluff, I wasn't convinced that the pillow was going to, actually, perform like a memory foam, but it does. For any who might be wondering, there was no chemical odor. There was a very slight scent of something, but it wasn't off putting or like chemicals. For lack of a better word, it was sort of like fabric, or maybe a scent from the manufacturing facility. I did not find it offensive, at all, and only very slight (I have an incredibly sensitive nose). The outer pillow cases washed/dried beautifully. As far as sleeping on them, I would call them SUPER firm, just as they are. I cannot imagine anyone wanting a firmer pillow. In fact, I will be removing some of the fluff, as I prefer firm, just not THIS firm. I think it's really good that they include extra fluff. Maybe with time, it will be needed. Worth mentioning that getting the pillow into the pillow case, once washed, was not too difficult. As can be seen on the Amazon site, there are kind of points on one side of the pillow, so a little work is required to get everything right. I think they're really nice pillows and the \"push back\" of the memory foam is just right ... just a little too much is stuffed in the pillow, though, for my preference.",
