                "reviewText": "The MOLCLCUY Memory Foam Pillows were nearly perfect for me, and here's why:1) The price was excellent, especially considering a pack of two queen-size pillows was priced at just US$21.90 at the time of this review.2) The pillows were dense and puffy, providing great support.3) They were comfortable to sleep on.4) The memory foam chunks inside allowed for easy adjustment. Whether I needed to decrease thickness or firmness, I could remove or add chunks accordingly, making them highly customizable.However, a couple of drawbacks prevented them from being perfect:1) Upon arrival, there was a strong acetone or chemical smell. Despite airing them out for several days, the smell lingered. I think that spraying some fragrance might help.2) According to a Google search, the pillows should be hand-washed instead of machine-washed, which adds a bit of inconvenience to maintenance.Overall, despite these minor issues, the MOLCLCUY Memory Foam Pillows offer great value and comfort. I still like sleeping on them.",

After the first night of sleeping, I decided mine was a bit too thick for me, so I removed some of the stuffing -- there is a zipper on the end, so I didn't even have to remove the pillowcase. I was able to easily pull some of the stuffing out and put it in a ziplock bag in case I wanted to add some back in later, and it was easy to manage without making a mess. Then I zipped it up and squished it around a bit to redistribute the stuffing, and you couldn't even tell that I had removed stuffing, other than the fact that it was not so thick. I love that I can have a pillow that's exactly the right thickness for me! It's quite comfortable now. I also like that they're machine wash & dry. I would definitely recommend!",

They arrived vacuum-sealed and wrapped in plastic; they quickly inflated to proper size within a few minutes. These are plump pillows; I could barely fit them into the standard pillow cases. But they look great on the bed - full and soft. They are so comfortable to lay on as well.The genius part is that the pillow is zippered, allowing you to remove some of the stuffing, if necessary. So if the pillow is too plump for you, you can remove some of the stuffing until the filling is to your preference.The pillows did come with a strong chemical smell upon opening (and I have the worst sense of smell). I've been allowing them to off-gas and, after a day, the smell is less intense.",

                "reviewText": "I hoard pillows, soft but squishy pillows. I love having basically a nest, it's ridiculous. I've had pricey pillows to super cheap pillows, firm pillows and fluffy pillows--all which fall flat over a too short amount of time. Honestly, time will tell with these, though. BUT as a side sleeper, these are squishy YET supportive, and I love them so much! So many \"supportive\" pillows are all fluff and no support once you lay head to pillow, and these were did not. For the price (at this time), I'm definitely willing to buy new ones should these fatigue anytime soon, that's how comfortable they are to me. The ONLY drawback I can speak of, is the smell. But it's no surprise since it's a memory foam and vacuum sealed product, definitely give it a few days to air. I'm probably going to stock up.",

                "reviewText": "I am amazed at how these pillows are vacuum packaged. My first photo shows one pillow still in the sealed package along with the pillow that it becomes. Brilliant. As you can see in my second photo, they are vacuum sealed and shipped together in the same box. The pillows are very well constructed and sewn beautifully. There are no flaws in the workmanship at all. They are on the heavy side, but not too heavy to move around in my bed. I use 2 pillows for sleeping, one for my head and the other to place between my knees to align my back. These work very well for me. This pillow stabilizes my head really well when I use them, and I feel like it holds my head and neck in a comfortable position. I had a very restful night's sleep using these pillows. You get 2 pillows in this order, so it is a terrific value! I highly recommend these quality pillows.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned a number of Memory Foam pillows in the last couple of decades, but this may be my favorite, so far. Despite the shredded Memory Foam, the pillow seems to hold its shape very well. Similar products have let me down in the past by eventually turning into formless lumps whose only structural integrity is gained from a tight pillowcase. The MOLCLCUY Memory Foam Pillow holds its shape rather well. ANd it's incredibly comfortable, of course. The packaging was really nice, as well. I was honestly taken aback by how small and heavy the box was, though. They really pack these things densely.",

                "reviewText": "I'll start this review by saying that I'm a bit of a pillow snob. My husband can attest to the fact that we have way too many pillows in the house. This two-pack of pillows came tightly vacuum packed and they took about an hour to fluff up fully. They had a horrible chemical smell and it did wear off a fair amount after a day, but a week in and I can still smell the faint chemical smell through the double pillow case, and that is why I knocked a star on this. I only hope the smell will eventually disappear completely because these pillows are AMAZING for their comfort level. I shift a lot in my sleep from side to back to stomach, and I'm always annoyed when there isn't enough shoulder support on my side and I have to shove more of the pillow between my neck and shoulder. There isn't that problem with these pillows, it is the perfect level of support and it shapes to what you need without being too firm or too soft, just amazing! It might be a little too lofty if you are a 100 percent stomach sleeper though. I found the pillows to be a few millimeters longer than standard queen size, so if you're using a zippered case, it will plump the pillow a little higher than normal.",
