They washed just fine and after a few minutes in the dryer they were ready to go! I will buy more of these in different colors and I\u2019m STILL astounded by the great value\u2026 !",

                "reviewText": "I just wanted to have 4 pillowcases that were the same color for the guest bed--these filled the bill. However, while they washed up fine, they have no stretch so the pillow must fit it or be smaller (standard size pretty flat); they do not come out of the dryer unwrinkled & will need to have an iron run over them. Also, they are so soft & thin that they look like something we have had around for years having little shape (no stiffness to speak of--so not great for a pick-me-up sharp look in the guest room). I do like the embroidered hems & the rich dark brown color (coffee I'd say). So, while I will not be a repeat customer, these work for what I need today & the price point was right on for this 'quality' of product.",
