But when I tried to use it while wearing my mask it really didn't work very well -- I had to move my head so far to the edge to get to the space that it was no longer comfortable. My head isn't small, but it really seems like it's built for a larger person or for a back sleeper.",

It securely wrapped around his head and had a great neck support. It didn't have a strong smell and quickly regained its shape. It looked stylish and came with a sponge cushion to adjust the height. The quality was exceptional, giving my husband perfect sleep posture. I might get another one for my father on Father's Day.",
