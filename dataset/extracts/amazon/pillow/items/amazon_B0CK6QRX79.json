My pain isn't miraculously gone, but I can tell that over time it's going to get better and better. After only 2 nights of sleeping on the pillow, I got better sleep, felt more comfortable, and noticed less neck pain than usual.I love that it is SO soft and honestly the exact perfect height for me. I sleep on my side/stomach and this pillow is working perfectly for those positions.",

                "reviewText": "Recently got this pillow because i realized my sleeping habits werent getting me a great sleep so I wanted a pillow with more support. I want to say this pillow is super ideal with me, not only do I not roll around as much during the night, my head stays in the same position and is well supported in all positions, but I'm mostly a back/ side sleeper. On the side, my head gets great comfort as it properly distances my shoulders and my face and gives it a very comfortable shelf. I also find the material to be adquate. This isn't a cooling foam, its fairly simply memory foam, and youre head will sink into it, as long as your room is adquately heated or cooled, you shouldn't run into a problem with the foam. And despite its weird shape it fits well within a pillow case so that's a huge plus. I've had so many better nights of sleep with this product than I have had with a pillow like tempurpedic tempu ergo, although, i wouldn't be surprised if they came out with a similar product soon.",

My son\u2019s friend came to stay with us and said this is the most comfortable pillow he\u2019s slept on. It is pretty well flat when it comes but plumps up to a very thick pillow. It\u2019s affordable and also helps with neck shoulder and back pain. Great value",

Read all the good reviews and decided to get this. Took a day to air and grow expand the foam out. It's very soft and the height is just right. After that there was no \"smell\". Took me about 2 days to get use to this new pillow and I do like the curvature and shape of it. Now I can't say for sure it's a miracle but after a week of sleeping on this I don't feel any neck or back/shoulder pain and I feel like i slept really , really good, maybe even better than before. Oh, they offer a 100 day sleep trail and a 5 yr warranty so give it a try, there's nothing to lose!",
