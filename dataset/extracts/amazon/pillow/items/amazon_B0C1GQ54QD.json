                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this cervical pillow on a friend's recommendation, and it has completely transformed my sleep experience. The memory foam construction provides excellent support to the neck and shoulders, promoting a natural and comfortable alignment throughout the night.It cradles the neck gently, easing tension and allowing for a more restful sleep. What I appreciate most is the adaptability of the pillow \u2013 it's not too firm, not too soft, but just right for a personalized sleep haven.The breathable cover adds an extra layer of comfort, and the overall quality is top-notch. I've noticed a significant improvement in my sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed.This purchase has been a game-changer for my sleep routine, and I couldn't be happier with the results.P.S. if the pillow is too low, you could request an additional padding at no extra cost!",

Now that I\u2019ve been using this pillow for several months now, I can honestly say it was worth every penny and some. This pillow has definitely offered me great support for my neck and nice refreshing/comfortable feeling that last throughout the night. This is really a pillow you\u2019ll love if getting the best night sleep is as important for you as it is for me.",

                "reviewText": "I had a bad injury over a year ago that left me with a bulging disc on my neck and wounded my head. The way my head and body are positioned at night determine the quality of the next day and I really needed a solution bc a few months ago, I suffered a shoulder strain while working out and it really setback the condition of my neck and back. I bought this pillow bc of its design to aid my neck and shoulders since I have to sleep on my side and it had an edge over other pillows because of its cooling feature\u2014which I do appreciate. However, I cannot recommend this pillow because it alone has not solved my sleeping problem. If my head isn\u2019t exactly parallel throughout the night, I have headaches and sharp neck pain all day the next day. And idk if my shoulders are broader than most but it\u2019s not thick enough to position my head the way it needs. It sounds silly but I have to stack clothes under the pillow to make sure it\u2019s the right level and for that reason the product doesn\u2019t deserve 5 stars. Will look into another side sleeper pillow with the adequate level unless this company has a different version/product that can help. And btw, if you have a small frame, this pillow could work for you. If you have a larger shoulder frame like myself, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product.",

Its been around two months now and the pillow is holding its shape even when I fold it in half to watch TV lol. I've tried a similar shaped pillow to this one and it did not help at all, this one is just the perfect height for me but maybe YMMV.Thank you Cozyplayer! I will be recommending this pillow to friends and family as well.",

                "reviewText": "This pillow is great for the first few weeks. There is a hole in the centre of the pillow that is meant to work as a spot for your head to settle and also to give the pillow a curved shape but in the bottom of that hole there is a hard plastic fastener that goes through both sides of the pillow to help keep that hole pulled in. The problem is that over time the hole\u2019s sides get weaker and so your head goes into the hole more and the plastic hurts your ear\u2026 like for the whole next day. When I initially reached out to this company about the pillow needing the advertised extra bit of foam to make it fuller, they said they didn\u2019t have any and they gave me a partial refund. I\u2019d probably give the pillow 2 stars if not for the good customer service. That said, I\u2019ve just ordered a different cervical pillow from a different company that doesn\u2019t have a hole or a plastic bit in it.",
