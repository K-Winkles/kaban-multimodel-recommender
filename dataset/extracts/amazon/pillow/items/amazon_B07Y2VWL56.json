They're right there in between firm and soft, with a nice density that also has enough give that you feel supported but not like you're sleeping on a brick. My husband likes to fold his pillows to sleep, and these allow him to do that without being flat or underfilled like most foldable pillows are. They also look nice and fluffy on the bed, so they lend themselves to the comfy made bed aesthetic.Will definitely buy again when I need more pillows in the future!",

THEY STILL DIDN\u2019T LOSE THEIR SHAPE. I have four of them that get regularly rotated, which helps, but still! They\u2019re nice and supportive, but fluffy enough to still be comfortable. My only complaint about them is the thick black line along the sides. I have white sheets and you can absolutely see the line, and it\u2019s not necessary. At least turn it white to match the rest of the pillow!",

                "reviewText": "Having tried so many different pillow types, many that were billed as game changers that became flat and un-fluffable within a month or two, I'm very skeptical of claims where pillows are concerned. Buy sometimes price isn't indicative of quality. And that's the case with these. They arrived flat, packed with all the air sucked out them, like bags of freeze-dried coffee. They fluffed quickly though, and have turned out to be the plumpest pillows I've ever owned.Having used genuine down, various down alternatives, bamboo, copper, buckwheat, and who knows what was inside of some, this was my first memory foam pillow. Memory foam seems to be one of the fad products that companies think they can put into anything to make it sell, whether it's actually effective in that product or not. And I'm now pretty well convinced that using it in pillows was a very good idea. I don't know if it's entirely due to the pillows, but with these, I'm sleeping better than I have in years. I'm an all over sleeper, usually starting on my back, moving to one side or another an hour later, and eventually waking on my stomach, after tossing from side to side a few times during the night. I'm the type who can even work his way to his stomach when sleeping in a hammock or a recliner. I don't remember if I was ever able to make it through the night on my back when I was younger, but I almost did after a week or so with these pillows. I also have yet to wake up with a sore ear, due to sleeping on my side, unlike even the soft down pillows I've owned.The first night, it felt as if the back of my head almost sunk to the mattress. The pillows also didn't give me the support I'm used to for reading in bed. I feared I'd wasted 30 bucks. But then I was surprised at how long I stayed asleep that first night and even more amazed a week or so later when I awoke at 5am to discover I hadn't even turned once yet. I was still sleeping on my back! But with both pillows under my shoulders and head mind you, as I'd fallen asleep reading. For me that was quite surprising. And my nights have been some of the most restful I've had in years ever since. It's still hard to believe a pillow could make that much difference for someone who would still routinely fall into a deep sleep even on a hard concrete floor in his 20s and 30s. But, I'm confident these have made a significant difference.Another great thing is the complete absences of lumps or noticeable shifting of the filling. I don't use them without pillow cases, but they feel comfortable enough and well enough made to do so. It's only been a couple months, but if they're still this fluffy in a year as is claimed, I've found my new go-to pillows, or at least my pillow type, assuming the price hasn't inexplicably changed far exceeding reasonable rates of inflation in that time, as so many products on amazon do.",
