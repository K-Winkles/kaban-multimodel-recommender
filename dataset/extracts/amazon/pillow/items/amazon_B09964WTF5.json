Finding a pillow that is comfortable and provides the support I need has been difficult.This pillow has been perfect. I alternate between sleeping on my back and side. Both of which work great for this pillow. I have not been waking up with neck pain using this pillow. I love the option this pillow has with just rotating it so I can use it for sleeping on my back or side. Awesome pillow and definitely recommend it.",

I will admit the design takes a little bit to get use to because it is different from standard pillows. Now I wake up in the morning and my neck is not stiff and hurting. I am able to get a good nights rest. I am glad I tried this first instead of going to see a chiropractor and spending a ton of money. Forgive the dingy look , as I sleep on it all the time and the hair dye has discolored it. It was a pristine white when purchased. I love it and will continue to use it!!",

For reference, I am 5'3 and ordered the standard sized pillow.",

It aligns my neck with my back perfectly at night and I have stopped having the WORST pain ever from poor pillows. I couldn\u2019t find the right one and was waking up with severe neck pain that when I bent my head down, the pain radiated to my pinched nerve in my shoulder. The first night i bought and used this pillow- it was a WHOLE NEW WORLD. This pillow is comfortable and plush in all the right places and I can\u2019t stress enough how much it has helped. Everyone is different especially in terms of posture when sleeping, but try this and see because for me it\u2019s been a miracle!",
