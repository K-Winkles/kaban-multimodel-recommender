The boys run in & out in all weather, so this is a positive addition. Really a great idea and make the pups beds neat as a pin. Between the fuzzy blankets & managers of stuffed toys. It's one more thing that doesn't tear easily nor have to be cleaned daily, just wiped down if needed and still be a pillow. The pups seem not to mind them being waterproof.",

Even after several washes, they remain intact and effective. Protection against humidity and allergens is an undeniable plus.Weak Points: Although functional, I find their texture slightly stiff, which may affect comfort for some.Robust and Reliable: Compared to other brands, Utopia Bedding offers remarkable durability. The quality is there, ensuring effective and long-lasting protection.BenefitsReliable protectionEasy to washGood value for moneyDisadvantagesSlightly stiff textureLack of softness to the touchPractical adviceTo maximize their lifespan, wash them at a moderate temperature and avoid tumble drying at high temperatures.RecommendationI recommend these pillow protectors for those looking for an effective and durable solution for protecting their bedding, particularly in places like a chalet where hygiene is essential.
