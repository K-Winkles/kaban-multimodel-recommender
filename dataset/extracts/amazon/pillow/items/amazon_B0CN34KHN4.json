When fully stuffed, it is 7-8\u201d thick and pretty heavy. Great for someone in need of real support, and can be adjusted by removing some of the foam to give you the exact amount of support or give you\u2019re looking for. It maintains its shape and does not flatten out even when you rest a good amount of body weight on it for hours. It does not come with a pillowcase, but I easily found one to fit it perfectly. The material is very soft and cooling, and it has a nice sturdy zipper that doesn\u2019t budge on its own. For the price, this is a great deal, and I anticipate it lasting quite a while.",

You can buy more stuffing if you want it more firm. Let it sit about 24 hours to let the pillow fluffy. There is a weird smell inside the pillow. I have let it air out and I can still smell it. Will let it air longer and see if that will help.",

I think it\u2019s a standard size body pillow and normal body pillow cases fit it. It did have a slight chemical smell when opened but that went away within a few hours. You should let it sit for a bit to fluff up because it comes in vacuum sealed. I think mine fluffed within a few hours.",

Pull it out of the case and it expands quickly (I don't know if I'll ever be able to put it back in its zippered carrying case, but I'm not worried about doing that anytime soon.) It supports well, my partner likes it as much as I do, so this was a great acquisition for me. If you're looking for a body pillow, this is a good one!",
