                "reviewText": "As someone who sleeps on their side or stomach, this pillow is great because of the customization of filler. Because of my preferred sleep positions, fluffy large pillows don't work for me. With this one you can easily unzip the pillow and take out or add as much filler as you like, as it does come with extra. I didn't need the extra filling, i took out nearly half and made it into the exact pillow i needed. Whats also nice is encasement itself on the outside is very comfy, soft, and has two sides bamboo and cooling. I have no idea whats in the cooling side but it sometimes feels straight up cold when i flip it over! Also great for those of us who sleep hot. I'm very happy with it and highly recommend!",

It comes with extra foam if you want to make it firmer. However, I found that the existing foam is far more than I needed and removed some. I ran it through a couple of \"freshen up\" cycles in the dryer and that knocked out 80% of the foam order with the rest dissipating in a few days. I think it offers great support and comfort for the price.",
