                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying that I have at least thirty throw pillow covers. They are all very high end and come from all over the world. I am super picky about the pillow forms / inserts that I use. For at least nine years now, I have been searching for that 'perfect' pillow insert. I never found it, so I had basically given up. I was presented with an opportunity to review the Acanva Hypo-Allergenic Pillow Form, so I thought, 'Why not?' Since most of my pillow cushions are 18\" x 18\", I ordered a 20\" x 20\" form. **This is VERY important: ALWAYS get the next size UP pillow form from your pillow cover. You cannot attain and keep the proper fullness unless you go up in size.**My Acanva form arrived very quickly. It was shipped on the 5th and arrived on the 8th. My pillow form was wrapped in a very heavy plastic seal that had been compressed. This was a very good sign to me as it showed that Acanva is concerned over the hypo-allergenic claim. With the form being compressed and sealed, it keeps out allergens, moisture, dust, dander, etc... It is very disconcerting to walk into a arts and crafts store and see pillow forms loosely packaged, open, and with a thin piece of cellophane over it. So to see that Acanva had packaged their forms sealed and compressed let me know immediately that they take pride in their products. When I opened the seal, the pillow form immediately fully opened...nice and plump.What impressed me next was the cover. I have NEVER seen a pillow form covered like this one. The cover is VERY thick (absolutely no show through) and is EXTREMELY soft. The cover is reminiscent of a set of heavy 800 thread count Egyptian sheets that I have. If you have ever bought pillow forms (other than Acanva) before, you'll know that they have a very thin, tearable mesh-like material. This gives no protection and might only last through one washing...might.Lastly, I inserted this form into my pillow cover and it was pure bliss! My beautiful cover had never looked so nice. It's plump and full, but soft and pliable. I even laid on it awhile and it plumped right back to the original size. My search for the perfect pillow form is over! I'm so glad I decided to review this as I will definitely be buying more and replacing all of my old inserts.I so hope this review helps others out there that are looking for a great quality, very reasonably priced pillow form. I did receive this pillow form at a discount in exchange for an honest review. However, I absolutely pride myself in making honest reviews that will actually benefit customers. I would absolutely never recommend something that I wouldn't buy myself at full cost. Please check my review history to see proof of this. Thank you for reading!",

I have been looking for new inserts for them recently after a move since I got rid of the older now lumpy ones and came across this hypo allergenic one. We have pet allergies and low and behold we also have pets so this sounded perfect! This arrived completely flat and I was really concerned that it would not fluff up but upon taking it out of the package it fluffed extremely well. I've had it for a few days and it's probably about 5 inches thick now (a huge difference than the about half inch it was packaged up) It had no plastic odor (you know what I'm talking about) but the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it does not seem to fully fill out my throw pillow covers even though the measurements add up. I will be buying either some filling to add or a second pillow for each cover. It is extremely comfortable for a throw pillow though. Excellent choice, Just wish it was a little fluffier.I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",

You can probably see them in the recommendations below.This one was may be a good fit for others, but not me. In my opinion, the cushion is way too soft for me. My bottom sinks RIGHT to the floor with all the cushioning pushing out around the legs. Some of it stays around your butt, YOU ARE still going to feel that floor under you.There is a slight level of comfort to this as it does pad the area around you and will help warm you up in winter, but I have ordered a similar cushion from another brand here on amazon that actually keeps my bottom at least 6\" off the floor, provides support, and feels like a giant padded seat rather than a pillow you're sinking into. Which is AWESOME!!!So sorry to the company for the lower review as it wasn't really for me, but for any 9f you out there like a butt-sinks-instantly-to-the-floor style cushion, this is for you!Move on or enjoy. Whichever lol.",
