                "reviewText": "I love fluffy pillows so when I saw these I ordered them. They had them vacuum sealed in bags and tightly rolled up so both would fit in a small bag. They were both flat as can be. After I got them out they did fluff up a little bit but I put both of them in a pillow vase together to get my fluffy pillow. I think the picture is misleading. They may have used to look like that but they do not anymore after the packaging.",
