I\u2019ve been using it for 4 night so far and I have to say this is the best pillow I have ever used and I\u2019ve tried a lot of them.I have had back pain for 20+ years upon waking in the mornings. Yesterday when I was at work I thought to myself, did my back hurt this morning when I got up? I didn\u2019t remember wincing in pain when I was getting dressed. This morning when I woke up after a great long night of sleep I made a point of seeing how my back felt as I swung out of bed. Nothing. No twinge, no stiffness, nothing. I couldn\u2019t believe it! I\u2019m a back and side sleeper, mostly back and that is what made my lower back hurt when I woke up. I used to roll to my side and curl up to stretch out my back before I got out of bed to make it easier to move when I got up. This morning I was on my back when I woke up and as I said, no pain, no stiffness. I didn\u2019t believe the people that said that in reviews before but I do now!!! I will recommend this pillow to anyone who says they have back pain.",

                "reviewText": "I went back and forth on leaving a 3 star review. The pillow itself is fantastic. Most comfortable pillow I've ever used. Really helped some neck pain I had from my former pillow. The reason for wanting to leave a low review is the smell. I'm aware that memory foam typically smells bad at first, not my first rodeo with this stuff. When you open the box it states in the literature that it has no smell. Don't put that when it's not true. Been a a week and a half and I still smell it. Want a good pillow? Buy this one and let it air out a few weeks first.",

I was hesitant at first with this pillow since it's an odd shape but I had nothing to worry about as the shape contours the back of the head putting the spine in a better position while sleeping. After a couple of nights of sleep, I felt my quilty of life improve and I recommend cervical pillows to anyone who has poor sleep as it may help them tremendously.",
