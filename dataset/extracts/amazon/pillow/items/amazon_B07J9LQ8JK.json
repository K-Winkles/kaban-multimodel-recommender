The state of his pillows were iffy (at best) & I didn't think he should be resting his head wound on them when he got back from the hospital. I suggested buying new ones, but according to him I'm an idiot and his pillows are \"just fine\". So I bought him these covers instead & slipped them on before he came home. Then I broke up with him for being a jerk. That was before he had a chance to find the covers, so I don't know what his review is, but I was very pleased by the feel, the fit, the quality stitching, and the peace of mind. Thanks Allerease.",

I was worried about size because my new Casper pillows are huge and puffy, but these fit no problem. I definitely feel better knowing my expensive pillows are now covered and protected with these. I love that these protectors are waterproof, bedbug proof, dust mite proof, and all the other good stuff! Very good price for a nice quality product. I am a happy customer.",
