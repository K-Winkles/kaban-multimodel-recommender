The reviews were very hit or miss. Then I found these pillows. I am familiar with the St Regis hotels as I stay at Four Seasons Resorts and the St Regis is in the same high caliber class as the Four Seasons. I knew their bedding would be top. The pillows arrived and they are perfect! Firm and fluffy, yet still soft to conform around your head and give the perfect amount of support. I've had them for a month now and my sleep has never been better. They are completely worth the price!",

It's the best for me after I tried all kind of pillows: shredded memory foam, down alternative, Purple etc. It keeps you cool too so that's nice",
