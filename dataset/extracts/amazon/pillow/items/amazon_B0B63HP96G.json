                "reviewText": "I recently bought the PHF 100% Cotton Waffle Weave Euro Sham Covers (26\" x 26\") and am quite satisfied with my purchase. Priced at $30 for a pack of two, these sham covers are a fantastic deal, especially when compared to similar products from brands like Pottery Barn.What I was looking for was something with a bit of texture yet still simple and elegant, and these pillow covers fit the bill perfectly. The waffle weave design adds just the right amount of texture to make them interesting without being overly ornate.These shams replaced my old Pottery Barn white pillow shams, and I must say, I'm quite impressed with the quality and style, especially considering the price point.Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase. These sham covers offer a great blend of style, comfort, and affordability. They're a perfect choice for anyone looking to add a touch of elegance to their home decor without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!",

The color name is navy blue but I would describe the blue as ever so slightly muted with I really like. The waffle pattern is a nice texture and still soft enough to lay your head on.The 20\" x 26\" size fits my standard pillows well. They're not snug but they're tailored enough so they don't look sloppy.The pillow cases have held up nicely after several washes. The color hasn't faded and there's been no shrinkage even though they're 100% cotton (and very soft).I paired the pillowcases with the waffle blanket in navy blue and they look really nice together.",

Before purchasing this pillowcase, I used to cover my pillow with a satiny type pillowcase. Though it protected my hair and was soft, it did not look that great--it was shapeless and made the pillow I slept on look squishy. But, this case not only alleviates the squishiness, but the beautiful lace pattern is eye catching too! My husband even complimented me on it! I'm going to have to buy another one as a backup. Well worth the price.",
