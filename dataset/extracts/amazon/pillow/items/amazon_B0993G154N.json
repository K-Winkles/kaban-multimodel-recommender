                "reviewText": "*This is a HONEST review from a real buyer! I read reviews about everything before purchasing and I often feel mislead.. I hope that my review can help someone else who may be having the same issues or sleep in the same strange position as I do*After suffering a neck and shoulder injury in early January I've spent the whole year and a ton of money searching for and testing anything and everything to provide even the slightest bit of relief. Finally my search has ended thanks to this pillow!I am an avid side sleeper and although medium to hard pillows are recommended, my whole life I have gotten away with the big soft fluffy pillows with no problems at all, that is until my injury. On my 2022 pillow hunt journey I've tried pillows made of all different things, shapes and sizes and each one seemed to be worse than the last and almost all of them (although the claim to be medium) are so hard I swear you can knock someone out with it.The Sidney pillow was one of the first to go in my cart but I kept putting it off due to some of bad reviews I read (particularly the chemical burn ones) and ended up going for more expensive pillows.HUGE MISTAKE!Finally I was in such extreme pain, sleep deprived, desperate and seen this pillow could arrive that night so ordered it and ordered 2 other kinds of pillows as well just incase.. Sidney pillow showed up around 4 am I immediately took it out of the package threw my own pillow case over it and tried laying on it right away before it fully expanded. There was a slight smell but I didn't care I had no patience and I just wanted sleep. After a few minutes I decided to add more stuffing (because it had not yet expanded fully) and layed back down and FINALLY got some sleep. When I woke up I did remove some of the stuffing and put it back in the bag and left the pillow to lay out with both the cover it comes with and my own off for the remainder of the day and occasionally fluffing it. By bedtime the smell was gone and it took just a little fluffing to get it how I wanted it and then I drifted off to the land of nod.The sidney pillow is what I would consider a \"medium\" pillow. Not so hard you feel like your laying on a rock but not so soft you have no neck support and falling into it. The slight curve in the pillow may not look as though it would make that big of a difference. I personally underestimated the curve lol. Now I can't imagine using a pillow without that curve. Ive tried many contour pillows but they are always so hard and they dont properly support the curve of my neck as they are to high and seem to be more for back sleepers. I never sleep with my pillow laying horizontally.. I like to sleep on my right side with my right arm upwards and underneath my pillow and kinda hug it. Normally this makes me need two pillows one to hug and another to lay my head on but that needs constant adjustment as I move or there are L or J shapped pillows but those do not provide enough pillow to hug on the longer leg side of it plus they take up a lot of space in bed. So if you sleep like me, the curve with the Sidney Pillow allows you to perfectly form around it and the pointed corner ends wraps under your neck and head and around your shoulder giving the extra support normal rectangular pillows do not.After the first time sleeping on it I already felt less neck pain when waking up. After 3 days zero neck pain or shoulder pain upon waking up. Of course as the day goes on depending what I'm doing the pain starts to creep back up on me but with the help of this pillow I'm easily and comfortably able to get to sleep each night. No more tossing and turning all night, no smell after airing the pillow out and allowing it to expand properly and no chemical burn which was my biggest fear cause I have super sensitive skin. I do not feel the cubes of stuffing as others said through the pillow case when I lay on it or even by running my hand over it. The cubes are very tiny and in no way jabbing at your face lol. It does take a little fluffing at first but I have not needed to constantly fluff it or had issues with it losing its shape. In fact the longer I've used it the better it has gotten as it has molded perfectly to me and my bodies natural curves and where I need the support.I know going off others reviews is difficult when it comes to pillows because everyone is different and sleeps differently but I truly think this pillow could be the one for just about anyone as it's easily adjustable to your liking of firmness and it molds to you and your body and sleeping position rather than the permanent pre cut and shaped you see with other pillows.I definitely recommend this pillow just be sure to remove the pillow case it comes with and allow it to air out and occasionally fluffing it during this process to release the fumes and help it expand properly. You may want to play around with the amount of stuffing you want in it to find what is best for you but don't lose patience if the first night it's not perfect because the more you sleep on it the more it will form to you and your curves. It truly becomes a pillow that seems as if it was molded just for you. I also don't recommend using it as a pillow you lean against in bed when sitting up reading or watching tv because that will change the form it has built for your individual neck, head, and shoulders.",

                "reviewText": "I have been on a quest to find the perfect pillow for YEARS!!! Pillows were either too soft, too firm, too thick, or too thin. THIS ONE IS PERFECT!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!! I sleep in all positions, so that\u2019s another huge reason I haven\u2019t been able to find a great pillow for myself. I sleep on my back, both sides, and my stomach. And this pillow has been AMAZING in EVERY POSITION!! I love the shape of it, the softness, the just right firmness, the way it doesn\u2019t lose shape, the way you can fluff it wherever you need a little more fluffing, and the way you can reduce or increase the stuffing! I still have not added or taken out any stuffing, but I love knowing that I can any time I need to. When I first opened it, I fluffed it in the dryer on low heat for 15 minutes (per instructions), and it came out so marshmallowy perfect!Please excuse all of f my exclamation points in this review, but I have been searching for the perfect pillow for so long, I am ECSTATIC to have FINALLY found it!!!!!!! NO MORE SORE NECK & FINALLY GREAT SLEEP!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a stomach/side sleeper and had purchased a new set of pillows after moving which turned out to be way too bouncy and \u201cresilient\u201d. Even after six months, they wouldn\u2019t flatten out in the least - I was tossing and turning every night, getting a pain in my neck and tension headaches from the odd angles these unyielding pillows put me through. This pillow is a godsend! Although it comes with a pouch of extra filling, I don\u2019t need it, as it\u2019s just enough the way it is - which is nearly flat. Although it\u2019s quite flat, the memory foam inside is strong enough that I still feel cushioned. The shape makes it easy to get a little support on your face as well as neck when you\u2019re sleeping in your back or side. The dark grey color is perfect and the quilting is nice. Only downsides are that I can see little tufts of stuffing already coming out from the stitching and also it\u2019s pretty impossible to find a cover that fits. Having said that, if you turn it around, it resembles the silhouette of a cat head, bonus!",

It's slightly strange having a pillow this shape and it's easy not to put your head properly on it so resting the crown rather than whole side of head but you'll know because your just nit as comfy as you should be so pull it down securely under your head and although you know your heads on something but alchmy happens as once your resting on it youve not much time to think because your fast asleep which for insomniac me is great.You don't need to search for the right shape pillow case as I did but use a regular pillowcase it doesn't detract from the pillowYou get a nice back with lots of extra memory foam so you'll be able to use as much or as little as suits you bestI found using a bit more than I expected to need was best for meI would recommend this pillow",
