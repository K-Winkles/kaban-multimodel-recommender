These provided both.My one caveat is that I thought the \"envelope\" style pillowcase was like most others with the closure in the back, however it's at the top and is a narrow piece of fabric and doesn't hold the pillow closed very well.But in case I confused you, sorry, I liked them despite the location of the closure. They are buttery soft, warm and I have noticed no pilling. They are also a nice standard size and the sage green is a very pretty shade. I also purchased a fitted sheet that matches and I love how comfortable and soft they feel.If you're looking for some nice pillowcases, invest in these. The price is right, fast free delivery with Amazon Prime. You won't be unhappy that you did.God bless",

It, surprisingly keeps my hair nicer while I seep-I can only assume because they are so soft. Great quality. Great price. If only they had more colors, however, hese will be my go-to for black.",

                "reviewText": "For 'MY PILLOW' pillows, queen, these pillowcases work perfectly. (These pillows are filled with chunks of memory foam, so they do loose its shape over time, although they fluff back up when washed or tossed in the dryer.) These stretch pillow cases work perfectly with my 'My Pillow' queen size, and probably also with odd shaped foam/memory foam pillows.After sleeping on it for a week I noticed that the pillow case fits no longer smoothly around the pillow, it had slipped on one side a little, wrinkled. But that had no adverse effect on its unbelievable softness or my restful sleep. It would be visible though. So if you have a problem with not having an exactly and perfectly made bed then Jersey pillow cases will not meet your standards, as the Jersey fabric is a little stretchy, just like t-shirts.I however, prefers a soft pillow to rest my head on all night over a perfectly made bed. Besides, I don't usually invite visitors to inspect my bedroom, and mother's critical eyes don't bother me anymore ;-).This pillow case is a dream, and I only have fun dreams now, it is so incredibly soft. The envelop closure is perfect, because even if the case starts to wrinkle a little because of its stretchiness, it keeps the pillow from slipping out of the pillowcase. It is soft enough I didn't even notice the little wrinkle. It doesn't really stretch much just a little wrinkle.It washes well and keeps it shape after washing and dryer.If you have troubles getting them on your pillow, turn it inside out, slide your hands into it to the corners, grab the cornes of your pillow with your hands inside the corners of the pillowcase, and slip pillowcase over the rest of the pillow. When removing pillowcase let it turn inside out and wash it that way, then it's ready for putting it back on the pillow right out of the dryer. BTW this is how I learned to put on and take off all pillowcases of any fabric. This gives you a perfect corner fit without having to fiddle with them after its on the pillow. Great for those of use who demand perfection in everything, lol.In short, I love these pillowcases and just ordered two more colors to match my cotton sheet sets. I won't buy the Jersey sheets because they kinda stick to me as I toss and turn in sleep and leave my bed very wrinkled and uncomfortable. They are stretchy jersey fabric regardless what fibers is used.Oh, and there has been no pilling in two weeks of use, that would be very uncomfortable.",

We even brought them on a short vacay last week, and didn't forget to bring them home because of the vibrant color. This review is for the turquoise.",
