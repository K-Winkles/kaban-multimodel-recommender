                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write many reviews, only when I purchased a product that is exceptional. We have purchased hotel grade pillows in the past, but the name brand that were we were use to purchasing was no longer available. Pillows of this quality were too expensive to buy from other manufacturers. It\u2019s been several years since that I\u2019ve not been able to find a pillow that is not only exceptional in quality, support and comfort but is an exceptional value. It is difficult to put all those words in the same sentence. I hope the \u201cThree Geese\u201d company will be around for many years to come and continue to offer their quality product.",

They fluff nicely and keep a decent shape when sleeping so he is in heaven. He says they make our bed look high end. LOL. If you like down/feather pillows these are a great set at a value add price. They do need pillow cases that are slightly bigger than a standard or the type that zip shut. Otherwise a total score!",
