                "reviewText": "Most important info first, using this pillow for the past few weeks has eliminated my soar neck and back I was waking up with. I am using the pillow in the side sleeping position with the thicker contour under my neck. I can tell I don\u2019t toss/ turn as much because my hair isn\u2019t messed up when I wake up.The zipper cover looks and feels like good quality. The memory foam feels premium. It has a good density and rebound characteristic unlike cheap memory foam. It does a have foam smell to it that isn\u2019t pleasant, but it is minimal in comparison to other foam products. On a scale of 1-10 of foam off gassing odor it\u2019s a 3. It doesn\u2019t bother me when I\u2019m sleeping and the cotton pillow case I put over it traps in the smell. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s currently possible to have foam that has zero off gas smell and the toxin exposure is worth the physical benefit to me at this time. Royal Therapy is using a very good quality foam and I would recommend this pillow. Thank you = )",

Pillow is still in great shape, no flattening out in any areas or decrease in comfort or intended function and it appears like it will keep going that way for quite awhile. While I mostly use the lower contour of the pillow if my neck is bothering me more than usual I go to the higher side for a night or two and every thing works out great.It's nice the cover can be taken off to be washed. My only knock on this product would be it can be a bit of work to get the foam insert back into the cover.",
