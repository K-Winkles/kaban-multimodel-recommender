                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison between the 4 pack Anti-Allergy and 4 pack Regular",
                "reviewText": "I had a really hard time deciding between the Anti-Allergy and the much less expensive 'standard' 4 pack, so I ordered both, since I have lots of pillows anyway.My biggest gripe is not allergy as much as trying to stuff oversized pillows into several pillowcases to protect them. I bought new multi-chambered down/feather pillows (down outside, chambered feathers inside). These require dry cleaning and cannot be washed. That means you HAVE to make sure they stay clean as long as possible.With a smaller pillow, you can fit several pillow cases over the pillow, but it's much easier with a zipper if you have an overstuffed pillow, so that sent me looking for pillow protectors. I bought Queen for both packs, again because my pillows are overstuffed, and the ones that aren't I can just tuck the ends over.Both versions of these are an excellent value. I have not washed them yet, so can't speak for how they wash, but there's plenty of reviews here who do. I'm just comparing the difference between the 2 versions, because that was the biggest decision, and since I didn't know the difference, I bought both versions. I'll use the more expensive ones for feather/down pillows.The 'standard' striped 4 pack were $12.99, the Anti-allergy were $24.99. That's almost double the price for the same number of cases, so I expected a huge difference. There ARE differences. And if you need them for feather/down/dry clean only pillows, it's worth it because they are thicker fabric and better/larger zippers. They are also sateen weave. This helps a LOT with overstuffed pillows, which need a slicker surface to slide a case into.The standard are thinner fabric. You can hold them up to the light and see through them. That doesn't mean they are not protecting your pillows, the weave is very tight. The striping look like damask, but because they aren't the long fibered cotton like pima or Supima, they will likely come out of the wash rougher after you wash. But 4 for $12.99 means they cost $3.25 each! Holy moly, you can't buy the fabric to make them yourself for that!Zipper on the standard are the smallest cheapest zippers. They are almost exactly like the plastic bag container zippers for expensive sheets or comforter sets. They are not durable, strong or well made, and very small. For $3.25 each, they are still a great deal, and these are PROTECTORS, not pillow cases, you are not supposed to be using them as pillow cases you wash every week. They are supposed to be washed like every few months, with a case or 2 pillow cases over them that gets washed more often. With frequent washing, I wouldn't be surprised that the cheap zippers fall off, tear, or simply break. If you are not removing them all the time, they will probably last years. These are an INCREDIBLE value for protectors.The Anti-allergy double the price ones are nice. Really surprisingly nice. The fabric is nicer than most 100% cotton normal store pillow cases, with a tighter weave, which makes me wonder if this is actually a cotton/microfiber blend, not 100% cotton. The texture seems a bit fuzzy, but it's a solid sateen weave, so pillows slip in them fine. At $24.99, they are $6.25 each. That's about the price of regular pillowcases, and these are nicer than most. The zippers on the Anti-allergy are almost 2x bigger and higher quality than the 'standard' above. The weave is very tight, and you could easily use them as a pillowcase alone. They are really great for protecting your down and/or feather pillows tho, with 1 or 2 regular pillowcases over them because washing even the non-dry cleaning ones are so incredibly time-consuming, and the price make them a great deal.Would definitely buy either type again at these prices, they are well worth it!",

                "reviewText": "I initially thought they were thin but after opening the package, they are nice. I was concerned when I ordered them, they're going on gusseted pillows, but they fit very well. They are also satiny in texture, so they slide right into pillow cases even with the thicker pillows. They wash up nicely and the zipper (plastic) doesn't distort, so that's a good thing. Overall, well worth the money",

                "reviewText": "I bought a two-pack of these pillow covers through Amazon a few years ago and really liked them. They were advertised as 100% cotton, and I only wanted 100% cotton, When I received them, they were definitely a great 100% cotton... soft, but good, strong, high thread-count cotton material. They have also held up well through multiple washings. Finally, they were stained and worn out, and I needed to replace them.So, when I needed more pillow covers, I ordered these again, this time in a four-pack. It seemed impossible to determine prior to the new purchase whether or not they were still 100% cotton or were a polyester/cotton blend. There was conflicting information on various portions of the listing and photos, but I took the chance and ordered them.I am happy to say that, although they do not have any fabric information (tags,etc.) on them, the ones I received DO APPEAR to be the same 100% cotton covers that I bought previously. I really like them, but there was a problem.As soon as I received them I washed them before use. When I took them out of the dryer I found that two of the four had separated along the long side seam. On closer inspection, I found that it appeared that the seam was defective, having been sewn too close to the edge of the material, so that it frayed and came apart along the seam. The other two seemed to be just fine.Disappointed, I contacted the Seller via Amazon Message, explaining the situation and asking what we could do to resolve it, and received a very prompt (within about two hours) response. Of course, I knew that I could just return them through Amazon for refund or replacement, but it seemed like it would be a waste of expense for the Seller or Amazon to pay the return shipping for a defective product. The Seller was really GREAT about it, and offered to just send me out a new four-pack to replace what I had, and just keep the two good ones from the first package without the need to return them. Two days later, I had the replacements in hand and they were just fine.The bottom line is that, while we all know that even a great product can occasionally have a defective item or two, what really stands out in a case like that is how the merchant handles the problem. The Seller (and perhaps manufacturer?) Niagara Sleep Solutions definitely rated FIVE STARS FOR THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THEIR EVENTUAL PRODUCT!!!",
