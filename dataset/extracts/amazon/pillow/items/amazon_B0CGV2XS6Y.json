                "reviewText": "The pillow came nicely packaged. After opening it, I was surprised at how it fluffed up in only a few minutes. I did notice a slight chemical smell originally but it dissipated quickly and after an hour or two, the smell was completely gone. The pillow is well constructed and I like the removable cover with zipper. I am a side sleeper but I shift to different positions throughout the night. I felt the pillow was comfortable for all positions. For my main position of side sleeping, the memory foam was firm enough to support the position, but soft enough to form to my body. It supported my natural posture so I was comfortable throughout the night. Some pillows get very hot from body heat, but this one stayed nice and cool. I woke up after a well rested sleep and felt no discomfort in my neck or back as I have with other pillows in the past. I would recommend this pillow and would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "One thing about me is that I am very particular about my pillow. Seriously, it\u2019s a problem. I kept the same pillow for years (gross, I know) because I didn\u2019t know where to get another just like it and I looked everywhere. I would not travel without this pillow. I left it at a friends house out of town once and could not sleep well until I got it back! I saw a deal for this on Amazon, and I thought I\u2019d give it a try. Couldn\u2019t hurt. Best. Decision. Ever. It immediately replaced my favorite pillow, as well as the pillow I kept underneath it because it wasn\u2019t thick enough to support my neck. This pillow is perfect by itself, as it provides the perfect amount of support! Needless to say, I tossed out the old one and now I know where to replace it when the new one gets old! Great purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This pillow surprised me. I find with a lot of these solid memory foam pillows they end up being too thick, firm, etc for me to be comfortable using them. This one however seems pretty perfect. It is supportive yet I sink in enough so my neck isn't at an angle. Just what I have been looking for. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish they would also include the thin cover over the foam piece, like some do, so it is easier to remove and replace the outer cover when washing etc. I would definitely recommend giving this a try. And it's a good price too. :)",

                "reviewText": "Love Amazon, but this product was a complete waste of my money. Soon as you open the package you have to give the pillow time to inflate, which is understandable, but the horrible smell that emanates from the pillow is unbearable. It smells like straight chemicals. So I figured I\u2019ll wash the cover, maybe that will help. Problem there is the zipper sucks! It was hard to unzip (and yes I did the pinch and hold technique) and when I go to zip the pillow back up it breaks on the track. I haven\u2019t even washed it yet and already the item defective. I wish I could return this pillow and get my money back because I won\u2019t be using it. Absolutely zero stars.",

There is a slight smell and you can't see how a thin piece of fabric can turn into a pillow like the one in the photo. But alas, it fills up in time (around 3-5 hours) and the smell goes away by the second sleep!",

                "reviewText": "I have 2 top-brand pillows that are very soft foam which I love, but they are exorbitantly expensive. I tried this to see what a reasonable price could buy. In the past, most regular foam pillows have felt essentially like bricks to me. This does not. It is much firmer than my beloved expensive foam pillows, but it is squishy enough that I actually sleep fine on it, which surprised me. So if you know you like a foam pillow, this is probably a medium softness one and the price is reasonable.",
