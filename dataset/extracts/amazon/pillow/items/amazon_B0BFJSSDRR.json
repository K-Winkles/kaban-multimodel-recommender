                "reviewText": "I'll admit. I bought the set of two because I was going to keep one for myself and give the other to a close friend. But when they came I tried to use my pillow and had a very difficult time adjusting to using it. It just seemed like this big lump under my head...no given support, no memory of my head, nothin'. But I kept thinking maybe he would like his...that is until I went to visit him and one of the pillows he gave me to use was a memory foam and he said I could take it home with me because he \"hated it\". Well, there went that Christmas present idea out the window.I didn't use mine much after that until my mother gave me one that she didn't like; she said she \"never could get used to it.\" So I brought it home and liked it right away. I don't know the brand or anything, but it is oddly shaped so that your head is cradled in a cut out area. Since I really liked that pillow I thought I'd give this pillow another try. As I used it more it began to 'sink in' and 'remember' my head. It became more and more comfortable.I have been using this pillow on a nightly basis now and I have to say it is quite comfortable and I am happy to report that it is doing the job it was intended to do.Buy this pillow(s) and give them a try. And if you're like me, and it takes a while to see any type of improvement to your sleep or anything, be patient and let it do it's thing. It's worth it when it gets there.",

                "reviewText": "The pillow is not as cooling as I hoped it would be. Infact, after using it for about three weeks, I went back to my previous pillow with an Alaska Bear silk pillowcase over it, result: cooler than these cooling pillows from Amazon. I suppose I could put the Alaska Bear silk pillowcase on one of these cooling foam pillows and see if this makes for an even cooler sleep (will try tonight). Other than not being cooling enough for me, I like how the pillow feels-firm but too firm, has a bit of a give just. Do I regret buying these? Not really, they will do...I guess.",

The pillow is not high enough so when your head goes down the memory foam it can do down too much, but I found putting another normal pillow either underneath or on top helps. Also another factor is the smell. It lingers for a few weeks, but again a normal pillow on top helps with that.The gel on top is really good and stay cool for about 10 min only.",
