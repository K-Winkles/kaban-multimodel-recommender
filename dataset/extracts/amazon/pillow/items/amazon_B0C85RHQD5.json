                "reviewText": "I am a petite side sleeper. Occasionally I sleep on my back. I was experiencing neck pain from my memory foam pillow and decided it was time to find a new pillow. I have tried 12 different pillows. Anything from contour pillows to the higher end bed gear, sleep number and purple harmony pillows. I didn't really care about cost, just wanted a good night's sleep without neck pain. After trying so many pillows, I decided to try this one. I like that this can be ordered in a standard size, it has a gusset, the memory foam is adjustable and has the polyester fill mixed in to make it softer. I removed alot of the fill to fit my size. You can tell the inside pillow case and outside cover are not as high end as the other pillows, but for me this is a bonus as the gusset does not have the cording that ends up poking you in the neck. I don't think this pillow sleeps cool, however I use a regular pillow protector and pillow case. Possibly using a cooling pillow protector could help. I would recommend trying this pillow. It has worked for me and you cannot beat the price.",

After reading so many reviews for days I finally decided on this pillow and I love it. It did have a smell from the packing but, I sprayed it with fabreeze and waited awhile and sprayed it a second time and it was fine no smell. Not concerned about the cooling just the comfort.
