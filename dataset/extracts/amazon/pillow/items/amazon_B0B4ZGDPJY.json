            "Reduce Neck & Back Pain : The Reoka cervical support pillow, introduces a gradual slope that cradles the neck from the base of the spine all the way to your head. This slope keeps your neck from being pinched due to lack of support as well as keeping your back more aligned",

As a back sleeper pillow, the base of the neck is cradled gently. As a side sleeping pillow, the same slope makes room for your shoulder and keeps your spine straight. As a stomach sleeping pillow, the raised shape makes it easier to breathe and put your arms around",

Made using natural processes, this eco-friendly pillow will last for years with each day as supportive as the first day you tried it",
            "Cool & Therapeutic Pillow : Our natural cooling pillowcase is super soft and breathable. It easily transfers your body heat throughout the pillow over night to keep the surface nice and cool. The pillow case is removable for easy washing and drying. During washing infuse with therapeutic aroma essences for an unforgettable nights sleep!",

It helped so much with my neck and back pain. The pillow is so comfortable and I have been using it for a while now and it still hasn\u2019t flattened even a little. It is just so comfortable!",

                "reviewText": "I read all the reviews before I purchased this pillow and most are accurate as far as it looking strange, and maybe being too flat.It does feel different when you lay your head down but I am confident that the way this pillow is designed it's for side sleepers one hundred percent.You have to get used to it.I order large medium. It's definitely a medium feel not too firm not soft. It really feels good. Very comfortable. I'm not feeling the arm pain laying on my side.Definitely recommend getting the size large tho, I couldn't imagine this pillow smaller. This size is perfect.I have sleep apnea and other sleep issues.I will come back in a month to give an update.As for now if you have issues side sleeping neck and arm pain from sleeping I recommend this pillow",

But I usually end up going back to an old pillow because the shaped pillow is just too firm.I chose the soft option and I'm happy to report that I have used it every night ever since I received it. Going on 3-4 months now.",
