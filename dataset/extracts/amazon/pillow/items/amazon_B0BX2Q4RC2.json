It\u2019s very soft and you can adjust the thickness. Be sure to air it out for 24 hours, I missed that in the instructions when I first read it and noticed a slight odor the first night. The only reason I didn\u2019t give five stars is because the zipped casing that holds the layers is also filled. It says it\u2019s washable but I know if I put it in the washer it\u2019s going to mess up the filling so I\u2019ll instead just buy a pillow cover to go over that. Otherwise, it\u2019s a good pillow.",

Sometimes on my stomach that\u2019s a wee bit too high and hurts my neck. But on my side it\u2019s great. If I end up in my back it\u2019s not the best but it\u2019s okay. If you love down pillows and are trying for a hypoallergenic replacement these are pretty good. I don\u2019t believe anyone will want the pillow with less than two of the three inserts!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these pillows as a back up pair but since putting them on the bed, I cannot believe the softness and support we are getting. My partner is a side sleeper and says they are the best pillows he's slept on. I am a back sleeper and with the removal on one insert, my neck pain has gone and I'm sleeping so much better. These pillows are soft and comfy. I'm getting another set as my back up!!",

                "reviewText": "Very novel idea for people who like to vary pillow thickness. My wife likes a thinner pillow than I do so this pair was a great choice. However, the tag says machine wash gentle, and I like to wash all new items before using so I did. BIG MISTAKE. The insides of the pillow clumped up into blobs of lumpiness. Still reasonably comfortable though. No returns because it's a marketplace seller.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This pillow is completely flat in the middle where I lay my head after 2 weeks of use . The actual pillow itself is flat- there is no filling. The inserts inside of the pillow that make it adjustable are made with the same material for the large pillow they\u2019re flat in the middle as well. I wake up 2-3 times a night readjusting. This pillow has caused my extreme pain in my neck and back.The filling is the same filling in your cheap Walmart/ikea pillows. In fact you can probably make this yourself for 15 -20 dollars. ISleep on my stomach so my neck needs support. This can\u2019t be possible if the pillow is flat to the point I\u2019m sleeping on the fabric lining of the pillow. Very disappointed would like a refund.",
