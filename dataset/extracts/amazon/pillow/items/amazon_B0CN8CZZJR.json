Then put it into your dryer on low for 5-10 minutes. This will get your shredded memory foam pillow to its best shape and normal fluffy. How to Care for Your Pillow: 1.Remove the outer cover and machine wash or hand wash it, hang it dry. Do not bleach. 2. You may want to put your pillow in the dryer every 3-4weeks for 5-10 minutes, This will help the pillow retain its desired shape and texture. 3.The shredded memory foam can't be washed. Do not machine wash the pillow directly. Please only wash the pillowcase. 4. Place the filling inside in a ventilated place for drying.",

                "reviewText": "This is my favorite pillow out of the hundreds I've used over 46 years. Frankly, I was a bit skeptical because a famous, cable news advertising version of this kind of pillow gets universally lambasted. I wasn't sure about the shredded memory foam construction, but I now see the brilliance of the design. Unlike the memory foam pillows I've used in the past (which I liked), this one caresses my head better. I think it's due to all the individual pieces better conforming to my head and neck than the typical single-piece pillows.It's absolutely freezing at the time I'm writing this review, so I can't comment on how cooling it is, but I wouldn't be surprised if the cooling works as advertised. I'm not quite sure how to explain it, but it doesn't have that dense, trapping the heat from my head feeling of most pillows. It feels light and airy rather than dense and warm.The most important criterion for how well a pillow performs is how well I sleep with it, and so far so good with this one! I feel like I'm sleeping sounder and waking less. I also feel like I'm getting better sleep.If you've never tried a torn memory foam pillow, and you're struggling to find a pillow that works for you, I recommend this one.",

You can remove the padding to your hearts desire to get the perfect fit for your sleeping needs. I'm very impressed with the memory foam cooling effects you get from prolonged usage over time. It's stuffed rather well, so you get to take out what you don't need. I'm not sure where you put the extra foam, perhaps in a large storage bag?Overall, it's a very well made pillow with a ton of uses and effects. You get to choose how soft/firm you would like it to be, and it seems to be really well made. The stitching itself is excellent, and everything seems to work well. I'm impressed, well made and well done guys. Thanks!",

Adding the extra shredded memory foam (included), helped. The pillow is firmer and more supportive now, and he says it gave him a comfortable night's sleep. The cover is very breathable, and does seem to have a cooling effect. The inner cover can easily be unzipped to add more foam, and the outer cover can easily be unzipped for washing. I think this pillow is a good value, and would recommend it if you are looking for a comfortable pillow which can be customized to your preference.",

You don't have to use an additional pillow protector because you can take the bamboo cover off for washing. Inside the cover is a zippered cloth pillow filled with finely cut memory foam. You can take out foam or put more in depending on the firmness and height you require. I like a softer pillow so I removed about 1/3 of the foam. Then I shook the pillow to distribute the foam evenly inside the cover. What a wonderful pillow this is. My head sinks down on the pillow and my neck is still supported. It is so comfortable. It uses high quality foam and it really makes a difference. I will definitely be ordering some more.",

This is truly the most comfortable pillow I've had, maybe ever. It's nice that it's customizable, with extra filler if you like a fuller pillow. Honestly, it comes with plenty! If you don't like it so full then take some out. It comes in a zippered cover, then that cover has a zippered cover. It came vacuum sealed, and I just put in the dryer a couple minutes and * Viola *, likely the most comfy pillow your head has been on in awhile! Highly recommend \ud83d\udc4c",
