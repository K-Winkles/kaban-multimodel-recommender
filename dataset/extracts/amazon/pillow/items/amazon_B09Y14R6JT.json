                "reviewText": "I have been using this pillow for sleeping every night for the last week. It is the perfect amount of firm for me, and I love that it is never lumpy or out of shape since it is solid memory foam rather than stuffing. I have been sleeping quite well on it, though it took me about a week to get used to. My only complaint is that the bigger of the two humps is just a little too big to very be comfortable for me. When I sleep on my back it puts too much pressure on my neck, and when I sleep on my side it lifts my head just a little too high. So, I almost always use the smaller side. I might get used to the bigger one more over time though; I still usually try it once or twice a night. All that to say, it's not perfect, but it is truly amazing for the price.",

It\u2019s the perfect blend of soft and firm, a few of these I\u2019ve tried are way too dense and become hard as a rock in cold weather. Not this one, stays soft enough for me. The cover it comes with seems well made, just a nice product overall.",
