I've heard some bad things about straight memory foam pillows not holding up after just a year, and the cotton filled pillows are always too thin and flimsy.When I saw these pillows could be opened and one could remove or add filling to their liking, and that they were relatively cheap and not just straight memory foam, I figured they would be worth a shot.The pillows are surprisingly thick and firm, but still soft and maleable. I sleep on my side and stomach mostly, and they can form to those positions seemlessly. I haven't even felt the need to touch the level of stuffing, but I have kept one pillow off to the side just in case; but after a week of using them, I can safely say they are exactly the pillows I needed.",
