                "reviewText": "I\u2019m in love! I have purchased an embarrassing number of pillows in the last 2 years in an effort to find the right one for me. I discovered that not all pillows work with all mattresses after buying a new mattress. With this pillow, it doesn\u2019t matter what mattress you have, because it is easy to adjust it to your preference. Save the stuffing you remove, and you can add it back if ever needed. The outer layer is luxuriously soft and well made. For my needs, it\u2019s a little thick, which isn\u2019t a deal breaker. But if I wasn\u2019t a side-sleeping cpap user, it would be perfect. They arrive vac sealed but puff up quickly. They are pretty overstuffed, which is great if you want to get a third pillow with what you pull out.",

I've bought these many times for beds around my house and they are amazing. They are long lasting (I still use the others I bought a couple years back) and soft and they give the support it needs. I love how you can remove the foam to adjust how much you need. I never remove them but it's always good to have that option available. I'm a side sleeper so I'm not sure about back sleepers but from my experience... This is one of the best pillows to get. It's worth the price for sure.",

They could not be manipulated in a position to be made comfortable.This pillow is \"heavy\", packed full of memory foam shreds and firm!HOWEVER,This pillow also gives into the weight of the face and neck without losing its firmness!The zippers are high quality!The outer cover is super soft and well sewn.The inner cover is also well sewn and fairly soft.The memory foam shreds are cube-ish and very small making the pillow super soft.I have been through SO MANY EXPENSIVE pillows in the past two years trying to find a GOOD pillow!*** THIS is the ONE! ***Did I mention DELIVERED SAME DAY!? THANK YOU AMAZON! Ordered two more!",
