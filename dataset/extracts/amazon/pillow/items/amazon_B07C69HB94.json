                "reviewText": "I bought these and the Beckham Hotel Collection Gel pillows for $39.99. I sleep mainly on my side with another pillow along side me to prop me at a 45 degree angle or so. I'm really picky about pillows which is why I've stayed with mine even though it's now lumpy. The Beckham pillows came first. Supper fluffy and turned out too full/fluffy. Put my neck at an angle and smushed my face when I slept on my side--unless I slept in the very corner. I didn't last the night on it.These DreamNorth pillows came next. Yes, they are more on the flat side, but that's what I want as a side sleeper. I often sleep with my arm under the pillow/under by head so can't have too full a pillow. These were about just right. Soft, but not overly full. Still good support. I realized the other Beckham pillows made a great #2 pillow that props me up. Excellent at that actually. So I will put one of each on my bed and one of each on my guest bed. So nice to have a fresh, clean non-lumpy pillow. Can't believe I waited so long, esp at these low prices.",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my bedroom with the DreamNorth Premium Gel Pillow Loft, coming in a convenient pack of two. After several nights of sleep, I'm ready to share my experience with these pillows in terms of comfort, support, and overall sleep quality.**Comfort and Material:** The pillows feature a gel-filled fiber, which strikes a beautiful balance between softness and support. They are plush and comfortable, molding gently to the shape of the head and neck. The material feels premium, and there's a sense of luxury when you rest on them.**Hypoallergenic Features:** For those sensitive to allergens, these pillows are a great choice. They are hypoallergenic, which is a huge plus for anyone with allergies or asthma. I noticed a reduction in nighttime sniffles, which was a pleasant surprise.**Support and Firmness:** These pillows offer a medium level of firmness. They provide adequate support for both side and back sleepers, keeping the head and neck comfortably aligned. However, if you prefer an extra firm or a very soft pillow, these might not meet your specific firmness preference.**Breathability and Cooling Effect:** The gel fiber does a good job of regulating temperature, keeping you cool throughout the night. This feature is especially appreciated by those who tend to sleep hot or live in warmer climates.**Size and Loft:** The size is standard and fits well in regular pillowcases. The loft is just right \u2013 not too high or too flat. They maintain their shape well, bouncing back after use, which is indicative of good quality.**Maintenance and Durability:** These pillows are machine washable, which makes maintenance easy. They held up well in the wash, retaining their shape and fluffiness. The durability seems promising, although longer-term use is needed to fully assess their lifespan.**Price Point:** For a pack of two, the price is reasonable. Considering the quality and features, they offer good value for money.**Limitations:** The pillows might emit a faint chemical smell upon unpacking, but this dissipates after airing them out for a day or two.**Conclusion:** The DreamNorth Premium Gel Pillow Loft pack of 2 is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their sleep experience. They offer a luxurious feel, balanced support, and hypoallergenic properties, all at a reasonable price point. While they might not cater to every firmness preference, they strike a great balance that will appeal to a wide range of sleepers.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying that when I received the pillows, inside with the packaging was a card that said 'get $20 Amazon credit when you leave a five-star review'. With that being said I'm going to give you the absolute truth. I don't know if everyone else had the same offer or not.I have had these pillows for a year. When you first get these pillows they are completely flat and rolled up and you have to let them decompress. I think the directions said to give the pillows several hours but I ended up waiting 24 hours just to be sure . The next day they were full, fluffy and soft. The material is very nice feeling but If you like firm pillows these are not for you. They are very fluffy. There is not much support at all. After using the pillows 2 months they became very worn out and lumpy and and they are not filled out and shaped anymore. Even though I don't give these pillows five stars and my review isn't very positive I still use them because they are very easy to shape. You can fold it in half very easily and that's what I usually do. plus I'm a stomach sleeper so sleeping on my stomach on this pillow works out really well since it's not firm at all. So with all this being said I don't personally recommend them for people who need a lot of support and firm pillows. Nor do I recommend it for someone who want them to stay in their normal shape. But if you don't care that much and you just need a pillow then go for it. I hope this helped out.",
