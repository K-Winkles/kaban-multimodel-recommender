                "reviewText": "The quickest way to get a \"crick\" in your neck is to get your shoulder up on your pillow as you sleep. This puts your neck vertebrae in a strain, and you'll wake up with a literal pain in the neck. This pillow cradles your head nice and is firm enough to resist your shoulders from getting on top of it. It's just the right firmness and is a good size pillow, so your head will stay on it when you change positions. It appears to be very well made, and it is most comfortable. I've used these types of pillows for years, and I've never experienced any neck pain while using them. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "After trying many memory foam pillows, this is my favorite! This is because 1. the density is great. Not too firm and not too soft- it has a nice give but doesn't continue to smoosh down. 2. The height is perfect. It's the right height for me (5'3\") but I could see it being good for a wide variety of heights. I personally prefer a taller pillow. Lastly, it has one big hump and a much smaller hump. Some pillows have two humps which pushes the top of your head and is not comfortable. A have a very sensitive neck, and am an exclusive side sleeper. Without a proper pillow, I often get a crimp in my neck. This one does the job at a good price.Bonus tip: if you like a slightly softer pillow, just remove the cover that it comes with and put on your own pillowcase. I find it makes it extra cushy, which I like!",

When I put my head on the pillow the foam sinks in, I wish there were thicker and more layers of foam within to be more firm. I like the height on both sides and it has helped me not have to keep adjusting my pillow so much when I'm trying to go to sleep so that is nice.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a Neck Pillow Contour Memory Foam Pillow for pain relief and better sleep. While it has its merits, I found it to be an average option that didn't quite meet my expectations.Firstly, the contour design of the pillow aims to provide support and relief for neck pain. It does offer some level of comfort and alignment for the neck and head, which can be beneficial for certain individuals. The memory foam material conforms to the shape of the neck, providing a customized fit.However, I found that the level of support provided by this pillow was not as firm or substantial as I had hoped. The memory foam seemed to lose its shape and support relatively quickly, requiring frequent adjustments throughout the night to maintain the desired positioning.Additionally, while the contour design is intended to cater to different sleep positions, I personally found it to be more suitable for back sleepers than for side or stomach sleepers. The shape and height of the pillow didn't align well with my preferred sleeping position, leading to discomfort and an inability to find a truly comfortable position.The pillow's quality was average, with the memory foam material being of decent quality but not outstanding. It retained some heat, which can be uncomfortable for those who tend to sleep hot. The cover material was acceptable, but it could have been softer and more breathable for added comfort.On a positive note, the pillow did offer some pain relief for my neck. However, I believe that individual preferences and needs can vary significantly when it comes to neck pillows, so what works for one person may not work as well for another.",

                "reviewText": "Before I go to bed, i always had to fluff/flatten/punch out my pillow because the stuffing is uncomfortable/too chunky or too flat on some areas, but with this pillow, i just lay down and close my eyes. Its been about 3 nights since i got it, and i had not had an uncomfortable sleep.The pillow is soft enough that it takes the shape of my head but firm enough that when i change positions, it springs back up and changes it shape again when i lay down. And the bump on one end of the pillow is not too high for my neck, im 5'1 135lbs for reference.I feel okay with it with side sleeping,It comes with a removable pillow case with zipper but i cover mines with a regular pillow case for ease of cleaning.Will recommend!!! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
