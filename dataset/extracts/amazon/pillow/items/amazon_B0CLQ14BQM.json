                "reviewText": "There was absolutely nothing to dislike about this. I have used others in the past, but they bulged in the wrong spot while never enabling you to set up comfortably as well as have side support.The only way I can describe it is it feels the way you do then you have someone sitting close behind you with their arms cuddled next to your side allowing you to comfortably rest on them or if you are into stuffed animals like I am, it\u2019s like being swaddled by a giant teddy bear. LolI ordered an extra one to give as a gift who is bedridden. I know she\u2019s gonna love it especially because it\u2019s like Goldilocks it\u2019s not too firm and it\u2019s not too soft. It\u2019s just right.Wedges are horrible since they are inflexible and make you sweat. There are some that remind me of a back of a beach chair, which is not conducive to actually comfortably sitting in bed.What is so funny is I can fall asleep sitting against this and not wake up achy which happens when I tried to bunch pillows together and fell asleep. I have a hard time sleeping anyway, but the craziest thing is as soon as I get in bed and use this I fall asleep within 25 minutes. So this not only is a great item to use for sitting in bed reading or using your laptop, but it also is fantastic if you fall asleep as well as help when you go to sleep, believe it or not.Kudos to the husband and wife who came up with this idea. Thank you thank you thank you. Also the material is just right.I will probably buy two more and put them in my bedroom closet for future use. I did forget to say this is perfect because I have a headboard that has a book shelf area across the entire bed where I place the books I am reading or will be reading, but it, makes sitting up in the bed uncomfortable.Buy it and you\u2019ll be happy that you did plus like I said it makes a fantastic gift for someone who is bedridden or recovering from surgery or an injury, requiring them to stay in bed. They will love you for it.",

                "reviewText": "I really appreciate the design allowing me to adjust the amount of padding inside in addition to being able to remove and wash the outer sleeve. The pockets are also a nice addition, although they are not very big; it can fit a phone pretty comfortably.I saw a complaint about it seeming overstuffed, but you could just remove some stuffing to your liking. I also saw some complain about inconsistency in stuffing amount when purchasing multiple. I can only speak for myself in that the stuffing is a perfect amount; so while I didn\u2019t need to try, there\u2019s an included paper noting that you can contact the manufacturer to request more stuffing if there isn\u2019t enough.",

                "reviewText": "I use this product for support like most people do. For me I thought it was added comfort for when sitting up in a bed or even a couch or a type of chair for reading or watching tv. Those couches, beds or some chairs that supports your sitting position but they do not necessarily have a lot of support in the right places for lumbar support (the lower back). It works though.The one I ordered came with a slight faint mildew like smell but its only on one arm of the pillow. I call it a mildew like smell because there is no sign or stain indicating that its mildew. I read that things like this and memory foam mattresses do this thing called off gassing where when used or just at random (probably due to temperatures and other environmental factors) a chemical smell will be released from within the foam inside the product. I don't think mine is off-gassing. Hopefully mine is the only one with this issue. with off gassing the smell usually dissipates. Mine just hasn't yet that's why I think its something else but there hasn't been any spills or any reason to cause the smell.The other thing I like but don't like if that makes sense is that the product guide that came with it ( a small paper pamphlet thingy) says that in time this product will get more comfortable (I remember reading the word softer). Mine has not. maybe I don't used it enough but it has kept its shape and it doesn't necessarily hinder my comfort when in use but it seems it still hasn't softened yet and all I need is for it to soften just a teensy weensy bit and it would be perfect for me. I think that maybe when it was made it was filled a little more than usual so its still on the firmer side which could be excellent for someone else.Some fun points (In my opinion or imo as the younger generations say/ text ): it came in a huge box... a product box not just the amazon box. its vacuum sealed. when you open it you have to shake it for 5 minutes as per the instructions in the product user pamphlet and it has pockets on both arms to store things like your phone, your remote, plug in headphones, a post it note pad will definitely fit inside. I use the pockets for headphones, hair ties and so I wont lose my earrings if I happen to not want to get up and put them away right when I take them off. So if you've read this far, don't take my review as a negative one.. this product has its good points, I think I could be just too picky at times. The fabric seems to be a stretch material and is soft to the touch. Just know it has worked for me as in served its purpose so far and there isn't any tears, or rips and my youngest has borrowed mine while virtual learning and asked for one of her own so that is a plus I guess. Other products I have seen in stores do not hold their shape are too soft so I wont serve well as for support on its own but this one so far is good. Now if only the makers could provide other colors or fabric choices or maybe covers to be more decorative that would be a huge plus too.",
