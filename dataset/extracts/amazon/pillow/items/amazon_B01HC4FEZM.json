This pillow was just the right height. Not to thick or to thin. And soft like your favorite pillow at your favorite hotel. If you have a king size bed, get the king size pillow. Every time I turn over my pillow is right their to catch me. And right back to sleep I go. I feel like this pillow helps me fall asleep faster. I am getting a better sleep now and I am not blaming my bed for it. It was my pillow.",

                "reviewText": "So I purchased the 2 pack of pillows about 10 days ago now. So I've been successfully using them for a solid week. I left them to \"fluff\" and \"breath\" for 24 hours before using them. So far so good.I split the set between my husband and myself. He isn't to picky about pillows, but recently had shoulder surgery. I asked him if he's noticed a difference before and after surgery. He says he has and that it's very supportive and soft on his shoulder area. He says they are nice pillows.I however am very picky about pillows. I suffer from health issues so my bed is my best friend and I need a good pillow. I don't get much sleep and suffer with chronic migraines as a small preview to health problems. Anyways, I could tell a difference the very night I used it and the following... now after 2 days I started with a migraine so I knew I'd be putting it to the test. It was supportive and did \"bounce\" back, however; not as I'd hoped like the 1st 2 nights of using it. It's still very good but I am hard on pillows and would rather have an extremely \"firm\" or filled pillow and be able to remove filling rather than have not enough. Now as I said I did split the set, so maybe the set together will be better. I am looking to order 2 more to test my theory.Overall, for the price for a set, it is comparable to a set of hotel premiere pillows, we've used from Sam's, in price for sure. And this reviews is in comparison to them. I do suggest opening and letting them \"rest\" and expand to proper size before use. Simply due to being vacuum sealed when sent. I hope keeping a set together will make it a 5 star but will update when received and if something changes.",

                "reviewText": "After years and years and decades of using the same ol' pillows...I After a long time, I figured that these (three) pillows have been flattened like pancakes and was maybe time to finally upgrade them and start using proper pillows with actual support (especially in the middle!). You wouldn\u2019t be able to tell from how the manufacturer packages these pillows \u2013 in plastic and vacuum packed, causing them to seem very thin and flimsy \u2013 but these pillows are as full, supporting, and \u201cplush\u201d feeling as you would imagine \u201cgel fiber filled\u201d! After unpacking it, and letting it slowly fluff to it\u2019s full size, once I was able to put my head and lay on it, my immediate thought was, \u201cI\u2019ve completely forgotten what a REAL pillow feels like!\u201ddecided to finally upgrade them; at some point, when you have to stack 2 or 3 very flat pillows, you start to feel that you might not be getting the head support that you might be needing...For better or worse, I'm one of those that fold my pillows to help prop my head up and/or mindlessly stuffs them in between my thighs when I'm on my side. But if you've ever \"abused\" your pillows like this, you'd know that this quickly flattens the heck out of standard pillows that all of the filling/\"fluff\" is pushed to the ends of the pillow and away from the middle where the support for the head is supposed to go. So, sometimes it's nice to have rather flat pillows when I have been propping my head up by folding them for hours on end; and I ended up learning to simply stack other flat pillows when I wanted to be propped up and/or not have my head flat. But, in the end, this is not how pillows are meant to be used. Enter these \"Sleep Restoration\" pillows...It feels real nice laying my head on this pillow; it\u2019s a real nice feeling where my head feels like it\u2019s floating in between completely flat on the mattress to propped up by multiple flat pillows. I haven\u2019t felt that in years!That feeling does come with some compromises though. Even though the Amazon description advertises that it is \u201ccooling\u201d and what not, it may be considered \u201ccooling\u201d compared to other Tempur-Pedic type materials, but it doesn\u2019t mean that laying on it for more than a couple minutes doesn\u2019t make it feel stuffier and later in the night hotter than without it. Also, as nice as it is laying with the back of your head on it, the \u201cgel fiber\u201d \u201cabsorption\u201d of the weight does not prop your head up enough when you lay on your side \u2013 which I do more than 50% of the night. Without enough support when you are sideways, your head hangs a bit uncomfortably and is made worse as the pillow fluffs in front of your face/mouth and it starts feeling a lot hotter than your old pillows (they don\u2019t have ANY fluff, so there\u2019s no fluff that is gathered and is pushed in front of your side-facing mouth).But, in the end, it is a real nice experience laying my head down on these pillows and really eye-opening after laying on flat ones over the years. There may be some quirks, but it isn\u2019t something that you can\u2019t figure out and have a pleasant lie down.",
