                "reviewText": "My husband is amazed at my ability to turn any pillow flat in a week. I like to side sleep, but I also love sleeping on my back sometimes also.Typically what i do to keep my head and neck properly propped up to avoid horrible headaches is I sort of shove it under my neck and between my shoulder. I find that way my neck is held up and I do not wake up with a horrible headache from sleeping wrong (oh the fun of ageing).With this pillow I do not have to do that at all, It properly supports my head and neck on both my side and back. I do notice that one side is slightly softer then the other. I am using a pillow case on my pillow but I do enjoy if I slide my hand in while sleeping or falling asleep that the outside of the pillow is SUPER cold. It is a very nice little surprise.I was unsure if this was going to work for me honestly but I was willing to give it a try. So far so good, and even after using this for a week its not flat yet and honestly hasn't changed shape at all. This pillow is worth every cent!",

                "reviewText": "I'd seen these pillows before and was unsure. You would think a cube pillow would be very uncomfortable, but if you're sleeping on your side, the corner of the cube fits nicely in that space between your neck and shoulder.When you open it, it does take a day or two for this thing to fully \"inflate\" (it comes sealed in a vacuum package) and fully off-gas. I'm also annoyed by the fact that a standard pillowcase doesn't really fit - it always slides off. You might want to find a pillow case with a zipper for this one.It's a memory foam pillow, so your head sinks into it nicely. Personally, I think it's a pretty high pile pillow ~3 inches or so. It's a little on the higher side for me, but not bad. This is really only good if you sleep on your side. If you sleep on your back it will be uncomfortable! If you try to use it as a cuddle pillow and put it in between your arms or legs, it will also be relatively uncomfortable. It doesn't squish well so if you're going to hold it in your arms when you sleep, it won't -squish-. It's firm as it's memory foam and meant for your head. The corners are also not great for a cuddle pillow either - I have found it's good strictly for side sleeping.It does sleep pretty cool, which is nice because you won't overheat as much. I really like this pillow, but I hate how small the use case is. It's only effective for THIS ONE THING -which is if you're a side sleeper. Since I tend to toss and turn, and I'm not always on my side, this isn't the right pillow for me, but I'm glad to have at least tried it. I think if you're struggling to find a pillow that works for you, and you're a side sleeper, I'd say try this.",

                "reviewText": "This pillow exceeded my expectations. Most cube/side sleeper pillows are really firm and stiff. This pillow is a very soft and impressionable memory foam. It supports my neck without being uncomfortable. I haven't been having my usual neck pains that I had with the pillow that I had bought from my chiropractor or regular store bought pillows. I've been using this pillow for about a week now and it's been an amazing improvement with my sleep and lounging experiences. It literally molds to my neck, head, and shoulders while still being supportive. It is incredibly soft both in feel and memory foam texture. It has a cooling effect that is an absolute dream for me. It feels very nice and stays cool through the night. If I reposition, the memory foam adjusts to the new impression I've made while it puffs back up to rid the old one. So, no matter if I toss and turn (due to my bad hip); I can find comfortable supportive in whatever my new position may be several times a night. This pillow has impressed me. It's quality made with nice materials. It has a great value for the price. I can, most certainly, recommend this!",
