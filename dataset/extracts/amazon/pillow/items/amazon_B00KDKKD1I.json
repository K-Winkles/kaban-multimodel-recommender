                "reviewText": "This is absolutely the best pillow, and the best COMPANY I have ever had the pleasure to do business with. In this day and age of computers, internet, and auto-responses, what a wonderful surprise it was to be able to contact the company and - not only get a timely response - but get a person within the company who could help me with all my needs SWIFTLY and courteously. I bought this pillow because I have a degenerative connective tissue disorder and I have to support my neck at all times - even when I'm sitting or lying down. But when I received it, although it was an awesome (hypoallergenic, soft, wonderful) pillow, it was just a little bit too fluffy for my needs. I contacted the company and asked about a special order, because I'd read where other customers had truly phenomenal experiences when contacting the company and asking for help. I sent a message here on Amazon and offered to buy a second pillow, but asked that it please be made to order with less fill.Instead of receiving an invoice or instructions on how to repurchase, I was sent another pillow, FREE OF CHARGE, made special-order to my specifications, with emails updating me throughout the entire process, and with a \"thank you\" note, personally signed and authored by Chris, at the Little Sleepy Head company headquarters, telling me he appreciated my business. Wow. You just don't get that ANYWHERE anymore. I have recently been fighting with my cable company, spending months and hours on the phone trying to get them to come out and fix their equipment, with NO relief, and I pay them $160 a month!!! You can't even get good customer service for something that runs 25% of your monthly mortgage each month, and yet - for a purchase that was relatively small with this pillow here - I received the best customer service I've ever had in my entire life.I am in the process of placing another order for my daughter - and will do so again for all of my pillow needs for the rest of my life. Please be advised, if you purchase this item, you will get the best, most personalized customer service available in the world market today. Hands-down, the BEST!!!As far as the product goes, both the original pillow and the special order pillow are so awesome. They are AS COMFORTABLE and AS SOFT and yet SUPPORTIVE as my 100% Down Pillow (which cost three times as much). This pillow is awesome for adults (as well as children), providing just the right amount of support and cushion. You can absolutely tell that it's hypoallergenic, and that it hasn't been doused with heavy chemicals. It is the ONLY pillow you'd need for travel, for sleep, for chillin' on the couch. Extremely portable (you can shove it into a large purse if you're traveling with it), and perfect for daily use, I could not rate this pillow any higher as the best toddler/child/adult pillow on the market today.The cover is breathable and soft, and it is truly a joy to use. You can't go wrong!AAA+++",

He tends to fall off of it when he\u2019s sleeping (I think it\u2019s because of the bulkiness). But ultimately it\u2019s a good pillow and my son sleeps well with it.",

There is another version that is 3\u201d high. Corresponded with owners to double-check heights and they couldn't have been more helpful and gracious. They also have cute little 100% cotton pillowcases.(Needless to say from the review that it is an adult using this product and not a toddler.)",
