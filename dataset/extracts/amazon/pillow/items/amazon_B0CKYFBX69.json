It does have a bit of a chemical smell at first, just like EVERY new foam product does. It goes away by the time the pillow finishes fluffing up. I left it out for 2 days and it is very thick. A smaller person may not like it because it is quite tall and thick around, it has some weight to it from the filling. We have purchased two now and we really like them!",

                "reviewText": "This is a review for HOXXME Body Pillow for Adults Shredded Memory Foam Long Full Body Pillow for Sleeping with Breathable Bamboo Cover Firm Hug Large Pillows for Side Sleepers 20x54When I opened the pillow from the package, it was super flat, but I left it out for a week now, and it has expanded pretty good, but could use a lot more filling. If you grab the pillow by the end, and let all the stuffing settle, there is a good chunk of loose fabric in your hand. In order for this to be comfortable, I will have to fold the fabric over, and stuff the pillow in another case.I am not sure if this is normal for body pillows these days, but I did expect it to be more full.",

                "reviewText": "So I have bought the exact same pillow, not this one, from Wally World for years. Even after it has caused me pain in my neck, I still have bought the same one. Seeing these pillows I figured there would be no great loss in trying them out. Oh my was I surprised.First of all, remember to follow the instructions and allow the pillow to settle itself back into shape. I actually gave it a couple days and not saying that extra day made a difference, but not saying it didn't either.I was concerned as to me the pillow felt hard, but it really isn't. Once I put my head down on it you could feel that it is actually soft, but not overly soft. Compared to the pillows I have used before, and there have been several, these compare to the ones that were given to me when I stayed in a high priced hotel once.While they are listed as king size, they are very thick so you will need a really large pillow case, maybe made for thick king size pillows. If you stuff it into a regular king size pillow case you're probably not going to be getting the full effect of the pillow. I say this as I don't have anything but standard king size pillow cases and using one of them, as to compared to not using a pillow case at all, the is some difference in the feel of the pillow. It feels a bit softer when it is not jammed into the undersized pillow case. I am going to find a good pillow case to put it in as well as some rough feeling case isn't going to do me any favors either.I have only slept on this pillow a few times as of this writing, but I haven't woke up in pain like I would with my other pillows. Is this going to eliminate all my neck pain, probably not as some of it comes from arthritis in my neck, but with any luck it might just help lessen it a bit.I have high hopes for this pillow and can't wait to get some more time using it.",

                "reviewText": "It's been a long time since I've had a body pillow, and I've never had memory foam, so I thought this would be a great addition to my bed. It took a long time to fully expand from being vacuum sealed (2-3 days), but it had a good amount of firmness and softness when it did. I tried to put an old body pillow cover on this pillow, but it was for a standard size and didn't fit this one, so I'm led to believe that this one is a little bit larger than what would be considered standard. However, using two king-sized pillowcases on either end was fine because they fit and matched my bedding.",
