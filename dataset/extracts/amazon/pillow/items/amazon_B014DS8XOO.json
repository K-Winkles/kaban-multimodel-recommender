                "reviewText": "Previously, I gave it a 3 star cos the pillow doesnt seem to fluff up much and seemed alittle bit too flat. Plus it sinks abit too much when i rest my head on it. So I felt like it did not suit me.Then I tried 'slapping' the pillows at the longitudinal ends towards the middle/ pushing the fluffy content of the pillow towards its core for a couple of times. Upon doing so, the pillow seems to be fluffier and doesnt seem to sink as much. Problem seemed to be solved but let's see how it performs in the next few days! So future customers, if your pillow feels abit too flat, try 'massaging' the pillow to properly distribute the fluff after unrolling it.Nonetheless, goods aside, I felt that linenspa has a great customer support team. They are always reaching out to customers who feel unsatisfied and wanting to make it up to them. Really appreciate such gestures.1st week: it was bad. it sinks alot2nd to 4th week for now: after fluffing it towards the middle, it doesnt sink as much. my sleep was great.",

It's very soft and squishy despite looking so filled, and I was looking forward to sleep on it- until I tried getting comfortable that is. My head sunk in it almost completely, it felt like it almost became level with my mattress!! I tried fluffing it and molding the shape- I even tried sleeping flat on my back (I'm usually a side sleeper, but can do flat back sleeping from time to time) just to somehow make it work and give me at least some support for my head/neck, but to no avail. I wound up propping it up with another pillow behind it to create a slope and somehow passed out eventually. It's a shame- I really wanted it to work. I'm gona keep it as an extra pillow to decorate the bed with or when I hang out/sit on my bed and need some extra comfort.",

Did not want something real expensive yet I didn't want one so cheap it would get lumpy after one night's sleep. This pillow was in my price range and it was polyester fill. So I took a chance and only bought one just to see how it would do. Let me tell ya I was impressed with the stitching and how it bounced right back up upon applying pressure. The real test came after I had slept on it. Yep it's a keeper. Turned right around and bought the 2nd one for my bed. Wonderful pillows. I highly recommend them. I am real picky about pillows. I know they will last a long time. Couldn't be happier. They conform to my sleeping needs. I crunch my pillow under my head. Worried the fill would shift. Nope it stayed in place and bounced right back. Enough said. Would buy again. Fast shipping to boot!",

I washed it immediately after it arrived and accidentally put it in the dryer on high heat. When I got the pillow out of the dryer, it was still fluffy, soft, and un damaged. My daughter has slept on it for a week now and seems very comfortable when laying on it. I was so impressed, I just ordered two more for my son\u2019s bed and I am contemplating ordering two king size pillows. This is a good pillow for the price. I honestly expected less.",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a pillow after unsuccessfully buying \"the most-comfortable\" and \"help you sleep soundly\" kinds. After a few months, these pillows resembled lumpy oatmeal. When searching through Amazon, I saw this pillow and figured I would give it a try. The reviews (as many on Amazon do) range from \"it's great\" to \"it's terrible.\" After two weeks of use, the WEEKENDER pillow still is comfortable and supports my head. When it arrived it is vacuum-sealed, so it appears crushed. After opening it, the pillow expanded. I decided to shake it a bit just to open it further. I used the pillow the same day. If you are reading this review and seeing it's after two weeks from my purchase, I'd understand your skepticism. I'll update in a month to provide a further review.",

                "reviewText": "Its hard to find a good pillow anymore. I should know, I have about 10 of them and none of them are comfortable.. They are mostly foam or gel and I just can't get comfortable with them. Most of them cost around $80.00 and I still wake up with a very sore neck. When I saw the weekender Down alternative pillow and so many positive reviews I thought \" what the heck\" I'll try it, figuring that with the low price, I would probably end up sending it to the recycle bin. WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE. I really do love this pillow. Not to hard or to soft. IT'S PERFECT. It is just like the feather pillows my granny had, without the feathers poking me. You can also squash this pillow, which I love. I highly recommend this pillow and I will be purchasing more in the near future.",
