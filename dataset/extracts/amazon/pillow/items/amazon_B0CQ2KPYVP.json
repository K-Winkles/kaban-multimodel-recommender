Mine has a gusset with two stripes of navy-colored piping going around the perimeter, like in some of the customer photos.) I let mine air out for a few days (even though there was no odor) and didn't bother doing the dryer fluff. On the negative side, it seems like this pillow is a tad longer than all the other pillows I've used -- it sticks out of my pillow case, which is a bit annoying. However, I've been sleeping great on it, so I'll just have to sew up some custom sized cases for this one, lol. It's somewhat dense, but not at all hard on the head, and is nicely, evenly fluffy. For me personally, it would be absolutely perfect if it were an inch less thick, but I'm still extremely happy with it. Too often you try out a new pillow and it's just unusable. I'm thrilled this one wasn't just usable, but very comfortable! I'm a bit mystified about the change in product photos, though. If I wanted to buy another one to complete the pair, it seems like I would get a different pillow...",

                "reviewText": "As someone who sits at a desk for long periods every day, I have very high requirements for pillows. In the past, I always had to face a reality: either the pillow was too hard or too soft, resulting in insufficient support for my neck. Over time, I easily felt fatigued and uncomfortable. However, I recently purchased a down alternative queen pillow that has completely changed my sleeping experience.First of all, the design of this down alternative queen pillow is very user-friendly and the perfect size for my head and neck. It is made of a new type of breathable material that keeps me fresh while sleeping and does not make me feel stuffy like traditional pillows. Secondly, it feels great to the touch, as soft as down and skin-friendly, making people feel its comfort as soon as they touch it. What's more worth mentioning is that this pillow has the perfect balance of breathability and softness. It neither lacks support like some hard pillows nor makes people feel uncomfortable like some overly soft pillows.",

                "reviewText": "The pillow came rolled up in a vacuum-sealed bag. After opening the bag and letting the pillow sit for a few hours it regained its shape and was a thick fluffy pillow. It's replaced my older and thinner pillow and I've been loving it. So far the pillow hasn't lost any of its fluff and seems to be well-made, especially for the price.Overall a great option if you like a well-padded and slightly soft pillow. It's not so soft that your head practically touches the mattress, but If you need a firm pillow for neck support this might be a bit too soft.",

It has a smooth surface, and it has great texture to provide support to my neck. I feel much better sleeping on this new pillow, and I think I deserve a nice pillow like this one since I spend at least 7 hours a day sleeping on it.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect of this pillow, as I'd never ordered pillows online. This pillow arrived packed and compressed into a cylinder. Once removed from its airtight plastic container it began to expand. Within 10 minutes it was almost fully expanded (see photos). I was thrilled to discover that the pillow is absolutely perfect for my sleeping taste. It is soft without being mushy. It is thick enough that your head feels as though it is floating on air, yet not so firm that your neck will be sore. I am a side sleeper and this pillow works perfectly for me. Two thumbs way up!",

                "reviewText": "I'm a bit of a pillow connoisseur. I have over 30+ pillows throughout my house in different bedrooms and places. I love to have the ability to grab something soft and comfortable no matter where I am in the house and be able to relax or snuggle. I typically get premium down pillows but they do cost more, and some people are not crazy about natural down/feathers.I got this pillow as a sample. It arrived in shrink / vacuum packed plastic and opened up fully within minutes of releasing it from the plastic. The pillow seems to be well made (seam stitching) and overall material. I'm not sure what is inside (you cannot open the pillow to see)..........but the external material is sleek and comfortable.The pillow is comfortable, kind of an in-between between hard and soft and the internal fluff (i'm assuming little foam pieces) are adjustable. Meaning they can potentially lump up in one area of the pillow if you dont fluff it.Overall for $15 bucks this is a good bargain and a comfortable pillow.It does have a bit of a chemical odor at first, but not as bad as some others i've seen.for $15 this is a good buy.",

They have a good amount of stuffing inside that I almost wonder if it'd spread out even more after a wash dry because they are actually quite a bit more dense and heavy on the stuffing compared to some other polyfill I have. You can feel it inside and feel that you can really spread it out a lot more if you wanted/ give it some air.These 20x30 queen pillows are working out nicely on my 21\"x27\" shams! Puffy as you'd like & I'm satisfied :)",
