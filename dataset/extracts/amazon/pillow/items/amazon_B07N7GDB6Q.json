                "reviewText": "I purchased the 26 inch set, with intentions to use them as sitting cushions. I expected them to be as firm as the 18 inch set I previously bought; however, they feel more like soft bed pillows--rather than throw pillows. They seem to be well made--nonetheless. I'll see how they hold up. I guess it depends on how you want to use them. P.S. it's amazing to see them decompress so quickly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these pillows to replace the innards of two older pillow cases that were starting to flatten. They are 20 x 20 and even though I ordered this pair as 22 x 22 hoping to bulge the filling somewhat, the pillows were no thicker. They were very comfortable feeling but not the extra support hoped for. They product description didn't really say anything about firmness. I was going off their photos and many of the images showed pillows sort of bulging, so I was hoping that's what would arrive. I ended up squeezing both new inserts into a single cover, and that got me very close to what I wanted. Otherwise, these arrive fast and feel nice, almost down-pillow-like.",

Great price and fast delivery! They have lots of different sizes so I will definitely be ordering more for my smaller pillow covers!",
