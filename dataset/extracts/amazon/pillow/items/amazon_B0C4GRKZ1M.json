Just couldn't sleep otherwise. This pillow is perfect. It's soft and yet still has the roll to raise my head or neck a little. Haven't washed the cover. I can see that it might be difficult to get in or out of the cover because the zipper doesn't go all the way. Can't say it's a concern. Speaking of concerns...I saw a few reviews that mentioned the smell of the pillow. Mine was as fresh as could be.",

It\u2019s a cheap imitation - foam is very soft, raised section is pretty flat and the pillow is much smaller - by several inches! Is this a difference between states?",

This pillow is really good, it is essentially the same as my old pillow, packaged well and keeps my head and body at the same level where there are little to no neck pain/cramps!I would have to say, it is a little too firm for my liking, but Im not too worried about that, It will either soften up overtime or I will get use to it.If that is a big worry for you, I would suggest look for another pillow.But if you are the type to love firm pillows, this product is perfect for you!Not much else to say but is a pillow and does its basic job!",
