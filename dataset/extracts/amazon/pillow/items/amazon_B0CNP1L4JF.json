I was concerned about these pillows for the quantity and price but decided to let the reviews speak and took a chance. These pillows are fluffy and luxurious. As soon as you open the package they begin to expand and once they expand they are so comfortable and soft while still offering great support. Where before we had to stack 2 pillows under our head, with these we only need one now and we use the extra for body pillows. This product is EXCELLENT value for the price and deserves nothing less than 5 stars. If you are looking to change our pillows in your home and are seeking the most bang for your buck look no further.",
