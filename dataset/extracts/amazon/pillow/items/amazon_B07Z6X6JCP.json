                "reviewText": "The last 2 years have spent a small fortune on every brand /type of pillow imaginable including feather pillows, shredded memory foam pillows, and bamboo. Im a side sleeper and had neck fusion surgery 2016 and lower back surgery. This pillow is amazing at a great price point. It is soft to touch but can squeezeble therefore firm yet it conforma to your neck and head keeping your back aligned with your neck when sleeping. Has worked wonders for my migraines also. I have not had any issues with the pillow being hot as some reviews state and I sleep.hot in general. However I do use a bliss silk pillowcase so perhaps that makes a difference in temperature control. I Have spent way more pillows that did not have the same level.of comfort. It's well made and the cover can be removed to be washed. So happy I purchased for my son and DIL as they kept saying they needed good pillows and they love them. My grandson. Plays a lot of sports and asked for one too. My daughter even replaces all pillows in her home with this one. Hope my this review was helpful to some.of you :)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This pillow is the best I\u2019ve tried in years. I have struggled to find the perfect pillow with the right amount of support without being too stiff or too soft, or needing fluffed through the night. I\u2019ve tried cheap to expensive ones, from solid inserts to shredded material of all kinds, and this is honestly the best pillow for me. It\u2019s not like normal dense-memory foam, and responds quickly. Firm, but not hard or too stiff. It also bounces back to its shape fast after lifting my head off it. I would describe this almost as a cross between a latex and a true memory foam pillow. Just the right amount of give and support. It conforms to my head great, and I don\u2019t feel like I sink in and get \u2018stuck\u2019 like the traditional memory foam pillows. As a combo side and back sleeper on a plush-hybrid mattress, it\u2019s the perfect loft height. No neck or back aches anymore waking up!I\u2019m a hot sleeper but did not have any issues with it feeling warm or needing to flip it during the night. But I do also have a cooling pillow protector and a breathable cotton case on it. The video is without my own pillow covers on. Feels good quality. Zero smell out of the box.I will be getting more of these for the spare bedroom bed!",

                "reviewText": "After sleeping on this pillow for a couple of months now, I can say that it definitely supports your neck if you sleep on your side.Although it takes some time for your head to sink in, it conforms to your head and supports it nicely. It isn\u2019t too soft, but it isn\u2019t super hard either as I don\u2019t have to fight it to get my head positioned.I don\u2019t stay on one side throughout the night and would consider myself a \u201croller\u201d since I roll from one side, to my back, and then to the other side and vice versa throughout the night. This pillow is great for side sleeping, but it probably isn\u2019t ideal for back sleepers. The pillow is just firm enough to fill the shoulder gap for side sleepers, but slightly too firm to be comfortable when sleeping on your back.As for the pillow itself, it\u2019s foam with a removable pillow covering like any other pillow. You can wash the covering if you stain it. The foam is memory foam and relatively cool because it\u2019s made with a grid of holes in the material to promote airflow and temperature regulation.Overall, I\u2019m happy with this pillow and it supports my side very well. The material is the perfect combination of soft and firm. Temperature has never been an issue to me, either. I recommend this pillow if you\u2019re a side sleeper!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my 10+ year old molded memory foam pillow that was perfect for all these years but had started to lose its firmness (it still holds its shape perfectly, tough). A Flex driver brought it in the night for same-day delivery. Anyway, I slept soooooo good last night with this pillow. When I went to bed, I still had lingering pain in my neck and head from the other temporary pillow I was using, which was a horrible pillow. When I woke up, something about having slept on this pillow all night made it so I could massage out the kinks that were causing the pain and now the pain is gone. I feel normal again.There are a lot of mixed reviews on this pillow with some saying it's too firm and others saying it's too soft. The thing is, it's actually both firm and soft. It's a little firmer when it's new just like any other memory foam sleep product, and it's just teetering on the edge of too firm for me out of the box. This tells me that once it's broken in, it'll be perfect.I found this to be absolutely perfect -- heavenly even -- when sleeping on my side. It feels like my head is properly supported in a straight position rather than being up or down. When it comes to lying on my back, this pillow does have my head just a little elevated, but again I think once it's broken in, it will be perfect for both back and side sleeping.Sure, it's only been one night with it but I feel like this is a great pillow -- a giant upgrade over the crappy temporary pillow, and regained the feeling my old molded memory foam pillow had before it started to finally wear out.I sure hope this one lasts just as long as my old one...I love it already!",

This is a better choice for sleepers that like to sink into their pillow and have it mold to their head. However, after the pillow sinks and settles it becomes very flat and unsupportive to the neck and head. Not great for side sleepers, you feel the need for a second pillow. It\u2019s soft and feels comfy at first, may be great for someone else! My boyfriend did decide to return after one use.",
