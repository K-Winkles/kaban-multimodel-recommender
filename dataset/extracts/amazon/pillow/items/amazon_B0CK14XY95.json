                "reviewText": "I had a fairly plump pillow before I bought this but I would still wake up with an occasional pain in my neck and shoulders. Bought this pillow and I no longer have pain in the mornings. I was even having issues sleeping on my side but this pillow is thick enough to make it extremely comfortable for your side sleeping nights. Soft pillow but firm enough that it is extremely comfortable and contours to you. The pillow has different features. One side has a contour to cradle your head while the other flipped side is more flatter. And one end of the pillow is higher than the other end so you get to choose which side is best for your neck. I personally enjoy the thicker end since it contours your neck very well. It's very comfortable and honestly I think it has helped with eliminating my snoring as well. Only downside of this pillow is the pillowcase. It comes with a pillowcase but it has a built in zipper that's very finicky and can get stuck so I just bought a separate pillowcase for easy washing. It tends to slip out of the case often because of the material of the pillow but I'll deal with it. Overall very satisfied and would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "(Written from the perspective of my granddaughter-in-law) I am 5'1\" (about 155 cm), primarily a back and side sleeper, who gets really warm at night and has been dealing with a lot of neck and shoulder pain, as well as breathing issues in my sleep causing snoring, interrupted sleep, and morning headaches. This pillow is not a substitute for medical intervention, but for the past few nights that I have used it, it has accomplished every task it set out to do quite well.I have only used the shorter side (I think the other side would be too high for my head and neck), but it is very comfortable to lay on, soft while firm and supportive enough to keep my head and neck positioned properly throughout the night. Because my head and neck are finally kept at an appropriate position while I sleep, my pain is noticeably reduced (not gone, but it has only been a few nights and I would also benefit from other habits), and my breathing and sleeping are better.While the place where your head is on the cover will warm, the rest of it stays cool and when you move, the cover cools back down quickly as well. The pillow itself also doesn't have any off or chemical smell, so there was no need to air it out before I could use it. The cover is easy to remove, replace, and wash (which you should always do first when you get a new pillow, to disinfect it).One comment I do have is I believe taller people might find the pillow to be lacking in height or support, but for my needs and experience, I am greatly enjoying this pillow and recommend it to you if anything in my review sounds appealing or relevant! I will update this should anything change.",

The contoured memory foam provides a snug and firm support for my neck and head which enables me to sleep through the night without waking up due to the discomfort of misalignment of my neck vertibrae. The entire pillow was constructed of high quality materials and it keeps its shape day in and day out. I have never gone back to regular shape pillows once I tried contour pillows years ago, and I have purchased many. This is a very well constructed pillow of high quality.
