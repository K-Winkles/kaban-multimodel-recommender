                "reviewText": "We have purchased this line of bedding going on seven years for multiple beds in multiple sizes and don't intend on switching to anything different.These sheets feel far softer and better quality than their price would indicate- I'd go so far as to say that they feel like a luxury brand for a tiny percentage of the cost. I love that there are so many options in color and design that we've been able to purchase and switch out over the years.The only (very minor) downside is the elastic in the fitted sheets does sometimes wear out quicker than other brands, but for the quality and price that's a downside I'll gladly take.",

                "reviewText": "These sheets are amazing, so soft and comfy. Do not wrinkle, even if you forget to take them out of dryer right away. Once you put them on the bed they smooth out. They fit my mattress perfectly. Easy to figure out which side is long side and which is short side. I sleep hot and since I bought these sheets, I have not had that problem. They also stay put once they are on the bed. And best quality sheets I have ever purchased for an affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "My guest room went from \"blah\" to \"bam!\" thanks to these Amazon Basics sheets. I snagged the bright white set for the queen bed, and let me tell you, they instantly brightened up the whole space. They're seriously soft \u2013 like, sink-right-in kind of soft \u2013 and feel super high quality without breaking the bank. Plus, the 14-inch pockets? No more sheet-wrestling with my thick mattress! But the best part? These sheets are total lifesavers when it comes to laundry. They're machine-washable and dry like a dream, so keeping them fresh for guests (or, ahem, myself) is a breeze. And bonus points for being breathable \u2013 they're perfect for year-round use, no matter the season. If you're looking for affordable sheets that'll make your bed the coziest spot in the house (or guest room!), definitely check these out. They're a total win in my book!",

Se lavan muy bien y no queda dura ni hacen bolas. Las arrugas son pocas y pasan desapercibidas. Las compr\u00e9 como una alternativa para las visitas, de buen precio, que no ocupen mucho espacio, y que fueran f\u00e1ciles de lavar. Pues me encantaron hasta para m\u00ed misma! 100/100!",
