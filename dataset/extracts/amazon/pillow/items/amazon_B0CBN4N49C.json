After allowing the pillow to air out a few days, I started sleeping on it.The thickness is perfect for me - most memory foam pillows that I have tried previously are too thick (or rigid) and hurt my neck. It has the right amount of \u201csquish\u201d and provides support while still molding to my head/neck.I slept on the Three Mares pillow for 4 nights beautifully! On the 5th night, I slept on my old pillow just for comparison. After using my old pillow, I woke up with a crick in my neck! I immediately switched back to the Three Mares pillow the following night and my neck felt so much better the next morning.

It was overall a good pillow.I normally do not know the dimensions of the pillows that I buy as I only look at \"Queen\", \"King\" and sizes like that. The 27in one(the largest one that they have on amazon) is the same size as my queen just in case anyone was wondering.The cover on the pillow was nice and the zipper was very small which was also nice as sometimes the zipper is so big that I can feel it when I am using the pillow.Useability: Very easy. Pull it out and let it relax for a while to get to it's full \"fluffiness\". I left mine out for about 4 hours. There is no smell which is very nice and some memory foam can have a very chemical smell.I did take one star off as it seemed a little thinner then what I was expecting in a normal pillow and I wished that they would have listed the pillow sizes in the normal \"Queen\", \"King\" sizes instead of actuial dimensions.",

                "reviewText": "I got this pillow because I have a hard time sleeping due to my current pillows being too hard or too soft. This pillow is just wright as the memory foam does a good job adapting to your head and neck. The pillow arrived in a vacuum bag and once opened it starts to fluff up. I let the pillow sit for about 15 hours prior to using it just to be sure it relaxed to its normal form. After using this pillow just shy of 2 months I can definitely say that I have no complaints. The memory foam expands to its normal shape every time you move around on the pillow which doesn\u2019t leave room for flat or hard surfaces. This pillow also stays cool and does not absorb body heat which is also nice. I tend to sleep a lot on my side and the comfort this pillow provides between my arm and face are just great. I almost have up on foam pillows until I got the three mares pillow. It\u2019s well worth the asking price.Pros-SoftComfortableFluffyCoolCons-N/A",
