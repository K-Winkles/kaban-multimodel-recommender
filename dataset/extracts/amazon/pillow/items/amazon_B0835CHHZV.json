Very expensive ones that were over $100 each to affordable. These pillows are affordable and provide an excellent nights sleep! You can\u2019t beat the price! I\u2019ve had $100 pillows hurt my neck and give me a headache within 4 days. I\u2019ve used one of these for a week and no pain! You do have to fluff them up a bit every morning when you make your bed. I put it in the dryer on low just in case of bed bugs and I do this with all bedding I buy. Fluffed up great, not too much loftiness or too flat. It\u2019s basically perfectly affordable and comfortable! I will purchase a new set when it\u2019s time.",

                "reviewText": "I had a memory foam pellet like filling pillow. It's supposed to give support, yet be soft. I found that the small memory foam pieces was quite firm and only compressed so much so ended up feeling harder then normal. So i wanted to go back to a normal pillow, so when i read this is a down alternative pillow, i decided to try it. I had a down pillow that was really soft and this was similar in that it does feel soft and compresses much more when you want it to compress and that makes all the difference. Anyways, it does feel comfortable and i use the stiffer pillows now as a back brace when reading. Anyways, good pillow for sleeping, it's what i'm used to.",

                "reviewText": "This will be a brief review of my pillow journey. I tried a few of the most popular pillows, like MyPillow, Amazon Basics, bamboo/shredded foam, memory pillows, but my most common complaint about them were that they were all just too high and firm for me. I am a restless sleeper and alternate between back, side, and stomach sleeping, and I strongly preferred the stomach sleeper/flat pillows with a polyester fiber/down alternative filling.Here's a ranking of my 4 top pillows:Eversnug Adjustable Layer Pillows - (#1)These were THE pillow for me. I had never heard of these pillows or the company, but I really like being able to adjust my pillow. These pillows came with 2 small, 2 medium, and 2 large pillows and 2 twin zippable pillow pouches. All of them were polyester fiber filled and somewhat flat and soft, but not lumpy. The pillows may not come the exact same sizes, but they are close enough for me. These are the pillows I ultimately decided to stick with, despite being slightly more expensive than the others at $50 for a set of 2 pillows.Nappler Bamboo Shredded Memory Foam Pillow - (#2)Before I found the Eversnug pillows, I was trying the adjustable bamboo shredded memory foam ones. These were my go-to whenever I was testing pillows I didn't like very much. The only downside to these pillows is that if you don't add enough filling, you could feel the edges of the shredded foam. Also, the \"bamboo\" cover was way too warm and the inner zipper would get too easily caught.Amazon Basics Down Alternative Pillow - (#3)I don't think I've ever been disappointed by an Amazon Basics product yet. These pillows were soft, amazing pillows, but they were 1-2 inches too thick/firm for me.MyPillow - (#4)Despite all the hype around these, they were too lumpy and 1 inch too thick for me.Like I said previously, I ended up going with the Eversnug Adjustable pillows, which I absolutely adore. A tiny bonus is that you can take the pillows you don't use and rest them on your sides or between your knees for some extra cushioning.",

                "reviewText": "There is one supreme pillow on the earth\u2026and this, my friends, is NOT it! I do agree with the other reviewers that these pillows are very soft (to the touch, but not in firmness.) These feel great, fluff up nicely and provide a comfy support. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not ALL I\u2019m looking for in a pillow. I want more!These are not good for me. I\u2019m a side sleeper, and after sleeping on this pillow, I woke up many times through the night, to adjust my position. My neck and back ached through the last few hours of my sleep, until finally, I had to get out of bed. Not great, right? Nope.Like I said, there is one supreme pillow brand, that reigns above them all, and those are the ones found at Hampton Inn Hotels. I thought that perhaps, these might come close, (based on so many positive reviews) but boy was I wrong. These are way too firm for me (even though they are labeled as \u201csoft.\u201d So I will be returning these, and buying my pillows directly from the shop Hampton site (something I didn\u2019t even know was possible until today.) After trying another hotel brand, then MyPillow, and now these, I\u2019m not messing around any more. I\u2019m going to pay for comfort and peaceful sleep! These are being returned tomorrow.",
