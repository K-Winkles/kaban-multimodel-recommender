                "reviewText": "I'm not exaggerating when I say I have been looking for a pillow for months now. My favorite pillow I probably had for 20 years I finally had to get rid of due to neck pain. I didn't realize finding a new one would be so difficult. Every new pillow I ordered and tried eithier wasn't comfortable or I would wake up with neck pain. I did find one from my chiropractor that worked but wasn't my favorite in the world. But at least I wasn't waking up with neck pain during my search. Also was getting frustrated with some places requiring return fees or shipping fees to return them.I was reading online reviews and someone did a test of different ones for side sleepers and recommended this. This was my first \"adjustable\" pillow I got. The inside padding seemed pretty good quality and after 2 nights, I am in love. I'm a side sleeper and still need support, but don't want my head to be turned up too much, or have that bump that so many pillow have in my neck. Super not comfortable. I also didn't like ones where your head has to stay in the middle of the pillow the whole time as I do toss at night or like to find the cool spot of the pillow.I have to admit once it unraveled and fluffed up, I probably took out half of the memory foam inside. But for the first time in what seems like months, I'm excited to lay on a pillow again. It's flat like I like it, and firm, but just squishy enough so not like sleeping on a board and can hold. My wife thinks it's too firm for her but she likes to sleep on super squishy pillows.The one very minor critique is the first night it seemed to get a little warm, but I just put a cooling pillow case over it and all fixed. Last night I feel alseep so fast and woke up with no back or neck pain. Finally!!! Very Happy with this pillow.",

I did however had to take out plenty of the foam inside to get it to where is was comfortable to me. After removing the foams, omg, when I laid my head on the pillow it was so comfortable, and soft but still firm. I am very happy with my Saybrook pillow. I highly recommend it. It is an amazing pillow, you just have to be patient and get it to where you want it to be to get it comfortable for you. Thanks Saybrook for a wonderful pillow.",

                "reviewText": "So far I\u2019ve had this pillow for about a week. I had to remove a good amount of the filling. I stuffed the round cylinder container full. The pillow is firm with enough softness to support my head. I sleep on my side and back. The biggest issue is getting the pillow out of the cylinder zip package. I managed to get it off after struggling but I think it would be difficult for an older person to open. You can\u2019t cut the package off or you\u2019ve damaged your container to store the filling you remove. You could also cut the pillow. They should change that. It was a ridiculous amount of effort. The bamboo cover is very nice. I was going to use pillow covers but don\u2019t need them with this pillow.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this pillow because I was consistently having neck pain with my old, down pillows. After using this pillow, for the first time in several years, I woke up pain-free. I chose the king size. What I found, was that the pillow was stuffed to the gills. I took an old, zippered, standard-sized pillowcase, and filled it with leftovers. I now have two amazing pillows!I recommend purchasing Sureguard waterproof pillowcase covers if there\u2019s any chance something might be spilled on your pillow. The pillow filling cannot be laundered. But, it\u2019s so good at what it does \u2013 supporting your neck \u2013 that the pillow is worth it, and, if you protect it, you will never have to worry about laundering it.",

                "reviewText": "First memory foam pillow I\u2019ve owned after countless standard pillows. I am extremely hard on pillows, I wear out and replace at a 3:1 ratio vs my wife. I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and 230 pounds, a side sleeper primarily but am in all positions of sleeping every night. I need a lot of loft in a pillow so 80 percent of the pillows sold in stores are disqualified for being flat when new. Read reviews of Coop, Saatva, Squishy Pillow, Layr, countless others along with down pillows and ultimately 20 plus articles on pillows. I decided to give this one a try based on the quality of the foam vs others and I will say that it appears to be of high quality and is very consistent without any other filler or irregularities in size . I have not removed any filler at all, this pillow is soft with plenty of loft for anyone and has maybe 10% or less \u201ctoo much\u201d loft for me but I figured after a month it will be perfect so I left it alone and I was right. The good is it\u2019s holding up well and has great softness and support as you go to sleep and sleeps very cool. The bad is this memory foam pillow definitely has a memory and once you are sleeping it continues to sink well beyond a minimum loft for me. I find myself flipping the pillow in the middle of the night to the non compressed side to regain loft and go back to sleep, my neck is hurting at this time. I awake in the morning with the pillow again compressed and neck hurting, this pain is continuing into the morning of each day for a period of hours. I have never had neck pain, ever, only back pain. It\u2019s very hard to show in a picture the pillow compression but it\u2019s a lot and if you don\u2019t touch the pillow in the morning when you go to bed that night it will be exactly as you left it that morning, compressed. These pictures are taken day and night both and obviously with a heavy head placed it\u2019s worse than the picture. Sadly this pillow cannot make it through the night giving support, you fluff the pillow and it\u2019s good for another period of time but will fade well before morning. Daily neck pain and fading support in a few hours reflects my 3 star review. It will outlast a standard fiber filled pillow no doubt, has plenty of fill and is soft but falls short of a full night sleep. Maybe a smaller back or stomach sleeper will have better luck but expect support to fade hour by hour until flipped or fluffed.",
