There is enough feathers to be able to mold to how you see fit.I have yet to get over heated using this pillows.I use a t-shirt style pillow case and have yet to lose any feathers.Overall, these pillows are wonderful and if I ever need to buy another set, I will strongly consider these.",

This pillow adjusts well it doesn't lift my head up too high and I can tell it will even get better in time good quality to ! To give you an idea of what's my sleeping style I also like a firm mattress the mattress I have is called the Plank .",

I think that\u2019s just the nature of down pillows. These still don\u2019t spread entirely across the headboard but I\u2019m happy with the look. Down pillows rest in whatever squished position you want them them to and give of a subtle luxury vibe. Extra cute when I punch down the middle into a little V. These pillows have good fill and no weird smell. Also the white fabric doesn\u2019t show through my shams. Love them.",

I have found the same thing, they are not big fluffy pillows, and for me that is a great thing. I am a tummy sleeper and have had fluffy pillows for years, I have also had chronic neck pain. Since I have been using these new ones I have not once, in the last month, had a sore neck. Yes they are a flatter pillow, and that may not be what you are looking for based on your sleep position. I have found them to be extremely comfortable.",
