Their memory foam Super lightweight and fluffy. Other memory pillows that are pretty firm and not as comfortable as these. They come air sealed and rolled up really small, so I was worried about how thin they were gonna be once I open them up and let them sit out for about 15 minutes. They are super full perfect size and exceeded any expectations. If you\u2019re looking for a quality pillows that support your neck if your side sleeper this is the perfect pillow.",
