                "reviewText": "This pillow is not what I expected. For about three years I was sleeping on a M# Pill#w..... it was great, for a while.Problem was, it didn't support as well as I thought it did.After putting my back and neck out of place, sleeping on this pillow only served to worsen my back and neck pain. Ended up in chiropractic to get everything realigned.This was the point where I realized I needed a different pillow to properly support my neck.I purchased this pillow as it was the first one I came across and liked what I saw.I have to say, my neck and back pain have basically gone away. My chiropractor says after a couple more fine tuning/evaluation visits I will be down to just check ups every 6 months.All because of this pillow!The material is soft yet, firm. Adjusts to the natural contours of your neck and supports very well. Both sides rise up at different heights to allow for adjustment depending on how big or little you are and it has a removable center baffle for thse who need more support heighy.The pillow cover is zippered for easy access and helps keep the pillow together since it is actually in three separate pieces.The only issue I have is putting the pillow back into the pillow case. The memory foam wants to attach itself to the interior of the case and has kind of a velcro effect that makes it somewhat difficult to position the pillow properly within the case.Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT! Glad I purchased it and highly recommend it for those looking for a good contoured pillow.",

                "reviewText": "This is the better of the three memory foam pillows that I purchased. I purchased another pillow from a seller on Amazon that was a completely different type of pillow (even though it is also made of \u201cmemory foam\u201d, it is shredded and not a \u201ccontour\u201d pillow. I purchased a different contour pillow from Macy\u2019s and they sent me the wrong product; I had intended for this pillow (the one that I am reviewing) to be my contour pillow, and the pillow from Macy\u2019s was not supposed to be contoured, but they sent me the contour pillow anyway\u2014so now I have that contour pillow to compare this one to. That pillow is smaller, and even though it is advertised as being \u201coversized\u201d, it is too small for (it does not fill) my standard size pillowcases); thus, the pillowcase slips off. The pillow from Macy\u2019s was listed with the retail price of $139; however, the one that they sent me (that I purchased for $23, so it was supposedly a Black Friday super markdown \u201cdeal\u201d) and I found the same pillow on Amazon for $23, at $89 retail (so I am assuming that Amazon is correctly listing the suggested retail price, whereas Macy\u2019s inflated the retail price in order to give the impression that it was a \u201ccrazy good deal\u201d or that it was a \u201cbargain that could not be refused\u201d for potential buyers and window-shoppers during the Black Friday and \u201ccyber Monday\u201d season of consuming. This pillow (the one that I am reviewing) is far superior to the one that I had gotten \u201csuch an amazing deal on\u201d from the Macy\u2019s Black Friday sale. It is similar in its design, but larger and slightly firmer (it feels higher quality, like it will last longer; and it also stays just as cool as any memory foam pillow I have ever tried (including the \u201chigh end\u201d brand makes and models, even those that boast being exclusively made of Eucalyptus Lyocell, those sold by or marketed alongside the hipster-chic and \u201ceco-conscious\u201d, \u201chumanely\u201d or \u201cethically manufactured\u201d (that claim to be, and hopefully that actually are, but advertising copy can sometimes mislead\u2014even when coming from these supposedly ethical (and certainly upscale) brands. This memory foam contour pillow (the one that I am reviewing) feels as good as Eucalyptus lyocell (it is made of rayon; this pillow is\u2014viscose from bamboo, it is the same process being done to bamboo as is done to Eucalyptus to make the pulp that is viscose that makes rayon\u2014so it does feel the same; it is just that the sustainability factor is not really discussed at all by brands that do not appeal strongly to the eco-chic upscale consumer bracket. I give this pillow a five-star rating in all categories in this review, because it is better than I expected; it is what it is (what it says it ys) and it does not claim to be ethical, sustainable, or revolutionary in terms of its place on the spectrum of memory foam pillows to try. It does not make the claim that this is \u201chealthy\u201d memory foam (there really is no such thing, considering what memory foam actually is). This is a decent pillow. It \u201csleeps cool\u201d and is good for sleeping with spinal alignment issues, in my experience.",

                "reviewText": "It took me some time to get used to this pillow. I tried it with and without the insert, multiple nights. I tried it on all sides. I've had it for about 3 months and have just now figured it out. I use it without the insert and sleep on the higher side (I am on a smaller person). I really like it. My neck issues have been resolved (I was suffering daily before I got this pillow). The lack of a star is because it does retain heat from my head. There is no flipping over a pillow like this to cool off, but it's worth it to me. I sleep on my side. I have found that with the insert in, laying on the higher side, it's great for laying on your back. The relief I feel in my neck is amazing. The case is soft and seems to be very good quality. The pillow holds its shape perfectly. I'm quite happy that I didn't give up on it. I would also like to add that I use this pillow with my \"My Pillow\" on top, if I want to watch TV, laying down.",

                "reviewText": "I've had mine for almost two years now (since December 2021), and it's still going strong.A couple years ago I suddenly couldn't sleep right with my old pillow anymore and so I began to look for a new pillow. The first one I bought was some \"hotel-quality\" one that looked nice, but once I rest my head on it my head sunk right through it and I got zero neck support. I next tried a DreamyBlue pillow and at first it was great: it was giant, thick, and very fluffy. Alas, after a couple weeks I started getting neck pain from sleeping with my neck bent at a 45 degree angle each night because of how high off the bed the DreamyBlue pillow let my head rest.I next tried this UTTU Sandwich Pillow, and it was perfect right away. The neck support is great, and it's just thick and fluffy enough to support my head, as well. I sleep on it either on my side or on my back and it's very comfortable either way. Highly recommended for anyone that's developed neck pain from sleeping on traditional pillows.",
