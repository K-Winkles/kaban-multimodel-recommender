Over the years our pillow has greatly improved the sleep and bedtime routines of tens of thousands of toddlers around the world. It is time for your little one to experience the ultimate comfort that comes only from a product tailor made for them, well-researched and hand-crafted with great love. Measuring 13 inches X 18 inches the pillow may seem tiny at first. But it's just in a toddler's size, perfect to keep their little head, neck and shoulders in a correct, healthy and comfortable position while sleeping. This small size offers a much more relaxed and personalized sleeping experience compared to larger pillows. The filling amount is just as important as the pillow size. No matter if your little one is a tummy, back or side sleeper, our pillow will adjust to their individual sleeping style. The filling is soft and designed to easily compress according to use. We also use little filling. As parents we thought that a full and really fluffy pillow is best, but after a lot of tests and working closely with specialists and with the kids themselves, we found that a pillow on the flatter side is the way to go. A flatter pillow is the most comfortable for toddlers, and it also helps them sleep in a healthy posture and makes the transition to a regular pillow an easy, safe and fun experience.",

And at the same time we wanted the pillow to be safe and as organic as possible. It was not easy, but we are very proud that we managed to achieve exactly that. The pillow's cover is made 100% out of premium organic cotton. To make the cover resistant and keep any impurities out, we use a high thread-count and a special tight weave. This also makes the cover soft to the touch and eliminates the need for a pillowcase. Light and soft, the filling is a proprietary cluster fiber. The filling is not 100% organic because it is man-made, but it is unlike anything on the market. We go to great lengths to develop our poly cluster fiber 'in-house'. This means the filling is made entirely in the USA and more importantly, it gives us great control over every part of the manufacturing process. We develop our fiber very differently than the rest of the industry -both in terms of design and in terms of materials used in manufacturing it. We do not treat the fiber with anything. Our fiber is Latex free, Phthalate free, Formaldehyde free, BPA free and Lead free. And we don\u2019t use any flame retardants either. But why didn't we choose something 100% organic for the filling? Well, we did a lot of tests with various organic and non-organic filling materials. We tested kapok, wool, cotton, hemp, buckwheat, down, foam and many others. Those filling materials were not comfortable, not good for a child's healthy development (neck and spine) due to the firmness and shape or they became useless after a few uses (lost shape, became lumpy, could not be machine washed -or cleaned in any way for some of them). Our one of a kind cluster fiber filling, makes this pillow soft but long-lasting, with an average lifetime of 3 to 5 years. It will keep it's shape and it will not get lumpy, even after hundreds of wash/dry cycles! With our Little One's Pillow we managed to create a product of unmatched craftsmanship. The supportive, premium polyester fiber, is covered in the finest organic cotton around, all handcrafted together with great attention to detail. Washing Instructions: wash on cold, gentle cycle, and dry thoroughly on low.",

A pillow is a big step for any toddler and one that is too fluffy can cause all sorts of problems like neck kinks, restlessness or even unhealthy spine development. With the help of chiropractors and pediatricians we found just the right amount of filling needed for a toddler. Our pillow is on the flatter side, but it strikes a balance between flat and fluffy. Your little one will be so comfortable! Our Filling is Different Unlike most pillows, our cluster fiber filling is designed not to get lumpy. Instead of a continuous fiber filament, we use thousands of tiny fiber balls that rearrange constantly depending on the use of the pillow. This being said, because we use little filling to help toddlers sleep in a healthy posture, in some rare cases, the filling has a tendency to bunch up or shift from side to side. Usually giving the pillow a good shake or a wash will fix the problem. And if that doesn't work, we stand by our pillow even a full year after your purchase with a regular replacement or a custom fill replacement, no questions asked. The Finest Organic Cotton The pillow's shell is made 100% out of the finest organic cotton. Pure and natural, our organic cotton is completely different from regular cotton. There are over 35 harmful substances applied repeatedly to regular cotton (from the seeding stages to the final production stages). For the organic cotton, we use none of them. Not a single one. Made With Love and Care We strive to be very transparent when it comes to the manufacturing process and all the materials used in our pillows. Proudly made in USA, we support other local small businesses by sourcing our raw materials from them. We are putting an incredible amount of love, care, dedication and personalized attention to detail into each and every pillow and this is easily reflected in our product's superior comfort and in how we treat all of our customers.",

                "reviewText": "After a lot of looking around, I decided to give this toddler pillow a try and buy it, even though I had second thoughts because of the low review count. I'm so glad I did that! To say I am impressed with this pillow and company would be a huge understatement.The pillow is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it is just right for my little boy (3 and a half years old) and he takes it everywhere with him (we even had to take it grocery shopping believe it or not). We also bought a second pillow for our 15 month old daughter...it seems a little high/fluffy for her right now, but she will definitely love it in a few months.And come to think of it, before I bought this pillow we had trouble putting our son to sleep...now he actually looks forward to taking his daily naps and I notice he yawns less and has more energy, which makes me think he has sleeps better since this pillow.The price is a real bargain for what you get, very soft to the touch cotton, breathable fabric, strong stitching and no fill lumps. And made in USA! I want the very best for my kids and this is it!The customer service is OUTSTANDING! They go the extra mile every time and they made me feel like a real valued customer. I usually don't write reviews, but I took the time to write this one because it feels so refreshing to find such a fantastic product backed by stellar customer service.Oh, and a little tip for everyone, since this pillow comes without a pillowcase, you can use a standard sized pillowcase and tuck it into itself. It's what we do and works great every time!",

                "reviewText": "The fabric is pretty soft, perfect for letting your head or arms sink right in. I've come across other organic shells that have felt stiff or a little scratchy. This one is very inviting; no need for a cover if you don't want one.The pillow isn't densely packed, which is perfect for my uses, but it's super lofty and cushy. I purchased for my 2-yr old, but am now considering getting one for myself to hug when sleeping on my side. (I would hug my husband, but a pillow doesn't move or snore). My 2-yr old wasn't impressed upon introduction, but he's been sleeping without any pillow so far, and usually bunches up a small blanket underneath his chest and tummy. And then sleeps with his rear in the air. So I'm not sure yet how he'll end up using it. He did put his head on it a couple times, but then tossed it on the floor. I also asked my 5-yr old to try it. He said it was too small for him, especially since he's been using standard pillows for a couple of years (I never found a good toddler pillow for him when he was younger). I WISH that I had found this pillow back then, as I really do love this little pillow. If after a couple of months my toddler doesn't start using the pillow, he'll never see it again, because it will be mine. Ha ha ha! (...she grins with an evil laugh)Good customer service, especially in making sure that you wash properly (gentle, warm or cold, and low/med dry setting), and how to use a standard pillow case to cover it.",

I will eventually get one as my 2-year-old tends to sweat in her sleep, and I would rather not wash the entire pillow too often in order to prolong its life.The first pillow we received was a little too soft for my daughter, who was used to a standard-sized firm pillow. While she liked the fact that it was her size, it took some getting used to the smaller size and fluffiness of the pillow.The owner of the company sent personal follow-up emails, one of which was to ensure my satisfaction with their product. The owner was more than happy to send a customized pillow\u2014a firmer one\u2014for my daughter. When the second pillow arrived, the firmness was perfect, but it was a little too high. It is starting to compress a little, and my daughter IS now using the pillow every day, though she does roll off of it every single night. She does find the pillow and plop back on it, so I don\u2019t think it really bothers her. She also moves a lot in her sleep, and I noticed that she sleeps well on the pillow in any sleeping position (when she stays on)\u2014back, side, stomach. Sometimes, she\u2019ll just hug the pillow instead of lying on it.For the excellent customer care from the company, the high quality of the pillow, and the price point, I am very glad I bought this pillow out of all the organic toddler pillow options out there!",
