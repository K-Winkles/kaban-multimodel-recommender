I got her this bamboo pillow to replace it a few months ago and she loves it, it\u2019s has stayed full and firm and 100% hers and she\u2019s not willing to share and my jealousy raged ! She finally grew tired of my whining and bought me one of my own, it showed up today !This pillow is very supportive yet soft & comfortable. I\u2019m a side sleeper and my head can\u2019t be buried into a pillow, it\u2019s too claustrophobic. Laying my head on this pillow is like laying on a comfortable piece of stone. I know, sounds weird but my face is clear and my head is firmly supported. I haven\u2019t felt the need to wrap my body around this yet but if I do, it\u2019s nice to have that option.Anyway, great GREAT pillow and I\u2019m VERY pleased with the quality of materials and construction.If your in the market for a body pillow, look no further.",

I finally gave in and ordered this memory foam body pillow here on Amazon, and I absolutely love it. It's a little heavy, which I like, and it gives excellent support for my legs and arms. Very comfortable. I'm glad that I bit the bullet, and made the purchase. The cover that came with it was great, but it was light color and I didn't want it to look disgusting after a while, so I bought a dark cover for it, but it's not as comfortable as the cover that came with the pillow.",

It's too over-stuffed for me, and it feels like I'm sleeping with an obstacle. Part of what I want in a body pillow is something I can put my leg over, without having my foot sticking 12\" in the air. Regardless of what they say in their advertising...I GET HOT AND SWEATY sleeping with it. Now with that said, it's not too bad to sleep with once you get over how big it is and that getting hot will wake you up. If you sleep with a partner, better get a King-size bed to accommodate the additional body-like lump you will be sharing your bed with.As far as \"memory foam\" goes, I think it loses it's memory when shredded. It's a good way to use left over memory foam but something gets lost in the translation.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second body pillow I have owned from this manufacturer. The first one I had was great, but it was heavy. Due to medical problems I gave it to my son, and he still uses it! I discovered that the lightweight pillows do not hold their shape and go flat. After several years I decided to get the same body pillow again. I received it yesterday and I was surprised to see the directions saying you had to massage the pillow and put it in the dryer once a week for 1 month! Instead of all that nonsense I opened the pillow package about 7 hours prior to bed so it could puff up! I put a body pillow case on it and it was fantastic!!!! Something new with this pillow is that you can remove some of the shredded memory foam to make it your perfect pillow!!!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not sure what happened to this product. I have 2 of the King Size pillows from this same company, bought within the last year. I mean it\u2019s everything you could actually hope for. Floating clouds. So when I found myself single and decided I wanted something soft between my legs, I of course set my eyes on the floating cloud. I go to my old Cloud purchase, click the same company, grab the King Size\u2026 realize it\u2019s more expensive than others, but I think \u201cIt\u2019s worth it man, how often do you get to ba.. uh sleep with a floating cloud?\u201d So I bought it.When it arrived I woke up and went outside to go to work. I got it out of the box and unrolled it. It was compressed and figured it needed time to rise, we\u2019ve all been there (especially us older guys). I set it on the bed and went to work. Rough day. Tired. Wanted to shower and relax in bed. I go to the bedroom and I simply can\u2019t express how shocked I am (well not as shocked as when I found my ex but we\u2019ll say it\u2019s a close 2nd). This pillow rose like an inch (like my ex\u2019s new bf). This thing is literally flatter than my ex\u2019s backside, and has much less secondary uses.I wish I could swear in this review. There\u2019s so much rage in me. I\u2019m not sure what happened to the company. My best guess? They\u2019re also going through a rough breakup because it looks like their girl took half of the freaking stuffing when she split.It\u2019s been 6 days. I\u2019m returning this trash.*Will update with photos*",

I like to hug my pillow all night and keep my legs wrapped around as I am a side sleeper, but its rather heavy and I need to wake up in order to move it around with me. I am 5'5\" and length is perfect. I am also a large lady (200lbs). None the less the quality is excellent and the material is soft and breathable. TO THE MANUFACTURER: if you made the width a few inches thinner - around 4 inch loss in total circumference (and therefore removed some of the stuffing to make it lighter and saved yourself some cost of fabric and stuffing) it would be perfect. I will be adjusting this and sewing it on my own. Great pillow overall just the same.",
