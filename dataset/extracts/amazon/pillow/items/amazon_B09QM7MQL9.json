Squeeze the pillows2. Hit the pillows (softly on the bed)3. Massage Evenly the pillows4. Let them air out for 24hrs to inflate completely. (And they will)IT WORKS! We have had our pillows for over a month, and they're still just as comfortable, supportive & soft & fluffy like they were 24hrs after we unwrapped them.
