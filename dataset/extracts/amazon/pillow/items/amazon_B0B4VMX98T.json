After opening the box/packaging, the pillows were as flat as a pancake but once I threw them in the dryer for a short bit, they fluffed right up and felt firm. The first night I didn\u2019t remove any fill because I wanted to try them out as they were. I realized after, that I would need to remove some fill because they were much too firm for me. I removed about 1/4 of the fill and now they are perfect. So happy I ordered these pillows and would recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "(Pictures are after I removed the foam I didn\u2019t need. I put a 6oz sunscreen spray bottle in the one picture for reference of how tall the pillow is after removing ABOUT 1/4th the foam).No extra foam included, but they are overly-filled with foam so they are quite thick and firm.I got it for my 4 year old and had to remove 3 gallon-sized ziplock bags worth - probably about 1/4th of the foam to get it thinner and safer for my young child.They were fully to size within maybe a few hours. They do come with a pretty strong smell - I haven\u2019t tried the drier option yet; if they still smell strong tomorrow after 24 hours of airing out, then I\u2019ll try the dryer option.They are very soft fabrics and soft squishy foam (the more foam you leave in, the firmer it is and the more you take out, the squishier it is). It does come with two zip pillowcases. The first one contains all the purple foam and is seemingly a basic zippered pillowcase. The 2nd one is the outer white/blue zippered casing that goes over the 1st casing. The 2nd casing is the soft/cooling one you see in the pictures and description.The white side is extra soft and the blue side is noticeably cooling (still soft but more of a slick soft vs the white is more plush soft)Things I would change:- less smell (I don\u2019t mind that there is some smell initially, but it\u2019s taking longer to dissipate than preferred and it is pretty strong)- wish it came with a large sealable bag to put the extra foam in for people that don\u2019t want that thick or firm of a pillow. I used 3 gallon sized ziplock bags to remove estimated 1/4th of the foam best guess. Not absolutely necessary, but would be a nice touch.- maybe I missed the info, but I wish either the inner or the outer pillowcase was a \u2018protector\u2019 as in: waterproof, hypoallergenic, bedbug & dust mite protection. I\u2019m probably going to order a true protector, remove the 2nd outer cooling casing, put on the actual protector, and then put the cooling cover on as a 3rd casing. I feel silly maybe having so many casings but the 1st is important to contain the foam, 2nd to protect the pillow, & 3rd to have the cooling & softness features. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it is what it is I guess.",

Yet after about thirty minutes the area your head is laying on is still very firm, yet almost flat with very little lift for your head. So, while I can say the actual construction and quality of pillows is good. For me it is not what I need for a comfortable sleep. Would return if I had good transport into town to do the return. So I am still in the market for a good sleeping pillow. I guess they are adjustable by removing some of the filling, but then they would not have enough lift.",

I\u2019ve never felt the need to fluff it up through the night. I actually took a little of the filling out because I felt the pillow was just a bit too high. There was no extra filling provided.The pillows have a light scent along the lines of soap\u2026 maybe a lavender soap. It\u2019s actually not a bad scent and it didn\u2019t seem synthetic or chemical-like. The scent is fading day by day and barely noticeable how.I took the recommendation that came with the pillows and threw them in the drier after opening to fluff them up initially. It\u2019s amazing to see how full these pillows get after being so compact in the box.I can\u2019t say this is a cooling pillow. I\u2019ve briefly tried more expensive cooling pillows and they seemed to just not warm up very quickly. The blue side of this pillow feels cool on initial touch but unfortunately it didn\u2019t feel much different from my previous \u201cnormal\u201d pillow not long after. I suppose it does cool off quickly when you change positions though.",
