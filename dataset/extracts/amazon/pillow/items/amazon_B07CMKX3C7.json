                "reviewText": "This pillow is heavy - I'm in relatively good shape and each time I move this, I feel like I'm getting a workout - just dead weight. Pillows shouldn't be this heavy.It's ridiculously flat. Any weight whatsoever on it, makes it go completely flat. I mean flat like well under an INCH flat. If I were to measure it, it would most likely be 1/2\" high once (no kidding) when my head is on it.I am a stomach sleeper (worst position) and I bought this thinking I could use it lengthwise under my stomach and head - maybe providing some support... It's exactly the same as using nothing!I happened to have a back issue just days after receiving this and this forced me to have to sleep on my back and side for a few days. Again I tried, oh how I tried! I literally folded the pillow in half, trying to \"stuff\" it under my neck\" for support and still it was SO flat and so heavy that I couldn't stand it. I placed it under my spine and it was the same as having NOTHING there at all.My breaking point - the HEAT. Incredible heat is generated from this pillow and this is when I found myself throwing it off the bed in the middle of the night - and that was memorable since it feels like flinging a bowling ball! Also, I'm in MN, and the house temp is about 65 degrees at night!! I have NEVER had \"heat\" issues.After spending $45 on it, I'm not ready to chuck it but, seriously, this is the worse pillow I have ever owned, and I have had a LOT of pillows, typically high end pillows. I love the feel of the memory foam (when you press your hand into it) BUT, the con's outweigh the pros - by a longshot!Do yourself a favor a get a SOFT MyPillow. Forget politics, his pillows are fantastic. The first one I ever bought is nearly 20 years old and still looks and feels brand new after countless washings. Before buying this pillow, I would re-buy pillows on a regular basis - about every 6 months. When I came on here searching for pillows, I was looking to find something specific to stomach sleeping.If you like flat, heavy and hot pillows - you're gonna love this baby. If not, you may want to reconsider, especially at $45.00.Update 05/22/2022: Okay, I have no idea what happened. The pillow remains flat, heavy and does need to be flipped several times a night BUT, for some crazy reason, it has become my FAVORITE pillow - and I have many! Maybe it's the ugly dog factor... you spend so much time dwelling on it that you bond with it on a subconscious level, who knows!Regardless, I came in here tonight to possibly buy a second one. Price has gone up - a lot! I love it for support, under my neck and recently under my hips (I have a back ache) but most of all, it's a dream for stomach sleepers - although I really want to break this habit. I still have my \"My pillow\" next to me as well along with two travel sized pillows - it's complicated!I don't have any answers but, for me - this flat-ish, overweight lug really works!",

There are 2 thing# about this pillow that I don't like but it's only due to preference It is a little bit thin I wish it was thicker and also I wish it was more firm like the first Tempur-Pedic pillow that I bought but other than that it works great and I fall asleep and it's super comfortable",

The Amazon price is amazing, but the pillow did not feel the same. It is too firm, and did not supply comfortable support. From what I have read and been told, this is not an Amazon issue. It is a Tempur-Pedic material problem. Most Tempur-Pedic pillows are wonderful, but some are flawed. I evidently received a flawed product.",
