                "reviewText": "I bought these to match the fitted sheets - one I\u2019ve had in rotation for 4 years that I\u2019ve been really pleased with, one extra I\u2019ve just bought - but it\u2019s a bit of a mixed review for the pillowcases.Looking at some of the other reviews talking about the fabric being scratchy and hard makes me think I\u2019ve received a totally different product! But just like the fitted sheets, the pillowcases are smooth due to the 400 thread count, with a slight sheen due to the sateen weave, and are exactly what I expected and hoped for in that area. The dark grey colour is versatile and also very pleasant to my eye, and I appreciated the sewn border detail along one side, which is an unexpected feature in a good value \u201cbasics\u201d range.BUT - and it\u2019s the factor that means I\u2019m returning these instead of using them happily for years like the sheets - they don\u2019t have an envelope! I think without exception until now, every pillowcase I\u2019ve used in my 40 years has included an envelope flap to cover the end of the pillow, and I hadn\u2019t realised this was a feature I needed to specifically look for! As I was testing the size on my current pillows (fine, incidentally, for standard sized pillows), I actually had to turn the case inside out because I couldn\u2019t work out where the envelope flap was, and was confused about it just not existing!The product description doesn\u2019t mention the envelope flap at all, and there aren\u2019t any photos that shows the side view with the pillow inner exposed - just some careful shots chosen that make it look like any normal (enclosed) pillow, which I believe is misleading.Obviously there are bigger problems in the world than pillowcases without envelope flaps, but to me it seems like a very strange choice to sell open-ended ones, but then go to the trouble of adding a sewn border detail to that open end! If I were to keep these, I would have to position them so the open end was facing away from the door to the room (it would look scruffy and untidy to have a gaping open end on display, with a contrasting colour pillow inside), so that extra detail would also be less visible. More than just for aesthetics, I want an envelope flap for my pillowcases to protect the pillow itself from dust/fluff from my cats/etc, so I guess it\u2019s back to the drawing board to find a good quality cotton pillowcase to match my sheets.",
