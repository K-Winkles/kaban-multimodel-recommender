The pillows are pretty big for a queen, but they fit in my queen pillow cases just fine. I was truly surprised on the support for my neck that I get from this pillow. I would say they are medium- soft, no issues with them going flat. I can honestly say that for the last two weeks so far I am not waking up in the middle of the night to flip my pillow and my neck is doing pretty good with the pillow. I highly recommend this pillow.",
