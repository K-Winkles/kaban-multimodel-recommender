                "reviewText": "I really like this pillow. I am a side and back sleeper, so I like that the cover has a sort of gusset on each side and not in the middle. Gives more support when I am on my side, and doesn't hurt my neck when I am on my back. The filling is good quality, and clean (if you know what I mean). No weird colors or bits of anything in the filling, just soft and gives a consistent supportive cushy feeling. I have tried other shredded foam pillows that had poor quality filling ...seemed to be just regular foam with harder pieces mixed in etc. Just didn't feel great, or look like quality filling. I haven't used this long, but so far it has helped the neck pain that the last pillow seemed to cause. I have tried so many pillows and this one is a stand out. I would recommend this. Good quality at a great price. \ud83d\ude42p.s. There is a slight smell when you take this pillow out of the package. After washing the cover and throwing the pillow in the dryer, with a dryer sheet, for a few mins it was no longer noticeable. I'm sure just letting the pillow air out for a day or two would accomplish the same.",

Packaging nice and compressed, pillows in vacuum bags which means they did to get stored in warehouses nor transport trucks exposed to particulates (dust, mold spores, etc) rather air tight. Came with box protection so you did not accidentally slice open pillow. Came with a nice thank you/instructions hand out about opening and letting them form. The extra stuffing is a bonus. Initial reason for purchase: I had memory foam bed pillows and needed to replace the sofa back cushions and these kings were sized perfectly. BUT I will be ordering queen for my bed after I examined in the insides! On this initial order I used one of the four pillows to over stuff the other three to the right size for my sofa back cushions. I was very impressed with the inner lawyer cover and quality of foam. There were no plastics in it! It was fluffy, clean all foam. When I saw that I took apart one of my expensive cooling gel bed pillows and found plastic chunks mixed in. I couldn\u2019t believe it - those premium pillows were filled with literal garbage. So I will be ordering 2 of these in queen for my bed. HIGHLY recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My husband is very hard to please when it comes to pillows. He has major neck issues and the wrong pillow can be debilitating. I can honestly say he has used this pillow more over the last two weeks than any other pillow. He truly enjoys it and says it the best we\u2019ve found yet. I personally believe it is a very comfortable pillow but I have yet to find the right balance with the stuffing. This pillow is extremely fluffy but it does support your head and neck. Just sometimes a little too much. But it is adjustable, so to speak. You can add or remove stuffing. When these pillows arrive they smell very bad. But if you follow the directions in the packaging and put them in the dryer with a dryer sheet to fluff them, the smell goes away pretty quick. I will be keeping this link and buying these pillows again and again.",

                "reviewText": "The red spot is not a stain, it\u2019s the reflection from a red light bulb.I ordered 4 of the king sized pillows and 2 of the body sized pillows. These pillows are everything I was looking for with the best price. The fabric is very well made. The filling is so soft and plushy. They do have a bit of smell but it\u2019s not terrible and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll resolve itself within a few days. It\u2019s not very noticeable. I almost didn\u2019t purchase these because there\u2019s not many reviews, doesn\u2019t seem like a popular brand but I\u2019m so glad that I did! Highly recommend!",

I had my other memory foam flat pillow for side sleepers for about 3 years, but my 2 year old stole it so I found these homelab ones and I am IMPRESSED! THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE!!Now, the reason for only 4 stars. The smell of them is horrible. It's been 3 nights and I can still smell this weird odor. Not sure if anything can be done about it. I'm praying with a few more nights it will go away.",

I use it as is for side sleeping but it comes with extra filling to make it firmer if you need to. It does have a slight odor that dissipates within a day or so. I would definitely purchase again!",
