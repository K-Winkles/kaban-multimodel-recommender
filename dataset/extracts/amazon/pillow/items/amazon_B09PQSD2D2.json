My only (slight) complaint is that it is pretty heavy. If you roll around with your pillow it can be a little difficult (I am a small person), but overall I really like it.",

                "reviewText": "This pillow is pretty good. It was a bit thicker than it looked, so it did take some time to get used to it. The overall pillow quality, both the fabric and the filling, seems pretty good. It is soft but not too soft. The fabric is not as breathable as I wish though, so the pillow can get quite hot. I'm not sure why they added the blue name tag at one of the corners of the pillow though, it is very uncomfortable to deal with. Overall though, I'd say I'm pretty satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Siluvia Body Pillow for Adults and it's been a complete game-changer for my sleep routine! The adjustable loft feature allows me to customize the firmness to my liking, ensuring I get the perfect support every night. The quilted design not only adds a touch of luxury but also enhances the overall comfort. I was particularly impressed with the hypoallergenic and fluffy aspects of the pillow, making it a great choice for anyone with allergies or sensitive skin. The plush quality feels premium, much like a down alternative, and the dual-tone White-LightGray color is elegantly versatile. Measuring 21\u201dx54\u201d, it's the perfect size for full-body support. Highly recommend!",
