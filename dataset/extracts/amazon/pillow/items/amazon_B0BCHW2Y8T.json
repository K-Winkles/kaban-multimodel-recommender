            "\u3010MEDIUM FIRM SUPPORT\u3011- Filled with 60% feathers and 40% polyester, these feather pillow inserts have soft feeling and provide medium firm support for head and neck. Feathers ensure the pillow's softness and polyester provides support, which can avoid the shortcomings of feather pillow's too soft and down alternative pillow's too hard.",
            "\u3010ITEM SIZE & DESIGN\u3011- Feather pillow measures 20x28 inches. Our feather down pillow is finished with decorative silver piped edges that gives the pillow a beautiful looking and prevent feather and down from shedding.",
            "\u3010SOFT COVER\u3011- Our pillow down is encased in a high-density down-proof polyester cover which is breathable and skin-friendly. Unique fabric avoids feathers poking your face and fine needle stitching ensures durability, which can offer you a comfortable sleeping experience.",
            "\u3010HOW TO USE\u3011- Upon receipt, please push the down feather pillow insert in and out on all four sides and put them in a ventilated place for 1-2 days to make pillow feather return to the original shape. Bathing it in the sun for several hours is recommended for a healthier use.",
            "\u3010CARE INSTRUCTION\u3011- Machine washable in cold water with gentle cycle, tumble dry low when needed. We recommend that you use a pillowcase when using down and feather pillow. Pat the pillow every day after getting up and ventilate the pillow every 3-4 weeks to keep the pillow fluffy."

                "reviewText": "It is worth the money not to have to sleep on a combination of plastic and toxic chemicals.I wondered why for a long time I was waking up with headaches, a red face and burning eyes.Just look at the list of potentially-toxic chemicals that make up \"memory foam.\"Potentially Toxic Materials Used in Memory FoamCommon harmful chemicals that were historically found in memory foam mattresses include:Methylbenzene: Methylbenzene, more commonly known as toluene, is a clear liquid that occurs naturally in crude oil. Toluene is toxic when inhaled in large quantities.Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde sometimes results as a by-product of the foam manufacturing process, though this is much less common nowadays. Formaldehyde fumes can irritate the eyes, nose and mouth, and it is known to be a human carcinogen.Methylene Dianiline: Used as a reactant in the foam manufacturing process, methylene dianiline causes irritation when coming into contact with skin, and may be carcinogenic.Methylene Chloride: Formerly used as a blowing agent, this substance is a suspected carcinogen and can pose serious health risks if it comes into contact to the skin or mucous membranes.Chlorofluorocarbons: Chlorofluorocarbons were formerly used as a blowing agent, but use of these substances is now limited because of their ozone-depleting effects.Toluene is what they used to put in wite-out and it's totally toxic. Who thinks it's a good idea to sleep on something that gives off formaldehyde fumes?These pillows are not full of chemicals, they're natural, squishy and wonderful and WHAT A RELIEF. Very highly recommended.",
