It's been a dream, no pun intended :)The first thing that struck me was the quality. The memory foam is of top-notch, providing the perfect balance between support and softness.One of the great features of this pillow is its shape and design.The gentle slope and contouring not only support the natural curve of my neck but also aligns my spine, giving me healthy sleep posture.I've noticed a significant reduction in neck pain and stiffness since I started using this pillow.It's very versatile, whether I sleep on my back or my side, the pillow provides consistent support. The height is just right \u2013 not too high to strain my neck or too low to compromise support.The cooling memory foam is awesome, giving me a great comfortable sleeping experience throughout the night.if you're looking for a pillow that combines support, comfort, and durability, this is your guy!",

I was told to buy a neck pillow and decided to give this one a shot because of the reviews and price. The first night I used this was the first night I actually slept through the night. It really forms around your neck and head and is super supportive without being too hard. The case is silky so it doesn't wreck your hair. There was no smell in my pillow. It came in a super tight roll and needed a few hours to fluff up. It even came two days earlier than it was supposed to. If you are on the fence, just buy it!",

The texture and softness is wonderful. Just the first night and what comfort it provided. I was very pleased and still am. I have had a cervical pillow for the past two years but it hasn't seemed as comfortable as it first was, so I thought it was time for a new one. The price and reviews were great so I decided to give it a try. Wow..., I am not disappointed. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommended it for anyone who cannot position their neck comfortably for sleep. Very nice.",

I also use it on my couch behind my head while watching Tv.It has just the right slope for me and I like the way it cradles my head. I also love the cool feel of it, my head doesn\u2019t get warm. I just started using it with a mulberry silk pillowcase (also from Amazon) and the combo is so extra comfy.",
