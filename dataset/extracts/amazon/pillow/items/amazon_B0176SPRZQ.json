The quality of sleep is much better than any other pillow I have ever used prior! I have been trying to train my body to sleep on my back and these pillows have allowed me to do just that with support and comfort at the same time. When I use these pillows for sleep I never wake up with neck or upper back pain anymore. I always had back and neck problems growing up because of how I sleep but this product is definitely worth every penny! The pillows themselves take a while to inflate once you remove them from their packaging but I promise they are worth it! You will sleep so much better! I also bought the bed length size cool bamboo pillow as well!",

                "reviewText": "I really like firm pillows so I decided to purchase these because they are advertised as firm and made from bamboo. They came in a reasonable time and you have to pull them out of a tightly packaged zip bag so they are flat as a pancake at first. After you massage them over and over for several minutes, the instructions say to leave them for at least 24 hours so gain shape. I did all of this and then tried to lie down on them. These are definitely extra super firm to the point that they weren\u2019t even malleable and my head wouldn\u2019t pay flat. If you are a side sleeper, these will work great right out the gate for you. I happen to be a back sleeper so my circulation kept getting cut off all night because my chin ended up in my chest and I couldn\u2019t breathe for the first few nights. I am going to keep using them and see how they do after a month or so because I watched a few YouTube videos that say these bamboo pillows will eventually soften a little to the point where they stay firm but won\u2019t choke us back sleepers. I will update my review if things change.",

                "reviewText": "I have been searching for awhile for a pillow with the right amount of height and support. I had purchased these in the past in stores and remembered being happy with them so I purchased them again and what I received was a VERY different product. They come vacuum sealed and rolled up into cylinders (and you literally have to cut them out of the packaging so I'm not sure how they accept returns...we'll find out). It took a couple of days for them to rebound enough to even distribute the material within the case and I had hope that the material would continue to relax as they were used but that hasn't happened at all after a month of use. They continue to be as hard as they were when they were received and have absolutely no give at all. You seriously may as well be trying to sleep on a cinder block. They're so hard you can't even try to manually reshape them. I'm not sure if the material simply can't withstand the vacuum sealing process or if this is a completely different product that I had previously purchased. Woke up this morning with an extremely stiff and painful neck and decided it was time to give up on them. Will be trying to return but not sure how that's going to go because again you're not able to get them back into their package after you cut them out of it (I didn't keep it anyway because of that and my confidence that I would like this product because I had used it before).",
