What I like about this one is that it is the functional half of the large Core pillow. I could pack it back and forth if I needed to. It does take some getting used to if you've never used such a thing before, so expect to use it for just a couple hours a night for several days, going back to whatever pillow you are used to until you can go the whole night on it. I like that my head can fall back while the pillow is supportive enough to hold my neck. The irregular shape allows you to choose more or less height for your neck. I find I can even sleep on the end of it when I turn to my side.If I get tired of my Core pillow, I may buy one for home use as well. It is also a great price!",

It shows an 8 minute cervical stretch with the low sides at your shoulders and 8 hour sleep position flipped with the high side at your shoulders.I don\u2019t have spinal issues but was looking for a pillow to slightly tilt my chin up to prevent further neck wrinkles an anatomically your airway is more open this way (similar to when you tilt the chin to give rescue breaths for CPR)I like the size and know if I want to take this traveling I can since hotel pillows are usually all fluff and no support.The firmness so far doesn\u2019t feel too soft or firm but I\u2019ll have to give it a few nights of sleep testing to see. So far initial impression is good!",

                "reviewText": "Wow, this is the hardest memory foam I\u2019ve ever felt. It feels like a hard surface with no give unless you try really hard to press into it. It\u2019s the weirdest, hardest memory foam product I\u2019ve ever felt. I don\u2019t believe I can return it now that I\u2019ve opened it - this one will sadly go in the dump. If you are looking for memory foam with zero give and feels like a rock, then this is for you. If you are looking for and expecting the usual give of standard memory foam, keep looking. I do not recommend this and was very surprised by it.UPDATE: Although I won't change the star rating for the product itself, I will say that the customer service from the seller was TOP NOTCH, their customer service deserves 5 stars. They saw my review and offered a refund. It's rare to see such great customer service. Because of the service they offered, I will absolutely consider buying from this seller again. Thank you seller.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This makes my neck feel great. I have a disc protrusion around C5, and this pillow functions great to relieve pain while sleeping. But, two things:One, it's now 5 months after buying it. I've washed the cover twice, and had other covers OVER it to protect it, and it has a hole in it after only 5 months and minimal washing. The fabric is stretchy and moves around a lot. Good for reinserting the memory foam, but there's a lot of creep from where it belongs. Also, I baby my things, but this still didn't last long.Two, it is really hard to keep clean. The memory foam makes me sweat, which contributes to the smell. I tried carpet powder, baking soda, mild detergent. Keep in mind, I can't use it for a few days while cleaning.So...feels great on my messed up neck. Cover hasn't lasted long. Could be hot because memory foam. Could have trouble with smell because memory foam.",
