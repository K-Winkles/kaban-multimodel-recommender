After opening them, they fluffed up and were ready to use quickly. I am a side/stomach sleeper so use them in front of and behind me. They were nice and firm and they kept their shape when I layed on them (not going flat like many other pillows can do). I sleep hot and usually have to turn my pillow over multiple times during the night but I only flipped this one once. I also didn\u2019t have to adjust it under my head like I have to do with other pillows; it was comfortable as soon as I put my head on it. I don\u2019t usually write reviews but I had to write this one because I am so impressed by these pillows.",
