                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been on the search for the perfect pillow to replace the elusive & famous Coconut Bliss pillow sold by mattress firm many years ago. ( I know they sell one now but read it\u2019s nowhere near the original). It\u2019s THE perfect pillow for side sleepers and 6-8 years in, it\u2019s still in great shape & continues to be my nightly go-to. I have the perfect pillow so why am I searching for a new one? The answer is purely out of fear of something happening to it. (and a little curiosity of current options)I\u2019m so picky when it comes to bedding (pillows, sheets, blankets, mattress protectors, pads) I don\u2019t want to find myself in a mad rush looking for an alternative.Suffice to say, bedding is VERY important to me. I\u2019ve put in more hours than I\u2019m willing to admit finding the perfect sleep space.I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d, mainly side sleeper, who runs very hot. I appreciate good quality, good build, and transparency. (many times you do not know what a product is made of until you get it in your hands and read the little tag that everyone is so scared to rip off :)Although Amazon\u2019s return policy best in its class, one is still required to repackage, & drive to a UPS or equivalent, and wait in lines. If Amazon could find a way to do all those steps for me, I\u2019d never shop anywhere else. (I\u2019m only half joking)What I like abt this pillow is the amt of customizations available. And those customizations are out of the box, as I understand it, if you reach out to them they will send more of whatever inserts you need to make the perfect pillow, which is commendable and differentiates them from many other competitors.I think this is the future of pillow manufacturing and they are a step ahead of the rest for this feature alone.Every body is different. Height, weight, neck to shoulder measurements, all play a factor. Sleep positions vary, body temps run vastly different, and mattress types matter when you\u2019re looking for a pillow. There can never be a one size fits all pillow.This LUXOME LAYR pillow comes about as close as you can to a one-size-fits-all pillow without paying the exorbitant prices for the \u201cNoble Pillow\u201d which START at $350.If my budget allowed for it, I\u2019d have kept this pillow. I still may buy it in the future because even though it wasn\u2019t my \u201cperfect\u201d pillow, all of the inserts they offer could be used in other pillows to make yourself the perfect pillow.Each piece is high-quality. It has a cooling cover, a memory foam insert, A soft insert with a down alternative filling, a gel infused shredded memory foam insert, and two different inserts made of gel infused memory foam. You can tell they did not take any shortcuts & they take their pillows seriously. You can customize it to the firmness and height you need.And what I like the best is that they proudly show that dreaded little paper label on their Amazon listing. Of all the pillows I\u2019ve looked at I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a single other one do this. Talk about transparency! When I saw that, I knew this was going to be an incredible pillow.It\u2019s also packaged very nicely and would make a wonderful gift.So while I didn\u2019t end up keeping this pillow I still think about it and I am almost positive that I\u2019m going to buy it in the future. All of those pillow inserts it came with could help bring life back to other pillows you have.One thing I\u2019m not thrilled about is that it\u2019s $40 more expensive than it was at the time of purchase but that could have been because of Black Friday sales. It\u2019s every bit worth the money.Job well done LUXOME!",

He\u2019s a stomach sleeper, I\u2019m a side sleeper and there was a lot to take in as far as the different \u201cbest\u201d pillows topping the various lists out there based on your sleep preferences. I really couldn\u2019t nail the firmness/softness/loft questions without ordering the pillows because of course, I couldn\u2019t feel them or try them. So I ordered several of the top pillows from those lists- Coop, Tempurpedic Cloud, Purple, Saybrook, etc\u2026 And then I also ordered these, which I actually didn\u2019t see on any of the lists, and I ALMOST didn\u2019t order them because of that. But I figured if I was going to be a lunatic and order this many pillows, wth, let\u2019s just see what it\u2019s about. They looked really nice and while having a smaller number of reviews, the reviews were mostly positive so I went for it. Well let\u2019s just say I could have saved myself a whole lot of hassle with returns if I had just tried these first. They are AMAZING and the design is so smart. You get the best of all of the pillows I mentioned wrapped up in 1 single pillow. They are fully adjustable in every way. You receive an amazingly soft exterior pillow cover that is also a cooling material and then every kind of insert you could ever need. You actually receive 4 inserts, because you receive 2 gel memory foam inserts in 2 different thicknesses that can be combined into 1 cover if you want to - so you have a lot of flexibility on how firm you want the pillow. And then you receive 2 more inserts - 1 is the \u201csoft\u201d insert of thinner down alternative and the other is the \u201cmedium\u201d insert of a gel/down alternative combo with medium thickness. So you have all of these thicknesses to play with to achieve the loft/height you need and also everything you need to achieve the perfect softness or firmness based on which inserts you choose AND what order you stack them in. PLUS, each insert unzips so you can take out any filling if you need to. It\u2019s a brilliant design. My husband and I who sleep nothing alike could both find perfection in this pillow, but something I hadn\u2019t even considered was how easy it was for each of us to perfect the layering, by simply flipping the pillow over and trying out a slightly firmer side or softer side and comparing without having to have all of these different pillows to try. Like I said, I really could have saved myself some trouble. So if you are on a pillow quest I would HIGHLY suggest starting with these pillows and if for some unknown reason you can\u2019t find happiness in these pillows, then go on and try the others. The only thing I think these pillows lack is natural down, so if thats your preference then I could see where this pillow could fall short, but otherwise it\u2019s a no brainer. All of the pillows I ordered had nice things about them, and I personally could have also been happy with the Saybrook as a side sleeper (I actually kept it for a guest room) but NONE of the pillows had it all going on like this one did. And you very well may end up with extra inserts that you can use to enhance other pillows for other members of your household or guests.",

                "reviewText": "I have broad shoulders and mostly sleep on my side but also have the unfortunate privilige of turning on my back at some point in the night. To find a comfortable pillow that can accommodate both sleep positions has been nearly impossible. You need more height for side sleeping and less height for back sleeping or your neck/back will be a mess either way. This pillow is the closest I've come to something great but it's still pricey for layers of memory foam which is not a new concept but this pillow stays lofty unlike my favorite pillow feel of microfiber filled which flatted and lump up after some months of use.Time will tell how this pillow performs over a longer duration of usage and if it holds up but for now it's off to a very good start.",
