Prep Your Pillow: 1.Remove your pillow from the packaging, open the vacuum sealed bag and wait for it to take shape. The pillow may look small and compact at first. 2.After removing the pillow from the packaging, remember to pat and squeeze the pillow. 3. Allow the pillow to air out for 24 hours. Then put it into your dryer on low for 5-10 minutes. This will get your shredded memory foam pillow to its best shape and normal fluffy. How to Care for Your QUTOOL Pillow: 1.Remove the outer cover and machine wash or hand wash it, hang it dry. Do not bleach. 2. You may want to put your pillow in the dryer every 3-4weeks for 5-10 minutes, This will help the pillow retain its desired shape and texture. 3.The shredded memory foam can't be washed. Do not machine wash the pillow directly. Please only wash the pillowcase. 4. Place the filling inside in a ventilated place for drying.",

                "reviewText": "When I got them my granddaughter was here. She thought it was funny the way it expanded after I opened the plastic on the first one.I slept on it that first night, absolutely great. So comfortable,. I love squishy pillows, especially when they still stay a decent size. These stay a decent size even while being squished.My other half opened the second one. After it expanded some he felt it and was surprised how cool/cold it was to the touch. After sleeping on it he was impressed.I usually get chilly right before I'm about to doze off. So I'll cover up as I get warm I fall asleep. Which kinda sucks because then I get hot in my sleep. This help fairly well to help keep me cool. At least for a while longer then normal. Plus can flip it if I start to get hot and wake up. Since other side will be cool at that point.Tried using like memory foam, bamboo, ect. Lots of those are comfortable, but they eventually heat up to my body temp, then get even hotter as it reflects the body heat back and forth between my neck/head and the pillow. I overheat fairly easily. To others I always feel cool or cold to the touch, since I have a fairly low natural body temperature. So as I warm up to what most people would find around normal, it feels like I'm in a sauna, with a blanket over me. I wake up crabby, mean, have trouble even trying to think, or get moving.So far each night I've used this pillow, I've woke up comfortable at least. It's a bit cooler then it was earlier in the summer this year. But it's still close to same temps in my house most of the year. Especially in my bedroom, which somehow always winds up being the warmest room in the house,except maybe the bathroom, no matter what time of year.So it's been helpful. Also I love the covering it comes with. It almost seems a shame to cover it with a pillowcase. The thicker feel of the material makes it seem like it will last a long time. Very well made feel to it.So perfectly sort and squishy yet kinda firm as well. I love it so does my other half. So glad it comes in two packs, since he used to absolutely hate squishy pillows. If this had been a single pretty sure he'd be constantly steeling it from me.",

This pillow is amazing! very soft but not software. It loses its height on your neck. Also not too firm where it crushes your eardrum is perfect for me. I recommend it to anyone who has the following underlined conditions. (Really like that it stays cool on your skin.)",

                "reviewText": "Ordered two king sized Qutool pillows. They arrived tightly wrapped. There was an odor - not overwhelming - but present. Over the next 24 hours the pillows inflated and the smell mostly dissipated. Instructions are included for washing the cover and ways to make the pillow fuller. The pillow felt full but soft, meaning I could press down and it would pop back up. It was easy to identify the cool side by touch and it actually stays cool all night.After sleeping on it for 2 weeks my neck hurt. I'm a side sleeper. I discovered that in the beginning of the night my spine, neck and head would be in alignment. By the morning my head would have sank into the pillow and my neck would be in a bent position. Contacted the company through Amazon Message Center and they sent more filling. This process took about 2 weeks - from initial contact and several email exchanges to actually receiving the extra stuffing. I put an entire package in my pillow. It is now heavier but firmer and sleeps better. It has just enough 'give' to allow my head to be snuggled without it dividing in half during the night.I watched all the videos and read all the reviews, Too much filling for one person may not be enough for another. I also get the impression that not all pillows are stuffed equally. My two kings pillows definitely didn't have the same amount of stuffing - or - the stuffing did not expand in the same way. Pillows and Mattress reviews are subjective to body type, sleep position and preference. I would have given this pillow 5 stars but I feel I got a little push back from the seller when I requested additional filling. I sent the request and instead of confirming my order number and address I received instructions on \"How to Fluff the Pillow\". Which prompted additional emails, explanations and conversations over a couple of days. The instructions in the box said if you need more Just Ask.Overall the Qutool is a good pillow, With the different options: Take some out or put some in. Make it warm or turn to the cool side. You can make it almost perfect!",

I have been using this pillow for a few days and it had been wonderful! I left the loft as it was shipped and find it is perfect for me. I love that I can still move the stuffing around so I can bunch it a bit as needed and that the memory foam pieces cradle my head in any position! Both sides of the pillow are cool and comfortable, too. I have been telling everyone I talk to about this amazing pillow and am going to buy one for my hubby and kids, too!",

                "reviewText": "Current pillows before this one: To try to get comfortable I have been sleeping with a down pillow under my head and down/feather pillows under each arm and whatever I happen to have in the bed for under my knees or between my knees depending on my position.Sleep position: I start the night on my back and then switch to a side/stomach position for the rest of the night - and switching from one side to the other.Reason for switching: Even laying on my back with all those pillows my arms would fall asleep with my old pillow.If I was laying on my side, my shoulders would get very sore. On my stomach, I was struggling to get comforable too. The loft has been gone from my old down pillows for awhile and it was time to try something new.Experience with this pillow:Cover: Wow the material is COLD. So I wouldn't call it a \"cooling\" pillow, the material itself is cold, almost like an ice pack. When it's extra cold in the room, I have to flip it over to the bamboo side so I\"m not too cold. But for when I want coolnees, there's always part of the pillow that is cool for me to move my face/head onto.Loft/Filling: The first night I tried it as is. I do sleep in ALL positions: back, side and stomach so I didn't expect one pillow to do it all. For the first night it was great for both laying on my back and on my side. But it was too high to comfortably lay on my stomach. Night two and beyond I removed 2 large ziplock bags of foam and it was then perfect in ALL positions.Smell: No I didn't detect an odour or any off gasing and l I'm very sensitive to this smell in general.Out of the bag: I put it straight into the dryer along with 3 softballs that I wrapped inside of mitts/hats and each one inside of a ziplock bag. I put it on low heat for 10 minutes and the pillow were fully expanded and ready to use.Overall impression: I LOVE this pillow more than I could have imagined. It gives me enough loft and support that when I lay on my side, I do not squish/hurt my shoulder at all. On my back I sink in like a down pillow and it's really soft and comfortable. It is the tiniest bit too high on my stomach but if I put my head nearer to the end of the pillow, there's less foam there and it works out.Would I buy it again? 10/10 yes! My son already bought one after I reluctantly let him try mine one night. He loves it too. He has been complaining about not having enough support in his pillows. I will buy another one and take out more of the foam so I have one that's perfect for laying on my back and side (the one I have now) and one that is perfect for when I sleep on my stomach instead of one that's almost perfect.I'm SUPER picky when it comes to pillows and I don't expect one pillow to work for all positions. However if you don't sleep on your back, side AND stomach like I do, I'm confident you can find the right amount of foam to remove/keep to have it work for you too. I've also recommened this pillow to two friends with neck problems.I'll also add that I have not had any issues with my arms/hands/fingers falling asleep when using this pillow in any position. I'm happy with the price too (I paid $42 CAD and I had a $3 off coupon) as I was considering pillow that appear to be very similar but they were over $100 more.",
