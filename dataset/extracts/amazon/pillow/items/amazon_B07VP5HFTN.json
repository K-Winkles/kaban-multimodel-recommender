                "reviewText": "Back and neck pain isn't anything new for me, I've experienced it for years and it has been getting worse. I bought the most expensive Sealys memory foam pillow for $200 and figured that had to help right? The quality was amazing but the height is 6.5 inches high so the placement of my neck from the bed while sleeping on my back gave me incredible neck pain that I had to go to the ER for. Once I figured out my mistake it brought me here.On the first night I was still in bad pain in my neck and overall my entire back from the last year of using that pillow, but laying down it immediately felt incredible. It was almost like a release of tension in my back and neck due to the height but the memory foam comfort is amazing. You might think thin would be a really slim piece of foam but it is very quality that doesn't run hot, as I'm someone who sweats a lot. After a week of use my back felt incredible, I have lower back pain daily for over 10 years and haven't felt it since. It might seem like it's hyperbole but after I did some research and asking doctors you would be surprised how much a bad mattress and/or pillow can mess up your alignment and back.The pillow case I absolutely love because it's bamboo and very light, it says it wicks moisture(different than waterproof for the heavy sweaters), but most importantly it's soft and comfortable. The issue I think I'll have right away is I didn't notice that they sell extra pillow cases, and one isn't going to be enough for me, or anyone who sweats. The pillowcase starts to lightly stain up if you have anything in your hair like grease or sweat, and it seems you have to wash it a lot sooner than usual. And since you have to air dry this and not rush the drying process I definitely need a second.All in all, I had another slim pillow in my cart that was cheaper, but decided my body was too important to go the cheap route. I'm glad I spent the money on this. I can't speak for everyone but if you're suffering from any sort of consistent back pain and you've been using a pillow either too tall or with no structure I would highly recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "I am a creature of habit, and when I really love something, it\u2019s hard for me to part with it even if it\u2019s in tatters\u2026 Welcome to my pillow nightmares! I\u2019ve known for a while that my pillow needed to be replaced as it\u2019s been horribly pilling, the fabric is almost worn down and washing it for the zillionth time was going to be its last straw, but, oh, how perfect it felt! It really dawned on me that a replacement was a must when we spent a few days at our friend\u2019s home and they had an assortment of pillows in their guesthouse to choose from - I THOUGHT I loved the Purple Pillow the best, so I ordered four of those for our home while we were there, but alas, those threw my spine all out of whack\u2026 I pawned them all off to my husband and son to use, and it luckily turns out that they actually work for them - I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I\u2019m much smaller than they are, so the Purple was too high for me even at its lowest height and since I\u2019m also a side sleeper, my head was raised too high - it was hard to fall asleep and when I awoke, my neck and back hurt. Anyway, I tried a few other highly regarded brands, and NOTHING fit the bill. See, my pillow is so flat and precisely molded to how I sleep, that I was convinced that nothing out of the package was going to mimic what took years and many washes to recreate\u2026 Then I saw an ad on Instagram for flat pillows, which I had no idea existed. I have that one on order, but in the meantime, I thought I\u2019d jump on Amazon to see what their selection of flat pillows was like so I can get one earlier, maybe even love it, but at least be able to compare (we have an obscene collection of pillows at this point, so why not add more?!) it to the one that is on order. Long story longer, I purchased this pillow and another one off of Amazon called, EliteRest, and that one feels like a little thicker and harder version of my Lululemon yoga mat, so that\u2019s a big nope, so I tried this Blissbury last night\u2026 I have to admit I had little hope in it when I first unfurled it from its bag as one of the sides was crushed, kinda like my heart at that point, but I worked it out with my hands and let it lay on a flat surface for 24 hours - I did, however, listen to advice in these reviews to NOT fluff it in the dryer like they suggest, which I\u2019m SO glad I did! Come bedtime, I had it all ready to go, but my old pillow was on standby, as it\u2019s been with every pillow trial, but this time, I did not grab it to switch it out overnight (if I feel an ounce of pain, I stop using pillows right away now, instead of torturing myself to \u201ctry to get used to it\u201d for a few nights.) Anyway, I\u2019m actually okay with the Blissbury because it\u2019s the perfect height (dare I say better than my old one?!) and just soft enough, but better yet, it does conform a bit to your head and arm (if like me, you slide your arm underneath your pillow to cradle your head) which I did not think was a possibility until many, many uses and washes. It is heavier than my old pillow, but that\u2019s really more of something that I won\u2019t even notice, soon, but other than that, it actually exceeds my trusty, well-serving pillow, and I\u2019m happy to say that I LOVE it! I\u2019m going to purchase a few more, and leave one to solely pack for our many trips as hotel pillows are my very own personal hell - at least I now won\u2019t have to worry if they will have a flatter one or have to suffer the ones that make me feel like I\u2019m suffocating. If you are wondering if I\u2019ll hold onto my old, faithful pillow, the answer is yes, but I doubt I\u2019ll have to use it again\u2026 Bottom line is, especially if you are petite, a side sleeper and/or just prefer a flat pillow, this is the one - after probably over a thousand dollars later, and many night of lost sleep, I found this inexpensive one that checks all the boxes wonderfully. A good night\u2019s sleep is priceless, so the journey was worth every cent, but let me help you to not have to go through all of that by just advising you to purchase this one! I\u2019ve done all the work for ya! Enjoy, and have a good night again with the aid of a Blissbury!",
