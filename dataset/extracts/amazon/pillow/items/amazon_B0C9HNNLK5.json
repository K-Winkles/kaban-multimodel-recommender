                "reviewText": "I bought this pillow for my son to replace one of those bamboo pillows that went flat after about 6 months. This pillow is a little thinner than I was expecting, but so far it is holding up really well. I like the cover on it, it is very thick and will repell moisture. My son said it stays cool for him and he has been sleeping much better since using it. The only thing I did not like was that it did emit a smell when we first opened it, which is typical for foam. However, after a few days it dissipated. But great pillow for the price.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Supportive yet soft",
                "reviewText": "I loved the support of my old memory foam pillow compared to regular fluffy pillows. However, it tended to be stiff and dense, and towards the end it was getting worn out, so I bought this as a replacement. What a pleasant surprise that it's everything I hoped it would be! It's thick and supportive but isn't stiff or heavy. I can lie on my side or back, and even my stomach (I change positions frequently so this is perfect), and it conforms to my head without my feeling like I'm sinking into it or only lying on top of it. It's springy and readjusts quickly.When I first took the pillow out of its packaging, I was worried that it was going to be too thin or squishy, but after giving it time to decompress and warm up, it's thick and plush. I can't make any claims as far as pain relief because I've never had problems with pillows except when they're too fluffy. I also don't have a problem with pillows being too warm and this one isn't either, but I appreciate the flip side of the zip-on case that provides a cooler-feeling material for warmer nights.",

The next morning I woke up feeling so dizzy and nauseous I could barely stand. Turns out I was experiencing \"off gasing\" and it was miserable. So buyers please let this pillow air out alot longer than the 6 hours I did before using.",

After sleeping on it the first night, I felt much more relaxed in my jaw and I got a great night sleep. I would recommend this pillow for anyone looking for a nice flat pillow with support but isn't too firm. This pillow has nice cooling action as well and is convenient for travel as well. Overall great purchase!",
