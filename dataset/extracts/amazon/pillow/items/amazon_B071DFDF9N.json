These are nice and fluffy once you let them fill out and don't have any weird packaging smells that I noticed. They seem to hold their fluffiness all night and don't flatten out. I'm a side sleeper so I like a really soft, fluffy pillow so if you like a firm pillow these might not be for you. They kind of envelop your whole head and give nice neck support. The only problem I've noticed is because they wrap around your head they can get a little warm, but I get hot at night and this might not be a problem for non-sweaty sleepers. If it happens, just give it a flip and problem solved! 5 stars - highly recommended.",

They are soft. but plump, yet when I put my head on them they allow my head to sink in just far enough. I don't bottom out so it's like I'm laying on a soft cloud. So glad I bought them. Will be buying more! My granddaughter loves them too. Just the right pillows!",

They arrive unbelievably flat, but once you free them from their plastic prisons, they expand quickly. They're soft but firm. They haven't gone flat the way others would have by now. Plus, one pillow is enough for most people so getting two at this price is a tremendous value. I am absolutely buying more.",

After my first night my ear hurting because there is so much fluff inside there is no room within the fabric to reshape when you put your head on it. We opened one end and removed about 1/3 of the stuffing and now its great. Soft with enough room inside the material to give a little when you put your head on it. My problem is after a while they all usually go flat... I've only had a week so we will see. At least you get two for this price, so even if it does, I have a back up.",
