                "reviewText": "I was finally able to get it right with this pillow! I had tried multiple pillows including Purple Harmony, Sleep Comfort Plush Ultimate, and Big brand and could not find a comfortable sleep. I would end up with neckaches and headaches.However, this pillow works! The adjustability is the key! I appreciate that they offer instructions about how to get the right loft and how your body should be aligned while sleeping. I followed those instructions using my smartphone camera to check the alignment, and then I adjusted over a few days taking out a bit more poof here and there until I got it right. I also appreciate that there is a firmer side and a softer side to this pillow. I realized the firmer side works best for me and gives me the best support while still being cushiony soft at the right loft.This is my first crescent pillow. It took a few days to get used to it, but it works quite well for my side sleeping. It enables me to snuggle deeper into the pillow. I'm not sure that I can ever go back to a regular pillow for side sleeping after this one. I also find the cooling of the Eden+ to be real. The cooling doesn't last long, but it definitely feels cool to the touch when I initially lay my head on it.I actually ended up buying a second Coop pillow because I realized I need a different loft when lying on my back reading, meditating, or on my tablet. This typically occurs before I go to sleep and after I wake up in the morning. I got the regular Eden pillow and adjusted it to a good loft for lying on my back. Thus, I sleep with the regular Eden pillow adjusted for my back as I'm reading before i go to sleep. Once I can no longer keep my eyes open, I switch to the Eden+ crescent pillow for sleeping on my side.Finally, I let the pillow air out after opening but went ahead and slept on it the first night. I then let it continue airing out the second day. I did not have major issues with foam smell.I am glad to have found this very customizable pillow and some relief for my neck and back!",

                "reviewText": "I have had this pillow for two weeks and that has been enough time to realize this is exactly what I needed. I am a hybrid back and side sleeper. I usually fall asleep on my side and move to my back in the night.I was having intense neck pain and decided I needed something. The 100 day return window (which I am still within) was the main reason I decided to try such an expensive pillow. If it didn't work or fit me, I could always return it for a full refund.The shape:The shape is incredibly unique and tailored to how I sleep. The winged arms make it easy to get comfortable on your side. Then naturally when I move onto my back I have a traditional pillow that doesn't get bunched under my neck and shoulders causing me pain in the morning. Just a supportive slope to keep my spine at a relatively straight alignment.The Filling:The fact that you can add or remove the filling is a great feature that will help improve the longevity of the pillow for me. While also allowing me to remove some of the initial stuffing to get the exact fit I wanted. I wish more pillows made this as easy as they are on this pillow. They even include recommendations based on your sleeping style how to leave it stuffed. The filling is designed to cool and not build up heat. Its currently autumn, so I am unable to determine if the cooling is all it is cracked up to be, but I am not finding that I am overheating at night which is new.Overall, its expensive but seems to be worth it.",

                "reviewText": "My receipts from Amazon, Kohl's, and Macy's reflect the vast amount of pillows I've tried and returned over the course of 3 weeks - over 12 different brands/styles - plus going into the Purple store to try out their various pillows (I'm not a fan of 10 lb pillows!!). I've tried numerous goose-down pillows (over $160), down alternate pillows & memory foam (and whatever is in the Purple pillows). NONE of them compare to the soft, luxurious yet supportive features of this Coop Eden Pillow!! I'm a tiny petite woman and sleep both on my back & and my side. Most of the other pillows were just too lofty for my small stature (giving me a headache upon waking in the morning). The down pillows weren't too lofty, but they fill with displaced air on both sides of your head that slowly decompresses - but they're not very supportive and certainly not springy once they compress and once settling, aren't very soft and inviting. The Eden pillow is everything I craved- soft as a cloud yet supportive - super malleable, springy/squishy!! I did have to remove a lot of fill (again, I'm a super tiny human), but how wonderful to be able to adjust a pillow to fit your physical size and comfort desires??!! After all of my hard work in buying, trying out, and returning a LOT of other pillows, I'm so happy to have found the Coop Eden pillow it is truly dreamy perfection!!One other thing - I've read some reviews where people have detected a scent from the memory foam... I have a very sensitive sense of smell and detected NO scent- even when taking some of the foam out of my pillow.KEY FEATURES:1. ADJUSTABLE LOFT2. SOFT as a CLOUD3. MALLEABLE, SPRINGY/SQUISHY4. SUPPORTIVE5. NOT TOO HEAVY6. MACHINE WASHABLE7. LUXURIOUS DREAMY FEELING",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very picky about pillows. Here are my criteria:1. It needs to be soft on the outside. I\u2019m prone to ear/jaw pressure pain, and depending on the night, firm pillows can feel like I\u2019m sleeping on a brick. So it has to fall just within that softness threshold.2. At the same time it as to be supportive at the core, and have a bit of bounce to it, and not sink all the way into the mattress.3. I sleep hot, so it has to be breathable.4. It needs to be configurable enough to have a high-enough loft in case I want to sleep on my side, but can squish down if I want to roll over onto my stomach or back \u2014 because on top of all my other challenges, I sleep in all 3 positions equally!My old down alternative pillow which I had for 15 years, ticked all of those boxes. I don\u2019t even remember where I bought it or what the brand was, but then one day my spouse decided to wash it, and it turned into a lumpy sack of marbles! The tag was completely worn away so I couldn\u2019t even find the make; I suffered with that thing for another year before I started questing for a replacement, and I was surprised how challenging that was. I tried several but nothing came close, and meanwhile I was waking up with headaches most mornings, the side of my head just felt squashed and raw, and I was just not getting enough sleep. It was torture.Finally it came down to the Coop Eden, or the Purple Harmony. Both tick almost all the boxes, but each has a drawback \u2014 the Purple Harmony\u2019s rubber grid material can be rough on sensitive ears, but it\u2019s very cool; whereas the Eden has enough give to spare the side of my head, but can get warm despite what the product description says about cooling gel.Ultimate I went with the latter, because there\u2019s a workaround for its one drawback: Coop sells a very effective cooling pillowcase, the combination of which is almost perfect. It feels immediately cool, and while it won\u2019t keep the spot you\u2019re lying on cool forever, it does magically prevent it from getting excessively warm. Moreover if you move away from the spot, it will cool down again very quickly \u2014 meaning that you can just move to cooler spots on the pillow every few mins until you fall asleep and no longer care, and not wake up in a sweat!I\u2019ve only had it for a couple days, but there\u2019s no adjustment period. I knew the moment I tried it I\u2019d finally found a replacement for my old perfect pillow. For the first time in ages, I had a really great sleep and didn\u2019t wake up with a neck/head ache. This thing\u2019s a game changer, especially if you\u2019re a difficult customer like myself.One other thing to note: Reviewers have reported a chemical smell, and mine had a bit of that even after putting it through the drier as instructed, but weirdly, it smells almost like chocolate! Maybe it would have been worse had I not tumble dried it first, but I actually kind of don\u2019t mind it! And my wife independently verified the chocolate scent as well when I asked her what she thought it smelled like. I suspect it will fade over the next few days, but at least in the meantime I\u2019m having sweet dreams!",

I like the fact that you can pull the filler out (and it fits in the extra filler bag that they provide!). My one recommendation, if you do need to pull any filler out, make sure you pull it out across the entire length of the pillow. I pulled out the middle section and for a night or two there was a massive dip in the middle no matter how much I 'floofed' the pillow, but it sorted itself out after that!",
