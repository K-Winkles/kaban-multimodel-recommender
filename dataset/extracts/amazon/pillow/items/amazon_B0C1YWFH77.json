Even after opening and shaking and attempting to fluff them up they are hard and flat and lumpy. This product is totally misrepresented and I am furious that I have to deal with returning a product that should never have been shipped.I have to give a star just to submit the review, but these pillows should not have any stars. AWFUL, TERRIBLE, HORRID.",
