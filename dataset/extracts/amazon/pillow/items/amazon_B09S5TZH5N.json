                "reviewText": "I had my doubts about this pillow. I have tried A LOT of pillows and have had constant neck pain. When I finally laid down I couldn\u2019t stop moving and thought FOR SURE I was going to throw it on the floor at like 1am.I haven\u2019t slept on ONE pillow since maybe I was a baby BUT\u2026 on the first night I slept great!! and didnt have any additional neck pain!I did not move from the center of the pillow, besides the occasional roll to my side. It seriously cradles you into the middle of the pillow and fully supports your neck. (I am a back and side sleeper) the grooves on the side fully support your shoulders so you don\u2019t end up with numbness in your arms or shoulders when you\u2019re on your sides.I also slept on the more raised side, which I did not anticipate. I thought I would sleep on the lower side.I MAYBE would have bought the king size\u2026 but then again, I didn\u2019t move out of that one spot, so I\u2019m not sure I need the pillow to be any bigger. Since buying this pillow about a week ago, I have bought two more: one for my boyfriend who has stolen and slept with it, and my daughter who is also obsessed. 4 of my friends have also bought the pillow as well.I would say, if you have been searching for a pillow because of neck pain.. don\u2019t wait, try this pillow. You will NOT be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Over the last 3 months, I have purchased and returned 8 different cervical pillows (not including this one). And this did end up being the overall winner.I\u2019ll be honest, this wasn\u2019t the final one I bought. In fact, at first I didn\u2019t want to keep it. It worked wonders for my snoring, I was tossing and turning less, and when I did turn, I would naturally move into the ideal place for the position I was in. Furthermore, the curves that allow for you to put your arms up at your side are the best designed out of any of the options I tried.However, the first several days, I did wake up with really bad neck pain that persisted throughout most of the day. At first, it was enough to look for other options. But the other options were either to soft and not supportive enough, or only really good if you were sure to stay sleeping on your back all night. So I eventually decided to give this another try, and I am so glad I did. This definitely feels different and is a much firmer pillow than most others. And it is higher up, which probably contributed to the neck pain initially. But after a few more nights sleep with it, either I just got used to it, or maybe was making sure I was in the most ideal position compared to before.No matter what the reason is, I am glad I stuck with it. After 3-4 nights tops, I have yet to wake up with the neck pain like I had at first. And I\u2019m not tossing and turning, snoring much less, and overall just getting a better nights sleep",

                "reviewText": "I have suffered with cervical neck and shoulder pain for years now. I have used another memory foam pillow in the past and had no issues. I received this pillow and was super excited to use it for the first time. I decided to give it a few days to air out like the directions say. That 1 night I slept on it I slept so good. I was comfortable and felt supported. However, i dont know what happened but it DESTROYED my face and neck. I woke up to my entire lower jaw/face/neck/upper chest COVERED in a rash. It was so painful. This was 1 month ago and I am still recovering. I had to be prescribed steroid pills, steroid creams, an antibiotic lotion and an oral antibiotic. Let\u2019s not forget an antifungal for the yeast infection I developed due to the oral antibiotic. I did not sleep on this pillow again and went back to my old memory foam pillow. I dont know what happened and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the pillows fault. I am probably just sensitive to some type of chemical that\u2019s in this thing. It did have a strong chemical smell. Even after letting it air out. I wanted to return it. However, I had throw out the manufacturer packaging and with Amazon you aren\u2019t able to return an item without that. I\u2019m at week 4 tho and my neck is still broken out but slowly recovering. I did give the pillow 3 stars because it is comfortable and well made. I slept well on it that one time. I didn\u2019t care for the chemical smell even after days of letting it air out. Just be careful.",
