Not as good as my old soft pillow but that has gotten thin over the years. I think that although it has a cotton outside the cotton is too stiff, I hope it will soften up over time.",

The pillow itself once you\u2019re laying down is supportive enough and I do get a good nights sleep but it is not as springy as I\u2019d like. Overall it\u2019s an interesting combination and I\u2019m not sure how to feel about it or if its description is accurate. Not for those looking for that fluffy and soft hotel pillow. It\u2019s like a fluffy pillow with a hard shell.",
