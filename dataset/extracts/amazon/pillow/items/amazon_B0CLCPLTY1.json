                "reviewText": "First off, this pillow is very large and a bit heavy. I can fit my whole leg on it, which I can tell is good for my posture. Its the size of a normal pillow, but the memory foam definitely holds its shape better than my other pillows.The down sides are that it STINKS! Upon opening it, it smelled like VOCs. I let it sit for a few days before taking it into my bedroom, which helped a little. Because of the size and shape its very comfortable while I lay on my side, but a bit awkward when I flip to the other side and very awkward if I want to sleep on my back. It is too high to keep under my knees if I'm on my back, so I have to push it to the side.It does what its supposed to do, and hopefully the smell will continue to dissipate so its not a problem.UPDATE:After a few more days, I determined that the weight is a deal breaker. While it takes stress of the hips and spine, it put more pressure on my knees. It may not be a problem for everyone, but the knee discomfort was a deal breaker for me(my knees weren't back to normal until part way through the next day). I've switched back to using a small pillow with normal, lighter stuffing for my legs and my knees are feeling better. The smell finally dissipated and now this makes a great pillow for under the head.",

It's so comfortable that it could smell terrible forever, and I do not think I would mind.The fabric's threading is tight and very soft, and it is very cool on my face. I've been waking up with a little less neck pain--not necessarily because it's simply an ortho pillow, but because of its perfect balance of firmness to the touch and pillowy support with moldability around the head, neck, and face.",

I was using a regular one but it just wasn't thick enough and I wanted a longer pillow to protect both my knees and ankles better. This pillow fits my requirements perfectly! I'm very pleased with it, I tried it for a nap today and it's exactly what I was looking for. The thickness at 4 inches is much better and I also quite like the firmness of the pillow. It comes in a compressed roll and as soon as it's let out it inflates fast, no issues whatsoever. I used it about an hour after and it was already fully decompressed. I recommend!",
