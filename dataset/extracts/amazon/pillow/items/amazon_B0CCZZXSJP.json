                "reviewText": "I love this pillow. It is sooo comfortable. I have spinal stenosis in my neck and it caused numb hands while I sleep. My physical therapist recommended a body pillow to raise my top leg and rest my arm above my body, basically it straightens my spine while I sleep and prevents the pinching that causes the numbness. This pillow has solved my ailment and is cooling to boot. No more numb hands. I actually bought two so I can flip over from left side sleeping to right side midway through the night and not have to move the pillow over. I had to take quite a bit of stuffing out of it so it's really nice to be able to do that...many of the pillows on the market don't have the zip closure. The only downside is that it can't be washed, but everything else about it is worth it. Five star.",
