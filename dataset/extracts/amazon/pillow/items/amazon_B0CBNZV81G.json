                "reviewText": "This is by far the best pillow I\u2019ve had to put between my knees to sleep. My husband bought me one last year and I liked it but it was just to bulky and I have to be cool when I sleep. You can put this between your knees or legs and lay in any position and it works. I had a knee replacement and I can\u2019t stand the feeling of my knees on top of the other because I sleep sideways. Easy to wash and it\u2019s very sturdy but soft. I don\u2019t put mine in the dryer but you can. Love it!!",
