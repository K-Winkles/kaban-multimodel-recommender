                "reviewText": "I think these are quite nice, lightweight, quality Sealy pillow protectors...to me, they're like an almost \"medium\" type of thickness...I have cotton pillow protectors that are thicker than these (which are similar to an almost cotton \"canvas\" type of thickness, but are softer than canvas material, & they're more for \"allergy\" protection)...and I also have bamboo pillow protectors that are slightly thinner than these, which are good for Summertime use to keep my pillow cooler. So I think these Sealy pillow protectors are a good \"in between\" type of quality, lightweight thickness if you aren't looking for real thick pillow protectors! :)These aren't meant to provide \"allergy protection\" but using even thin/lightweight pillow protectors is better than using none at all. I haven't washed these yet to put them on my king size pillow yet, but I held them up to my pillow & they seem to be an adequate size to fit the pillow, but my king size pillow isn't an overly thick one either. I think these are nice-looking, good quality pillow protectors that seem well made...the zipper is a quality metal zipper (not plastic) & it opened & closed easily on both pillow protectors & none of the pillow cover gets snagged in the zipper while opening & closing it.There's tags inside of both pillow covers stating they're 100% cotton & showing they're Sealy made (& apparently made in the U.S.A. in Pennsylvania, so that's great!!) They come wrapped in Sealy plastic & in sealed paperboard Sealy packaging with a Sealy card inside to contact Sealy if you have an issues with the product, etc. So you can be sure these are indeed made by Sealy!The washing instructions are on the tags & say warm water wash & dry on low heat. If you're worried about them shrinking, I'd say to wash them on cool water the first time you wash them instead of warm. (I've learned that sometimes washing cotton items on cool water the first time kind of \"pre-washes/preps\" them so that they're less likely to shrink as much when I do wash them in warm water in future washings.)I think these are very nice pillow protectors if you want lightweight ones for Spring/Summer/Fall use or if you just don't like a thicker/bulky pillow covers! :) They have a stylish \"striped\" pattern to their fabric that makes them look a bit more \"fancy\" than just plain/solid white pillow covers.",
