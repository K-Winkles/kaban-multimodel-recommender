                "reviewText": "Over the years, I have spent a lot of time and money buying pillows. I can never seem to find one that fits my needs. I thought this would be a good option to try because this came up as a top rated pillow from consumer reports.I really think this pillow might be the last pillow I ever need. I saw all the good reviews and I also read all the bad reviews. Pillows are very personal, and a pillow that works for one person may not work for the other person but, I decided to give this a try.I was so excited. This was on sale at Amazon and I got it same day. I have a lot of neck issues and pinched nerves so I thought this pillow would help. Once I took it out of the box, I fluffed it up by hand because I don\u2019t have a dryer. Within 15 minutes the pillow was really fluffy. I tested it out. I\u2019m a side sleeper. It didn\u2019t work too well. I removed some of the stuffing which is luxuriously soft. And it seemed to be comfortable. This morning I woke up with a horrible neck and headache. So, I took a little more stuffing out. It seems to feel better now. This gives just the right amount of support. It doesn\u2019t give too much pushback and it also doesn\u2019t go flat. Yes, this will flatten out a little bit when you lay your head on it, but not completely to the mattress flat. I fluff it up before I go to bed and it works great. I think I have it at just the right thickness but we will see how it goes. Surprisingly, it was not too hot for me like others have reported. I do have a temperature control system on the bed so maybe that\u2019s why the pillow temperature didn\u2019t bother me as much. I did not have any pain in my ears from sleeping on a hard pillow. That was a big plus. It gives Justin enough support and not too much pressure so it\u2019s perfect. The outer shell is really nice. The shell and zippers seem to be good quality. I still use a genuine silk pillowcase because I like it. I think this is my forever pillow. I will add an update after I use it for a while if anything changes. I am hoping for good durability. Last thing, this also comes with extra stuffing if you like your pillow, extra high, or if your pillow starts to go flat, you have more stuffing to put in it. Putting your pillow out in the sun or in the dryer once every couple of months will help to keep it fluffy. I don\u2019t think I would ever wash the foam on the inside. There\u2019s no reason for that. The outer shell is what\u2019s going to get most dirty.Just know, I liked it so much I bought another one immediately.",

                "reviewText": "I have had two different styles from this brand.The first one was the crescent style original, and I was REALLY hoping that it would be the end all be all for me. I played around with the filling, but somehow I just ended up with a sore neck no matter what I did. I had no issues with it sleeping hot, but I just couldn't figure out how to get the right level of support with this style.I also purchased the original that was in the more traditional pillow style. This one seems to be working out better for me, but I did end up having to add more filling to it. I sleep on my side, back, and stomach, so it can be tricky to find a sweet spot for pillow height. It seemed like the filling for this pillow was not quite as soft as my crescent pillow, and it looked a bit different, too. The pillow is very comfortable, though.I love the covers on both styles. it is very plush and soft. It feels great when I am sleeping.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Long Term 4 Year Review",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the Coop Home Goods Premium Adjustable Loft Shredded Memory Foam pillow for the first time in December 2016.I have a big head, literally (not figuratively), and a side-sleeper. Growing up, my mom had an old fashion feather pillow that would stab my neck and face. It started my journey into finding a good pillow. I tried using Polyester filled Pillows but they were not properly supporting my neck and head while sleeping. Then I tried one of those solid memory foam pillow, but it was not high enough or soft enough for a comfortable side-sleep. I would toss and turn throughout the night, or wake up from neck and shoulder cramps. So I went on Amazon and purchased the Coop Pillow almost 3 years ago hoping the reviews were true and the high loft and soft shredded memory foam would help support my giant head.When I first received the Coop Pillow, the pillow was vacuum sealed and had a foam chemical smell which lasted for about 3 days before disappearing. I recommend airing it out before using it. It also had a very high loft, and the Breathable Pillowcase it came with was excellent. Even after 2.5 years, the Pillowcase is still excellent. The materials are unique, still super soft, breathable, and great to touch. 5 out of 5 stars for the Pillowcase.The first year of using the Coop Pillow made my sleep significantly better. I slept through the whole night, and no longer had neck or shoulder pains. The loft of the pillow was high enough and soft enough that my life as a side-sleeper became heaven on earth. The stuffing/filling, shredded memory foam, had such an interesting feel. It was soft like a polyester pillow, moved like a feathered pillow, but when pressed down was dense enough to support the head and neck like one of those solid memory foam pillows. The first year of my Coop Pillow was 5 out of 5 stars experience.The second year of using the Coop Pillow, the loft was not as high as it use to be but it still provided great side-sleeping support. I\u2019ve had to re-fluff the pillow about 3 times since I bought it. I\u2019ve read to throw the pillow into the washer or dryer to get the loft back, but I\u2019ve never tried that. I re-fluff the pillow by dumping out all of the stuffing/filling and thoroughly breaking it up by hand before putting it back into the provided Pillowcase. It\u2019s the only real way to bring the fluffiness back; you have to break up the filling inside the pillow. I\u2019m not sure that a washer or a dryer can (by tumbling it around, or even spinning it) get those shredded memory foam pieces to thoroughly separate. During the second year of using the Coop Pillow, I re-fluffed the stuffing twice and it more or less went back to it\u2019s original shape. Towards the end of the second year I noticed the pillow had gotten flat, half it\u2019s original size. It\u2019s to be expected. Our heads weigh about the size of a bowling ball (mine probably two) and if you laid a bowling ball on the Coop Pillow for 8 hours every day for 600+ days, flattening is inevitable. I\u2019m not expecting Coop Pillow to defy gravity and physics. I would rate the second year of my Coop pillow 4 out of 5 stars.By the start of the third year of using the Coop Pillow, I noticed that the stuffing was starting to clump together into one giant solid piece of memory foam. It no longer had that fluffy polyester-style bounce. I could grab the pillow, shake it, and it would jiggle like one giant solid jello-like piece of foam. I re-fluffed it manually about 3 weeks ago and noticed the the dark yellowing of the shredded foam when it use to be off-white (cream sort of color). It is normal for memory foam to yellow however it seems like this is visible sign of the foam aging, losing its properties, and being unable to function like it once did. So the pillow went from fluffy to solid jello within a week and its flattening significantly faster. You will have to re-fluff this pillow once every one to two weeks by the 2.5 year mark.For the past 3 months or so, I haven\u2019t had the kind of sleep that I did in the beginning with the Coop Pillow. Lucky for me, last year I purchased Coop Pillows for my parents. The loft was too high for my mother, so her Coop Pillow is sitting around as a decorative throw; practically untouched. I swapped my flattened Coop Pillow for her pristine Coop Pillow and we\u2019re both happier for it. She\u2019s finally using her Coop Pillow (my old pillow) to sleep on.Overall, I would rank the Coop Pillow as a 3.5 out of 5 stars after 2.5 years of use.I think it\u2019s a great pillow to try for side-sleepers and something only back-sleepers will appreciate after 2 years when it flattens. My only concerns are possibly having to re-purchase this pillow every 2 years to get the continued side-sleeping support. I just can\u2019t see myself having to re-fluff this every week, it takes me an hour each time to manually break apart all of the stuffing. I wonder about whether or not shredded memory foam is easily recyclable and good for the environment if I have to throw this pillow away? That\u2019s something I have reservations about. I\u2019m using my mom\u2019s Coop Pillow for now, and I know I\u2019ll have good sleep for the next two years while she\u2019s using my old Coop Pillow.Lately, after becoming a more conscious consumer, I not only think about the price, quality, and usability of my purchases but also the durability and recyclability of such products. If it won\u2019t be recycled, will it at least biodegrade? So, to end this review let me just say that I do love my Coop Pillow but I won\u2019t be repurchasing for the following reasons:1. I\u2019m a side-sleeper and I would have to repurchase this pillow every 2 years2. I\u2019m concerned about the shredded memory foam not being recyclable3. I\u2019m concerned about whether the brand has some kind of product life-cycle program and consideration without resorting to dumping it in landfills (or developing countries) or is easily biodegradable.4. I would like to purchase a pillow that not only gives side-sleep support but also has additional health benefits. Preferably something natural, durable, and ethical in the sourcing of such materials as well as being easily biodegradable at the tail end of its life (Im considering Organic, 100% Natural, Un-Dyed, Un-Bleached Linen Pillows stuffed with Flax Fibers for my next purchase)5. I want to try something that\u2019s different and better. Something that not only benefits me, but also is not a net negative for people, animals, and the environment.In closing, I\u2019ll say that for the price and what it gives for the first two years, it\u2019s worth a try. I hope this review helps everyone make a purchase decision. Thanks Coop Home Goods!April 2021 Update: After 4 years, I've updated my 3 Star rating to 4 Stars.I've had some users ask me for an update:I did end up purchasing that Flax Linen Pillow through Etsy from a small business owner in the Ukraine on June 2019. Much of the organic flax linens being grown and processed these days are from Lithuania. It's been about 1.5 years and the Linen Pillow has flattened out, quite quickly, within 6 months. I still love the Linen Pillow for its health benefits but have opted to use it as a topper on my Coop Home Goods Pillow. I also sometimes swap its use from a topper to a body pillow.In summation, I haven't found anything better than Coop Home Goods for a side sleeper. I think most businesses aren't excited about pillow technology, but I hope that Coop Home Goods continues to explore new materials, recyclability, and processes to improve upon what they already have.This is my last update on this product, sleep tight everyone and good night \ud83d\ude34",
