        "description": "Elaine Karen Vinyl Pillow Protectors Elaine Karen\u2019s Vinyl Pillow Protectors are an inexpensive way to manage dust mite and bed bug infestation and common conditions brought by such allergens. By adding a protective barrier to your pillows, you can ensure a more comfortable and restful sleep. What People Love these Pillow Covers? More than the fact that they are very affordable, these pillowcases do what a pillow protector is supposed to do. They work 2 jobs by keeping your pillows safe from stains and bugs while keeping you protected against allergens. Aside from that, here are the features that make Elaine Karen\u2019s Vinyl Pillow Encasement a must-have: Made with Heavy-Duty Vinyl With its strong stitches and extra-durable seams, our pillowcases create a solid surface that is impossible to be penetrated with liquid spills, bed bugs, and dust mites. Thus, you can ensure that whatever\u2019s inside the case stays inside, what\u2019s outside stays out. Therefore, we can say that our Pillow Protectors are 100% Waterproof, Bedbug-Proof, and Dust-Mite-Proof! Total Protection with Zipper Enclosure To ensure effectiveness in wicking away bodily fluids, liquid spillage, and allergens, we integrate our pillow covers with a rust-proof zipper enclosure. Now, everything\u2019s sealed for maximum bedding protection! Washable and Reusable Most manufacturers designed their Vinyl Pillowcases for single use. But not with Elaine Karen\u2019s! Our Pillowcases can be washed and reused multiple times. Plus, they are super easy to clean. They are safe for machine washing and handwashing. They even easily wipe clean with a damp cloth!",

                "reviewText": "I bring my own pillows when I spend a few months house sitting for someone who has a sweet dog that I have a very mild allergic reaction to.I want my inner pillow materials \"sealed\" & protected from any dander, fur or other allergens.I read some comments (they were fyi's, not really complaints) about the air getting trapped for a bit as you lay your head down. Makes sense if the zipper zips completely to the end without any gaps. It would defeat my confidence of protection if the air freely escapes.On that note, I ordered larger cases to allow more room for trapped air billowing & bubbling as I lay my head down (Initially, I also pressed out all the excess air before zipping closed...so far, that has helped the issue but, not sure for how long.)I also put TWO fabric cases over the vinyl case to muffle/lessen any soft plastic-y sound, adding an extra fabric layer to cushion the feel & sound. This also helps mask that mild \"new\" vinyl scent which I expect to fade away in a day or so.My main goal of well protected pillows seems to have been met therefore, any slight sound I hear, hasn't bothered me at all.So far, I have no complaints about this purchase.I'll update this review if the durability disappoints with tears or malfunctioning zippers.I don't really expect any vinyl, soft enough for comfort & with a sewn in zipper, to withstand nightly pillow use or in my case abuse, lol ...but, I do expect it to last long enough to be worth the money I put into it!ZZZzzzzz G'Night :)",

                "reviewText": "As I have children with allergies and we've had 2 neighbors come up with bedbugs, I decided to order some of these. As a household of 8 with at least 2 pillows for each person, I had to buy multiple packs. But boy was I disappointed and unimpressed when each pack had at least 1 cover with a hole already in them. Some even ripped open when sticking pillows (which were smaller than description recommended) inside. Had 2 bust open from just laying your head on them. But I decided to tough it out with the ones that stayed together. Which wasn't bad until approximately 2 weeks in and even those started ripping open. So, instead of letting money go to waste, I clear taped the holes. Only for another sem to open up a little later. So all in all it's either trash them or tape them up. (Which we have.) Now if the producer would just make the product a bit bigger and stop stitching the sem so close to the edge, the product might actually hold together and be worth it. Hope this helps someone save their money and time!",
