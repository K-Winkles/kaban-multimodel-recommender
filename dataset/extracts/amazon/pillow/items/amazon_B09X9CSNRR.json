The polycotton filling strikes a perfect balance, providing a comfortable and supportive feel. They are ideal for both decorative use on the sofa and for adding extra comfort to the bed.The hypoallergenic feature is a definite plus, ensuring a worry-free experience for those with sensitivities. The white color of the inserts is versatile, effortlessly blending with various decor styles. It's a clean and classic choice that complements any throw pillow cover or case.The 18\" x 18\" size is just right \u2013 not too bulky, yet substantial enough to make a visual impact. The pillows maintain their shape well, and the stitching is sturdy, indicating good overall quality.What I appreciate most is the set of four, providing a cost-effective solution for multiple pillows. Whether it's for decorating different areas of the home or creating a cohesive look on the sofa, having a set of four is convenient.In terms of value, the MENGT Throw Pillow Inserts offer a great deal for the price.

                "reviewText": "Boy was I surprised by the size of these....they were very flat (compressed) when I got them...I took them out and fluffed them some and put them in dryer per the directions. They fluffed up very nicely. I got 20x20 pillows go in 18x18 cases so they would be extra fluffy. These fluffed up so big I barely got them in the cases! Never had that issue in the past. Definitely recommend these but get the correct size instead of sizing up!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not sure what people are talking about when they say these 18 x18\u201d pillow forms, are not full enough for an 18x18\u201d pillow cover. After I took them out of the packaging, I used my hands to pull the fiber fill apart, and put the pillows in the dryer with dryer balls and a damp dish towel. I set it on low heat and it ran for 33 minutes. When I took them out of the dryer, they were the perfect size and fullness for my 18x18\u201d pillow covers. It took a little work to get them stuffed evenly distributed within the cover, but now they look fantastic!",
