                "reviewText": "Im 50 years old, 250 lbs and 5\"10 female. I'm a side sleeper, I've always had numbness on my arms, shoulders, even legs, lower back pain and not to mention cramps! Every night I can feel the cramps coming so I stretch again until it goes away. The worse thing every morning for me was my lower back pain! UNTILL I purchased this side pillow using my FSA !! OHH EMM GEE! How does this pillow know all my curves and molds it to body from front to back! I know its just half a u shape but the short end of the pillow meets to almost the lower part of my back and the comfort this pillow provides my body is firm enough to give it support and soft enough to mold my shoulders , neck and head on the pillow! I woke up with no back pain, no cramps, no soreness on my body for the first time !!! I swear this is crazy to confess but this started the first day I used this candy cane looking body pillow!My \"WTF\" Moment- My dog passed away not long ago, he was my roll dog and he went just about everywhere I went. The first day I was using this pillow, I was getting into my comfort spot in the pillow (adjusting pillow location to my body and then my blanket) before watching TV from my bed. As soon as I found my comfort position, and started watching TV, I immediately felt a huge weight lifting away from me and felt so secure and comforted like I was being hugged ! Mind you, I hate tight spaces, crowds, and just feeling I can't breathe... BUT this moment didn't feel like that, I was cozy snugged in between a fat candy cane pillow that made me feel so safe and very relieved and happy!! I've never felt this way since my dog passed and realized this was anxiety , it all happened so fast I just about broke down and cried ..the feeling of a heavy weight lifting from me at that point was my \"wtf\" moment. All because of a stupid pillow .. seriously!?? Crazy ! Anyway, I've never slept soooo comfortably in a LONG TIME !!!! I was overwhelmed. I smiled all day just how great I feel from a great night sleep ! It's amazing ! I think some people complain it's firm because it is but i think my weight and height has something to do with the awesome comfort!!! I just got this a couple days ago, so I can do an update a month from now to see if the pillow still holds up firmly but as for now, I'm blown away and a true believer now that pillows are life changing !Just an FYI- I have the therepudic pillows, neck pillow, long foam body pillow.. I've tried all these different expensive pillows and NONE has ever made me feel like this not has any taken away my aches. BIG DIFFERENCE !",

I always thought these were just for pregnant women, but I had some extra FSA I needed to use before the end of the year, and this pillow popped up on the FSA eligible items. Boy am I glad that it did, because let me tell you...I get the best sleep I have EVER had in my life with this thing!! It's like crawling onto your own little cloud to sleep. You feel comfy, snug as a bug in a rug. I wake up more rested because I don't toss and turn anymore. My body feels better too because of it. I don't think I could live without this pillow now. I also recommend getting the pillow case for it to protect the pillow a bit. It's pretty easy to get on. Hands down one of my favorite purchases of 2023!",

                "reviewText": "My husband got me one of these a few years ago to use up the fsa and I love it so much I talked him into getting one. He spotted one that was a bit cheaper but I persuaded him to stick with this one. I spent a lot of time in bed for nearly a year and this pillow isn\u2019t worn out at all. I was nervous about washing the cover because I thought it would be really difficult to get it back on the pillow. It takes a few minutes. You have to set about the task with an attitude that this is going to take more than a few seconds but it\u2019s really not that difficult or time consuming. We had extra fsa so we got another for me just because of pure laziness. So I don\u2019t have to maneuver the pillow when I want to turn over but I\u2019ve ended up not using it. I\u2019ll save it for when this one does eventually wear out. It\u2019s on year 3 and still very comfortable. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that they have covers you can get in a few different colors but they are super expensive.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my boyfriend who uses 4 pillows to sleep. Due to the hook in the design, it doesn't go down to his feet and since the pillow is so puffy - it adds great support to his knees, but then makes his feet hang, which was a weird sensation. It is hefty in weight. To return it would cost $22.Did buy the L/XL for him and he is 6ft tall. And lays with his legs bent.Pillow is very fluffy.",

I can finally say I was able to sleep more than 2 hours without having to keep adjusting myself. The pillow is full and super soft. I'll probably keep using it even after pregnancy!",
