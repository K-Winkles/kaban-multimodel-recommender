                "reviewText": "I let it fluff up a few days in a spare bedroom before using. Seemed pretty thick but when laying upon it it went down appropriately. I felt the inside and could feel a gel type lining mixed with fluff. Beautiful design and sharp sleep threading. Defiantly higher quality material and stitching. Sift as all feel. Cool to the touch. First night I knew it would be different as I\u2019ve been using a harder memory foam which has not been good for my neck. Then I bought softer plain pillows that turned into pancakes within weeks that also weren\u2019t good for my neck. Lol. Then I bought the my pillow pillow which felt like sleeping on tons of foam pieces but was better then the other two but it was not smooth and soft and comfy at all. Strike 3. At that point I was just sick of the pillow roulette game. Soooo I started researching the web on what pillows were out there and why they were better or worse. Studies showed that a mixed gel type Fiber filling pillow was best. Fluff with gel fibers or fluff with foam fibers or any number of those combinations. Density was a big thumbs up. But to many pillows are overfilled so then thumbs down. Down pillows were a suggested good choice also but I didn\u2019t enjoy the occasional prick of a feather piece in my face nor the idea I was sleeping on birds so I stopped getting them. In summer they\u2019d make me sweat. Seems like getting a pillow perfect is a tough business. Everyone\u2019s different so some like them flatter some like them fatter. The choices and options are endless of course. But it seems from data of pulled research from across the US that most or more people preferred after sleep tests a pillow that had fluff and gel type fiber filling. I thought they probably would be a fortune but at this point I\u2019d pay it to rest. So I then went to Amazon my go to for everythinggggg- (love Amazon) and this pillow had a lot of great user reviews and then a friend told me tons of hotel chains use them, and then my daughter said she\u2019d had them on all her beds. WHO KNEW! But for 40 bucks for two nice pillows I figured what the heck! First nights on a new pillow are always weird. I learned long ago you can\u2019t base any opinion on one night on a mattress or blankets or a pillow. I thought it might not be thick enough at first because I was by then used to a hard memory foam pillow. But it was pretty nice but I needed to wait a few more nights to see. When you pick it up it has a nice middle weight. Not to heavy like my memory foam ones or my down ones. Night two I moved it around a lot and snuggled my face into it and it was soooo nice. After a bit I did doze off and woke up a few times trying to get comfy with a new pillow. Night three I was over tired laid right down and crashed and woke up thinking oh my gosh that\u2019s a nice pillow after all. Night four was perfect. I am supported just enough, but not to much. It\u2019s a solid pillow but not to bulky like memory foam. It does depress to conform but not flatten. It\u2019s cool to the skin and I don\u2019t overheat. It keeps its shape after you sleep on it. It fluffs back up when you make your bed and leave it. I don\u2019t sink in but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m laying on a huge rubber mound. It\u2019s pretty much the perfect pillow for me personally and I\u2019m a picky pillow person. Lol. This is just my unbiased review that others may or may not agree with but for me- it\u2019s a 5 star! If your looking for a super supportive firmer pillow this isn\u2019t it. If your looking for a softer no filling type pillow this isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s right in between with enough of perfect combination of everything. I sleep on all positions changing through the night so this one works great for me.",

                "reviewText": "So I waited awhile for these. I knew that when I ordered how long it would take. It just took so long cuz it was so worth it!!! Trust me, these are nice. Husband and I fell asleep so fast the first night we got them. It\u2019s the right amount of firmness and softness. I tend to like mine on the firm side while my husband likes it soft. I\u2019ve used them for a few weeks. It still has kept its shape. I just think it\u2019s more firm now and not as soft. So I switch between my softer pillow and this one. I\u2019m considering the softer version of this one. Maybe I might go the full feather ones to please my husband. Then we have both kinds to switch between the two and everyone is happy. I will pay good money for good quality pillows. These for the value is worth the splurge.",

                "reviewText": "I loved my first set of these pillows \u2014 soft, but supportive, and have lasted much longer than most pillows of similar cost. However, my second set were stiffer, and never really settled. I use one as a back pillow, and the other as a dog pillow, so either my second pair were a new design or bad batch (in comparison). Worth the money either way, just unexpected to have the same pillows feel so different",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Long review, but I'd recommend these Sleep Restoration/Beckham Hotel pillows.",
                "reviewText": "OK, let's clear up a few things:1) I am a real buyer, was not given this pillow, was not paid to review this pillow. There's no way I'm doing any of that.2) I want everyone to know exactly what I'm giving an opinion on. This \"Beckham Hotel\" pillow is the very same as others called \"Sleep Restoration Super Plush Gel-Fiber Filled Pillows\". That's what the package the two pillows (costing $35 total) came in reads, and there's a small bar-coded sticker with tiny writing indicating the Beckham Hotel re-branding.3) There's NO smell. There's NO mildew. They arrived factory clean and shipped in a nice, zipped plastic container bag.4) They arrive dead flat. When you remove them, they start to fluff up. I'd say after an hour or so they are ready to use. Fluff them a bit, and you can sleep on them right away. It's not necessary to put them in a dryer and in fact it could be detrimental. Not sure.5) I waited a month to write this because I wanted to be sure I liked the pillows. I do!6) I had some doubts at first because I thought they'd be too soft, but after a couple of nights I would now describe them as soft, yet firm enough to support my head and neck correctly. I start out sleeping on my side and of course, at some point end up on my back, and then often back on my side.7) They're heavy enough to no move around, but not heavy like a (solid) memory foam pillow is. They stay put in other words.8) I purchased the queen sized ones. Now, it was sort of interesting to me that these are 20 inches wide, and yet a queen size pillowcase is also 20 inches wide. Yet, a pillow is quite high and a pillowcase is of course - flat. This means it requires some effort to squeeze the pillow into the pillowcase. BUT, perhaps this makes the pillow seem a bit firmer than my initial impression of it was in paragraph #6. At any rate, it works and these have worked out well for me.9) I woke up in a hotel about 4 years ago with neck pain and had it ever since. All sorts of chiropractic efforts, daily neck stretches, painkillers, etc. just didn't seem to get rid of it. I ditched my Tempur-Pedic s-shaped solid memory foam pillow and tried several other pillows I got locally. They all went back. I got these pillows, continued on the daily neck stretches and now I'm feeling fine with no more neck pain. I noticed about a week ago I was waking up with no more neck pain. That's a relief.That's about all I can tell you Amazon shoppers. Buying a pillow is a wilderness of choice. I spent a LOT of hours on here looking. And of course pillows, and the comfort of them, is very personal and subjective. I can only say, for me, these worked out. If they don't for you, I assume you can return them, possibly with some shipping cost. I don't know. I'm not a regular Amazon customer and not a Prime member.Best of luck finding yours!-MSW",

I needed a pillow that gave good neck support so I didn\u2019t buy this pillow initially because I didn\u2019t think it would. Not only is it soft and fluffy and unbelievably comfortable, but it supports my neck perfectly. It doesn\u2019t flatten down. It keeps its shape and buoyancy. I don\u2019t know what it is about this pillow that makes it so perfect, but I\u2019m so glad I purchased it. I plan on stocking up with a few more just in case they stop making them. Love this pillow!",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe diese Kissen aufgrund der positiven Bewertungen und des unschlagbaren Preises erworben, da ich nicht viel Geld f\u00fcr Kopfkissen ausgeben wollte. Seit langem war ich auf der Suche nach neuen Kissen f\u00fcr mein Bett, um endlich einen erholsamen Schlaf zu finden. Ich habe bereits zahlreiche Nackenkissen ausprobiert und hatte jede Nacht einen unangenehmen Schlaf, bis ich diese fantastischen Kissen entdeckt habe. Seit dem ersten Tag schlafe ich wie ein Engel \u2013 sie sind unglaublich angenehm, weich, nicht zu hoch und nicht zu platt. Die Kissen behalten ihre Form bei und sind einfach grandios.Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass diese Kissen nicht riesig oder extrem dick sind. Ich kann sie nur empfehlen und widerspreche einer negativen Bewertung hier. Der Geruch beim Auspacken ist ganz normal, wie bei jedem anderen neuen Artikel. Er riecht einfach \"NEU\". Falls Sie also nach preiswerten Kissen suchen, sollten Sie unbedingt zuschlagen! Sie erhalten sogar 2 St\u00fcck f\u00fcr den Preis. Nein, ich erhalte nichts f\u00fcr diese Rezension \u2013 dies ist meine freie Meinung zu diesem Produkt. Ich w\u00fcrde es immer wieder kaufen.",
