But in my opinion they are too soft. Other reviews had stated that the pillows were too firm so I thought they'd be perfect for me, but I lay my head on them and my head practically rested on the mattress underneath. So if you like firm pillows, this is probably not for you. On the bright side, stacking these on top of my old pillows has created quite a nice, plump pillow",

They are so affordable that every time a loved one complains about their pillows, I just order more and gift them proudly. New apartment housewarming? These pillows. Moving into a dorm room? These pillows. Aunt wakes up with a sore neck? These pillows. Guest bedroom? These pillows. Yeah, they're really that awesome!",

The first few weeks the pillow was as super \u201cpuffy\u201d which I loved without being too firm which is the problem I run into a lot. But over a few weeks the pillow has flattened in the center. The sides are still very puffy. Maybe I got a dud. It\u2019s still comfortable, just not \u201cthe one\u201d. So I\u2019ll still be looking for my perfect pillow.",
