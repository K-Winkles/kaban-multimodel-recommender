                "reviewText": "If you are looking for One Incredible Body pillow to blow your socks off, look no further..this is the one!! I can not say enough great things about this pillow. I've included pictures for your viewing pleasure..and hopefully my video in an update, as Amazon does not allow for video uploads from my phone. So let me start:1) Packaging for this product was substantial, secure, compact and clean. Which is important to me, so as it does not appear as though it was dragged through a warehouse.2) When opening this packaging, it was simple, easy and without issue. Just scissors and hands.3) Upon completion of opening this Snuggle-Pedic body pillow, it was compressed as expected and took a few minutes to somewhat \"plump\" up. As stated on the packaging and description on Amazon, you can put it into the dryer for 20 minutes and it will \"Fluff\" right up and help to remove any smell that might be lingering. It is substantially heavier in weight than my previous body pillow from Bed, Bath and Beyond, but no so much so that it my tender muscles, fibro issues and autoimmune massive pain can't handle. I don't mind it being more substantial, as the increased support, give and return and comfiness make up for that.4) As others have stated, it does have a slight smell, but to be fair, I have a nose like a blood hound and nothing gets past me in smell. With that being said both my Husband and myself had to put our noses directly on the pillow to smell the slight odor. To us, when we stuck our noses to it, it smelled like fresh paint. It was not overwhelming, or caused me to get a headache or migraine. As I have chronic migraines and most anything can set me off. This however, did not. I am as sensitive as they come to smells and changes, and did not notice the extreme odor that some others complain of.5) After completing the 20 minute cycle in the dryer, not only did the Snuggle-Pedic pillow FULLY \"plump\" up but when putting our noses back up to the pillow for inspection of odor, it was nearly completely gone. Let me repeat, I am sensitive to smells and we could not smell it without having to put our noses directly on the pillow.6) Without a cover on this Snuggle~Pedic Bamboo Pillow, it is super soft, appears clean and well made. It has the appropriate give and return that is as described and as I expected.7) Laying, leaning or sleeping with this Snuggle-Pedic Bamboo pillow is magnificent!! I have fibromyalgia and autoimmune disease both of which cause massive wide spread constant pain. With this pillow, in just one use, it gave me great support, stability, and comfort. Something I did not have with my previous body pillow as pictured here. I felt better when waking up, sitting up and slept better having used it. I like the support it gives your neck and back while sitting or laying on it. I think the support it gives you while laying down and literally \"Snuggling\" it is exceptional. Gives my hips relief from pain.8) It is completely washable which is something I look for in fabric products, as much as possible. (I am a germaphobe, our Son has asthma and we all have year round allergies). [Yes I know, not too clean as to kill the good germs, just like to keep things clean.]9) After my Husband/BFF put my plush body pillow cover on it (and it had been through the 20 minute dryer cycle) I could no longer smell any odor as once before. (As being as sensitive to odors as I am, I think some of the complaints on here are unsubstantiated and exaggerated, I can do get migraines (chronic migraines) from the slightest odor, but with this item, I did not. Some individuals are just never happy, satisfied and always want to complain about something). Find your daily sliver lining people!! What you think about, you bring about \ud83d\udc9a.10) It has a 20 year warranty!! Really, what more could you ask for?! That is more warranty than most mattresses come with these days.I hope that my review, pictures and video (coming soon) help anyone looking to purchase an incredible life long body pillow, just as I was.I am pleasantly pleased and would recommend and purchase this again for family and friends.Happy Sleeping and Relaxing!!",

                "reviewText": "I have been a body pillow user for years and decided to try something of higher quality. This pillow is higher quality. I find it to be very comfortable, and it does not lose its shape like my polyfiber-filled body pillows do. Upon unpacking the pillow, it remained fairly flat and compressed. After about 20 minutes, as per instructions, I put the pillow in the drier for 20 minutes on high heat. The pillow came out of the dryer fully expanded. Being full of shredded memory foam, it came out a little lumpy in one or two places where the foam had gathered. Simply making little adjustments by pressing here and there on the pillow set things aright.The pillow is quite heavy relative to other pillows. My previous fiber filled body pillow weighs 3.6 pounds. This Snuggle pillow, the same size as my fiber filled pillow, comes in at a whopping 7.8 pounds; over twice the weight of a \"normal\" body pillow. I recently bought two My Pillows for a queen sized guest bed. The two My Pillows laid end-to-end are the same size as the body pillows. Those two pillows together weigh only 3.2 pounds; virtual feathers compared to the Snuggle Pedic pillow. This is solely due to the higher quality of the denser foam used in the Snuggle Pedic pillow, which I consider to be a good thing. The Snuggle pillow feels like memory foam; the My Pillow feels like chunks of regular old foam material. The weight tells the story. I do not mind the heavier weight of the Snuggle pillow; I find that I can move it without a problem when changing body position in the night. Though, it may be a problem for some.This pillow is about 1.5\" inches longer than the stated 54\". It was a bit of a tighter fit for the pillow cases than were my fiber filled pillows. One might wish to consider buying a body pillow case with either a fold-over flap closure or a hidden zipper. This big pillow will likely stick out a bit from a regular 54\" open-ended case.This pillow suits my needs; I am in no way disappointed with it. If you like a big, fluffy, comfortable pillow and you can handle the weight, you should be pleased with the Snuggle-Pedic. Highly recommended .",
