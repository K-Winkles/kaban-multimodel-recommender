A1: Anvo contour memory foam pillow can only be helpful for improving sleeping quality, can't be used for diagnosis (e.g. cervical spondylosis.) Q2. What should I do if the memory foam neck pillow is too hard or too soft for me? A2. No gap between pillow and your shoulders. It has two heights, the higher side is firmer than the lower side. You can use higher side and put towels or clothes under pillow if pillow is too soft, or use lower side if too firm for you. Q3. What should I do if I feel uncomfortable when using this neck pillow for pain relief sleeping at the first time? A3. It's a normal situation that you may experience some discomfort during the first two weeks while your body is trying to adjust to the correct position. Our pillows are ergonomically designed to protect your spine for a long-term use. Q4. The pillow is rolled up in a sealed vacuum bag, will affect the support of pillow? A4. As it's made of high density slow rebound memory foam. It will go back to its original shape right away when the package is opened. And it is more convenient for you to carry our neck pain pillow when you travel. Q5. Does the pillow have any weired smell? The memory foam itself will have a very slight smell, which is normal. Please wash the pillowcase before use and leave the core in well-ventilated area for 1-3 days. The smell will gone.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this pillow just a couple of days now but my neck and shoulder pain is already gone and I sleep so much better at night. Less tossing and turning and no more waking up with pain in my shoulder and neck. I gave up the infamous \"MyPillows\" after experiencing months of pain when waking up. I had both a firm and soft MyPillow and both would \"deflate\" at the neck and I would wake up with my neck crunched up and my opposite shoulder nearly touching my ear. With this new pillow that hasn't happened! I've been using the \"firm\" side but it's so nice and cradling it doesn't feel \"firm.\" I can't put into words how pleasant this pillow is to use. I normally sleep on my side with my arm above my head (as if I am raising my hand in class) and I am still able to sleep that way but it is also just as comfortable to extend my arm out in front of me along the lower edge of the pillow. I tend to roll forward towards my stomach because I kick my knee out in front of me and either arm position is completely comfortable. I'm in love. I can't believe I waited so long to buy this. **Note: this is my first pillow shaped like this so I have no additional points of reference.",

However\u2026hubby slept on it and it\u2019s not squishy when his head is on it. He loves the two sides of high or low depending on how his neck feels. Also it\u2019s a hwavy weighted pillow. If you\u2019re looking to CURE your neck pain\u2026I\u2019ve no idea if this is for you. But\u2026hubby said it does support his neck and he sleeps well. Would buy again!",

Most forget they are pillows after about 6 months and I start dreaming of a new one. The original one I ordered was a firm pillow with some weight to it and it supported my neck very well. This one does not seem like it is going to last and is not what I expected.",

These pillows are incredibly comfortable, providing excellent support for my head, neck, and spine while I sleep. The material used to make these pillows is soft and breathable, keeping me cool throughout the night, and I don't wake up with any soreness or stiffness.What I appreciate about these pillows is that they retain their shape, even after extended use. The pillows do not flatten out, and they continue to provide the same level of support as when I first purchased them. This feature has made them a long-term investment for my sleep health.Another feature that makes these pillows stand out is their size. The standard size fits perfectly on my bed, and they complement my sleeping position. Additionally, I believe that these pillows offer excellent value for money, and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again or recommend them to others.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase of these pillows. They have exceeded my expectations, providing a comfortable and supportive sleeping experience. If you are in the market for a new pillow, I highly recommend giving these a try.",
