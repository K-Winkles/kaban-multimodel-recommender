I will definitely keep them, but I'm not sure I would buy again. Time will tell how they age. Fit was good and so was the price!",

                "reviewText": "LOVED the fitted sheet that actually fits my 18\" mattress AND the separate, soft (foam) 2\" mattress topper....then it STAYED IN PLACE while I slept! All the stitching has been well sewn & sturdy around the elastic edge, KUDOS! I did purchase a queen-sized set for my full-sized mattress just to be on the safe side (in case of shrinkage after washing). I didn't try the sheets on the bed before washing, so I'm not sure whether or not they did or didn't shrink after coming out of the dryer. However, after washing, I LOVE the way these sheets fit! There isn't much excess material at all across the top of the fitted sheet, so I'm extremely happy with my purchase of sheets that are one size larger. Removing these sheets from the dryer immediately went a long way toward avoiding an excess of wrinkles. My only disappointment is that I wish this cotton was thicker/heavier - these sheets are very light-weight and thin, so I'll just have to wait & see how long-lasting they are.UPDATE 1 MONTH LATER: After several weeks, I'm still EXTREMELY pleased with my purchase. These sheets launder beautifully - the fabric is soft but appears to be sturdy and there are NO signs of unraveling of thread around the elastic fitted bottom sheet. I look forward to doing business with this company again in the future and have no reservations in recommending them to others.",
