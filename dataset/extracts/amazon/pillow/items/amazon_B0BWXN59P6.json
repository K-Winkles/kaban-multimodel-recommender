I thought\u2026.\u201dWho are these for? Andre the gaint?\u201dThey might be great as bolster support pillows for sitting up in bed but you certainly couldn\u2019t put your head on them so sleep as is. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t even get a king pillow case on them they were so thick. I bought them as body/leg support pillows but couldn\u2019t even wrap my leg across they were so thick!THEN I read the reviews. They\u2019re customizable! Just take out as much filling as you need to make it the thickness you desire. The filling is nice and pliable.Once customized to my desired thickness they were great! Photos are AFTER I took out at hat bag full of filling.I took over half the filling out to get them where I needed them. I\u2019m going to use use the trash bag fill of filling to restuff some older throw follows gone flat.For the price they\u2019re great. I can\u2019t vouch for \u201ccooling\u201d effect as I don\u2019t have problems with that. But overall I love that they\u2019re customizable, soft, and supportive.",

I know you can take some of the stuffing out , but I am afraid it might get lumpy and uncomfortable then. If you are a stomach sleeper you will definitely need to remove some of the filling. They are well made, definitely work it if you like a firmer, thick pillow.",
