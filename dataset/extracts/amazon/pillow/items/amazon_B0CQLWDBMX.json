                "reviewText": "I doubted how comfortable a strangely shaped pillow could be, but sleeping on it showed me it did the job. I'm used to sleeping on stacked pillows to support my neck and as a side-sleeper most of these memory foam pillows don't work for me. This pillow is solid enough for one pillow to be enough, and the shape makes it easy to wrap your arms around it. I recently had shoulder surgery, so waking up in pain is common - but not with this one.Most memory foam pillows I've tried take a while to uncurl after arriving in compressed form and reek of chemicals until they have time to air out. No such trouble here. The pillow popped out to the proper size in the few minutes and I had no trouble with the smell on the first night. It fits nicely inside a standard king pillowcase, giving me more comfort than the outer fabric. Don't let the strange shape fool you. This is a great pillow. It is comfortable, and cool, and does a great job supporting your neck and shoulders. Highly recommended.",
