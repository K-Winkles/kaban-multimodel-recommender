                "reviewText": "For some unknown reason, I have trouble finding good pillows to sleep on. I've had lots of expensive pillows that worked fine for a couple of months and then started giving me neck pain in the mornings. So I ordered this set of memory foam pillows which are also cooling pillows. These come with stuffing so you can decide whether you want to leave yours as it is on arrival or remove or add more stuffing.These are very well made pillows with a bamboo cover that you can remove for washing. The zipper works well and doesn't get in my way, and since I sleep on my side I used all the stuffing in my pillows. These are soft and comfortable but not flat, except they're vacuum sealed when they arrive. It takes a couple of days for these to fluff up nicely.One side of each pillow is a cooling pillow, and the other side is a breathable bamboo rayon. Both sides are comfortable for me, but I prefer the cooling side. These pillows are also very good for reading in bed.I use a silk pillowcase on my pillow because I've had some damage to my hair, and that's good for repairing and not knotting your hair. I still get the cooling features very well, just as if I didn't have a pillowcase on it.These are excellent pillows, stuffed with memory foam that you can remove or add since the pillows come with a bag of extra stuffing. The company provides information about how to stuff these for back sleepers, stomach sleepers, and side sleepers. They have a bamboo pillow cover which is easy to zip and unzip so you can wash them. I didn't put my pillow covers in the dryer. Finally, I have a comfortable, cooling pillow - actually two of them - that's remained comfortable ever since I received it.I highly recommend this set of pillows, which also come in queen and king sizes. They're very well made, comfortable, and have several different features. I sleep on my side, so I put all the stuffing in the pillows as instructed. These are sold at a great price point and should last a good long time with proper care.",
