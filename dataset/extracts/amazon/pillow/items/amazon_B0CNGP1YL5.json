It's always hard to get comfortable and feels like I don't ever get a nice night of sleep. I've been using this pillow for 3 nights now and it really has helped so much. I feel like my neck isn't laying at an angle anymore and like it's aligned so much better so I don't wake up with it being sore too. Typically I toss and turn a lot but I haven't been since using the pillow. It's very comfortable to lay on and very breathable.When opening, it was very flat but once air hit it, it started fluffing right up. I would recommend waiting close to 24 hours before actually sleeping on it, so that it does have the time needed to fully shape!",

It\u2019s shrink wrapped so like most items you need to give it at least a fluff. You can use a standard pillow case on it. Good for all positions of sleep, front, back and side.",
