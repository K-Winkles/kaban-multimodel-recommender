                "reviewText": "Mike Driscoll does an excellent job covering Python Imaging Library (PIL). I really enjoy his style and method f teaching. The font, and format of this book is easy on the eyes. Each snippet of code is concise, numbered, and very well explained. My favorite chapter was Chapter 3, which covered getting image metadata which I thought was very cool! The majority of the photos example are in color, and are quite beautiful. I also appreciated that all project examples were available on GitHub. I give this book a 5/5 stars, and highly recommend it if you want to learn PIL.",

                "reviewText": "Does a great job covering the common features of the Pillow library! The features covered are well selected and the example images for each operation are high resolution, so even the more subtle features are demonstrated quite well.All Pillow features that are covered include easy to read code samples, so it's great reference material for my projects. The real killer feature for me is the use of PySimpleGUI to build small GUI applications to demo the various Pillow features. The section covering various Python GUI libraries at the end is also great for extending the examples in the book.",
