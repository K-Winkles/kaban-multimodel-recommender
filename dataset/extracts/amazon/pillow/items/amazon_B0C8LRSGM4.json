                "reviewText": "Decided to try this pillow out since I am predominantly a side sleeper. At first I was skeptical of the shape and weight of this pillow. It is a lot lighter than I expected and I was skeptical that it would be able to support my head when laying on it. Thankfully, that isn't the case and it has a surprisingly comforting feel when laying on it. The \"icebox\" feature is noticeable when first laying on it but I didn't feel that the pillow stayed very cool much longer after laying on it. If you're the type of person that falls asleep quickly, you'll probably love the \"icebox\" feature.Now I've had this pillow for about a month now and if you are a 100% side sleeper, I would definitely recommend this pillow. This pillow will support your head and neck while sleeping on your side with no issues. I have had many great nights sleep using this pillow. The only issue is that if you turn onto your back while you sleep (which I've done once or twice), you will likely wake up with neck pain/cramps as this pillow is not designed in any way shape or form for anything but side sleeping. If you're considering this pillow, I would recommend it for $20. There are more expensive pillows out there that don't perform as well as this one.",

                "reviewText": "Pillows are so personal. I ordered this hoping it would solve everything. First off, I tried to hurry the process by putting it in the dryer on low for an hour instead of letting it air out for a couple days. I slept on it part of the first night but it hadn't aired enough so I switched it out in the wee hours. After airing a couple days I tried it again but I could not get comfortable with it. I'm largely a side-sleeper but also a rotisserie-chicken-sleeper. It felt too high for me, any way I slept. Regarding the cooling effect: I could feel the difference with the cooler side but it was not as cool as I would wish. (Nothing is.) Next my hub tried it out and he likes it. He said he thought it would be too high but it wasn't. He's a side-and-back sleeper. So on his side of the bed it has a home.",

                "reviewText": "Okay so admittedly I've seen many ads for other cube/rectangular shaped pillows that are out there in the market. They intrigued me - I'm an all-over sleeper but typically end up side sleeping most of the time. This Bluewave Bedding cube pillow works wonderfully for side sleeping.It's kinda tough to get used to at first if you are used to more cushy or fluffy types of pillows, but now that I've been using it more than a few weeks - this is THE pillow - the pillow I sleep on nightly. I'm impressed. I feel like it may have alleviated some of the neck tension I get from being such a chaotic sleeper at night. I noticed less jaw muscle tension as well.Attached is a picture of the pillow next to the box it came in. It was compressed in packaging and took some time to inflate to size. I put mine in a nice satin pillow case [not pictured].I recommend this type of pillow to side sleepers looking to help posture correct themselves and alleviate some of the pain and annoyances that come with side sleeping on traditional pillows.",

                "reviewText": "I've never had a rectangular pillow like this; I'm used to jamming and fluffing or stacking my pillows to get the height and shoulder space I want for sleeping on my side, so for me this was a game changer! The memory foam is comfy, the shape is perfect for the way I usually fall sleep, and the height of the pillow is exactly what I needed! I even like the flat top, it's comfortable and doesn't seem to jam my glasses into the side of my nose as much as other pillows do (I know I shouldn't sleep in them, but before I fall asleep or the times I forget to take them off).I shift around and reposition a lot before I eventually fall asleep, and the absolute only downside to this pillow so far are the times I happen to end up falling asleep on my back and my head/neck winds up at an awkward angle - but that's a me issue, not a problem with the pillow itself. Even so, the memory foam will squish down enough it's not too uncomfy in the morning. As it's designed to function, this pillow works great, and I'm so so happy I ordered this.Bonus use as a makeshift lap desk for my laptop in bed, the flat top is great for keeping things level and as a flat mouse surface. It's not what it was intended for, but hey, just another reason to love it!",

                "reviewText": "This unique square shape is great for side sleeping. Your shoulder fits right up against it where you full head and neck are supported. Regular pillows fight your shoulder area trying to compress it so your head can get support, not with Bluewave Bedding Icebox Cube Pillow. I can't brag on the \"icebox\" feature too much. When you first lay down it feels cool but that doesn't last long. Still that is not a problem, it is still more comfortable than other pillows for side sleeping. I would call the foam a medium to medium high density. It is very supportive while still feeling comfortable soft. The memory foam will give in nicely but not too much. The picture above where I have pressed down on the pillow took a lot of force to push it down that far. IF you end up laying on your back the pillow will not compress to a comfortable height, it is strictly for side sleeping. For a high quality material and constructed pillow this is a great price.",
