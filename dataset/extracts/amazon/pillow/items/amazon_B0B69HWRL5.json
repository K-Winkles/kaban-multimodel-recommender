This is not a soft material it's a little harder and thicker but that's what I needed for this couch as it gets lots of use. I liked these pillow cases so much I just ordered two more.",

If you don\u2019t actively use your throw pillows (I know a lot of people don\u2019t), then the fact they\u2019re not SOFT probably won\u2019t matter to you. I don\u2019t typically use my throw pillows as actual pillows for naps or whatever. So, it\u2019s not a huge deal to me either, but I wasn\u2019t expecting them to LOOK as scratchy as they feel. That\u2019s only minor though, and one of my personal quirks with things like this. Overall they are exactly as you see pictured. If you\u2019re looking for a versatile style that will match almost any decor or if you haven\u2019t even decided on decor yet. You can go with this set confidently.",

They are versatile and although I originally thought I would use in the living room, I ended up using them in the master bedroom. They are neutral enough despite the light stripes to work in multiple places in the home. I had bought multiple covers for staging a home and returned most. These were the right price and the quality is topnotch. If I had a criticism it would be that they would look better with down pillow forms than what I used as they seem slightly big for the size pillow that they fit.",
