                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve dealt with neck pain for years and have tried lots of pillows. The Casper Original Pillow is the one that finally helps me get a good night\u2019s sleep and awaken without neck pain. I agree with other reviewers who\u2019ve said it\u2019s like sleeping on a cloud while providing the right amount of firmness and support that holds the head in alignment with the spine without putting pressure on the shoulder. I\u2019m a side and back sleeper and it\u2019s great for both positions. The fabric is a little crunchy, but that\u2019s a very small minus compared to all the pluses.",

The surface is cool. It almost feels like a gel. I felt comfortable when I laid down to sleep, fell asleep quickly, and slept well through the night! My neck was still comfortable in the morning.I usually sleep on my side.Now we have a Casper mattress, dog bed, and pillows! I recommend!Update: After one week I'm still very happy with my pillow. My fiance seems fairly happy and has taken out the inner pillow to make two pillows which she sleeps on stacked. She says that's working better for her. She did not like either of her previous pillows.",

                "reviewText": "I have to praise the Casper Sleep Original Pillow for its unique design and the way it contours to the shape of the head and neck. The pillow is made from a combination of memory foam and down-alternative fibers, which provides both support and comfort. The outer cover is made from a breathable and soft cotton material, which helps keep the pillow cool and comfortable.One of the standout features of the Casper Sleep Original Pillow is its unique \"pillow-in-pillow\" design. The pillow consists of an inner pillow that provides support, surrounded by an outer pillow that adds softness and comfort. This makes it a great option for people who want a balance of support and comfort in their pillow.However, my boyfriend mentioned that the pillow may be too firm or thick for his liking, and that it may take some time to get used to the unique shape and feel of the pillow.Overall, the Casper Sleep Original Pillow seems like a high-quality and comfortable option for people who want a supportive and comfortable pillow that can provide a balance of support and comfort. While it may not be the right fit for everyone, many customers have reported improved sleep and reduced pain after using the pillow.",
