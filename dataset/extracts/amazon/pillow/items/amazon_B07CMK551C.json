                "reviewText": "So this review is for those who have previously owned the Symphony, given all the current debate in the reviews.This pillow is NOT like the previous Symphony. I have owned the symphony all the way back to my first in 2009.HOWEVER...it's not all bad. I still like this new version.I definitely like the price of this Amazon order compared to the $99 tempur-pedic store tag (which are currently out of stock and have to be shipped anyways). Even on a BOGO at the tempur-pedic store. The \u201cVery Good Used\" I bought beats that price and was in pristine condition when it arrived.The shape is still the iconic Symphony look. The shape is what I have always loved, it's perfect for back and side sleeping. The loft seems ever so slightly lower, but still adequate. If the lower loft bothers you I suggest supplementing the height with a Bamboo Miracle pillow underneath (with most of the shredded foam removed). This works for watching TV in bed or needing the occasional extra height.The foam weight and density are the primary differences. This symphony is noticeably lighter. It just doesn't have that heft the earlier ones did.The nature of this new foam feels different against the head. If you're trying to compare in stores and don't have access to a Symphony, the softness and density of this molded foam compares to the cloud. The old Symphony in my opinion is more like the current Pro Adapt models.All this being said, so far (a week in) I like this new model better. I easily develop neck and sciatic pain with the wrong pillow support. I have always favored soft to the touch pillows but end up missing the support the lack.I loved my original Symphonys. They are the only pillows in my purchases that have made it to the 5 year mark on their warranty. But after the symphony redesign, all the negative reviews caused me to seek other pillows. I tried so many; the Kohl's Big One side sleeper, The Lucid hybrid, Serta, the Sleep Angel, The Miracle Bamboo Pillow etc...etc...They always last about a year (if I'm lucky) and I move on to a new one. I finally got sick of the failure and figured the higher price tag and mixed reviews of tempur-pedic was worth going back to.Bottom-Line - This pillow has a soft feel but it still supports my head and neck. It has the iconic tempur sink and collapse but with a spring'ier response back after lifting up. It doesn't have as firm or dense a feel against the head, so if that was your thing on the previous model...this might not be for you. It really does have a \u201ccloud\u201d effect. It holds you there, but you don't notice a push back. I personally like the new feel..but I was the type that secretly wished the original felt softer.I have noticed using this pillow I am out cold for the night. Others I toss and turn and adjust and never really hit that deep sleep. That makes it a great buy for myself! I will be curious to see how the cloud foam holds up over time. My worry is if it starts soft...and most foam softens over time, I may lose that needed support. Time will tell.*UPDATE - item started causing a lot of neck and shoulder pain. It was returned. On to try the Serta Perfect Curve and the Ikea KLUBBSPORRE",

I can only breath through one nostril at different times through the night and because of the shape of the pillow it doe not matter what side I sleep on because i can breathe through either.
