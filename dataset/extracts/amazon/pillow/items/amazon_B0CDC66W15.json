                "reviewText": "I've tried four different brands of shredded memory foam pillows from Amazon, and they are not all the same as I once believed. This one by RGTIME is the clear winner.Why it wins:- Real memory foam with decent rebound time, doesn't simply spring back right away- Consistently sized pieces, no large lumps- Soft enough for back and stomach sleep without removing a bunch of filling, comfortable to lean againstOther brands I've tried and why they aren't as good:- Homby's pillows were too firm for me with unevenly cut foam. I could feel the large chunks through the pillow and it was also stuffed with \"fines\", small useless pieces of foam. If you want a super firm pillow for side-sleeping, this would be a good option if you're willing to cut the larger chunks down and remove the fines.- Enerplex is decent and I slept on one of their pillows for 18 months, but it has a faster rebound time and more polyfill than the RGTIME. If you prefer a more \"bouncy\" soft pillow, consider this one.- Nctoberows uses horrible quality \"junk\" foam that had absolutely no memory. No one should ever purchase one of these.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the COOP Home Goods Cool pillows a couple weeks ago. Paid $318 plus tax for two king size pillows. For the money I wanted to be impressed. I was not. Nothing special. To be fair, I might have liked them better had I added the provided extra foam, but I knew that there was not going to be anything magical about the pillows. There are lots of comparable pillows for much less on Amazon and other places. So I sent them back and after much searching and reading I settled on these pillows which cost 1/6th of the COOP.I received these pillows a few hrs ago. Initial observations are that these are very similar to the COOP, but I noticed that these pillows expanded within 30 min. It took the COOP pillows about 24 hrs. Don\u2019t know if that is good or bad. Perhaps they will eventually break down quicker than the COOP, maybe not.Honestly , these pillows feel better (comfy, firm but soft) than the COOP ones. They do; however, have a strong odor so far. I\u2019m sure this will go away eventually. It always does.I tried one of the pillows out briefly and it felt great. I\u2019m hopeful. It did not lose its shape like the COOP did, and I have not added the extra foam to these pillows. Don\u2019t think I will need it, as the loft is as high as I would like it to be. I\u2019m looking forward to my neck issues being resolved as these pillows seem to allow proper alignment of my head, neck and spine.",

It smells absolutely atrocious, though. I'll be patient as I know it will fade, but it's straight nasty smelling out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "What an adventure it\u2019s been to find the perfect pillow. I tried at least a dozen and sent them all back. Here\u2019s what I, a side sleeper who has one pillow under my noggin, another between my knees and another I hold with my \u201cup\u201d arm for ballast, learned in the process:1. Everyone has different needs for their pillow and what might work well for one isn\u2019t great for another; this is the reason reviews of the same pillow can vary widely. I usually rely heavily on reviews, but pillow reviews were confusing and a bit misleading. And a review of \u201cGreat Pillow\u201d doesn\u2019t really help.2. Memory foam is great, but pillows with one big chunk of memory foam seem like sofa cushions and don\u2019t adjust as much as the manufacturers suggest. All that I tried were too thick.3. The memory foam in this pillow is thousands of good quality little pieces of foam and, most importantly, pieces can be added or removed until the best thickness and feel is achieved. I removed some pieces for my best fit.4. Adjustability of the amount of foam turned out to be the single most important feature for me.5. No need to spend over $100 for designer pillows!",
