                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this celestial satin pillowcase and have been thoroughly impressed with its quality and benefits. The first thing that caught my eye was the striking design, featuring a beautiful celestial pattern that adds a touch of elegance and charm to my bedroom decor.After washing it, I noticed that the pillowcase retained its softness, which is a testament to its high-quality material. This softness is not just a luxury to the touch, but it also plays a practical role, especially for someone like me with curly hair. The smooth satin surface has significantly reduced hair frizz and tangling, making my morning hair routine much more manageable.Furthermore, this pillowcase has been a blessing for my skin. Unlike other materials that can absorb moisture and oils from the skin, the satin fabric of this pillowcase helps in maintaining hydration, leaving my skin feeling fresh and less prone to breakouts and dryness.Overall, I would rate the celestial satin pillowcase a solid 10/10. It\u2019s not just a visually appealing bedroom accessory, but it also offers tangible benefits for hair and skin health, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking comfort and style in their sleeping environment.",

                "reviewText": "These pillowcases are extremely smooth and soft to the touch. It is a MAJOR upgrade from the common pillowcases that everyone has. Now, if you're interested in these silk pillowcases because of the theory that they will help clear your skin from acne, I was too. Unfortunately, I don't think that these pillowcases directly affected my acne in any way, but then again it is different for every person so maybe give it a shot! Worst-case scenario, you'll end up with the comfiest pillow case you've ever had. I did however notice that my night skincare didn't get absorbed into the pillowcases as it would've been with cotton ones. This is one of the main reasons why I love these pillowcases, they let your skincare stay on your face! These pillowcases are durable unless you are purposefully stretching them to their limits, and the colors are beautiful, especially the blue that I got!!! I will definitely be buying more pairs so that I don't have to use *cough* cotton *cough* pillowcases while my silk ones are washing. For its price, it's a wonderful thing to buy and I 100% recommend these!!!",

                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised when I received these pillowcases as they were/are everything that they should be! They are extremely, extremely soft and silky. They don\u2019t have any blemishes, snags, tears, or the dreaded \u201cpermanent imprints\u201d that this type of fabric is so prone to getting and that seems to happen so easily and readily. The stitching along the seams is straight, durable/thick/secure. The pillowcases also don\u2019t get as wrinkled, if really honestly wrinkled at all, also like silk fabrics can get (I know that a portion of the other reviewers stated that theirs had issues with wrinkling, this was definitely not the case with me.), and that\u2019s the case for me with no special precautions or measure that I did to prevent them from wrinkling: just a normal wash cycle with laundry detergent and fabric softener, and then throw into the dryer on the bedding setting (with the rest of my dark colored bedding), so on a high dryer heat setting. The color (navy blue) of the pillowcases is as expected: deep, rich, and even throughout. Nor is there any bleeding of the color of the pillowcases onto my bedding or onto my pajamas, even when I\u2019ve had the occasional hot night, with mild night sweats. While the silk fabric is not cooling at all, it also isn\u2019t as hot as some silk, and silk bedding products can be. The overall size of the pillowcases in relation to the standard or usual pillow sizes (Standard/Queen Sized, or King Sized) is that they are slightly larger than they should be (which is the only slight negative that I can find with this product), but hey, at least there won\u2019t be any issues with my pillows hanging out of the pillowcases, my pillows constantly \u201cpeaking out\u201d of the pillowcase, or me having to royally shove my pillow into the case each time I change my bedding or make my bed because they barely fit into the pillowcase.Definitely worth the money! An amazing deal abs value and just an overall great buy! I\u2019ll probably buy another set for my bed just for when I\u2019m washing my bedding, so I\u2019ll have another set that I can use, rotating them out.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using the EXQ Home Satin Pillowcases for a few weeks now, and they\u2019ve significantly improved my sleep quality. The satin material is not only luxurious to the touch but also beneficial for my hair and skin. I\u2019ve noticed less hair breakage and fewer skin irritations since making the switch.The silver grey color is elegant and has held up well in the wash, maintaining its sheen and color. The envelope closure is a thoughtful design, eliminating the discomfort of zippers.These pillowcases are surprisingly cooling, providing comfort during warmer nights. They\u2019re a great combination of style, comfort, and functionality. Highly recommended for anyone looking to add a touch of luxury to their bedding.",

I find they keep their cool and so soft and silky feeling. Even though your a hot mess, knowing your head is resting on this silky soft material somehow makes it all better. And if your feeling it\u2019s getting warm just flip the pillow and the other side is so nice and cool. Just lovely! And if you doManage not to break out into a hot flash during the night it actually helps your hair not looking so rooster like in the morning. Washed well and best part it does not show sweat marks or droolStains as bad as other pillow cases! Bonus!",
