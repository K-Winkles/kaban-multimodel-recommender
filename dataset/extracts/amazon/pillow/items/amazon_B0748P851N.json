This protector fit both (though it\u2019s roomier on mine) and will keep our expensive pillows clean when used with a regular pillow case. I also like that it masks the light blue swirly lines on the pillows themselves which showed through our white pillow cases. We have the Cloud Pro + Cooling pillows which are only sold in Tempur stores. Also, there is no discernible difference in comfort, conforming, or heat when adding this protector.
