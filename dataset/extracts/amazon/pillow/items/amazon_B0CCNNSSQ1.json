                "reviewText": "I like this product from Bespillow. I like the firmness. The pillow feels softer than the pillows I tried from the same company. The pillow maintains its shape well, and doesn\u2019t flatten out over time. There are two sides to sleep on the pillow. One side is higher than the other to sleep on. I prefer the lower side. So, having this option is great. It\u2019s odorless memory foam, and does not have bad new pillow odor. The cover is soft and breathable, keeping me cool throughout the night. It is also washable, which is a plus.I am a side and stomach sleeper, but I have no problem sleeping either way with this pillow. I\u2019ve been waking up with no neck pain or shoulder pain. The sleep has been more deeper and restful.In summary, the pillow has exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, support, and overall sleep quality. Its high-quality memory foam, breathable cover, and thoughtful design make it a top choice for anyone seeking a restful night's sleep. I highly recommend the pillow to those looking for a durable and supportive pillow that can transform their sleep experience.",

                "reviewText": "I used it for the first time a couple of nights ago. I normally wouldn't write a review so quickly after trying a product like this because it's important to use it for a while to really get a feeling for it. However, I've used contour pillows for over 30 years, so I think I know exactly what I'm looking for, what to expect, and what I like and don't like.I love this pillow. It\u2019s more firm than my previous one, so it gives better support for when I\u2019m lying on my back, which reduces snoring and air flow interruption. My wife said she sleeps better now as well because of that (because I don't keep waking her up!). It\u2019s also longer than my previous 3 contour pillows, and I really like the bigger size. It means I don\u2019t have to adjust the pillow during the night. On other shorter pillows, sometimes I would get to the edge as I roll around, and I would wake up because I was off the pillow. That hasn't happened with this one (due to the additional length).I'm about 5'9 and use the higher contoured side. I think if I were a smaller person I'd probably want to flip it around to use the other side of the contour, but the higher side works perfectly for me. As I said, the pillow is on the firmer side, so it gives a lot of support, but it's soft enough that I can lie on my side as well. I like to sleep in all positions, so this is important to me.I can't say how long it will last (because I've only just started using it), but it feels just as high quality as any of my previous pillows, so I would expect it to last as long. I generally use my pillows for 4-5 years before replacing them, and don't doubt this will hold up.Of note, it's lighter than my previous pillow, which I like. I do like to flip the pillow around sometimes (if I sleep on my stomach), so the lighter weight makes that easier. I realize now that my previous one was too heavy.For the price I paid (which was a lot cheaper than my previous pillow), I consider this a steal.",

                "reviewText": "This pillow is one of the coldest feeling pillows I've ever used by far lol. So that part is great. It is also very high quality and doesn't feel cheap at all. Only reason I took off 1 star is because it is too firm in my opinion. I mean you really have to push your head into it pretty dang hard for it to give in at all.I'll probably end up using this pillow in my recliner somehow rather than sleeping on it. I really think it will be great for my back, under my legs, or even to sit on as a seat cushion. It is def too good a pillow not to use. Just too firm to sleep comfortably on.Maybe after I use it a while in my recliner it will soften up some and I'll try sleeping on it again in a couple months.",

I decided to try a cervical pillow which I'd avoided thinking it didn't look comfortable. I reviewed a lot of them. This one was the least expensive but looked just like the others. I ordered it and I love it.The pillow is soft and cool to the touch. It gently cradles my neck yet offers support. It works well whether sleeping on my back or side. I'm now waking without a headache and stiffness. It's a great pillow.",
