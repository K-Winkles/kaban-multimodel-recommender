                "reviewText": "I thought I'd first point out that one of my zippered pillow coverings was badly torn. This didn't happen during shipping as it was damaged before it was vacuum-sealed. I tried to get in contact to hopefully get a replacement, but since Amazon themselves fulfilled the order, my only recourse was to return both pillows (now fully fluffed up) to get a refund. I don't want to return the pillows, I just want a replacement for the cover. I guess I'll be pulling out the old sewing kit.As for the pillows themselves... not bad. Not the softest things I've ever put my head on, but pretty comfortable. I had to remove a significant amount of foam to get it to the right level for me. That leaves a bunch of extra memory foam that I can use for cushions, or lumbar support, or wrist rests. I can't speak to how \"cooling\" these pillows are since it's freezing cold where I live right now, but I haven't gotten overly hot.",

They come shrink wrapped and are flat when taken out of the box, but once out of the plastic, they magically puff up in a few minutes. Unlike other reviewers, I did not have to remove extra filling. I like the firmness and the height of these pillows. One reviewer said there was a funny smell, but for me there was no smell.",
