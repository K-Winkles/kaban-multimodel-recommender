About 4 nights in with these and no pain whatsoever. Very comfortable. Just the right firmness without removing/adding the filling.Price is fantastic too. The one side is pretty cooling as well, but I honestly don't care that much about the cool aspect of pillows. Definitely recommend. I hope this company keeps making these.",

The first couple nights my neck was sore. But now that the smell is gone and the pillow has contoured to my head, it's probably the best pillow I've ever had.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these 3 king pillows to refill the back cushions on the mid century sofa we bought at Salvation Army 12 years ago. We used that sofa in our Living Room until our house sold in Kentucky & after our furniture came, we move this sofa to the basement where our grandkids used it for years. Recently we had half of the basement renovated into an apartment & moved that still loved sofa into the Living Room of the apartment. The main reason these make such perfect replacement stuffing for the cushions is that they have zippers & extra stuffing & you can control the firmness. And for just $21 per cushion it was easy & inexpensive.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried numerous pillows in recent years and never found one that was truly comfortable and would last. Granted, this is the most I have spent for a pillow on a gamble. I am nearly a week into this one and it is well worth the money! It is both soft and supportive all night. It does have to be fluffed now and then, but it is a very easy fluff to simply reposition the insides. No more beating my pillow into submission! I found the pillow to be perfect without adding or removing any stuffing.",

I just recently had neck surgery and needed something top-notch to be comfortable sitting up and lying down while I heal. I'm so satisfied with this pillow it will be the only one I ever buy as long as they keep making it!5 stars from me - please try before you buy others!",
