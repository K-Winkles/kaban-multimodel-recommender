I can breathe so much better sleeping on this pillow than any other I've ever bought! To the point my family can't hear me snoring. It's very supportive yet soft and fluffy! I have even bought pillows in this price point that don't compare in the least! It's well worth the price for sure!!It does fit a standard pillow case by the way.",

I'm 5'2 with broad shoulders and am a religious side sleeper who'd been struggling with shoulder pain while sleeping. It's helped my shoulder pain, but I do wish it was a little firmer to help my neck a little more. My husband is 6 ft - also a side sleeper- and it's almost too soft and short for him. We fold a blanket up under each of ours to boost them up a bit more and that helps. If it was another inch or two taller and firmer, it'd be perfect. Still better than most pillows- even the cervical pillows we've used for the last 3 years- but be warned it may not be enough of a fix for broad shouldered side sleepers.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for a pillow that is firm, cooling and provides the right amount of support for side sleeping. I thought a cube shaped pillow would be a gimmick but after watching their video, i decided to give it a try because it looked like it actually could do what they say it does. I ordered my pillow and it came flattened and vacuum sealed. After removing it from the vacuum seal, it plumped immediately. It did have a slight chemically smell but that dissipated quickly. After two nights sleeping with the pillow I realized I had ordered the wrong size for my height. I ordered regular size for individuals over 5\u2019 3\u201d. I am 5\u20191\u201d and I found that the pillow was too thick so I wasn\u2019t getting the proper alignment. So when you order, be sure to make sure you order the correct size pillow for the height/size. I sized down to the thin, which turned out to be perfect. Upon opening the pillow, I did feel like the thin wasn\u2019t has firm as the standard but it turned out to be fine. The pillow looks like a cute rectangular block. The pillow casing is very soft and cool to the touch. I will say that the pillow does stay cool for a very long time. When I\u2019m ready to sleep, I tuck the pillow between my shoulder against my neck. Once I lay my head down on the cool pillow, I fall asleep pretty fast. The pillow is comfortable and most importantly, the firmness is giving me the proper support to keep my spine aligned. So far I\u2019ve been sleeping on this pillow for about a month and I really love it. Most pillows lose their firmness and therefore lose the head and neck support. I have high hopes that this pillow will remain firm for a long time. I\u2019ll try to remember to do an update after 6 months of using this pillow. For now, it\u2019s definitely a recommend from me!",

                "reviewText": "The box pillow came in a 'small' box. It is a foam cube inside of a pillow case with zipper. After un wrappiig the plastic around the rolled up deflated pillow it will take on air and expand to the pillows intended size. What I noticed right afer this enlargement was a smell kind of like a hobby glue or maybe turpentine (we all smell things differently) that permeated the pillow cover which was around the foam. Took off the pillow case and discovered that the smell was coming from the foam inside. What to do. Return means findiing a larger box.So went to the product makers website through Amazon and this is some of the Chat, like chat because it gives a text to refer to at a later time. The answer shown here, surrounded by \"\"\", was right away so this situation must exist with other purchasers:\"\"\" System (Pillow Cube)Nov 3, 2023, 12:36 PM MDT(12:34:19 PM) *** John joined the chat ***(12:34:20 PM) John: Just opened up a pillow cube ordered through Amazon. Why does it smell. Washing out cover but the smell comes from the foam insert. Not wanting to sleep with the pillow if it continues to smell like a hobby glue.(12:34:45 PM) Aly: Hey John,All of the foam we use is of the highest quality. We've seen that if the pillow is packaged quickly after the foam is made, it will have a stronger smell.Luckily, the smell WILL go away. The easiest way to speed up that process is by setting the foam core out in the sun in the open air until the smell has dissipated. We'd also recommend washing the pillowcase and pillow cover. \"\"\"After two weeks of putting the foam out in the sun and later letting it sit out in the garage and then later in the house there is still a slight lingering smell. The pillow case hand washed out the smell after a couple of washes. Have not used the pillow as of this writing.Not sure what will do ultimately but wanted to pass on this information.",

I'm keeping it and using it in the couch because it is a nice pillow. It would have been perfect if it was heavier and about 3 inches thicker .",
