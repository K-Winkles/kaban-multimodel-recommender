To better help your pillows come to life, give them a full massage - You may beat, shake, and squish them as needed. We suggest waiting 24 hours before the first use, allowing the pillows to grow wonderfully. Ding! Laundry Time! Yep, your pillows are machine washable (thankfully): Set your washing machine to a gentle or delicate cycle with cold water under 40\u2103/104\u2109. Please wash only with mild, neutral detergents. Do not bleach. For the best clean possible, we recommend running an extra rinse cycle to make sure the soap is gone completely. Ding! Dry and Refresh For tumble drying, dryer setting matters a lot: Always dry with no or low heat in a delicate cycle. To prevent possible clumping, give your pillows a nice fluff-up after drying. Air drying is recommended. Do not iron. Ding! Newly Upgraded Washing Label How to correctly cut the washed tags? Please follow the small scissors logo on the washable label for correct cutting.Please avoid tearing or improperly cropping the washable label as it may cause the pillow to split.",

They hold their shape and have been great to sleep with. My neck problems have almost all gone away at night.",

Even after washing and drying they are still perfect and haven\u2019t flattened out. Highly recommend. Only con is it took a little longer than expected to get to me, but it was WORTH THE WAIT.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a new mattress and associated coverings for it and decided that I deserved a new set of pillows as well. For years not, I have been sleeping on a Bamboo memory foam pillow, that while I had become accustomed to it, was quite a hard pillow to sleep on. It was time for something different and after looking at what seemed to be hundreds of different pillows offered here on Amazon, I decided to order these when the price dropped on Prime Days. I am very glad I did.It is simply amazing to receive a relatively small box that contains two quite large, Queen size pillows. I was so amazed at how they had been vacuum compressed and packaged that I neglected to take pictures. It took me just a minute or two to remove both pillows from their plastic bags and watching them expand was a treat. I allowed them a full 24 hours before sleeping on them, which was not an easy thing to do. But it was well worth it. Going from a very hard and heavy pillow to these soft pillows took me a couple of nights of adjustment, but after a few days, I have adapted well to these softer but still supportive pillows.So far, I am very satisfied. I showed them to a neighbour on the day I received them, and they went an ordered a set immediately before the sale ended. At under $40 for two excellent quality pillows, it was really a no-brainer. As usual with anything I purchase, if things change I will include an edit to reflect the change. I don't really see that happening here however. They are just great pillows at any price.",
