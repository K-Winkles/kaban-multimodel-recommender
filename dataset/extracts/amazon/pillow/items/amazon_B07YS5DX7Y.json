While I\u2019m ok with that as I got it to have beside me it is definitely not a pillow I\u2019d lay my head on as it squishes to flat for that. Cover was nice and soft and washes just fine. Cover is darker in color than pictured. I\u2019ve had it for 2 months now so not a long time but I\u2019m happy with it overall.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the DOWNCOOL Luxury Full Body Pillow, and my experience has been a bit mixed. Let's start with the positive aspects.The pillowcase that comes with it is undeniably luxurious and soothing. The material feels great against the skin, and it adds a touch of comfort to the overall experience.However, when it comes to the pillow itself, I have some reservations. While it initially provides a decent level of support, it tends to lose its firmness over time. This becomes noticeable, especially during extended use. I found that the comfort between the knees, which is a crucial aspect for me, diminishes relatively quickly.Compared to some other body pillows I've tried, the DOWNCOOL pillow falls short in terms of maintaining consistent support for prolonged periods. It might work well for shorter sessions, but for those seeking a more enduring solution, this might not be the ideal choice.In conclusion, the DOWNCOOL Luxury Full Body Pillow has its merits with a lovely pillowcase, but its longevity and firmness might not meet the expectations of users seeking sustained support, particularly between the knees.",

Having one long pillow removes this issue. I sleep hot, but this pillow is still comfortable except on the warmest nights when everything is too hot. I've been using it nightly for over a year and it's just starting to get a little flat. When the time comes, I'll buy a new one of these; and when that gets flat, I'll use them together.",
