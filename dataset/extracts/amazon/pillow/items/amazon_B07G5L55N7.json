It\u2019s the best and worth a couple extra bucks to have an actual comfortable neck pillow. I used this on my trip to Switzerland and it was exactly what I needed. It\u2019s soft, provides support, rolls up and stores away easily, and has a removable/washable cover. I mean if you\u2019re looking for a travel pillow or really just a neck pillow for sitting long hours at your desk, this is great. For reference, I am a 5\u20192\u2019\u2019 petite person and this worked for me..also worked for my brother and boyfriend so it seems to be pretty standard fit. Worth it.",

I like the firmness and holds my chin comfortably up which is what I needed. It is a flatter behind the nape of the neck, which my Phys. therapist recoemmended. due to needing to sit correctly with spine straight and not slouching chin forward. The airline seats do not work well if you have a bulging pillow behind your neck pushing your head forward. Another reviewer said keep the orange packing strap to fold it up and that was smart! You can also attach with little toggles to hang on your purse or bag. Easy.",

                "reviewText": "The Cabeau pillow is really quite big and a bit awkward but it is gloriously soft and squishy. I confess it was sometimes TOO big and I would give up and toss it under my seat, but I wonder if I did not push through to figuring out how to use it? It would definitely be a better fit for larger people - small people would probably find it a bit big for their shoulders and neck. Because it's squishy, you might be able to fold it up into a pillow, and I suspect if you are waiting for a flight in an airport it might work well there as well. Take a look at it before you buy. Sorry, mine is packed away but you should be able to get a good sense of it from the sales imagery.",

                "reviewText": "I tried the Evolution 3 by this company and it's pretty good. The design is very good and the neck support is probably the best out there. What I didn't like was the thin, cheap fabric and cheap zipper. The zipper is very difficult to use and almost broke the first time I tried it. For $40 this shouldn't be happening. I also didn't care for the headrest straps. I found them annoying, and unusable for a short (under five feet) family member.So, I tried the Evolution Classic. It has most of the good features of the Evolution 3, without the straps, and with a more plush fabric. But, importantly, what they left out is a storage pouch. That's inexcusable. What this means is you have to carry this relatively bulky pillow around fully expanded, taking up a ton of room in your carry-on/backpack, or having to attach it to the outside of your carry-on. For $30, the company should have included a pouch with the pillow (almost every one else does), but they cheaped up and didn't. This pretty much forces you to shell out another $10 or so to get something to pack it in. As a consequence, you now have one of the more expensive travel pillows on the market. It also has the same cheap zipper as the Evolution 3, so be prepared for the hassle of it getting stuck or breaking.Do I recommend the Evolution Classic? Only if the lack of pouch to pack it in doesn't bother you. Otherwise, the Evolution 3 is a better deal if you're OK with the negatives I mentioned. Personally, I'm not bothering with either pillow, preferring another brand's superior design and quality.",

Lo \u00fanico que no me queda claro es c\u00f3mo limpiar el coj\u00edn de esponja de relleno, ya que si lo toca cualquier l\u00edquido lo absorbe rapid\u00edsimo y no logra secarse por dentro, y se apesta. Si lo metes a la secadora se rompe, y aunque lo dejes d\u00edas enteros bajo el sol no se seca en absoluto (as\u00ed le pas\u00f3 a mi primera almohada, me dur\u00f3 5 a\u00f1os hasta que intent\u00e9 lavar el relleno y se rompi\u00f3). Las instrucciones de lavado de la etiqueta no son nada claras. Pero fuera de eso esta almohada es una maravilla y es la mejor que he tenido. La recomiendo totalmente!!",
