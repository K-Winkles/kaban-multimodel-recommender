                "reviewText": "I ordered this set of two Pillows Queen Size Set of 2 Goose Down Pillows from Bafode because it was time to replace some of my more elderly down pillows.I have major spine issues\u2014I\u2019ve broken my neck twice, I have degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis and have several fusions. I know what I need to get comfortable enough to sleep at night. It\u2019s a complex pile of pillows that allow me to recline into them at the correct angle, supported by other, smaller pillows for my hips, knees, and the small of my back. (It sounds complicated\u2014and is\u2014but I want to sleep next to my husband, not sitting in the recliner.)My husband and I joke about our \u201cbunk bed\u201d\u2014 we sleep in a regular queen size, but I\u2019m way up on my pillow stack and he\u2019s flat on the mattress with a single memory foam pillow.I\u2019ve tried memory foam. I\u2019ve tried so many kinds of pillows, and for me, a good down pillow just does the trick. I have a heavier support pillow at the back of the stack, but the best are down. And I love these Bafode goose down pillows.When the box came, I was surprised. It seemed too small for two queen sized down pillows. They were rolled up tightly and wrapped in plastic. After I unwrapped them, I fluffed them up. I thought about fluffing them in the dryer, but just gave them a second good fluff, and they plumped up beautifully.The pillows are a soft white fabric with a great, smooth hand feel. I don\u2019t know if they are cotton or bamboo, but they have that high thread count feeling. The white pillows have blue piping around the edges. They measure 20\"x 30\u201d.These pillows remind me of the high-end pillows in a really great luxury hotel room. They are firm enough to give excellent support, but the down inside is soft and fluffy. As part of my pillow stack, they are extremely comfortable for sleeping.These pillows seem to have the exact right balance between fluffiness you can sort of mold and the support you need. They really are incredibly well made. I\u2019ve lost track of how many different types of pillows I\u2019ve tried through the years, but definitely enough for me to know that these pillows stand out from the crowd. When I settled back against them, there was a moment like\u2026 oh, yeah. That\u2019s better.Plump, fluffy goose down pillows bring high-end hotel comfort to your bedroom.",

                "reviewText": "I have never been a fan of down pillows. The ones I have used usually ended up flat with all the down ending up around my head and providing no support. A lot of folks would fold them over to address that issue.When I gave these pillows time to air out and fill out a bit, I was very surprised. They were packed well enough so that they actually maintained their thickness. There is no way to open these up, short of ripping out some sewing, but I am not aware of any filler inside the pillow. It was a snug fit to get these inside the queen size pillow cases. I've been using one now for a few nights and am very pleased.If I lay on my back, then my head ends up around the middle of the pillow. I get comfortable support there. When I lay on my side, I also get comfortable support, but that is a bit different. I use a cpap face mask and if it rests on the pillow, the pressure from that will usually push it just a bit out of position. That means I have to keep the face mask off the pillow. This being a down pillow, I can push the corner of the pillow in (and it will stay like that) so I get good support for my head, and the mask does not rest on the pillow.I'm a new fan of down pillows. These are very comfortable and work well for me. The label says the contents are 95% grey goose feathers and 5% grey goose down. I do not feel any feathers poking at me at all. Pick yourself up a couple of these.",

The 95% goose feather and 5% goose down filling creates just the right amount of cushiony loft to cradle your head without being too high.Not only do they excel in comfort, but these down pillows seem very well-made. The double layer fabric and hidden zipper closure keep the fill securely inside. I appreciate that the materials used are OEKO-TEX certified, which I appreciate.Since getting these pillows, I find myself eagerly crawling into bed, excited for a night of sublime rest. The support hits just the right spot, and waking up each morning feels more refreshing.If you want to give your bed an elevated level of comfort, I can't recommend these feather down pillows enough. The fluffy feel is perfect for dreamy, blissful nights! My search for the ideal pillow is finally over.",

My lower back had been hurting pretty badly and I was thinking it was time to get a new bed even though we just got one less than a couple of years ago. When I starting using these pillows my lower back pain significantly decreased. The Pillows are fluffy but not too hard. Your head sinks in a bit but it is still plump. This isn't too soft and is almost on the firm side even but not stiff. I would recommend giving this pillow a try is you also are experiencing lower back pain and see if it helps before replacing your bed. Who knew a pillow could help so much.",

                "reviewText": "I got 2 queen pillows. They arrived rolled and sealed in plastic. After removing the package, I let the pillows air out and fluff up for a couple of days. I've used these for a week now and really like them. They provide good support sleeping either on my back or on my side. There is enough fill that they do not go completely flat. The feathers also don't poke out of the quilted cover to stab you. The quilted material is soft. The \"height\" of the pillows are just right...not too high or too low/flat. I've used these for a week now and I would recommend them for anyone looking for a feathered pillow and doesn't want alot of \"height\".",
