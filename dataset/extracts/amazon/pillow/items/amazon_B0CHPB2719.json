It is the perfect height as most are too high. The pillow allows your head to nest perfectly and allows your arm to go up through the groove which offers perfect comfort for those who sleep with arms up under pillow. I wakeup without shoulder pain. Some complain it takes time to get used to this new pillow but the first night I had great interrupted sleep. Highly recommend for back sleepers and it works perfectly with my CPAP.",

                "reviewText": "Alright.... it's another pillow!!! How different could it be??? Among the many basic, department store pillows I've bought , this is probably the 4th or 5th \"It will change your life pillow I've bought \"! I'm not going to lie. I bought this pillow with the anticipation that I would probably be returning. Well.... here I am, 4 weeks later and, well..... I'm COMPLETELY HOOKED!!! This pillow cradles my head and neck. It feels like you have complete support, in all the right places! I tend to be a side sleeper , but I frequently try to sleep on my back for esthetic reasons. I am usually unable to get comfortable on my back. Now, I'll honestly say, I can actually get comfortable on my back. I will say, this is absolutely the most comfortable \"side sleeping pillow\". It is so comfortable lying on your side. It cradles your face and neck to perfection.! Let's also note the outer, removable, washable cover. It's a cooling material! Soft and says cool! I don't wake up sweating! I have to say, I really look forward on sleeping on the pillow each night, and absolutely recommend you try it!!!!",
