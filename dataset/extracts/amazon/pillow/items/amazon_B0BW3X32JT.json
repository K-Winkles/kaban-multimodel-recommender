                "reviewText": "I have recently updated our bedding to all white and wanted to replace my husbands standard memory foam pillows to king size. After searching and researching, I found these pillows and boy am I glad I did! When they arrived in the air tight plastic, I was worried they wouldn't fluff up. As soon as I opened the packaging, they expanded immediately! They came in very soft zipper protectors and the cool side did feel cooler to the touch than the other side. There wasn't any weird smells that I noticed. I let them sit for hours to give them time to expand completely. I sprayed them with some Lysol as I do all of our pillows. Since I'm doing all white with our bedding, I wanted them bright white and added my own protectors and cases. So each side being labeled would be impossible to see. They are VERY FIRM!!!My husband has been using them for a full week now and he speaks daily about how much he loves them! :) He is a back sleeper and the way they elevate helps him breathe better. In my opinion, if you are a smaller person and a side sleeper as I am, these pillows will require you to take some of the foam out to modify them or at least you have the option to do so! Besides feeling very rested in the morning, if you really want to know how well you've slept, look at your bedding! Since he's been using these pillows, it looks like he doesn't move all night and in the morning he could just pull the covers up to make the bed. lol! I highly recommend them!",

They do need fluffed a little every couple nights or they get smushed down funny. Pleased with the quality and price point for two.",

My brother and dad seem to enjoy the new pillows I bought them. Since they can be refilled, I truly enjoyed that. Gonna need to buy myself a set soon.",

That case is inside the cool/ warm pillow cover with a zipper. It\u2019s a beautiful cover. I then put an additional pillow cover, that I can repeatedly wash,over that before I put on the actual pillow case on. You can go in and take out as much foam as you like. Make sure to rearrange the foam evenly and to the corners. It has a faint smell from the machine that cuts the foam. If you air out when you get it, it will be fine. Or I took a handful of dusting powder, and put my hand inside and release the powder into the foam everywhere. I built the pillow to the exact size that I wanted!",
