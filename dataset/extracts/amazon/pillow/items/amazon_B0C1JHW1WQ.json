Comes vacuum packed. Made from good material and so super soft. More filling than our previous down pillow. Not over fluffy and not less too. I liked the shape of these pillows. Nice design and give good ergonomics while using.Pros:- These are super soft and very comfortable whether you use them on a bed or use these temporarily on a sofa or a table while sitting- The shape of these pillows is nice. Nice design and give good ergonomics while using.- No smell at all. Natural scent and so doesn't trouble the nostrils- Should last long being fluffy unlike other materials which settle down pretty soon- Pillow cover looks good quality too- Reasonably priced in the competitionCons:- None at this price pointHowever, I can't comment on the long run for these as got them a few days back. But I will definitely come back and update this review if I see these not working as expected in the long run",
