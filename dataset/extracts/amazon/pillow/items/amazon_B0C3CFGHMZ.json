We provide ample filling for the pillows and include a zipper for adjusting the filling. Tip: The bed pillows may not be fluffy immediately after opening, you can press it to speed up its return to its original shape.",
            "Soft and Fluffy: These bed pillows are filled with a abundant amount of high-quality 100% 3D microfiber polymester filling, which is noiseless, ultra-soft, highly supportive, and elastic. The filling is evenly distributed, providing comfortable support for your neck and shoulders.",
            "Healthy Breathable Cover: The stripe pattern on the 100%cotton pillow cover is woven using a diagonal high-density technique, greatly enhancing the durability and longevity of the pillow. It maintains its shape and gives the pillow a neat appearance while reducing wrinkles on the surface of the pillowcase, improving facial comfort during sleep.",
            "Adjustable: A hidden zipper allows for easy removal or addition of filling, enabling you to adjust the support to your preference. Note: Due to prolonged vacuum compression, some filling may rebound slowly. We recommend exposing the pillow to sunlight after pressing and tapping. This not only aids in rebounding but also provides a comfortable and healthy usage tip.",
            "Easy Care: Our bed pillows can be machine-washed with a mild detergent and tumble-dried. Regular cleaning helps keep the pillows durable and fluffy."

Having the larger insert placed into the smaller pillow case created a very full pillow. If I ordered the same size, then there would not be much fullness once placed into the pillow case.The pillow inserts arrive packaged separately in the box. They are flat due to the pressure sealed packaging.As soon as I took the pillow inserts out of their packages, they immediately puffed up.These pillow inserts are extremely well made and the price is fantastic.The zippers work great! I just love how the zippers appear to be hidden.The insert covers are made from good quality material. They are soft and beautiful. It fit beautifully in my pillow case. My pillow is very fluffy looking.The pillow insert is so well made one could use it as it is without a pillow case; but I would want to protect the insert.I am looking for a pillow case for my other insert. I could not find any pillow cases made by Oubonon. I wish they made them.I will definitely purchase more pillow inserts made by Oubonon through Amazon.",

It allows for you to stuff the pillow and immediately get the shape you desire - whether it is fluffy or you want to chop the top in the middle. I do wish you could by a king set or they had the option to purchase only one. With a king bed, I needed three and had to buy two packages of 2. Now I have a superfluous pillow.",

The craftsmanship and durability exceeded my expectations, providing both comfort and a plush aesthetic to my living space. These pillows are a great choice if you're looking for a versatile and high-quality option, and I suggest using them with slightly smaller covers for a more filling and luxurious look.",
