This adaptability enhances the overall functionality of these pillows. The value for money is evident in the thoughtful design and the option to tailor the pillow to individual comfort levels. If you appreciate a personalized sleep experience, the Flanhorest Pillows offer a satisfying blend of craftsmanship, quality, and adjustability.",

It takes a while for the compressed foam filling to expand; during this time, there is some off-gassing from the foam, so I let it air out before use.Once ready for use, the pillow is extremely comfortable. The adjustable filling is a good feature for those who want heavier or lighter fill, and there is extra filling provided.The bamboo derived rayon does a decent job wicking heat, and one side of the pillow feels cool to the touch from that - but, they only appear to have used that fabric on the side with the blue stitching. The other side has a different feel and is less cool. I do wish they had used the same fabric on the entire pillow (minus one star for only being on one side). Other than that, it is a good pillow, and a decent value for the money.",
