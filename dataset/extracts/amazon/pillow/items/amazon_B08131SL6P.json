I ordered this after trying one of the better rated shredded foam pillows..what a HUGE disappointment- hard, heavy, uncomfortable. Ordered this (comes as a 2 pack, so great deal!), opened it and let it 'fluff'- which took less than an hour, and had no discernible 'new pillow odor.' I was a bit worried it might be too poofy, but ahhh...when I put my head on it, it sank a bit yet still cradled my head and was soooo comfortable and supportive. When I woke up, I realized that I hadn't been waking up every couple of hours, like I did with my precious foam pillow, so while I can't prove it, I think this will contribute to overall better sleep. I may even order another pair to store away for the future, since it seems like whenever I find a pillow I really like, it gets discontinued, and this was a reasonable price.",

As a stomach sleeper it's difficult to find a low loft soft pillow but this is it! It's also great for sleeping on my side. Most importantly I was looking for a pillow I can bunch up under my head as needed and this does just that. Finally! Also comes at an awesome price for two pillows.",
