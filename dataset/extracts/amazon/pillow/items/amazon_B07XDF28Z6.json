I've purchased a lot of pillows looking for that one that's perfect for me. I've spent a large amount of money, more than I could afford at times, in my search. I've purchased pillows online, in high end sleep stores, promotional places and box stores. Nothing but junk!Exasperated and ready to give up, along comes Lincove into my life and finally, I've found my treasure at the end of my rainbow.....a good night's sleep and no headache in the morning anymore! It's comfortable, without being too full or flat. It surrounds my head and gives at the right time, holds at the right time and stays with me as I move at night. It's a close to perfect as is possible. It's pricey, but damn worth it! I plan to buy from Lincove exclusively. Thanks Lincove!",

                "reviewText": "Great pillow!I originally ordered the standard soft. It arrived beautifully packaged, along with a really cool travel bag.Ultimately after trying it for a few nights, however, it ended up being TOO soft, so I called Lincove customer service.Melissa was absolutely amazing, and helped guide me to a better pillow for my needs.It turns out the king-size pillow with medium fill is a better choice for me, as a side sleeper. I just needed a bit more support.The process was incredibly easy, due to Melissa\u2019s excellent customer service. Truly \u2026 she made my day with how helpful and polite she was. Service like that is incredibly rare these days. I give Lincove 5 stars for both the product AND the service.The new pillow arrived promptly, and also contained another beautiful and handy travel bag. The king size, medium fill pillow is a great fit for me, as a petite side sleeper.I\u2019ve been on the hunt for the perfect pillow for YEARS, and I think I\u2019ve finally found it. This Lincove pillow is like sleeping on a comfy cloud. Still supportive, but SO soft and marshmallow-ey.I was initially unsure about paying this much for a pillow, but then I thought about it as an investment in my sleep, and it became clear that the price is 100% worth it. After all, we use our pillows for several hours a night, every night. And the warrantee is for 5 years. Normally I replace my (lower quality) pillows about once a year. So this is a very solid investment, in my opinion.I will definitely be recommending this pillow to friends and family!",

That said, I called customer service and spoke to Melissa. She suggested that I lean on them when I am sitting down. I decided to sit on them and it is making a difference. They are still in the breaking in stage and I am sure they will only get better. I would recommend using pillow protectors if you sleep hot, plus that is the only way to guarantee the warranty.My pillows feel clean and cozy. I love how they look on my bed. Perfect for sleeping and/or leaning on. Since our needs are all so different, I cannot tell you if this is the right pillow for you, but I can suggest to call customer service and speak to them directly. As far as the company is concerned, I can highly recommend them. They really care and want to make you happy!",

I didn't want to pay the price the Ritz was asking on their website, but thought these would be a reasonable alternative. The pillows are very nice, dense but fluffy, and the shape is great. They are not quite as wonderful as the hotel's pillows, but still great.",

                "reviewText": "My experience with Lincove Pillows has been absolutely delightful, reinforcing my loyalty as a customer. Having already purchased seven pillows for my family and myself, I am a testament to the quality and comfort Lincove offers.Recently, I inadvertently bought the Lincove Cloud Natural Canadian White Down Luxury Sleeping Pillow with a 625 fill power and a 500 thread count cotton shell. While it's a fantastic pillow, I initially intended to purchase a second Lincove Signature 100% Natural Canadian White Down Luxury Sleeping Pillow, known for its firmer and fluffier feel with 800 fill power. It wasn't until after several nights of use that I realized this mix-up.What truly set Lincove apart in this instance was their customer service. Upon contacting them to explain my mistake, they immediately offered to send the correct pillow without hesitation. This gesture of goodwill was astounding. When I proposed to return the mistakenly purchased pillow, they graciously insisted I keep it. This level of customer care is rare and highly commendable.It\u2019s not just the quality of their products that makes Lincove stand out; it's their dedication to customer satisfaction. The pillows themselves are of superior quality, offering unparalleled comfort and support. The difference in fill power and thread count between the two pillows caters to diverse preferences, ensuring a perfect pillow for everyone.In conclusion, Lincove\u2019s commitment to excellence in its products and customer service has secured my continued patronage. Their pillows are an investment in quality sleep, and their customer care is a testament to their brand's integrity. I wholeheartedly recommend Lincove to anyone seeking premium pillows and exceptional service.",
