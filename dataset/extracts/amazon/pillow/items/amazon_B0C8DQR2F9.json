                "reviewText": "When I initially opened these pillows from the vacuum packaging, I felt as deflated as these pillow inserts appeared. The packaging process had packed the pillow fibers so tight that the pillow size was severely reduced and the pillows quite flat. I was certain that these would be returned before I\u2019d opened the packaging of all 8 that I purchased. I decided I\u2019d throw them in the dryer to see if the heat would help to fluff them. IT DID! It made a night and day difference. The difference is that of a deflated & inflated balloon. So, take my word on this & don\u2019t be disappointed or consider a return until trying this simple trick. In fact, these should come with instructions to to this as my opinion and full satisfaction completely altered by implementing this simple hack. Great pillows! Good price! I definitely recommend this purchase.",

They will give slight comfort but that is not their primary function. They are a bit thin individually if you plan to use them for sleep or support.",

                "reviewText": "Not a bad product and was a fair value for the quantity you receive. However, I don't like them for my purpose because I sell the pillow covers that go on the outside. These didn't/were very difficult to fluff all the way into the corner, which means my pillow covers (a slightly stiffer home decor fabric) didn't hold their form as well as I would have liked. If I used a softer fabric cover or were not placing them inside a product that I sell, they'd probably work just fine. I wouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing these for personal use as they are comfortable and fluff well overall; it's just the corners that are challenging to get to pop out. I don't know if they will hold their support over time, though.",

I took them out of the vacuum packaging when I received them (it\u2019s been over a month) and I\u2019m still waiting on them to fluff up.
