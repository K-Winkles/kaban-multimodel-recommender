                "reviewText": "What sold me on this pillow was that you can adjust the filling. I needed a specific shape and height for comfort and I couldn't figure out the specifics until I got this pillow.This pillow arrived in a box and in the box was the pillow in a plastic vacuum-sealed package. It fluffed up after removing it from the package. It was very fluffy after setting it out and waiting. It comes with outside pillow case and a pillow case to hold the memory foam (already assembled), both have zippers.For my preferences I would remove the memory foam bit by bit from the pillow and return into the package and laid down on the pillow until it felt comfortable enough. I removed quite a lot as I wanted a pillow that was more on the partially flatter side, tied the bag, then stored the rest in the box in case I needed to replace the memory foam.At times I have noticed that the pillow would change shape after I remove the pillow cover for laundry and then put it back on for bed. I prefer a flatter pillow in the middle with puffy sides and at times it would completely be puffy. After readjusting though I don't really notice it and have not regretted my purchase.Also I have a physical issue (pulled muscles near my shoulder) and the pillow has taken weight off my shoulder so it can heal better. Also no neck pain issues.Honestly I would recommend it. It is very comfortable and I found a great pillow for my sleeping needs.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many pillows over the years, down, down blend, down alternative and memory foam. The most comfortable for my neck that keeps it's shape and doesn't go flat after a few weeks/month has been memory foam.After a few years, my favorite memory foam pillow needed replaced. When I could no longer find the same pillow the dreaded hunt was on to find one that worked as well. For I was quite spoiled with my previous pillow.I look for a pillow that does not push back, but gently hugs me. If I fall to sleep and wake in the same position without any pain it's a dream come true.Well let me tell you about DreamyBlue. Of course it comes vacuumed sealed in the most lovely packaging and extra fill is included if needed.After opening, I tossed it in the dryer on low heat for about 10 minutes. The outer cover is luxurious and very soft to the touch with a smooth zipper. The inner cover also has a smooth quality zipper for modifying the amount of fill. Overall the materials used are extremely high quality and perfectly designed for sleeping.I slept the first night without modifying the fill. I slept pretty good, but it wasn't perfect. I then decided to start modifying the fill since I have a smaller head. (Youth sized.). After unzipping the outer and inner covers I started by removing only 1 large handful of memory foam. The memory foam is much different from any other memory foam pillow I have tried and I have tried more than I can count. It's more shredded than large chunks and the feel is soft and silky unlike most that feel somewhat like foam rubber.After modifying the fill I fluffed the pillow with my hands. (Kind of like a massage.) I went to sleep and woke in the morning in the same position. I opened my eyes pleasantly surprised and sat up with no pain in my neck or shoulders. Every night since has been the same and I have to confess that this pillow far exceeds not only my expectations, but is even more comfortable that the pillow that I had to replace.If you're thinking of purchasing this pillow, you will also be pleasantly surprised by the quality, comfort and price.The product arrived quickly and the customer service is outstanding.I have at last found my perfect pillow!!!All pillows need replaced at some point and I will be replacing this one with the same DreamyBlue.Thank you DreamyBlue for a truly wonderful product inside and out. If I could rate higher than 5 stars I certainty would.Sweet dreams everyone.",

Personally, I like pillows that are on the firm side of firm, and when I received the pillow, I felt like it needed additional filling to meet my needs ( this purely my preference, and I would bet that 99% of people would be happy as it was shipped). After reaching out and contacting the company, the owner responded quickly and was able to send additional filling.Between a quality product and great customer service, I would recommend you giving this pillow a look!",

When the pillow came I just popped it in the dryer for a couple minutes and voila, all fluffed up. I'm a side sleeper so I started with the amount of filling the pillow came with. Turned out to be a bit too much for me. Once I figured the perfect amount for me the pillow is so comfortable. It's been 2 1/2 months and still like new. The quality of the pillow is great. I love the outer portion and that there is a second zippered portion with the filling. I have had other bamboo filled pillows where you could adjust the filling before and they didn't have that. I also really like the type of filling. This pillow was worth every penny.",

I did what most other commenters did and put this pillow in the dryer for a few minutes to fluff it out nicely. On my first sleep (I'm a side and stomach sleeper) I found the pre-stuffed amount to be too much, so I took out a bunch of stuffing the next day. I actually took even more out after my second sleep and have now found the perfect amount. I love it because it supports my neck and head when I'm on my back, yet also also has the perfect consistency for side or stomach sleeping. No more neck pain and I'm waking up fewer times in the night. The lifetime warranty was easy to sign up for (took 5 seconds) and I've got more than enough stuffing to refill the pillow in the future (as it also comes with extra stuffing, not that I need it now). I am over the moon about this purchase, time to count a few sheep :)",
