                "reviewText": "I was beginning to believe comfortable pillows were a thing of the past. It seems most of the pillows being made these days are out of memory foam and they just aren't comfortable. I remembered pillows as a kid (I'm 59) being very comfortable and that was because the were filled with feathers and down. I started to look for down pillows and they are very expensive these days. I decided to give these a chance and they are awesome. I can't wait to rest my head on them. I got the King size pillows even though I have a Queen bed and I glad I did. Normally I use two pillows for myself and now I just need the one and my wife uses the other that came as a pair.",

They are huge & good quality but just not Fluffy & lite",
