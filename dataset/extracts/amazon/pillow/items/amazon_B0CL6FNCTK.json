                "reviewText": "This is almost an exact dupe for the tempurpedic cloud pillow! I have the cloud pillow and have used it for 2-3 years now every night. It is a fantastic pillow but was starting to get a bit too squishy and less firm than when I first purchased it so I thought it time to try a new pillow. I just so happen to find this pillow on amazon and decided to give it a shot because it is a good price. I am absolutely blown away by the quality of this inight pillow. It\u2019s just as good if not BETTER than tempurpedic. When laying on the expensive tempurpedic cloud pillow and then immediately laying on the inight pillow they have a very similar feel, density, comfort, etc. It\u2019s not too soft or too firm. It\u2019s not too thick or thin. It\u2019s the perfect height and density for side sleepers. The cover it comes in is high quality and soft. I can\u2019t speak for the longevity because I\u2019ve only had it a short time but I\u2019m sure it will hold up just fine. I will update my review if I have any issues. This is a 100% honest review I purchased this pillow with my own hard earned money. I plan to purchase a few more since they are such a great price. I\u2019ve tried soooo many memory foam pillows from Amazon and also mattress stores and this one is a real winner. I\u2019m absolutely shocked at how great of a value this is. If you are looking for something similar to a tempurpedic cloud (if not better\u2026) definitely get this! I love how this pillow has ventilation so your head doesn\u2019t get too hot. Please don\u2019t put memory foam in the washing machine. Only wash the cover. I saw a poor review where someone gave this pillow one star because they put the whole memory foam pillow in the washing machine. SMH. I thought it was common knowledge to not do this. I thought it was worth mentioning. Anyways, I 100% recommended this pillow! You really get bang for your buck. I would only go back to tempurpedic cloud if they stop making this pillow.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Memory foam Pillow",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So I purchased the 5 inch memory foam pillow and the gel memory foam pillow which is 4.7 inches and found that there is not really much difference at all in the memory foam perhaps a one second rebound on the 5 inch memory foam, not certain why they call it memory foam because it really does not have much rebound like the original expensive ones but they certainly hold or shape and are very comfortable. In terms of the cooling gel, I really did not see much difference after 30 minutes of use it seem to reach a higher temperature of my body. Therefore, the gel will actually warm up to my faces body temperature and no longer would stay cool. I think that the concept is good but it does not stay cool very long. So I decided to return the memory gel foam and keep the 5 inch since it was thicker and works better for me. For most people I believe that would be a good height because it\u2019s thick enough to support your neck if you suffer from whiplash injuries and providing you\u2019re not a short person under five feet. I don\u2019t only sleep on my back, but I sleep every which way as well as on my stomach so it seems to be a good size pillow and did not take very long to expand to its full size after opening the package. It also has a little bit of odor From the memory foam, but not extremely bad considering I have allergies. I believe it lasted probably five days at most if you let it air out. So anyway, I have to give it a good 5 star rating because all in all it is a very good and comfortable pillow. I no longer have headaches and sleep longer at night nor do I have kinks in my neck that I would get from other pillows so I do recommend this and hope that this comment will help you decide which pillow would work for you.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I need new pillows to replace our aging down fill pillows. That my wife strongly disliked for being too soft, but I liked because I sleep on all sides back, side and stomach. She recently purchased standard size memory foam pillows from Costco, that to me are like overstuffed pills that the pillows must wrapped in a pillowcase twice the size of the pillow. Therefore, the mission was to find a better pillow. I purchased the two top-rated King-size memory foam pillows on Amazon, the Weekender Gel Memory Foam Pillow and inight Memory Foam. Both are a good choice, however I preferred the Weekender only because it was a little firmer, especially towards the end of the pillow, and the middle was the same softness as the inight. Weirdly the inight is heavier than the Weekender. Also, to be clear we are keeping both brands of pillows. I found both pillow brands to hit the balance between soft and supportive, even when I moved from back to side to stomach, between the two brands I tried the Weekender was the more optimal of the two. This feature truly sets it apart from other pillows I have tried in the past and has greatly improved my sleep quality. These are hands down better than the down-filled pillows, IMHO. I also appreciate that the pillowcase is luxurious and machine-washable, which makes it easy to keep clean and fresh. I do slobber a bit \u2013 TMI.Overall, I highly recommend the Weekender Gel Memory Foam Pillow - king size to anyone in the market for a new pillow. It has exceeded my expectations and has greatly improved my sleep experience. My wife, who generally pops out of bed in the morning, wanted to stay in bed a little longer to enjoy it.",

So much so that I got up at 3am, in a huff, to organise its return.The following day, after a dreadful night's sleep, I went for a nap and reluctantly didn't bother changing the pillow. I thought I would give it another try. Just to see whether it made any difference, I decided I would rotate it 180 degrees, so that the neck support was at the top. I appreciate that defeats the purpose of it, but I thought anything was worth a shot.Wow.I slept and slept, much like Jenny in Forrest Gump. The difference in comfort was unbelievable.If you are having trouble with the neck support, give it a little 18, sleep on the flat part and thank me later. The material of the pillow is wonderfully comfortable. It's firm and it stays much cooler than standard pillows.I am so glad I didn't let my initial lack of sleep force me to make a bad decision and return this pillow.",
