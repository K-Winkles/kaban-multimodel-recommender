Per the instructions, I put them in the dryer for a little while after I first got them. That seemed to help a little and the smell went away after a couple days.They come extremely full of the foam material inside. I had to remove about half of the stuffing for them to be comfortable, but I like that they include all the extra and removing/adding the material is very easy.They are very fluffy and comfortable. They get nice and cool very quickly.",

We also have the cheap foam ones that I hate and you are lucky if you get 3 months out of them. I ordered a set of these during prime after going through all the different pillows available. These pillows are awesome. We have had them for about a month and they are just as good as the day we got them. You can adjust the amount of filling but we liked them how they came. The cover for them is great. It's thick and has a soft side and a cool side. And the cool side actually stays cool. We just ordered another set for our daughter for Christmas. I would absolutely recommend these pillows.",

                "reviewText": "Having researched a fair bit for the perfect pillow, I'm glad I did because this has given me the best nights sleep in a fair few years. I suffer with Crohn's and been in flare for a long time. I can't remember the last nights undisturbed sleep I had but since getting this pillow the health of my sleep is vast improving and an added benefit is my neck pains are easing a lot.I love that you can reduce the firmness and fullness of the pillow by taking some memory foam out, to get the perfect ratio for you. The added feature of the cool and warm side is perfect for when I have them night sweats and tropical moments from meds. It is a feature I never knew I needed.It is the kind of pillow you would take everywhere with you for them weekends away. So go so that I bought another a few days later for a present. A VERY GOOD INVESTMENT",

                "reviewText": "This pillow is well made and the cooling technology really does work. When you first unwrap it, the pillow looks as flat as a pizza box. After 24 hours, it expands to full size. It is well-stuffed and quite high. Unfortunately, it is simply too firm for me. Even if you take out some of the stuffing, it doesn\u2019t change how firm the memory foam is overall. The spot where your head rests does soften a little, but if you turn your head to the side, it is like bringing your head out of a hole and onto a rock.If you love a firm pillow, this might be for you. If you sleep in one position and never move your head, this might be for you. Too firm for me.",
