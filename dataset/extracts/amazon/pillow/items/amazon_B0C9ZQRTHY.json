                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Others have described this pillow as too small but it is perfect for me. I am using it to separate my knees while I sleep. I am a side sleeper with my knees bent. The bones on the sides of my knees are sharp and hurt when my legs are aligned one on top of the other. This pillow allows there to be separation and no more pain of pointy bones poking each other. The elastic strap keeps the pillow in place without being too tight. I don't even notice the strap at all. The cover comes completely off for washing since the zipper goes all the way around. The cover also seems much more durable than many of the other leg pillow covers I saw. The cover is slippery so it won't get resistances while turning over. The first night I didn't use the strap and at some point in the night the pillow escaped to the floor so I have used the strap ever since. I toss and turn when I sleep but somehow the pillow stays in place when I flip from one side to the other. The pillow is very comfortable with just the right amount of firmness to keep my knees apart. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to get this pillow. If it helps, I am 5 foot 3 inches and 122 lbs and the curve of the pillow cradles my lower thigh perfectly. If you are looking for a leg pillow to separate your knees and keep your hip and legs properly aligned while you sleep on your side, you need this pillow. I sometimes flip to my back for a bit before turning to the other side and the pillow stays comfortably in place. I hope this helps, I had so many different pillows in my cart for over a week before selecting this particular pillow and I am very happy I chose this one.",

                "reviewText": "This pillow actually offers a decent amount of support for the shape that it is. I was a little hesitant about it, but I really like it. The comfort level is great with the strap fitting snug, but not overly tight. The fabric is soft and not scratchy at all, which is great for those, like me, with sensitive skin. I will say that if I lay in one position too long, whichever leg is on top of the pillow will start to ache. However, that I think is more just a \"me\" issue versus a pillow issue. I have lower back and hip issues and this is my first time using something like this, so it really be my body adjusting to a knee pillow. I do recommend this product for it's comfort. It does sink down as it is made out of a soft memory foam, but bounces back quickly after every use. It hasn't gone flat or lost any of it's dimension. The way it dips in the middle does provide a certain amount of stability for your leg as it rests there. Overall, I have noticed a difference in my quality of sleep and in my pain level while I sleep and when I get up. Like I said, the only issue is if I lay on one side too long. I would definitely recommend for anybody with narrower hips that are looking to stabilize them while you sleep. It works well.",

                "reviewText": "first I thought the strap would be an issue because it was not very snug but I realized this was a benefit because I didn't feel any pressure from it during the night. I also found that it stayed jn position well even when turning. As far as comfort, I think it was very comfortable overall and did not seem to over heat the area. I like the fact it can be opened and washed and the zipper is nearly invisible so it will never be felt. For me the optimal position was just above the knee and it conformed well there.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a side sleeper with hip pain. I've been using a normal bed pillow but was tired of it taking up so much room under the covers, and wanted something smaller. This is small...very small. As a larger male, it might end up being too small for me. It does have the strap to keep it in place but I'm not such a fan of it. But it seems well made, the material is soft and comfortable, and I like the shape of it. The memory foam is firm but not the firmest. It would be a good fit for anyone who wants a smaller leg pillow.",

Everything about the design is wonderful and the leg strap is perfect to keep it in place while being very comfortable and not noticeable while wearing it.

I have a chronic pain issue and have a lot of trouble sleeping. I have exactly slept better since I got my pillow. It\u2019s soft and the memory foam is great. It springs right back into shape after use. The pillow helps to align my hips and knees which is where most of my pain is. It helps to alleviate some of the pain and allows me to fall asleep. I am so grateful for that. This is an amazing product!",

                "reviewText": "Although I will say it helped keep my body better aligned the downside was the pillow for me was way too firm to be comfortable for very long. I'm either pushing it away or forcing myself to use it which just causes me sleep issues.Pillow as also much smaller than I thought it would be. I was thinking it would be a bit bigger and wider. I think that might have helped a little bit if it was, because trying to keep the pillow balanced between my legs has been difficult. I know, it has a strap, but I cannot tolerate the strap either. If I didn't feel the strap clenching around my leg, it would be fine, but I feel it way too much when it's around my leg.",
