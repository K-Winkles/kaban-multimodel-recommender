            "MEDIUM FIRM CERTIPUR-US MEMORY FOAM PILLOWS PROVIDE SUPERIOR SUPPORT FOR YOUR NECK: Too soft or too firm contour pillow can not provide just right support relaxing your neck. We chose medium firm CertiPUR-US memory foam suitable for most people to make contour pillow, providing superior support with 8 heights for different people's neck curve for less neck pain. Our adjustable cervical pillow won't go flat after a long time using.",
            "ICE COOLING PILLOW FOR HOT SLEEPERS: Our cervical pillow adjustable is a removable and washable cooling cover. You can gently hand wash or dry clean the pillowcase. The soft cooling material provides a cooler sleeping experience than cotton and makes you cool all night. Our contour pillow adjustable has ventilation holes to help alleviate excessive heat build-up.",
            "INNER PILLOWCASE FOR LONGER SERVICE LIFE: Each layer of adjustable memory foam pillows is equipped with an inner pillowcase, which can protect the memory foam from being torn while adjusting the cervical pillow. It is very convenient to adjust the contour pillow with the inner case. It can prevent memory foam layers from sticking together.",
            "A LIFETIME WARRANTY WE CAN ASSURE YOU: We can give you a lifetime warranty on your adjustable contour pillow. For any reason you are not entirely happy, we will replace or return your contour pillow. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. We will provide you 7x24 hours service.",
            "USING IT AT A ROOM OF IDEAL TEMPERATURE FOR PROPER SOFTNESS: The softness/firmness of the memory foam is affected by ambient temperature. We recommend keeping the memory foam at a room temperature of 15 to 20 degrees for a period of time to achieve the ideal softness.",
            "EXPLANATION OF MEMORY FOAM'S ODOR: When you open the package, the contour pillow adjustable may still have a \"foamy \" smell because we packaged cervical pillow quickly after producing. Our memory foam is certified by CertiPUR-US. Using the contour pillow directly is not harmful. If you really mind it, You can take the cervical pillow core out of the pillowcase and let your side sleeper pillow air out for 2 days or wash the pillowcase of your cervical pillow. This smell will fade away."

I recommend this pillow for anyone with cervical issues. With the layers, you will find this pillow to be exactly what everyone has been searching high and low for. I have had mine for 2 months..this is perfect for back and side sleeping.",

                "reviewText": "After trying many other pillows I purchased the Lofe Adjustable Pillow in 2022 to alleviate waking up with neck pain/stiff neck. It's a great pillow. I'm a small framed 63 year old male weighing about 125 lbs. I'm a back sleeper, and sleep with the lower side of the pillow under my neck. I love the fact that you can change the height or loft of the pillow by removing one or more of the memory foam layers. After experimenting with the different combinations I achieved pain free results with all the layers in place. I was truely surprised! Being petite I figured a lower loft would be better for me, but I was wrong. The pillow is supportive without feeling hard like your head is on a brick. My head creates a slight indentation in the pillow. It is not springy like latex pillows that sometimes feel bouncy like they're pushing up against your head. This pillow also stays cool. I think this pillow is a great value. After 1 year this pillow looks as good as new. I hope readers find this review helpful.",

                "reviewText": "Works great for my small 7 year old daughter on the lowest level. Will be buying the travel size for myself as after trying the regular one I think the travel size will be better for me with 2 layers which is pretty similar to the regular one with 1 layer. The only thing I could say is that the pillow case it comes with slides a little which isn't optimal with how my bed is but I can just shove something in that gap at the top and it's fine. The softness of this is also perfect as pillows that are too firm will give me headaches and make me feel lightheaded but this one is great. Soft but not too soft you sink too much. I am 130-145 pounds as I'm sure different weights work different with different pillows. It's REALLY hard to find a decent flatter pillow WITH the neck curve. Please do try this one",
