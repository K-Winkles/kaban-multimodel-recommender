                "reviewText": "For many years I have had back and neck pain issues and was searching for a new pillow to help alleviate. Another issue is I tend to sleep hot. What I decided to do was buy four or five different pillows here on amazon and return the pillows that didn't meet my needs. During this trial I bought a down pillow, a foam pillow, a down alternative pillow, and this cushion lab pillow.After a few nights with each pillow, I removed and returned them one by one. The down pillows were downright hot and tended to go flat at night. The memory foam pillow was supportive but also ran a bit hot. The down alternative pillow was just not to my liking at all as it felt cheap.I was getting desperate as this pillow was the final one to demo, and if it didn't work out, it was back to my old pillow. Fortunately, upon unboxing of this pillow, I immediately realized that this pillow was different! The cover is fantastically soft like silk. It was also cool to the touch (almost a bit cold feeling)! The feel was like a gel memory foam but even more resilient like the feel from a latex bed. I went to sleep that night and slept so well! The pillow somehow managed to cool (not cold) through the night. It has the perfect support and cushion-feeling for back sleeping where it slightly cradles your head.Most of the time I start on my back and tend to roll onto my side later at night. When rolling to the side, I'm not sure how it works, but the support transitions to perfect side sleeping support! Needless to write, this pillow is a game changer for me. I have been sleeping so much better and my neck pain is gone!!! I'm so happy with this product that I'm buying a second one to reward this company with my loyalty and so both pillows with be the same.I'd like to say thank you to this company for making such a unique and well tested product! If you are a back or side sleeper, give it a try! There's a high probability it will work for you!",

                "reviewText": "I am a back sleeper. I need a soft pillow because with firm memory foam pillows or pillows with inadequate support means that I wake up with a migraine. This is perfectly soft. It's not too firm, like some memory foam or cervical pillows. There is no pressure. It's really just what I was looking for. For the first time in YEARS I slept the entire night through without tossing and turning and without fluffing my pillow (I usually go for 100% goose down because I need both softness and support). The curves in the pillow perfectly cradle your head. Really the perfect pillow.There is an odor, but I have never seen a memory foam that doesn't have an odor. Just air it out and it wears off. I put a pillow case over it and I slept fine. The odor isn't that strong and I am very sensitive to odors.I did not notice any heat retention.To compare: I think Purple pillows are too firm and I do not like the feel of the grid. Tempur-pedic material is too firm and I wake up with a headache when I used their pillows. Also, the height is not right. They do not provide adequate support. Goose down is great, but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night and re-fluffing my pillow or putting my arm under to provide additional support. Plus, those poor geese. :( The cervical memory foam pillows are too firm, causing me to turn side to side and leaning up against those weird wings (that don't look that attractive on the bed or in a standard pillowcase). The gel fiber pillows are half-way decent (better than the old poly batten material), but are similar to goose down in that they need. to be fluffed and do not provide adequate support. The shredded memory foam pillows are too firm and they claim to be \"adjustable\" but when you take out the memory foam, it just feels like you are also taking out support and have half a pillow that also needs to be constantly fluffed.",

                "reviewText": "Pillows are like mattresses. They are difficult to do reviews on, because everyone is a little different on shape, weight and preferences.I tried this pillow and it was just a little to high for my neck. Or my head was too lightweight,\u2026It put a slight bend in my neck and prevented sound sleep. So,.. I did like any good dad, and gave it to my teenage daughter. \ud83d\ude05Unlike me, it fit her neck like a glove and was super comfy for her. Probably more than I would typically spend on a child\u2019s pillow,.. but she likes it and she\u2019s not a kid anymore, so I figure it\u2019s a good investment if she\u2019s getting good quality sleep each night.As far as the pillow itself. It had a light smell of memory foam. Nothing too crazy or chemically.The firmness is cushy but firm. I\u2019d say it tilts toward firm. It says it is for back, tummy or side sleeping,.. but I couldn\u2019t see using it for side sleeping,.. with it\u2019s high peaks in the corners it always seemed to smash my cheek and cut off air supply to that side\u2019s nostril.But of you\u2019re a back sleeper, it cradles the head nicely.Sorry to be a mixed bag about the review,.. but I have to be honest. I struggled to get any sleep on it for several days before gifting it to my daughter, who absolutely loves it. In addition to this, there are many glowing reviews here on Amazon.My advice would be to try it, and utilize the Amazon return process if you end up not liking it. Not because it isn\u2019t an excellent pillow,. But because it\u2019s very expensive if it doesn\u2019t work for you.But if like my daughter, you end up loving it,.. and if it saves you one coffee or energy drink a day,\u2026 it\u2019s well worth the cost to get a solid night\u2019s sleep.",

Once it was full size, I could see that it looked just like the photo. It\u2019s actually quite heavy and dense but when you put your head on it, it feels like a cloud. So smooth and cushy. I absolutely loved it. No neck pain. So I ordered another one, the exact same pillow a few weeks later. For some reason, this one did not plump up. It just sort of sat there, looking at me. After 36 hours, even though the memory foam had risen somewhat, it just did not look like the original pillow. It felt compact under my head, and had no give to it. The first pillow did some off-gassing and after a day, I didn\u2019t notice it much. But the second pillow, oof. So smelly. I didn\u2019t want to return it, but I had no choice. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the disappointing 2nd purchase.",
