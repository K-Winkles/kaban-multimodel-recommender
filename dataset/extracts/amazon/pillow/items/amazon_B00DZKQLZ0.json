Bought extras for each room.After our lengthy journey back from Asia, which included a taxing 20-hour combination of flights and airport layovers, I decided to surprise my spouse with this neck pillow for the holidays. Despite never having used one before, my spouse has been overjoyed with it. It has become a constant presence in our daily life, offering relief while reading in bed, working at the desk, or lounging during movie nights. It's a rare sight to see them this pleased with a gift. Due to its success, I've gone ahead and purchased several more, ensuring we have one in every key area of our house, and I'm planning to get another one to keep exclusively with our travel gear. Its plush comfort is truly a standout feature.",

I\u2019d say it was uncomfortable until I adjusted to it.- It was too small to snap while wearing (size 17 neck) but was fine unsnapped.- A frequent flyer should be looking for a better option, but that should be a given.Overall, not a perfect solution but if you\u2019re in need of something quick and cheap, this is a good option for a budget neck pillow. I needed one overnight so my options were limited and I don\u2019t fly much so I wasn't looking to make an investment.",
