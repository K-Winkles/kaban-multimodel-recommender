                "reviewText": "An excellent product so far. They are very heavy with a dense weave, which might be why some say they are noisy. They're about like a crisp bedsheet I'd say would be a good analogy. They are not waterproof, nor are they intended to be, which is fine. Waterproof ones would really be noisy due to the addition of vinyl or whatever.Perhaps they are not the softest, but since they are used under a pillowcase, durability is the greater priority. The zipper is covered by two flaps of material from either side, which is a nice touch. I've only washed them a couple of times so far, but they are holding up just fine.I used one of them to stuff with extra shredded memory foam removed from an overstuffed pillow to make a new pillow. Worked great. The only improvement I'd like is a smaller zipper pull to make it less noticable, but that is minor.",
