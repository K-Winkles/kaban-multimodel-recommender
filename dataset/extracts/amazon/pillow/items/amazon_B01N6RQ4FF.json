I got a specific pillow there which I've had for at least 3 years that isn't made anymore even direct supply from the manufacturer! When I needed a new pillow, I was worried I wouldn't find a dense, firm pillow with cooling like my old one had. While it's not exactly the same, this pillow is a pretty darn good replacement. I'm a side sleeper with shoulder and neck issues, and this pillow is a good amount of support but still comfortable enough to sleep on. I do wish it held it's shape just slightly more than it does, but it's much better than a \"standard\" memory foam pillow. It's not quite as cool as my old pillow (which had a layer of cooling gel on top of the pillow, this one is just built-in to the pillow itself) it does seem to keep decently cool throughout the night. I'm glad to have a decent replacement pillow, and on sale this one was half the cost of my last. I'd say it's worth trying out!",

                "reviewText": "Soo I have been on the search for a nicE pillow that didn't flatten after a week & since we got a king bed we needed a king pillow anyway so I purchased this one. I am a side sleeper who like to rest their leg on something while sleeping and I have used this pillow for that purpose and let me say it's been THE BEST PURCHASE EVER !!! I have had this pillow a few years now and I couldn't be more happier !! It's nice & firm but not too firm but also not too soft it's the PERFECT amount of firmness. I can not stress enough you need this pillow if you're a fellow side sleeper too. I do want to note that the cover is removable & washable ! So that's a plus too",

Not as comfortable when I lie on my back as the memory foam is a bit too firm. Pillow stays relatively cool compared to some other memory foam pillows I have had in the past.",

When I first sunk my head into it, it did that gentle sink that foam pillows do. However, this pillow is TALL. Nearly 5 inches. It seemed to continue to expand a day or two after removing from package. I gave it 3 nights, but it gave me headaches each night and was just a bit too high for my neck. I had to return. Too bad.",

                "reviewText": "I am in no way compensated for this review. I'm surprised this pillow doesn't have a better rating. I bought one for myself after a year and a half of both in-store and online pillow shopping. I was surpingly satisfied. It didn't bowl me over in any specific way, and maybe that's just what some of us need in a pillow. I'm in my 40s and have a bad back. This pillow offered moderate support at the right height, moderate firmness/softness. It was low-key perfect. No more neck aches, no fidgeting with the pillow in the wee hours to get a comfy fit. Pro-tip: put the wider side of the pillow toward your neck or downward, if that makes sense. Not above your head, but under your neck of face.My husband was also complaining about a pillow he'd got in store so I had him try mine. This was a year after I bought mine, and it's held up well. He liked it, so I bought one for him and he's a happy camper. Somehow it even suits his thick neck and broad shoulders. I'm slender, myself.I also got a back up for myself, a third pillow. In case this specific pillow become unavailable in the future. I don't want to go nearly two years again searching for an adequate replacement.",

With the memory foam, this pillow never flattens out completely so there is never any pressure on any part of your head, only support. It\u2019s not super soft, but it is extremely comfortable. I find myself sleeping MUCH better after switching to this one. Works well with back or side sleeping. So happy I bought this.",

Al d\u00eda siguiente lo us\u00e9 un momento y me qued\u00e9 dormido sin darme cuenta.

Es una gran almohada y en promoci\u00f3n es una gran inversi\u00f3n. Como es mi primera almohada memory foam y mi primera experiencia con ellos, no puedo comparar con otras marcas: pero s\u00ed puedo decir que es la mejor almohada que he comprado y estoy casi seguro de que tambi\u00e9n lo disfrutar\u00e1s.Lo \u00fanico que podr\u00eda decir es que tard\u00f3 2 d\u00edas en llegar, pero en realidad vale la pena la espera de esos 2 d\u00edas m\u00e1s las 24 horas de dejarlo reposar para usarlo; aunque, si tienes alguna emergencia, es mejor que optes por otra compra.",
