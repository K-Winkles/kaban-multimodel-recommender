The quality of the memory foam and materials far exceeded my expectations.My friends absolutely love them.I couldn't help but to order one for myself. It arrived yesterday and last night, I got the best night sleep I've had in awhile with it. It's like sleeping on a nice, soft but supportive cloud. I have a habit of jerking my neck in my sleep in an effort to keep my head and neck supported.I didn't have to adjust my neck one time with it.I will say that I do put a small pillow underneath this pillow just because I like to have my head slightly elevated because it helps improve my airway and therefore my breathing.I definitely recommend this pillow \ud83d\ude0a",

It suppose to be a cooling foam but does not seem to cool at all. That is why I only gave it a 3/4 star.",

I primarily bought this pillow for the after surgery time period, but decided to try it out. I wish it was slightly softer for side sleeping (as the pillow I normally use for that is), but it is versatile for both. I would recommend this pillow. If you want to sleep either on your side or on your back, it is easy to switch the pillow around.",
