The secret is the ability to easily remove some of the filler and customize the pillow to suit your own needs. It comes fairly firm and high but I took about a third of the filling out and it is perfect! Conforms to my head but does not go flat, plumps right up when you shake it and the firmness is perfect now! My husband only took about a quarter of the filling out of his pillow as he likes it firmer than I do and his pillow is now perfect too. Get this pillow you won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "I have bought and sent back numerous pillows I was a little worried about these at first because they were wrapped so tight they were completely flat I put them in my pillowcase and walked away and when I came back they had filled up the pillow case completely they are nice and firm and they don't lose shape when you lay your head down on them and I've also been told by my partner that I no longer snore so that is a win-win all around I've woken up with a great night's sleep and without any back or neck pain like I did with other pillows I've even tried pillows that said they were for specifically to stop snoring and they did not help these pillows are a win all around",

I haven\u2019t used it to sleep on directly but the ability to customize it for what you want is great. No smelly odors and comes in two zipper cases.
