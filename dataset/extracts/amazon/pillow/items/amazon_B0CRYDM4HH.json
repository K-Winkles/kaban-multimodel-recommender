Nothing was great. I'm pretty active and my chiropractor is great but I have woken up with neck/shoulder pain most days for the last 8 years. Pretty much figured I've always got to stretch it out before it feels decent every dang morning. I read the feedback for this pillow and liked the idea behind the design, plus liked that you could adjust it by removing foam if needed. I popped it out of the box, let it expand, then squished and fluffed all the sections so that the foam could do it's thing. This is my pillow. \u2764\ufe0f Zero neck pain, zero shoulder cramping. It's day 5 and I am blissed out. Ordered another so I have one in reserve. This pillow is amazing!!!",

While the price may initially seem steep, the long-term benefits far outweigh the cost. Investing in my sleep health has been one of the best decisions I've made, and this pillow has been the cornerstone of that investment. I'm very happy my hubby talked me into investing in a more expensive pillow, it is worth it!!",

I am so glad I didThe pillow is made of shredded memory foam and cotton, which makes it soft yet supportive. It conforms to my head and neck shape, providing optimal alignment and comfort. It also has a zipper that allows me to adjust the loft and firmness of the pillow according to my preference. The pillowcase is removable and washable, which is very convenient.

Several times over the past few months I've had a cramp in my neck upon waking, but I have not felt that at all since using this pillow. It has definitely improved the quality of my sleep and I feel up feeling so much better. What a difference a good pillow makes in helping you sleep better and helping you wake up feeling ready for the world.",
