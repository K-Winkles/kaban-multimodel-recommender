I wake up with no neck or back pain and love the functional design! I bought my first one in September and bought a second in December as a gift for my boyfriend because I loved it so much- must buy!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this pillow for a three month now. At first, I had to get use to the way it was curved but now that I have, I have no neck pain. It\u2019s comfortable on the neck and shoulders. I like the grooves for your arms, as I am someone who sleeps with my arms above head at times, but I also sleep on my side. The pillow does come with a cover, but it would be nice to fine pillowcases for this. You can fit put a regular pillowcase on it, it just looks funny. Overall I would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about purchasing memory foam (I find it heats-up too much) and an unusual shape as we're all built differently, but after spending way too much money trying to find the best pillow, I'm thrilled to have this one! It's evident a lot of thought went into designing a pillow that will accommodate most people. I'm a back and side sleeper and since purchasing this pillow, I've experienced deep sleep and pain-free mornings - finally! I've slept using both heights and find both comfortable with no neck strain or my head feeling confined or tightly cradled. My favorite pillows have usually been latex because of the floating-like feeling that alleviates pressure, but the ergonomic contour of this pillow elevates comfort to a higher level.",

My head still gets hot at night but not as hot as with a regular pillow. This one you cannot turn over when it gets hot, only one sided.",

                "reviewText": "My neck/shoulder and jaw pains are gone!When I sleep on my side, I use my hands to support my chin. Problem is, I unconsciously push against my chin & cheeks and end up hurting myself (the effect is like punching the side of my face).With this pillow's ergonomic shape and firmness, I don't have to use my hands to support the side of my head. Lying flat, the pillow cradles my neck and the back of my head firmly but gently. It also helps reduce snoring and facilitates breathing.This is the perfect product! I will order another one for when I travel so I dont have to toss and fidget with those strange hotel/guestroom pillows. Thank you FAIORD!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this pillow a little over a month ago, and feel like enough time has passed to give it a fair review. I have chronic back and neck pain and it's been very difficult to find a pillow that will give both comfort and support, the FAIORD pillow has been the closest I've come to getting the quality of sleep before my back was injured. The first night I slept on it was wonderful, no tossing and turning to get comfortable. 30+ days later, it's still a great night's sleep, I believe I need to try the King size for more neck support(I bought the Queen)...not a bad problem to have, lol. It may not be a fit for everyone, it's been a pretty good one for me though, a solid 4.5/5 stars.",
