                "reviewText": "I've been testing this out for pillows in a rental. I love that they are bug-proof and waterproof and easy to wash. I thought it might help save me from washing pillows so often that don't have removable covers, and so many people fly in after a hotel stay I thought bugproofing would be nice. The first time I washed and dried them the outside was dry then I found out the inside was still wet so had to dry them some more. They held up well in the washer and dryer. They do a feel a bit plasticy but not as bad as a hospital-type plastic would be. They are too long for my King-sized pillows, so I have this extra plastic at the end I have to deal with I haven't figured out yet. I haven't personally slept on a pillow with these yet. But they it seemed okay to sleep on. This is the first time I've tried something like this so I'm not sure what to compare it to, but they do seem to be of good quality and they are easy to wash and dry and add lots of protection. I might try other brands to see what's out there, but if you have longer King pillows these might work for you.",

My husband saw I bought these \"for the kids\" and said he would never be able to sleep on a waterproof pillowcase because of the noise and would be to hot. Welp, he's been sleeping with the pillowcase for over a month and had no idea. I don't have the heart to tell him yet.They are not loud. They don't retain heat incase you sleep hot and are worried about that. They don't make any loud rustling noise and I love the zip closure! They wash and dry well. No odd smell. Highly recommend.",
