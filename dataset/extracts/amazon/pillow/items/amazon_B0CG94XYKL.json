                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 pillows from this merchant.They arrived on time and well packaged. Vacuum sealed. Sealed separately at that..In fact, they were so well packaged, I could have chosen to just use one and put the other away for some time in the future.My first impression was how soft the material was, both front and back. The stitching was excellent. I saw no missing stitches, pulled thread or any areas that the front and back were not tightly sewn.The lack of any odor was nice! Sometimes , unfortunately, I have received items that were vacuumed sealed, only to find they sealed in the awful order of the product.Not so in this case. Here are MY Pros;The price. I bought 2 pillows and paid less than I would have paid for just 1 pillow of lesser quality elsewhere.Softness-The material was super soft to touch.QualityExcellent quality. It supported my head the same amount regardless of where I lay my head.Con\u2019s.The only con I have , with these pillow\u2019s, is that they are a bit too firm for my particular needs and comfort.I have osteoarthritis of my spine so I need my pillow\u2019s to be more on the \u201csaggy\u201d side.I gave them to my adult children, a male and female. They both thought they were very comfortable.I how this helps !",
