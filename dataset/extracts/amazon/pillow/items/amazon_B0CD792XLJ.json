I usually like my pillow firm and I had other pillows that compressed, and I had to adjust in the middle of the night. This pillow doesn't have those issues, which is very helpful for my night's sleep.",

I can finally sleep through the night. It keeps my back, shoulder and head aligned as I sleep on my side. It has good support for my arm and knees.I placed the pillow on a bed and let it rest for 48 hours before I used it. It didn\u2019t smell at all from the beginning and the pillow became heavier as it rested. I like the extra bag of filling and assume I\u2019ll add it in the future due to settling.I would have rated it a 5 if a pillow case was included. I put one king and one queen size case on either end with an overlap and it seems to work ok.",
