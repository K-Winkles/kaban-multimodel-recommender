                "reviewText": "First off, I will say the quality of the neck pillow was very nice, and the included bag was a great bonus.It does a decent job of supporting your head, however I didn't find it to be very comfortable after 20 or so minutes.The filling used is fairly dense and hard, and for those that might have a thicker neck it sort of feels like it's trying choke you a bit. I was hoping for something a bit softer.Overall it was not for me, but I could see someone with a thinner neck, or someone that requires a bit firmer neck pillow enjoying this. As I said the quality was very good, and pricing wasn't bad either.",
