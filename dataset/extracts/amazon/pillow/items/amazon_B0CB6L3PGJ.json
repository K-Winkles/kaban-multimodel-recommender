I didn't go for the full five stars because the material is somewhat thin, I can see the pattern on the pillow through the pillowcase. Also, the pillowcase has two sliders on the zipper. I'm not sure why, but I feel the bulk and harshness of those sliders could possibly poke into your face or neck at some point. Hope this helps somebody make a decision.",

                "reviewText": "I'm glad this came in a pack of two because the first one's zipper broke as I tried to put it on. I only had one pillow to cover and thought at least I'd have a replacement if the first one wore out. I had just taken it out of the bag! The color and softness, though, are worth it. Overall, not bad for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This product is very nice. It is high quality nice zippers. The problem is it smells like marijuana. This would not be the manufacturer\u2019s fault. They were either smoking weed in the delivery truck, which would be my guess, or in the warehouse. It smells very disgusting. Amazon had no place in my delivery complaint for this issue, so I am voicing it here. People who smoke weed go around smelling like skunks and everyone is supposed to just ignore it. Now products coming into my home smell like this and I am very disgusted. Amazon, get your act together and drug screen your employees, especially those who are driving while under the influence of drugs.",
