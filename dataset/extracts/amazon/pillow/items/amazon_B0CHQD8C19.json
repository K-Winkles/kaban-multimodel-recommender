Viewing the photos in the product description, they seemed like they would fit in my living room perfectly.My disappointment is due to my failure to zoom in on the pictures, limitations in photographs, and a low quality image to begin with.The blues in the print are much warmer than they look in the product description. The medium blue leans toward a teal. I tried to capture the color temperature with my iPhone, but none of the pictures I took revealed the true color temperature. This may work in your favor if you wanted pillows that lean toward the warmer color scale.While the pillow covers look good at a distance, the extremely pixelated pattern was driving my wife and me nuts. My pic shows the pixelation (which can also be clearly seen if you zoom in on the pics in the product description, which I failed to do).",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quality At A Bargain Price!",
                "reviewText": "Reviewed Item: Eshabear 2 Piece Pillow CoversRetail Price: $9.98Percentage Off: 0%My Purchase Price: $0.00Purchase Date: 12/13/23Review Date: 01/15/24You're buying a great bargain if you opt for purchasing the same Eshabear 2 Piece Pillow Covers I did. At $4.99 each, I feel this is a bargain price coupled with the quality of the pillowcases.These are SO well made for the family that has kids that love to rough house, these covers can take whatever the kids can dish out!This material they refer to as linen. However, the linen I have encountered isn't nearly as thick. Interestingly enough, there isn't a tab sewn inside the pillowcase covers with care directions or the type of material they are made of. This is something we expect here in the United States, and I would think anything manufactured in China (which they are), would know this. This material \"looks\" like a 28 point cross stitch fabric with the pattern printed on it. Again, this is a thick fabric and I liken it more to a light but very durable canvas.The zippers run super smooth. To test them, I opened and closed each pillowcase about 20 times. They ran smooth each time.My pillows from that Waldo big box store work just fine in the Eshabear 2 Piece Pillow Covers.PRO TIP: I wash pillowcases prior to using them. I turn them inside out, and have them go in cold water on gentle cycle for 30 minutes with a bit of detergent and fabric softener. I then hang them to air dry. These take longer to air dry than most of my other covers, as they are significantly thicker and the inside has a second layer that is similar to a very thick \"stitch witchery\" feel. Those that sew will understand that material. However for those that don't it is a layer of thin material that is white which not only prevents colors from showing through but helps reinforce finer and thinner fabrics. Why they used this baffles me as it really wasn't necessary in the design due to the durability of the fabric. However, extra time I'd going to necessary to allow the pillowcase covers to dry just because they are significantly thicker. This will be a real plus for those that have kids that will rough house with them.I noticed no color bleeding but they still feel like a cloth canvas and they smell as fresh as my laundry does.As I previously stated, the zippers work just fine for me. Since I have the zippers from my insert and the pillowcase together, it is easy to add additional fiberfill. Areas I may not be able to reach I can use a ruler to help maneuver the fiberfill where I need it to go.On a side note, one of the most annoying things I see when reading descriptions is misspellings and words that run together. This company is one of the worst violators of this crime. If you are going to portray quality, it begins with with the listing. There are many companies that have lost actual sales from me by not caring about how they list their items, as I just couldn't handle reading the run on words, misspellings, improper grammar, etc.Amazon only lists what what sellers write, and they don't correct listing just as they won't correct my review errors.I only rate based on the product itself, not on the listing so the company lucked out there.Due to the quality of the Eshabear 2 Piece Pillow Covers I am rating them five out of five stars.Full Disclosure: This review is based on my personal and unbiased opinion. The item reviewed was gifted to me in exchange for my personal and unbiased opinion through the Amazon Vine Customer program. I also try to always provide you with one of my tips or tricks to to help make installations or usage of the product easier for you.If I notice any issues other than those already mentioned, I make every attempt to update my reviews to provide readers with the most accurate information. Whenever Amazon forwards me questions about products I have knowledge about, I do my absolute best to answer all questions as thoroughly as possible.",

                "reviewText": "These pillow covers generally seem well made. The zipper almost completely hidden in the seam and I did not find any obvious flaws in the construction. The zipper opens and closes easily.My main quibble is with the fabric itself. It feels strangely plasticky and when I look inside the pillow cover, the back side of the fabric is similar to Tyvek. It's not a fabric I would want to rest my head on.If you would prefer to use these pillows as purely decorative and not to be used as cushions in any way, then I'm sure they would hold up fine.",
