One to keep it warm or one to keep it cool. I haven\u2019t tried the warm one yet, but so far the cooler pillow case does its job and doesn\u2019t get hot in the middle of the night. My neck would bother me when I used to sleep, but the first night I used this pillow I could tell a huge difference. The second night I knew for sure it was the pillow that made me wake up with no neck pain. Slept great through the night. Very comfy too!! Completely recommend!",
