                "reviewText": "I was skeptical but have been going through pillows for decades never finding consistency or one brand/style to stick with. The department store pillows don\u2019t last long and are inconsistent. This pillow was, for me, taking a chance on something ugly and potentially uncomfortable. However, after about two weeks of use, I\u2019m still happy with it. Two months from now, \u00bfqui\u00e9n sabe?It\u2019s a tad ugly as mentioned but a standard pillow case fits on it with no loss of functionality. That helps.It has a bit of a chemical smell at first, like maybe formaldehyde (but not sure; is that stuff still used in making foam?), but that goes away quickly.Someone mentioned that the arm slots are useless. I found that to be true for side and back sleeping but less so for stomach sleeping.The pillow only works if you keep your head in the center, in the hollow. If you\u2019re sleeping with someone this makes it harder to snuggle up to them.",

My new dog chewed it and I nearly cried. Slept on a regular pillow for two nights and couldn't get any rest, I was so uncomfortable. I just bought this replacement and slept like a baby last night. So grateful to have this again!",

                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews I didn't know what to expect, but I didn't need to \"get used\" to it at all, slept great from the first night. Great neck support and comfort, the only downside is that the material gets quite hot so I don't recommend this for the summer unless you're one of those people who don't sweat. It's also a good thing that unlike other listings, this one doesn't advertise the pillow being used to sleep face-down, because the \"hollow\" center isn't really hollow, it's just a dip for your head to go, if you try to sleep face down on the memory foam you will be smothered.The little lips or slits on the sides (I don't know what to call them) are useless though, they're not long enough to hold or trap your arms in any way so they eventually just fall off.",

I just wish the area made in where I assume your arms could go were a little wider. Pillow is not small is medium size. I would like it just a little bit wider.",
