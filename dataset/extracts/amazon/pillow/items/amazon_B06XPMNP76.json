                "reviewText": "I have to start out lying on my stomach in order to fall asleep, and I probably sleep about 75% of the time on my stomach (otherwise, on my back). I also sleep towards the bottom edge of the pillow, not directly over the top and center. This all means that 99.9% of pillows are too thick and poofy, and I often feel like it closes in around my face. I tried a pillow based on TV ads, but this so-called perfect pillow for everyone was the same. I ended up opening a seam and removing about half of the pieces of foam inside. It still was not comfortable and most nights I shifted a lot to try to get it just right before I could fall asleep.A few days ago, I decided to try searching for a thin pillow specific to stomach sleepers. I saw this pillow, and that it came in king size at a thin 2.2 inch thickness (forgetting the exact size of the thinnest as I type this review). It arrived yesterday, 1 day ahead of schedule(!), and I was impressed by how soft the cover was, and how soft and thin the pillow was. There was NO odor at all when I pulled it out of the product box. Last night I put my regular pillow case on it, and as soon as I put my head down, I sighed at how AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE it was! NO fat poofy suffocating pillow, and NOT hard and uncomfortable. It was slightly squishy in a soft comfortable way (like a gel cloud under my head). It was the perfect height for stomach-sleeping! And during the night, when I flipped onto my back, it was really comfortable and soft on the back of my head. No discomfort at all in that position either. I FINALLY found my perfect pillow!",

                "reviewText": "When I first purchased the Bluewave Bedding Ultra Slim Gel Memory Foam Pillow for Stomach and Back Sleepers, I have to admit it didn't make the best impression, and it sat on my bed for a while untouched. However, after a few months, I decided to give it another try, and I'm so glad I did. Now, it has become an essential part of my nightly routine.What initially stood out to me is the slim and flat design of the pillow. It's perfect for someone like me who alternates between sleeping on my back and side. The thickness is just right to provide support without feeling too lofty. I appreciate that it doesn't put unnecessary pressure on my neck, allowing for a more comfortable and restful sleep.The size of the pillow is just right for me, and I find it especially great for back and side sleeping positions. It strikes the perfect balance between being plush enough for comfort and slim enough to maintain proper alignment.",

                "reviewText": "I have slept sooo soo good with this new pillow. I personally like a thin pillow for support. This pillow is amazing and the extra length and weight make it so that it stays on my bed all night and i dont push it off during sleep. Like a air cushion or cloud you face and head just gently nestles into it and its marshmellowy and soft i absolutly love it. it holds its shape. the quality is proffesional. the foam insert is very well made and so is the soft bedding like cover it comes with. High quality definetly worth the price. The only thing to consider when switching to a foam pillow is heat transfer. you will expirience clogged ears because during the night the cotton and air flow is not wicking moisture from your ears. ever wonder why and old pillow has some darkish stainingin various spots? thats ear wax and sweat. regular pillows aid in regulating temperature more evenly than a thicker foam pillow. its not entirely a deal breaker or a serious issue. but it takes some getting used to.last but not least DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR OLD PILLOW! wait, you will need it for three days as you let this completly air out. it comes with a very strong chemical scent. you need to let it air out on all sides away from other fabrics. i recommend putting it on a clean floor away from daily traffic and flip it occasionally. it takes about 48 hours or sometimes a little more to fully air out. placing it near ventilated areas or fans can help speed up the process. Do not let this stop you from buying and trying this out. it is well worth it. A flatter pillow is more natural on your neck and spine. if you sleep on your back or stomach. If your a side sleeper than you need a thicker pillow. your posture should be a straight line.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5'4, 110lbs. I'm small. Positively petite. Finding a proper pillow as a back sleeper has become an ongoing quest for literally my whole life. Every single other pillow Ive come across in my three decades of existence have been ridiculously tall and neck breaking. This pillow looked right up my alley. The hyper was more comfortable initially but due to my neck issues, my left ear would end up going numb during sleep, which was painful. If I wasn't a broken person, the hyper would be perfect. The ultra slim ended up being the Goldilocks pillow for me.UPDATE: initially, I received a pillow that made the rounds with other people before being sold to me. Bluewave has clarified that this is on Amazon. I had an issue regarding firmness of the replacement pillow I swapped out, as it caused my ear to go numb, it was so firm. This seemed to be unnaturally firm according to Bluewave, and they have gone above and beyond to get me promptly taken care of. They said they would check for a softer pillow.If you are of short stature like myself, or are looking for a slim pillow, I believe there isn't a better pillow on the market for the price. Any shortcoming I experienced have been remedied by a company that truly cares about their product. And that counts for a lot, especially nowadays.UPDATE 2: Never heard back from them with regards to a softer pillow.",
