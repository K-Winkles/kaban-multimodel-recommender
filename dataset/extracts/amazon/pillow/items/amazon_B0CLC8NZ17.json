The instructions told you how to shake/fluff them out, so that you can get the maximum comfort from these pillows. I was a bit concerned however, about how fluffy and comfortable these pillows would be, after taking them out of the vacuum sealed pkg and shaking them out.Again, I did follow the directions and I fluffed and shook the pillows out accordingly. These bamboo pillows are soft and pretty comfortable. I suppose I was hoping they would be just a tad bit thicker (or more plush)? My husband seems to love them.Overall, these Bamboo pillows are rather comfortable. They are not that thick and plush (if that is what you are into, like me)...however, they ARE soft and comfy...nevertheless. I would recommend these pillows to others.",

                "reviewText": "These arrived packed as compact as possible with a vacuum sealed bag. Upon opening, I followed the instructions and sat them aside, allowing these pillows to breathe and expand before fluffing them. Immediately, my cat, Kitty Purry, found them and sprawled out across one of them. I watched her sleep snugly for an hour before it was time for me to go to bed. In a desperate attempt to get her to move on her own will, I poured treats into a bowl, being intentionally loud. See, Kitty Purry is food motivated and often rushes ahead of me whenever I leave the room in attempts to get treats. This is testament number 1 to the comfort of this pillow. The hearty pour of treats ding ding dinged in the bowl, and yet Kitty Purry continue to sleep undisturbed. Tired, and aware of cat rules, I busted out the big move and began to sweetly pet her. When she opened her eyes and realized that it was me, her person of 7 years, and not my fianc\u00e9, she stood up with an attitude and went to her treats. The pillow was now mine for the taking. I ran upstairs, my pillow in tow, to find my fianc\u00e9 half asleep on the other. He didn't even bother to put a pillow case on it! That is testament number 2. I grabbed 2 cases, put them on, and laid down. \"Awwwww this is like sleeping on a cloud\" is all I could hear him mumble as I drifted off to sleep. Upon waking, the pillow was still fluffy, still comfy, and has that lulling affect that we all need. My neck doesn't hurt and I know I slept deeply. Testament number 3. If you want a comfortable night's sleep or to gift a comfortable night's sleep to a loved one, order this pillow set now. It is squishy, but not week, holds shape, but is not hard. It is also very large, so you could potentially allow your fur friend to crawl up next to your head without sacrificing space that your head needs.",

                "reviewText": "I am pretty picky about pillows, so I was attracted to these for a number of reasons.First, they're washable. I have put them in both the washer and the dryer. If you go that route, make sure you have a larger size washer, preferably with no center agitator. Mine fluffed up so big in the wash that they rubbed against the top the whole time which was really hard on the fabric and they were hard to get out. In a larger washer, that would not be a problem at all.They are adjustable firmness. You can open the zipper and remove or add filling as you like. This is so valuable as pillows are such a personal preference. I know the \"just right\" amount of height and firmness is different for everyone, and when buying pillows online it's hard to know what you're really getting. I especially like the smaller grain soft filling inside these. They don't get head dents as much as other chunkier memory foam fillings I've had where you have to redistribute the filling every night. I don't have to do that with these.They are gusseted for side sleepers. No extra scrunching needed for that good sideways comfort. And if they feel too thick for you, just unzip and remove some of the stuffing.They are standard size and fit in a standard pillowcase. If you really want an extra layer of clean, you can get a zippered pillowcase liner to put on first as another barrier before you have to wash the pillows. But like I said, they're pretty easy to wash anyway (even though the instructions in the package said to wash them every 2-3 years).Hope this was helpful!",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this pillow. I can never find pillows that I like. They are either too hard (memory foam), too soft, or too fluffy. Upon receiving these, I had even higher hopes. They come vacuum sealed and puff up very fast. You can instantly tell that these are high quality materials. They are fluffy and soft to the touch. After giving them 24-48 hours to reach their full fluffability, I tried to sleep on it. It had my head at such an extreme angle due to having way too much filling. I think I saw that these are customizable and I can take some filling out but I just haven't had the time to concern myself with it yet. I instantly went and bought another pillow (which isn't working out either so this is clearly a ME problem). Another day another pillow thats uncomfortable. Will update review if I decide to remove filling and it performs better.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these for my son who complained about my pillows being too firm lol. I gave him two of my pillows when he started sleeping in his own bed, but he didn't sleep well. But these were perfect for him. They're super fluffy too. To be honest, I like them myself. If I was a fluffy pillow person, I would get more. They have good bounce back too. I haven't had to wash them yet, so when I do, I'll update my review. But my son sleeps very soundly every night, now. Also, it doesn't take much to fluff these pillows up in the morning when I'm making his bed. I've already recommended these pillows to a few of my friends who love fluffy pillows, and also to my friends with children \ud83d\udc95",
