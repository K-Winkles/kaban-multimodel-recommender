They come very well packed and will grow as you take them off their original package to become firm yet fluffy. The construction is solid, the stems are professionally sewed, the material is comfortable and this felt like a quality item. She has been sleeping on those for a few weeks now and reporting a better sleep and a good support. For the low price-point, this is a great value and would be perfect for a guest bed.",

It took me a little to get used to them (I also want to point out that I sleep with 2 pillows) , like finding my \"spot\" so to speak but when I did. You don't want to get up cuz ur so comfortable. I did as the directions said as to fluff them up after taking out of the vacuum seal & wait a few days until you use them in order for the pillows to max out to their potential. I did fluff them up throughout those days as well. They are great for the price! They are not the cheapest but not the most expensive either. They seem to be well made with a nice colored lining around them. I would recommend them.",

Instead of these. I bet they'd have been fluffier. But! they are soft. And we're vaccum packed so I'm sure they will fluff up. But still, you can't add more depth to the filling. So when you lay your head on them they aren't fluffy or supportive at all it just sinks. I guess you get what you pay for.",

Everyone is different especially when it comes to comfort but these pillows were truly soft and what I have been looking for after many, many pillows. I immediately ordered a king set (to use as a body pillow). I previously used down pillows but became allergic and I couldn't find a pillow that matched the softness and comfort I needed. The other ones said they were soft but I found them too firm. These look plush and full but so cloud soft when I lay my head down. I love these pillows!",

It increasingly got so bad that I couldn\u2019t lift one arm above my head. Ended up having physio and $700 later on physio the pain and stiffness was just the same. Traced back when this started and wondered if it was my pillow. Swapped my pillows out for these ones and bingo!!!!! After two weeks I\u2019m completely pain free!!!!! These are such soft but with a bit of firmness, easy to adjust around any positions you sleep in and very difficult to get up from in the mornings - so comfy. Best pillow purchase! Go for it! And remember if ever you have new unexplained pain in any part of your body, always trace back to what was newly introduced or changed in your routine. It could be that simple.",
