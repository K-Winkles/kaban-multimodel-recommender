It\u2019s perfect for those who love window seats and want a pillow they can squish into any shape to lie against the window. The material is soft and not hot like many of the microfiber ones, and it doesn\u2019t squeak like some of the inflatable ones. The best part is that I can use the same pillow for hotels as well so it\u2019s the best multipurpose pillow for all my work travel needs.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been having neck pain and tension headaches in the base of my skull for a couple of months now, and my chiropractor suggested I upgrade my pillow to something more supportive. I tried a variety of different pillows (even the viral one on TikTok), and nothing worked until I found this one! I love that it\u2019s not only memory foam (so it\u2019s supportive), but that you can customize how fluffy or flat you want it by taking out the stuffing. I will say, there\u2019s a LOT of stuffing\u2026I could make a whole other pillow out of what I removed from mine -but better too much than too little! This pillow has helped relieve my tension headaches and neck pain at night, and I\u2019m finally able to sleep well again. You can easily mold it to the shape you need, it\u2019s supportive, and its height and fluffiness is customizable. Plus it\u2019s very comfortable!",

                "reviewText": "These pillows are pretty comfortable and have some decent adjustment with the bag of fill. I did toss ours in the dryer as recommended for a few minutes which does seem to get them to puff up a bit. Ours came with two bags of the extra fill, but there was no writing of any kind of the bags. The biggest disappointment was that the bags don\u2019t have even a cheap zipper or even Velcro closure. So you have to cut them open and then there\u2019s no real way to close the bag of loose fill. Annoying. Some of the fill pieces did have some harder sides to them so I\u2019m not sure how these are manufactured. On the positive side we ended up using less than one of the fill bags, at least for now, to adjust the thickness of our pillows. I honestly can\u2019t imagine anyone having to stuff an entire bag of the fill into one of these as I added maybe 1/3 of a bag and it\u2019s pretty full. My wife only added a couple handfuls to hers just to get it a little more thick. So far we both like sleeping with them. I wish they were more of a cooling pillow but it maybe cuts down on heat a tad. It\u2019s hard to really say. At least they don\u2019t seem to get very warm so that\u2019s a plus. For the price I\u2019d buy them again, especially for a set of two, as long as they hold up well over time.***UPDATE*** (11/11/23)So I figured I\u2019d update my review after using these a while. We still like the pillows and haven\u2019t had an issues with them falling apart or anything like that. I mostly wanted to touch on my previews comments about the included additional fillings. While we only used a little at first we have added fill over time. Twice in fact. Between the two pillows we have used one bag of the fill and a little of the second at this point. So it\u2019s definitely nice to have it. I guess some of the fill in the pillows just gets naturally compressed with repeated use. They\u2019re still very full but that\u2019s how we like them. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll need to add anymore of the fill or not. It\u2019s still annoying that the extra fill bags have no type of closure whatsoever so we have to keep them in a plastic shopping bag. To be clear the pillows haven\u2019t pancaked or anything. They\u2019re still very thick, but if you purchase them don\u2019t toss the fill away as you may want it later even if they come perfect for you at the start.",

                "reviewText": "Received this set, popped them into dryer on low and they fluffed up. No odor detected before or after.Husband likes this pillow and is sleeping better.He did not make any adjustments to the amount of fill.I have been using and had to remove more than 1/3 (so far), to adjust for my comfort. It is a much cooler sleep with this pillow as compared to my down pillow.There was no bag included for the removed filling, (or extra filling), Not an issue as I used a bag I had on hand.Set is well made, the ability to adjust the fill for comfort is much better than the solid foam pillows we had tried before.",
