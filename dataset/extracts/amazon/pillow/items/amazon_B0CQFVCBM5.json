This is a great pillow, it cradles your head and supports your neck while you sleep. True as advertised, there was no noxious smell when it came out of the bag and after it reinflated it has held its shape well so far. I would like the pillow to be a little thicker though, but that is just personal preference. This pillow is also great for travel as it is smaller than a standard pillow.",

I used this the last three nights that having it contoured from the beginning makes it immediately comfortable. Over the course of the night, I find it to have a little less cervical support, but still to be quite comfortable. I'm happy to have obtained this one, but I'm not throwing away my previous. In part because I am aware that chair cushions of this nature often don't retain the same level of support six months later. Time will tell with this one, but right now, I'm enjoying it throughout the night.",

The different angles help in getting just that right position.I was a big fan of this one, it arrived A-OK and didn't stink. Some new memory foam pillows have a strong chemical stink out of the bag but this one was OK. She LOVES the comfort on this one, it has just the right neck notch (which can also be used between knees for side sleepers) and it's comfy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This pillow is actually pretty amazing. I think it could stand to be a little thicker, maybe at least another inch and a half on it's thickest side, then adjust the slope for their formula or whatever, but it's still great nonetheless.The material has that nice spring-back firmness that's not too weak where you just crush the material every time... no, you bend it, it bends to you, and supports. I laid on it for just a few minutes and felt myself really wanting to shut my eyes and fall all the way asleep! My neck felt great and supported, too.All-in-all, I would recommend this for anyone who has resting issues like me. I would also gift this for someone.",

                "reviewText": "The jiaao Contour Memory Foam Pillow promises ergonomic support for various sleeping positions. Upon arrival, I appreciated that it didn\u2019t have the strong odor you often get with memory foam and that it quickly expanded to its full size, thanks to its non-vacuum-sealed packaging.The pillow is exceptionally soft and feels comfortable initially. However, I found it to be too thin for my preference, especially when sleeping on my side. My head felt too low, causing discomfort in my neck. I usually sleep with multiple thin pillows, and while this one alone isn\u2019t sufficient, stacking it with another makes it too high. It's a bit of a Goldilocks situation \u2013 the pillow is either too low or too high, but never just right for me. My daughter has already laid claim to it and says it suits her fine - if you have broad shoulders and are a side sleeper this may not be the pillow for you. As a product however I think it is high quality and will likely be great for most users.",
