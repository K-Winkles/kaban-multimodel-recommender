                "reviewText": "I haven't tried any other pregnancy pillow, but everyone I talked to highly recommended this one and I am VERY happy with it! The first day I got it I was 19 weeks and had started to get uncomfortable starting at about 16 weeks. When I first laid down I wondered why I had never used a pregnancy pillow in general before!Pros:- Padding amount is great! Fluffy and thick enough to be comfortable without being hard- Size is good for me (not sure how hubby feels) it takes up about half our full/queen bed as long as I've got it pulled to me.- I love my regular pillow and was hesitant that the pillow part wouldn't be comfortable, but it is! My head stays comfortable and it is the right balance between propping my head up and being squishy. I like squishier pillows.- I haven't tried a \"C\" shape pillow, but I like the \"U\" shape to get support on both my back and my legs. It is easy to move the side away to get up to go to the bathroom.- I've had it for 11 weeks now and it is still in good shape like when I bought it! Hasn't lost fluffyness.- It is washable! There is also a handy zipper at the top of the head part (on the actual pillow under the fabric cover) where you can access to fluff. So even if it does lose fluffyness or if you don't like what it is currently at, you can add more or take some out!- It has a good amount of weight on it, it is sturdy!- Comfortable for many sleep positions and sitting up also!- My dogs like laying in it as well, which can also be a con...you pick ;)- I'm 5'2\" and I personally like where the curves in the pillow are at.Cons:- I always sleep with one arm under my pillow....turning onto the other side in the middle of the night is a pain and I usually wake up. I do think since I'm pregnant I'd be waking up to roll over anyway, but sometimes if I'm laying too close to the pillow (where my shoulder is under the head pillow part) then I definitely have to wake up to roll.- I'm constantly having to pull the sides closer to my body, the part at my back usually scoots away from me at night, so when I reposition I have to pull it closer. The positive of the ability for space between the sides is that I can easily move one side to get off the bed and have enough space.- Taking off the fabric to wash it was akin to taking off skinny jeans for another person who isn't helping you. It is in the wash now, but I imagine putting it back on will be about the same experience. I may make dear husband do it for me...Basically a slightly more painful process to putting on a pillowcase on a regular pillow, it is to be expected.- It doesn't support under the bump. It's really good to cuddle with, but my bump is still next to or under the pillow and not on top of it, so I'm not getting support that way. I'm still comfortable, but if that is important you might want to get this and a wedge or something to support the bump. I haven't felt like I needed the wedge because it doesn't bother me (and I didn't want to bother with switching the wedge every time I rolled over) but I bought the pillow because I had started tucking the comforter under my bump to support it, so I was bummed that I can't get the pillow under the bump. It may work well for someone who is carrying different than I am, but hasn't worked for me. BTW this is how it is shown in the pictures, maybe I just had unrealistic expectations?I think the Cons are probably the same cons that every U shaped pillow would have and aren't specific to this brand. I would keep those in mind when deciding between a U or C. I really like having support on both sides, so I'm glad I went with the U shape!",

                "reviewText": "I'm currently 20 weeks pregnant, and I've been using this pregnancy pillow for about a month now. I can honestly say that it's been a lifesaver.I used to have terrible back pain at night, but since I started using this pillow, my back pain has completely disappeared. The pillow provides excellent support for my back and neck, and it helps me to sleep in a more comfortable position.I also love how big and enveloping the pillow is. It's the perfect size for a pregnant woman, and it provides plenty of support for my belly, legs, and arms.The fabric on the pillow is also incredibly soft and comfortable. It feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud.Overall, I highly recommend this pregnancy pillow to any pregnant woman who is looking for a good night's sleep. It's made a world of difference for me, and I'm sure it will for you too.(Cons - can be too big for some people)",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for my hubby, who typically has to have around 3 to 4 king size pillows propping him up in various areas (under the knee, behind the lower back, under his bad shoulder, and behind his head of course) to sleep comfortably at night. I thought this might be a one and done but still do the same job. He is also a hot sleeper so I got the cool touch pillow cover (gray, kind of a satiny feel) and it\u2019s wonderfully cool when it\u2019s very warm in our room at night due to our wood stove heating the house. He seems to really like this pillow, he sleeps very soundly and doesn\u2019t toss and turn as much as he used to when he had to re-position tons of pillows as he rolled to his side or back through the night. I like the fact that it has a zip off cover and also access to the inside with a zipper under that, so over time as the filling settles or separates, you can add more or re-stuff altogether if you like. The only downside is it\u2019s hard to snuggle up close to him now because this pillow is large and fluffy but that\u2019s okay. He works hard for our family and it makes me feel good knowing he is sleeping soundly, he deserves it. \ud83d\ude0a",

I have a Queen size bed and it's ok for us, it takes half of the bed so my husband still has his space. Also, as I work work from home I can put it in the couch so my back is good and also I have space for my laptop or tablet. A very good investment, that I plan to keep using after the baby is born.",

At 30 weeks, regular pillows propping me up didn't cut it anymore and I was waking up with a sore back every morning, hence why I purchased this. The first two nights I used this pillow, it was VERY uncomfortable! I felt like I wasn't using it right because my arm that's shoved underneath the pillow would lose circulation, I woke up sweating, and the ear pressing on the pillow would be sore. I thought I made a mistake with my purchase!! SO I went back to the instructions and it said if the pillow is too firm, to remove some stuffing. I went and removed three shopping bags worth of stuffing and NOW I sleep on it like a baby! I can barely get out of bed in the morning because it's too comfortable! And ZERO sore backs in the morning! :) So just a friendly reminder to take out some stuffing if its too firm, the difference is night and day!",
