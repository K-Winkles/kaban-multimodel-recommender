They are great for laying on my back to watch TV and they are great for stomach sleepers like me durning the night. I put Norwex pillowcases on them and they are so smooth! My husband isn't sure he's in love with them quite yet but myself and the kids love these. My 11 year old is begging me to buy them for his bed now. My teenager also tried to steal mine often. I have bad allergies and hav no problem with these at all.",

Some people claimed they are good for sham fillers but I think they are much too slim for that. I plan to use them in my guest room but not for my everyday pillows. I like that they are machine washable but I do not have a \u201cfluff\u201d cycle on my dryer so I am not able to \u201cfluff\u201d them as the instructions suggest. They are a great price for 2.",
