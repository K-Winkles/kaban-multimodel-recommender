                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t have much meat on me so plane flights or long car rides are often very painful to be sitting that long so I like to deflate this a little and sit on it like a cushion, it does not deflate with my weight at all, and is very comfortable. I also like to buy the cheapest flights I can find so they end up not having headrests or any room to lean over and nap so having this to hold my head up while I sleep is a huge help so I don\u2019t have a really sore neck when I wake up. It\u2019s also decently compact when in the bag, and blows up with 1-3 breaths, deflates super quick and easy too. Great product, highly recommend",

I bought one a few months ago and instantly fell in love with it, because it is made of a velvety comfortable material, and it collapses into a size that fits into my bag easily. It also comes with a bag that protects it while it is in my bag. I accidentally left mine on a plane and I instantly ordered a replacement and one for every member of my family for our recent trip to Asia. They all loved the product and slept well on the plane. I have in the past bought foam neck pillows at the airport for as much as $35 that are not collapsible and which therefore get disposed of. This product is more comfortable! I was surprised at how easy it was to inflate. Very few puffs are required to completely inflate it.",

Worth a try is the best I can offer.",

                "reviewText": "Deflateable for easy storage -- this is key. You don't have to hang it on your bag and drag it around the airport only to put your head on it later. You don't have to wear it through the airport like some unfashionable garment. I have yet to successfully jam it back into it's original bag, so I just keep it loose in my carry-on, which makes it easier for me to access when needed anyway. It inflates to whatever firmness or softness I want and it holds the air. The little valve cover isn't mounted well (just uses a snap-on plastic ring) so on mine fell off on the plane and I was luck to find it bc otherwise (a) the valve where you place your mouth gets dirty, and (b) without the secondary seal there may be some slight leakage over along trips. The cover is soft, plush, and very comfortable. If you sweat in hot weather the cover remains comfortable and is removable for washing (though I have not yet tried this, I suspect hand washing to avoid shrinkage may be needed). The matching color ear plugs are a nice touch but compared to other foam earplugs I've used the foam on the ones I got with my pillow is too firm to insert well into the ear so they don't seal out the noise as well as similar plugs. The eye shades are great. I never thought I would need them until I tried them. The eye cup shape that keeps the mask from hitting your eyelashes is a small but important comfort feature when you are trying to sleep. I have travelled with the product from North to South America on a total of 15 flights lasting up to 8 or 12 hours. My dozen or so travel companions are always jealous of this product compared to whatever they have. I would buy again and will give for gifts.",

                "reviewText": "I went on a 30 day backpacking trip to Japan recently, so I needed a neck pillow for the 12+ hours I would be traveling in the plane, but light enough and small enough to backpack with and not add too much unnecessary weight to my backpack.I could have gotten a better one and thrown it out at the airport upon arrival, but I didn't want to and I was backpacking in a foreign country so I wasn't sure I could get one to fix my size and I wasn't in one place long enough to order one off amazon.The nice thing about this one is it's an air bladder inside and a felt like material outside. so it's comfortable and feels good. you can adjust how soft or firm it is easily by pushing on the valve and letting air out or blowing into it. The material can get a little hot if it stays in one place for too long, but this was easily remedied but either taking it off for a min or moving it around. it only took a couple seconds to inflate and was easy to do so. I usually inflated it just about make and then once I was sat in my seat I would put it on and adjust the firmness using my finger to let air out until it fell right. the clips were a nice touch I didn't worry about it falling off it I got up from my seat or moved around a bunch, they also acted like a nice fidget toy.Because I was backpacking and would only end up using this during my plane rides I need something lightweight enough that I could carry it around the entire trip and not add any unnecessary weight. the pillow plus the bag weighted 181 grams, so it was perfect. It was also small so i would shove into what ever corner I could find in my backpack. I also could have used as an extra pillow while backpacking but I never did. This is never going to be as comfortable as a nice memory foam or bead one, but it did the job.",
