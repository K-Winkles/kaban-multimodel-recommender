                "reviewText": "I got this set of Miulee olive green pillow covers because I knew they would look great with my leather sofa and I felt like the product photos were really sharp and I could imagine what they would look and feel like in person. I can confirm this is very much the case. The color and texture are very true to the photos. The phrasing makes them sound like they'd be a bit softer and more plush, but they are still a comfortable fabric. The texture adds a coziness to the look and I really like these overall.Regarding quality, these seem really well made. The zippers do, in fact, match the fabric very well and are sewn in a way where they tuck into the seam and make them nearly invisible. The fabric feels very durable and the seams look to be nice and strong. I washed these before use and they seem like they'll hold up to long term use and occasional washing with no problem at all.Overall I think these are a good value and quality for the money. I am happy I got these and am sure these will be in my rotation for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "These boucle pillows were a nice find. You can\u2019t go wrong with a texture that works with so many other fabrics. The fabric is pretty soft for a polyester. I ordered the beige and it\u2019s exactly what I expected. The hidden zipper works great which can be an issue with some pillows with thicker material. I\u2019m pretty happy with them and think that they are a great value for the price.",

I actually mistakingly ordered the wrong color, ordering khaki instead of an off white/cream color, but that mistake worked out perfectly. I have a charcoal colored couch, with some black and white woven covers, along with some rust colored pillows, and the khaki pulled the looked together flawlessly! They are a thick material, and very soft to the touch. The zipper and all the seams are durable, and it brought the perfect look I was going for! In love!",

                "reviewText": "The old pillow covers we had were too small for the 12x20 pillows we have (we called them the sausage pillows because they were stuffed in there so tight). These are a much better fit--neither tight nor loose. The fabric is surprisingly soft but still heavy enough to feel substantial. The color of the Light Brown is hideous in person (only my opinion, especially as for how it goes with my decor), but it is what I ordered and I think that is really the only complaint I have about them.",

I am very happy with them!",
