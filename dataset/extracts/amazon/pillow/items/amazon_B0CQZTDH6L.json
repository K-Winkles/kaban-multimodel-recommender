                "reviewText": "I've used this pillow for a few days now, and I have really enjoyed its comfort and support. I sleep on my side and back interchangeably, and have noticed it definitely feels a lot better for side sleeping personally. Maybe I just haven't gotten used to it, but I will use this pillow mainly for side sleeping, as the cradle arms provide excellent support for my neck. I wake up with neck pain sometimes, and since using this pillow the pain has gone away. I love how the pillow adjusts to your head shape, and provides exceptional support for your neck and spinal alignment. I highly recommend this pillow if you wake up with cervical pain, or would just like more comfort or support for your head and neck during sleep. Amazing product!",

                "reviewText": "Decided to try something new with my pillow and ended up getting this one. I think this worked the best for stomach sleepers. The depression in the middle is perfect for head and neck support, and I love the channels on both sides for your arms. Side sleeping still had good neck support, but couldn\u2019t quite figure out my bottom arm in the side channel, so just tucked it under my chin. Back sleeping was also good and pillow provided great neck support on my back.The soft outer cover comes off for easy washing. The packaging talked about there being a chemical smell that would go away after pillow sat out for a couple days, but I didn\u2019t notice any smell straight from package.Overall very pleased with purchase.",
