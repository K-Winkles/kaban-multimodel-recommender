                "reviewText": "This pillow has not only improved my sleep quality but also alleviated some long-standing neck pain. This pillow is specifically designed to support the natural curvature of the neck. This design is great for those who, like me, have struggled with neck discomfort. It cradles the neck and head in the perfect position, providing optimal spinal alignment. The memory foam in this pillow is incredibly comfortable. It contours to the shape of my head and neck, offering a custom and luxurious sleeping experience. It's neither too firm nor too soft, striking the perfect balance for a good night's sleep. I've been dealing with neck pain for a while, and this pillow has made a noticeable difference. I wake up feeling refreshed and with significantly reduced neck stiffness and soreness. It's as though the pillow is actively working to alleviate my discomfort. I think most of my neck pain is from all the tension from sitting at a desk all day, but sleep is so important and I feel this pillow has helped me get a good night's sleep. The materials used are hypoallergenic and breathable, which is a plus for anyone with allergies or sensitivities. I appreciate the breathability of the pillow, as it keeps me cool and comfortable throughout the night. I'm going through menopause, so being cool at night is another plus!! The pillow's quality and durability are evident. It has maintained its shape and support even after extended use. This means I can enjoy its benefits for a long time without concerns about it losing its effectiveness. The most important aspect is that it has significantly improved the quality of my sleep. I fall asleep faster, wake up less frequently during the night, and feel more rested in the morning. Highly recommended.",

It arrived well-packed, folded in half, clean and no weird smells. It's sold as a remedy for snoring, designed primarily for side sleepers (but decent enough for back sleepers), which so far it has delivered. Have been using it for more than a week now, and it didn't lose the sturdiness.The trapezoid is higher on one side than the other, so you can kinda adjust the neck level that's the most comfortable for you. I like the lower longer side up when reading and shorter side up when sleeping, but that's just me.The pillow came with an instruction manual, which felt a bit unnecessary.",
