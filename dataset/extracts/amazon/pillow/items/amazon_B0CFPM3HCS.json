This isn't a huge pillow which I appreciate as my face doesn't if I lay on my side, as you would with a large size pillow. The memory foam is perfect on this pillow and price is very fair for the quality. Lots more expensive pillows out there that are not nearly this nice.",

I\u2019m a really sensitive.I would put near cracked window( winter here) overnight\u2026AM throw in dryer on AIR fluff for 5 min with a few bath towels on top of it\u2026..NO HEAT!Repeat alternating sides\u2026.each day.You might think this is a lot to do but the difference from other pillows I\u2019ve tried is the odor comes out of this particular one. I will take this when I travel for sure.And I\u2019ll probably get another one to leave at relatives house for myself.Bonus two difference thicknesses sides.",

I\u2019m a side sleeper and need to sleep with my spine straight because of some neck problems I\u2019ve been having. I am able to get the perfect position of my head using this pillow and since I\u2019ve started using it, I no longer have tingling in my arm when I try to sleep. I love this pillow. I\u2019m sure it is very user dependent, but I think this pillow would work for a lot of people. It isn\u2019t firm and contoured, it is more soft, like memory foam. It compresses a bit when I lay on it to fit well into the space between my neck and the bed. My hunt for the perfect pillow is over!",

                "reviewText": "I have been searching a long time for the right pillow. I really like the shape, contour, and softness of this foam pillow. I wouldn't consider this a memory foam because true memory foam have a slow release because foam conforms to your neck/body. In contrast, regular foam bounce back quickly and therefore does not hug to each curve of your neck. However, I do like their foam over others because it is not so dense. I wanted to love this pillow but it does not conform to my petite profile. The cervical loft area has 3 or 4 round raised button-like design which makes it uncomfortable. Not sure why they designed it this way. It may be more comfortable without out.I would recommend you try it because pillows are very personal and subjective. It is a great quality too.",
