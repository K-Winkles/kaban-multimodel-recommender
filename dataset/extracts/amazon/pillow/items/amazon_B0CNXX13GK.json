                "reviewText": "I had to remove some of the fill, probably 5 handfuls, because I sleep on my back a lot and it was a little too high for me. I took it out of the middle so that there is a \"groove\" down the center where my head rests while still having neck support. It has helped a lot with me waking up with my mouth bone dry due to open-mouth breathing and probably snoring a little. I'm super fussy about a pillow so I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this one. I had been using another brand for years that had a seam actually sewn down the middle to give your neck support while not tilting your head too far forward, and it's been hard finding a good pillow. I'm happy with this one!",

                "reviewText": "We recently spent a few days at my sister-in-laws house. I loved the pillows she had on the bed. I order one for myself on the trip home. When my grandson and I opened the package, we immediately detected a chocolate \u201cscratch & sniff\u201d like scent. I figured it was the packaging, so put a pillow case on the pillow and placed it on a bed with freshly washed bedding. When I went to sleep that night, I again detected the chocolate scent. Several days later, the scent continues to be detectable. The smell is not awful but it does make me a bit concerned that there could be something unhealthy in the pillow. My sister-in-law\u2019s pillows did not have a detectable odor. Besides the chocolate scent mystery, I am very happy with the pillow. I have not, as yet, added any of the extra filling that was included. The pillow is not referred to as the chocolate pillow.",

I may decide to take out some of the filling as I continue to test it, but so far no more neck and shoulder pain for me.Couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this purchase!!!Also, this pillow gets THICK if you do add the filling, just an FYI",

The quality is really good on these and I love being able to customize the filling to suit my sleep comfort (side sleeper) and they don\u2019t go flat like cheaper pillows do. I experimented with the inner gel filling until I got the perfect fill amount. These are holding up nicely after about 8 mos+-. The only thing to keep in mind is the banding will show through if you use thin pillow cases as seen in my pix. Other than that these are awesome.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am VERY satisfied with this pillow. For several years, I\u2019ve been using feather pillows because I enjoy being able to fluff them up when needed. Lately, my feather pillows have been bothering me. They become flat quickly and when I fluff them up they become so big that it kinks my neck. My husband has always complained about the pillows too, so we\u2019ve been on a pillow hunt, to try and replace all of the ones we own in the house. \u2705WHAT I LIKE: \u25aa\ufe0fI\u2019ve been using the pillow for just shy of one month. It is VERY comfortable and has kept its shape. I haven\u2019t had to wake up to fluff it up in the middle of the night. \u25aa\ufe0fThis pillow came with an extra bag of stuffing. I ended up using all of it. I didn't think it was enough, but so far I am extremely happy with the comfort and firmness. \u25aa\ufe0fI was VERY happy to see that the box the pillow came in had 3 tamper-proof seals. I ALWAYS look out for this when ordering personal-use items. The pillow was tightly wrapped and compressed within the box as well. \u25aa\ufe0fAt first, I was a bit disappointed I couldn\u2019t order this pillow in a Queen size, but once I received the King, I realized what a blessing it was to have the bigger size. Regardless of your bed size, having a king-size pillow is so nice because you can also use it as a body pillow. Or if you\u2019re like me, build a barricading wall to keep your partner on their side of the bed!\ud83d\ude1d \u25aa\ufe0fSince this pillow is going right into our faces, I did a full-on sniff test. Seems strange to do that right? But, you\u2019d be shocked to know that another pillow we ordered smelled really bad...I\u2019m talking musty wet dog kinda smell with a hint of foam and rotting meat. \ud83e\udd22 This pillow smells NORMAL, clean, and like foam. \u25aa\ufe0fThe foam is also uniform and clean looking. It doesn't look like it was swept off of a factory floor like the other pillow we ordered which had off-white foam, with bits of random blue and orange foam, and sometimes what looked like melted/flat dirty foam. You\u2019ll be so happy to know this is CLEAN (as seen in my video). \u274cWHAT I DON\u2019T LIKE: \u25aa\ufe0fThere isn\u2019t much to complain about with this pillow, other than I now have to buy king-sized pillowcases. Lol! I was lucky to have one on hand - no idea why I had it, so I guess this pillow was meant to be! \ud83e\udd8bOVERALL:I\u2019m so happy to have the king-sized pillow for my queen bed! When you have two king pillows, it eliminates the gap you would get between 2 queen pillows. It also looks better! My future orders for new pillows will be sizing up to a king. If you\u2019re on the hunt for the perfect pillow with medium firmness, this is the pillow for you. This pillow springs back to its shape. No longer do I wake up with a kinked neck! That\u2019s a HUGE plus for me!",

                "reviewTitle": "Decent shredded memory foam pillow, quite fluffy, somewhat insufficient head/neck support",
                "reviewText": "This is a reasonably decent pillow filled with shredded memory foam (as opposed to a semi-shredded larger chunks or solid block of foam in mattresses) that's well made for the most part and while it does perform better than most others I've come across, it's still somewhat insufficient for my needs with respect to head/neck support. However, I do understand that's a personal preference more than anything so you may or may not be fine with the support it provides.\u2261 Physical buildThe physical build quality appears just fine, similar to most other pillows at this price range nowadays and there isn't anything fancy about this particular one either. The zipper for the outer cover isn't as smooth as I'd like it to be but that's far from a deal breaker. It has an inner pillow filled with shredded memory foam and simulated down material (i.e. down-alt, whatever it's made of).The inner top and bottom sides have pockets of sorts filed with down-alternative fiber-fill (again, whatever that is) whereas it's depicted as being all-around inside which isn't exactly true. While the craftsmanship of the pillow as a whole isn't anything spectacular, it's also by no means low quality or even poor. Again, it's on par (or perhaps even slightly better) with most others I've come across at this price range with some minor issues (zipper being one).\u2261 Bit of extra shredded foamA small bag of shredded memory foam is included and I used 'em all to provide a firmer support for my head/neck but you may or may not need 'em. I just wanna mention that it looks like a big bag but in fact it's just slightly more than a handful (at most 2 handfuls).\u2261 PerformanceSo how does it perform? Well, it barely supports my head/neck the way I want it to be with the extra foam provided. However, if I have to choose, I'd say it's insufficient for my needs. With that being said, it's better than MOST others out there at this price point. It is quite fluffy which I'm not a big fan of but perhaps that's what you like or prefer. Btw, I sleep on my sides as well as on my back.I personally don't care for fluffiness where it seems large and firm but collapses and deflates down to a sheet (bit of exaggeration here but you know what I meant) where it simply lacks adequate firmness to support my head and neck. This is similar but MUCH LESS so in comparison to most others. I should stress it again that I personally like and prefer firmer pillows where it can provide adequate support for my head and neck where I need.Of course, I don't want a rock pillow either. It's tricky business, I know. I'd say if you prefer medium-firm, then perhaps this is something you'd prefer. The extra shredded foam does help to adjust the 'firmness' I believe, it's just not enough to my liking.\u2261 ValueAll things considered, this s a reasonably decent shredded memory foam pillow that's medium-firm with a small bag of extra foam so adjustment (within reason) can be made to suit your needs. The overall quality is decent and the fabric is relatively soft and comfortable; however, this might not be sufficient for someone who are looking for firm pillows because it uses shredded memory foam instead of larger chunks or even entire solid blocks to support the weight of your head.It's reasonably priced at $60 for what it provides and its overall build quality as well as the amount of memory foam provided (which is the single most important factor when choosing a high quality foam pillow).",

                "reviewText": "So far my experience with this pillow has been positive and I haven\u2019t experienced any issues related to its quality or construction. Usually, I sleep on a King sized down-filled pillow but I find that I much prefer this adjustable memory foam pillow to it because it doesn't swallow my head. I like that the adjustable filling doesn\u2019t smell like down sometimes does and I also appreciate that no feathers puncture through the pillowcase to poke me.The pillow arrived adequately filled and decently firm but I tried some extra filling to see how I\u2019d like it if were firmer. I found that adding extra filling increased the height of the pillow which was great for my side sleeping but quite uncomfortable and not supportive for my back sleeping. Ultimately, I settled for less firmness which was a compromise in support between my two most frequent sleeping positions. I ended up removing the additional filling from the pillow to lower its height and I found that the pillow was still comfortable but I do occasionally like to double stack an additional pillow over it when I turn to my side to sleep. This pillow is well-sewn and constructed and I really like that I am able to adjust the support provided by the pillow as needed. I find the pillowcase and filling material to be breathable and soft against my skin and I would choose this pillow again over my down pillow!",

I've been using this pillow exclusively for 2 weeks and found the comfort to be superior to my existing king sized pillows - it feels more of a feather pillow, rather than memory foam, sort of like a blend between both, which is my preference. I simply love the fact that you can adjust the sizing!",
