                "reviewText": "I was hoping for a satisfactory pillow as the ones I was using before these were awful and flat and just looked sad. After reading reviews of these pillows I was thinking \u201ceh ok they\u2019re probably nothing special\u201d. And when I first took them out of the package, they were nothing special. No firmness, lumpy, too soft. So I put them in the dryer for an hour to fluff them as some of the reviews said and that worked some magic. They came out very fluffy, but still very little support and no substantial firmness. It wasn\u2019t until I put them into their zip-up pillow protectors that I really saw them shine. A pillow protector on these pillows makes them everything you could ever want in a pillow! They\u2019re perfectly firm and fluffy and provide good support, and they look good too. So buy them, and buy a pack of zip up pillow protectors. You\u2019re welcome!",

                "reviewText": "If your looking for a reasonably economical pillow set, look no further.Build Quality: The pillows arrive vacuum packed. I ordered 4 sets. Two of those (remember, there are 2 pillows per set) were compressed evenly to a thickness of ~1.5 in. The remaining 2 sets were less compressed and resembled footballs.Don\u2019t let the size of the compressed pillows fool you. They have some heft to them. Each 2 pillow set weighs in at around 5 lbs (~2.3 kilos). Pillow covering is nice, but thinner than expected. I couldn\u2019t determine the filling type. Judging from the amount of shipped compression I suspect it\u2019s some type of memory foam. They\u2019re also slightly larger than a standard queen pillow, though I had no problems slipping the pillowcase on.Use: A few caveats first. The directions for decompression are on the package label. Read them and heed them. Also be careful opening the package. Compression puts the thick plastic wrapping in direct contact with the pillow cover. A slip of the scissors will result in tearing the pillow\u2019s cover. Now that they\u2019re open, shake them a bit and toss them in the dryer on low heat for 15-20 minutes. Magic happens and they\u2019ll expand substantially.Now that they\u2019re uncompressed, slip a pillowcase on them and give them a try. I found them to be medium firm and comfortable. Most important to me was the absence of flattening after use.Final Thoughts: I normally get new pillows once a year and rated these highly based on one night\u2019s use. It\u2019s also the first time buying from a source other than a big box store so durability is still an open question.",

More fluffy than firm feeling.BUT that being said I still think especially with it being a two pack it\u2019s worth the money and is still a good value. Sleeping on both of them together makes the firmness a lot better. And the material itself doesn\u2019t feel bad, they feel like they\u2019ll hold up decently. All in all- for a decent deal for two decent but not perfect pillows- these will do.",

                "reviewText": "It has been years since I bought any pillows. Understandably, the filling in my pillows had lost integrity and the pillows had become sacks of loose flab. I also did not realize what pillows cost these days. Well, I needed sheets, pillows and a bath mat, so I drove to the store with the initials BB&B, figuring that was the place to buy bedroom and bathroom stuff. Wasn't very happy with the selection. Was shocked by the prices. They had some really fancy pillows at $150 a pop, some pretty nice pillows at $50 a pop and some decent pillows at $25 a pop, but the choices were pretty limited. In all honesty, I could not detect $125 worth of difference between their best pillows and their worst pillows. I decided to look on Amazon before buying anything. I found these pillows at $18 a pair. I was skeptical of the quality, because I believe that you get what you pay for. I was skeptical of the degree of support the pillows would offer, because the pillows are shipped flattened out like a pancake in a vacuum bag. I figured that they would compress again when you used them. But I figured at that price, I could use the pillows as fill material in shipping boxes if they were ill suited for bedroom use. I ordered two pair. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. When you take the pillows out of their bag, they fluff up to five or six times their volume in the bag, and they retain that volume pretty well. After fluffing my pillows manually, I put them in my dryer (set on low) to heat and fluff them further. My old pillows were in really sad shape, so maybe I am not the best judge of quality. But these pillows are a great improvement over the ones I had been using. They definitely are worth $9 apiece. I can't claim they are as good as the $50 pillows I liked, because I can't make a side-by-side comparison. But from what I can remember of how those pillows felt, these pillows are just as good. I am sure glad I did not pay $200 to replace my old pillows.Update 9 months later:I am still quite happy with these pillows. I even raised my rating from 4 stars to 5. I have added a photo that shows how they have retained their \"fluff\" after 9 months of use. I am no great connoisseur of pillows - or of wine. Maybe there are indicators of quality that I simply cannot perceive, but I would not pay $150 for a pillow, any more than I would pay $150 for a bottle of wine. In my estimation, these pillows are a great value at $9.50 apiece. I honestly don't know why anybody would pay $50 or $100 more for a pillow.",
