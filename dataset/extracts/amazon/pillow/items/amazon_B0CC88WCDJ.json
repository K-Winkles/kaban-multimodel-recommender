My head isn\u2019t getting hot while sleeping. It is firm which I like. I also like that this one can be ordered in queen size vs standard size.I can\u2019t speak for the longevity of it but as of right now, I\u2019ve been using it almost a week and it seems pretty decent. I was having lower back pain previously when I woke up every morning and realized my previous pillow was staying flat. First night I used this I had no morning lower back pain. Second night the back pain came back next morning so flipped my mattress. Now no back pain when I awake and no headaches.For the price. It\u2019s worth it in my opinion. Comes in a nice cover which I place in my pillow case anyways.Not too big and not to skinny. Just right. I sleep on the highest raise side and I\u2019m a back sleeper. Hope this helps for anyone shopping around. It did take a few hours to fully decompress",

Honestly I think a book would be more comfortable. If you are someone who like plush feeling then stay clear from this pillow.",
