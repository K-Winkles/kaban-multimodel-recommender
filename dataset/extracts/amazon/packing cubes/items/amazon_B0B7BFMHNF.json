                "reviewText": "I was concerned upon receiving these that, as a plus size person, that these packing cubes wouldn\u2019t be helpful in controlling my suitcase chaos. But do not let the initial bag size fool you- these bags hold a lot. I packed multiple plus- sized jeans & sweaters, t- shirts & leggings, & other items for seven days, & had room to spare (just make sure you fold things nicely). The bags are well- labeled with the suggested clothing to put in them, good quality, definitely kept my clothes organized all week & easy to find, & even made unpacking really quick. Highly recommend if you\u2019re going to live out of a suitcase for any amount of time & like to have some semblance of suitcase organization.",
