                "reviewText": "This was my first time traveling with eBag Packing Cubes and I will never go back to regular packing. I bought the cubes in small, medium and slim sizes (3 of each size), and that combination was perfect for a nearly two week river cruise/car trip to France. Unpacking and packing was a breeze, as I was able to leave items such as underwear, bras, socks, swimsuits, shorts, sweats and pajamas packed and just place the cubes in the hotel/stateroom drawers. I even packed one of the small cubes with an \"emergency\" change of clothes and shoes to carry in my backpack on the plane in case my suitcase got lost in transit. I love that the cubes have mesh at each end so that you can see the contents, plus the double zippers allow you to easily unzip just a portion of the cube to get to what you need, or unzip all the way to pack/unpack. The strap handle on the end is great for transporting the cubes to/from the hotel room drawers/closets. I would highly recommend these to anyone who travels on a regular basis. They are such a time saver and eliminate the frustrating mess you normally make as you dig to the bottom of your suitcase to get \"just one thing.\" With these, you just unstack and shift the cubes to get to the cube you need, remove the one item, and put the cubes back in place. Genius!",

                "reviewText": "Very happy! I ordered two sets and the six bags fit perfectly on one side of my carry-on (I measured it before ordering to be sure). I am not traveling at the moment, but did a quick test of two and could easily fit seven adult short sleeve shirts and toddler outfits in each one. I may even just pack one days worth of clothes for both of us in each one so I can just grab one daily without shuffling around in multiple bags depending how long we're in each city. I've always traveled minimally when flying internationally (usually with just a backpack) but my next flight will be to a new country with a child for the first time. I didn't want to check luggage so I'm happy I'll be able to fit all our clothes on one side of the suitcase and leave room for other necessities and items bought abroad on the other side.",

It would be extremely useful to actually have the dimensions of the product advertised so you can work out how small they actually are before buying! The cubes still pack an impressive amount into each, but I'll have to buy a different brand's larger cube for my trousers/skirts as I can barely fit one pair into one of these!",

I own larger packing cubes and found that items such as socks tended to bunch up on top of the flat laying garments, and were difficult to locate or see in the case once laid out when travelling. As these are smaller, you can organise your small items very easily. The purple is a lovely colour and they seem well made. No doubt you could use them at home in your wardrobe for accessories such as gloves or woolen hats, tights etc.",
