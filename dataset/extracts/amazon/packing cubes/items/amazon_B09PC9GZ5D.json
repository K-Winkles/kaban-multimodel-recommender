                "reviewText": "After a careful review and several previous purchases, I finally bought these bags and was so happy with them.They are well made and without defects. I love the individual designs on each bag that doNOT bleed out to the contents inside.Although the bags appear small, I was amazed at how much I could pack into each bag! You really need to be careful and weigh your luggage because you can easily pack too much causing you to be over you weigh limit.The handles on the bags were helpful lifting the bags out of the luggage. The bags did not slide around the luggage like plastic bags do, so they don\u2019t get wrinkled. They also take up less room in your luggage.I did an experiment to see if clothes got wrinkled less by folding flat vs rolling: they both did not get wrinkled using these bags.I was very impressed with how neat it kept the clothes, how compact and wrinkle-free. It made traveling so much easier!Suggestions: I wish you could order more XL or XXL size. And I wish there was a place to label what the contents are inside the bag (I guess you remember the design).I highly recommend these bags.",

I love how they fit together in a larger checked suitcase, and the compression feature is a winner. I was able to pack both casual and work clothes easily in my checked bag. They're extremely lightweight and are really durable/well made.I love the designs (National Parks) and made it so easy to pack and stay organized while away. I also liked the dirty laundry bag, too! It seems a bit expensive for packing cubes, but I thought it was totally worth the purchase. I'd highly recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "These compression cubes were a life saver during my two week trip to Italy. The variety of sizes made it easy to locate what I wanted. Besides the compression bags, there is an awesome shoe bag and waterproof bag - in case you bring a swimsuit or get wet shoes, you can throw them in the bag and roll it up to keep dirt or moisture away from your other clothing. A lifesaver!Fall means changing temperatures and these compression items helped me to pack MANY more items in my suitcase than I expected. I could pack a few sweaters more than I thought and still bring many lightweight t-shirts, shorts and skirts than I probably needed. It's always nice to have an extra shirt or two though - just for variety.Not only did these bags compress items and allow more to be packed, but it kept my skirts and dresses neatly rolled which prevented wrinkling! Not having to press dresses and skirts saved time and aggravation.The variety of sizes allowed me to organize my clothes and find them during travels. Pants and dresses went in the large rectangle, the smaller rectangles got short sleeved shirts, one got skirts, another underwear and socks, another sweaters. How did I ever pack without these?What really struck me was how organized my suitcases were throughout my trip. I could refold and replace items if they were still clean. It is so much easier to unzip a bag and find that exact shirt (which is NOT wrinkled either) than digging through a suitcase full of unfolded and disorganized clothes. I'll never forget these when I travel again!Best purchase of our trip!",

                "reviewText": "This is the fourth product that I have purchased from Tripped Travel Gear, and like the others (backpack, toiletries bag, and technology pack) the value and quality is exceptional. I have purchased other compression packs before, and I have found them to be flimsy and not durable. These are very high-quality. The material is clearly strong and durable, and they are well-constructed. I like that I can keep my clothes organized and compartmentalized so that tops, bottoms, underwear, and socks are separated into different cubes, making it easy to find what I need without rummaging through my entire suitcase. It's also so useful for keeping clean and dirty clothes separate. Overall, these travel packing cubes are a must-have for anyone who loves to travel. They're efficient, space-saving, easy to use, and versatile. I will continue to buy products from Tripped for many years to come.",
