                "reviewText": "My wife ordered a set of these without me knowing for a 10 day trip to Bora Bora. When they arrived I saw them and thought they were a waste of money.I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG!!!These have been amazing!!!! Our suitcases are neater and more compressed than they've ever been for any trip in my life. Things I like about these:*Super solid construction.*They fit ALOT of clothes in them, I mean ALOT. I pushed these things to what I would have imagined would be the limits and they took everything like a champ!!* No more packing a neat suitcase only to open it up and have all the clothes disheveled from travelling.*No more packing a neat suitcase, then open the suitcase to pull out a quick change of clothes only to dishevel all the other clothes in the process (when we left Denver it was snowing, got to Tahiti and wanted to quickly change into shorts and a t-shirt). Simply pull out a Bago cube, unzip, take clothes out that you want and zip it right back up!*Packing is EASY! Normally you'd pack a suitcase with clothes and just hope everything fits. Now you pack your Bago cubes first and then try to orient them into your suitcase. If your first orientation doesn't work, you're not having to repack everything individually, just pull the Bago cubes out and try a different orientation. This EASE allowed me to get really creative since it just took a matter of seconds to pull the cubes out and repack them differently. Ultimately I ended up just throwing my cube of clothes (yes I packed my entire 10 day trip in just one of the cubes) into my personal backpack which didn't get charged as a carry on. My carry on was then utilized to carry my snorkeling gear and lots of odds and ends....all the things I would have struggled to get in my backpack!*My wife and I put all of out tolietries in zip lock bags and then put them all in one Bago cubes. Everything was soo easy to get to!I've been writing this review while sitting on the back porch of our over the water bungalow here in Bora Bora....I'm gonna call it quits on this review but I can say I'M CONVERTED!! ALL future trips no matter how long or short will have our items packed away in Bago cubes!",

                "reviewText": "Made our 12 day trip to Greece so much easier to manage, as the suitcase was so organized. Good quality, zippers worked well, held more rolled items than I expected, wrinkling was reasonable (and I packed a week ahead), and loved the mesh so I able to see what was inside as I packed by clothing type. Next time I may pack in outfits.For our medium size suitcase, it fully cubed out with 2 large, 2 medium and 2 small cubes.The medium cube also fit very well in my small roll-on computer bag and held two skorts, four tank/t-shirts, two scarves, and one each underwear, bra and socks (had soap to hand wash) to cover in case checked luggage was lost.On the cruise, when our luggage had to be stored under the bed, placing my cubes on the closet shelves was so efficient. My spouse now wants his own set.I have bought 2 of the multi-color 5 piece sets and headed back to buy the 4 piece, so my spouse and I are ready for the next big adventure!Packing tip: Five in our group had luggage lost, but interestingly, one spouse of each couple\u2019s arrived. Pack one cube in your carry on and then split his/her cubes between two checked bags to help reduce impact of lost/late luggage!",

I organized my clothes for a 3 week trip in these. Sometimes we were somewhere with no drawers and they worked like drawers; I could just lay them out and easily find my clothes and keep everything organized. They fit my suitcase perfectly. The large ones took up half the size of the suitcase (meaning I could fit two perfectly across the bottom of the suitcase) and the small ones were a quarter of the size of suitcase so I could stack two on top of one of the larger ones and still have some extra space for some random things. So, yes, I would recommend them. They are very light and can hold quite a bit.",

Or 6 long sleeved men's polo shirts (size XXL)! These are not the style where you remove the air, but they allow everything to fit very compactly and neatly. Well made.I ordered the pink and black set and my only complaint is that the picture showed that I would get a large and medium in pink and also in black - perfect for a couple to keep their things separated. I ended up with two medium pinks and the two larges were both black. Not the end of the world, but my husband would prefer not to use the pink.",

Great for organising different clothing so packing and unpacking is so easy.I use the plastic bags for toiletries.After I trip or holiday I also have a couple of cubes just for things you always forget like plug adapters, charging cables, Mossie spray, sunscreen, sun hats etc so when packing next time I don\u2019t have to find everything. I have even written a list of what\u2019s in what cube which I leave inside so I don\u2019t have to sort through.In summary. Simple, well made and saves time, effort and expletives when packing!",
