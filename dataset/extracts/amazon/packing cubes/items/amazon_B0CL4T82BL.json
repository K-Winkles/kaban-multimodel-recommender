                "reviewText": "These travel compression packing bags feel pretty solidly made to me. The zippers zip smoothly, and my only complaint about the zippers is that both the ones to open and close the bags and the ones to expand it are the same color visually. The expansion zip track is lined with red (vs the yellow for opening and closing), but when you're reaching for a zipper it'd be nice to be able to ID which one you actually need without peering too closely.Luckily, that's an easy fix - the zipper leads are basic little cables that are loop-cinched and can be easily removed and changed with something else.They arrive all nestled Russian doll style inside the medium sized bag. I liked being shown how to store these when not in active use this way. (It's not obvious to new travelers, we all were new once to both packing for vacation and storing stuff between trips.)The little clear vinyl pockets for labeling what is in what are easy to access and don't flop around too much. I'm not sure how useful they are to me personally, as I tend to cram my stuff wherever there's space, rather than by outfit or item-type. Guess I could use them to list the contents: for example, pajamas, 3 pairs of socks, 4 t shirts, and a toothbrush lol.The large comes corded with the sort of cord you'd find on a drawstring backpack, complete with the little press button doohickeys that let you adjust the length. This is utterly useless to me as I can't stand the feel of cords on my shoulders, but I know there are plenty out there who would find this super useful as a built-in daybag for sight seeing.Problem for the rest of us is they can't be removed without cutting the cord, and they kind of get in the way when packing. This is somewhat less an issue when the bag is full and you've placed it where you intend to keep it for the time being, but when moving it around to fill up or put in the suitcase it's *really* annoying and catches on things.I've had other travel cubes over the years but these seem like a good bargain at about $20 for the set - but I've never had high end ones so I don't know if there's some level of quality I'm missing out on. These are better than some of the ones I've bought in the past, so I'm content.My one complaint applies to all such travel kits - there's nothing specifically made to pack bras. As it is, I pack them flat with socks and random clothing to support the cups so they're not ruined during travel, but in an otherwise neat suitcase, the orphaned make-do stack of bras never fails to irk me.",

                "reviewText": "We were a bit skeptical of these, but got them since we had a cruise vacation coming up. My wife packed everything she needed for a week in one carryon bag using these things! We were both pretty amazed. She would lay one on the bed, then roll up clothes and stuff them in so they were overflowing the top. Then she'd zip the first zipper, which somewhat compressed them, but not fully. Then we'd smash it down even more and force the second zipper to close, which would compress the contents even further. Then she had these nice compressed bags to drop into the carryon bag. Without a doubt these allowed her to carry MUCH more than she otherwise would have been able to fit in the suitcase.They are very strong and the zippers worked very well. We now just keep them in our suitcases so any time we go on a trip, they will be there when we pack.",

Surprisingly, this set of packing cubes come up on top in several ways:1. Weight \u2014 they're much lighter weight. These are the ones I will be reaching for if I'm concerned about airline baggage weight limitations.2. Design details \u2014 I like that the zippers are color coordinated, so you know which one opens the cube and which one is for compression. Small detail but it's a nice convenience to have. I like also that each back has a handle.3. Variety \u2014 Compared to the premium packing cubes, this set wins in terms of variety / multi-functionality. I like that a shoe bag is included, and that one of the packing cubes doubles as a backpack, and I can see myself using it as a bag to carry laundry or gym gear in while I'm traveling, saving myself the hassle of packing an extra bag for that.Overall, these packing cubes work well and I'd recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "My wife got a set of packing \u201ccubes\u201d recently. I liked the idea and wanted to try some. This set has some advantages over hers. These are all expandable and have a holder for luggage tags (aside from the one for shoes, which her set doesn\u2019t include). Also, one of these has cords so that it may be used as a daypack. The one thing I like better about her set is that they have mesh windows so that you can see what\u2019s inside. These are opaque. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, maybe the slots I thought were for luggage tags could be used to label what\u2019s inside each bag. I think I\u2019ll try that.I did a test run, planning for a 5 day trip. In the smallest cube I packed 5 pairs of socks and underwear. In the largest container: 2 pairs of slacks, jeans, and PJ pants. Next size down: 5 long sleeve shirts. Shoe container: hiking boots (I was impressed that they fit). I was left with one medium size, so I put a jacket in it, but it could be for toiletries or any miscellaneous electronics, etc. I could have fit more, but this is the length of trip I\u2019m most likely to take, and I wanted to try compressing them. I was able to close all the gaskets with the red zippers. Then, I put everything in my overhead-size hiking backpack. It was a little tight, but they all fit. The exterior pockets of my bag were empty, so I could have carried a bit more. For what it\u2019s worth, the cubes with these clothes weighed 14.4 lbs (not counting the backpack itself).The cubes were easy to empty and compress back down to one bag. I really like this set and recommend it.",
