So I decided to buy these packing cubes in an effort to be more organized. I have only used them a few times so I cant speak to its durability. But so far its been great! It comes with many different sizes and I like it comes with additional bags like the laundry and toiletry bags. If your in the market for packing cubes I would recommend these.",

I have never used packing cubes before, but decided to try it because I am a classic over-packer. All ten of the cubes and other bags fold flat and fit neatly into the zippered toiletries bag. I was able to fit four pairs of jeans and two pairs of shorts in one bag. I placed 12 pair of panties, four bras, two slips, two pair of pajamas, and two sleep shirts in another bag. I placed six shirts in another and still had room! The bags are durable and have a mesh covering so you can see what's inside. They really helped me organize my suitcase. Only time will tell how long they last as I am not a frequent traveler. But I was very impressed with this packing cube set.",

Packing and unpacking was a breeze...I could not believe how I managed with a disarray of contents in my suitcase these past years. Everything now stays nice and neat coming and going. I chose this brand and am very happy with my choice. This brand is constructed very well and an excellent price (1/2 the price as TV). I purchased the purple color that matched my luggage. I highly recommend this brand!",

If you do not have packing pods, I would recommend these.",
