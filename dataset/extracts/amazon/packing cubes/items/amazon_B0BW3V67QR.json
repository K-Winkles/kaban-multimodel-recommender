They helped my clothes stay organized & created a LITTLE bit of room in my backpack. No packing cube is going to make significant space so don\u2019t think they\u2019re a big space saver. They did compress the corners a little bit with minimum bulge to the middle. Zippers didn\u2019t get stuck which is a huge plus. Just make sure you run your finger in front of it when compressing & you\u2019ll have no issues. I took along one medium & two small cubes in a 32L backpack. I could\u2019ve easily fit two more small ones if I didn\u2019t have shoes in my bag. Overall, great quality for the price & perfect for backpackers.",
