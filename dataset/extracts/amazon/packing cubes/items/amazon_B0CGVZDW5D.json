                "reviewText": "I love-love-love packing cubes. I own many of them, and wanted more. I\u2019ve been happy with other Gorilla Grip products in the past (mostly cabinet lining and bathroom products) so when I saw they made cubes as well I jumped on it. As expected, these are excellent.If you\u2019re new to the packing-cube game, they are a great way to keep your clothes organized and wrinkle-free when packing/traveling. I\u2019m writing about the 6 piece set, which comes with 4 actual cubes of different sizes. Each size serves a different function. For example, my husband takes the biggest one for his long sleeve button downs.You fold all your shirts and place them in the cube. That will keep them from moving around in your suitcase and minimizes wrinkling. Then there\u2019s the added bonus of being able to compress all your clothing with the secondary zipper of the cube. The first zipper closes the cube and the second one kind of brings the two outer sides towards each other effectively compressing the cube (hence the name!)When you get to your destination, it\u2019s so easy to just grab what you need because you\u2019ll know what cube they are in. I\u2019ve become so cubed-obsessed that I bought these as a permanent \u201cto go\u201d bag. I have a few pieces of every essential clothing that I could need for a weekend, and just keep them in a weekender bag.The 6 piece also comes with a bag for shoes and a laundry bag. Super convenient because I tend to forget laundry bags when I travel!Buy with confidence, these are excellent.My star ratings explained:5 stars = Exceptional. I recommend to friends.4 stars = Exceeded expectations.3 stars = Met expectations. Satisfied with purchase but not overwhelmed.2 stars = Failed to meet expectations but usable.1 star = Avoid.",

                "reviewText": "I have wondered about these packing cubes for years and finally decided to take a look. Gorilla Grips is a favorite brand, so I was confident the cubes would be a well made product. Traditionally I have more or less made my own packing cubes by using very large 2.5 gallon ziplock bags, about the average size of a clothing cube. In my ready to go one night suitcase, I had one ziplock bag with houseshoes/nightgown/robe and another with a change of clothes for both myself and my husband. I transferred these to the two largest cubes; they fit easily and in fact I was able to add another item or two to the biggest cube.I didn't discover the cubes had two zippers until later. I packed with the compression zipper already closed! But it worked, I just had to tug harder to get the first zipper around the bags. But it would have been much easier had I realized you unzip the compression zipper first.The cubes appeal to my desire for tidiness, but I did lose the clear windows of the ziplock bags. So I'm faced with two bags without a hint of what is in each of them. I could fix that by making laminated labels. I might even buy another color and separate my clothes from my husbands. One day of night clothes and underwear and outerwear would definitely fit in one bag. Of course for longer trips you'd probably want to separate the outerwear and underwear and nightgowns into different bags. I used the 3rd smaller cube for some of my costmetics - no real compression there.Did they save room over the ziplocks? I'm not sure, probably at least a little. Were they neater, more pleasing? Definitely. And for sure easier to open and dress out of than ziplocks!I am undecided if I want to go further in the Gorilla Grips cube world. I don't travel that much. If I did, I'm pretty sure I'd also try the Gorilla grip cubes with a mesh window. That product doesn't have the compression zipper, and it is hard to tell if the compression is less. But the mesh window gives a hint of what is inside and lets the items breathe a bit. Then I'd outfit my husband and I with color coded cubes with whatever product seems to work best for us.This product is very reasonably priced, and it's worth the small investment to enter the cube world. Another well crafted product from Gorilla Grips!",

                "reviewText": "This package of 3 compression packing cubes is exactly what I need for my upcoming Italy trip. They arrived neatly zipped up and folded into themselves, and I was a little worried they were the wrong size, but opening the package showed they were just as described, and how compact they could truly be!Each packing cube has a handle for easy carrying when full, a main zipper to open the compartment (with zipper pulls so it can be opened and closed separately from each direction), and a zipper to compress the packed cube. I like the zipper pulls on the smooth closing zippers as well. The material is lightweight, which is excellent for travel, and seems easy to clean off, yet durable. The inside seams look clean, though there were a few long threads dangling on the inside - I recommend trimming these so they don't get snagged in the zippers. I I have the light grey color, which allows me to see the clothes through the material.Now to answer - does compression really save space? See my pictures and you'll be able to tell how much it really does save. I have photos numbered 1-6:(1) These are the 14 adult size medium lightweight t-shirts into the medium sized cubed(2) I easily put in 2 stacks of 7 shirts side by side(3) It easily sipped shut, and I used my hand to show the size of the pack when closed.(4) Then I applied the compression by zipping up the compression zipper. You can see the compression works and makes the packing cube much more compact.(5) I've always rolled my shirts when I pack, so I decided to try it again. I rolled the 14 shirts, each layer fit 7 shirts just as easily as before.(6) I zipped it closed and applied compression. WOW! THIS IS THE WAY TO PACK - it's much more uniform all around and less bulgy so it will be easier to arrange in the luggage.I think this assortment of sizes is perfect as I'll be able to pack intimates in the smallest cube, shirts in the medium cube, and pants/jackets in the lighter cube. I highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to organize their packing and save space in their luggage for souvenirs!",
