I bought the small size and fit all my clothes for 2-3 months into three of them (Bag 1: 2 pairs of lightweight pants, 6 pairs of lightweight shorts, 1 skirt, 1 dress; Bag 2: about 6-7 shirts; Bag 3: 2 swimsuits, 2 sports bras, 5 pairs of underwear and 6 pairs of socks). They all fit well in my 32 liter backpack along with a liquids bag, toiletry bag, camp towel, flip flops, MacBook Air and electronics chargers. So far no complaints about the quality or durability - they seem pretty sturdy. It would be great if you could buy a set with 3 different colors, which would help more easily identify which bag had which type of items in it.",

I travel a lot and have always been a good packer but these bags just make it all so much easier, and the small size I find to be the most versatile. (The large size is way too big for most purposes). I put loose items like toiletries, cosmetics, etc in one, chargers, electronics, etc in another so they are easy to take into the hotel bath or toss into my carry on. Underwear and t-shirts can be rolled and packed into another bag--easy to pop into a drawer without unpacking. These bags are especially great for a trip with many stops when I'm forced to live out of my suitcase. Everything stays neat and organized (and unwrinkled). I can find an outfit without messing up the whole suitcase",

                "reviewText": "This was my first time traveling with eBag Packing Cubes and I will never go back to regular packing. I bought the cubes in small, medium and slim sizes (3 of each size), and that combination was perfect for a nearly two week river cruise/car trip to France. Unpacking and packing was a breeze, as I was able to leave items such as underwear, bras, socks, swimsuits, shorts, sweats and pajamas packed and just place the cubes in the hotel/stateroom drawers. I even packed one of the small cubes with an \"emergency\" change of clothes and shoes to carry in my backpack on the plane in case my suitcase got lost in transit. I love that the cubes have mesh at each end so that you can see the contents, plus the double zippers allow you to easily unzip just a portion of the cube to get to what you need, or unzip all the way to pack/unpack. The strap handle on the end is great for transporting the cubes to/from the hotel room drawers/closets. I would highly recommend these to anyone who travels on a regular basis. They are such a time saver and eliminate the frustrating mess you normally make as you dig to the bottom of your suitcase to get \"just one thing.\" With these, you just unstack and shift the cubes to get to the cube you need, remove the one item, and put the cubes back in place. Genius!",

When I bought it last week, they had gone up to $24.99, now they are back to $21.24. The small cube also increased and then decreased in price. Having said that, the product is very good. They fit perfectly into our suitcases. I've done a mock pack for both myself and my husband and I can fit everything into 6 medium cubes and 4 small cubes, so I have 2 small cubes for odds and ends. For him that means 1 outdoor jacket, 2 jeans, 2 shirts, 3 t-shirs, 2 pullovers, 6 socks, 7 jocks, 3 shorts, 2 long sleeve shirts. For me: 2 jeans, 2 shorts, 1 long pants, 2 long sleeve shirts, 4 t-shirts, 2 pullovers, 1 outdoor jacket, 3 socks, 7 nickers, 2 bras. I bought 1 medium pack and one small cube pack for me, so now I need to buy the same again in a different colour for him. The medium cube will fit the same amount as 2 small cubes. For a woman, a small cube will fit 5 t-shirts or 4 long sleeve shirts, or your underwear - 7 nickers, 3 socks, 2 bras, 1 bathers. A medium cube will fit 2 jeans, 2 long pants, 2 shorts. For a man, a small cube will fit 3 polo t-shirts. A medium cube will fit 2 jeans and one shorts. An polar fleece outdoor jacket fits into a medium cube. When packing into our suitcase I could replace two small cubes for the space of a medium cube. I bought these over the cheaper ones because of the YKK zippers and the good reviews.",
