                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to purchase packing cubes as I always felt they just took up more space and didn't really serve a purpose. I couldn't have been more wrong. I fly an average 100K-120K miles a year and never check my bags. Since doing this I have had to learn how to pack as efficient as possible. After receiving the cubes I immediately took them to test out. In a nice ziplock bag you receive one large bag, one medium bag, two small bags, one drawstring shoe bag, two toiletry bags, and one laundry bag. They are all double zippered and have a nice breathable mesh except the laundry and shoe bag. I was surprised how well everything went together and how organized I was able to stay and not have to compress my bag to close. As a reference I only use an aluminum international carry on for travel so I am not able to over pack as it just won't close like you can with zippered bags that have some stretch or have the un-zippable extra couple inches. The very first thing that makes the cubes awesome is just knowing where each of your clothing items are. Underwear and socks in one, T-shirts and sleep wear in another, Pants & button ups well you get the picture. I really like having a bag for my extra shoes so they keep any dirt away from my clothing and the laundry bag for used items on the trip or possible damp swim items. The toiletry kits are made of a thick plastic and can accommodate quite a few items. I have attached a few pictures so you can see how I was able to pack them and not over pack my bag. The second picture was with a pair of shoes, medium cube, large cube, laundry bag and both toiletry bags. The third picture was with the same, but instead of the shoes two of the small cubes stacked on top of each other. Finally the fourth and fifth picture are of the small cube with 6 pairs of socks and 6 pairs on mens briefs. As you can see from the picture the cube is not stretched and I could have put a few more of each. Overall I am extremely impressed and wish I had purchased these sooner. Lastly I don't roll my clothing so I can only image how much you could fit doing this method.",

                "reviewText": "There's something magical about packing with the cubes. Suddenly I felt I had more room in my suitcase than ever before! I packed as usual, but the separation using the cubes created more space, and I was able to add an extra outfit and my favorite UGGS to my carryon. Even then, I still had room in my bag! Love these more than I expected.",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy I ordered these. I bought 4 sets for my family. They made packing SO MUCH EASIER!! Everything felt so organized and easy to find. I think it helped fit more items too. When we got to our destination it was so easy to unpack. For the price they are I was very impressed with the quality. I was concerned the zippers would be weak but that was not the case. The cubes are lightweight and durable. I think they will last us several years. Each set came with a really nice selection of bags and sizes. The shoe bags are awesome to have too. I can\u2019t recommend these enough. I wish I bought some sooner.",

                "reviewText": "Good for organizing and helping save the \u201cchaotic\u201d space when packing. Not compression but that wasn\u2019t what I was looking for. I utilize the marie kondo method of folding and it fits a good amount of stuff in a much smaller space than just shoving stuff in the suitcase. The full set would probably be too big for just a carry on but fits well in a full size checked bag with some extra room left.",

                "reviewText": "Have used these packing cubes the last few months for me and my child. We have been talking long trips to see our family and these bags are so light weight and fit perfectly in our carryon bags. The zippers are nice and smooth and the cubes are flexible enough to just flip the top and toss into a drawer to keep all your clothes organized. The clear bags can fit so much stuff and I have had no problems going threw TSA with them. I guess I only wish the laundry bag would hold more clothes but the material doesn\u2019t allow for that. I really do love these cubes and would highly recommend to anyone. I combed threw so many of the cubes on Amazon and for the price these were the best fit by far.",

We just travelled 32 hrs from NY-lAX-AKL-CHCH (New Zealand) where we are now in Managed Isolation for two weeks. I bought these cubes to help pack specific clothing for our isolation period (literally sports gear, underwear and pjs - all easy things to wash each day in our hotel room and dry on the heated towel rail) The cubes have been fantastic. Carry a lot of items, easy to fit into our suitcases while not squishing clothes, good range of differnt sizes and i love that they zip almost fully open for easy access and packing. Wish I\u2019d bought one more set!",

There are several types included - there are ones with mesh, which I use for clean clothes. One drawstring bag that I use for dirty clothes. Two clear toiletry bags (which I haven't used). A dedicated shoe bag. And one opaque zipper bag. These make packing a breeze, and they will also revolutionize how you pack for the beach!",
