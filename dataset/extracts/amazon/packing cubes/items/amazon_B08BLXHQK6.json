                "reviewText": "These hold more than you would think - especially with organized placement or folding / rolling. I use the small to keep a change of clothes in a carryon while flying. Be careful when compressing not to catch the zipper on the fabric. Once compressed they seem very odd shaped with a big center. I just step on them and it pushes clothes slightly to make them a more standard shape. Also great for organizing in home or planning some packed clothes in advance and setting aside. Great value and you do want the varying sizes for different types of items and to play Tetris in your suitcase.",
