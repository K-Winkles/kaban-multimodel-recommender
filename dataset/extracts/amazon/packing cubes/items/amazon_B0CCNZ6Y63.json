You put your clothing in them, press down on them to push air out through the mesh openings, and zipper the sides shut so that the clothing can't re-expand. As long as you don't try to pack them too full, they work well.It's notable, though, that these are not vacuum bags. They will not compress your clothes by as much as you can compress them with a vacuum bag. If your expectations are reasonable, they'll definitely do what you want. But if you're really looking to pack your clothes as flat as possible, vacuum bags remain your best choice. These are a lot easier to use though.I'll be honest, I have my concerns about trying to use these \u2013 I'm a little afraid that they'll make it a bit too easy to over-pack my suitcase and end up going over weight limits.

Just keep in mind that less space doesn't mean less weight! No problems with the zippers. You just need to make sure you pull tight enough if you have really filled them up.",
