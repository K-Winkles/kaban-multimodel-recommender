I go to Work 2 times per week. Then after work I usually workout or connect with friends and family. I am now traveling to many different locations 5 to 7 days per week.These storage cubes are very light and airy and flexible . I use them for clothes and for accessories. They are very durable and have held up even when they were filled to capacity. The zippers are easy easy to use and glide very easily and have not gotten stuck. I also use the small cubes for makeup and the shoe bag protects my clothes when I am carrying a change of shoes regularly. The set came with a variety of sizes and shapes. I liked everything about the product.Overall I would recommend this product to to my friends, coworkers and family",

                "reviewText": "Note that these are packing cubes with no compression. So they'll keep your bags organized but won't free up space like compression cubes do. One of the cubes ripped on our first trip. It wasn't even fully packed. So quality is definitely on the very low end side. That said, for the price it's still nice to keep clothes organized when traveling and you can just toss when the cubes break.",

                "reviewText": "These are my favorite packing organisers!! Some big standout features are the mesh on the top so you can see what\u2019s on the inside easily, the number and size of bags so you can be organized for a week to 10 days and yet fit back into small storage bag, the smooth zippers, and the bags u zip on 3 sides so you can lay the flap all the way back to pack easily. Love this set!!! This is what I packed\u2026 I\u2019m larger so most people could fit more and I had extra room in most bags.Bag 1: 1 pair of jeans, 7 pair of capris/leggings, 1 swimsuit. Bag 2: 8 shirts. Bag 3: 2 light pullovers, 2 pairs of pajamas. Bag 4: a jewelry travel case. Bag 5 (actually the set storage bag but I\u2019m using it!!!): an accessories travel. Bag 6 (Shoe bag): pair of tennis shoes, pair of flip flops. Bag 7: 3 long socks 6 ankle socks, 8 underwear, 5 bras. Bag 8 (Stuff bag): sunglasses, cosmetic travel bag, Advil, charger box, Trash Pandas game, and medication case for a week. I would definitely recommend these for any traveler!!",

                "reviewText": "Great price, but you definitely get what you pay for. The zipper on the largest organizer (of the 8 pc set) had to be zipped all the way around and then unzipped in order to correct a gap in the zipper track.While packing it to use the day after receiving it, the same largest organizer developed a hole near the handle. The organizer was only half full at the time.The organizers are all paper thin. Maybe good for packing baby clothes, not suitable and reliable for even lightweight adult size clothing",
