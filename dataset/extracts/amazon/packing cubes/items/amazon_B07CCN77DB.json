They hold a lot! And then you can zip up the compression zipper so it takes up less space. We received an email from the company with tips on how to use \u2014 which was helpful. I don\u2019t think the zipper would break either way, but it made it easier to zip up the packing cube (which we had really stuffed!).I was actually EXCITED using these because they were so beautiful, high quality, and hold a lot!!",

                "reviewText": "Perhaps my expectations were not as they should be, but I thought that by purchasing \"compression\" cubes, I would actually be able to put items in the cubes and compress them down so that they took up less space in my suitcase. Not the case with these bags.I actually read all the online reviews for countless compression bags before ordering these. Not only that, but I did a search for Best Compression Packing Cubes 2023 and read three different articles, all of which highly recommended these Gonex Compression Packing Cubes. One of the reviews I read was from a lady who'd packed ten pairs of jeans in the large bag. So when I received mine I rolled up ten pairs of jeans and tried putting them in the large bag. Yes, they did fit, but they did not compress even the slightest bit. In fact, the second zipper that's supposed to \"compress\" the contents would barely zip and even after it was zipped, the bag was the same size it was originally although a slightly different shape.I will say that the bags appear to be well made. They were lightweight material yet seems to be sturdy. The zippers seemed good quality. As I mentioned, I was able to get ten pairs of rolled up jeans (size 8) in the large bag, but no space saved. These would be excellent for someone only looking to organize their suitcase, but if you truly want to compress items, I can't recommend these.",

These, being a bit narrower and smaller allowed for a better arrangement in my bag. I was able to get 4 days of clothes in 3 of the cubes. Using the largest for my shirts. skipping the next size down. 2pr jeans and 2 pr of tech pants in the next cube and undies in the smallest. Worked perfect. Might order another set to lend to greater flexibility for packing. I was a little concerned that when using compression zipper, I was going to ruin the zipper, due to the bulk of the clothes in the cube. I took my time to zip, tucking in the cube fabric and clothes so the zipper didnt bind. Would like to see the zipper a bit more reinforced, but over all product works well.",

                "reviewText": "I went backpacking across south east asia for two months and brought these along with me. These things were a life saver for organization and space conservation.The compression part is kind of a gimmick, you don't really need the second zipper to compress your clothes but it does help a bit. I found just opening the main zipper and shoving stuff in worked well enough. If you really needed a bit more compression than the second zipper is great you just have to be careful when zipping it back up for compression purposes because the zipper will get caught in the fabric and you might rip the zipper off if you're not being a little careful.I do take care of my things well, either way these are fairly cheap and still look brand new after two months of heavy usage.",
