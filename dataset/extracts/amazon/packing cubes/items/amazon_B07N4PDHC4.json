Recently I watched and became addicted to an influencer on TikTok that showed how she used compression cubes, by folding her clothes to the size of the cube. It works very well, and does minimize wrinkles especially when you compress the cube using the middle zipper This set is very light weight - a must these days for carry-on, and the zippers are smooth. The stitching seems to be strong and as I have used this set once and packed them tight, everything is holding up. I would recommend this to a friend.",

                "reviewText": "I have to travel light for work since I go from the airport to job site without being able to drop a suitcase at a hotel first. I have regular packing cubes, that worked pretty good, but these changed my packing game. I can now put everything I need, for a week, into a backpack and not have to worry about where to stash a suitcase until my work day is over.I use these, in conjunction with my regular packing cubes, for vacation travel and they work very well for that as well. I can pack for 2 weeks, in another country, in a 21 inch suitcase. Having one small suitcase makes it easier to move from airport to train station to taxi with minimal fuss.The only thing I would caution about using any packing cubes, your bag can get heavy quick.I've bought 2 sets of these compression cubes. The quality seems to be great and I have put some stress on the seams and zippers. The size works great for my clothing but I'm limited on how many button down shirts I can pack for my, over 6 foot tall, husband. I tend to use regular packing cubes for his shirts and these cubes for his T shirts, socks and underwear.",

These packing cubes made it easy to stay organized in a small space, and the pack of cubes that I got came in a variety of sizes that made it easy to pack your shirts, shorts, pants etc.in order to use the compression zip, you can\u2019t overpack the cubes. But if you pack with them properly, you are able to compress your clothes very easily. They are well made!I found that after a few days, when pulling my clothes out of the cubes they were not wrinkle free, but it didn\u2019t matter much to me since it was all mostly athletic wear. If you have a nice top or pants though, you may need to iron or take it out of the cube once you get to your destination to let the wrinkles out.",
