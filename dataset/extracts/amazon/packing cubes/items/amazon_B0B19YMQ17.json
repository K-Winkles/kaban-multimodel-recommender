                "reviewText": "It's definitely only for carry-on luggage as you would need about three sets to fill a regular suitcase. The blue color is pretty, and they do hold a pretty good amount for a carry-on organization system, but I would need more than one package for my suitcase, so I feel the price is high for what you get. It would be worth the price if they had two of each of the large and the medium but honestly it would be far better if it contained 4 large and two medium because that is what is really needed to pack an average suitcase.",
