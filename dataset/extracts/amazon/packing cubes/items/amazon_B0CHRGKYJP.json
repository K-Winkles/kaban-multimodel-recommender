                "reviewText": "First, I love these as an option for packing and traveling light. They make it very easy to organize and efficiently use the available space\u2014especially when packing a backpack or similar soft-sided bag. And they do compress very well. I packed a sweater, 2 large t-shirts, a pair of pajama pants, and a large laundry bag all in the smallest compression bag (three of the six bags in the set have the compression zippers).Once compressed, the organizer with all my clothes was smaller than my roll up toiletry bag. That was awesome, and will definitely come in handy for flying without checking bags. (It may come in handy for packing souvenirs without needing an extra bag on the return flight, if you pack without compressing on the way there.)IF I LOVE IT, WHY NOT 5 STARS?The method of compression is very manual. It took some time and effort to compress and zip, inch-by-inch. It works and the bags seem very durable, but it was harder than I thought it would be. If you have pain in your hands\u2014arthritis, carpel tunnel, etc\u2026\u2014the amount of manual effort is something to consider.But, even if you don\u2019t use the compression feature, these still save space by efficiently filling it and keep everything neatly organized. It\u2019ll also come in handy if your travel requires switching hotels, because the organizers can help so you don\u2019t have to fully unpack or dig through your bag at each stop.",

Other compression cubes I have allow the air to be pressed out a bit and have a second zipper to press the clothes tighter together. These ones are a mesh-type material so all they really do is keep the clothes contained. If that's what you are looking for these will do the job but I think the price is high for what you are getting.",

These ones are way better than my previous set though\u2014excellent value. The zippers are super smooth, they come in a variety of sizes, and they feel like quality little bags. Because there are so many sizes, I can put shoes in one, socks in one, underwear in a third, hair accessories & bracelets in the fourth, shirts or pants in the fifth, and then still have the sixth for dirty clothes. I\u2019ll be very well organized for my upcoming cruise and these will be super easy to vacuum out afterwards (I can\u2019t find a care tag to see if they\u2019re washable).As a bonus, the two bigger compression bags have handles so they\u2019ll be easy to pull out of my suitcase.
