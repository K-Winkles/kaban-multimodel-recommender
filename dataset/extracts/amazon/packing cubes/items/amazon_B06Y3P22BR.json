                "reviewText": "I have lived out of these packing cubes for the last 15 months and they have been SO GREAT! I love using these packing cubes. I love their colors and they have held up so well!! They have started to fray on the inside, the extra material that is sewn in to make the outside seemless (unimportant material in other words) and I cut them as they unravel, but I'm sure once they reached the seam they'll stop since there will be no where else for it to unravel, lol. The handles have held up great and the zippers!! I've had no problems with the zippers at all, they have held up like troopers as I have stuffed my bags full sometimes. I love the compression feature, makes it easier to get things organized before zipping everything up tight to put into my suitcase! The laundry bag is also the perfect size. At first, I thought it was going to be too big, but the people who made it clearly knew what they were doing. Including the smaller Sequoia bag is also the perfect size for my hair brush so hair doesn't get into the rest of my stuff. The smaller bags have been great for 2 pairs of shoes in one cube (uncompressed) and my extra shampoo etc in the other cube (compressed). Overall, I love these and when they eventually wear out to where I can't use them anymore, I hope to buy them again! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Our family of five (kids aged 13, 10, and 8) just returned from a 5 week European trip using these packing cubes in our carry-on backpacks, and they were truly a game-changer. They kept us all organized, and the compression feature helped to give us more space in our packs for souvenirs. We are not the easiest on our things (especially me, the dad), and these cubes still look brand new. There are no rips, tears, loose stitching, fouled zippers, etc even after 5 weeks of daily use and abuse. The laundry bags were particularly great (they pack down small, you can stuff more than you think into them, and they're a handy and discreet way to take your laundry to a laundromat (like we are in the attached picture from the south of France). We would absolutely buy these again.In addition, we're glad that we could support a small business rather than a big corporation! Customer service was helpful and friendly (and a real person!) when we contacted them (see below).Full disclosure: We did we one set of these cubes for free in exchange for an honest review, but we had already bought four sets for our trip. (We contacted them because we thought that four sets would be enough for our family but wanted to get just another laundry bag. Unfortunately, they only package the laundry bags as a part of the set, but they offered us a free set for an honest review, which was great since we ended up using the fifth set as well.)",

                "reviewText": "I never used packing cubes before until my trip to Europe in a backpack. I decided to get some and after a long research and reading dozens of reviews I settled on this one. I also borrowed some from my friend she has cheap ones from IKEA. Now this is how I feel. Using both of them I liked how this one has the compression feature, the ikea one didn\u2019t have this option.I like the fact it came with multiple sizes, this will be perfect for a carry on. I used the laundry one for my shoes.This is what I don\u2019t like about this. It is hard to just open it and get what you want. You will have to unroll everything and take it out of what you re looking for is inside the cube. When I used the ones from Ikea, I can just open it and get what I want without messing up everything and having to pack it again. If this opened up all the way I\u2019d give it 5 stars. My husband is lazy and he likes convenience and when trying to access clothes you basically have to take almost everything out to get what you want. Other than that, material is good. It light. Zippers are well made and not the cheap ones. Be careful not to over stuff so you don\u2019t rip the the stitches . I hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "BACKGROUND: I learned about Tripped by following Tim and Fin on YouTube & IG; I'm always on the lookout for my next international vacation destination, and I stumbled across their Mexico City/Dia de los Muertos video initially (I'm frequently there, in the same spot they got their makeup done, and I am planning to attend the festivities in Nov 2024). So there's an unsolicited plug for their YouTube & IG. PRODUCT REVIEW: I travel internationally on business practically every week & only take a carry-on with me, so managing my packing space is a priority, especially when visiting multiple climates. These multi-size compression cubes are great for that, as they help in really packing a lot into a small space, while also keeping everything organized. I also have some Cipway and Gonex packing cubes, and visually they look like they all came from the same manufacturer. That is neither a plus nor a minus, merely an observation. However, I have no complaints about any of them, although I appreciate the Tripped ones more because I can put a face (actually two faces, Tim and \"Fin\") behind the product. So...5-stars and keep up the good work!",
