I can't speak to the reliability as they've only been used once, but they seem to be very good quality. Very lightweight, and they hold way more than I thought they would :)",

                "reviewText": "We got (3 each) of these as a gift, pre-pandemic.Now that we are travelling again, we have found them amazingly handy travel organizers.It\u2019s one thing to unpack a suitcase into drawers when you are staying some time in a rental.But when you find yourself \u201cliving out of a suitcase\u201d these excel at making life easy.Pack Tee\u2019s etc in the large, they fit perfectly, smaller items in the mid-size and undies in the smaller.Just lift them out of your suitcase, put them on a countertop, and it is so much easier to reach larger pants, skirts beneath, then repack in the morning.We re-gifted 3 to a friend who is travelling next week, bought 6 more for our self\u2019s and recommending them to 3 more friends who are all back into travelling, booked for Portugal, Hawaii and Germany.I can\u2019t recommend a more convenient travel item.Impressed with the build quality of this product, don\u2019t know about other \u201cPacking Cube\u201d suppliers.",
