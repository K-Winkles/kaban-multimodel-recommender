Now instead of taking half my clothes out of the suitcase in order to put together an outfit and then having to refold everything to fit it back in to the suitcase, I just take out a couple of cubes, take out what I need from them and put them back in the suitcase. They are perfectly sized to fit in my suitcase too! I didn't think I would use the handles but I do. It's a nice touch. I like that they have netting on top so not only can I see in to see what's inside but I feel like it helps to keep my clothes aired out while stuck in a suitcase for a week or two. I've used them for several trips, including two international trips, and they have held up very well. I feel they are well-made and will hold up for many more trips. I just wish I could order the different sizes individually. I would love a couple more of just the small size.",

My partner has had this same set for years and his are well loved and still working perfectly.As advertised, they really help you keep your bag organized. Plenty of bags with compartments and varying sizes means you can sort your items. It comes with what I'm told is a shoe bag, but personally I use it for the really dirty laundry.The zippers feel sturdy and well made, and each cube is structured so that they retain their shape. The carrying handles are nice as well, makes it easy to pull the cubes out of your suitcase and put them somewhere like the dresser or in the closet.Fully packed cubes fill up 50-75%% of my standard 24\" Samsonite Winfield suitcase, which is perfect because the rest can be my shoes/toiletries.",
