                "reviewText": "I purchased 4 sets since we travel often with our 3 kids. These cubes are fantastic. All of the seams are reinforced and the zippers are smooth. After seeing how easy it was to organize our suit cases on a recent trip, I started using them to organize our closets at home. I was able to condense 6 36\u201d drawers worth of clothes down into 2 xl cubes, 3 medium cubes, and 3 small cubes. I will be buying more to organize the rest of our closet space.Only minor gripe is that they are relatively heavy compared to other packing cubes I\u2019ve used. However, I\u2019m pretty sure the weight is due to the extra support built into the cubes so I think it\u2019s a worthwhile trade off. Even if the products break, I will be buying more.",

I had to pack for 5 people for all 4 seasons but to condense it all to fit in a cruise stateroom. I wish I had taken a picture of them after I had packed them, but I didn't. I used these to pack all of our warm, bulky, jackets and items. These things were awesome! They held so many things and were able to compress them all down so that I was able to fit most of our warm things into 2 of these bags. Even my husband was impressed, which takes a lot. I would highly recommend these for travelling.",

I bought them for a recent trip and used one cube for me, one for my son's clothes, and one for my daughter's. It made my life SO MUCH EASIER when locating specific clothes, and saved so much space in my suitcase! Gone are the days of stacks of clothes all over the place in my case. I definitely recommend this product. I can't say much about durability yet as I've only had them a couple weeks and only used them once, but they feel durable to the touch and I anticipate using them for many years.",

I dont think they were stitches that came loose but rather ends which were sewn onto the product. It not that noticeable unless you look closely.

But I've had the opportunity to use them while traveling via plane around the USA. they fit perfectly into my standard carry-on luggage.The zippers are strong and the material has held up great so far. I've basically \"maxed\" the storage of these packing cubes out almost every time. I load up both sides of the bag completely then kneel on them the get the center zipper to compress the two sides together. It's kind of surprising how much you can fit. Pro-tip: roll up you shirts, pants, etc to maximize space.",

I haven't needed to expand them yet but it's really nice to know it has a larger capacity (and that I don't need to buy a larger bag.) I love that you really get 2 bags (because of the compression) in one (with a divider)!They are (I've bought several) bigger than I initially thought but it's worked out well for me. The fabric is durable and the zippers seemed to be of good quality. Over all, I would say it is a good quality product. I wish they were very a little cheaper because I would definitely be love to try some of the other sizes!The only draw back is I thought the tealishone was teal but it's actually green. A ugly green- not camo. But it was the cheapest and it's so useful it's still a keeper!",

The sizing seems pretty good for my 28 liter travel pack and I like the separate dirty/ clean compartments, so far, even if they do create more material bunching when not using the separate sides. I've packed a couple of different clothing travel loads in them and the zippers worked well, even around an overpacked load (will update after some more extensive use).The one really negative thing, is that these cubes arrive smelling like someones cheap purfume or an air freshener like febreeze was used on them. Either they were stored in a house or returned from a house where this scent was used or it was sprayed on them. Its strong enough that I'll be washing them to try to get it out, as I wouldn't want it transferring to my clothes. Also, the shipping time was quite a bit longer than what was stated with Prime shipping. Thats totally fine by me, but in addition to the smell, made me think worthwhile to mention it.",

                "reviewText": "I did a ton of research on compression packing cubes before I bought these. I'm very happy with them. One thing to note when buying a packing cube is that, yes, it only compresses itself maybe an inch or so, but it really does save a lot of space in your actual travel bag when you use the cubes. At first I didn't really understand this, and it seemed like maybe I wasted my money, but when I packed the exact same items in my travel bag without the cube, and then WITH the cube, I had like double the space in my bag than I did without the cube. I stuffed this thing full, two pairs of jeggings, five shirts/tops, and five pairs of underwear, two bras, five pairs of no-show socks, and three bigger/thicker pairs of socks. All zippers seem very sturdy. It also really does help to roll items when packing them in the cube. I laid the jeggings out flat, and rolled all my tops (they wouldn't all fit until I rolled them), and then I laid all my underwears out flat in the second compartment. I'll try to add pictures soon.",
