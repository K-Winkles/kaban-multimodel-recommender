The bag are so far holding true to being durable. No rips or seams coming apart when I packed my cubes tight.

                "reviewText": "The Set of Six Zoom Lite Travel Organizers comes with six different sized, lightweight, zippered bags. The bags are a made of polyester and are a combination of parachute type of material and mesh. Four of the bags have small clear plastic windows and a piece of hard stock so you can label the bags. Five bags of the bags have a reinforced webbing type handles and dual zippers. The small flat bag does not have a handle and only has a single zipper.The mesh windows on the bags allow you to see what is inside the bag with just a glance and the handles make it easy to grab and carry the bag you need. The classic black coloring goes with any luggage set. You can use these to hold delicates, shoes, toiletries, papers, sweaters, dirty clothes, etc. Being able to section out your items makes travel easy, as you can just grab what you need, rather than having to dig through your suitcase and wrinkle all of your clothing.Overall, the Set of Six Zoom Lite Travel Organizers have a high end look and feel. From the pulls on the zippers to the manufacturer tags on the bags. Plus, with six bags, there is a size for every need. Because of the quality manufacturing, they will not snag or harm your suitcases, or clothing. You may think it is silly to \"compartmentalize\" your items when you travel, but once you start, you will never travel the same way. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I currently have a fuchsia pink set of packing cubes that I use when traveling. My husband has commented that he thought packing cubes might be handy since he travels so much, but he didn\u2019t want to use mine. When I saw these Zoom Lite set of 6 packing cubes, I ordered a set in his favorite color. They arrived with 5 of the bags neatly folded packed and packed in one. Upon removing and inspecting them, the quality appears to be good. The color coordinated zippers function easily, each bag has a nice sized mesh area for ventilation and the fabric portion of the cubes are done in a fabric made of recycled bottles, so they have a somewhat slick surface which will be easy to wipe clean. The bags are various sizes, to accommodate different needs. I personally like the two largest sizes and would need more of those sizes for myself, but I can see how the smaller sizes would especially be good for men to use when packing. With their construction, I expect these to hold up well with wear, but will return to update my review if we have a problem with them. I do recommend them for their quality and the variety of colors offered, and I think my husband will enjoy having these to use.",

                "reviewText": "These are very nice packing cubes. They are well made. The nylon fabric feels durable and is a decent thickness. The mesh makes them breathable and the mesh too feels strong. I have another brand and the mesh is super delicate and if it snags it will tear easily. That is not the case with these. While mesh always has some risk of getting snagged, this is a durable, tight weave so it won't tear easily. The zippers are good quality which is awesome because this is often a weak point on many things. Stitching is good quality and the handles are attached strongly.I do wish these had more compression. The company does also sell compression style cubes. Those have double zippers and you can use the second zipper to compress the cube more tightly saving room in your luggage or a drawer where you are using these. This particular set is just a standard packing cube without that extra compression. This is still a quality set. Just note if you want more compression I would look at their other products.I also wish this came with two large or medium instead of small and xsmall cubes. I find the smaller ones less practical. They might be good to pack some electronic cords or socks or ties I suppose. But because of the mesh they aren't good for toiletries that may leak nor wet clothes. It would have been nice to have a more waterproof piece included with the set.An additional nice feature is the little label window so you can label which items you have in the cube. There are 2 little pieces of cardboard you can write on and insert for each cube with the label window. (shoe bag does not have a label). But you can also see through the mesh on these to know what you have in there.The shoe bag is long and not as wide as traditional shaped shoe bags. But it's still deep enough to fit shoes in there. They just might go sideways rather than flat. Or toe to toe creating a long shape. It will fit one or two pairs of shoes depending on your size and the type of shoes.They have a nice selection of colors available to choose from and they are made from recycled single use plastic bottle material which makes them more eco-friendly.Overall, I recommend these packing cubes because they are made well and nice looking and will keep your luggage more organized. Just keep in mind if you want more compression or different sizes you might want to look at their other products. These are quality so their other styles should be too.",
