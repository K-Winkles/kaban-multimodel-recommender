I bought two PD packing cubes and some Osprey Ultralight ones too and the difference is day and night!My favourite feature is being able to \u2018peel\u2019 open the zips! Closely followed by the compression zips and dirty laundry compartment at the back. Also love how the little handles make it easy to grab.",
