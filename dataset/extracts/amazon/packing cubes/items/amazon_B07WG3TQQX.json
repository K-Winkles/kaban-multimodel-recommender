Well I bought these packing cubes as a last resort and I\u2019m absolutely in love! Not only is everything organized but it all fits in perfectly AND I now have room for more!!! I love the design and quality of the bags. The sizes are perfect. They aren\u2019t very structured which I think is key. The fact that they are so malleable allows you to fit so much in! I\u2019m totally going to order the new leopard ones next! This is an absolute mommy must!",
