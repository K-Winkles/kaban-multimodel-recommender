But these are probably top 2 in quality of the ones we own. They work great and come in quite a few sizes. That allows for a lot of flexibility when packing.Some sets come with pictures or labels of what to put in them. But I don't always use them for their intended purpose and I end up with cube-anxiety. It sometimes feels like someone is going to jump out of the closet and give me a ticket whenever I put a different type of clothing in certain bags. :) Not really, but I do prefer to make my own decisions of what each container should be used for. If anything, just having them numbered might be nice, but I'm glad there aren't pictures of types of clothing (my kids don't like the pictures of underwear / bras on their sets).",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this set of packing cubes for my boyfriend to use during our 3-week trip to Mexico. Prior to our trip he hadn\u2019t used packing or compression cubes before and these were a game changer for his suitcase organization. The 7 piece set has a very good selection of sizes, including a shoe bag and a small pouch for medicines too. The medium and small size cubes have compression \u2013 I would have liked if the XL and L cubes had compression as well. However, with a mesh panel allowing air into the cube the compression is impacted by some extra air. The fabric, zippers and stitching all appear to be good quality and with the wear & tear of one trip, these appear to be well-crafted bags. These cubes are very nice packing cubes if you are not looking for compression cubes.",

                "reviewText": "I use these packing cubes to pack clothes and essentials for travel trips. The cubes are large and I appreciate the spacious size. The material and zippers are sturdy. I did not have any issues using the compression features with full cubes.The zippers on the regular and compression cubes stops just short of being able to open up the cubes like a book. You have to slide your clothes into cube which is can be a little difficult with bulky items or if the cube is close to full. I would prefer to be able to open the cubes up all the way to make it easier to place clothes in the cube. The mesh material allows the cloths to breath.The cosmetic bag also has the mesh material in the front. It makes it easy to see what is inside, however I am concerned about spills. I packed my essentials in plastic bags before placing them in the cosmetic bag.The shoe bag fit my large hiking boots and kept my suitcase clean. It is also nice to have a dedicated medicine bag.",

                "reviewText": "These don't quite look like what you see listed - they are VERY thin. I'm not sure that I would ever spend the time to separate all of my packing into this many containers (I knew how many were included when I ordered of course).Some of the materials that should match don't, I can't tell if it is just the color or if the material is actually slightly different.One of the bags/cubes seems like it is not cut or stitched together properly and if it was filled it would be an odd shape.Overall I'm sure that this would help some people who are overly-organized packers, but for me I would really only use one or two of the middle sizes.The first aid bag is actually completely different and appears to me to be the best quality and most useful design.",

The material is really nice, the zipper is strong and it is easy to clean.From the 4 big pieces, 2 fully open and 2 open only half way (what I did not like that much, as I like to remove those from the suitcase and put it inside the hotel dresser, to make my life easier). The piece for shoes is really nice.the on for toiletries is also well made but not very sturdy, so I opted not to use that because it might get squeezed inside the suitcase.",

                "reviewText": "Versatile set with both standard packing cubes and compression cubes. All cubes are ventilated except the medicine/first aid bag and the shoe bag. This does make identifying contents a bit easier because you can see at least a few of the packed items. I'm disappointed in the makeup bag. Not only is it ventilated, thus not spill proof, it also doesn't completely close, you can see the design in my pictures, but there are gaps at the zipper that will allow slender items like lipstick and liners to slip out. I probably won't use that bag for makeup at all, just toiletries that can't leak or spill. Interestingly, the back side of the makeup bag is waterproof material, pretty incongruous in design execution. The Shoe bag is shown with a pair of ladies size 9 sneakers in them. There is an inch or less remaining, so while it could probably hold size 10 ladies shoes, but likely not big enough for men's shoes. I do like that the shoe bag is not ventilated, so dirt or smell is less likely to escape once packed. Very light weight, which is great, since we don't want to waste valuable pounds when flying. Stitching and fabric look like they will hold up well. All in all, a decent set, with a few caveats.",
