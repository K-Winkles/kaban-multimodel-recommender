                "reviewText": "I've travelled everywhere, and I've never thought packing cubes were for me. I was wrong, and these simple packing cubes made me a believer.They arrive with no instructions, no packaging. Thankfully there's not much you need to know. They arrive completely flat, which shows that they can compress to almost nothing given the right clothes. I thought I'd prove that cubes don't work by packing a bath towel - after all, how much can a single folded towel shrink down? Turns out quite a bit! It does take a few seconds to seal the outer zipper, trying not to break it on the first day. I'd say the towel lost almost 40% of its height once fully sealed in the cube.So these cubes are under strain, the zippers are tough to work to close. I'll be watching to see if they break quickly. At first glance, I'd say the materials look basic but seem quite solid. I'm not expecting any tears in the fabric of the cubes, but I'll be watching the zippers closely. There are pull strings on each zipper that I probably won't use just to extend the life of these cubes.Now the listing says 8 pieces, which is correct. There are only 4 cubes - more than enough for my packing. There are a couple of shoe bags (no, they won't compress your shoes), and a couple of sacks with drawstrings that look perfect for laundry. The 4 cubes are different sizes - my thick bath towel went into the medium (2 of 4) size bag. I'd suggest there's enough here to fill a carry-on suitcase, but you might want another couple of cubes if packing a large checked luggage, depending on how compressible all your items are.I threw the cubes into the laundry with bed sheets, and they came out looking fine. Keep in mind the zippers probably shouldn't be in the wash with delicates. Makes me comfortable packing sweaty workout clothes in the cubes knowing I can wash the cubes alongside the clothes.I'm not sure the value of the handles attached to the cubes. But they seem well-attached if you end up carrying a cube somewhere.These aren't Instagram-worthy, high-class cubes. They are inexpensive, effective, highly useful packing cubes that I'm going to use on all my trips. I can't wait to try these in my personal item backpack to cram even more clothes into it without getting fined by the airline.",
