                "reviewText": "I fought the whole packing cube idea for a long time, thinking they couldn\u2019t possibly make THAT much difference...but I\u2019m now an official convert \ud83d\ude09Granted, I haven\u2019t done any hands-on comparison between brands, so this review is about the YAMIU 7-piece set only. They seem to be made well (strong seams, quality materials, good zippers, etc)...and compared to other brands I considered, reasonably priced. I like these well enough that I will be ordering another set for my hubby before we leave for an extended holiday next fall.That said, the WOW-factor comes with what can actually be packed in them. I am an experienced traveler and can absolutely \u201cdo\u201d minimalist, carry-on packing...but cubes take it to a new level.I use a typical, small, wheeled suitcase that can be taken aboard flights for the overhead bin (small enough for international travel). My work-wardrobe consists mostly of microfiber garments, so wrinkling is not a problem. Most often, I pack for a one week stay: 3 pants, 6 tops, a lightweight cardigan and the other necessities (undergarments, socks, bathing suit, coverup). To be sure, I am not a size 4, so these are real clothes worn by a slightly chunky, middle-aged woman \ud83d\ude06It takes a little practice to roll clothing well, but when fully packed, the largest cube takes up just over half the suitcase space. I can now pack my entire work-wardrobe in that cube (which previously filled the suitcase). This allows me to pack extra shoes or even a pair of boots...with quite a bit more room to spare!In packing the smallest cubes, I\u2019ll simply share what I packed for a non-work-related long-weekend trip:2 pair denim leggings, 1 lightweight merino wool long sweater, 1 microfiber tunic, 1 heavy(ish) button-down shirt, bathing suit, coverup and a 3 day supply of undergarments, socks and such. I used the other small cube to compress my memory foam travel pillow and blanket...and could get more into that cube, if I needed more room. The two cubes took up about 2/3rds of my standard shoulder-carry bag, so lots of room for my hanging toiletry bag and a pair of flats...plus my full length raincoat neatly packed under everything in the zippered (shoe?) bag that comes with this YAMIU set.This brings up another benefit of using cubes: ORGANIZATION!! Just for the few trips I\u2019ve taken since purchasing these cubes, I\u2019ve seen how well things can be organized. Something as simple as not having to dig through my shoulder bag to get my pillow and blanket while sitting in the ever-shrinking airline seating space \ud83d\ude16 It was so much easier to simply grab that cube! Plus, it was just as easy to repack those items to put them away.In addition, for extended trips, each cube can be packed with specific items (like all tops in one and all bottoms in another). This would be awesome for backpacking or the proverbial living out of your suitcase.All-in-all, I would recommend these packing cubes for their quality, price, and usability.",

                "reviewText": "**UPDATE**We used these for a 7 day cruise, 2 business trips and 2 long weekend road trips. I will never stop using these! They are sturdy, easy to use and keeps everything in order. They also wash well. My skeptical husband is also really impressed and uses these even for a short overnight or two night business trip. They saved us over $50.00 in luggage fees so far. They pay for themselves! Highly, highly recommend!!I have heard so many things about packing cubes, I decided to buy this set for an upcoming cruise. I was pleasantly surprised that the cubes came in a thick, plastic reusable bag with a zip top. I did a practice packing run to see how it worked using the shoe bag, large bag and one medium bag. The shoe bag seemed like a joke but I was able to pack 2 pair of sandals and a pair of flip flops. In the largest bag I was able to pack: 8 floor length maxi dresses (6 rolled on the bottom and 2 folded in thirds across the top) plus 3 cotton camisoles and a couple pairs of socks). In the small bag: 10 pairs of panties, 1 bra, 4 pairs of socks and 2 night shirts. I am plus sized (16w) and I was a little worried about being able to fit all of my clothes for a 7 day cruise in the bags. I was able to put all of these packed cubes in my carry on roller bag with room for another medium bag and room to spare on the side plus the pockets. I am SOLD on these packing cubes! It will reduce the cost of luggage fees as well as reduce the amount of luggage you have to schlep around an airport, out of your car, at the cruise port, to the hotel etc etc etc. I purchased the set in black but will get the next set in another color. The material is sturdy and lightweight. The mesh makes it easy to see what is in each cube.The zipper pulls are rubber and zipped with little effort. The clear bags are made of a thick, clear, heavy duty plastic. They will be useful for toiletries and other necessities that you need to get to right away plus helpful with TSA. They have a strong plastic odor which I hope goes away soon. I normally have to bring a large and medium suitcase for a 7 day cruise/vacation. With these cubes, I am confident that I will be able to pack everything I need for my cruise and put it all in a medium sized piece of luggage.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to try this solution for years and I almost forgot this time but I ordered these with one day to spare and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. These worked great for me. It was such a relief to be able to find what I needed in an instant instead of digging through the entire suitcase. \u201cNow where did I put that?\u201d was a thing of the past. I\u2019ve used bags for years to hold electronic device and photography cables and gear so why not clothes? On a recent 2 week trip I used one for shorts, one for shirts, one for underwear and socks and one for headwear. I actually had one left over so I just brought it along since it only weighed an ounce. It came in handy as a laundry bag. The clear bag worked great for my liquid dispensers, it holds a lot. They are flexible and vented. I wouldn\u2019t say they are going to last forever but they aren\u2019t going to just fall apart either. The double zippers move freely and smoothly. I was able to easily fit 6 pairs of shorts in one bag and 8 t-shirts into another bag, 6 pairs of socks and 6 pairs of underwear into another, everything rolled up, not folded (another packing hack). Also great for unpacking. Everything is together. I\u2019m very satisfied with these and recommend them. I used these for a vacation but I work on the road so I\u2019ll update them after a few months of using them on a daily basis.",

The shoes bag can hold up to 2 shoes if they are not bulky. My only issue was the plastic containers that hold your toiletries. They break at the seam after 1 use.",
