                "reviewText": "So I\u2019ve been using a set of three packing cubes for a few years now and it just wasn\u2019t enough. So, I purchased this set to give me more options. I think this is a great set in spite of some of the bags being smaller than described such as the shoe bag that will only hold 1 pair of shoes. But, that\u2019s all I needed it for so it\u2019s perfect for me.There is one very large bag that I will use to pack my jeans in. From my previous experience, these straps are a nice touch for securing my garments inside the cube when someone may carrying the cube by it\u2019s handle. There are also a few more cubes that are plenty large enough for my folded up tops. And, there are more cubes for undergarments and socks.The dirty clothes/wet clothes bags are too tiny for that purpose but I can always use them for another pair of shoes, a robe, or my makeup mirror. I\u2019ll be able to find lots of my own uses for these bags.The garment cubes feel flimsy and the zippers aren\u2019t the best but they will serve their purpose well and that is to keep my belongings organized. The cubes simply go from my bag to a drawer, the top of a dresser, or a desk. I do carry them flat so there is really no stress on the cubes or zippers. I leave my clothes in the cubes because they remain nicely folded and just work out of my cubes each day.I think the variety of sizes in this set is awesome and will meet all my needs! A lot of bang for your buck!",
