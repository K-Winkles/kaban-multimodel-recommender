            "What Will You Get: BAGSMART 6 set compression packing cubes includes 1 large cube, 2 medium cubes, 2 small cubes and a drawstring shoe bag. Packing organizers of different sizes are used for different packing purposes. You can separate clothes (such as jackets, pants, t-shirts and socks) into different packing cubes for easy access.",
            "Save up to 60% Space: Just like how a vacuum sealer works, the compression zipper in the middle of the packing bag helps to expel excess air, which can save you up to 60% storage space after compression. These travel packing organizer cubes keep your clothes organized and help you store and carry more in the same bag.",
            "Tear Resistant to Last: The suitcase organizer bag set is made of high-quality polyester and high-density mesh with professional stitching, which is not easy to wear and tear under frequent use or compression. The bag's zipper has been rigorously tested many times to ensure smooth operation and reduce the possibility of snagging, allowing you to open and close the packing cube with ease.",
            "Lightweight Travel Essentials: Ultralight fabric ensures your clothes will fit neatly in your luggage without adding extra weight. These travel cubes are perfect when you want to reduce weight and save space in your carry-on, suitcase, or backpack.",
            "What We Care: Every traveler has their packing style preferences, and BAGSMART provides plenty of flexibility for any type of traveler.

I already have a set of packing cubes but I wanted a 2nd set for this trip. These compression packing cubes are well made, zippers easily slide and stitching is secure. They are lightweight but still offer a good amount of compression. I would have really liked these to be larger, the large is a good size but you only get one size large in this set. The small and medium size cubes are quite small. The small and medium would work for pajamas, lingerie or toiletries but are really too small for clothing. I would have preferred 2 Large, 2 Medium & only 1 Small cube. Overall this is a good quality compression packing cube set.",

                "reviewText": "We recently took a two-week long trip over Christmas and used these compression packing cubes to help optimize our suitcases. I was skeptical at first, but these things really work to reduce the space that compressible items take up. They can't do miracles ... you're not going to get much space savings from jeans, for example, but compressible fabrics and folded/rolled item that trap air can definitely benefit.To use these you basically unzip them completely to fully expand them, carefully fold/roll your items and put them in the cube, then zip it closed. Then zip closed the expansion zipper and it will help press the items down. Very straight forward. We used these for things like socks, underwear, workout gear, that kind of thing, stuff we wouldn't mind getting a little pressed or wrinkled.We were able to pack for a solid two weeks of travel, plus a couple extra changes of clothes, and still had room left to pack a suitcase full of Christmas presents. Great product and I highly recommend them!",

However, the seams are already busting and fraying under the pressure and I haven\u2019t even left my house yet. They also smelled weird/like chemicals upon opening.

If you're on the go and need a travel sidekick, these packing cubes are the ultimate wingman.",

The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is because it is much smaller than other cubes that I own. So you may not be able to store larger clothing items. Still it is pretty handy to store underwear and socks.",

                "reviewText": "I love compression packing cubes. I got this to replace one of mine that the zipper broke and there was no way to repair it. (Back story: I couldn't find a zipper to replace it. I asked a lot of alteration shops while on my last trip if it was possible. No one had a long enough zipper to replace it.) I find compression packing cubes so much better than plastic shrink bags. Eventually, even with new shrink plastic bags, they all get some air in them; especially those that you sit on and then roll out the air. I do not have a problem with these and great space saver in my luggage",
