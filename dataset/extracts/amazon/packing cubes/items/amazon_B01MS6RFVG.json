                "reviewText": "These are nice packing cubes and I really like that this set has an extra large cube and then two large, two medium, and two small cubes. I pack my whole wardrobe when I go somewhere for a week, so it will be interesting to see how I do with these. \ud83d\ude02 I bought these because of all the great reveiws, and because it came with nine pieces. The zippers seem sturdy and work great. I can't wait to try these when we travel abroad next year. The only negative (which is not a deal breaker for me), is that I ordered two sets and they both came with two of the smallest bags pictured and no laundry bag. I feel like I wouldn't get much use out of that anyway, because not that many dirty clothes would fit in there. I also got a great deal on these with the Amazon Days sale. It just would have been nice to receive what is pictured so you know what you are getting. I will more than likely use the cubes for the dirty clothes as I wear them and then just turn them upside down in my suitcase like was suggested by another buyer. All in all these are really made well, sturdy, quality material, and have nice zippers, and the sizes of the cubes are perfect for me!",

                "reviewText": "I loved this set and bought 4 sets of the 9 pieces. I usually don't write reviews let alone long ones but this product deserves special mention and made packing and unpacking as problem free as possible on a 2 week trip to Europe. Initially I started to buy another more expensive competitor's product and realized that each individual bag is sort of small. By the time I bought 4 bags each for the 4 of us in our family it was super expensive and twice the price as to what I paid for getting twice the number of bags and bigger sizes with this Gonex product, ie I bought 4 sets of 9 bags. Keep in mind 2 of the bags are small, they can fit a pair of shoes for my tween, my other daughter used it for toiletries, and I used it for electronics. They still were useful. That still leaves 7 bags ranging from XL to S. I was initially going to buy the vacuum bags but that seemed like a pain and last I checked air doesn't weigh anything in my luggage and I've never had problems pushing air of a suitcase. Not sure why a vacuum is needed for packing but to each their own. Also didn't want all my clothing wrinkled and crunched into a pancake.So I got these and they were a god send. Don't underestimate the importance of just plain organizing on a long trip, let alone with many family members. We went to Europe for 2 weeks and each family member packed and organized their clothing in these 7 (or 9) bags. You can organize pants, undergarments, shirts, whatever. I packed the suitcases and then decided I didn't organize everything well and instead of taking out piles of clothing items and having everybody's stuff all over and mixed up and unfolded now, I just took out the bags and re-organized. Because everything is in bags you can just move them around until you're happy with your suitcase. These bags also hold a lot more than you think. I had 8 shirts in the XL bag and 3 pants and 2 shorts in the large bag. Small bags fit the trips worth of socks and underwear each. One medium bag was used for carry on luggage to bring 2 days worth of clothing in case checked luggage was lost.In the hotels, just unzip and keep your clothes in the bags and flip the top over. When it was time to pack, just zip up the bags and throw them back in the suitcase. As the trip progressed, I started using some of the bags for dirty laundry and just folded the dirty clothes and put them upside down so I knew what was clean/dirty. By the end of the trip, all the items were dirty but again, well organized so packing wasn't just throwing heaps of clothing into the suitcases.I've never used bags like this before but won't ever go on a trip without them now. Wife and kids loved them as well. They are good quality and zipper worked well. They have handles but they are not luggage so I just used the handles when taking the bags out of the suitcase and bringing to the drawers/closets. They are mesh so are not waterproof, but I didn't buy them to be waterproof. If you want them to be waterproof, put them in a kitchen garbage bag.",

                "reviewText": "When I first heard of packing cubes, I thought it was another way to retrieve more money from a person\u2019s wallet. It didn't appear right away it would be that beneficial to packing. Merely another layer of housing to sort through before obtaining items you packed.Was I ever wrong? Now that I have discovered them and used them ... I wouldn't pack without them. If you check out my YouTube video where I used three packing cubes and L.L. Bean stowaway day pack for a three month stay ... you will see just how valuable they are. I'll post the link here, I think Amazon will be okay with it, if not they can remove link. [UP FORNT: The YouTube link does not earn any money from views, video is 100% my own content, and all products in video were bought by me.

I even use to store paper documents I've achieved in a couple of cubes. They hold a great deal, the handle makes them easy to carry, on a shelf they are hardly noticeable due to their black hue.I bought one set of four first to see how well they would work and then turn around and acquired another set of four. I' currently thinking about a third set. I like the fact they are breathable with rip-stop nylon. Secondly, once they aren't used for their current purpose, they can be used for other things including the purpose they were designed for.The quality is clear as is the consistancey in size and shape.\\\\DIGITAL SIGNATURE --- \\>I close my reviews with a THANK YOU because I do appreciate you investing precious time in reading my material.

Well ,was I pleasantly surprised ! Very good quality ,paying special attention to the zippers which are appropriately large and strong. These are well made with desired structure, while they are easily collapsible for more convenient storage . Attractive (pink ), sturdy,and roomy while price is very reasonable and arrived quickly .Now to order a set for hubby. I have recommended this brand to my friends as I am very happy with all aspects of this entire transaction. Thank you.",

It made such a difference packing and finding clothes using these compared to other travels where I threw everything into a backpack together. I used one for pants, one for shirts & sweaters, one for socks & underwear, and the smaller one for carry-on items and electronics. They fit nicely into my travel backpack, and the slippery material on the outside made it easy to stuff & slide them in once my bag was getting full of souvenirs. I definitely won't travel without these from now on.",

The Gonex product is well constructed with good quality material and zippers, and is priced very competitively with other brands of similar quality, Would never travel without using them, and would highly recommend the brand.",

Packing cubes are a great way to do that; during a recent trip to Mexico we managed to get everyone's clothes into one suitcase.They also work well for keeping things organized. Each person gets their own cube and which makes finding someone's clothes a lot easier. I especially liked this set came with three cubes the exact same size. The medium cubes hold a lot of stuff. Plus having three cubes the exact same size is a lot more useful and easier to pack than sets where you get bags of various sizes along with drawstring bags.Overall I am pretty happy with this set, and I have a feeling we will be using these for a long time.",
