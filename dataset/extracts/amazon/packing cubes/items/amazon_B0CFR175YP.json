I was able to fit more than I expected in every size and they provide needed organization to a large bag. I had the bag packed before getting the cubes and after putting things in the cubes I definitely hade more room!",

                "reviewText": "OVERALL RATING: For the 6 piece Set in Gray\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I'm pleased to share a 4-star review for the Compression Packing Cubes Set. This travel accessory has proven to be a valuable addition to my packing routine, offering a blend of functionality and convenience. Here are the key highlights:Efficient Packing:- The compression feature of these packing cubes is a game-changer. It allows for more efficient use of space in my luggage, ensuring that I can pack more items without sacrificing organization.Organization Made Easy:- The set includes multiple cubes in different sizes, facilitating organized packing. I appreciate the variety, as it enables me to categorize items and access them with ease during my travels.Material:- The quality of the zippers is commendable. The material itself feels nice to the touch, which is important to me.Limited Compression Effect:- While the compression feature is effective to some extent, there are limitations to how much one can compress clothing. Bulkier items may not experience as much compression as thinner fabrics.Conclusion:The Compression Packing Cubes Set has proven to be a reliable companion for organized and efficient travel packing. While the compression effect may have its limits, the overall benefits make this set a worthwhile investment for travelers seeking an organized and stress-free packing experience.In summary, these packing cubes have enhanced my travel packing routine, and I would recommend them to fellow travelers seeking a balance between organization and space efficiency. Especially if you are borderline OCD like I am. The needs to sections things out and not wanting certain item to touch, while still be able to controls a little of the space aspect with the compression is great!",

                "reviewText": "I have the four piece set in cyan. I\u2019m happy to have this bag set that does not have mesh to add to my collection (of compression bags and packing cubes) so that I can pack things that I want to protect from moisture, stains and pests. You understand, I want to protect the fabrics most at risk to those things, like cashmere. So, I value that my clothing is well protected in these bags. It makes sense that this full nylon bag is less likely to tear than the mesh on the breathable bags may be.I think these bags save space by compressing the air out and allowing you to then use that space in your suitcase for more items. In the first photos I have 13 t-shirts in the bigger bag and 9 t-shirts in the smaller bag. When I follow their recommendations and fold the items uniformly I save space and if I balance the items in the bag I think I get a more balanced rectangle shape.Have you ever waited at the luggage carousel for your bags and watched someone else\u2019s luggage coming down with a broken zipper and their items spilling out onto the filthy conveyor belt? These bags have another benefit. I would rather see my brightly colored cyan compression bag spilling out of my suitcase than to see my bras, underwear or silk blouse out there! Don\u2019t you agree? We also put half an index card with our name and address in each bag in case the compression bag gets separated from the suitcase.This bag has short but sturdy zippers that are made much better by nice thick zipper pulls. I use a label (that doesn\u2019t leave a residue) to identify what\u2019s in the bag. Hint: a window to label would be nice. Another benefit is that I find these bags do help keep us organized and find things when traveling. I also think it\u2019s much easier to strap these bags down using your internal straps than it is to strap a pile of loose clothing. That\u2019s even more secure if you are able to feed the suitcase\u2019s internal strap through the straps on these bags. This set is better than some of their competitors sets.",

Now picture this instead: you're gliding through security with a chic carry-on that's practically begging to be X-rayed (because let's be honest, these cubes are that cute). That's the OlarHike difference, baby!These pink packing cubes are more than just organizational witchcraft (although they are magic at maximizing space \u2013 I swear I fit a week's worth of clothes in my carry-on!). They're a travel aesthetic upgrade, like the Lululemon of luggage.Here's why I'm obsessed:They're like tiny vacuum bags for your clothes. The compression zippers shrink everything down to a fraction of its size, meaning more outfits, less suitcase stress. No more playing Tetris with your wardrobe!Built like a boss. Rip-resistant nylon? Check. Sturdy zippers that glide like butter? Check. These cubes are ready for anything, from weekend getaways to globetrotting adventures.Organization on fleek. Different sizes for different stuff \u2013 genius! No more rummaging for your socks in a laundry explosion. Plus, the drawstring bag for dirty clothes is a game-changer.Fits like a glove. Seriously, these cubes conform to any suitcase like liquid. Carry-on, checked, duffel bag \u2013 they're down for whatever.Okay, maybe they're not the cheapest cubes out there. But for the space-saving magic, the durability, and the sheer cuteness factor, they're worth every penny. Plus, the satisfaction guarantee means you can buy with confidence.Bottom line: If you're a travel warrior (or even just a weekend warrior), do yourself a favor and grab these OlarHike cubes. They'll transform your packing game from frantic to fabulous. Trust me, your future self (with perfectly organized socks) will thank you.",
