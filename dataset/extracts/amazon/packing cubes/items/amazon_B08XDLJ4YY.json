I received my first set as a gift and thought I may never use it because I thought I traveled well without the extra bags. Later, when I wondered how I had ever traveled without them, I gifted a set to someone who initially felt the way I had.Now, we both find these bags essential. The sizes are perfect for clothes, make-up, medicines, etc. and make each item easy to locate without rifling through a suitcase.They are very light, they take up very little space when empty, they are durable, they wipe off easily with a damp cloth, the zippers are sturdy, and the mesh top lets one see the contents and yet is sturdy enoughnot to snag.I have not written a review this lengthy about any other product. The price is incredibly low for the quality. If there were a ten star option, I would give the bags ten stars.",

                "reviewText": "I am not a very organized person. However, I constantly strive to be that way, and absolutely love products that help me stay neat and organized...And also keep me as sane as possible with a toddler!!I found these TravelWise packing cubes a few weeks back when my family was preparing to fly to Palm Springs, CA for vacation. I was skeptical, so I just ordered my own set for that trip. I compared several other packing cubes based on price, amount and variety of sizes included and colors. I chose TravelWise because you get five bags of differing size, and I liked the purple option!I was absolutely shocked when my suitcase was neat and easy to pack!! I rolled everything into each cube and neatly packed it into my suitcase. The best part was how organized I stayed during the trip. Usually my suitcase ends up a disaster and I have to essentially re-pack the night before we head home. This time, I didn't!! I showed my sister (who was not looking forward to re packing all of her family's suitcases before leaving) and she thought they were amazing. She ordered three sets for her family (one for each member), and I ordered two more for our family, one for my husband and son. We leave for Maui in a week, and my son's suitcase is already packed...!These packing cubes will give you peace of mind, and make your life just a little easier. As a mom of a young child, I also don't want to have to deal with tiny clothes getting mixed up in my son's suitcase (these packing cubes even make it easier for my 2.5 year old to keep out of the suitcases! He has a tendency to make messes of everything!)The bags are well-made with high quality zippers, which was important to me. The lining of the fabric feels like it has kind of a water repellant, if not plastic-type coating. They each come with a nice handle, so they're easy to carry. The mesh area makes it nice to see what you've packed in each one! I feel like I was able to get so much more in my bag--(I got so much in that my bag was overweight, luckily I just popped one of my cubes out and put it in my husband's bag. Usually I'm handing him shoes and arm loads of dresses or whatever if my bag is overweight! ;)I added some general photos of my son's suitcase packed. Once we all have our bags packed, I will add more photos. I can't recommend these more!UPDATE 7/2018 (a year later):I am still in love with these packing cubes!! We have made several more trips using the TravelWise cubes since my initial review. They are honestly such a time/stress saver. I didn\u2019t mention this before, but one thing I love about these cubes is that whether you\u2019re staying in a rental/house/hotel, you can immediately unpack your suitcase by popping your cubes into the drawers provided at your vacation spot! I have never done that in my life, mainly because it just seemed like a hassle, and I worried I\u2019d forget things in the drawers. The last few trips we\u2019ve taken, I\u2019ve put the cubes in the drawers (so organized!) and then we were able to free up our room by putting our suitcases in the closet! In the past, we would all have our suitcases sitting out, half-opened with clothes spilling out. Having to maneuver around luggage in a small room when my toddler needs space to play is a pain. It\u2019s so nice to free up much needed room in our living space!This last trip we took, my husband got a new hardsided luggage set. If you have these or have seen them, you kind of have to pack each side and then sandwich them together. Not a problem when you have these travel cubes! I had my son use one of my smaller suitcases to consolidate on our last trip. It also happens to be a hard sided suitcase. This one doesn\u2019t have the greatest system to hold the contents on either side in place for when you fold the suitcase up to close it. Now that we have the packing cubes, there are no sleeves or pant legs hanging out that need to be tucked in. Just the cubes to arrange!!Lastly, I am impressed at the durability of these cubes. Here we are, a year and several trips later, and all 15 of our family\u2019s cubes are in awesome condition. I have stuffed some of mine so full that I was worried the zipper would pop or the seams would rip (oops!) Not one of them has lost its functionality in any way. These are one of my favorite Amazon buys. I still can\u2019t recommend them more!",

It keeps your clothes well organized and doesn't make your suitcase a squirrels nest after you dig around for things you need. These seem to be a nice addition to the packing cubes we already have. I like the fact that you get different sizes to accommodate different kinds of clothing. The cubes seem to be will built. Even if you do not own packing cubes, at this price point you need to give it a try. I have no problem recommending these to anyone who travels a lot or just on occasion.",
