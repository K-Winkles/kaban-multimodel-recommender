I was a bit skeptical but I wanted something to help organize my things from my children\u2019s things when we go on short trips; I tend to throw my little ones\u2019 clothes into my suitcase along with my things so we have fewer bags to carry. These bags worked so well. They\u2019re very well-made, you can feel the durability when you touch them, the zippers are smooth and the material is nice and thick. The quality of materials is impressive for the price. Plus, the color design is super cute!We used the laundry bags for my toddler\u2019s toys, bedtime diapers, and toiletries. It was a more efficient use for us than utilizing them as actual laundry bags. My daughter loved the shoe bag.Overall, I loved this set! The price is perfect! This bag set feels and looks high-end, It looks like I paid a lot more than what I actually did. I ordered another bag configuration set from a different company and, although I paid more for it, it felt and looked cheaper than this set. This set looks great, I will be ordering more as gifts. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I've changed my three-star rating to four. Cathy at Mossio emailed me to apologize for the state of my packing cubes, which was totally unexpected but appreciated. To my surprise, she offered a refund AND a new set of cubes. Although I indicated that they didn't have to, since I still have the cubes and plan to use them, she initiated a refund and a new set arrived on my doorstep within a couple of days.Cathy was friendly and responsive. If each of their customer service reps is like her, your inquiries and/or issues should be addressed swiftly and kindly.Once the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is in the rearview mirror and I have an opportunity to use these cubes on a trip, I'll provide another update as to the cubes' ability to withstand use. Here's hopin' for a five-star sturdiness rating! :)~~~~~~~~~~I finally broke down and ordered packing cubes last night. I\u2019d been wanting some for months but had always been concerned about durability and quality, so I sprang for these relatively inexpensive ones (easier be impressed?).They arrived this afternoon, and as I inspected them, the lower quality became apparent. One pouch had several rust-colored stains inside (a couple of stains those pictured here). Another had a fabric edge that the thread hadn\u2019t caught (also pictured here). A couple of the zippers have imperfections (and aren\u2019t YKK zippers\u2014maybe the seller meant YKK-style zippers?).Either way, I was disappointed but not crushed. The seams seem sturdy enough, but I\u2019ll have to update my review once I\u2019ve had a chance to travel with them. On the bright side, the pattern is cute and the items are nice and lightweight.",
