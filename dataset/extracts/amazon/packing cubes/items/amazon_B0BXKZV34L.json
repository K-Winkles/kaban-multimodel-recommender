                "reviewText": "I got this packing cube set for my daughters first upcoming international trip. If you have never used packing cubes? they are a game changer. It makes it super easy to organize ypur stuff without your luggage exploding all over the room. They are a must habe especially of you are backpacking through multiple cities.This set offers a larger quantity of cubes than other sets I have purchased but tjey are much smaller. This is fine for my purposes but I think it would be harder to use with adult clothes. They do provide a guide on how to compactly fold different articles of clothing which was really nice. This set comes with 6 cubes, a shoe bag, and a small laundry bag.I think for the price it is a good set, just be aware that the cubes are a bit on the smaller end, but if you are backpacking maybe that would be preferable anyway.",

First I tried packing my clothes and clothes in my suitcase without using the cubes, the result was, I couldn\u2019t close my suitcase. So then I decided to give the cubes a try. What\u2019s my clothes are packed into each cube, I placed them into my suitcase. It was almost like magic. They were so compressed everything fit and I zipped up my suitcase no problem at all. These work, so well I think I need another set and switch them out accordingly. This is a great value for the money and they\u2019re easy to clean up just wipe with a damp rag. You can even put them in the washing machine, but on delicate.",

One of the big selling points (and very important to me) is the construction quality and stitching. I can confirm that they are made with the care and precision that is claimed. The also come with a tri-fold that illustrates folding and packing tech for various clothing items, which I found informative. For my big items, like shirts and suit coats, I will probably continue to pack them in the same manner as before (stacked together and rolled into a \"cinnamon bun\" to avoid wrinkles), but for everything else, these are a god-send.Packing bags are pretty generic, and there are many brands to choose from. The build quality, attention to detail, and thoughtful design of Dec-Mec bags sets these apart from the rest. Recommended.",
