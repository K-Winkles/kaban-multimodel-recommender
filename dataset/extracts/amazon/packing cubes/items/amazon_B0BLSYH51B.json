                "reviewText": "Our objective was to be able to put things away in small bags as separators but not have luggage.As of today 1/10/23 we have not traveled with yet, but will be within a month. We do cruises or fly to destinations and these will make it easier for us to get through security quicker too. Everything separated but in 1 or 2 bags each (Travel light). We bought 2 different colors (White & Blue) for when we travel.So I have already tried prelim using the bags by packing for our next trip in a few weeks and here is my results:Good:1. They are collapsible which means less storage room needed (When emptied, they store in the luggage small side pockets. This is convenient.2. If I have a excursion, I can fill 1 small bag for the outing and not have to carry all the other bags. It can hold the phones, sunglasses, hats or whatever I need it to do. And when using the items...the bag folds up into my pocket. (this was planned this way)3. Costs - There are all kinds of bags to buy but these were a great deal for the price.4. Zippers - Not a large zipper, so they fold up out of the way.5. Lightweight and Thin - It so is light weight that my IPhone cover weighs more than the bag.6. Keeps my stuff from getting wet in rain or snow.Cons -1. They kept changing shipping dates - Not manufactures fault but it was late. 2 different shipments but ordered at the exact same time and they were in stock. Ugg2. Not sure yet on durability - this will be tested during our trips. The lining is not support thick so I would not put anything sharp in it. I am ok with this but others may not be.3. Came completely rolled up (I will up load the pictures later.Overall - I would give this a 9 our of 10 (because I have not tested on the road. Only practicing packing at home to see how it would function).For the price this purchase was worth it because it \"fits\" our needs.",

                "reviewText": "While these compress very well, I found them to be a little on the thin/flimsy side. The material was always getting caught and jamming the zipper. Found a way around it by putting my fingers under the zipper when zipping. Still, it was annoying, especially when I was in a hurry. They were a little small for my needs, but fit into my 26\" bag easily. I'll use them, but I wouldn't purchase again.",

I was able to take sufficient clothes shoes and toiletries for a 4 day trip in a small suitcase. I used the large one for pants, sweaters, and dresses. The middle one had all of my pj's, socks, and Langere and the small handled all toiletries. There was plenty of room for souvenirs and shoes in my case...even a leather coat. Love these.",

The fabric is thin, yet durable and I am absolutely astonished at how much fits in one cube!

Note: the items listed in the picture are for an average-sized 7 year old. He could easily carry all of his clothes in a backpack with room to spare (but I won\u2019t make him).
