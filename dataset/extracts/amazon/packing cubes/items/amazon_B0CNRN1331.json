I use these for quick business trips to fit a large amount of items into my smaller carry-on bag. Not having to check a larger roller bag saves me a ton of time at the airport, as with these cubes I can pack everything in my carryon. I would highly recommend these cubes to anyone who travels frequently for business or pleasure.",

The zippers are strong and so easy to operate and I was surprised on how much stuff I was able to carry inside each piece. Just give it a little squeeze and a bunch of other pieces will nicely fit. Not very crazy with the color, so i will be searching for other color options for me letting my husband use the gray set.",

                "reviewText": "As a frequent traveler, I've always been intrigued by compression cubes although I never owned any. Several YouTube videos convinced me that they don't maximize every inch of suitcase space (rolling clothes and fitting them into every nook & cranny does that), but they do efficiently use space AND maximize organization inside the suitcase. So I ordered three different sets to compare what makes a good compression cube. I packed 3 sweatshirts, 2 pair of men's jeans, 5 XL t-shirts, and 10 pair of men's crew socks into 4 cubes. I then checked to see if the cubes would fit into my TravelPro 21\" carry-on suitcase.This set is really nice. It felt like the quality of the materials used were very good. It has 5 compression bags; 2 \"large\", 2 \"medium\", and 1 \"small\", plus two regular shoe bags (which to me doesn't add much as I already have shoe bags). All the items fit into four of the packing cubes, one large, 2 medium, and the small...I didn't use the second large cube. I was able to close the compression zipper on each cube pretty easily by myself. The four cubes fit into the 21\" carry-on, but unlike the others I had to use the suitcase expander to make it close. I found the \"large\" bags overall were larger than the other two brands that I bought, and although they would be great for packing items in a suitcase that one would check in, they were less likely to be used with a carry-on. I deducted one star for that reason. The bags are opaque; I prefer translucent bags so I can see what is in them without opening them.Overall very good quality bags. I would recommend them to anyone who wants larger bags for use in checked bags, or only needs the three smaller bags for a carry-on!",

I packed the kids clothing in one, mine in another, my slippers in the shoe bag and still had one leftover for dirty laundry! As far as compression goes, they do compress but, it can be hard to get them zipped if they're packed to capacity. I don't feel like it saves a ton of space but, I honestly bought for organizational purposes, so that doesn't bother me much. Love the fun pink color and the high quality materials. I feel like these are made exceptionally well and will last for many years. Pricing matches what you recieve.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered these Compression Packing Cubes for Suitcases for my 13 year old son as a Christmas present. He is really cute about getting his 'Fits' together which is slang for an outfit but somehow means a lot to his generation to drop the 'out' from the front of the word. He is going on a middle school trip to Washington DC and being able to set up multiple outfits and and compress them so they can fit in his carry on luggage which is the limit for the trip.The cubes are well made with fairly thick material that I believe will partially shed water. The zippers are decent quality and heavy duty. the downside to that hefty construction is that these are not super light, they do add some weight to your bag, which might be a consideration if trying hard to stay under that 50 lb limit for checked bags on airlines.Overall they appear to be well made and the listing is accurate. In that case I typically give out 5 stars, this item is showing a 20% off coupon already which makes it a little more competitive price wise.",
