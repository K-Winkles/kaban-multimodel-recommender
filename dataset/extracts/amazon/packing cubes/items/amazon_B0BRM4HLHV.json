Since I have limited space (one carry on), this is a lifesaver! Satisfied. This is the first set of compression packing cubes that I own and I'm pretty satisfied with it. I'm satisfied with the quality of the zippers, the lightweight fabric that its made out of, the amount of clothing that I was able to get inside and with how they fit in my luggage. My new favorite traveling buddies! I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when these arrived. They are very lightweight, and the zippers (the weak point, I suspect) seem to be well made. The laundry bag was a nice extra to include, and something that I will very definitely be able to use! Light weight, compression packing cubes for suitcases that make travel convenient. I like the light weight (about 1 lb 6 oz) and double zip compression closures of these packing cubes. It is not only you can pack more clothes in the given suitcase volume; but also you can pack your clothes in an organized manner.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a set of packing cubes and I must say, I am thrilled with my purchase. These packing cubes have completely transformed the way I pack for trips and have made my travel experience so much more organized and efficient.First and foremost, the value for the price of these packing cubes is outstanding. The set comes with multiple cubes in different sizes, giving me plenty of options for organizing my belongings. The quality of the cubes is exceptional, especially considering the affordable price point. I feel like I got a great deal for the value I received.One of the things that immediately caught my eye was the color combination of these packing cubes. The vibrant colors not only make them visually appealing but also make it easy to differentiate between the different cubes. This has proven to be incredibly helpful when I'm searching for specific items in my suitcase.Despite their compact size, these packing cubes can fit an impressive amount of clothing and other essentials. I was amazed at how much I was able to pack into each cube. The design and construction of the cubes allow for efficient use of space, maximizing the amount of items I can bring with me on my travels.Sturdiness is another standout feature of these packing cubes. The fabric and stitching are of excellent quality, ensuring durability and longevity. The cubes can withstand the rigors of travel, protecting the items inside. I have no worries about them getting damaged or falling apart.The strong zipper on these packing cubes is another aspect that I appreciate. The zipper glides smoothly, making it easy to open and close the cubes. I have had no issues with the zipper getting stuck or breaking, which is a common problem with other packing cubes I have used in the past.One of the features that I absolutely loved about these packing cubes is how they expand. This expansion feature allows me to pack even more items when needed, without compromising the integrity of the cubes. It's a wonderful added bonus that provides flexibility and convenience.In conclusion, I highly recommend these packing cubes. The great value, attractive color combination, ample storage capacity, sturdiness, strong zipper, and expansion feature make them an essential travel accessory. They have simplified my packing process and have made me more organized on my trips. If you're in need of reliable and efficient packing cubes, look no further.",

                "reviewText": "These are a must have for travel, especially if you tend to overpack and always have to remove items from your checked luggage on flights. It makes it so much easier, plus it helps you keep your luggage more organized. I think they definitely allow for more space so you can fit lots more into your luggage. I used all the bags (minus the drawstring bag and clear bag) and two bags that you can press all the air out, plus put toiletries and other items in my luggage, and my luggage ended up with over 60 lbs somehow on my recent trip. I always overpack, so these made it easy to just grab the entire bag rather than sort items to remove. (I always prepare to have space in my carryon just in case, but ideally carry the least amount possible.) The air compressed bags are great, too, for packing tons of stuff, but they will definitely wrinkle the clothes, and it can be hard to remove the air sometimes.These bags are made with thin material, but they're pretty sturdy so far. I packed a ton into one of these, even the smaller ones. It doesn't seem like they would zip to compress them, but even when I filled the bags completely, they still zipped with a little effort. The zipper can get stuck on the bag/fabric when you're compressing the bags, but I just stuck my finger under the zipper to push it out of the way. Overall, these are great! The price was reasonable compared to others, although, they're still pricey. That's the main complaint for me since they're not anything super special compared to other packing bags. They just add another zipper around them to allow for compression, but the material they're made from isn't any better than cheaper packing cubes which made me a little nervous I'd tear them. I only used them once, but I would definitely buy these again.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first trip using a tiny suitcase (doll suitcase as I call it.) I am the type of packer that actually packs anything I might need on a trip. This trip is a quick one and I don't want to bother with standing around waiting for luggage, losing luggage, paying for extra suitcase, etc. I decided I would take my tiny suitcase, never used. I was having a difficult time putting what I needed in the suitcase when a friend of mine told me about these. I ordered them immediately and received them quickly. They actually do help with your packing. I can get a lot more in the suitcase and they are easy to use. They help me keep order to my packing and my items. I wish they would compress just a bit more but the overall packing a tiny suitcase experience has been easier with these and less stressful. As to durability, I am not sure yet but will come back and add to this review either way.",

These PFEYRPK Ultralight Compression sacks were a couple of dollars less expensive than the other type which is more popular and I now know why.The zipper construction was weaker. The top zipper didn't open as far and was a single zipper design. Some of these these sacks started to fray within the first two weeks of usage. The bag itself is definitely made of lighter material, but that meant they didn't really compress flat, but more rounded. That's great for shoes, but I needed to compress shirts, sweaters, and pants. They worked, but not as I was hoping for.",
