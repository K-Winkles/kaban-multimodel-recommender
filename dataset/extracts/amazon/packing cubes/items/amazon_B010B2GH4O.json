We used it to pack our underwear. We often fly into a city, spend a day or two in the city, then board the ship. With this, we could do the two day stay. And use the bag to store the dirty in the second section of the bag, and keep the clean pristine! Once we get to the ship, we dump the contents of the dirty side in their laundry bag and send it off.",
