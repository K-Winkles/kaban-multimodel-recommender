They are easy to use and they compress my clothing perfectly, giving me so much more room in my suitcase. I\u2019m posting a pic showing one cube that is compressed and one that isn\u2019t to show the difference compressing the cubes makes. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I tried them because I didn\u2019t realize how much more packing space I\u2019d be left with. My sister borrowed them for her holiday travels and liked them so much that she ordered herself a set. Now my only question is\u2026When will this come in PINK?",

I\u2019m annoyed with myself I didn\u2019t look before I purchased the pricey branded ones!! Anyway the rest of my family love these and it\u2019s beautiful & very well made.

                "reviewText": "First of all, these packing cubes are absolutely the best quality cubes I've come across. They're very sturdy, the materials all are high quality, and you don't feel like it'll rip apart the moment you're trying to compress the cubes. So on that side of things, they're a clearly great option.However, I'm not sure why this specific 4-Pack option comes with these 4 cubes/rectangles. None of them are particularly large, even the 'large' one. In fact, in most packing cube sets, the large one would barely be considered to be a medium. I get that these are higher quality, but they're also much costlier than the average packing cubes, so you'd expect them to be about the same size as what the lower cost competition is offering. In fact, the 'small' one is so small you can barely put anything in it, maybe besides a few socks or underwear, if that. Even the image on the product's page shows earphones and chargers as things you could put in the small cube, but plastic items are useless to put in compression packing cubes.They are made of an unusually sturdy plastic fabric -- more like what you'd get on a light-duty handbag. Most other compression cubes are made of a rip-stop kind of thin plastic. This can be a plus or a minus, depending on whether your luggage will be weighed at the airport -- sometimes every little bit counts.The construction is very good. Extremely good. Each cube comes with durable zippers, and of course, they need to be sturdy because of the 'compression' feature. By closing the zipper, you 'smush' down the contents so that you can pack more tightly into your suitcase. And I have no doubt that these will be perfect.I also love the mesh window, so you can see the contents. This is another one of those features that are not seen on lower-quality sets and it's a nice bonus to be able to see what's inside.So I do absolutely love this set of packing cubes. What I don't love is the price.While I can wholeheartedly, earnestly recommend the quality of these, and I know the brand is a reputable one. But please know they are a great set of packing cubes that seem to come with a stiff premium.",

                "reviewText": "I own several packing and compression cubes and this is easily the best one. Super impressed with the overall quality and functionality.First, the double zippers design works EXACTLY the way it is meant to - they glide effortlessly, ensuring a hassle-free packing experience, and smoothly press down on the clothes to compress the bulk.For reference, I went on a 2-days trip this weekend and carried only one backpack - I used the Extra Large cube and was able to pack all of the following inside of it: 2 shirts, night clothes, underwear, socks, a medium size towel and my essentials (moisturizer, lip balm, contact lens kit, hair clips)! There was still some room left and I'm a plus size girl so my clothes are larger and take more room - again, very impressed. All my clothes were super neatly organized in the cube and fitted in my backpack easily - the cube also helped to create some symmetry in how the weight was distributed and didn't make my bag look weirdly shaped, the way it usually does when I put my clothes directly in my backpack.The washable aspect of these packing cubes is also very convenient as you can make sure your cubes are clean and odourless for your next trip.Main negative point is the price as they are quite pricey but, honestly, they have excellent value so if you are someone who travels with limited space they are really helpful.I will also mention the inclusion of a note in the product box, promising a free gift by using a specific link or QR code, where you have to fill out your information. While the packing cubes themselves are exceptional, I wasn't a fan of this marketing approach.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR - Overall build quality is excellent. These feel robust, the fabric feels great in hand, and they function as advertised, but if only they didn't skimp on the zippers. It would have been perfect.Now that I've experienced the Aerotrunk cubes, my other packing cubes feel like hot garbage. Seriously. The quality is immediate upon opening them. The fabric is slightly thicker and feels good in hand. The stitching looks uniform and inspires confidence. And the hardware itself looks great, but unlike their luggage offerings, these do not sport YKK zippers. And tragically, it shows.So close to perfection, and yet so far. I would gladly pay the additional cost to upgrade the zippers.Let me explain.The standout feature of these packing cubes is their ability to compress. You squish your stuff down as much as you can and use the 360 degree zipper to lock in that compression. But you know what ruins that experience? When the damn zipper catches when it starts to get a bit tight. Three out of the four sides I found myself struggling to ensure a smooth zip. Am I overloading these? Yes, absolutely. That's the point. I want to fit as much stuff into my luggage, and shrink it down to a size that defies the laws of physics. And this is how the average individual will use these.I'm not saying YKK zippers would help you bend space time to your will, but a higher quality zipper would definitely elevate the experience.That said, I have no problem at all recommending these packing cubes. They are literally the best I've experienced thus far and would highly, HIGHLY recommend them. When you do manage to compress your clothing down to almost 50% of it's actual volume, boy does it feel good.4/5 PACKED CUBESAerotrunk, come earn that last star! I am rooting for you!",

                "reviewText": "I'll start off by saying that I'm entirely new to packing cubes. I wish I had known about these (or even the non-compression version) years ago. I'm the kind of traveller that low-cost airlines hate, because if there's an extra fee for a carry-on bag, I'll take whatever the bigger bag I can take as a free personal item instead.There would have (and will, going forward) save me so much frustration when travelling with just a kitbag (or with a carry-on!) Not only are they great for staying organized, but they really do save space. In the three pictures I've attached, I'm showing the largest of the 4 packing cubes included in this set. I've packed it with a bunch of polo shirts and two pairs of shorts for a theoretical trip down south (first picture). Second picture shows the cube zipped closed but not compresed. And finally, picture 3 is the fully compressed cube.So it doesn't shrink your whole closet down to nothing, but it does save you a bit of space, and every cubic centimetrr matters.In terms of durability, I'll have to edit this review down the road with my actual findings, but from a first inspection: these are high quality cubes. Well constructed, strong fabric and zippers...I have a very good feeling these will last They're also just nice to touch and have a very premium feel.They did take a while to get to me (though they arrived at the early part of the shipping window Amazon set out for me, so I can't take away any points there, just don't order the two days before your trip). Oh, and there was a coupon in the package for a free baggage scale, which I'm super excited to receive - that will be another lifesaver. Thank you, Aerotrunk.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I must confess that the concept of Packing Cubes was new to me. I acquired a set of ordinary cubes to help keep things organized on an upcoming trip. I'll be in at least 6 different hotels for a day or two and segmenting my luggage contents will make them easier to find and repack. These are Compression Cubes though. See my video demonstrating how they actually save space.The set contained 4 cubes of differing sizes (see photo). All had a mesh \"window\" so you can see the contents readily. Their construction seemed sturdy. All were lined and had heavy duty zippers. The vendor provided no instructions with them nor did they suggest best practices on their web site. If you search the web for videos using the search term \"Packing Cubes,\" you can find a wealth of information about making best use of them. One online source estimated the space savings from using compression cubes at 15-30%. Obviously, your mileage may vary and success is dependent on your clothing being wrinkle resistant.As a bonus, the vendor provided a QR code that sends you to a \"VIP\" web site. They note that their cubes may cause your bags to be heavier, so they offer a free digital luggage scale for registering. I have thus far not received any confirmation, but the vendor claims they will ship it within 5 days.While the truth is in the traveling, I am fairly confident that these will be a real convenience on my next trip. Highly recommended.",
