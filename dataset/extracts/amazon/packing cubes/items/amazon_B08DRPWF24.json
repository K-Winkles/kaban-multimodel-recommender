Once at our destination, it was much easier to unpack and stow our clothes. I will be ordering small sizes but I highly recommend them!",

The quality is not the best. One of the zippers is already separating but I was able to fix it. These were a little less expensive than other brands so you get what you pay for. Good enough for occasional use.",

                "reviewText": "After all the hype I decided to purchase two different types of packing cubes and give them a try. I was excited about these due to the large size. I figured they\u2019d be great for bulkier things. However, after the first use the seams split in multiple cubes and my clothes began coming out. I ended up shuffling items for the return trip, so I didn\u2019t lose anything too valuable. You can see here my husbands swim trunks are attempting an escape from the bottom seam of the cube. I don\u2019t recommend these. I purchased another brand to try and they were better so I ended up purchasing three additional sets - one for each member of the family, so we could each have our own color. The idea of cube packing did live up to the hype, just not with these cubes.",
