                "reviewText": "The bag is great, but beware! There are three bags in the photo, the title is plural but only one bag arrives at your door, hence the low price. The one star review is for saying \u201cbags\u201d instead of \u201cbag\u201d and the photo with three items in it instead of one. The bag itself is fine.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this as a gift for my sister. It is well-made, but the photo in the advertisement showed three cubes in different sizes. When I went to add to my cart, it did not have me choose a size, so all along, I believed that I was getting all three. She received the package and there's only one. Disappointing. The ad should say, choose S, M or L AND when you select to buy, it should indicate the sizes.",
