Not sure if it\u2019s by design or my determination to get all my clothes in the organizer! Overall really enjoyed them and felt like it helped keep my clothes stationary and organized while traveling! Will use again!",

Second bag, 1 pair of joggers, and 6 lightweight shirts. Second zipper popped off. I would say best for about 4 outfits at the most.",

While the design is super cute, many of the zippers were either super tight, nearly impossible to zip closed, getting caught on the \u201cfabric\u201d of the sides, or just didn\u2019t zip at all. The largest bag would not compress. One half of the zipper was sewn in backwards, so it just wouldn't zip. If I hadn\u2019t already thrown away the packaging, I\u2019d try to return it. You\u2019re definitely getting what you pay for by buying cheaper packing bags.",
