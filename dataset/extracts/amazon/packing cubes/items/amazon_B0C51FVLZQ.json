                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE these. I have used packing cubes for my international travels for years, but I had never tried compression because I couldn\u2019t find any with a fully clear or mesh top panel. To stay organized and remember what I have, my items must remain visible once packed. I currently own cubes that are made entirely of reinforced, clear pvc, but they take up a lot more space in my bag than these. With a clear pvc center and see-through mesh sides, the tops of these cubes are perfect! I also purchased a Baggallini set with 2 medium and a large cube in this style. The large is the same length as these slim cubes, but are approx 2.5x wider. Large is perfect for jeans, large pants, outerwear and other bulky items. The medium work well for most of my pants and long sleeve or bulky tops. The slim ones are great for undergarments, sleepwear, swimwear and lightweight shirts. I think the combination of 1 large, 2 medium and 2 slim will fit nicely in my carry on and work beautifully for most of my trips. They feel very sturdy and durable. I\u2019ll update if I have any quality or durability issues after using these, but I\u2019m currently very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I have not owned compression cubes before this so I have nothing to compare my experience to.With that being said, I was looking for a similar product to the sold out Compass Rose 4 bag set and found this product. To test it out I fit a pair of tall leggings, a cotton long sleeve shirt and a pair of shorts in the bag pictured. I feel like I could have stuffed a pair of socks in at the end as well. To my surprise it fit perfectly across my standard Away carry on. I expected the zipper to break when testing it out bc these seem to be generally used for smaller clothing items but it didn\u2019t! So far so good! I\u2019m using 2 in my carry-on-only 8 day trip. One for undergarments &socks and one for pj shorts & camis.I\u2019ll update after my trip.",

                "reviewText": "I love this brand but they missed the mark for compression. The material is too rigid, the plastic on the front is too thick, and the zippers are awkward. This slim style is smaller than expected. I put 3 ladies T-shirts in and it was very tight and not suitable for the price of the bag. This is probably good for socks but I really don\u2019t need those divided from the rest of my items. It\u2019s a bummer and I am returning.",
