I purchased these for organizing backpacks for my family's upcoming multi-week hike on the Camino de Santiago. The small and medium size are perfect for backpacking. All three sizes will be great for regular traveling.Surprisingly, these strong organizers are even lighter weight than the packing organizer set from a rival brand we used previously. I plan to bring a small pillowcase and transform the smallest one into a pillow at night.",

The contents are somewhat visible through the front mesh, but I think it's easier to rely on the separate colors to quickly identify what's packed in each one (which is why I bought Travelon, as other sets only came in one color). The zipper works well, but I wish it had two pulls. They are a good size for a small carry-on suitcase.",

Only my jeans were loose in my luggage.The 3 different sizes are great to get various type of items organized.The zippers are sturdy. I still open them carefully knowing the fact, that with time they might break.
