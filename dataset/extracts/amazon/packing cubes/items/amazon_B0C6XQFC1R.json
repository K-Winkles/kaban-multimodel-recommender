This one is fully functional so based on this I\u2019ve updated my review to reflect the quality and the excellent customer service the seller demonstrated. The compression features of these are great, I was able to fit two in a travel backpack. Out of my first order I was able to use one of the cubes on my recent vacation and I could easily fit 7 bathing suits in one of the mediums.The true test will be how these replacements hold up and I look forward to using them on my next trip.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Searched high and low for the perfect cubes and thought I\u2019d found them. The design of these are great but the quality isn\u2019t there. The zipper on 2 of the cubes weren\u2019t even functional so they can\u2019t be used. I had to make due with the ones that did work since my trip is this weekend. The compression design is awesome but these aren\u2019t made sturdy enough to actually hold up to their purpose.",

One zipper us to close it, the 2nd zipper goes around the perimeter and \"flattens\" the clothing items.However, when I was packing, before even leaving for my trip, the perimeter zipper broke on one (I had not over stuffed it).I also found they really don't compress and space save like other brands. These are more of just an organizational packing system, in my opinion.I tried many folding styles to see how to maximize the amount of clothes in each bag. I found folding the clothing item flat, the size of the bag, and stacking them in the bag worked better than rolling.They're not very durable. But they did hold a lot of my clothes and it was nice to have my items organized in my luggage.I wouldn't buy these again, I'd find a more durable set that actually compresses, but these are cute.",
