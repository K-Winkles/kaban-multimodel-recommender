These packs allow you to pack your clothes in them, and then collapse them down like a vacuum bag, but no vacuum. I found that the large one could only hold my ski jacket and pants and was hard to collapse down. I may not know how to properly pack these things either, but it was kind of surprising that it didn\u2019t hold more. It was nice to have to organization of your clothes, but I feel like it didn\u2019t really save me space. Again, I may not be packing these right. I may need to watch a YouTube video hahaha!! They look nice (I got the cream color) and seem to be durable. I did not rip the zipper from the material (and I was really pushing!). They have a handle at the end of them so easy to grab them. I would recommend using them!",

These have a middle zipper that helps to compress everything down and helps when I can only take my carry-on with me. Definitely does squish things down more. You get 4 items, 1 slightly larger, then 2 middle pieces that are the same size and 1 slightly smaller one.",

The fact that they compress down allows for a little extra wiggle room while packing and it honestly helps items not be as wrinkled and not shift during the actual travel. There is a helpful tab at the base of the compression zipper that assists in getting it zipped down. This is a great feature that others don't have! If you don't have these they are great regardless of how much you travel!",

                "reviewText": "I used the 2 largest sizes to pack my duffel bag on a trip. Within the largest size, I stuffed jeans and pants on one side and hoodies on the other side. It was already a tight fit with the compression bag fully zipped open. When I closed it up and then tried to compress and zip, I couldn't do it. In the next compression bag, I put T-shirts, socks, underwear, and sports bras and was fully able to compress and zip all the way around because it was a lot less full. I managed to stuff my duffel and still had room for toiletries. I like that these are good sizes for me and they're great at keeping you organized.I personally had problems with the compression feature, but as a frame of reference, I've only owned one other compression bag (from Kickstarter) and that one was hard to zip because the zipper would get caught on the edge of the fabric. To be fair to the Kickstarter backpack/briefcase purchase, the compression bag was an add-on accessory. This particular set of compression bags were easier to zip than my Kickstarter compression bag, but I'm still not overly impressed yet with how it zips/compresses in general. I admit that I might be using it incorrectly, so take my experience with a grain of salt. Overall, it's still a nice set of organizers for travel.",

I love the size options in this set - some of the sets I have purchased come with cubes I\u2019ll never use because they\u2019re either way too big and way too small, but the sizes in this set are all very practical / useful. The compression feature works great and really allowed me to add more to my suitcase. They also maintain their shape without being too structured - some of the very structured ones take up extra space when not full but that is not the case with these. So far I have used them twice and washed them three times and they still feel like they are brand new. Overall a great product!",
