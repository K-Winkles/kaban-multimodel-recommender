                "reviewText": "These days of the week packing cubes are super useful. I purchased them for my 6 year old daughter for an upcoming trip to keep her suitcase organized and everything easy to find but can see these being useful for a variety of other things like summer camp or even daily assignments or reading (if the books are small).Here's what to know about these cubes:-This comes with 2 sets, so you have two of each day of the week which would be perfect for sleepaway camp or a longer trip.-Each day is a different color, so it's easy to tell them apart in your suitcase.-These easily fit an entire outfit (including panties, socks and a bow) for my daughter. She's a size 6 and I definitely had more room in each cube. I was packing stretch pants and t-shirts but I think there would still be room for a sweatshirt or some heavier clothes.-I also tried out some of my clothes to see if I could use these. I'm a ladies medium and was able to get an entire outfit of mine in a cube as well. I added a t-shirt and pants but don't think I'd have enough room for one of my sweaters. These really are intended for kids.-The zippers are strong and we didn't have any issues getting them zipped/unzipped.I really like these for organization at the price point. They're bright and fun and will definitely save us time getting ready each day of our trip.",

The colors make me happy because I travel a lot to tropical destinations and these fit the vibes perfectly.A great value, as well!What I do specifically is I put my makeup, accessories, and clothes for that day in the cube (of course my makeup is wrapped and stuff before I just throw it on in there, same for my jewelry) but it REALLY does help when you\u2019re on a trip and want a specific outfit for a specific day, etc. Worth the buy if you ask me!",
