                "reviewText": "I bought these backing cubes for planned work travel trips this fall, but have since learned that trips are cancelled. But these are very versatile and i used them for a hiking trip with my family. I was able to pack an extra set of clothes for my kids in a single large cube, slip it into my pack and have plenty of room left over. I'm glad I did as we ran into a pretty big rain storm and my kids were soaked to the bone as a result. Having clothes in a contained space and not taking a lot of space in my pack was great. Used the medium and other large cubes in my families travel duffel bag to retain space for other clothes and towels. I liked having the laundry bag as well as it was used immediate the day after I received it.From my initial use on a day hiking trip, I'm confident that these will work great for when I do start traveling. It compresses the clothes/gear down to a workable level and easy to pack. These will also come into good use for weekend away trips y wife and I take to limit the number of bags or the size of bag used. My initial use gave me a good indication that I got the right gear for me. I read a lot of reviews and though I typically prefer darker colors because they hide marks, dirt, stains better, I bought the wide ones so that I can see through easier and pick the cubes that I want or need for the day/use which I have. I have to say, that came in handy this past weekend as I pulled the exact cube I wanted to have in my pack for the trail.Now I know that someone reading this is wondering if it is water tight as I used it for dry clothes for my kids, the answer is no, but I had packed it in my dry bag in my pack with is water resistant. So when the rain ended and we were in a place to get clean clothes to my kids, we had it readily available.I bought these for a specific reason, e.g. capability of packing a week's worth of clothes/gear in a single duffel bag to travel, but used it for a different purpose and glad I did. Worked great and like the quality of the product. I would recommend using this for hiking, backpacking, or traveling.",

                "reviewText": "I used them for the first time and was happy with the results. I own quite a few of the Eagle Creek cubes and like those very much, but mine are the heavier weight fabric. The Cipway cubes are very lightweight. The zippers seem good and sturdy. The material seems substantial and not cheap or flimsy. The only thing I don't like is the opening. You put your clothes through a zipper on a short end of the cube. The zipper does go down about a third on one side and a few inches on the other side, so that helps, but it's a bit awkward trying to put things in. If you stack all the clothes you want to put in a pile, then put the whole stack in at the same time, that seems to be the easiest way to pack it. If you try to put items in one-by-one, you'll have a hard time keeping the wrinkles away. Also, when you're zipping up the compression zipper, shake the clothes away from the side you are zipping up, it makes it easier to zip up/compress the clothes and the extra fabric from the cube doesn't get caught in the zipper. Aside from the opening, I'm happy with my purchase. If I need more compression cubes, I would consider buying these again.",

And that only seems to work by sitting on the bag, squeezing it, cursing at it, and punching it down, and then you'll just end up taking something out to zip it anyway. So, not really compression bags as much as packing cubes. Still, helpful to organize. And for socks and undies fine compression, but definitely not big enough sized or compress-able enough for pants.",

They feel pretty durable and the zippers are solid too!It could be cool to have each cube with either a color marker, or a slightly different design, as it can be annoying trying to figure out which cube is which, but I tried sewing different colored markings onto them aha.",
