                "reviewText": "I am a chronic overpacker, so I got these cubes. The picture I\u2019ve included here is the XL bag that has my big wool coat, a tunic sweater, a pair of leggings, a tank top, and a pair of undies! It is insane! It wasn\u2019t hard to zip, either, and you don\u2019t need any weird air compressors. I put some undergarments and a T-shirt in the smallest one. I\u2019ve never had all my clothes fit on one side of my suitcase! Granted, I have a huge suitcase, but this is awesome! I am also not a small person, so my clothes are also not small! Haha I will probably get maybe another XL and L since I had to use one of my other packing cubes that doesn\u2019t really compress for the clothes I\u2019m wearing for the last day of my trip, but highly recommend these cubes!",

                "reviewText": "These are really good quality travel cubes!These are so handy to have for traveling. The set comes with four different compression cubes, a drawstring bag (I use it for dirty laundry), and a shoe bag. All of the compression bags work really well. They are made of a high quality material that is tear resistant which is really useful when you are trying to compress. Thick items like jeans. I don\u2019t love the way that the drawstring bag feels and the shoe bag doesn\u2019t work for all of my shoes but those are such small issues compared to how great this set is.The zipper pulls are good quality and the zippers easily glide. Making it much easier to compress your clothes. Perfect for organizing as well as making it easier to pack and get more space in your luggage.Overall really impressed, especially because at this price I did not expect such good quality!",

                "reviewText": "I am super impressed with these. I love that you can use with or without compression. Honestly, I crammed so much stuff in these that I expected the zippers to pop open. They didn't. At one point, I was legit sitting on one of them to compress it when I was gifted a very nice alternative down pillow 2500 miles from home--I got in there and compressed it down to a fraction of it's fluffy size. I've used packing cubes before but this is the first time I've used compression. I usually roll my clothes so many people argue that compression doesn't do much but I felt it helped a bit. I also felt my clothes were less wrinkled with these cubes. Packing was more fun with these--just watch the weight. On my last long haul, I checked 2 medium size suitcases (27 or 28 inches). One case, I had packed about \u2154 full with these cubes (one cube was my new pillow and another was a gifted throw blanket), my running shoes, 2 pairs of lightweight platform ankle boots and I was a bit over 40lbs. I'm ordering more to replace my non-compression cubes for my other case. Highly recommend to everyone!",

The extra large cube is perfect for big items like sweaters, while the small cube is ideal for socks and underwear. The set also includes one shoe bag to keep one pair of shoes separate and tucked away neatly.The best thing about these packing cubes is their compression feature.

I only took a carry-on, so it was crucial that my packing was organized, in order to help me make the best use of my small space. Having multiple size options between the different cubes helped me prioritize what items were best to bring, without letting everything mix, such as clothes with shoes. I loved these!",

I was able to fit six pairs of women's jeans in the largest bag (folded in half and then thirds). It was an extremely tight squeeze, but I was able to zip both layers of zippers closed. It definitely felt like I was testing the seams, but they held. I love the compression of the double layer zipper system! I could probably squish loose clothes in the suitcase just as much, but this way they all stay neat and organized. The rectangular sizes fit in a 20\" suitcase quite well.",
