Packing organizers of different sizes are used for different packing purposes. You can separate clothes (such as jackets, pants, t-shirts and socks) into different packing cubes for easy access.",
            "Save up to 60% Space: Just like how a vacuum sealer works, the compression zipper in the middle of the packing bag helps to expel excess air, which can save you up to 60% storage space after compression. These travel packing organizer cubes keep your clothes organized and help you store and carry more in the same bag.",
            "Tear Resistant to Last: The suitcase organizer bag set is made of high-quality polyester and high-density mesh with professional stitching, which is not easy to wear and tear under frequent use or compression. The bag's zipper has been rigorously tested many times to ensure smooth operation and reduce the possibility of snagging, allowing you to open and close the packing cube with ease.",
            "Lightweight Travel Essentials: Ultralight fabric ensures your clothes will fit neatly in your luggage without adding extra weight. These travel cubes are perfect when you want to reduce weight and save space in your carry-on, suitcase, or backpack.",
            "What We Care: Every traveler has their packing style preferences, and LUMESNER provides plenty of flexibility for any type of traveler. We hope to sell not just a commodity, but also a love. Love to travel, love the outdoors, love your journey. If there are any quality problems, please do not hesitate to contact us for a timely and satisfactory answer!"

I specifically purchased it because of the duplicate sizes. It doesn't make sense to me to have to play Tetris every time I pack, I'd rather have one cube sit on top of the other with the exact same footprint. They haven't been used yet, but the quality seems pretty decent. Here's a tip: most hotels have white sheets, so don't get white. Nobody wants to lose their compression bags when they're trying to pack to catch a plane, so grab an obvious color so they're easy to find. Hope this helps.",

The compression worked very well for the volume of thick coats and sweaters. The shoe bag material was an heavier weight and protected a favorite pair of shoes nicely. This set also made a clean, organized main compartment in a checked bag with an item that i knew would require TSA inspection. Highly recommend.",

But as far as saving room\u2026.not so much. I used 2 in a personal item for a budget airline to fly to Canada. It\u2019s hard to pack just a personal item for winter. You want room saver, compression bags are the way to go. 2 of the 4 on the trip used bags versus a cubes. I used compression bags for my 2018 Tokyo trip. I thought I would try out the compression packing cubes to help save room. Maybe for a time of year when clothes aren\u2019t so bulky. I like cubes in general but compression bags are the way to go for Winter pack.",

The quality was very good and they created alot of space in my suitcase with the compression. I was shocked at how much I could fit into one cube. There was alot of space when unzipped and then when I closed both zippers, I was amazed. Unfortunately I didn't take any photos, but I would definitely buy again. I bought the black and white cubes as they were the cheapest colour at the time of purchase. I only used them for one week and they sat in one spot the entire time so I don't know how they will go for our 6 weeks, on the go, vacation coming up, but looking at the quality, I believe they will be ok.",
