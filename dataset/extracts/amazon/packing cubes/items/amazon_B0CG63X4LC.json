                "reviewText": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with these packing cubes. The general principle is solid, and I used a few throw blankets to show how they can take fluffy items and squish them down into much smaller units for packing. But ironically, that sample picture might be the more realistic way these might get used in our home. We just don\u2019t seem to have either the organizational strategy or need for these within suitcases. In fact, I usually find that I NEED loose items to pack around liquids or breakable items, and our clothes aren\u2019t particularly fluffy where these can make such a tremendous difference. Maybe we would feel differently if we were traveling internationally or carrying different types of items, but these just haven\u2019t created any particular benefit for our travel needs.",

                "reviewText": "After previously experiencing problems with another company's compression cubes, I was a bit reluctant to order another set, notwithstanding the high frequency of my travelling. This set from Nestling looked great online, though, with more quality and attention to the details, so I placed my order. As advertised, these bags arrived in just as great condition as they look online! The bags are strong and sturdy, and the zippers move fluidly, both to open or close the bags. The little pics are very helpful to ID the contents, presuming that's what they are actually used for. I used them on my last trip, and I was very, very pleased! I love organization, and I don't mind having a box in a box, or in this case, bags inside a bag. These help me separate the contents and quickly access what I need. I was very impressed with how well the compression bags actually functioned, and held together under the stress of a compressed and tight load, and there was no failure in the stitching or the zippers. I would love to see one extra bag added that was solely for packing one spare outfit with underwear and socks included, so if needed, I could just grab that one bag if I had to stay another day or night, or if I needed a quick change of clothes while traveling, instead of going through each bag to get the one item I needed. That is just a suggestion, though, and there's no reason why this couldn't be done with one of the bags they include, so maybe it is more of a packing tip. Either way, I am pleased and confident in these packing cubes and recommend them to other travelers who like keeping their items organized and structured.",

In our world that will take us for a casual week! the second shot is before compressing it and the third is with the compression. Though heavy as as 6 pairs of jeans will be, the packed cube takes up the visual space of a small laptop case at the most. The cubes themselves weigh almost nothing but the zippers appear to be sturdy. I can't wait to see how much I will be able to get into the whole set.. Would definitely buy again!",

Once it was all zipped up it was a very compact package. Those clothes are not going to shift anywhere. We are going on our first trip with these bags so I will report back if there are any problems. The fabric is very nice. It feels like a ripstop nylon. The zippers caught a little in a few tight places but they were easily fixed by pushing some material back as you often have to do with jacket zippers.",
