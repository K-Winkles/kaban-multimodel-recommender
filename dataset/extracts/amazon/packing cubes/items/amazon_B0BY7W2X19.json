                "reviewText": "Star added and update 7/1/2023: I used these on a month-long trip. We stayed in most locations only two nights. These spared me so many headaches! It was easy to reach in and grab what I needed without rifling through and messing up the whole suitcase. I packed hiking pants in one bag, jeans and regular pants in another, t-shirts in the third, and winter gear (scarf, gloves, hats, thick socks, etc.) in the last one. It was so efficient that I just ordered more packing cubes today! Even though they weren't compressible (because they're mesh), it took up way less room in the suitcase because I could squeeze everything in the bag, so the only space was between bags and not between every article of clothing (if that makes sense). I rolled everything, not folded.I forgot to count how many t-shirts I got in a bag, but I went back to look at pictures. It was more than 10 because I had 2 long-sleeved silkies packed and pictures wearing 8 different tees, and I didn't wear them all. At least three of the tees were long-sleeved in addition to the silkies. Two of the long-sleeved ones were size large so I could layer other shirts under them. So each cube holds a good amount of clothing! I had at least 5 pairs of jeans and pants in one, including one pair of very wide-leg, high-waisted jeans.The fabric held up well on this trip. I didn't have trouble with the zippers. Hopefully they will continue to hold up and perform well. Very pleased!************Original review:I\u2019m going to have to pack these with my t-shirts and see how many fit. It looks like it won\u2019t hold nearly as many shirts as pictured, but I\u2019ll see. I wear a women\u2019s small, and I would be surprised if I could get even 6 t-shirts to fit as smoothly as that picture.I was worried they would be too big to be efficient for packing, but they aren\u2019t. I think a happy medium could have been found, but we\u2019ll see how it goes. I definitely am leaving one empty for dirties. (I like that better than my solid nylon bag for dirties \u2014 no breathing for the dirty clothes. Ick.)They are very thin and light, which is good for packing, but they feel almost flimsy. I\u2019ll see how they hold up with packing and will update my review with that information and a picture! \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I've seen like a bazillion articles and reviews going on and on and on about the virtues of packing cubes and I thought it was just a money making gimmick for the longest time.THEY were right, I was wrong.They make everything easier. When I travel, I army roll/ranger roll all my clothes then arrange them in the suitcase. With these, I can put t-shirts together, underwear and socks together, dressy clothes together, etc. PLUS I seem to be able to get even more clothes in a suitcase without cramming using these than without.Aside from organizing clothes before a trip, they come in handy during travels, so you can put dirty laundry in it's own bag to keep them from ruining clean clothes, as well as holding shoes, sandals, toiletries, cables and chargers, etc. They are the best for organizing things.I don't consider these to be flimsy or cheap at all. If you're looking to conserve space, you don't want added bulk or weight. They're strong enough to pack tightly, the zippers are strong, and the mesh top allows you to see what's inside each cube.I am a convert and now I never pack and travel without my packing cubes.",

I am a master at packing and had no idea how much I needed packing cubes in my life!There\u2019s nothing worse than having to use several packing bags because just one is too small\u2026 But at 12\u201d long, 9\u201d wide and 5\u201d deep, these are large enough for almost any of your needs (one guy on the plane looked like he could\u2019ve been carrying one of these as a carry-on)!These have a million uses but I find they make wonderful toiletry bags when you\u2019re traveling. One is large enough to hold all your toiletries, helping me to stay organized, without having to dig through my luggage to find what I\u2019m looking for. These can also hold your shoes, several outfits, electronics, and a ton more; and not just when you\u2019re traveling, but even at home. And the price, especially for these well-made bags, is a steal at $20 for a 4pk!Another great thing about them is the transparent mesh, allowing you to see what you have packed without having to open it up and fish around. It has a handle, double zippers and the material & stitchwork is of a high quality; they seem rugged enough to hold up for years.I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know about that packing cube life. I\u2019m mad no one told me I needed these\u2026 so I\u2019m telling you: get them. They\u2019re awesome.",
