Now, everything is neat and wrinkle free and easy to find without tearing my suitcase apart. The photos and description are a bit misleading, however. These cubes have no structure and the zippers and materials are very cheap. As long as you're ok with that, you should be pleased with these packing cubes. I have taken them on two trips so far and I love them. I ordered two sets, one for my husband and one for myself. My husband's came in the wrong color and the seller was going to make a return or refund very complicated, so we chose to keep them anyway.",

Instead of having everything in one suitcase, having shirts, night clothes, and under garments in one cube was helpful in keeping organized. The mesh did easily tear so I can probably get one more vacation out of them before they will become useless, but I hope to get 2 more trips out of them. Pretty decent for the price.",

I wasn't disappointed. The cubes are lightweight but quite strong, came in the perfect sizes and shapes for my needs, and did exactly what I needed them to do. I especially liked the toiletry organizer because it can hang from a hook and has plenty of capacious zipped compartments to organize my toiletries. These aren't compression cubes but I wasn't interested in that so no issues there. Highly recommended.",

I purchased the cubes to help me keep somewhat organized and allow me to have some \"privacy\" with my personal items.I really was amazed at how much these cubes hold, how neat and efficiently I was able to pack 14 days of clothing, and how much room was left in my suitcase after I put everything in it. I could have sized down from the large case to a medium size if I had only packed clothing.The quality of these cubes is quite good. They are made of a ripstop type of materal and mesh with the larger cubes having double ended zippers for easy access. They seem to be very well made and I really liked the hanging toiletry bag. While small and compact, I was able to fit all my toiletry items and makeup into caddy.I will be purchasing another set for my husband - he commented that this was one of my better \"gadget\" purchases and it really made a lot of sense to pack this way.",

                "reviewText": "I've had the opportunity to utilize the DIMJ Packing Cubes set, which includes 11 pieces designed for carry-on suitcase organization. After several trips and consistent use, here are my thoughts on this travel accessory.Firstly, the effectiveness of these packing cubes in maximizing suitcase space cannot be overstated. I've been pleasantly surprised by the additional items I can fit within my luggage thanks to these cubes. They have certainly made packing more efficient and have been instrumental in keeping my belongings organized and accessible while on the move.Upon reaching my destination, the convenience of these cubes shines. Transferring the cubes directly from suitcase to drawer simplifies the unpacking process remarkably, allowing me to settle in and start my trip without fuss.However, it's not all smooth sailing with the DIMJ Packing Cubes. The quality of the construction, particularly the straps within each cube, raises some concerns. I've found that the straps tend to rip or fray rather quickly, which calls into question the overall durability of the product. This flaw is a significant drawback, considering that the cubes are meant to withstand the demands of travel.While the price point is attractive, the quality issue suggests that there may be more robust options available on the market. It's worth noting that investing a little more initially could potentially save you from the inconvenience and additional cost of replacing subpar cubes.",
