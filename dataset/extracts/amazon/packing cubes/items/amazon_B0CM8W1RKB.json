            "Practical Double Zipper System - Unlike plastic vacuum bags, these compression cubes use a two-zip system to flatten your clothes, instantly saving up to 50% of space and keeping them wrinkle-free. Plus you don't have to spend as much effort emptying the air of the packing cubes for travel as you would with a vacuum bag, just zip it up and the compression is complete!",
            "Sock Tube and Wash Bag - Unlike most travel cubes for packing compression, we've included a sock tubular cube and a wash bag with a clear window. You no longer need to keep your socks with your other clothes, making it tidier and more efficiently organised. In addition, the clear window on the side of the toiletry bag allows you to enjoy a wider view when searching for your toiletries and find the right items faster.",
            "Premium Quality Fabric - The suitcase packing cubes are made of high quality nylon material. Although it is lightweight (a set: 1.5 lbs), it is durable enough. The smooth coated fabric is water resistant and will stop splashes. The compressed packing cubes are perfect when you want to reduce weight and save space in your carry-on luggage, suitcase or backpack.",
            "Sturdy - We see many people worry about the traveling cubes are not strong and the zip is poor quality. With improvements, our zips are very strong, smooth and durable. The handles and all seams of the packing squares are sewn tightly so they won't break easily because they are full, nor will the handles break because the clothes are too heavy. Every customer deserves the best quality!",
            "Stay Fashionable While Travelling - Are you unable to take multiple styles of clothing with you because of space constraints in your suitcase? The travel organizer will compress the volume of your clothing so more items can fit in the same space, allowing you to travel in style and be as stylish and elegant as possible!",
            "Quality Guarantee - DIMJ aims to provide high quality products and thoughtful service to every customers.If there are any quality problems during use, please do not hesitate to contact us for a satisfactory answer!"

                "reviewText": "The set is well made, with all zippers functional and all seams good. I really like the items packaged in this set. The cubes are all very useable sizes, the laundry bag is a little small, but good for weekender trips, and the toiletry is pretty decent to just dump toiletries in.I use packing cubes a lot when traveling, and I have both compression cubes (with the extra) and non-compression cubes (without the zipper). I can't say I prefer one over the other. The compression cubes make for easy pre-suitcase compression, but the non-compression cubes tend to just compress down and fill the gaps when you close your suitcase. Therefore, I don't see much difference in the total volume the suitcase can hold. I suspect it depends what you are packing. Probably the compression cubes help more with the bulkier items.The only thing I don't care for on these packing cubes is that the mesh fabric is a little stiff. It really doesn't make enough difference in the function to knock off a star for though.Just in general about packing cubes: They are really great for two scenarios. First, keeping your clothes organized when you have to live out of suitcase. It is kind of like having drawers in your suitcase for each type of clothing: shirts/shorts/underwear/etc. You can take the cubes out and lay them on the table and then quickly get them back in your suitcase when you need to pack up again. The second scenario is for when you are going on a multi-stage trip and don't want to unpack and repack your whole suitcase each stop. So for example you can put your clothes for day 1 and 2 in one cube, and only take that cube out of the suitcase at the first hotel. I've also used them around the house to store things.",

                "reviewText": "A great way to travel. Very convenient and organizing. You can put pants in one shirt and another and so forth. Comes with Plenty of bags to do so. The colors are nice and bags seem very sturdy Zipper seems well built. It is great for small carry-on luggage you can compact and fit so much. But if you\u2019re looking to use this for check in bags..be very careful because you can easily go overweight because of how compact these are, you will look into your bag and say \u201coh i still have so much more room \u201c you will be tempted to fill those spaces in your bag and when you go to weigh it, it will be overweight. Needless to say the compact bags work very well.",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with this set of compression travel cubes because I just returned from a week long cruise and used non-mesh compression cubes. I had to use adhesive labels on the cubes because I could not see what was inside. Now with these mesh fabric compression cubes, I can see what is inside. I like the sizes, however, it would have been better if a smaller compression cube was included instead 2 of the same size, 13.78\" x 9.84\".I like the functionality and availability of the compression feature if needed. Sometimes, I do not want to compress my clothes so tightly but still want to organize and save space in my luggage.All 7 pieces were packed inside the clear cosmetic case for delivery. However, I will not pack them inside the cosmetic case for storage.The all opaque drawstring fabric laundry bag is a nice feature because I used a similar type packing bag on my last cruise for doing laundry on the ship's self-serve laundromat. It is very useful for holding items that are needed for the trip but do not need essential identification.I will definitely be using these cubes on all my upcoming travels.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got these compressible packing cubes and couldn't be happier! The double zipper system is a game-changer, effortlessly saving up to 50% of space in my luggage while keeping my clothes wrinkle-free. The addition of a sock tube and wash bag with a clear window adds a level of organization that I didn't know I needed \u2013 no more searching for socks in the midst of my clothes.The premium quality nylon material is lightweight yet durable, making these cubes perfect for reducing weight in my carry-on or backpack. Worries about weak zips and poor quality handles are a thing of the past \u2013 the improvements are evident, with strong, smooth, and durable zippers and tightly sewn handles and seams.What sets these cubes apart is the ability to stay fashionable while traveling. The compression feature allows me to pack more items in the same space, letting me showcase multiple styles on my journey. DIMJ's commitment to quality is reassuring, and their customer service is top-notch. I highly recommend these packing cubes for anyone looking to travel in style and with ease.",

The set comes with 4 compression bags, a sock or undergarments bag, laundry bag, shoe bag, and toiletry bag with a clear see thru window. The set comes exactly as described. All the bags are very well made, sturdy, wipeable, waterproof, and have well made double zippers. When packing in the 4 compression bags you can save so much space in your luggage and it keeps all your items neat and organized. Also when not using all the bags fit nicely in the toiletry bag for easy storage. I am very pleased with this set and definitely recommend for travel. These would also make a very nice gift. I will definitely be purchasing more for the others members of my family so we can all have a set when we travel.",
