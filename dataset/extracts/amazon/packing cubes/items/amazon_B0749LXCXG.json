The material is nice and sturdy (but light), good stitching, YKK zippers with nice pulls, and vibrant colors (which are good for visibility in a dark bag). They are a tad smaller than some cubes, but I actually like that. Most other cubes can be hard to fill, which makes them floppy; these keep everything nice and tight while still having enough room. For reference: I used one small for undies, the other small for socks; one medium for rolled-up tees, the other medium for rolled-up pants; the large for bulkier items that need folding (like collared shirts, sweatshirts, etc). Everything was snug, but not stuffed, and easy to Tetris into my bag. You could do a week of everything in these, which is the max a person should ever pack anyway. I\u2019d definitely buy again, which I can\u2019t say for any other cheap cubes.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to try them for a weekend trip. We were flying carry-on only and I thought it could be a great way to not have to worry about random articles of clothing finding their way out of the bag as we were traveling. Out of the package they didn't have any odd odors, always a plus. At a first look the zippers seemed sturdy and the seams well done. I wasn't planning on using these to try and compress my clothing, that's not really this product's intended purpose, and so far they've held up great. They made organizing my clothes a breeze. I was able to get items out of my bag at the airport without fear of showing the world any unmentionables or losing a random sock. Once at our destination it made unpacking super easy. I could set them out and pull only what I needed as I needed it. Repacking them was just as smooth. If you asked me if they saved me any room in my bag, my answer would be not really. But again, I was looking more for organization, and for that they 100% hit the mark. In fact, my husband stole a couple on our most recent trip, so it looks like we may be buying a second set.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased packing cubes and I must say that I\u2019m quite satisfied with them. While they didn\u2019t help me save much space, they did help me organize my clothes and made it easier to access them. I usually roll my clothes, and rolling them into the cubes didn\u2019t really give me much extra space. However, when it came to organizing and pulling out the clothes, it helped immensely. I could easily get socks, underwear, t-shirts, or pants without disturbing the rest of the luggage.I was living out of a suitcase for a while, changing hotels every day, so not having to unpack and repack every night was a game changer! The packing cubes made it easy to keep my clothes organized and accessible, which saved me a lot of time and hassle.Overall, I would recommend packing cubes to anyone who wants to stay organized while traveling. They may not help you save space, but they will definitely make your life easier when it comes to packing and unpacking your luggage.",
