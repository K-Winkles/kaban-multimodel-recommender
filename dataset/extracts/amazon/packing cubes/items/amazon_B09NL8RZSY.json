                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Ridiculous capacity",
                "reviewText": "I recently used the larger packing cube for a short weekend trip, I was able to fit so much into the large cube, I didn't even get to use the smaller cube. I packed: four underwear, five shorts (one gym short, one swim trunk, and three regular shorts), five t-shirts, and three pair of socks in the large cube. The pack swallowed it all and compressed without the slightest hint of fussing - I think I could have put a bit more in the pack, to be honest. The gussets on the corners of the cube are a fantastic add and really go a long way to making the closure/compression process easy as pie. The clamshell opening makes packing a snap, whether you roll or flat-fold your clothing. The zips are big and chunky and provide confidence that they won't pop open, should you get a little overzealous with your packing. They're also pretty sharp looking, in typical Thule fashion. The semi-transparent material isn't a bother to me, but I can see how it would bother some folks. It certainly makes identifying your contents easier, especially if you share packing cubes and luggage.Compared to my Tripped packing cubes, these are miles better. They're way more expensive, but I'd say worth it. The design of the Thule packs are far better. The clamshell opening makes for easier packing versus the 3/4 zip of the Tripped cubes. The Tripped cubes also do not have any gusseting, so compressing the cube is much more of a fuss, when you're at the capacity limit. Once you do get the Tripped cube compressed, it's just the edges that are compressed and the center of the cube is bulging, because all the contents have been mushed to the center, so the compression zips can close. So, yes, it's \"compressed,\" but the pack is bulging in the middle so it's kind of worthless. The Tripped cubes are marginally lighter, but not noticeable.All-in-all, these are absolutely fantastic cubes and hold considerably more than they look like they would. A solid purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I have never used packing cubes but was getting holes in my clothing from items shifting around during transports. These cubes hold a huge amount of clothing and appear very sturdy, easy to use as they unzip all the way. I also bought cheaper plastic compression bags but they are much more difficult to use. Expensive compared to other options but IMO well worth it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Stronger than cheaper versions. More structured than Eagle Creek",
                "reviewText": "I have a couple of cheaper brand compression cubes including Gonex and Suited Nomad (both of which are of similar quality) but the Thule one is much stronger as it ought to be at the higher price point. The zippers are quality items too and zip easily. I also own Eagle Creek Spectre compression cubes and the big difference between them and the Thule is that the Thule is more structured and made of a heavier weight fabric. I consider Thule and Eagle Creek are the best brands that are readily available and are similarly well made and strong but the Thule feels like it will last forever but it is heavier if this matters.. The Eagle Creek will undoubtedly last too but i feel its like comparing a winter weight jacket with a summer weight one.If you're not familiar with packing cubes and compression ones in particular they are an efficient means of packing so that you can put things like underwear, socks and shirts etc in cubes which makes it easy if you are moving around. Whilst you can cram stuff into them unless they are fairly stiff material you are not going to gain much extra storage. Now compression offers a further refinement in taking a standard cube and by using a zipper around the middle of the bag to compress the items within and save more space. When some people say the compression doesn't help much they are invariably trying to compress items that won't squish down like cotton button-up shirts or shorts but if you use them to compress soft materials like t-shirts or sweatshirts they work really well. An obvious point but the weight will not change with compression!",

                "reviewText": "I am a bit obsessed with packing cubes and have tried many. All the others were a waste of my money after having used these. I purchased these for a week long trip where I wanted to bring a lot of options as I had a wedding to attend, and I wasn't sure of the weather. I could not believe how much I could fit into each cube (I purchased 2 different sizes). My suitcase was completely organized and transformed, I am astonished how much I could fit in them. The fabric and zippers seem to be super durable, and the double zipper for compressing things seems to really work. I had mch more empty space / leftover room for shoes and other items. Also, I always worry about my luggage being lost, especially if I have packed some pricey clothing items - I filled a bag with essentials and items to wear at the wedding and popped it into my carry-on bag (fit very nicely with the compression and still had plenty of room for other carry-on items I needed in my tote) - I had more than enough clothing to get by in the event my luggage went missing, which gave me peace of mind! I highly recommend this brand - don't waste your money on cheaper options - you will get way more into one of these bags than other options, and the quality is far superior to some of the other ones I have tried in the past.",
