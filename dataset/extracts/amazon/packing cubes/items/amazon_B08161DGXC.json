                "reviewText": "Last month, I purchased four medium and four small Dot&Dot packing cubes before taking a month long trip. Packing and traveling will never be the same anymore! I used to agonize over packing, layering my clothes to reduce wrinkles and using a multitude of Ziploc bags for personal care items. Then, when I arrived at my destination, I invariably would have to hang up all my clothes to get the one item I needed, or yank it out of the pile and end up wrinkling everything else. Finding toothpaste or deodorant meant looking through way too many plastic bags that were in nooks and crannies all around the suitcase. My Dot&Dot cubes solved these problems and even more - and I waited until after my return trip to write my review to ensure I wouldn't end up changing my mind. Her are some of my favorite features:* I was able to reuse the plastic storage bag they came in. I put craft supplies in one and small gifts for my grandson in the other. The plastic zipper on one broke immediately, which was disappointing, but not a deal breaker.* I was able to choose my favorite color (red), which wasn't critical, but it was fun to have everything look so unified.* Since the zipper runs around 3 of the four sides, I was able to lay the cubes open while arranging my clothes and have easy access to take out one item while leaving the others in place until needed. Dual zippers made it simple to open at any desired location and there are no loose threads or seams to catch in the zippers.* The mesh cover allows clothing to \"breathe,\" which is important when I've traveled to warm locations. There have been times when I've arrived at my destination and discovered that the temperature differential between the plane's cold cargo hold and my location's temperature had caused condensation in my luggage and clothes that felt slightly damp. No problem on my last trip.* The packing cubes made it easy to organize and they hold an unbelievable amount. In the medium cubes, I needed to pack clothes for moderate and hot weather. I was able to fit six long-sleeved shirts and two pairs of pants in one, all my shorts in another with room to spare, sweaters and sweatshirts in a third, and short-sleeved and sleeveless tops in the fourth. (I usually wear large sized clothing and nothing skimpy.) Two small cubes held all my undergarments, socks and bathing suits. The other two had my personal care items. I still used plastic bags in case of leaks, but everything stayed put and it was easy to find and remove what was needed.* Perhaps best of all was that I could take out what I needed when I wanted to and leave the rest in place. I simply placed the cubes with the rest of my clothes in the bottom of the closet and left them there. When packing, I rolled up each item to make this really easy and that also helped prevent wrinkles. I actually ended up not needing or unpacking most of my long-sleeved tops while on my trip. I took one out this morning - one month later - and it was as fresh and wrinkle-free as a month ago!My daughter and son-in-law, who travel frequently with their infant (and are definitely challenged in the skills of packing) took one look at my Dot&Dot cube system and immediately ordered some for their packing needs! My only wish is that they would make the cubes with a small clear pocket on the top (like the ones you find on suitcases for ID information) for labeling. Even though the mesh makes it easier to see inside, I ended up making labels (e.g. \"sweaters and sweatshirts\") for mine and placed them under the mesh, but they didn't stay in place.I'll be ordering a few more packing cubes for my next trip to accommodate some dressier items. I look forward to being able to pack ahead of time without my usual last minute anxiety about how to arrange my belongings or forgetting important items - not to mention cluttering up the bed in our guestroom with layers of spread out clothing.",

                "reviewText": "I traveled in Italy for 4 weeks this fall. These packing cubes were great for keeping my clothing items separate and keeping my suitcase neat the whole time. I liked the different sizes which gave me options. Shirts, pants, underwear, sweaters were all in their own cubes. Another member of my family who only traveled for 10 days used his own set to separate complete outfits. Hiking clothing in one . Going out to dinner clothes in another. Worked great. These packing cubes really don\u2019t save space, compression bags work better for that. I used both. I will definitely use these again for traveling.",

                "reviewText": "I travel a great deal on business (mostly internationally) and prize being efficient with my packing and unpacking. This applies both at home as I prepare to fly and then when I get to a hotel at the end of a long flight. I've always rolled my clothing and packed it into the various crannies inside my suitcase around shoes and other incompressible objects. The problem with this is that it means I have to unpack everything once I reach my destination and have a lot of loose items lying around. Nevertheless, I've used this system for years.I was recently about to embark a trip that spanned four cities over two weeks ranging from cold wintertime in the U.K. to the Middle East to midsummer in the Southern Hemisphere. I wanted to be able to unpack in modules... cold-weather clothing only during the first week and then warm-weather apparel the second. After some research I decided to try these Dot&Dot small packing cubes. The bottom line after this grueling two-week journey is that I'm now hooked on them and can't imagine flying without them.First of all, they're fairly basic things. The nylon, zipper and mesh seem sturdy. When empty they're basically flat. I was able to roll up four dress shirts and pack them in one cube with handkerchiefs placed on top of them. Underwear and socks fit in another cube with my pajamas. Summer casual shirts and rolled-up casual trousers fit in another one. My gym clothes and a scarf and gloves went in the fourth.I was delighted with this system. The first week, in cold Istanbul and London, I left the summer stuff in its cube in my suitcase. The second week, in Dubai and South Africa, I left the winter clothing in its cube. When I checked into a hotel I didn't even unpack the cubes I would use while there. I just tossed them into the dresser drawer, unzipped them and used them when needed. When I got clothes laundered, I just rolled them up and put them back in the cube. When I was ready to check out I zipped them up and packed them. This not only saved me precious time and energy (it's as annoying to unpack clothing in a strange hotel at the end of a long transatlantic flight as it is to pack while checking out and heading to the airport) but saved me keeping track of random clothing items and minimized the chance I'd leave them behind.Time will tell how well the cubes themselves wear. It's not as though I'll subject them to much wear, however. They either sit compressed within my suitcase or in a hotel dresser. In my continual quest to travel in as organized, efficient and easy manner as possible these travel cubes are an important and welcome addition to my routine.As for the size I'm very happy with the small cubes. I use a vacuum-sealed bag for my suits; otherwise, the medium or large Dot&Dot cubes might be useful for those. I heartily endorse these, however. I bought a Dot&Dot dopp kit (toiletry bag), too, and reviewed that one separately. This company apparently makes good products.UPDATE: I reviewed these packing cubes immediately after buying them in Feb. 2015 and taking them on a long trip. It's more than three years later and I still endorse them heartily. I travel 12-15 weeks per year, mostly internationally. The ability to plop these things in a hotel room dresser drawer, not unpack them, and dip into them daily to get clothing I need makes managing packing and unpacking so much more efficient. And they've worn beautifully. I snagged the mesh cover on something early on and it got a small tear, which has never spread. And the other cubes are unblemished. Amazing for the amount of use they've gotten. An excellent product.",
