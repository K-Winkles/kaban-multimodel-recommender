                "reviewText": "Compression bags have one zipper to close the bag and another zipper that zips the top and bottom edges of the bag more tightly together, reducing the height of the bag. Like other packing cubes, compression bags help keep luggage organized, but they also offer the possibility of shrinking your overstuffed luggage contents. This is only partially true. Compression bags can\u2019t work miracles: if the clothes are already tightly rolled, they won\u2019t compress much more, and it may not be possible to flatten them enough to fully zip the compression zipper all the way around. On the other hand, a bulky puffy coat can be stuffed into a much smaller compression bag (see photos). The bags also don\u2019t compress uniformly but tend to compress the outer edges more than the middle. As a trip progresses and clothes move out of luggage and into a laundry bag, the compression bags should be able to compress the remaining clothes and one of the compression bags can be dedicated to laundry so that it can also be compressed.I was able to fit 14 rolled women\u2019s T-shirts in one of the medium-sized bags but could only zip the compression zipper about 3/4 of the way around. The zippers seem strong despite not carrying a recognized brand name. The \u201cbrown\u201d color might also be described as a more attractive copper color. I like that the bags open on the long side, unlike the bag I already own, although this design might not allow for as much compression. These bags are useful to me for organizing and managing the shifting contents of my luggage.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a travel gadget fanatic and I was excited to see how the Doxerfit compression cubes could help me with my travel packing. The first thing I noticed about the Doxerfit cubes is the color: it's kind of a copper/burnt sienna rust, which is pretty unique. There are 4 bags of different sizes; for some reason I had been expecting the usual 1 small/2 medium/1 large combination. However, this set has 1 each of S, M, L, and XL. The L is more of a square while the XL is a rectangle. Note that the inner seams are taped, which will prevent frayed edges and possible split seams. The mesh is double-weave and holes are small, which makes it stronger.I put these packing cubes under a few rigorous stress tests, and they held up great.In the first photos are the size S bag, which I filled with 4 thick wool boot socks, 5 pairs of low-cut socks, 1 thick bra, 7 pairs of underwear, and one cotton t-shirt. I wanted to push this bag to the limit to see what it could do for me.I then tried the XL bag. I rolled a size L down parka into a plastic bag, squeezed out some air, and fastened it with 3 elastic bands. I did the same with a M down vest, in a smaller plastic bag. I thought these 2 items wouldn't leave any more room in the compression bag, but there was space, so I added another M down vest. Still there was space available, so I added a fleece scarf and some fleece gloves. To my amazement, I was able to compress the entire bag. The photos show the final results.These bags were under a lot of pressure, and I was concerned these bags would split at the seams, but they did not. Other reviews have pointed out that compression bags bulge in the middle; which is true. However, that can be used as an advantage when packing: in the suitcase, where the compression bag becomes thinner, are the nooks and crannies that can be filled with shoes, umbrellas, belts and other irregular-sized objects.I'm impressed with these bags and would recommend them to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I discovered the joys of various kinds of travel pouches several years ago, but most of mine don't have this compression feature. I really like it! I am all for stuffing things as tight as possible and worrying about wrinkles later. This set of 4 pouches is versatile and practical for about everything soft that goes in my suitcase. I also like being able to pop the pouch in the drawer at the hotel and not really unpack. Items come out of one pouch, are worn, and then go into the pouch I have designated for laundry. When I am ready to leave, I just rezip and compress.They are well made with both good fabric and zipper quality. I like the color. It is pretty and unusual. I am so over black! If you want to be better organized, I highly recommend! And if you don't travel that often, you could use them at home for storing out of season stuff, sheets, etc.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this set of compression bags to help me pack more efficiently for my travels. I find the compression feature is very useful for reducing the volume of bulky items like sweaters, jackets, or towels. You just fill the bag with clothes, close the top zipper, and then squeeze out the air and compress the bag with the side zipper.However, I found that you can\u2019t pack the bags all the way to the top, because it becomes too difficult to close the zipper and the bag bulge in the middle. I had to leave some space at the top to make sure the zipper could move smoothly and the bag could fit in my suitcase. Also, if you compress the bags too much, your clothes get scrunched up. So, I preferred to use the bags as regular packing cubes for some of my clothes, and only compress the ones that I didn\u2019t mind getting wrinkled.The 2-in-1 bag is a nice bonus, as it keeps your shoes or dirty clothes separate from the rest of your stuff. The bags are also better than rolling plastic bags where you have to unpack everything to get something on the bottom.Overall, They are durable, versatile, and convenient. They help me pack more clothes in less space, and keep them organized and neat.",
