                "reviewText": "I bought 2 sets of these compression packing cubes. This is my 1st time using such a thing.Quality-wise, the plastic used is good; it's not the flimsy type. The mesh is not really a mesh but it does have very tiny holes on it; I could see individual fur from my winter jacket poking through it. This means the cubes are also breathable. Once, I got the plastic stuck in the zipper but it didn't get torn off; there's no holes on it either after I successfully removed it from the zipper. The zippers themselves are strong & can hold the compressed cubes quite well even though they're plastic. There's a handle on each cube for you to carry it individually. I wouldn't recommend doing that on a long-term basis coz the handle is only on 1 side of it so the weight of the cube will not be equally distributed.I pack my cubes to the brim so there's not much difference in size before & after compression. For those that still has space for compression, I'll compress it so that my items don't move around in it. Plus, it's more stable that way when I put it into the luggage as it'll be as solid as a rock. For those that are too tight to be compressed, I just leave it be. I don't want to put too much pressure on the zippers & risk destroying them in the long run. I kinda like it that I have a choice to compress it or not based on my needs.After packing all my stuffs in these compression packing cubes, I still have half to a third of empty space in my 31-inch luggage. The 2 largest cubes in my luggage will be carried separately by hand so that leaves me nearly half of the luggage empty. I'm quite surprised with the result. This is for an 8-day trip, & would've been filled up to the max if I hadn't used the cubes.Overall, these cubes are a life-changer for me. I would definitely recommend the use of it - plus, this brand - to other people. Thank you, Alameda!",
