However I have 5 kids and I'm not wanting to buy everyone new suitcases right now. These are the perfection solution. They are lightweight but durable and it is very easy to pack each individual one and pop them into the suitcase, or put them in the empty suitcase, fill them up, then zip them closed. They make the suitcase have compartments if they aren't already built in, and keep items separated and organized. I also love it for keeping dirty clothes separate at the end of the trip.They also all fit into each other when empty so they don't take up much room at all",

                "reviewText": "Got these tonight! I have tons of bags for all sort of things and I would say the material quality is pretty good, but it is also the really lightweight material we find in the drawstring backpacks. The stiching and the closures are all higher quality done so they should last longer. The see thru areas are a mesh material. Of course this allows for your clothes or items to breathe and stay fresh or closer to it. They all roll up into the small travel bag. Super easy to keep together and store!Cons: they are not as deep as the picture shows more like 2 to 2.5 inches deep. However, packing small and medium suitcases these would be perfect. I took pictures of what all came in the 8 piece set. If there was 1 or two larger bags I would say it would easily be great for a larger suitcase.",

First bag I unzipped the zipper literally came unstitched from the bag. Second bag I tried did the same thing. The stitches just come apart. The bag is super thin and can\u2019t hold. I ended up packing their tiny clothes socks etc in the suit case and when I opened it everything was everywhere. Hate it them! Won\u2019t be buying again.",
