They\u2019re cute and the different sizes are wonderful, and they pack very nicely. The straps in the larger bags are great for organizing. I folded my 2 fancier items and a light jacket and strapped them in the bottom of the medium cube, and put my regular clothes on top. I didn\u2019t have to dig for anything and it was really easy to find what I needed for the day. The shoe bag is great and it expands. I\u2019m a size 8 US women\u2019s shoe, and I could fit a pair of tennis shoes, a pair of converse, and 2 sandals into the bag. Honestly, the only things really missing from this set is sizable laundry bag (though I used the larger zippered bag for my dirty shirts and intimates and it was totally workable) and the quality of the fabric was a little cheap. My largest cube came with a small tear in the side of the mesh, but it didn\u2019t affect the function at all and it was super easy for me to repair with a sewing kit. Overall, highly useful items and it came in my favorite color, so I\u2019m more than pleased with what I got for the price.",

                "reviewText": "These cubes made our packing lives so much easier! I was able to coordinate my girls\u2019 clothing by color of these cubes, and all their outfits for an 8 day road trip (granted we washed clothes during the trip), were able to fit neatly in these cubes. The cubes then fit in a regular sized backpack for each girl. There was room to spare in the backpacks, which left plenty of room for 2 cubes per kid, their snacks, games, and other activities! Great purchase! These are kind of flimsy, so I\u2019m not sure how long they\u2019ll last, but the price wasn\u2019t bad.",
