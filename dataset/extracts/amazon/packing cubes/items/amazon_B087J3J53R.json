I use these pouches all the time for traveling and they've been with me on about a dozen domestic and international trips in the last few years with no issues or rips. The zippers are sturdy and pouches have a good amount of stretch for holding many items! These pouches do not \"compress\" the way other travel pouches do, which is fine with me. I like the mesh panel so I can see what is inside each of the bags. I tend to use the smallest of the bags for electronics or cords - it's otherwise too small for more than a couple of pairs of socks or similar.",

                "reviewText": "Before heading to Europe last year I decided to research some packing cubes and found these to be highly rated. My friend and I decided to travel with only one carry on bag each for a two week trip.These really did the trick. I had no interest in having to wash clothes while on the trip. With these I was able to roll up pants and tops and squeeze lots of them into the cubes. The smallest one was perfect for t-shirts, socks, and underwear. You can fit A LOT of clothes into these and then zip them up.Once there, I could take out the cubes and put them on the hotel shelves or in drawers, taking things out as I needed them. The price was also very good. There are more expensive ones, but I found these to be just what I needed.In addition, I like the fact that they are lightweight and very flexible. And the golden yellow color is just simply cheerful and fun.",
