When my fiance and I decided to have a destination wedding followed immediately by a honeymoon outside the country I knew that I would need to get serious about my packing organization. I was so excited to use these and was not disappointed. I think the term \"compression\" is maybe too strong a word, but they do condense a bit. Essentially they have an extra zipper to close the bags tighter and eliminate looseness in the bag, which is not what I think of when I think compression, I think more of an airtight bag with a valve to push air out until it's essentially vaccum sealed. So if that's what you're looking for, this is not it. But I do find these really helpful for organizing categories of clothes using the images pictured on each bag, and it does compact clothes down more than just placing clothes directly into the suitcase. It also makes unpacking and re-packing easier. I do really like these bags and am happy to add them to my travel gear.",

                "reviewText": "I recently took a 2 week family trip to Hawai'i. I needed clothes for hiking and nice dinners so I had to be strategic in my packing. These cubes were really the best for keeping like things together- one for PJs, one for swimwear, one for outdoor clothes, etc. As we moved between several islands it was easy to layer the cubes in and out of my suitcase as I needed them.I don't think I saved much space on the \"compression\" side. Yes, they zipped up and made tighter bundles but the way the fabric just moved from the edges to the center of the cube didn't displace much total volume. Still, these cubes made a long trip easy to stay organized and that is quite the feat in travel!",

                "reviewText": "I like the sizes of these bags , that the set has six bags and the images on each bag of what clothing is appropriate or suggested. I have the black set. I like that the mesh allows me to see some of the contents and lets the clothes to breathe. The zippers are short but appear to be strong and they have zipper pulls that are easy to use. I really stuffed these bags and had to push hard to get them to close and zip and they held up very well. I recommend this set. They save space and the help organize your items and contains them in the suitcase and the hotel.",

                "reviewText": "At first, I was disappointed at the size of the laundry bag. I was like... there is no way this is going to hold all my laundry that I packed. And then I realized, it would as long as I put all my dirty clothes in the compressors first. I see that as a drawback because I was planning and still plan to keep my clean clothes in the compressors until the end of my trip. I also plan to put all my dirty clothes in a laundry bag each day after wearing them. So... slight issue here. Either I have to unpack EVERYTHING and then put dirty clothes in the compressors and then put that in my dirty clothes bag OR I need to have a pile of dirty clothes in my hotel or cruise room. \ud83d\ude12I am opting to use a larger laundry bag.However, outside of that glitch, I love this set!! I already tested washing them in washing machines on high heat and drying them in electric dryers on low heat. No issues. I love the shoe bag. I will be making great use of that. When I first saw the set, I was like this is not going to hold all my socks and such. But after unzipping it, I am convinced it will meet all my travel packing needs..Great set overall. Just wish they put more thought into the laundry bag sizing.",

                "reviewText": "I picked these up prior to a trip my wife and I had to new orleans. We travel light and each only carry a backpack when we take tripes. We had the non-compression style cubes that we always used and which worked well, but we still had to stuff the clothes into the bags. With these, the clothes were already really compressed and we were able to pack more efficiently.The way these compression cubes work is that you fill them with clothes and then there is a second zipped to collapse the sides and hold them closed. I packed several of these and with the aid of a knee to push the clothes down and a hand to keep them inside the cube, I was able to zip these up and reduce the size by quite a bit.Despite being called a six piece set, only four of the bags are compressible via the second zipper. There is a laundry bag, which was useful on the trip and gave us a place to stash our dirty clothes before we had to pack up for the trip home. There is also a shoe bag which we didn't find a real use for, though some may like this to keep shoes they pack from rubbing against clean clothes, so I get it. Just know that you are getting four compression cubes and 2 other bags.The sizes are varied. i sue the smalled for socks and underwear and we put everything else in the others.Overall I think these cubes are a new travel essential when trying to pack for a whole trip in a small bag.",

I ended up only taking a duffle bag because what I needed was able to fit in there. I think I probably expected them to compress more, but I liked how they worked. They are lightweight, but still seem durable. The zippers seem strong and like they will hold.",

                "reviewText": "The material used for these bags reminds me almost like a windbreaker material. It is fairly sturdy for what it is but I imagine if you way overpacked these often they would eventually rip. They are actually very spacious. If you overfill them and aren't able to compress them, they still save quite a bit of space-- plus everything is nice and organized in your bag. There are many bags for different purposes, and I particularly like the little drawstring bag which could be used for dirty laundry. Very handy!",
