So I can\u2019t fit as much in them because I have to fold or roll garments tighter than for my other brand. The zipper compression is great. I was able to put one pair of jeans, one pair of sweatpants, 2 knit tops, and one sweatshirt in the largest cube and compress it down. I could have fit mor without compressing.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used packing cubes for years and wouldn\u2019t travel without them. Not only is it easier to keep different clothing articles sorted (I know exactly where to find a specific pair of pants, underwear or shirt), but when there is a shortage of drawer space, I can use the cubes to stay organized instead. On a recent cruise, we had upgraded to a better cabin, then were dismayed to realize it only had two drawers. By using my cubes, I was able to offer both of the drawers to my husband.So why did I need these? I\u2019m really hoping to entice hubby into trying them and these aren\u2019t in a feminine color. In addition to color, I like using cubes with a see-through panel, which these have. These even have a clear pocket on top of each to add a label to identify contents. I also like that these are compression cubes. I\u2019ve traveled when my non-compression cubes were half filled and they generally got crumpled in my luggage during travel. The compression feature will be a nice upgrade.This set includes 7 bags as well as a small bag of empty bottles for lotions, shampoo, etc. Among the bags, there is a huge one for shoes (I could put two pair in here!) and another is a drawstring laundry bag that has an exterior pocket and even has straps to carry it as a backpack. While most of the bags have the mesh see-through panel, there is also one solid black bag, without the mesh, that has multiple compartments on the inside. Very handy!I\u2019ll admit that when this set arrived, the small package felt unusually heavy, a big factor when staying under that 50 lb. limit when traveling by air. All of these bags together weigh 1.8lb, heavier than my old cubes probably because of the extra zippers, but it is rare that I would be using all 7 bags at once. I typically use one for pants, one for casual tops, one for dressier/dinner tops, and a smaller one for underwear/sleepwear/socks. So if my husband uses the other 2 or 3, the weight of the bags would be cut in half for each suitcase. Each cube has a handy little handle on the short side. On the negative side, these cubes are smaller than I\u2019m accustomed to. With my old cubes, I\u2019m able to fold my pants into thirds, which is the perfect width of the cube, then place two stacks of pants side by side. The largest of these cubes isn\u2019t nearly large enough to do this. I\u2019ll probably continue to use my old one for pants, then these new cubes for other items.I always try to offer some suggestion for improvement when leaving reviews. The only thing I\u2019d recommend for these cubes would be to make the pull cords on the zippers different colors. I\u2019d leave the primary zippers the existing gray color, but would make the compression zipper pulls black. This way, one could tell at a glance which was which. However, the primary zipper has two-way zippers so there are two gray pull-cords together. The compression zipper is a solo pull, so this is how I\u2019ll be identifying which zipper does what. No real negative here, just trying to be thorough.Great cubes, but on the small size\u2026Four Stars.I hope you found this review to be helpful. Thanks for reading!!",

                "reviewText": "I have been traveling with packing cubes for years now, and the compression style bags are by far my favorite. These are the best for storing and organizing your clothes without the extra bulk that comes with nature of folded clothes. My friend suggested that I roll my clothes instead of folding them with compression cubes. The theory is that you can compress a rolled shirt better than a folded shirt.These cubes are well designed, look good, and fit my luggage very well. There is an extra bonus of the label pocket and a stack of ready to go labels. If you're traveling for a long time, you can label your clothes by day, event, or category. I've found that this is extremely helpful for times when I'm attending a conference and want to keep certain outfits separated from the rest of my clothes.",

They are also a great value, with three standard cubes [small, medium and large], small and large duffle-type bags [for shoes and laundry] and another cube with internal pockets for unmentionables.The compression component works well to reduce space of folded items allowing more room in your luggage. The zippers and drawstring closures are made with quality and work easily. The netted portions of the cubes allow you to see the contents without opening the bags and there are even pockets sized perfectly for ID labels. The four TSA-approved containers are a nice added touch for an already great product package.",

I prefer my silicone ones I got at the store. I didn't really like the non-compression bags they threw in there for free, seemed more like an attempt to provide more products, but with less of a good effort at design.",
