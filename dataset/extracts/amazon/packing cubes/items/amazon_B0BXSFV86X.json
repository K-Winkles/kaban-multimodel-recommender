A few times I overpacked them and the zippers took the tension well. The compression comes in handy when you don't have a lot of space but I've also used them several times just for organization while traveling and not necessarily needing the compression. The beige is nice and matched with everything. I will not be traveling without these! would purchase these again.",

The only negative is that the dirty laundry bag isn't really big enough to hold dirty clothes, but makes a perfect sized bag to throw a few pair of shoes into. It's a great value, at least at the price I paid.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I'm glad I bought these for a recent trip overseas. They kept my clothes organized and did provide a bit more room in the suitcase. But, one of the zippers broke almost immediately (I may have over stuffed the cube). And I would say the compression is moderate, not huge. However, I did also use some of those \"true compression\" plastic packing bags, and those were a bit more hard, blocky, and awkward to fit in the suitcase. So in the end I preferred these even though the compression wasn't as good.",

                "reviewText": "Packing is now much more organized within my carryon-shirts, socks, pants, etc can be grouped together and I know where they all go in which cube when I need to repack at the end of my trip. I am also not worried if for some reason I have to open my carryon during tsa inspections-I know that everything will fit, strangers won\u2019t be looking at my clothes and it will quickly and neatly go back in the case without loosing anything. These particular cubes seem decent they have so far held up on three different long trips so far where I have stuffed them to the hilt. No sign of wear and tear yet-I can tell they should last me for at least a couple of years of regular traveling. I have a history of overpacking so these were a game changer for me-you must be decisive of what you bring-a suitcase can only hold so much and since these cubes compress my clothes, I can still bring that extra sweatshirt for just in case. I really like these and the dark color matches my suitcase. You can slightly see through the mesh which I like so you can tell slightly what you put in there and there is one blacked out one for unmentionables-again which is great-I can\u2019t stand having my underwear jumbled up in my regular clothes-especially when traveling with others. My biggest advice when trying to get more clothes in a cube than you probably should-is to go slow when zipping them up. It will take a bit of time and you might need to use your body weight and a bit of finagling to help compress them. I have tried rolling vs folding shirts and it doesn\u2019t make a difference. Just go slow and they work fantastic.",

The amount of stuff these bags can hold is mind-blowing, and the zippers? Super strong. gave out on me, even when I think i was pushing the limits of packing.Besides the space-saving magic, these bags are like organizational heros. Everything stays neatly packed, and it's a lifesaver when I'm trying to find something specific without unpacking my whole suitcase. I honestly wish I had discovered these gems sooner. Oh, and can we talk about the color? Super cute! It adds a fun touch to my otherwise ordinary packing routine. If you're debating getting these travel compression bags, just do it. You won't regret it!",
