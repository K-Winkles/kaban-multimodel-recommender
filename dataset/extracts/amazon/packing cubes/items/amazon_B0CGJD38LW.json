                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice set of packing cubes",
                "reviewText": "This is a very versatile set of eight packing cubes. It contains three larger cubes for clothing, each with a mesh front for breathability and visibility, a smaller bag for underwear, a shoe bag, a drawstring bag, a sock bag, and a cosmetic bag.All of the bags fold up and fit nicely into the cosmetic bag. And I was able to easily fit them back in the cosmetic bag after taking everything out. So that's great for storage when not in use.The bags appear to be well made of a lightweight material. They all have handles and double zippers, except for the drawstring bag and the sock bag. The largest bag has straps inside that buckle over your clothes. And the shoe bag has a mesh pocket inside. The zippers seem to work well, except I had a little trouble getting them started. I got the black bags, and the handles and trim are black and not brown as pictured, as other reviewers have noted. No big deal.I think this set will be very useful for travel although I have not had the opportunity to use them yet. However I am a big person with big size clothing, and I'm sure that I will not be able to fit as much into the cubes as they claim. For example, they say you can fit four pairs of pants into the smallest of the three mesh cubes. And I'm guessing I could probably fit two pairs of pants in that. And they say you could fit 15 shirts in the middle sized mesh cube. Again I probably could fit about half of that. And the smallest bag that they call a sock bag is probably good for little incidentals, but it would only hold one or two pairs of my socks. Also the cosmetic bag has some mesh pockets for small bottles, and one panel that attaches with velcro and can be pulled out. It's enough to hold some small travel cosmetics but it wouldn't take the place of my usual cosmetic bag which holds a lot more. But it might be good for holding some small items in your carry-on.All in all I think this is a great set for organizing the things I need to pack when I travel. I just think the cubes will not hold as much as advertised, but they still will be very helpful.",

We are in the process of replacing some of his and this set had a great selection of sizes and is of great quality. He does not like the cubes that compress and these do not do that. If that is a feature you are looking for then I would look at different ones. These also have some cubes that don't have mesh fabric so the clothes are completely covered. He likes that for international travel when goodness knows who has checked your bag in the airport between stops. These are a great way to organize your clothes for different days or make sure that you have enough tops, pants, etc. We both love using travel cubes to pack!",

It worked out great and kept everything organized and mess free! I love the included laundry bag. These made packing up after our trip a breeze and stress free. I would 100% recommend these if you are going on a long or short trip.",

                "reviewText": "What I received was not exactly as pictured as these do not have a faux leather/brown handle or drawstring. However, these are nice packing squares and so many options with this set. There are 3 solid black bags, 3 mesh bags (all 6 bags of varying sizes) drawstring bag, 1 zipper pouch and a solid standalone divider with mesh pockets. Note: All of the squares are soft shelled so will not necessarily protect items from being pushed down on. The zippers are easy to zip. The bags are light weight, good quality and easy to clean. The larger bag can tie down personal items to itself. The best thing of all is every single bag/pouch folds and zips inside one of the smallest bags, so when not in use, this kit takes up very little space and can be thrown in a suitcase to store for next time! Great purchase and would make a nice gift for someone that travels a lot. I also plan to use a couple to organize a toy room (I put puzzles/games in a couple of the mesh bags), household supplies, etc.",
