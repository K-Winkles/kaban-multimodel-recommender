                "reviewText": "5 out of 5 Stars (5)\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50[TL;DR][QUALITY] (5/5)[VALUE] (5/5)[EASE OF USE] (5/5)[MET EXPECTATIONS] (5/5)[PACKAGING] (5/5)[REVIEW REMARKS]We have been using packing cubes for a few years now and own a number of different sets. Each set seems to offer something different than the ones before. What is different in this set to our previous sets is the inclusion of the tech bag and the drawstring bag. These have been very handy.First, these are packing cubes not compression cubes. These are for organizing your storage space and not for compressing your items. You will be able to stuff a lot of toys, clothes, lines, etc. in these cubes which does compress naturally so there is some storage space saved Just do not expect vacuum bags. Three of these bags have mesh inserts which allow for your items to breath and not smell stale.We use these cubes for organizing our storage spaces, storage of off-season clothes, for travelling, and for storing pet items. With this set, we have used the drawstring bag as a go-bag for our puppers. It has a small blanket, extra leash, toys, water bottle, a baggie of treats and a small bag of food in it for car trips. My wife is using the tech bag as an organizational tech bag in her large, hobo-style purse. The large \"secret pouch\" has an emergency winter blanket in it for the car. I guess what I am trying to say is that these bags have an endless list of uses and, with each order of them we make, we find new uses.Priced at $28.79 at the time of our order, this set of 7 storage cubes have demonstrated great value for us. The bright green colour has leant itself well to be used for emergency storage as it is easier to see it in the dark or low light over our other, darker coloured bags. I recommend this set and will keep my eye out for other sets from the manufacturer.In the event that experiences change or evolve, updates may be made to this review to address such developments.",
