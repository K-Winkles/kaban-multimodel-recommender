While I'm happy to report all of these made it through the trip in tact (which is a feat given the amount I can wrench down on those zippers); the bags were worse for wear by the time I returned home. Surprisingly the biggest issue with the cubes are the hemmed seams, which seemed to come apart on almost every bag after about 2-3 weeks.",
