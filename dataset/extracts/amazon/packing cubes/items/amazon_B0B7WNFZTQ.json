                "reviewText": "I ordered these based on the idea of their convenience and use when traveling. I planned to use them to go on a cruise and thought it would help me pack more efficiently. The first thing I noticed was one of the cubes came with the mesh part on top having about an inch long tear right at the spot it meets the nylon material - as in defectively sewn together. I didn\u2019t return it though, because I doubted it would affect the functionality. The next thing I noticed was the material and the zipper are very lightweight and feel as though it would simply tear apart if you put too much inside or if you stress the zipper at all.That being said, they did help me organize by rolling my clothing and I took far more clothes than I needed. So overall, I would say you get what you pay for. I assume the much more expensive packing cubes are probably made better, and use more resilient materials, but for the price I paid, these gave me an idea of the effectiveness of using packing cubes. They did what I needed, but if I traveled a lot, I would invest in some better ones.",
