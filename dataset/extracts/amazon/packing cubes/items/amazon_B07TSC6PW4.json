Extension zipper is cool, and helpfulMY long, somewhat rambly review:I want to start this review by saying I spent several hours looking through so many different products and their reviews that were similar to this. I get worried about buying the wrong thing so I spend a lot of time trying to find the product I think will work best and give me the most bang for my buck. Ultimately, I wasn't trying to spend a lot, but I wanted my clothes to get nice and compressed to maximize what little space I had.SO my original intent for these were to attempt to fit a weeks worth of clothes and other things (I'm an over packer, whoops, I'm working on it) into my carry on backpack so I wouldn't have to pay absurd baggage fees because I'm not made of money and airlines kinda suck. BUT THEN coronavirus struck and i canceled my flight/trip to visit my grandma. So i was like :( :( now what??AND THEN suddenly I was being kicked out of my dorm at college because it was shutting down due to coronavirus and I didn't have many storage vessels, SO i used these bad boys to pack my clothes. It was pretty nuts how much I fit into these. I pushed these little guys to the max. like i was sitting on them just to zipper them shut because they were getting stUFFED like a THanksgiving turkey lol and let me tell you, those zippers held it doWN. I wish I took pictures. I totally should have. But believe me, with just 3 of bags out of the 6 (a small, medium and large bag) I fit sweaters, long sleeves, tshirts, bras, leggings, shorts. SO many clothes. They worked great to put in both a duffel bag or suit case (shell one or regular kind) and probably a backpack, didn't get to test that one yet.It's really important to note that if you're goal is to optimize space, certain articles of clothing should be rolled while others need to just lie flat to minimize the space they take up. I found that out while packing with these. Also, even with all the stuffing, I didn't have a huge issue with wrinkles. Just have to know which clothes can be shoved and stuffed and which ones should be rolled or laid flat. Its also good to note that you can use your less stiff clothing to stuff into any air pockets you may have in the bags (ex: body suits, tank tops, thin shirts that don't wrinkle, maybe even underwear but I normally shove those in my extra pair of shoes haha).Oops, this review kind of turned into a packing guide. I put the TL;DR at the top. Hope this helps!",

They got the job done but not as well as the others. These are harder to zip and don\u2019t hold as much. They\u2019re also lumpier (I guess that\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for) once they\u2019re compressed. Overall, they\u2019re better than nothing but definitely not the best.",

Also amazing when hiking and camping to keep everything organized so you don't have to go through your whole back pack.Only thing I found inconvenient was - since they are in cubes, it does take up space in your back pack where if you just had clothes you can def pack way more in there - not a big deal.
