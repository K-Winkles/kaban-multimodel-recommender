I got these packing cubes before we left on a cruise and I was able to fit ALL of our stuff for an 8 day trip (2 adults & 1 toddler w/ diapers) in one larger roller suitcase (in the pic). I got a set of two cubes the pink and blue. I like putting all the boys stuff in the blue and my things, toiletries, and snacks in the pink. The quality is good, the zippers work well, the sizes are perfect- it\u2019s a good variety. Our stuff stayed organized and it was easy to re pack. The only thing I don\u2019t really care for are the image label tags on the outside indicating what\u2019s inside. Those have never lined up with what i put inside. I would get these for gifts for friends I like them that much.",

                "reviewText": "I have five children and was told about packing cubes for organizational purposes. A more popular name brand was recommended but for the price of those I couldn't swing five sets, especially if I wasn't sure it would really work for us. I chose this brand because of the price point and I bought two sets of two colors and another individual set (five colors for each of my five children). When these arrived I was surprised by the plentiful size of the largest cube. The varying sizes are nice. They feel a little cheap so I'm not sure of the longevity especially with young children handling them, but they were wonderful for our recent vacation. I was able to put a complete outfit (underwear and socks) plus pajamas and toothbrush for each child in the smallest cube and then I got four summer outfits (again including underwear and socks), a couple of pull-ups for those who needed them, and a pair of flip flops or sandals for each child in his/her third largest bag. And it wasn't busting at the seams. I did pack a separate bag for all our toiletries because we share much of that and wanted to use a \"generic\" bag rather than someone's color. I purposely chose to pack in a minimalist way knowing I would do laundry and we would be perfectly find re-wearing outfits (even preferring it since we took our favorite things) while on vacation for 10 days. Since I only used half of each color set, I ended up picking out one color for myself and packed the same way using the 2nd and 4th largest bags and it held all my stuff perfectly. Yes we technically had more bags, but rather than having overfilled, huge suitcases that we could barely fit in the back of our van with a stroller and beach stuff, we had easily-identifiable, easily-stackable small packs that had no problem fitting. When my husband saw the incredibly reduced amount of luggage he was shocked and was convinced I had forgotten something. These bags were so easy to throw in the car and when we stopped at family's house halfway to Florida, all the kids (except the baby) were able to easily grab their smallest bag which has a great little handle and head right inside. They knew which color was theirs and if someone couldn't remember the mesh on the front was nice because you can easily see what's inside. I will definitely be using these again and would recommend them!",

Although I was disappointed when I bought them a day or two ago because one of the cubes were missing and so I returned that and bought it again. This time, nothing was missing. I like how there is eight of them but for them could be one color and the other four could be a different color. Which if you or someone are sharing a luggage, it will be easier to identify which is which. As you can see, I chose the one with pink. The lime green ones are for my mom for her to pack her clothes in. We are going on vacation and she checked in only one big luggage. Now everything is well organized and we will probably have more room to put other stuff that isn't closed in there. Surprisingly, you can fit a lot in them! Maybe it is a little pricey but it is worth it because it will always make packing a lot easier and will last for a very long time! One more thing I may add I like how each Cube has a logo of what you can fit inside of it. Mom is so happy about it and was surprised that these packing cubes exist.",

I love that they come in two colors, so a couple can give each person a color and clothes don\u2019t get mixed together. Perfect for the couple using only 1 suitcase for a trip.I also love that when I fly, TSA isn\u2019t rummaging through my clothes and they don\u2019t look like a disaster (with the slip thrown on top). Everything stays folded and nice. Best way to organize your suitcase\u2026 and I swear it somehow makes more room.",

The only thing missing are shoe & dirty laundry bags.My only beef -- and it is more from an amusement point of view -- the bags have plastic \"clothing label\" tags -- based on the size of the bag. The smallest bags are for underthings -- and have a tag with a bra and panty (thong). Not exactly \"unisex\" as in the description. Being a male, it is kind of funny to see.I'll also say that the color difference between black and gray is not strong. Black and blue might be a better choice to make the difference obvious.Overall, seems to be a decent purchase. We'll see how they hold up after six months of flights.",

It made unpacking easier too. Now I'm going to use them to help sort my closet. I would have liked to see stronger zippers but these did the job well. I hope they last for a long time because they are great. I used the handle on each bag much more than I thought I would - they were very useful. Colour was great too!",
