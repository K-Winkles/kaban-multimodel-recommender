                "reviewText": "NEW THOUGHTS!.....I originally loved and then quickly hated these cubes after having instant issues with the zippers on my first use but this company is definitely worth purchasing from! They reached out to me immediately and acknowledged that the zippers were not their strong suit and let me know that they actually already put in the legwork to address the problem and I must say they did a FANTASTIC job. I got a new set of cubes and the zippers really have been upgraded to be more durable making these cubes now a travel necessity! Customer service is excellent as well. I highly highly recommend! I love seeing businesses actually responsive to issues and their professionalism is wonderful!ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW....I saw a few reviews scattered around about poor quality zippers but the overwhelming majority said how amazing they were so I purchased. I made it Mexico with 3 amazing cubes but unfortunately the packing back was plagued by snagging and eventually breaking zippers. I was embarrassed after gloating about my affordable find to a friend who paid up for flight 001 bags but after seeing her zippers hold up and mine not I'm annoyed that the age old phrase \"you get what you pay for\" was true in my situation, sigh....",
