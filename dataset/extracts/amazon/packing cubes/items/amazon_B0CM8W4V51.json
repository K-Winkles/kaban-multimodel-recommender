                "reviewText": "This is a really nice set of packing cubes. I was surprised by the number of cubes and variety of sizes you get with it. The designs are well thought out, I especially like that there is an external handle on each cube so that when they are in your suitcase, it's easy to grab hold of one and pull it out. Not all packing cubes I've tried have an external handle like that. The main downsides I found were that (1) the material does not feel like the strongest/highest quality material I've felt on other packing cubes and (2) some of the zippers are less-than-smooth to open and close. Mind you, neither of those negatives are things that would prevent me from using these; I'm just making note of it versus others I have tried. I have found it is never a good idea to severely overstuff a packing cube in hopes that it will magically flatten a mammoth stack of clothing. That's going to be especially true for this set; I do not think the zipper stitching would hold up to very much stress. However, if you pack clothing in these in a sensible way, they do nicely compress a reasonable amount of clothing. By virtue of the quantity of cubes you get and the variety of sizes, I think this is a great option to try out packing cubes. Overall, I'm pleased with this product.",

                "reviewText": "I got these for an international trip. I'd used packing cubes before, but never compression packing cubes. Switching to these is like going from a bicycle to a motorcycle! They are really well-made. All internal seams are fabric covered to prevent fraying and zipper snags. The zippers are all sturdy and zip smoothly. Best of all, they do exactly what they say and compress your clothing down by about 1/3rd (depending on fabric type). To demonstrate, I packed 3pairs of long-sleeved pajamas into one of the packing cubes, then did the compression zipper (see pictures). You will gain a ton of suitcase space with these! I'm not sure how wrinkled your belongings will be, so for my next trip I'm planning on not compressing my shirts and dresses cubes on the way out ( just the cubes with PJs, jeans, socks etc). Then, on the way back when I always manage to accumulate things and am in need of extra suitcase space, I'll compress all the cubes and gain an ton of space. With these compression packing cubes your suitcase will be akin to Dr. Who's spaceship--it will be bigger on the inside! Absolutely love these!",

When I ordered these, I didn't realize what a terrific variety of bags came in the set. It's a very clever system, using the same double-zipper idea used on some luggage. I'm not sure that they compress as much as the clear bags, but they are MUCH easier to use, since you open both zippers, fill the bag, then close the main zipper and then close the expansion area zipper, compacting your clothes in the process. I love the way these fit into my carry-on bag, stacked one on top of the other. I'll take an empty one with me as well, and move dirty clothes into that one.",
