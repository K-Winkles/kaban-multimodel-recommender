They are made of high-quality materials and they are very durable. I have packed them tightly and they have never ripped or torn.The OlarHike Packing Cubes come in a variety of sizes, which is great for packing different types of clothes. I have one large cube for my jeans, one medium cube for my shirts, and one small cube for my underwear and socks. I also have a slim cube for my toiletries. However I used the largest one to fir 30 clothing items in.The packing cubes are very easy to use. They have a mesh top, which makes it easy to see what is inside. They also have a zipper, which keeps your clothes organized and secure.I love how the OlarHike Packing Cubes help me to stay organized when I travel. I used to just throw my clothes in my suitcase, but now I can easily find what I need. The packing cubes also help me to save space in my suitcase.I highly recommend the OlarHike 6 Set Packing Cubes to anyone who travels. They are a great way to stay organized and save space.Here are some additional details about how I was able to fit 30 outfits in one large cube:I packed my clothes tightly. I didn't leave any empty space in the cube.I used the mesh top of the cube to my advantage. I was able to see what was inside the cube without having to open it. This made it easy to find what I needed.I was really impressed with how much I was able to pack in one cube. The OlarHike Packing Cubes are a great way to stay organized and save space when you travel.",

I usually have a full duffel bag where I have to shove the clothes in there. But with these I actually even have room/space leftover in the bag for even more stuff. They make traveling very easily. The zippers are well made, and the material is thin so the clothes can breathe however very durable and sturdy. Would definitely recommend these over the other ones that claim to \u201ccompress\u201d clothes. I feel like these are better at doing both.",

                "reviewText": "These packing cubes are great! I recently used them to pack for a 10 day mission trip. I was thrilled with how organized they kept my suitcase and stayed organized while on my trip. The material and zippers all are good quality and held up well. Zippers moved easily and the cubes never tore. All seems are still intact. My clothes stayed pretty neat and wrinkle free throughout the trip. Everything compressed down really well and left plenty of room for additional things on my return flight home. I used about half of them for clothes and the other half for my meds/first aid kit, toiletries, and bible/mission specific stuff. I'm so glad I got them and highly recommended them.",

Had all my tops in one, all my pants in another, all my underwear in a small one, socks in another, and it is amazing how everything fit in. I fit so much more than I ever thought I would into each one of these separate little carriers. Great purchase and loved the color. Absolutely recommend it, you will not regret it! And they each have a handle to carry them. They all fit perfectly in a standard large suitcase. I will not travel again without them.",

I spent a while sorting through the various offerings that had a bunch of additional pieces that I didn't necessarily need for my luggage. I wanted mostly a good assortment of the large, medium, and small cubes themselves. This is a fantastic set without all the additional pieces that I didn't need. They seem to hold up well, are very flexible, so you can fit a lot inside of them when the cube itself stretches a tad, but still keeps everything nice and secure and easy to sort through. It also has a partial mesh top so you can see what is inside of the cubes themselves. Zippers are very smooth, fabric and material is well crafted and is holding up so far. All in all, great variety, exactly what I was looking for, and highly recommended!",

They arrived quickly and as described, and they worked well on our trip. The quality seems adequate for our purposes and budget.
