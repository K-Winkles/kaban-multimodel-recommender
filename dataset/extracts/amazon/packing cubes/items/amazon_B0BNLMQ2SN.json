Fast shipping, high quality, comparable to the many other brands on here.Loved the price point for what you get. There are adjustable straps inside to secure your belongings and easy zip closures. These wipe clean and hold a lot! My trip is coming up so I will update just how much they hold next month.I bought these based on the video review I saw and the pattern. I would highly recommend this to anyone contemplating purchasing. Small cost for peace of mind!Update: These worked out amazingly, HOWEVER.., I did notice that the zippers tend to bust open (after being zipped closed) on a couple of these cubes & the shoe bag. After opening the zipper back up and then the-zipping it closed that fortunately did the trick for me. Also, one of my cubes did come apart at the seem so for that reason I\u2019d have to deduct a star. But overall, these worked out better than I had hoped and again, for this price point I would absolutely buy another set.",

Don't overfill them however if you are using a duffel bag, because the zipper will sometimes split, but it is an easy fix. 5/5 stars I would definitely recommend these for anyone looking to save space.",
