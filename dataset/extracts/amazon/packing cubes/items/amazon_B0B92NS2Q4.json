                "reviewText": "These compression packing cubes are sooo much better than many of the other ones I tested out.Why? Because of the superior materials that they are made with.The fine, very tough, smooth, and resilient mesh is the most important component: it is so translucent that is it practically clear, allowing you to easily see what clothes of yours are in each cube you pack. But since it is strong yet fine mesh, the clothes compact well and can still breathe to not get stale during travel.The rest of the materials used in the cube are also superior quality - ultra lightweight, whisper smooth and stitch seamed really well. So you can stuff them thoroughly, compress them easily, they add hardly any weight of their own, and the smooth material lets the packed cubes slither amongst each other in your suitcase or bag so the packed set settles down into its own most minimal pile.The zippers are great - strong, clean teeth and tough without being bulky.And the handles on the overall set are great.After trying several different kinds of cubes, many of which looked to be super similar to these Trippd ones - everyone in my family only wanted a set of these for themselves. No one wants to use the other ones that aren't as good for use. Either the family rejected other brands' cubes are too stiff, don't compress as well, you can't see what you packed inside the cube easily, they add unnecessary weight...or all of the above.",

                "reviewText": "This set of packing cubes offers the same great quality you get in all of the Tripped Travel Gear products. The fabric is durable and the zippers are strong. The cubes are large enough to hold bulky or larger sized clothing and fit perfectly in a standard size suitcase. This set would be perfect for a ski trip or other cold weather vacation. I love the see-through mesh front so you can see exactly what is in each cube. I machine washed them in cold water, gentle cycle and hung them to dry and they came out looking great and smelling clean. The dusty teal color matches perfectly with my dusty teal toiletry kit so I am now organized and coordinated! I would love to see this same style of packing cubes in a smaller carry-on bag size. Thanks Tripped Travel Gear for another great product!",

                "reviewText": "One of the best travel accessories I have purchased in a long time. Most packing cubes that I have used in the past are not of a compression style, these are easy to load and then simple to zip down for compression. The zippers are smooth with no tendency to catch on the material. I found the sizes to be just right with the larger ones fitting nicely in a carry on spinner bag. The material seems to be tear resistant but yet is light and translucent enough to see what is inside.I did initially question the handles, to me that seemed to be a useless feature that would take up space. But they are convenient when you want to grab several tubes at one time.The laundry bag is a great idea as well.Great kit with good features and a perfect selection of sizes.",

                "reviewText": "Terrific packing cubes that compress the contents to allow more room in luggage. I especially like that you can see through them at a glance to see what\u2019s in them. I had previously bought a different brand that was described as being see-through, but really wasn\u2019t - these actually are. Also really like the different sizes being offered in this set, and the bag for dirty laundry. Cubes are attractive, and look like they\u2019re well-made. Hoping they\u2019ll last many years. By the way, this type of compression cube does not completely remove all air, like the familiar clear plastic zip packing/storage bags. The good thing about that is they don\u2019t smash and wrinkle your clothing like those vacuum bags - I didn\u2019t need to press anything.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't traveled with it yet - but I really this. It's pricey, but it's good quality. Nice to look at, nice material. I previously tried another less expensive brand, and that look and felt cheap - sort of loud and crunchy. Can definitely shove quite a bit into these when the cube is expanded and then you compress down by zippering up the second zipper. It doesn't compress like a vacuum sealed bag or anything, but you do definitely save some space. And it keeps stuff organized. I'm packing for a trip right now and can put all my tshirts in one, pants in another, etc. And it's sheer so you know what's what.",

This makes it easier to know which zipper is the first zipper and which zipper is the second or compression zipper. Also, nice see-through top fabric. Seems like higher quality, nicer fabric than other cubes I\u2019ve tried.",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy I purchased this set of travel bags! They made my trip to Minnesota a breeze! I was staying at a few different locations and I was able to easily sort my bulky clothes neatly in my suitcase.A few features that were extra handy:- I like that you can see into the bag when it is completely zipped. It made it easier for me to remember which bag was for which location. I could also survey all my options without forgetting what I packed!- The compression zipper being a different color is a game changer! I always knew I was pulling on the correct zipper!- The laundry bag was amazing! Kept sweaty garments away from the rest of my suitcase, and since the clothes were all together, it made my trip to the washing machine a breeze!- These bags were great straight out of the packaging. I'm incredibly sensitive to smells and this product didn't have any chemical smells when I got it out of the shipping box. I also didn't experience any smells on my clothes after using the bags!I have only used them for two trips, so I can't comment on longevity, but I think these bags are a win if you are looking for a quality travel bag with a compression option!",

                "reviewText": "After years of travelling, I discovered these compression packs recently & they were the best thing I took on a 2 month holiday to Europe. I ironed everything before putting into packs and they kept my clothes organised with minimal creasing. Although the sizes initially looked small, they fitted perfectly into my suitcase and anything bigger would have made my bags too heavy. They're also great in carry-on bags to keep your clothes neat & tidy. I have recommended them to all my friends plus they're a great present.",
