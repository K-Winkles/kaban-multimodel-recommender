They've been on every continent with me. Those aren't waterproof, but fulfill an important role in my packing strategy.Now I've added these water and dust proof cubes to my equipment. They're made of durable ripstop nylon and have sealed zippers to keep out the dust and water. I've got plenty of dry bags, but in many situations those are overkill and these suited nomad bags fill the need better. For land trips, I'm going to be using these instead of drybags. They're more conevient than drybags, and hold more contents in a more space-efficient way. Which is perfect for packing outings in rain and stream crossings. They might be a good choice for the beach, too. I'll find out when the weather warms up.Anywhere I don't need to use the ultralight compression bags, I'm going to be replacing my old packing cubes with these. They're more durable and have the advantage of being waterproof.The handles on the edges of the bags are stout and sewed on really well. So that gives options for externally mounting, or just conveniently carrying in your hand.",

                "reviewText": "From someone who travels the world and spends a lot of time outdoors, these adventure packing cubes are extremely high quality! The material is thick and obviously waterproof. The way the zippers are designed creates a waterproof closure. Each cube has two handles on each side which makes it handy to grab or carry as a standalone. The handles seem to be sewed on very well. These cubes help with organizing and are also great for the beach, lake, hiking and camping. I've been using Suite Nomad's Compression packing cubes when traveling and have been amazed at the quality of their products. I am so glad to add this to my travel equipment, especially for day hikes.",

                "reviewText": "The products are nice for packing items that may leak, or just to provide additional protection to items from light moisture. These are not totally waterproof, if you put something wet like a bathing suit in the bag, it will probably make other items in your luggage damp. Also if you use them on a small boat where sea spray or sea water on floor will get to it, the items inside will get wet. We used these on a recent trip and used the largest one for additional protection for a MS Surface Tablet (not on the boat).",
