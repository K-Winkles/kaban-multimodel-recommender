                "reviewText": "These are so worth it! My son is serving a church service mission for 2 years in a foreign country. These packing cubes kept everything so tidy and nice! The large containers fit his slacks and white dress shirts very nicely. The shoe container was super nice. I just love it. It's lightweight and the mesh strips are awesome. I packed a ton of supplies and nice clothing and it fit almost everything. His luggage looks awesome. I think these are practically perfect! I did have to buy an additional set of plastic toiletry bags to hold some of my son's toiletry items because we sent him with a lot of stuff. But the toiletry bag that this set comes with is very nice and will probably serve as the bag he uses for the current items he has open.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Shacke Pak vs eBags! Quality construction, Great design, EXCELLENT ZIPPER...made me a BELIEVER in PACKING CUBES!!",
                "reviewText": "Pros:- Quality build- Excellent zipper quality and durability- Strong seams- Lightweight- Open netting design allows for visibility of contents and easy compression- Attractive but simple colors and design- Comfortable zipper pulls- Comes with sack to carry all the packing cubes and can alternatively be used as a travel laundry bag- 4 packing cubes for the price of many competitors offering 3- Excellent customer serviceCons:- Nothing major at the moment, but I am starting to notice after a few months of use that some of the seams appear to be stretching a little too far and am concerned that it may tear after a while- The plastic spring cord lock used on the sack that carries all the packing cubes (I used the sack as a \"dirty laundry bag\") broke after a monthPersonal Experience:Ask me a year ago whether I would ever have packing cubes and I would have scoffed at you and declared that it was illogical to try to save packing space by using packing cubes that forced the cube shape. Now...I'm a believer!!Packing cubes have changed the way I packed forever. Not only does it organize everything I pack (underwear, socks, pajamas go in one; shirts and pants go in another, etc), it allows me to pack 2-3 times more than I used to be able to because you are able to squeeze everything into a packing cube and then zip it up. Packing cubes don't add any appreciable weight to your luggage because they are so lightweight anyway. And for longer trips, I simply take out my packing cubes from my duffel bag/suitcase and they serve as drawers for all my travel items.In terms of Shacke Pak specifically, I referenced in my \"Pros\" why I think Shacke Pak is generally superior to other brands. In particular, I received one packing cube that had an issue with the zipper that resulted in the zipper handle breaking pre-maturely. I contacted Shacke Pak and customer service immediately sent me a replacement packing cube without any hassle. I am very pleased with the customer service and it has given me some measure of confidence that they will continue to take care of their customers in the future.**Update: I also own two sets of eBags packing cubes (you can read my other reviews) and have had the opportunity to compare them directly to Shacke Pak. In all honesty, both brands make exceptional packing cubes and you really wouldn't be disappointed either way. But to be nit picky, I will share a few of my observations:- Shacke Pak uses a material with a matte finish compared to the more shiny honeycomb design of eBags. The Shacke Pak material stretches ever so slightly, whereas the eBags material has very little give. As a result, it appears that the material eBags uses is slightly more durable, but Shacke Pak looks slightly more premium.- Shacke Pak uses hidden stitching beneath the zippers, whereas eBags uses a double stitched design in most places. After owning the Shacke Pak packing cubes for about a year, I am noticing that the hidden stitching under the zipper pulls a little more and actually becomes visible when I pack the cubes tightly. This concerns me slightly and makes me question the long term durability whereas eBags' double stitched design seems to hold strong regardless of how tightly I pack the cubes.- The depth of Shacke Pak packing cubes is .75\" to 1\" more, so you can pack more.- The zipper pull handle (not the zipper itself) on one of my packing cubes from Shacke Pak fell off after one month. I contacted Shacke Pak and they immediately sent me an entire new packing cube. Shacke Pak demonstrated excellent customer service, but at the same time I am a little concerned that something like that happened so quickly in the first place. Since then, I have had no issues with my two sets of packing cubes from Shacke Pak. I have had no issues with eBags in terms of the zippers or zipper handles in the 6 months that I have owned them.- Shacke Pak packing cubes gives you 4 for the price of approximately 3 from eBags. Also, Shacke Pak includes a pouch with the packing cubes that can be conveniently used as a dirty laundry bag when you're travelling. You seem to get a little more for your money with Shacke Pak.- Zipper quality for both is excellent, as they both use YKK zippers.- Overall: You can't go wrong with either and each brand has slight advantages over the other in a few areas. I personally think eBags is slightly more durable, but that Shacke Pak is slightly more attractive and gives you a little more for your money.Conclusion:If you are looking for a high quality and durable set of packing cubes for travelling, you really can't go wrong with the Shacke Pak set. The price is reasonable and you get 4 packing cubes for the price of what most competitors charge for 3. I have not had any real issues with quality or durability (I travel and use these a lot, but I will update my review in the future), and Shacke Pak has already demonstrated to me that they have excellent customer service. I also think the Shacke Pak packing cube set provides one of the most stylish designs compared to the others out there.**I have included a picture of one my packing cubes when it is packed tightly showing what I mean about the hidden stitching being stretched and visible. This concerns me a bit.",

                "reviewText": "I had a friend recommend packing cubes when she heard my husband, two year old, and I were going to Europe for two weeks and staying at 6 different hotels. I looked at a variety of options when typing in \"packing cube\" and finally decided on the Shacke Pak brand and Bago brand.I chose the Shacke Pak brand because I liked that it offered four different sizes and it being my first time purchasing these I wasn't exactly sure what sizes to get. I also liked that with Shacke Pak it came with a laundry bag, which definitely came in handy, because there were times we got rained on all day and with our full packed trip and we didn't have time to find a washer and dryer, so it was nice to separate some of our dirty clothes in the laundry bag. I also really liked the biggest size that it came with and was able to pack almost all of my clothes in just the biggest size for a two week trip!The reason I chose the Bago brand was because I liked that you had the option to choose all of one color or two different colors. I also liked that it came with 6 organizer bags which I used to put our liquids in, incase they leaked. The organizer bags are a lot thicker than your regular ziplock bag, which is what I have usually used, so these will last a lot longer, and there are multiple sizes, so I could separate our toothbrushes and paste in one and soaps and lotions, etc. in another. I also used them to put chargers and adapters in, so they were all together.Overall, between the two brands, as far as durability goes, I honestly didn't notice much of a difference. They are both really thin and light, so they don't take up any extra room in your suitcase! We had them packed full, (especially on our way home) and we didn't have any problems with them! They served their purpose and if or when I need more I will definitely purchase again! Shake Pak was a little more expensive than Bago. I believe I paid $21.99 for Bago and $29.99 for Shacke Pak. I really like the biggest size that came with Shacke Pak, the Bago ones I purchased only offered two sizes that were the two middle sizes offered from this Shacke Pak purchase.Also, I should mention, I purchased brands different from what my friend recommended because these were half the price and honestly, I loved both of them and thought they were very durable. I can't say enough good things about packing bags and I don't know how I ever lived without them! We took one big suitcase, because with a toddler, we needed one person to have free hands when traveling between hotels. In our big suitcase, we packed all four of the Bago bags, and then the 3 biggest Shacke Pak bags. So, that's 7 packing bags, stuffed clear full in one big suitcase for a two week trip across Europe. We each used two bags, and then used one bag for liquids and accessories like chargers. And on our way home, we had the laundry bag half way full, with the 7 bags clear full and we were still able to zip our suitcase up! Also, each bag comes with a handle, and we packed them so the handles were on top, so we could grab our bag out of the suitcase by the handle!On our way across Europe we picked up many souvenirs that we rolled up with our clothes, so we were able to fit even more stuff in our suitcase! These were so convenient too, because each of us had a different color, so when we needed something, rather than making a mess of the whole suitcase trying to find it, we would grab the color of bag for that person! Prior to this, I would end up repacking the suitcase every time we moved locations, so, if you are debating whether or not to get Packing Bags, I would recommend you make the purchase! These are a time saver and space saver! It is so convenient to just grab your bag and put it in the dresser at the hotel, rather than all of your clothes, and they beat repacking your suitcase every time you move locations, or even just when you're leaving to go home.Overall, the Shacke Pak brand was great, we liked the variety of sizes (especially the biggest size) and that it came with a laundry bag. Lastly, if you haven't purchased or used Packing Bags before, I would highly recommend them! They are amazing!",

                "reviewText": "Works great for organizing your luggage and saving space in your suitcase. Very lightweight and easy to clean. Machine washable. Thin but strong nylon bags with mesh and zippers. Mesh allows you to see what\u2019s in each bag. The laundry bag is useful for travel too for dirty clothes. Should retail for half the price they\u2019re selling it for in my opinion. Not a necessity for traveling but definitely makes living out of a suitcase much easier. I fold clothes in half and then roll them up and place in the bags. It\u2019s nice to be able to easily get to clothes without having to dig through suitcase and make a mess. It\u2019s so easy to take clothes in and out of the suitcase quickly and easily without hassle. You can take all your clothes out of your suitcase and then put them all back in quickly and neatly. You can also use them inside drawers while traveling or at home. Hopefully they last a long time, I think they will. One star off for the price. A little expensive for what they are. They\u2019ve gone up in price since I bought them in August 2023.",
