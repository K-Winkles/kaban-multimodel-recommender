                "reviewText": "[Updated review, Sept 2023] I'm still very happy with these packing cubes. They've been on about ten trips and they still look and feel new. I threw them in the washing machine once when they'd absorbed the smell of dirty laundry, and they made it through the wash intact and clean. I used a mesh laundry bag to contain them during the wash since I didn't want the zipper pulls to get caught and damage the cubes or my machine. Would still recommend these cubes to any traveler looking for a starter set.[Original review, Nov 2022] I've started traveling more recently, and I finally decided to follow the common travel advice to use packing cubes. I thought, surely it doesn't make THAT big a difference, does it?It does. Even without compression, packing cubes allow you to be more organized and efficient, which makes for a better travel experience. Need to open your luggage at the airport? You can easily find what you need without dumping everything on the ground. Unpacking at the hotel? A breeze - just grab the cube handles and plunk the cubes directly into drawers. I didn't know what I'd been missing.They're perfectly sized to fit in standard carry-on luggage (one of each size per carry on, so a six-cube set is enough for two people). The cube handles are nice when unpacking - you can grab everything all at once - and the mesh panels allow things to breathe a bit during travel. I roll my clothes and can fit one layer of rolled items in each cube. My clothes did wrinkle, but that's to be expected when traveling, not a big deal. At the end of your trip you can roll up all your dirty clothes and repack them into these cubes... which you can then unzip and empty directly into the washing machine upon arriving home.So far these seem sturdy and I don't have any concerns about durability - not even the mesh panels. I bought these less expensive cubes thinking I'd give them a shot and then upgrade to something better if I liked the concept... but they're quite good and I can't think of what would need to be upgraded, so I'm just going to keep using these!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased these well over a year ago. Hated that I always had to dig through the whole suitcase to find my stuff in the morning, often in the dark. These packing cubes are awesome for organizing, and holding up well. Zippers are solid, well-stitched. Sizes are convenient. Am added benefit is organization while I'm packing,as I'll often go straight from the laundry into the bag. I can keep better control over the number of each item, and pack one at a time. I don't usually use hotel dressers, but when I am in a single location for a couple days, I can just set them in the drawers, and my stuff is easy to find, and quick to replace in the suitcase. I liked them so much I bought my daughter a set too. We both recommend them highly.",

These are much more substantial in the weight of the material ( not heavy tho)My only complaint is in sizing.I wish these sets came with 4- mid size cubes.and only 1- larger cube.Unless your taking a month long holiday, I can\u2019t see getting much use for 2 of the larger cubes. If you travel with a carry on primary, the mid and small will be your go to.This is a fantastic set and I hope the manufacturer offers the ability to buy more of the mid and smaller size options.Those work best for most travelers.Very happy with my purchase:)",

We live overseas and flying out of this (our passport) country, we\u2019re always heavy, but other than that, these are ideal for travel. The thickness of the fabric means it lasts really long and doesn\u2019t fray around the seams or zipper. I have a different color for each family member so we can easily grab our stuff out of the main bag once we land. Highly recommended.",
