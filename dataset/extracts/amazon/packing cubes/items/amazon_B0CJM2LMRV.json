                "reviewText": "I travel pretty frequently for usually 2 nights away from home at a time and usually grab the laundry service bag the hotel provides to pack my used clothes in. This organization bag is going to help with keeping my laundry away from my clean clothes. The divider appears to be air-tight which will prevent odors from one side from seeping through to the other. the mesh outer shell is great as it allows for easy identification of the articles and air flow. there is a middle zipper that lets the bag expand to accommodate more items. Whats nice is that each side has two pockets for smaller articles of clothing.",

                "reviewText": "So it's pretty small when it's delivered, but after expanding, I was able to fit about 8 sweatshirts and hoodies into this thing. It essentially looked like a box by the time I was done packing it.Each side had this divider type thing. I don't necessarily see a use for them yet, however I'm certain I will come across an instance where I will utilize them.Very impressed with the storage space. It truly does do what it claims to do.",

                "reviewText": "I tested this with dirty laundry. I threw it in there, and didn't fold it up. While I was able to fit a good amount of laundry in there, the compression was underwhelming. I was expecting a vacuum bag sort of effect. While it did compress, it didn't get it down to that flat, smaller size I was expecting. This still works and I'll travel with it. Just be aware if you're going for something like a vacuum plastic bag where you suck out the air. This is not going to give you that.",
