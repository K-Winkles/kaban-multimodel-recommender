                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars BEST BUY EVER FOR TRAVELLING!",
                "reviewText": "One word: WOW!I rarely write product reviews these days, but oh, as a travel lover I need to tell all fellow travelers about compression cubes. They will change your world!! Read below my five reasons on why these Eagle Creek compression cubes are life changing!Let's admit it, we all buy a lot of items for our trips that we really did not need to spend money on, but these will probably be one of your best buys for travelling ever! I had read that a lot of travelers and backpackers swear by travel compression cubes. I now know why!! I am an avid traveler, travelling with either carry-ons or backpacks, depending on the trip, and believe me: once you try them, I doubt that you'll go back to travelling without cubes!These ones by Eagle Creek are flawless, in my opinion. I've never been so happy to find a product that solves so many problems and frustrations that us travelers have had at some point during our trips, with just one simple product!Hands down, these Eagle Creek compression cubes are MY BEST BUY AS FAR AS TRAVEL GOES.HERE ARE THE 5 REASONS:1 - THE SPACE SAVING IS INCREDIBLE!(See photos of before/after. Both photos are of the small cube)I couldn't believe it. Throughout the years, I have used several strategies to save space inside my bags, like rolling the clothes instead of folding them, or binding them with elastic bands to keep them together and compress them a little bit, but nothing works like these cubes in terms of space saving. I believe I am not exaggerating if I say that these cubes reduced the space by 50% or even 2/3!For you to have an idea of how much it might fit, I was able to fit my whole clothes for two-week trip to a tropical destination in these two cubes (one small and another one medium).In the small cube: I was able to fit, 5 tops and 1 dress (I believe it would fit one or two more tops)In the medium cube: I fit 2 sweaters, 1 blouse, 1 pair of shorts (I believe it would have fit 1 or 2 more long-sleeved shirts or blouses or 1 pair of jeans even)If it's your first time using compression cubes (or depending on different types of clothes you might need for your trip) it might take you a couple of tries to see what's the best folding type, how many items you can fit inside each bag, and in which position you should place them, but I think it just takes a couple of minutes to figure it out - I found it quick, easy and intuitive. Just be careful, patient and USE the old good COMMON SENSE :). The Eagle Creek compression cubes are really good quality, incluing the plastic which is thick and the zippers. But again, use common sense - the bags do fit a lot, but if you see that the bag is not closing even if you're squishing it hard, don't force the bag and zippers. Maybe you have placed too many items inside? Maybe they need to be folded differently? Maybe you need to remove one item or try to include another piece of clothing that's smaller? Again, common sense. That goes for the plastic as well. While you're closing the bag, you got to make sure the plastic is not getting stuck in the zippers, but again that carefulness goes for any bag!2 - YOUR CLOTHES WILL NOT BE DANCING AROUND THE BAG AND THEY WILL BE SUPER EASY TO ACCESS!The clothes will not be moving around inside the bag, and once you get to your destination it is super easy to access them. Because the Eagle Creek bags are translucent (despite that, again, the plastic is thick and feels super good quality), you can easily see what you've packed inside the bags (I've order the white ones and you can clearly see the colors and patterns of the clothes you put inside). No more roaming around the bag searching for clothes! I'm so happy!!3 - YOUR CLOTHES DON'T GET ALL WRINKLED LIKE WITH THOSE TRADITIONAL VACCUM BAGSIf you've used the vacuum compression bags, you know the items might be wrinkly after you \"de-vaccum\" the bags. I found that these compression cubes by Eagle Creek do compress a lot and save so much space, but not to the point of getting your clothes all wrinkled to the point that you feel you cannot use them in public unless there's some serious ironing.4 - THE BAGS ARE WATER REPELLENTThis is a great added bonus in my opinion! I just never gave too much attention to the fact that the liquids I'm carrying in my clear liquids' bag might actually spill and get out of the bag itself, and have some of my clothes ruined. Something sometimes we don't think about until it happens. In case you have the bad luck of that happening to you, I am happy to think that my clothes might be a little bit more protected given that the bags are water repellent (not waterproof. A lot of people confuse waterproof with water-repellent. But still, much better to have this extra layer of protection, than the clothes just being there hanging around your bag completely unprotected).5 - THE BAGS ARE WASHABLETreated with love and care, they will last you for many trips, or even a lifetime.",

To me they actually take up more room than just laying my clothes flat. I guess they are somewhat useful if you are packing your clothes into a smaller backpack or some thing around that size but it makes no sense to use these packing cubes in any kind of carry-on luggage, duffel bag or standard check in luggage. I save way, way more room by just laying my clothes flat.If it wasn\u2019t for the sticker getting jammed for no reason I may have kept them but there are other options out there. I think this brand is a little overpriced.",
