You have several sizes of bag and can use what you need for your trip/luggage, but they are fairly well thought out in terms of usefulness. I am not necessarily a fan of the strange tag line on a couple of the bags, but that is easily overlooked. They are form over function, as they are mostly for use in your luggage. Even when I don't take the three main bags; the shoe bag, toiletry bag, and accessory bag are always helpful to take along. I can recommend these, but I don't know how long they will last. They are well-priced for what you get. There are many others of varying quality, but this is a safe bet.",

                "reviewText": "I learned to appreciate packing cubes on a long term study abroad trip where I only had a small carry on and a backpack. I didn\u2019t think packing cubes would make a huge difference, but let me tell you: they absolutely do. Years later, I still regularly use packing cubes, but I recently got a much larger suitcase, and decided I needed an additional set of cubes\u2014 one for each side of the suitcase. This set is designed much better than my past packing cube sets, and I really love it. It\u2019s an 8-piece, very comprehensive set of packing cubes. The two larger cubes have compression straps which help to condense whatever is packed within. There is an \u201cundergarment\u201d bag which does not have a mesh top, which seems like a really thoughtful design. The accessories bag is great for chargers and other odds and ends that are typically loose within my suitcase, and the toiletries bag is good for hair products and brushes, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. the cubes are made of a durable, water-resistant material; they\u2019re constructed well and feel like they\u2019ll hold up well over time. Each cube has a handle and a zipper that feels durable. The packing cubes are great to condense the amount of clothes, and for me they help to reduce the amount of things I pack (I\u2019m a chronic over-packer). Having my suitcase neat and tidy helps to streamline my mornings while traveling and also helps to keep everything in one place rather than spread out around the room. In my pictures, you can see how the cubes really reduce the overall clutter of my clothes into a neat pile. Imagine how nice this is in a suitcase!Note: if your toiletries bag arrives misshapen/bent, heat it gently with a hairdryer and reshape!",

The zippers glide with ease. All the bags are very light weight, which is a plus if your always traveling as I do. Appreciate all the different sizes of the bags and how versatile they are. For the price we gave it a 5 out of 5",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice idea and it has several different sized bags. Each bag fits more than you may think and once finished it does neatly go into the suit case. It came with a laundry bag, as well, but it is really small and only held a few dirty items. I didn't like the toiletry bag, for when you put one's toiletries in it, you could not see everything clearly through the mesh. Also it is important to note that if you have a lot to pack and need to use every available space, these bags do not allow that. Otherwise, I did like them for use for shorter trips when I don't need to pack so much. I also like how they all store into the largest of the bags.",

                "reviewText": "I love packing cubes. I use them for every vacation I take, they are essential to keep you organized and sane. I was a bit disappointed in the durability of these cubes. When I'm in a hurry packing or unpacking (which seems to happen a lot when I've procrastinated and am running late to hit the road) I do not take the time to open and close this gently, which this set obviously needs. I'm not sure how long it's going to last for me because it's not as durable as I'd like it to be.I like that it has straps that I can buckle things down with so that they don't side everywhere, but since I pack my cubes totally full, it's not a feature that I really need. Even though you get a bunch of bags in this set, I'm not convinced the price is justified.I do like that there are a variety of bags included, I like to separate out different bags for different items, but again, they're all made in the same delicate manner, so I question the long term durability of these items. I think they'll last a few trips, but I'm not sure what will happen after the 3rd or 4th trip, especially if you're like me and just throw the bag in the drawer at your destination and get your items out that way instead of unpacking it fully.",

I unfortunately was flagged at the airport for a more thorough search and having my stuff packed in these cubes made the experience so much easier and quicker than if I had packed my suitcase without them. Some of the cubes have a mesh side, so you can easily see what you have inside. I also feel like I was able to pack more into my carry on, then if I didn't pack with these. I wish the zippers for more heavy duty. Although they didn't malfunction during my trip, I feel that with extensive use, this may become a problem in the future. Very useful and definitely a good buy.",
