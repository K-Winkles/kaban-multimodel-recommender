The quality of the cubes are thin and light weight but durable enough to stuff it with clothes without ripping. Perfect in keeping your clothes organized. We have now used these in a couple of more trips and its worth having. It minimizes the bulk that unorganized packing does. I highly recommend this product!",

I was disappointed in the compression components being just two flimsy straps built into the larger cubes. Real compression cubes have double zippers to compress the clothes down. The fabric is thin and feels cheap. I would not buy this again.",
