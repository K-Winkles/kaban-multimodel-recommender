I roll up tops in one, socks in one, underclothes in one and toiletries in a 4th. Then all the folded items go in the bottom of the case. Four of these fit perfectly in a carry-on, allow easy access to contents and folded items. There are half size ones available, which may work better for toiletries and sundries (camera, cables, occasional medications). Eagle creek cubes are well made and the mesh on one side makes it easy to see what each one holds. I started using them, now everyone else in my family does; so easy to keep everything organized.",

A bit hard to find the reds nowadays tho that every so often she ends up taking from my sets.We have these old models and prefer them to the newer ones. Unfortunately they aren\u2019t as widely available nowadays. Have multiple pcs of each size. Simply the most useful durable cubes ever. Bought my first batch more than 10 years ago and still using them until today. Have bought a piece of the different newer models but still like these ones more",

I use two in my Osprey Kestral 38 along with a shoe bag, toiletry case, a half cube dry/wet Eagle Creek bag. The frames around the bag help keep everything structured, and can be squished to fit everything in my pack. The zippers aren't YKK, but I cant notice any differences. These keep me super organized and so I know exactly where all my things are. Hopefully I'll never misplace my underwear or socks again, ha.",

                "reviewText": "These simple, highly durable nylon pouches may seem like an excess purchase for those who are always on the move (and to be honest, they may be). However, they excel at their purpose - they help you organize your suitcase/duffel/carry-on without fail. Packing (and unpacking!) is so much easier with these. After using these with my duffel bag, I could simply never revert to the unorganized mess I used to travel with.",
