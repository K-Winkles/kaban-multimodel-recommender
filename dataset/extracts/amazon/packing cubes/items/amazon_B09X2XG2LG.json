                "reviewText": "I didn't know I needed these until I got them!Our son was going off to camp & I came across these and thought what a great idea for creating some organization. These did just that. They also seemed to compact his things down somewhat creating more space. I liked the fact that when our son got to camp, he could just lift these out of his bag, open them up and put them in his cubby, almost creating drawers for him and additional organization. We are all very pleased with them and now can't imagine not using them.The quality also seems good and so far the zippers have held up. Would definitely recommend.",

The sizes fit a lot. 2 large ones in a small carry on. Or 4 large in my regular suitcase. I was able to fit all clothing items for 6 days in one large bag for 10 year old. I hope to fit about a week of women\u2019s clothing in one large and one medium. I took one star off because zippers do seem cheaply made but for prize point I wasn\u2019t expecting best. I bought two sets.",

However, I decided to try them again because we were going on a trip that would be 'living out of a suitcase '. They were great! I packed 2 outfits for my husband and myself in the big cubes. Used the medium cubes for my husband's socks/underwear and another one for PJS. I was able to use the small cubes for my items. I labeled all the cubes. Each day we were able to grab the cube needed and then repack super easy. I definitely can recommend these. The zippers held up too.",

I\u2019d buy these again.I let my teenager use one for a trip and she just stuffed things inside and I worried about it tearing or busting the zipper but it held good.",

                "reviewText": "I used these for three trips so far, and they helped a lot. I mostly use the two smaller sizes in the set, because it's the smaller clothing items that get lost easily in a big suitcase. The inside of my suitcase is black so I bought cubes in a light color to help them stand out.They really do hold more than I expected. Of course, you have be reasonable because it depends on your clothing size and whether you're packing winter or summer clothes. I filled the cubes to the max, but did not overfill them to the point they were difficult to zip. After one long weekend and two trips of two weeks each, the cubes are still like brand new.Even though they have a net viewing window, I still find it's helpful to label them (fine point sharpie on scotch magic tape, which peels off easily when home again). On my first use, the long weekend, I put each outfit in a separate cube, but I had packed all black clothing to keep everything coordinated so couldn't tell which cube was which until they were unzipped.For the longer trips, one smallest-size cube fit 14 pairs of medium-weight womens socks; the other held 14 pairs of underwear and some bras. One middle-size cube held winter nightclothes; the other held clothes for four dressy occasions (one skirt, two turtlenecks, two short sleeve knit tops, a slip, tights and a cardigan sweater). I did not pack the pants, sweatshirts and the rest of the tops in cubes because they stay stacked well in the suitcase.Following the advice of other reviewers, I used the leftover large-size cubes for organizing my linen closet. Each fits a queen fleece blanket. In fact, I ordered another set of cubes so I can finish organizing the closet.",
