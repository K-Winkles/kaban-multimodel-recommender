                "reviewText": "The mesh top is nice so you can see what each packing cube contains. The zippers are very sturdy and slide easily. I like the smaller sizes of these packing cubes since you can just plop them in a drawer if you are staying at a hotel or on a cruise ship. All items fold into a small bundle for easy packing for the trip home and are very lightweight.",

It also helps when you are getting dressed bc you don't have to dig through everything in the suitcase to find a specific outfit, you can just pull out one cube.",

I have bought 4 sets of these and gifted two of them. I absolutely love them and highly recommend. It is truly awesome if you have kids and you have to pack them all in the same suitcase, they get their own packing cube to help minimize fights.",

While they do worked really well to separate outfits per day, for example, I do feel that they take up more room than simply packing in a suitcase. If organization is your main objective, then this is a good product for you. I can\u2019t speak to the long-term quality, but they do appear to be well-made.",

This product does its job, keeping items organized and separate. It\u2019s durable, and seems to be well made: I opened and closed my organizing cubes MANY times and didn\u2019t have a single snag.",

                "reviewText": "While I was excited to organize my luggage with the HOTOR Packing Cubes, I found them to be just okay. The set of six pieces seemed promising, but the cubes were smaller than I expected, limiting their capacity. The water-resistant feature worked well, but the zippers felt a bit flimsy and prone to getting stuck. They did help keep things organized to some extent, but I wished they had more structure to maintain their shape inside the suitcase. Overall, they did the job but didn't exceed my expectations. Also, it was $15 which was way overpriced.",
