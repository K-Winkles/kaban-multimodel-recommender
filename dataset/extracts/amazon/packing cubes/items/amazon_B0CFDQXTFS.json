                "reviewText": "I took these with us on a trip recently. You need to fold your clothes to the proper sizes to fill the bags but it's worth it. Just leave an inch on each side so you can zip the sides up/compress. Everything gets to your destination in good shape and the perk is that when you need to open up your suitcase to grab stuff/move things around these are so super awesome. You can whip the bags around instead of having to carefully move clothes piles around and hope they don't spill out when you flip your suitcase closed. Will absolutely use these on my future trips!The zippers are all in good shape. I like that the real opening is a green zipper and the compression is the black so you don't waste time fiddling with the wrong zippers. The clear vinyl case that they came with was a bit stiff so I'm just using it to store the other bags in between travel.",

I've never been on a cruise or anywhere for an extended amount of time with limited access to any necessities should I forget or need something. I worried that I would overpack, not pack the right stuff, or forget something altogether. These cubes helped me stay organized and kept me from over packing. I used a cube for tops. one for bottoms, one for swimwear/athleticwear, one underwear/socks/pjs, and one for toiletries that wouldn't fit in my cosmetic bag...like my curling iron, and I used one for things like my umbrella, binoculars, beach towel, hats, and accessories (hats, eyeglasses, chargers). Sounds like a pain, but I found that if I started early and started just laying things out \"by cubes\", I could edit my stuff and get them to fit in the cube that I assigned my stuff to...obsessive maybe, but it helped, and I also knew where everything was and put some of the cubes right into the drawer when we got to our stateroom. The cubes are nicely made, have durable zippers, and the material is strong...I was impressed by how much I could get into those cubes. I would highly recommend these packing cubes; I will not travel without them.",
