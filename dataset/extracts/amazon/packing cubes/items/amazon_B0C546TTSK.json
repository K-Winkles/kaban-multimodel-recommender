                "reviewText": "These are great lightweight packing cubes - they are Great for compact packing. They are made from thin lightweight rip-stop fabric that is pretty water resistant and strong. The set comes with 4 cubes (2 sm, 1 med, 1 lg sizes), a shoe bag, 13\"x10\" drawstring bag, hanging toiletry bag & waterproof phone bag. The cubes hold compression great - you can stuff them almost double with clothes and press down to get the heavy-duty zipper closed and they will keep the compression and their shape letting me fit more into my carry-on hardshell suitcase than I could without them. I got and used them for a 3night cruise and was able to (over)pack everything I wanted into my small carry spinner suitcase on vs. having to pare it down or use a larger suitcase. Plus the larger one worked as a laundry bag during the cruise. When they are not full they roll up compact and are easy to store in my case's side pouch. They can also be washed in the washing machine like clothes. Nice for easy unpacking.The hanging toiletry bag is really nice & cruise perfect too. It is very well made and designed - nice materials and finishing. I am very impressed with the thoughtful design of this case. There are individual spaces for bottles and flatter items and it all folds together neatly. I have 6 3oz TSA approved silicone flexible tubes that I use to hold shampoo/conditioner/body wash/soap/face wash/lotion/sunscreen and they are kind of squishy so fit great. The hook is large and sturdy - can hang over a door if needed. We are going on a 3night cruise and this bag is perfect for saving counter space in the tiny bathroom and still keep all my stuff close & easy to access.This set ALSO comes with a waterproof phone bag that is really nice quality and works perfectly (we tested it). For the price this is by far the best set out there - you get everything you need for $25 vs. buying them separately for $10-15 each. Plus the bright aqua color is great & matches my suitcase perfectly. Really - this is a great set and I am so happy with it.",

The included waterproof phone pouch was a bonus that I didn't use but I'm happy it's there if I ever need it.",

                "reviewText": "These travel organizers are exactly as I expected. I believe they only came in black on my Vine acct, but now that I see the additional colors I would have preferred a lighter color. Since they are for air travel I did not expect heavy duty quality and there was no smell when taken out of the packaging. The 1st pic is the entire set out of the package and it weighs 1lb 1.75 oz which is what you want if flying. I tried all the zippers and each of them works well however I wouldn't try to over stuff and expect the zippers to hold up. For me the best thing is the makeup/toiletries bag as it's perfect for storing in a suitcase and the hook fits over a towel rod. For larger items or things that may leak you could also use the zippered waterproof bag. The shoe bag is large and should accommodate men's shoes or 2 pair of womens. The drawstring laundry bag is very small for laundry (but it does hold 2 bottles of wine). I think I'll keep mine in the car to hold collapsible bowls, paper towels, extra leash, etc for my dog since it fits under the seat. I have no need for an underwater phone case but my Samsung does fit perfectly in the clear window and you can swipe thru the plastic, I would expect taking pics may not be as sharp. I suggest you stuff it with tissues and submerge to test it prior to using it scuba diving. I do regularly travel by car for short trips and will certainly get some use with some of these organizers, but probably won't use them all at the same time.",

However, I was disappointed with these packing cubes. These packing cubes are pretty, but not very useful for packing. One of the zipper pulls fell off before I could even use the cubes. Another one of the cubes completely fell apart (stitching came undone) before I could put more than two pairs of socks and two pairs of underwear in it. I wish I could have given these a good review but I am not a fan of these packing cubes, save your money and get a better set. (I prefer the Shacke pak brand, they hold up much better and have pretty colors as well).",
