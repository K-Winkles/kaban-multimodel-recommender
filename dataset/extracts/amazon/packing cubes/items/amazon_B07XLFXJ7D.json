                "reviewText": "These Bagail packing cubes are fantastic! I purchased the 6 piece set in preparation for a 2 week vacation abroad and they allowed me to fit so much more in my carry-on suitcase.The cubes compress clothes very well to save space. I used the larger cubes for bulkier items like jeans, sweaters and jackets. The slimmer cubes were perfect for t-shirts, undergarments and travel accessories. The mesh top panel makes it easy to see what's inside each cube.The fabric is lightweight yet durable and keeps contents neatly packed. The zippers glide smoothly and the handles make the cubes easy to transport.My clothes stayed organized throughout my trip rather than becoming a jumbled mess in my suitcase. I could quickly grab what I needed on travel days without unpacking everything.These packing cubes helped make packing, transporting and accessing my garments so much simpler. They cut down on luggage clutter and made great use of every inch of space. I will never travel without them again! Highly recommend. 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "Overall - I would rate this 3.5 - 4 stars. I have purchased 2 sets of this and still use them when traveling.***In the picture these bags are the black with gray bands and zipper. The white are another compression bag brand I tried ***The BAGAIL Compression Packing Cubes have proven to be reliable travel companions with some notable strengths and a few minor setbacks, leading to a balanced 3.5-4 star rating.On the positive side, these packing cubes have been a boon for keeping my luggage organized. They are sturdy and well-made, fitting neatly into various travel bags. Cleaning them is a breeze, which adds to their overall convenience. The zippers held up well and didn't give me any trouble during my trips.While the compression feature does work, it didn't quite match up to the best I've experienced. It performed adequately, but did not compress to the level I expected. I found that the level of compression achieved was influenced by the types of clothes I used. Lighter fabrics responded better to compression compared to bulkier items (despite the claims that hoodies in these bags can be 'seriously compressed'... they don't save that much room using these bags)In summary, the BAGAIL Compression Packing Cubes are dependable organizers that fulfill their purpose effectively. The cubes are easy to clean, sturdy, and well-designed, fitting seamlessly into travel bags. While the compression feature is decent, it fell short of the best I've encountered. However, if you are looking strictly for a compression bag...it's important to consider that its effectiveness might vary based on the clothing being packed. If you're seeking efficient packing organizers, these are a great option.",
