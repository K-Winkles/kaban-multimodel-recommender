They are slightly heavier than other sets I have purchased but with good reason: They are also much sturdier and have handles. Others are thin and the zippers keep breaking but these are almost stretchy and held up to 10 days in Ireland. Bought my husband a set a week before we left and quickly purchased myself a set. The beautiful colors and white picture labels are a wonderful bonus.Please save yourself the time of researching and just get these\u2026 I\u2019d purchase them again and recommend in a heartbeat.",

Anyway can only say now that they are so handy and make life so much easier when packing and while away. Sometimes when staying away or travelling there\u2019s not much drawer space and these are great as everything can be left in them and just stacked on an available unit. No more rummaging in the case to find an item. Nicely made and zips seem ok. Most definitely something I didn\u2019t know I needed so much.",
