I typically roll my clothes and then put them in the packing cube, minimizes the wrinkles. I love that my clothes are organized and make it easy to find what I need.

                "reviewText": "Never was really into packing cubes until now! Great variety of sizes for different uses. At first, I thought the material was a bit flimsy but once filled, it feels more sturdy. I would still try not to over pack these as it could rip. Still, a decent price\u2026 Here\u2019s a list of pros/cons.Pros:-Sizes fit everything from shirt, pants, underwear, socks.- great organization- some expansion and easy glide zipper- mesh for breathability- handles for transporting in/out of suitcase- nice colorCons:- can take a bit of stretching to fit shoes. I would probably just use a bigger bag or plastic bag instead.- material is not the thickest and will likely rip or get holes over time.",

                "reviewText": "I like using packing cubes to organize clothing for travel. They make packing and unpacking easier. Living out of a suitcase or duffel bag is *much* easier with the cubes to keep things separate. I even leave smaller clothing like socks and underwear in the cubes when I have a hotel with drawers. Amazon's inexpensive packing cubes have held up well in my travels and their relatively inexpensive cost means I can buy enough to keep everything organized. My wife and I often travel together, so we each have our own color. Even when our stuff ends up mingled for packing, it is easy to separate.",

All shirts in one bag, all underwear in another etc. Or if we knew we'd only stay for one night somewhere, we'd just put everything for the next day into one bag and all we had to take out of the big suitcase that day was that one bag. Totally useful, seem good quality. None of the two sets we got broke or was damaged. Will certainly use again.",

I was a bit hesitant to purchase them at first as I had another set of packing cubes that didn't have good quality. The Amazon Basics packing cubes are actually very durable and good quality for the price. It is a bit cheaper as well compared to some of the other packing cubes listed on Amazon. They aren't the kind of cubes that compress so it won't get smaller but at least keeps your clothes organized. The set of 4 are all the same size so don't expect to have a variety of different sized packing cubes.",
