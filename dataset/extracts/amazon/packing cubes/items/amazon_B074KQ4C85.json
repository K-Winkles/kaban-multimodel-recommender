With three different sizes gets you to think about what you really need to bring with you and what stays at home. No major unpacking once you arrive at your destination ; just keep them as is and slip them into the drawers at your hotel. These appear well constructed and they have a beautiful pattern. Looking forward to putting them to use on my 5 week trip coming up this spring",

                "reviewText": "My husband travels a lot. He is on the road, on average, 3 nights per week. Sometimes he is gone 5 nights. That is a lot of clothes to cram into his Timberland duffel (and he refuses to get a larger bag, or an additional bag). I bought this set because it was in my price point, and had six cubes. I measured his bag, and estimated the way the cubes would fit, and decided to give it a shot.After we finished his laundry, with all of his \"road clothes\"; on the bed, we decided to try packing the cubes. He wears fire retardant jeans, fire retardant long sleeved shirts, and a tshirt every day for work. He then usually changes into gym clothes to work out, and then something casual for dinner. He wears two full outfits (work and gym clothes) each day, and wears the casual dinner outfit twice, usually regular jeans and a polo. NOTE: The fire retardant (FR) clothing is THICK and HEAVY material. It's like duck canvas instead of denim and denim instead of shirt material.Everything is flat folded because he is a philistine and won't let me roll anything:LARGE CUBE: Three pairs of FR jeans OR four pairs of regular jeansMEDIUM CUBE: Four FR shirts OR seven polo shirts OR three dri-fit shirts AND three pairs of basketball shortsSMALL CUBE: Six tshirts OR five pairs of boxer briefs AND five pairs of socks (socks laid flat and not rolled)In each cube, I probably could have crammed a few extras, like tucking in a couple of pairs of socks or underwear with the FR jeans or shirts, etc.The zippers were sturdy, and easy to manage, and the zipper pull was oversized which made it easier to grip.So far, I have sent him on the road several times (for 3-5 days apiece) and this has definitely given him more room in his bag! My daughter is taking a month long trip around the US this summer, so I plan to help her pack everything into just a carryon with these cubes.EDITED: My daughter was able to pack enough clothes for a month-long trip using just three of the packing cubes (one in each size), plus her hygiene and makeup kit...and it all fit in her carryon! She rolled her clothes, and was able to fit more than my husband who leaves his clothes flat folded. She didn't have a problem managing her wardrobe, and often left her clothes in the cubes uncompressed when she was staying with family.I had to take a business trip and have also used the packing cubes, and really like them. I feel like we've gotten a lot of use out of them, and have bought a second set. I have packed my off-season clothing in them and stashed them in a box at the top of my closet, to give me more room! I highly recommend these packing cubes!EDITED 2: We have now had these for just under a year, and they see weekly use when my hubby is on the road. Our daughter and I have used them for \"girls weekends\", too. If we each use a large cube, we can pack all the clothes we need for a three day, two night trip. It slips easily into our respective weekend bags (though honestly, we could get away with just one bag), leaving plenty of room for makeup, hygiene, and jewelry bags, plus our phones and iPads. We often have enough room to bring back treasures from our trips, too. The cubes have very little wear and tear -a bit of the finish on the zipper pulls have worn away, and we had a loose thread on one of the smaller cubes (we burned it to keep it from fraying more).",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for an upcoming trip but I did try out a cube or two for an overnight trip and was impressed. The set comes with multiple sizes so you have what you need for all types of clothing. The zipper was smooth and worked to compress everything easily. I did notice the zipper got stuck the first time I tried to use it, but after some wiggling, I was able to reset it. I haven\u2019t had any problems since then. I also like that the top side is mesh so that it keeps things light and breathable. My partner liked the set enough to buy her own for our upcoming trip so we are excited to give them a real run soon.The material is sturdy enough to give structure to my packing arrangements but also light enough to not add bulk or weight to my suitcase. It will also be easy to wipe off or clean if needed.",

                "reviewText": "The best feature of these cubes is the clam-shell design. You can open up, organize placing clothes and other things where you want them, and the zip up, close the compression zipper, and everything stays in place. Need to remove something? Open the clam-shell and remove the one item without disturbing anything else. We have had a couple other brand-name cube s that zipper down 2/3 of the way so you flip a flap over. When it is time to remove something. all items move and you have to refold and repack everything. The viewing mesh on the top of these cubes also makes it easy to tell which cube has the stuff you are looking for. I liked these so much that after I got a set and packed for my trip to the Caribbean, I ordered my wife a set so she could dump the old sets. Oh, I didn't mention, these cubes have reasonably stiff (but flexible) sides to help keep them as cubes rather than stuff sacks. they seem sturdy and zippers are tough enough to work when compressing a seemingly over-stuffed cube..",
