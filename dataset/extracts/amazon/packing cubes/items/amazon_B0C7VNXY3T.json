AND, Alaska Airlines totally annihilated one hard-side suitcase but everything inside, inside these zipper compartments, was intact, unhurt, and happily secure. I gave a 3 star in durability cuz some of the zippers weren't really sewn in accurately; they have come undone, not through overfilling, they came out of the box a bit frayed. I appreciated the variety of sizes to fit everything we packed. They were useful and will be used again and again as long as they last. Good on, packing cubes (rectangles).",

Once you open and close a couple of the cubes, you realize that you'll just have to be gentle if you want them to last. That goes for the \"sturdy handle\", too.The cubes aren't structured so they're easy to store between trips. Honestly, that's really the only time to use them... either for an RV trip, or if you want to take the cubes out of a suitcase at a hotel to put them into a drawer so that you're not having to go in and out of the suitcase the whole time.Last thought, the different cube sizes are nice. The largest is fairly spacious... holding either 8 men's large t-shirts, or 3 pairs of jeans and 3 pairs of shorts.If partial stars were a thing, I'd probably would give a 3.25-star rating.",
