I couldn't pass up the price when I saw these and knew to expect some imperfections and I'm shocked at how little there is to notice. There are two semi circle of reddish/pink and a slight blue watercolor spot on two of the bags but other then that they were off perfect quality. No structural defects, no odd or bad smells. They are first quality and a steal if you're ordering them for $25. I only actually need 3 of the bags but at this price it was silly to not order the entire set",

                "reviewText": "After 25 years, we decided to replace our luggage set (we obviously haven\u2019t been big travelers, mostly trips by car, maybe only a dozen flights during that time). I went with a highly rated brand of luggage with spinner wheels and retractable handle (SO MUCH EASIER than our previous luggage). I knew that meant less packable space, so I started researching compression packing cubes. We\u2019re a family of five, so I see the possible need for more than one set. There are a number of name brands that different reviewers mention/recommend, so I at least had a selection to look at. I kept coming back to Tripped.Then I stumbled across a discounted listing for Tripped XL compression packing cube 6-piece set (due to light staining). At a reduced price for a recommended brand, I couldn\u2019t pass it up. It arrived quickly and I played with it for a bit. I washed all 6 pieces in cold water on a gentle cycle. I can\u2019t find any staining now!This set on Tripped\u2019s website suggests use in a checked bag. I missed that before ordering. I was just thinking about my chronic overpacking ways when looking at cube sets. (And delighted with a discounted price!)My set includes (per listing):1 laundry/shoe bag1 slim tube2 XL compression cubes\u201416x121 med. compression cube\u201414x10***1 small compression cube\u201410x7***I\u2019ve read some descriptions that don\u2019t list distinct measurements for the medium versus the large bag. This listing says this 14x10 is a medium bag. If I order another set that includes a \u201clarge\u201d bag, will its measurements also be 14x10? I\u2019m not certain.I know a review is more helpful after real-world use. Since I read and watched video reviews recommending these compression cubes, I am not concerned about longevity. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be great!",
