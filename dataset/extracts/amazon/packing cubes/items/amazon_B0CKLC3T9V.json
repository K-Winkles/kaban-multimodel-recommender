You can get a tremendous amount of stuff in a carryon using these. The material is durable and the zippers zip up easily. I like all the sizes and the especially the shoe carrier. No more using small trash bags for your shoes. Everything goes in its place and stays nice and tidy. You will never have an embarrassing mess with stuff spilling out of your suitcase should it come open.",

The set comes with a small, medium and large bag as well as a shoe bag, a delicates bag and a drawstring bag (note: only the small, medium and large bags are compression).The bags are super convenient because they dont require you to have access to a pump or vacuum to compress your clothing. You just unzip it all the way, pack your clothing into it, close it, and then push down on your clothing while zipping the compression portion of the bag. In the pictures you can see that I was able to pack a large winter vest into the smallest of the bags, and I'd say there would still be enough space for some additional items. So with the medium and large ones, there is plenty of space to pack all my travel clothing into it without taking up much luggage space.",

I have the packing for those trips down to a fine art. But the one thing that has always annoyed me is that I have never been able to control the bulkiness of the bag that I take.Now, with this 7 piece set of CtopxCone Compression Packing Cubes, I have an effective way to make the bulkiness of my bags more manageable, and my clothing and toiletries more organised.This set includes 1 small cube, 1 medium cube, 1 large cube, 1 shoe bag, 1 underwear cube, 1 cable organizer, and 1 laundry bag.In addition to making things less bulky and more organised, I can see compressing one\u2019s luggage also being very useful for trips on which you think you are going to come back with more than you left home with.And making sure that the Cubes fit in 20 inch carry-on luggage is another great selling point.I love it when products actually do they say they are going to do, and I am going to recommend this to everyone.Highly recommended.PROS - WHAT I LIKED1. These CtopxCone Compression Cubes effectively compress suitcase contents, thereby reducing bulkiness of the suitcase2. This is very useful for trips when you think that you are going to return with more than you left home with3. The Packing Cubes are designed to fit 20-inch carry-ons and 22-inch luggage - very useful4. The 7 Compression Packing Cubes come in different sizes: 1 small cube, 1 medium cube, 1 large cube, 1 shoe bag, 1 underwear cube, 1 cable organizer, and 1 laundry bag5. All 7 Compression Packing Cubes fold away into a compact and lightweight package with a carrying handleCONS - WHAT I DID NOT LIKE1. These pouches are not water proof or water resistant - this would be an extra selling point",

They were able to withstand a rigorous test when we were travelling to Europe, and they showed no signs of wear and tear.In all seriousness, these are really game-changers. Compressing and saving room in your luggage is made much easier with their assistance. On top of that, everything is organized and simple to recognize. Utilizing these, I was able to travel for a period of two weeks in a foreign country using only my carry-on luggage. A total of twenty t-shirts, five pairs of capris, two pairs of shorts, eight bras, fifteen pieces of underwear, two pairs of pyjamas, and two swimming suits were successfully packed into these bags. Despite the fact that my luggage was not \"puffy\" or overflowing in any way, all of my other belongings, such as my shoes or sandals, beach towel, hairbrush, sunglasses, baseball caps, and so on, were able to fit comfortably on top of the compression packs. What a great thing! Whenever I go anywhere, I will never leave home without these. In addition to being reasonably priced, they are of high quality construction and come in a set of three (one small, one medium, and one large). Those are the kinds of things that I would strongly suggest to anyone. Indeed, they are wonderful.",

                "reviewText": "I received compression cubes from two different companies so had a chance to compare these head to head with another company. In the picture these cubes are on the right hand side. These are made from a lighter material kind of like the material used for folding chair bags or maybe the bag to hold a sleeping bag. I used 3 of the 4 compression bags and in one I put two sweatshirts without hoods, another bag I place two pair of jeans and two dress pants and it was still easy to compress, and in the final one I put 3 three polo shirts in. The largest cube from the other company I was able to put two sweatshirts in and compressing it took some effort to close the second zipper. So if you have not used cubes like this before it is basically the same concept as when your suitcase is over full and you need to get it zipped up so you kneel or get someone to sit on it while you try to zip it up. With the cubes you put your clothes in and zip the first zipper to hold everything the cube. The second is the compression zipper so you basically lean or kneel on the cube and compress it while you try to get the cube zipped up. I realize now that i could have placed more items into the cubes from this company as zipping up the compression zipper was to easy so I really was not compressing much and next time I will definitely fill these cubes with more clothes to get the real benefit of them. These cubes may not be as high quality as other cubes but they are also 40% less and you receive 4 larger size compression cubes than other companies. The other 4 bags don't impress me much in this set. The shoe bag will hold one pair of dress shoes or running shoes. The underwear cube would probably hold a weeks worth but is not compressible. The cable organizer i don't really understand how to use it or how much it would hold. The laundry appears large in the picture but would only hold about 1 sweatshirt, T-shirt, a long sleeved t-shirt, pants, socks, and underwear at most. The ad also shows the bags dramatically compressing the items in the bags which is not even close to how much it really does. I really like the cubes and especially their size and at the price they want I believe them to be reasonable priced.",
