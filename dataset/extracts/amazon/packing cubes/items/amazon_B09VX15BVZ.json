I can't justify the price on some sets I've seen, and the cheaper ones are well ... cheaper in quality. I have a tent from OP and love it. The company appears to offer products in the middle of the road and does not compromise quality for functionality. All of the bags in the set can expand, which is a very welcome feature. The zippers, nylon fabric, and stitching are well done. The handles provide easy access, and the sizes available in the set provide versatility in the types of items to be stored. I would absolutely recommend this over any high end brand or cheap non-brand.",

                "reviewText": "I got these because I often travel into the woods to go camping. I used to put all of my things in one bag until I saw these. These have been one of the most timesaving, helpful, and organizational backpacking \"tools\" that I have every bought. They made everything so much easier and quicker, especially when it comes to packing/unpacking in mornings and evenings. I really like that they have zippers on both sides; one to open each pack, and the other to make the bag bigger. I have loved these and if your contemplating buying them, DO IT!!!! You will not regret it.",
