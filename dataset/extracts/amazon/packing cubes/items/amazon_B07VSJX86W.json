        "description": "Pack More Clothes in a Small Space For Your Next TripOne of the toughest things to do while packing for a trip is fitting everything you want to bring with you into your luggage. Our packing cube system fixes that issue by neatly packing all your clothes tightly into our space saving bags. It allows you to easily store and organize your clothing that makes it easy to pack and even easier to unpack. Your clothes will stay more wrinkled free and not get crushed during your travels. Shacke Pak is made with a high quality durable water resistant nylon material built to withstand the wear and tears of travel. It is reinforced with a X-Design web stitching made specifically to prevent the fabric from folding in the middle, allowing for a more secure packing experience. Our bags are 4 inch deep giving you enough space to pack more clothing. Finally, we use high quality zippers for a smooth and sturdy use. Shacke Pak Overview:-5 Packing Cubes - 4 x Medium (13.75x9.75x4) 1 x Small (11\" x 6.75\" x 4\")How to care for your packing cubes: - Hand washing cubes is the best way to ensure the cubes do not get damaged - Wash only with cold water - Hang dry only - DO NOT put the cubes in the washing machine, even if it is on gentle or delicate cycle - DO NOT put fabric conditioner of any kind",

                "reviewText": "POST-TRIP UPDATE - May 13, 2017We just got back from using these cubes on a 14 day trip to Italy. We easily stand by the 5 star rating. Great product and it really helped in our organization of the clothing and accessories. I look forward to using them on any trip. Smart way to travel and does not add much weight but really keeps thing neat and organized when you open your bag when you get to your destination.Outstanding value for the quality of this packing cube set. I got the four and one set (4 medium and 1 small). They are perfectly sized for my trip. The quality is better than we expected. We have three other brands of packing cube sets; this one wins. We have an Eagle Creek set (ne small bag, one medium, and one folder thing), and the other two cube sets have no official brand name since we bought them on Ebay. One of them from Ebay is useable but wimpy and says \"Is My Dress too much?\" on one side. The other packing cube set from Ebay is really excellent quality also for the money we paid; just a different fabric, and no YKK zips but not a big deal. This second Ebay set is the exact same as this one on Amazon, which gets very good ratings (https://www.amazon.com/BAGSMART-Breathable-Travel-Packing-Cubes/dp/B00QTFRL70/ref=sr_1_33?ie=UTF8&qid=1490045267&sr=8-33&keywords=packing+cubes). In conclusion though the fabric on the Shacke Pak is nicer and so I think the Shacke Paks are just better made. YKK zippers slide nicely and are strong. Good stitching and the handle is a little nicer than the Eagle Creek, slightly so. But Eagle Creek is way too much ($40) for the very small differences. The Shacke Pak is made as good as the Eagle Creek. Both come with a lifetime warranty. I think that is kind of funny though - a \"lifetime warranty\" on a packing cube! Good luck to us all on that one.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased several sets of these packing cubes. We went on our first travel adventure of the year and used them to pack. I have 2 colors, so they are color coded. One color for the hubby and another for me. They worked great! The hubby wasn't rummaging through everything to find something to wear and I knew what he was wearing would not clash:-) I always pack everything, so I simply put an outfit in each cube. Rolled everything up and everything fit nicely. We have a longer trip coming up, so I'll be ordering a few more sets. I would recommend these for anyone that wants to stay organized.",

                "reviewText": "Even though I travel quite often for work and pleasure, I had never used packing cubes. Decided to purchase for use during a week long cruise after a friend raved about using them. After comparing other brands and styles and reading reviews, I settled on these. Generally speaking, packing cubes are a great investment. This pack in particular I think was a pretty good value for the price. The pack I ordered came with 4 medium cubes and 1 small one for about $26. The medium cubes stacked nicely in my mid-size rolling suitcase and helped to keep me organized during the trip. I packed my cubes according to apparel type - all my tees/tanks/tops in one, pants/shorts in another, dresses were in a third, bathing suits and beach cover ups in the fourth. Another option would be to pack the cubes in outfits, just depends on your style/needs. They definitely hold much more than you would expect - for example 1 medium cube held 3 pairs of women's bermuda-style khaki shorts, 2 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of pants, a pair of leggings, and a sweater. I used the smallest cube for all my undergarments but that could have also been used for misc accessories, electronics cords, toiletries, etc. The only things I packed \"loose\" in my suitcase were shoes and some random items that were too big for my makeup/toiletries case.Pros for this specific make and model of packing cubes - affordable, lightweight, breathable mesh panels, sized just right. Cons - need handles on both long and short ends (just on long side on these) and mesh panels on sides so you can see what is inside regardless of how you choose to stack them. Also would prefer a cube with a little more structure/firmer bottom or sides for easier packing. Overall I would definitely recommend these!",
