                "reviewText": "I never pack light! So packing cubes are a must so I can fit everything in. Why leave stuff behind when I can use these to organize and save space?This is what I was looking for with these packing cubes:\u2705 Strong, smooth zippers - these packing cubes use good quality zippers. They open and close easily, with no apparent catch points other than my own clothes.\u2705 \u274c Durable seams, no loose stitching - I need packing cubes that will hold up well under pressure. The stitching appears to be fine for the most part, but I found a few cases where the stitching looked to be starting to pull and in one case, the stitching had already come apart. Not sure how long that seam will last until I will need to sew it up.\u2705 Easy to clean - the description says these packing cubes are hand wash only. Usually I insist on machine washable items only, but luggage cubes don\u2019t pick up a lot of grime in the first place. So to occasionally throw it in the sink and swish it around isn\u2019t a deal breaker for me here.\u2705 \u274c Durable material - two of the smaller packing cubes are padded, so that offers extra protection for the contents, as well as making it more resistant to tears. The remaining seven cubes are made out of a single layer of a synthetic (polyester?) material with some mesh. The material is rather thick for being a single layer. It feels much like the material of a windbreaker jacket. Although the material feels like it would hold up well over many trips, I did spot one place where it looks like the material got snagged and damaged during manufacturing. This tells me the material may not be tear resistant, so anything possibly sharp, like belt buckles and underwires, should be protected while packing.\u2705 Good variety of sizes - with nine different packing cubes, there are many options. For a weekend away at the cottage, I was able to fit two days of clothes in the largest cube, plus use the two padded accessories bags for additional items.Overall I find these packing cubes to be quite acceptable. Although I spotted a few tiny flaws with stitching and material that could create issues after using many times, I can\u2019t forget that the current list price is $36 for nine pieces, so that works out to $4 each, which is an incredible value.",
