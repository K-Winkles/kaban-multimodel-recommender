                "reviewText": "The Compression Packing Cubes for Suitcase have revolutionized the way I travel, and I couldn't be happier! These cubes are an absolute must-have for anyone who loves efficiency and wants to pack smarter.First of all, they make packing a breeze. I used to dread packing, but now I actually enjoy it. The cubes help me stay organized, and the transparent panels let me see what's inside each one. No more rummaging through my suitcase to find that one item buried at the bottom.But what truly sets these packing cubes apart is their compression feature. They work like magic, allowing me to pack more clothes than I ever thought possible. The double zippers compress the contents, creating space I didn't know I had. It's like having a mini vacuum-sealed bag for each cube, and it's a game-changer when it comes to fitting everything I need into my suitcase.The benefits don't stop there. These cubes keep my clothes wrinkle-free, and they're incredibly durable, so I don't have to worry about wear and tear. Plus, they're lightweight, so they don't add any unnecessary bulk to my luggage.In short, the Compression Packing Cubes for Suitcase are a traveler's dream come true. They make packing easy, let you pack more, and create space where you thought there was none. If you're looking to streamline your packing and make your travels more organized and stress-free, I can't recommend these cubes enough. They're an absolute essential for any globetrotter.",

                "reviewText": "These are exactly what I wanted!! Here\u2019s the summary but keep reading if you like juicy details:\u2022 Great quality zippers and fabric - I don\u2019t worry about it tearing when I\u2019m zipping the compression (but probably still smart to do so carefully)\u2022 LOVE the size options - perfect for organizing by type of clothing and easier to Tetris into luggage than more typical ones\u2022 love the little pockets included at the bottom of the smallest cubes - didn\u2019t even know it had those but will come in handy!\u2022 it\u2019s easy to be tempted to overfill because it seems so roomy when it\u2019s not compressed, but just remember that the compression feature isn\u2019t magic. But it\u2019s also nice that if you do want to overfill and not compress you can too. Choose your own adventure!I\u2019ve been shopping for compression cubes for months now and had a million different ones sitting in my cart, but was too afraid to commit to a set because I was worried it wouldn\u2019t be THE one. I already have two sets of pretty standard packing cubes but have never really loved them, so if I was going to spend $30+ for something I didn\u2019t really need I wanted to love it!!Well, due to an upcoming trip and me running out of time I was forced to choose one, and these were love at first sight! It has all of the features I wanted and they are great quality. The thing I\u2019ve never liked about my old packing cubes is how big they are, because I always had to mix clothes together that I didn\u2019t want to mix (ie swimsuits with pajamas, shirts with bottoms, etc). It was also a pain to pack because the biggest size always took up almost an entire side of the suitcase and really limited what else you could add to that side. These cubes, in my opinion, are PERFECT because you can organize more strategically with the smaller options and pack Tetris style to fit way more. I also love that there\u2019s a little clear pocket on the top of the cube to add a label for each cube for what\u2019s inside!I didn\u2019t think I needed a laundry bag because I usually just bring a garbage bag with me for that, but this will be much classier (ha).As I mentioned above, it\u2019s tempting to overfill because it seems like there\u2019s still so much room left when it\u2019s not compressed, but that feature isn\u2019t magic so just be mindful of that when packing them. But it\u2019s always an option to just stuff it full uncompressed!Anyway, there\u2019s always a risk that you\u2019ll get a damaged product but in my opinion, you will be happy with this purchase!!",

I was really impressed by how easily I could pack 2 puffy vests PLUS a couple of turtlenecks into a single large compression bag. The zippers easily opened and closed. I rolled my turtlenecks and when I unpacked them, I had only a few wrinkles. Full disclosure - I did wear a pair of boots and my winter coat on the plane. I have since used all six to pack for a trip to NY, also in winter so the clothes were bulky. .I also needed a more diverse wardrobe for the activities we chose, including some clothes that were a bit dressier. Again, I was happy to open the compression bag and find my clothes needed only a quick steam to be completely wrinkle-free.",

When it came to compression packing cubes...I figured Bagsmart seems to be pretty high quality stuff so decided on this brand. Forget even the fact that these do some compression, I have never EVER been so organized in a small carry on luggage in my entire life. Usually by the 3rd day or so al my stuff/clothes are hard to find. Not so with these cubes...at the least they keep you very organized...at the best they DO compress the clothing a bit but maybe more Like just 50% ish. It's not like night and day as to flat vs puffy, BUT they do work. I loved the bright color too on these things...zippers held up well construction seems well made and light. Overall I'd day this was an excellent overall must have purchase...if you want to be more organized AND bring more STUFF you normally could not...compression does help to a degree.",
