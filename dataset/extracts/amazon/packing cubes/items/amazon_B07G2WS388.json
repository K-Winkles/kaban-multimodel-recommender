                "reviewText": "These worked ok for me. I liked the cloth bags, particularly because of the straps. However, I only used them once or twice before the zipper broke on one of them. I use the underwear bag for shoes and that works great (I can fit two pairs in it). I don't like all the writing on the bags, but that may just be a personal preference.The makeup and toiletry bags were useless for me. The makeup bag is mesh on the front, so unless you want to get product all over your suitcase, you'll also need to put your makeup in a plastic bag. The toiletry bags are too small for toiletries. The laundry bags are too small for laundry unless you are going on a VERY short trip.TLDR: Pretty good bags, but a little flimsy. Some of the bags don't work well for what they're supposed to be for but are still usable for other things.",
