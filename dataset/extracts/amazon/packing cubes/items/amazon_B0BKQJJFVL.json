                "reviewText": "Osprey quality but far to expensive , however i do think a size xl bag should be made and included to make a four pack of cubes which would balance the cash books better.This review will bias towards men/mens clothing.The size large bag is basically big enough to hold six rolled up cotton t-shirts in without any strain on the bag, another one can be placed on top, although any more than this will start to sit unevenly and loose the benefit of the cube.medium is pretty versatile and definitely useful for different trip durations and items of clothing.Size small can fit in six pairs of boxer shorts without straining the bag.Problems - Size large isn't big enough for chino shorts or jeans.Chino shorts fold but don't roll well and jeans roll well but are slightly too wide.Solution - Low alpine make a slightly bigger bag and i am getting one.Overall - glad i purchased them and they will be used for every trip i go on but shop around to get the best combination and the best price.Updated solution - snugpak packcubes, wider range of sizes, decent quality and affordable. I wasn't aware of these before purchasing the opsrey product.If your packing a rucksack then a choice of sizes will be best as the large 6 litre snugpak cube fits but not overly well in a standard 65 litre rucksack. No fit issues in a suitcase.",
