                "reviewText": "Based on the pictures, I thought these packing cubes had some \"structure\" to them - meaning that there might be a small amount of foam in the sides/bottom to help them hold their shape. They do not. They are similar to all the other non-compression packing cubes out there. They seem to be well-enough made, but since they aren't compressing and don't have any structure, I suggest saving some $$ and buying one of the other brands available. I really like Briggs products, but I don't see that these are worth the extra money just to get the Briggs name. Add some something to help them keep their shape and/or add a compression feature and I might reconsider.",

First impressions, they're not much different from the cheaper sets, the largest of the bags being plain plastic tat' and with only a months use, they're coming apart just as quickly as far cheaper packing sets. So for me, it's back to the cheap and cheerful and I'll simply replace them every few months, as I've been doing for many years now",
