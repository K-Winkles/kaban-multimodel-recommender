                "reviewText": "Purchased these for an out of state 4 day trip, I was able to fit the following in each, 6 full outfits plus pj's for my husband in the large bag (keep in mind he's 6/1 so his bottoms are long and they take up space), 5 outfits plus pj's for myself in the medium bag for myself, 5 pairs of underwear for the husband in the smallest bag, 6 pairs of underwear, 4 bras and 5 wash cloths in the small bag for myself, 2 full body bathing suits 2 top pieces one pair of lake pants, water shorts, & three cover ups in another bag & one pair of shoes in the shoe bag. I usually travel with a whole luggage set with the large medium & small suitcase's plus two additional travel bags for a similar trip... Not this time... I only carried the large suitcase with my Modoker travel bag and my Large Tote Bag and everything fit perfectly. These are such space savers and help keep your clothes nice and organized. I love the straps 3 of the bags have inside they help with keeping everything compressed and in place. When I received them I was like well they looked a lot bigger online you'll get a good kick of how small they are when you open them but trust me when you put everything together it just works. Zippers and bags are heavy duty in my opinion I mean trust me I don't pack light. Thinking of purchasing another set for a future longer trip where I will definitely need a second suitcase. My traveling techniques get better and better each time. These kinds of things are of much help. Also I saw a couple of reviews saying not to buy because they take up space in your luggage... On the contrary they allow you to pack a lot. Packing everything as neatly as possible is key Folding everything as small as possible helps a lot as well. That's how I do it!",

I didn't use the zippered or the dirty laundry bag it came with (not enough room) but everything else I was able to use and it helped out so much, oh my goodness. Instead of making a huge mess in the suitcase by trying to find what I wanted to wear, I just had to find the bag that I needed, take that out, get the clothes out of it & put it back into the suitcase! Easy peasy!!! And it's pink, what's not to love about it !! I STUFFED those bags and they held up so good traveling! I love that you can secure the clothes as well with that clip, that really came in handy!",

They\u2019re solid, if you need it, and I guess a good value for your buck because you get so many for one but still\u2026 perhaps consider getting a higher quality one if you\u2019re looking for something to last you a while.",

                "reviewText": "These kept me organized during my entire trip.I like that most of them are transparent so that you can see your items in the bags. It makes it easier for tsa and for me when I\u2019m looking for certain items. They also include a bag that isn\u2019t see through, I used that for my jewelry and glasses as an example. (I poured my jewelry out for the picture to show you an example). There\u2019s also a pull string bag that worked great for holding my dirty clothes. The capacity isn\u2019t huge, however for me I had a washer and dryer at my Airbnb so it wasn\u2019t an issue. I would bring an extra bag for dirty clothes since that one isn\u2019t too big. There\u2019s also a sheer liquids bag. Before going to korea I had my liquids and medicine in that bag which made it super easy to locate them. But I ended up using it for my receipts and tickets from events I went to. It\u2019s a great little storage to have for anything. I used the biggest bag for my shoes. During my trip I think I took 5 shoes options (tennis shoes, 2 heels, flats, sandals) and they all fit into the bag.The only issue I had, that honestly isn\u2019t a big deal if you\u2019re patient, was that the zipper can get stuck on the fabric. There\u2019s also some loose stitching. However, I really don\u2019t mind it since they are just bags to use for my belongings during traveling. Overall I really enjoyed these bags. I felt really secure having them. Usually stuff is moving all about inside the suitcase but with these you can stay organized and protect your items.I would recommend if you\u2019re looking for something affordable to keep your belongings in for domestic or international travel. I used these for Vegas and South Korea and they survived 3 long weeks of me going through them over and over.(There are 7 bags but i don\u2019t know where I put the 7th one, oops)",

I used them to go on a four-day trip and the bags held up great and were easy to organize; I've watched YouTube on folding clothes which helped. Will be ordering another set to use when I go in September to Italy. Last time traveling with just the suitcase packed, the zipper broke on the suitcase and my clothes were dragging on the conveyor belt. Hopefully folding and packing using the travel bags, there won't be a conveyor belt incident.",
