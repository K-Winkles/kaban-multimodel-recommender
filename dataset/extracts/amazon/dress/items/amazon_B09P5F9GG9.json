And it has pockets - which I need - mom here and I need kleenexes and my phone on me and don't usually get my own purse because I'm stuck with a diaper bag. It isn't see through at all and it was not too heavy for the heat of Mexico. I loved the blue but the other colors weren't really me otherwise I'd own it in multiple colors!",

                "reviewText": "It's soft and flowy but still flattering. It has legit pockets. Not those cheapo pockets you can't put things in. Adjustable button straps. For my height (5'4\" AND A HALF) It's the perfect midi length - not too short. I can't get over how comfortable the fabric is. I havent washed it yet, but so far I'm in love. I purchased the mushroom color.EDIT: over a year later...I've worn and washed it many times and I'm still in love with this dress. Holds up well in the wash and I even toss it in the dryer. No noticeable shrinkage. Color has held up well but it has faded from normal wash and wear just a little (to be expected). Noteworthy: it is kind of a heavy material (densely woven fabric...good quality) so it isn't super cool above 80\u00b0F weather, it got a little heavy and hot...but I still adore this dress and have purchased it in other colors over the course of the year.",

                "reviewText": "I now own this dress in two colors and absolutely LOVE it. I have black and mushroom. I bought the black first a size or two up because I have a pear shape figure and the hip rarely fits me if I go by the bodice size of a dress. I could have gone true to size here bc the cut of the skirt is fuller- super flowy and fun\u2026 with pockets! The bodice in the larger size is super big but I will alter it down instead of exchange bc I love the flow of the skirt.The color of the mushroom is lighter in the model photos. I\u2019m glad I took a chance on it! My photo is the mushroom color next to an Amazon box and an off/white tray in warm lighting to help you gauge the color. It is deeper and warmer than the model photos. I went true to size in this color and the skirt is still flowy and fun.Until I alter the gap under the arms, I\u2019ll wear a lightweight blouse tied at the waist.Pros:Fabric! Gorgeous natural fiber, soft, nice drape, breathes/coolAdjustable strapsPocketsFlowy skirtElastic back for ease and movementLengthCons:The top gaps on the sides (under the arms) *so much* no matter the size (hence the 4 stars). Despite the fabric being a non-stretch woven, the pattern could\u2019ve been cut to avoid this- especially with the elastic back. Make it fitted and add an elastic back, or do neither- both is redundant.",

There are so many wonderful things about this dress.It has pockets! The straps can be shortened and can be crisscrossed in the back for a different look. I am 5'3 so I will have it shortened 5-6 inches. I like my dresses to hit mid calf. I usually wear a 22/24 dress size and purchased the 3X. I could have gone with the 2X. You can wear a shirt underneath if you desire.The material is soft and very comfortable. I purchased this dress during Prime Days and got a great price.This dress would be a fun addition to your summer wardrobe.",

I got many compliments on the royal blue color, and the length looked nice with strappy sandals. I was concerned about the neckline, but it was high enough that it didn't display too much me when I sat down. Because of the strappy top, I usually wore a light sweater when we went to air conditioned eateries. The pockets were a big plus for carrying small items. The stretchy bodice was form fitting enough to be flattering and loose enough to be comfortable. I used the extra buttonholes on the straps to adjust the length of the straps, so I didn't need to move any buttons. I would buy this again.",

La spallina copre benissimo il reggiseno e ha anche tre bottoncini che consentono di regolare la lunghezza e la profondit\u00e0 dello scollo a perfezione. Io non sono molto alta, tuttavia pur essendo lungo non ho ravvisato la necessit\u00e0 di farlo accorciare dalla sarta. Il colore che ho preso \u00e8 bellissimo, un delicato beige che per\u00f2 non \u00e8 smorto ma molto elegante e un evergreen che sono sicura rester\u00e0 molto tempo nel mio armadio. Da vacanza ma anche da citt\u00e0 (ovviamente magari non per l'ufficio) sar\u00e0 un compagno di uscite molto confortevole anche per la presenza di due taschine laterali. Super raccomandato!",
