                "reviewText": "Quickly have become a Grace Karin fan!! I was very hesitant to order this dress but decided if I didn't like it, my daughter probably would. This one is a winner, and I was tickled when I tried it on. Probably one of my favorite things I have ordered in a while. Love the soft light blue color. Sizing chart was right on, and fit is perfect. I am 5'5 and approx 145-150 lbs, usually wear around an 8/10 and prefer things to be a little bigger rather than too tight, and ordered a medium in this following the chart. This dress is so very flattering. I do wish there was some extra lining or pads in the chest area- something to maybe give the appearance of being more perky- but the material is surprisingly not see through so at least I don't have to worry about that. I am a tad larger than I prefer in my midsection and do not have pronounced/shapely hips, but the cut of the dress is just great, doesn't make my belly look pudgy or pregnant, and is just such a cute dress to wear during the summer, on a beach trip, for Easter, whatever. Great buy!",

                "reviewText": "I can't find a way to wear this that doesn't look ridiculous? It's sooo frilly and so pink! I feel like I'm wearing a tablecloth from a 6-year old girl's princess themed birthday party and that just isn't my style....at all!The torso is very short so it is especially unflattering on anyone taller than 5'1. Then, all the many layers of flowy fabric are piled on top of each other in such a way that they just have nowhere to go that doesn't look excessive. My photos tone down just how poofy this actually looks irl. It's worse in person, trust me.Also, there's nothing \"dusty\" about this pink. It's artificially dyed raw salmon from that shady sashimi section of the grocery store.I find Grace Karin brand to be pretty hit and miss (mostly miss for me) for thinner framed people 5'5\" and taller. Their smalls run large and wide and a lot of their dresses tend to have shorter torsos which are really unflattering imo. They don't seem to sell xs or things tailored for skinny people. At least, that's been my experience with what I have tried from them.",

I also wasn't sure if it would look too formal, but the style will look great for any occasion. This isn't a pink dress, though, which I could tell before ordering. It's more of a rusty color, and I like it.",
