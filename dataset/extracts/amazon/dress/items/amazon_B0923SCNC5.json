                "reviewText": "This is might be the best item of clothing I have bought on Amazon and possibly the most comfortable dress I've ever worn.I bought 3 different colors because I wasn't sure which one I would like best. Ended up keeping the blue because the fit was slightly looser and the material was softer than the pink and yellow.The dress is lined so you can't see through, but the sleeves and very bottom of the dress are sheer. I would still wear nude underwear with this. The lining is very silky and I haven't had any issues with static, riding up, etc.I am on the shorter side so it goes a little past my knees but I like that. I also like that it's a breathable neckline without showing cleavage. I can wear a regular bra with it as well which is great.I'm 13 weeks pregnant in the pictures, 5'3, 163 lbs. Bra size is a 36 DD. Largest bust measurement is 41. Pant size Large, 12. Top size medium-large. Dress fits very well with lots of room for my stomach and I can imagine this will still fit when I'm further along. Bust area has some room to grow into as well, but the size large was perfect for me.I haven't washed it yet, so I can't speak to that, but I'm super excited about this pretty dress that I could wear all day!Also, the blue print that I got has brown in it. I didn't realize that when I bought it but i still like it. Not noticeable from far away. I added a picture of the pattern in bad lighting.Edit: I washed the dress in cold water and air dried, turned out fine no issues!",

I hate that I don\u2019t have a better picture of the front of the dress, but I love the fact that the v-neck is not too low - it showed no cleavage, I didn\u2019t have to pull it up at all during all our multiple pose pics! I am about 183 lbs, 5\u20193, 38D with a momma belly and ordered an XL. I might\u2019ve been able to fit a L, but I think it might\u2019ve been a little too tight toward the top, as this dress really doesn\u2019t have stretch. It\u2019s a great length, very flattering and just the right amount of flowy! Makes me feel super confident while still trying to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight. Buy it!",

                "reviewText": "I loved the print and the colors are beautiful! Lightweight chiffon which is perfect for the summer. Fully lined. The hem of the dress and sleeves is an overlock stitch which is very common for this type of fabric. I was a professional seamstress and saw this all the time. It is a way to keep a nice soft flowing edge because folding it over and stitching it makes it a little stiffer, and then it doesn't drape as well.The lining is shorter than the actual skirt length. There is an inset ruffle under the bust line and I felt like this was not flattering on my body type. I am 5'8\", 135 lb and wear a small or 3/5. This fit true to size. I think the dress is cute. It just doesn't look good on me. I felt like it took away my curves and gave me no shape.",

                "reviewText": "I almost kept this dress. But it wasn't great. Just okay. I ordered two dresses for an upcoming wedding and I liked the look of this one so much. But the tipping point for me returning it is when I held it up on a hanger in my bedroom I could clearly see the picture on my wall through the dress. Sure I could've found a slip, but I was already on the fence about it.It was cute and flattering which is why I almost kept it, but it wasn't made great. One of the shoulders had a large bunch in the sewing and there were a handful of loose threads. And it felt slightly off center. Also the lining layer was suuuper short. Like I'm not sure i could've sat properly without the under side riding up. And the sleeves hit my elbow, which bothered me a smidge. I wanted them to rest slightly above it. None of these things were major by themselves, but when I realized that I could see straight through two layers it was enough to make me return it.If you have a slip and don't mind tiny imperfections this dress would be great. Since I had ordered two dresses I simply went with the other one, but I could've made this one work.I am 5'3\", 165#, with a large chest and I ordered the large and it fit.",

Bought an XL which fit snugly but not uncomfortably across the bust, and came to my knees (which I prefer). A larger size would have been too big.I think the thin model in the pic doesn't do justice to the dress. It looks better on curvy women!Four stars because the material was a little thinner than I expected, so the satiny liner gave the dress an odd shine that I noticed. Others didn't so it isn't bad.",
