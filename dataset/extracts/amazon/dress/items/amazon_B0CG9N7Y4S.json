Stretchy and thick material, no see-through issues and fabric seems durable. For me at least, the tightness around the chest and arms, coupled with the fact this it is definitely short, meant that I needed to size up. It's short enough that you don't need to worry about it being awkwardly long at a larger size, it will definitely still be a mini dress. Can be dressed up or down.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5'4\" and probably around 118-120 lbs and I ordered both a size Small and size Medium. The Small was very tight and a little hard to get on and off, but the material is stretchy so if I was wanting something skin tight it would have been doable. I returned the Small and kept the Medium since the fit was a little less compression like (compared to the small) and allowed me more room to breathe (lol). Also since there's a slit in this, I felt like the length of the Medium was a little better where it came up on the Small. Love the square neck line but it's a little low where I felt like I kinda needed to keep an eye on pulling it up so that my strapless bra didn't show. Would work better with a strapless bra with low-profile cupping or probably pasties/stickies, preferably!",

                "reviewText": "I share in what other reviewers say about how sturdy the fabric is. This dress does compress well and isn't visually see through. I am, however, returning it for the following reasons:It's not VISUALLY see-through, but the fabric is so tight you can see any shapewear or underwear underneath it, barring maybe like a full unitard, which I don't own. The muffintop at the top of tights would also show :(I can't wear a proper bra, which would be nice at my size and build. The square neckline is very wide and the bra will show no matter what. I do like the styling of a wide neck, and I think it keeps the dress from being too boring, but with how unforgiving the tight fabric is I don't feel confident letting my tig ol biddies do whatever they want. The seem to want to sit in my armpits in this dress.On me, this comes VERY short. XL is my standard size--there was nothing for me to size up to--and I feel like more size options would've made me exchange this instead of returning it.If you're midsized (US size 12) or smaller and comfortable with little-to-no structure underneath,, this is a well-constructed and gorgeous little dress. You should size up for more breathing room!The airy blue is true to color and very feminine and flattering. I'll come back if they ever add more sizes!",

The material is thick but comfortable. The length is perfect for me, not to short not too long (keep in mind, I\u2019m 5\u2019). I would call the sleeves compressing vs tight. My arms are a little thick and the sleeves made them look slim. I can\u2019t wait to get the XL!!! I would definitely do two sizes up if you are big chested. I\u2019m on the sm/md boob size and they barely fit.",
