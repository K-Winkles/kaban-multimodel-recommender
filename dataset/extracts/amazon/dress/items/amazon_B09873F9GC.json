I was pleasantly surprised because it is actually quite flattering.I'm in decent shape, but over 40, so clothes don't always fit like they used to. It's a little loose (adjustable straps-yay!) without looking tent-like, and it falls to a nice flattering length on the leg. The lining is nice. It's maybe slightly itchy/irritating where my upper arms rub against the outside of the dress, but you have to expect that with sequins. I paired it with sparkly boots and a fluffy purple jacket for the costume, but I would actually wear this dress to go salsa dancing or something.",

It has lining so it's not itchy underneath the dress and it seems well made.

                "reviewText": "I bought this dress for a costume and was hoping it would look good enough to wear to nicer events too. Unfortunately, the sequins on the red dress are red on one side and silver on the other, and the mix of red and silver on the dress makes it look cheap.I felt like one of those sequin pillows where if you swipe your hand across one way, it's a solid color but when you swipe the other way, there's a design (Google \"sequin pillow\" if you don't know what I'm talking about). It's especially noticeable around the seams because those are sewn such that you can't flip them to the red side (see photos). Based on photos from other reviews, this might just be an issue with the red dress and not other colors.Otherwise, the fit and construction were fine. The straps are adjustable and feel sturdier than other sequin dresses I've tried on. The dress is on the thinner side but it's lined and comfortable. Just might not be what I'm looking for. I'm 5'2\" and ~117 lbs, wearing XS in the photos.",

I\u2019m size 14, sometimes medium or large in more generous-sized brands/size xl in more fitted, truer-sized brands, and smaller chested (38c) . I got a size XL in this dress and it was perfect\u2014slightly showed my shape, but draped over my problem areas (stomach/hips). I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and this hit a few inches above my knees, which was great as longer dresses make me look shorter. I did lengthen the straps almost to their limit as leaving them shorter was going to flash everyone every time I sat down. That being said, even with the straps lengthened, I still wore 5\u201d bike shorts with pockets underneath just in case of accidental flashing and also to have pockets since the dress has none. The straps felt sturdy enough, and a strapless bra worked great underneath. I had zero issues with the sequins bothering my arms/body. Though, I did notice some loose threads coming off some sequins, no actual sequins were lost despite an entire night of dancing and crowd maneuvering. I paired my dress with all-white Vans and heart earrings, and I loved how my outfit looked! I didn\u2019t feel too hot in this dress either, despite temps in the mid-80s. The inside was lined and super comfortable. Lastly, the color was perfect to fit the Lover look I was going for\u2014truly a light pink (back of sequins was silver, though hardly any stayed flipped that way), with rose gold straps/edging. As a bonus, I\u2019ll likely get more uses out of this dress! 100% recommend! \ud83d\udc95",

                "reviewText": "Okay obviously I got this for the Eras tour but what I didn\u2019t know was how different it would photograph in the sunlight!! It was practically white (but shimmery) inside, and then a bright iridescent purple/blue/pink in the sun. Could not have asked for a better color!!The fit\u2026it runs big for sure. I initially ordered a large because I didn\u2019t want it to be tight, especially around my problem areas but then I exchanged for a medium and it was still a tad big around the armpit area. I brought safety pins to use but didn\u2019t end up needing them because I liked how it still wasn\u2019t tight but it fit me better.So it depends how you want it to fit\u2026if you want it form-fitting, size down. If you want to have a bit of room, go for your normal size. If you want it looser (or if you want to choose where it\u2019s tighter), size up and use safety pins!In terms of comfort, there was a silk slip inside so I never felt uncomfortable sequins rubbing against my skin. However, I didn\u2019t sit in this dress much at all\u2026I wore it to the concert, but didn\u2019t sit in my seat at all the whole night, and walked most of the way to the stadium and back so someone else may have a different opinion. But I still think the silk slip inside was perfect for comfort!Also get this color \ud83d\ude0d what a dream!Edit: forgot to mention, it definitely is short so I had to keep that in mind all night if I had to bend down to tie my shoe, pick something up, etc. Also I machine washed it inside out on the delicate setting and hung to dry, and no issues.",

The straps are adjustable and the length is great if you\u2019re under 5\u20195\u201d (a few inches below the booty). Overall a good buy, with a few issues:I bought it for my bachelorette and the white/pink color is completely pink and not white at all.And if you\u2019re pear or hourglass shaped it will completely make your waist disappear and create a very boxy look. It isn\u2019t easy to tailor so you\u2019re stuck with that shape unless you can find a belt to go with it.",
