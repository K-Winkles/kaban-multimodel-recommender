It look great on her as well!I was pleasantly surprised by the price and overall fit. The material is quality and the color is beautiful. It fit perfectly in my chest and was very flowing/flattering in the mid section. The adjustable straps were helpful as well. The only negative comment is the belt was difficult to stay up. There is not a loop on each side of the dress to help keep the belt secure. Overall I am very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I initially bought the burgundy version of this dress, because the photos showed a deep wine/burgundy color. But as you can see, it\u2019s actually more of a true red with blue undertones. In some light, it does look darker but it\u2019s not what I wanted. I then ordered the red, and I\u2019m really happy with it! It\u2019s a warmer red with orange undertones and I think it looks better on my olive skin. The dress itself is very flattering on my body (5\u20199, 170 lbs, ordered size L, 35\u201d waist but can fit into 31\u201d-36\u201d clothes). The back of the dress is smocked and is overall stretchy and comfortable. The fabric doesn\u2019t feel cheap to me; it\u2019s lightweight and has a nice drape to it. It can definitely be dressed up with nice shoes and jewelry or dresses down with sneakers and a jacket. I\u2019m wearing it to the Jonas Brothers concert and taking it on vacation to Portugal. Oh and it\u2019s much easier to get the straps right when someone else ties them for you, otherwise it\u2019s impossible to get them tight enough/even on both sides.",

Fits perfect, not see through, adjustable tie straps, I absolutely love it and will order in other colors as it is perfect for a wide range of occasions. I am 5\u20196\u201d, 140lbs, and 36DD and the small was a perfect fit. It does come wrinkled from shipping/packaging so it will need to be ironed, steamed, or dry cleaned prior to wearing. Great price, fast shipping, lots of compliments as well. Ummm. I just noticed that I didn\u2019t receive the tie for this dress. It has a tie in the photo but I didn\u2019t have one. I still love it but would have lived even more with the tie.",

I ordered it for a wedding and while it was bit more casual than the pictures (I wouldn't call it elegant), it can be dressed up. From the photos, I wasn't able to tell the fabric was pretty light weight and the back was smocked - again, it added to the comfort, but made it a bit more casual. I still felt totally fine wearing it at a country club wedding, and was able to dance and eat and didnt need shapewear (im a L, so i often use spanx). I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",

I bought Large being size 12, probably could've sized up for a bit more room but otherwise it was a nice snug fit. Wore a sticky bra and it didn't show through anymore than a bra lining would. No panty lines! And fabric was light and flowy. It did get wrinkly but that was probably my fault.",
