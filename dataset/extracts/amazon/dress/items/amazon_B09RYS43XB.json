This was so lightweight, the slit on the side made it easy to walk. I am 5'7\" I had to be careful not to trip though for it being a bit long, it easily could be hemmed but I bought it last minute and didn't have time. This was a September wedding. The quality of the material is wonderful, it's not itchy at all and that is always a deal breaker for me with material, it will snag easy if your not careful due to the lace overlay but isn't easily seen if that happens. There is some give of stretch in the fabric but not alot. Hope this helps anyone thinking of purchasing.",

I think the darker color distracts from my stomach pudge more than the champagne color. I\u2019m keeping this one even though it\u2019s a smidge short. Id say they all fit. I wear a size 16 dress; some reviews said to size down so I also tried a 14 in a different color. It fit about the same but was stretched a smidge tighter across my stomach.I ordered this particular one in petite. The average length gown drags the floor slightly even with 4 inch heels on, which wouldn\u2019t work for outdoor wedding I\u2019m wearing this to.This one is too short for very high heels (I have on 4 inch heels in the picture) but will be fine with 2 inch heels, and I may have the hem altered to be slightly curved at the split to make the shorter length look intentional. I always have to hems altered.I think the petite fit better through the mid section than the average size. I\u2019m a little short waisted and the ruching landed in a better spot on the petite gown.For reference, I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and about 180 lbs. I wear a 16 dress, XL top, and size 12 pants. Keeping the size 16 petite.",

I am 5'3\" and wear a 4 to a 6 on the bottom, but have the usual hips and belly and I am larger on the top. I didn't think a 10 would work, so I ordered a 10 and 12, both petite. The 10 came right away and the 12 would arrive at the end of August, but in plenty of time for my son's wedding. The 10 petite fit me like it was made for me!! I couldn't believe my luck. I bought silver sparkly shoes with a chunky heel by Nina as the wedding is outside and do not need to hem the dress. I am so excited! The dress is stretchy and comfy. I will probably still do shapewear, but the ruching across the belly helps. I bought the dark navy blue with sparkles. Great dress, comfy fit and I am a happy Mother of the Groom. The dress was on sale, too. I will post a pucture after the wedding. Thank you Alex Evenings!!!",

I\u2019m about 132lbs. 36 bust and 29 waist. Ordered Size 6. This dress hugs your body, has stretch to it, and the puckered waist line hides the little-bit of mature mother belly I have left. It\u2019s super comfortable, has some weight to it showing quality. Good quality back zipper. The sequins are well attached. I walked around in it for awhile and had no problems. May have to be carful if planning to wear a bracelet or watch-may catch the sequins.Champagne colour perfect and also much better than others I have tried. Purchased to wear to my daughters upcoming wedding in July. Overall very pleased. Lots of compliments so far from immediate family!",

But, I had to order it 3 times before I got a dress that I could keep. First one the zipper hardly worked, got stuck repeatedly before it would zip all the way up and zipper was not sewn in properly so the fabric gathered and made a funny bump that could not be flattened. Second dress the hem was not sewn all the way around the bottom. Third dress, the zipper works properly and after inspecting it carefully I have not found any issues with how it was sewn. It is a beautiful dress and I am looking forward to wearing it for my sons wedding, but I would recommend ordering it well in advance of your event in case the dress you receive has similar issues and you need to reorder. Would have given it 5 stars if it had not been for the multiple returns.",
