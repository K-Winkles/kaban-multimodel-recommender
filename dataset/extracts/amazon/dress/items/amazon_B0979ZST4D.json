                "reviewText": "For reference, I'm 5'4\", 150 lbs, curvy hourglass figure. I normally wear an 8 or Medium, but sometimes take 10/large.I took advice of other reviews and sized up to a large. I purchased the charcoal and the black. The fit is great, the dress skims my body nicely. However I find the fabric too thin for my liking. It reminds me of Jersey nightgown material, so for that reason I don't really like to wear it by itself. You can use this dress as a great layering piece though and style it with a jean jacket, Cardigans, or even go more casual with a zip up hoodie.You might find the fabric a bit too clingy without any shapewear underneath. The first time I wore the dress I wore it all by itself. The second time I wore it paired with a jean jacket, a belt, and shapewear underneath. I felt much more confident the second time I wore it. I got these dresses for less than 20 bucks each so is a really good value. But given the quality of the fabric, I wish I had only bought one. Unfortunately I missed the return window.It remains to be seen how well this will wash. But I think it should be washed on cold and hung to dry to avoid shrinkage.UPDATE 7/5/19: Upgrading from 4 starts to 5. This is a very versatile dress and I've been getting a lot of use out of the black one I had wanted to return. It does make an elegant night gown, but I love it with a belt and cardigan or jean jacket. These dresses are thin, which I initially complained about, but it's a great weight for summer. The drape is really nice and it doesn't show any cellulite contour. These were a steal for the price.",

Paired with that, black/silver platform flip flops, silver hoop earrings, I was ready for a nice dinner out and stayed comfy the whole time. Very flattering, very flexible with the size, small was perfect which is my usual size. You can do so much with this dress. Quality is great, cross between jersey and silky. Love this dress!!!",

There's an edgey quality to it and I feel cool wearing it. I washed it and let it hang to dry, it didn't shrink and still looks good. It is a little tiny bit transparent due to the thinness of the Jersey material, but it's a summer dress. It's also a little smaller than I expected. I'm 5'11 and 150lbs. I normally wear a medium. I purchased this dress in medium and I wish I bought a large. The length is fine, it's the lower part/hip area that's a little clingy. I'm keeping it but if you have normal sized hips, you may want to size up unless you want it form fitting. Here's the thing, at 20 bucks, it's a great, comfy, cool weekend dress.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT: If you get/got a smelly one, hang it in direct sunlight for a day or two. It fades a little but at least you can wear it.I bought three of these dresses. The first was the maroon in large. I liked the fabric and how the dress hung, but the arm holes were too big. So I got a navy in medium, which fits perfectly and I love it. Then I ordered a medium blue size medium. It smelled SO bad it's unwearable. It's some kind of chemical smell. I tried washing it (3 times) and soaking it in vinegar overnight, but now it's just hanging in the garage, stinking up the place. Totally useless, unwearable, and a waste of money. Moral of the story: these dresses are comfy and decent for the price - as long as you don't get one of the useless chemical-laden dresses. Loved them but won't buy another now.",

I was hesitant because I didn\u2019t know if I needed a medium or large. I decided on large. They fit PERFECT! I love them! The fabric is thin, but, soft and nice! Perfect for spring/ summer! You can dress them up or down! I\u2019m a 36DDD, 5\u201d3 and 150 pounds. I may order another one in green! Believe the reviews! These are wonderful dresses for $15. Highly recommend! The neckline is nice and the armpit area isn\u2019t too low! Seriously, PERFECT!",

Quality, stretchy jersey fabric that is opaque enough that you will not need a slip.I\u2019m 5\u20192 and 120 lbs. It\u2019s a bit longer than I expected, but because of the side slits and subtle hi-low design, it doesn\u2019t feel too long. Perfect dress for work, date night or running errands. I\u2019ll definitely be buying another!",

                "reviewText": "I Absolutely Love these dresses!!! I have bought 3 of them... black, navy and dark red (burgundy). They fit like a dream. I usually fit an XL to XXL... I'm 5' 8\" and 194 lbs. so I ordered the XXL as not to be tight. They don't wrinkle at all. I've been sick and have had to have naps and when I get up \"no\" wrinkles!, which is Amazing!!! The material is so soft and feels so good to wear... not a hot material... more like a cool material that feels great when it's really warm out. The dresses can be for casual or they look good to dress up and go out at night. The material is also light weight, yet heavy enough to skim the body and not cling to it. I would buy more... but the other colours are not for me. To the company that makes them... please make them in some bright colours like; fuchsia pink... a bright jewel purple... royal blue, turquois blue... a pinky/purple orchid colour... a cranberry pink or even more summer fun colours. I think you would sell a lot! Thank you! As you know Ladies... It's hard to buy clothes online as either they are too big, too small, or the material is terrible or looks terrible. This is the best clothing purchase I have found on Amazon and I would recommend Ladies... buying one to try... and I know you'll be coming back to buy more in different colours! It is also fulfilled by Amazon so returns are free! You can't lose!",
