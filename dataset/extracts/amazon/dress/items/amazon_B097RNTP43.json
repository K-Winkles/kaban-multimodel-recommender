                "reviewText": "Finally! This dress is perfect. Perfectly comfortable, perfectly flattering, perfectly appropriate for almost any occasion - from casual to dressy.I love the soft feel and stretch. The fabric is cool, and yet dense enough to hide panty & bra lines AND it hides bulges and cellulite. THIS IS NOT SEE THROUGH!And it fits! Unlike most Amazon sizes that are smaller Asian sizing, this dress is really a good fit for a plus sized woman. And it is long enough. There is no shrinkage after washing and the gentle, high waisted design is very flattering for a woman with a problem belly. THERE IS NO SAUSAGE VIBE WITH THIS GARMENT. The fit is perfect - not baggy like a tent dress and not tight like a sausage. It is an easy, relaxed with no wrinkles or bunching.The design avoids all the pitfalls that usually crop up in plus-sized garments. The armholes do not gape (showing the bra), the shoulder straps do not show straps, the scoop neckline does not choke - NOR DOES IT SHOW CLEAVAGE. I cool, covered & modest, well-dressed, and fashionable. And since I bought it in 3 different colors and prints, I can tell you that the style and sizing is consistent from garment to garment.I only have one complaint - I wish it were available in more colors. I've purchased every variety available, but would have loved to find it in white, lighter prints, bright colors, jewel-tones, brown, prints, etc.It is sleeveless and needs a simple shrug to make it appropriate for three seasons. And if you are in a warm climate, it would work for all four seasons.Highly, highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This dress is very comfortable and great if your body tends to change a lot. I have gained a lot of weight within the past year and a half so it has been difficult shopping for clothes that fit well. I feel like I could wear this dress if I gain or lose weight. Material is breathable and good for the hot summer months. Depending on the brand, I can fit in small/medium on top and large on bottom. Although, with my size now I have been wearing a lot of my clothes in size \"Large.\" Again, it really depends on the brand, but the dress I have is a \"medium\" and runs slightly big. I'm very bottom heavy (big butt) so this fits me well. It's very flattering. If I lose weight, I probably won't wear it and opt for something more fitted.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5'9\" and normally wear plus size 24-26 (3x in USA), but that size varies depending on the country of origin, and the manufacturer. Some places seem to think plus size is below 20, . .. so, MANY plus size women hesitate to buy clothing online.This is an Amazon Essentials tank maxi dress with elastic around the waist. It is a spandex blend, so the overall fabric is a very soft and flowy stretchy jersey knit that feels like cotton. It fits PERFECTLY! Even the armpit holes are the perfect size. Not too low. Not too high. The dress length is also perfect. It goes down to my ankles. Not dragging on the floor, and I'm not tripping over it. The elastic waist band isn't too tight, nor too loose. It has a scoop neck in front and back and is the right height. 3x is accurate. If I had gone down a size it would have been a bit clingy. If I had gone up a size it would have been baggy at the elastic waistband.I will DEFINATELY order more of these!",

It's not sheer at all and is very comfortable.",

Gathered waist hits just right to skim over my tummy, flattering neckline without too much cleavage, armholes don't show my bra, and the length hits top of my foot so hem won't touch the ground if I wear flat sandals. Can dress up for informal outings or lounge at home! Would be perfect for travel. Fabric is soft flowing jersey, not thick yet not see-through. To be safe, I'll wash in cold and hang to dry to prevent shrinkage. I ordered Dark Grey Heather and Burgundy and will likely get some other colours too! Size was consistent for both colours. Of interest: a long Burgundy cardigan I just bought (also Amazon Essentials) is perfect colour match.",
