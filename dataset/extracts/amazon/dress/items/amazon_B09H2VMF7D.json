                "reviewText": "I got a Large -Red & Black Print. I am 5' Large or 12. 36C. I was very pleased with the heavy weight of this dress. The heavy being not light weight, but weighty quality of the material. Not sheer, it is silky, but not slippery, the cut & shape is beautiful. Got what I wanted! If you have a belly like me, or are apple shaped you will need to size up... if you are large chested size up!!! I forgot there was a button and just pulled it on over my head, the button stayed closed.. The bottom front was weird until I figured out I had to adjust the waist to get the hem to balance in front...You adjust the fit where you tie it., at the waist, adjust by reaching under the flap waist part and find the tie going toward the back on your right and pull on the shorter tie on your left to make it longer. You should end up with a longer tie. Length, if you are 5' the dress is around 2\" below the knee, but not like you are wearing a tea length dress. I really like it and if I wore dresses I would buy 3 of these, but I only need one for a wedding. In my opinion the true wrap dress is one of the best inventions, for women by a woman ever! Because you are not locked into a waist size, it is adjustable!! If I could afford a real Diane Von Furstenberg dress, I wold jump on it!. Thank you Amazon Essentials, I love the \"Try Before You Buy\" I didn't need 7 days after I got it, I needed 7 minutes to put it on & buy it!!!",

It fit perfectly but I did pin the front because it showed my bra. A small may have fit better, but this was still perfect. It never wrinkled the entire night. Some reviews said the button underneath where the belt is came unbuttoned but mine didn\u2019t. The material is perfect. Not too thin and not too thick. It is a very flattering fit. I received a lot of compliments. I plan on ordering one in black. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a XXL and I normally wear between a size 16-18 depending on the item. The dress fits well in the bust but is a little loose everywhere else. I did not size down because I was afraid the next size smaller would be too small. Anyway, the fabric is nice and breathable, but not too thin - very comfortable. It was flattering at my waist with the gathered material, but the button hole that holds the wrap together was too large and a little awkward - has a tendency to slip out - the ties are actually enough to hold the dress together securely, but it would be better if the button closure was replaced with a clasp instead. The price for this dress is great, especially for the quality of the fabric and the classic look. I wasn't sure if I liked the \"sleeves\" - IMO, I think this dress would actually look best on me with a light cardigan or shrug.",

I have lost over 40 pounds and didn\u2019t have anything to wear and this was a last minute buy and I was hoping for the best. Thankfully, this dress met my expectations and beyond! I will admit when I was putting it on, I was quite confused on how the dress actually wrapped but there\u2019s a hole meant to pull the band thru and tie to the other side of the band. The button to keep the band and sides of the dress together are a perfect safety addition so you\u2019re not depending solely only your tying skills. Overall great buy and great price. It fit a little tight in the arms but nothing I didn\u2019t get over. If you\u2019re looking for a dress to hide a little bit of extra you have this is it. Fits like a glove! I love it!",

I didn't like how on the sides/back it shows the imperfections of my body but that could easily be fixed with a good body shaper.

But that wasn\u2019t the dresses fault, lol. I hated returning this, as I looked great from the front. This dress is beautiful, stretchy , heavier quality drapey knit fabric. Looks just like pic and colors are beautiful. Nicely sewn. But what I liked best is it fits and hangs well, which means it was well draped ( the pattern) when it was being designed. I know because I was in the fashion business for years and know patternmaking /draping myself! Fit as expected otherwise. I wear XL and felt it was correct. Don\u2019t hesitate to try this if you have a fairly good waist, it\u2019s sexy and cute. If I ever lose some weight, I\u2019ll definitely reorder it lol.",
