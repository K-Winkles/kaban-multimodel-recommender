                "reviewText": "Wasn't sure what I was going to get based on other reviews but I'm glad I gave this a try. I ordered the hot pink size S and it is generally true to size. I'm 5'6,\" 34D bust, 26\" waist, long torso, and a size 4 for reference. This is an adorable shirt dress with a beautiful sateen cotton look and feel. It's a button down Cotton/Poly blend shirt dress with 2 side pockets and puff sleeves. The dress is a bit wider than expected but not in a wide oversized way. It just has extra room, but drapes well enough to not look like a tent or box while on. The length is jus as depicted, it hits me about 2 inches above the knee. There is also extra room in the puff sleeve band that adds movement to the dress. I may cinch this in a bit, as I prefer a more fitted band. Overall, this is a great addition for the upcoming Spring/Summer with the versatility to take you from the office to an evening out while looking chic and on trend!",

                "reviewText": "I like this dress and I love the color. Unfortunately, it runs smaller than the size chart states. I'm a 48 bust, so ordered an XL, which states the bust is 50. So, at the very least, it should fit, and maybe fit a little loosely. The bust on this is quite snug, uncomfortable and gaps a lot between the buttons, plus the sleeves and back shoulder are too tight to move around. I suggest you order a size larger than the measurements state; unfortunately I couldn't order a size larger in this as this was the largest size they have. Too bad, as I do like this a lot, other than being too small to wear.",

                "reviewText": "Cute! It\u2019s an easy outfit and I\u2019m looking forward to wearing it while bloated. :)This dress was super wrinkled out of the bag. Way more wrinkled than anything I\u2019ve ordered before. I spritzed the dress with water and popped it in the dryer for 15 or 20 minutes. It was almost perfect after the dryer! The fabric is a crisp knit, mostly cotton. The texture and the buttons make it look structured and sharp, even though the shape of the dress is oversized and somewhat casual. This dress will make it easy to feel put together on a warm day.I\u2019m so glad I sized down on this one! My measurements are 35\u201d bust, 28.5 waist, 37\u201d hip, and 40\u201d at the \u201cjuiciest\u201d part. I\u2019m between a size 6 and 8, which puts me between small and medium on this size chart. But the bust measurements were generous, so I sized down. The small is roomy on me, even through the hip and thigh. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and the hem hits me a couple of inches above the knee.I tried it with a belt, but the belt interfered with pockets. So I\u2019ll probably wear this without a belt.",

                "reviewText": "ANRABESS Women's Dress Shirt Short Sleeve in blackThis shirt is the perfect combination of style and comfort, making it a must-have for any wardrobe.First of all, the fit of this shirt is amazing. It has a loose and flowy silhouette that is both flattering and comfortable. The short sleeves are the perfect length, hitting just above the elbow, and the length of the shirt is perfect for tucking in or leaving untucked. The collar adds a touch of sophistication to the overall look.The material of this shirt is fairly nive. It is made of a soft and lightweight fabric that is perfect for the summer months. It is breathable and doesn't cling to the body, making it ideal for hot and humid days. The quality of the fabric is evident and it has held up well after multiple washes.One of my favorite features of this shirt is the pockets. Not only do they add a cute and functional element to the shirt, but they are also deep enough to hold my phone and other small items. This makes it perfect for running errands or going out without having to carry a purse.I also appreciate the button-down design of this shirt. It gives me the option to wear it open as a light jacket or closed for a more put-together look. The buttons are also well-made and have not come loose or fallen off like some other shirts I have owned.Overall, I like this dress, It is a versatile and stylish piece that can be dressed up or down for any occasion. The fit, material, and design are all of quality, making it a great addition to any wardrobe. I will definitely be purchasing more colors in the future!",

In fact, I'm wearing it to lead a book group tonight at my work--I'll pair this with black wool leggings. Perfect!",
