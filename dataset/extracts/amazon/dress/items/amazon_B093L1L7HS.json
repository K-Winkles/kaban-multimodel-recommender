                "reviewText": "I first purchased the stress about one year ago. I found myself wearing it almost daily around the house and sometimes even falling asleep in it. It\u2019s comfortable and cool. For our hot, humid summers up here and North Carolina mountains I also wear it on my visits to Las Vegas where we used to live. It\u2019s perfect for the hot weather there in the summer. Sometimes I have a parent with a very light robe over the top depending on the weather. The best thing is that I have found when I\u2019m in a rush and don\u2019t have a minute to change I can cinch it with a belt, throw on hat and a pair of sandals and a straw hat, and it\u2019s a fabulous dress for the day. I have gotten a number of compliments on wearing it both as a day dress as well as a sleep or house dress.I currently have it in olive, black, brown, and rose so I am quite a believer in the quality of the stress. I have also purchase this dress for both my daughters and daughter-in-law as a gift.Don\u2019t think twice go ahead and order the stress if you like a more float comfortable feel it doesn\u2019t hurt to go up a size because the straps are adjustable. The pockets are an extra benefit I am 5 foot four and 165 pounds is stress hits the ground but I like my chassis to be long I have plenty of room and comfort in a size large. I have tried a size medium, but because of my bust size of 36 DD it was just a little bit higher than what I would likeThis dress washes well and dries well no shrinking.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5\"9 and this dress actually goes to my ankles but i don't think I'd wear it out. It's not a flattering dress. If you want a comfy house dress or a bathing suit cover then this is good dress for you. It is comfortable and fits taller girls. Love the pockets. The material is nice, especially if you have animals. Most of my maxi dresses get covered in fur but this one doesn't .I originally ordered a 2X because of my height but it was extremely big, felt more like 3X. I. Ended up exchanging for the 1X and it fit pretty well. I ordered 5 in different colors the dark blue (spaghetti strap) is the same material and is a very nice dress. The blue that fades into a baby blue is NOT the same material it's very thin cotton material, it also doesn't have the same fit as other dresses. It was a lot shorter and not as comfortable as the other dressed. I got yellow (usually don't wear yellow) as well because it was on sale for 11.99 it fits perfect, just like the dark blue. The blue faded to baby blue was the most expensive dress of the 5 and it probably my least favorite. I noticed the price hike. No way I'd pay $33 for these dresses. Too many other dresses in that price range that are nicer & more versatile.",

                "reviewText": "There's 2 listed here, one was a XXL which was the \"suggested size\" for me, however it was HUGE on me! So I had to return and exchange for the XL which was perfect. I am 5' 10\" tall and 160 pounds, I am small boned, so I am tall and not overweight when you see me, being nearly 6 ft, and big brested I don't \"look\" over weight at all, and people can't believe I weigh that much. Long legs and arms, I guess, I don't know. My husband is 6' 4\" and I have longer legs than him! LOL This dress in the XL is long enough which is shocking! Normally everything \"long\" is too short on me. It IS a bit loose, but I can't stand dresses SO tight it makes you look like a stuffed sausage! It's a horrible look, to me anyway. It's just a much more flattering look when a dress is slightly loose, so it flows over a woman's body, as my hubby says, it's much more sexy looking to a man! And I Normally agree with him on things, probably why we've been together for nearly 50 years! This dress is SO COMFY! I will probably get a couple more colors! I wear it with a cute long silky duster.",
