I feel like maybe a 1/2 size smaller would have worked, so if you\u2019re on the border between sizes, you may want to go down. The sheer with hearts is so pretty, the button clasp on the back is easy to use, and there is a small hidden side zipper for easy closing. The length is nicely above the knee and the fabric has some stretch. Highly recommended.",

I ordered a large, which fit perfectly overall except the top does have a bit of room, and I\u2019m a 36 DD so normally stuff is a bit more snug up top. It comes right above my knees, which is perfect as I got this for Christmas. Not tight/super dork fitting on the bottom which gives a beautiful lift when you twirl. The baby blue is stunning, especially with my lighter skin and eyes with dark hair. The only thing I don\u2019t care for is the zipper which is located under the armpit on the right side. I could\u2019ve done without it, as it is a bit annoying. But overall, this dress is a 5 out of 5. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",
