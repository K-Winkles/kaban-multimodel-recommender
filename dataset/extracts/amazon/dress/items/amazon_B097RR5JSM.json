The cost, I feel, is reasonable and without a strain on the wallet. The material wasn't quite what I expected, but, it is nice and I do like it. I also like how the dress moves with me. I only wear it around the house and in the garden, but it'll be cuter with a nice wide brim sunhat to go with it. Buy it, if you want something comfortable and cost effective. It's worth the investment. Good product.",

It's true to size and flowy after the first wash, kinda clingy when first trying it on. Thinner material so expect some easy wear and tear but I don't regret this purchase at all. Its super comfy, stretchy, longer and light weight, perfect for southern winter.",
