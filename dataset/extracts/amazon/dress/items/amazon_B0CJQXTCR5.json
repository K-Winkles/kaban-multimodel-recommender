I want a different color because the style is perfect and actually fits me the way I want it to. I'm 5'4\", so a lot of times, maxi dresses are too long for me, but this one is doable, and I'm really excited about it! If it was any longer, I don't think I could safely get away with it. The price is good for the quality - I'd order another one in a heartbeat. Another great thing - must have, actually, are POCKETS! It washed well, and I tumble-dried it for just 2 minutes with a fabric softener sheet on low heat and hung it to dry the rest of the way. It dried very quickly! The material will be cool, especially in a coastal breeze! :) Nice and flowy - the ruffle is pretty when you walk!",

I think this dress would look cute dressed down with sneakers or dressed up with a sandal or heel. One of the best parts\u2026. POCKETS! She has pockets! And the brown color is cute! I feel brown will go with all skin tones, as you can see in my pictures I am pretty fair skinned. I cannot wait for summer to come around so I can wear this out and about!",

I mainly got this for the color, as it is my favorite; the color and size is true to the advertisement. As you can see, the stitching in the bust area is done well and on the seams there is none of the construction one sometimes see with straggling threads and/or seams not lining up. FYI, the top of the bust needs a quick iron or stream to lay the ruffle, but that's just from packaging and shipping. It isn't a big deal to me.The second picture I just quickly put a hair tie in the inside of the dress to play with its versatility, so thought I'd include that for those who like to get creative. Overall, the dress is great!For reference, I am 6'0.",

It cinches underneath the breast/chest area which helps to enhance a slim look silhouette. The bottom part of the dress is flowing super flattering as well. I am always reluctant to buy super flowy dresses because sometimes it has a sack like appearance, this one does not do that. This dress is screaming summer for me and I can wait to rock it in the summer or on vacation in warmer climate this winter. Oh and an added bonus it has pockets that are hidden at the waist!",
