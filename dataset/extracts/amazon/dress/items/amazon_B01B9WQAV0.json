                "reviewText": "I had to switch from a tea-length version of this dress to the long version at the last minute before my son\u2019s wedding. It arrived 10 days before the wedding, which was great! However, it was too long, as I figured it might be, and had someone hem it for me. The length of the overlay and the actual dress shell was all over the place (VERY uneven). Luckily for me, the shortest part of the hem was exactly where I needed the length to be, so my great seamstress saved the day! It turned out well, but just be aware that these mass produced dresses aren\u2019t perfect in the quality control department!",

                "reviewText": "This is the 4th dress I've ordered on Amazon for my grandaughters wedding, thanks to makers not having consistent sizing. This one, finally, fits!! I'm 5'6 136 lbs fairly large bust and a little extra weight around tummy. I originally bought 2 other dresses in size 10 - my size - and too tight in chest/waist. So I picked this dress in a 12 and it was tooo big overall. Finally, this in size 10 is my keeper. All others are going back.The color is medium dusty blue, nice quality fabric, and has an overall elegant quality look. This is a nice modest and understated but dressy dress, and comfortable, which is what I wanted. No real wow here but good for granny of bride.I did have to hem. I'll update with pics after wedding.",

                "reviewText": "I intended to wear this Alex Evenings dress for my son's wedding. The first time I tried it on, the invisible zipper wouldn't work without jamming. I was able to get it loose, but I started to get skeptical about relying on it for such an important occasion. The second time I put the dress on was to model it for my daughter. She carefully worked the zipper this time and it still jammed every few inches. Finally we gave up on it in fear it would break, and I managed to sliver out of the dress with the zipper jammed part way down.I had to find a different dress! This is a $200 dress and I couldn't take the chance! Needless to say, this is disappointing quality and workmanship for such an expensive product. I would just as soon have a regular zipper than an invisible one that doesn't work.Everything was fine about the dress otherwise: it fit well, material is pretty. But none of that matters if you can't get in and out!",
