                "reviewText": "I need one in every color! Background on me. I am 5\u20194\u201d, hourglass figure, a fit 136 lbs, 35\u201d bust, 26\u201d waist, 38\u201d hips. I ordered a small and fits perfectly. Not too tight or too loose. I would recommend this dress in every color as a basic. It does need at least a slim belt and unique shoes to break it up and looks so polished with just a few touches. Also, this dress is well priced but I would recommend it regardless of price.One thing to be aware of. The different colors come in different fabrics. The first dress I got was the dark navy and it is a perfect mix cotton, nylon and spandex. The dress is not lined but the fabric is thick enough to not see body imperfections and undergarment lines and stretches where you need it (bust, hips). Then I needed a pink one for the Barbie movie (got deep rose) and the peacock one to pair with some new Freebird shoes I got that are a unique color. Those two colors came in the polyester fabric. I was surprised when I opened the package. It\u2019s buried vaguely in the description if you change your color choice and the scroll down to read about the fabric for each one. The fit is still good but I like that polyester fabric less as it shows more line and imperfections. For the basic colors (black, red, white, Navy, grey, light pink, etc) they all come in the nice cotton blend. I\u2019m going to buy every last one. I dress up a lot and like to have options. Different belts, different jackets, different shoes all make them look different. The dress hits right above my knees. I didn\u2019t buy any of the pattern dresses, but they are made of just cotton according to the description. I don\u2019t care for the polyester ones and won\u2019t be buying more of those colors.",

I likely would try a smaller size if I were to get one again, just to see if it complements my figure better. The dress doesn\u2019t have \u201clining\u201d and the fabric is inexpensive as was expected, and is white on the inside. I don\u2019t have a problem with this and think the shape is mostly universally flattering based on my body shape growing up. I\u2019ll def wear this more than once and don\u2019t regret the purchase, it\u2019s just not the most comfortable in comparison to other fabrics, but is certainly comfortable enough to wear all day with heels as a teacher.I used to be 170 lbs heavier and held a lot of weight in my stomach and so the rest is for my ladies with curves. I was big my whole life until about 2018 and believe this would still look nice on a different designed woman, and, if you have curves, you very well know that once you get an item in whether it would shape well on your figure and that time is not so far past that I would forget what shapes I needed at the time for my body.",

According to the chart, I should have ordered the XL but I went to the reviews and after reading a few decided to order the Large. Perfect fit! When a dress has spandex or elastane even though my bust will usually steer me to the XL I look better in the L, Spandex is a lifesaver! This particular dress is very nicely done. It has a zipper in the back, is beautifully designed. The collar and chest/neck area has a unique and classic design that gives this dress some serious style. I am thrilled that I took the opportunity and purchased it. I am thinking of trying a few more colors. Awesome dress for the price!",

It\u2019s super comfy and stretchy, the only reason I didn\u2019t give 5 stars was because the top of the dress was a little too big. I don\u2019t have the biggest chest but the rest is great! Don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll hold up in the wash but so far so great! I\u2019d definitely try another print and maybe try going down a size to see if I like it better!",
