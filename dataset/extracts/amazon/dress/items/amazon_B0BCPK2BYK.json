                "reviewText": "As with another dress I tried from Anrabess, I feel like what i received is a similar dress to the one in the photo, but not exactly the same. I'm 5ft 2 and the dress length hits at weird spot on my shins, not at all flattering. The dress itself is thick stretchy fabric, but it is not drapey, so it doesn't hug curves, it just kind of hangs there like this oddly long and thick loin cloth. The sash is way too thick and any way I try to tie it it just creates bulk in the midsection. Colour was a bright tomato red , I expected it to be darker based on the photo. Overall I'm very disappointed by this product.",
