It is a very nice material that is not sheer/see-through at all. Comfy sleeves at a modest length, and the midi skirt length fell at my mid-calf. It is a very comfortable material that is breathable and was perfect on a hot summer day. And it has pockets! They are large enough to fit a cellphone. Highly recommend - although I would probably have gone for a Medium to have a more fitted shape. Kept it anyway, as I really think it will be a nice dress to use for work.",

It fits perfectly, and now that the weather has gotten colder, I simply pair it with colorful tights and a cardigan. I bought it in black. It is a true black, so pairing it is easy. It is not heavy, so it was comfortable this fall to wear with sandals.",

It achieves its goal of being easy, simple, and comfortable. But does so with a vibrant pop of color (not quite bubblegum pink-but close) and solid quality material. It\u2019s a casual dress you can throw on for work, church, etc.It fits well. The waist cinches with a tie allowing for a more flattering fit. The sleeves are cuffed but fit comfortably.The length is a tad long for a midi but I am only 5\u20193\u201d (wearing an XS).The fabric is not sheer at all\u2014something I often worry about with this shade of pink. Durable, quality fabric while still being light.",

Love the pockets and functional buttons. I got these mostly because of the buttons, so I could nurse while wearing them. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and the L hits mid-calf. I was tempted to size up to XL because sometimes the bust is tight, but the Large is perfect. Hopefully they hold up through the wash! I bough the black, green flowers, white confetti and they are all super cute! White does need a slip but I found one that\u2019s a tiny bit shorter than the last button on the dress.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5'3\", 120 lbs. The size Small fits perfectly. This dress is very well made. The fabric feels wonderful. It is slightly see through, I may decide to wear a slip, but could be ok without. The sleeves are long enough. The pockets are decent sized. My only negative is that the waist drawstring is about one inch above my natural waistline, and I am short! I would love to find this dress with long sleeves and in a petite size so that it would be knee length instead of mid calf. I will point out that it has a 'shirttail hem', so that it is slightly longer in back than in front. That wasn't obvious to me in the picture, but not a big deal, either. I think this is a great bargain, just wish for more colors and options.",

                "reviewText": "I love this dress despite the poofy sleeves. I am 5'2, very busty, and normally a size 12. I got this in XL and it fit perfectly to be slightly fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom. I washed in cold and hung to dry and it did not shrink. The downfall of this dress is the ridiculous puffy sleeves. Maybe they are more flattering on a tall person but they hit me at an unflattering length and looked so matronly and poofy. I had the sleeves shortened 2 inches and the band on the sleeves removed. Now the dress is perfect. It is a bit long on me but not a big deal. The dress is so versatile! I ended up ordering another color and had the sleeves fixed on it, too.",
