Length of dress was just above the knees which made this wearable & appropriate for any occasion. I ordered a 2XL and it was too big so I will be exchanging for a size down.",

                "reviewText": "For what this dress is, it's pretty good. It's not a high-quality designer piece, but if you're not too picky, you could wear it for a night out and look very nice. It's mostly polyester, but it has an unusual weave and feel to it like the material was meant to be used for Halloween costumes. The sequin overlay portion is impressive as are the cut and design of the dress--take a look at all of the reviews with photos if you're not convinced. It's won't necessarily give you the most polished look you've ever seen, and I'm not sure how it would stand up to multiple uses, but the price point it sells at makes that forgiveable. I'm 5'9\" and 180 lb. with a pear-shaped figure, usually somewhere between a size 12 and 14, and the large fit me quite well when worn with a bra that gives good lift. Ultimately, I ended up not wearing this dress out and changed my clothes at the last minute. I'm more old-fashioned and prefer garments that are well designed, very sturdy and structured, and of a bit higher quality than this dress, so if you're like me, this isn't likely to be your favorite thing in the closet.",

Until I stumbled upon this dress. They had so many beautiful colors to select from it was hard to decide! But as you can see, I selected the Royal Blue. It fits perfectly and I was complemented by all my colleagues at the party. I plan on wearing this dress to my 23rd Wedding Anniversary dinner that my husband has planned for us on New Years. It's so comfortable, simple with a hint of elegance. I would certainly buy this brand of dress again. Just in a Emerald Green or Red next time! LOVE IT!",

The cuffs on the sleeves are snug enough to keep them from falling too long on my arms. I am 5\u20193\u201d, 140# and ordered a size 10. Because I am short in the torso, the crossover too was too loose. I sew, so I was able to unpick the top shoulder hem and take up 2\u201d at each shoulder seam. I gathered the shoulder cap so it would fit the armscye and it looked great.",
