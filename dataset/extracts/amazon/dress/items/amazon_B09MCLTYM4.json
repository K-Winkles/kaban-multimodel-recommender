                "reviewText": "This was recommended in a travel fashion group and I can see why. I'm 5'4\", 140, and the L fit great. An M might have worked but been snugger than I like. The sleeves are a great length, covering up that \"Oh yeah, I'm 65\" area. The length hit a couple of inches below my knees and with the skirt movement, was very flattering. On me, (36C) the neckline was fine, no gaping, not too revealing, I didn't feel the need to close it up any more. The waistband hit very close to my natural waist, as I'm short-waisted, so it had more of a shirtwaist than an empire waist effect, which is exactly what I wanted. The fabric is very soft, almost like a t-shirt but with more body. Out of the very small package I was able to shake out any wrinkles so it will be a great dress to pack. The pockets are awesome and don't interfere with the way the skirt flows-no funny sticking out at the hips. Not sure what carrying a phone etc. would do to the lines but it feels very forgiving. No lumps or lines very visible from front or back even with the light color. The design is very pretty and a nice change from tiny prints on dark background, but not too much--reminds me a bit of an expensive scarf design. It looks and feels so lovely I already ordered it in solid black as it seems like it would be the perfect travel LBD. Note that the size chart with inches may be misleading--I went by the \"L=12-14\" and it was accurate. The inches chart would have put me in an XL which would have been too big--individual shape may throw that off. Shipping was very fast and the seller's tracking etc. was great.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 50 yo, size 14/16 tomboy who feels awkward in dresses. COVID weight added to my arms and mid section. Nothing looks right on this body anymore! I have a Celebration of Life service to attend and I needed a cheerful outfit to wear that flattered my new figure and honored the deceased. I bought the XL size (also bought the XXL, but it hasn't arrived yet, so I'm only reviewing the XL for now). I was expecting to not like the way the dress hung on my torso. But I was surprised to find that it flattered my good areas (waist, butt, chest, legs) and hid or at least didn't highlight the bad areas (stomach pot, hips, etc). The fabric weight is perfect for summer weather. It hangs nicely. It is soft and stretchy too. The colors and pattern are beautiful. Plus it looks great with pockets! I will need to add a little extra breast boost to my bra to compensate for my lower half looking more pear shaped. Not the dress's fault. More to mine equal out the small chest and large hips. I also intend to wear this dress to a garden party this summer.If I were to be critical of anything, the XL feels a little short between the bottom of my bra and where the pleats are stitched. I want to keep tugging it down a bit. But that could just be me not used to the freedom of nothing clinging to my abdomen. It hides my stomach rolls (hate to admit I have them, but hey, I'm writing this review to help others make a decision about their size choices) very well when I'm standing or sitting. I know I have work to do to lose weight and feel better about my appearance, but while I'm doing that work, I can still feel good about looking good in this dress.I'm 5'11, 196lbs, long torso, broad shoulders, small chested (38c), and 44 hips. Hope this helps you with your size decisions.",

                "reviewText": "I loved the dress so much I ordered 2 more in different colors! I love the fit of the dress and the length is long enough that I can wear it day or night! I like how it is not super long to the floor. The material is thin though, so I definitely recommend a jacket if it is a cool night when you wear it and in very bright light I could see it was slightly \"see-through\". I wore this dress all day and it never got uncomfortable and wasn't a pull and tug situation. For the money, I would say it is a great buy. And I machine wash mine on delicate and I do not machine dry just because I don't want it to shrink. It's easily hand washable and seems ok for the drier if you put it on a low setting. Love it!!",

                "reviewText": "I've gotten several versions of this dress and like each one. I'm 5'9'' and about 190 lbs and the large works well. They're very stretchy, a great length if you're taller, and have nice deep pockets. They also work well if you have a larger bust but they're pretty low cut. For extra modesty, use a safety pin or wear a bandeau/camisole underneath. The fabric is a little thin so I'd say the patterned dresses are a little more flattering if you're curvier and have bulging in the back. I agree with other reviewers that the color fades a bit in the wash so I don't think they're great for more formal occasions, but they're perfect if you want an easy dress to throw on in more casual settings.",
