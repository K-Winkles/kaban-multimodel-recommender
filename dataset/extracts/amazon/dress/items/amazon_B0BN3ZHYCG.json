I am wearing this in the Bahamas with a small wedge heel, gold necklace and simple gold studs. The dress has just enough detail for an eye catching response, you really don\u2019t need much more. The open back is super sexy and beautiful. The quality is solid, very comfortable and the price is on point. New staple dress in my capsule wardrobe for 2024 summer and vacation.",

                "reviewText": "The quality and value is unbeatable! This dress fits really well and is very flattering and sexy. The material is great and it looks more expensive than costs. I love that this dress can be dressed up or down and worn on many different occasions and to many different events. Weddings, cocktail events, city dinners, sophisticated brunches, also as resortwear on vacation etc. it is closet staple of mine now :) I can\u2019t reccomend it enough! Btw I am 135lbs 5ft9.5inches and I\u2019m pretty sure I ordered a medium to be safe (I think I could have gone down a size and I would have been fine) there is enough stretch but not too much. Also this doesn\u2019t really wrinkle which I love; it travels well: can be rolled up, and not wrinkle (bc of material and color) I will probably get it in a couple more colors! If it helps you (bc it helps me when purchasing): my measurements are currently as follows: breast 35 (34.75) waist 28 (27.75) hips 38 (38.5). These photos are only from a few weeks ago! Hope this all helps!",

I dressed it up with jewelry for a wedding and I liked it and felt comfortable in it the whole night. It was also worn to a summer wedding so it was nice that this is a bit of a lighter material and not hot. I like that I feel like I'll be able to wear this wedding guest dress again at not wedding-related events as well, which definitely isn't the case for all wedding guest dresses.",
