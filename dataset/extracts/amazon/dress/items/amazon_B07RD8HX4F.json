I am 5\u2019, 120lbs. 36\u201d hips and 34\u201dchest. Small is perfect. It\u2019s fairly thin so a coat could be added for extra warmth if needed and I could also wear an undershirt if needed. It has stretch to it and is a cool feeling not hot and fuzzy. I like the tight wrists and how the good doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s pulling on my neck. I haven\u2019t washed it yet but I think it will do fine in cold water and I may line dry it before I attempt the dryer just because I don\u2019t want to risk shrinking it. Cute fun cozy piece for running errands, doing chores, or just lounging or driving teenagers around, iykyk!",

                "reviewText": "I've recently found myself gravitating towards dresses and tunics paired with leggings or jeans, and this particular piece has become a staple in my fall/winter wardrobe. This is an absolute must-have for anyone looking for comfort and versatility in their clothing choices.The comfort level of this dress is unparalleled, making it a go-to option for those days when you want to feel cozy and relaxed. What's more, it's incredibly adaptable, allowing you to easily dress it down for a casual look or dress it up with the right shoes and accessories for a more polished ensemble.The quality of the fabric and construction is impressive, exuding durability and ensuring it can withstand regular wear throughout the colder months. However, it's important to note that this dress does tend to run large. I'm 5'4 and 140lbs, and even though I ordered a medium, it was still quite roomy on me. For those with a similar build, opting for a small might provide a more tailored fit.One small quirk to mention is that the hood seems to be excessively large for some reason. While this might not be a deal-breaker for everyone, it's worth considering if you prefer a more proportionate hood size.Despite the sizing issue and the oversized hood, I would undoubtedly purchase this dress again, perhaps in multiple colors, given its comfort, quality, and overall appeal. It's a versatile piece that effortlessly combines style and comfort, making it a great addition to any wardrobe",

                "reviewText": "das Material gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut. Nicht zu d\u00fcnn und vor allem nicht zu dick. Es ist kein Outdoor-Hoodie.Der Schnitt ist wie bei den meisten Kleidungsst\u00fccken dieser Art nicht wirklich vorteilhaft, das sollte aber allgemein bekannt sein. Es ist vielmehr ein gem\u00fctliches Teil einfach nur zum ruml\u00fcmmeln. Und genau daf\u00fcr habe ich es gekauft.Ich bin ca. 1,60m gro\u00df und trage die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe 50/52. Oft kaufe ich aber Gr. 54, weil die Hersteller meist die \u00c4rmelweite nicht ausreichend an die Gr\u00f6\u00dfen anpassen. Urspr\u00fcnglich wollte ich deshalb das Shirt in 4X bestellen. In vielen Rezensionen wird eine Nummer kleiner empfohlen, weil das Shirt recht gro\u00df ausf\u00e4llt. Also habe ich nur 3X bestellt, 2X h\u00e4tte aber auch gereicht.Es ist tats\u00e4chlich sehr weit und bei mir kniebedeckend. Auch die \u00c4rmelweite ist super. Da kneift und schn\u00fcrt nichts.Ich hoffe, dass meine Begeisterung auch nach dem Waschen anh\u00e4lt.",
