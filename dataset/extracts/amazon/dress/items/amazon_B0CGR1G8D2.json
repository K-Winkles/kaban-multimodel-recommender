It fits a little snug, so be warned. But, the material is almost \"compression garment\" like, so it really slims you down and is extremely flattering. Slim arms and waist effect, but bells out at the hips to create a really great shape. Im 5'5\" and it wasn't too short, and the slit wasn't too high.",

I would definitely size up if you have a larger chest, as that is where there is the least amount of give - it squished me down a bit in the chest and I am only like a 34c. It has great compression through the waist and arms and I like the slight flare in the skirt. It is a little shorter than I expected and I had to pull it down a few times, but still appropriate to wear.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the QINSEN Women's Sweetheart Neckline Long Sleeve Dress Side Slit Stretch Flare Mini Dress, and overall, I am quite pleased with the quality and design of the dress. The material is excellent, and it feels comfortable and stretchy, allowing for easy movement.The sweetheart neckline adds a feminine and flattering touch to the dress, and the long sleeves make it suitable for cooler weather. The side slit adds a bit of flair and adds a playful element to the overall design.However, I have decided to return the dress for a specific reason. After breastfeeding, I feel more comfortable wearing a padded bra for added support. Unfortunately, the neckline of this dress is not compatible with the bras I currently own. The bra straps would show, which is not the look I was going for.While this is a personal preference and may not be an issue for everyone, I wanted to mention it in my review. The dress itself is lovely, and if you don't mind showing your bra straps or have a different type of bra that works with the neckline, it could be a great addition to your wardrobe.I would still give this dress a four-star rating because the material and overall design are excellent. It's just unfortunate that it didn't work out for me personally due to my specific bra requirements.",

New mommy and the sag after breast feeding but a good supportive bra would fix that. I don\u2019t suspect it would have shrunk after a wash but I did not wash it, I returned it.",

Slight unpleasant smell, will wash first. Material is thick & not see through. Construction and quality pretty good for the price. Happy I bought.",

The material is thick and buttery smooth, but I \u2019m 5\u20199 and I had to be VERY careful about bending over/sitting due to how short it is because it BARELY covered my but. The pictures make it look a bit longer than it really is. So be aware of that before ordering. Other than that it\u2019s super cute.",
