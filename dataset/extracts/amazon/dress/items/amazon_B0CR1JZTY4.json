Usually, I run between a small and a medium. I erred on the side of roomy. My thought had been to wear this without a bra. I might have been able to do that if I had ordered the small. No way with the medium.This medium is very generous in its cut. Very roomy and flowy, even with the side zipper. The design allows for room in the hips.Gorgeous feminine dress. Depending upon how you prefer to wear your dresses, might want to consider sizing down.",

The color is bright and lovely - and it's fully lined down to the knee, so no worries about it being see-through.The fabric is very light and airy. I do agree that it's a plenty roomy dress, and I could have potentially sized down, but as the back is ruched elastic, it's fine. The neckline/straps are really interesting and different from other dresses I had seen, however they do necessitate the wearing of a strapless bra, but that's fine - I was expecting to need something of the sort!",
