I feel like the top didn\u2019t blouse at all like it does in the picture. And when I tried to pull it up to blouse the back didn\u2019t look right. I feel as if this is more for a petite size person or someone with a shorter torso. The length was above the knee which I love. The fabric is a lightweight thin sweater knit. To me it\u2019s opaque even though it\u2019s lightweight. I had purchased the brown one. I\u2019m returning it. I\u2019ll try to sew up my own version.",
