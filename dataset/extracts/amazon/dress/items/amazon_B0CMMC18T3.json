                "reviewText": "The Summer dress is really cute but it runs really small. I normally wear a L or XL in a dress, so I ordered the XL so it would be roomy. I was able to pull the dress on but it was really tight under the boob and made my stomach look really large and not flattering. The dress was also restricting in the arms as when i went to pull it off i couldn't get my elbows under the elastic waist and was worried and then just proceeded to quickly pull straight up to get it off. If the elastic in the waist were more stretchy it would be easier to get on and off. The dress is lined and the fabric feels like cotton. It is really nice, I would maybe order two sizes up for comfort if you are size 14 and up, as this may be a junior sized dress. The skirt part is really cool though, So I am tempted to cut the top off and have a nice skirt.",

It feels lightweight and breathable. Definitely deserves 5 stars.",

It's rather tight on me and I don't think it's terribly flattering (because it's so tight). I did have that moment of panic taking it off where I though I might get stuck in the dress, but I got it off. If I had gotten a size larger, I'd definitely keep and wear the dress. It's lined, except for the bottom six inches. It's a cute style and the neckline is such that I think you could wear it off the shoulder if you so choose. The material is a nice breezy cotton and it went just below my knees.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5 ft 5 and 235 lbs with a slightly smaller bust than one would expect on a woman my size. I normally wear a 2XL or an 18-20.I was just in the size range for the 2XL, so that is what I ordered. It fits, but just barely. If I gain any weight it will be too tight in the bust for sure, and maybe in the stomach/butt too. Luckily I prefer my clothing to be tighter, so it's actually perfect for me.This dress is mostly cotton so it doesn't stretch at all (aside from the elastic waistband). The fabric is a comfortable cotton feel, and I love the eyelets. The color is great, too. Though I am worried about it potentially staining anything in the wash, so I'll probably wash it alone for a while.One thing I really love about the dress is that even though it has a square neckline, I don't have the problem I so often do of the shoulders falling down off of one or both shoulders. They stay up and are secure.Grace Karin is a good brand that I've come to trust.",
