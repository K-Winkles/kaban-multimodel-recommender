                "reviewText": "This dress in size small fits me perfectly. I'm 5'6\" and 114 lb, and normally wear size 4. The dress hangs and swings beautifully -- as it should. My pictures really don't capture how nice it is -- especially when you are moving, but at least they show a real person.I love that the material extends all the way to the shoulders so that the bra straps are covered. Also, the arm holes neither cut in nor are too wide on me. The material is soft, light and cool, and that is also its only fault. The band around the arms isn't stiff enough; it rolls slightly at the base and won't lie flat after a few hours of wear. While I wouldn't wear this to a fancy restaurant on its own, it's perfect to throw on for a summer day or a casual restaurant. I just went on vacation and wore it constantly. I'm going to buy two more while I can.If worn in the proper size (with a nice, loose drape, but not oversized), I think this could look nice on most women. As a swing dress, it is forgiving and hides a little tummy if you know what I mean. It should not be worn snuggly. Honestly, It may not be the best choice for larger or very curvy ladies, who may find it difficult to get the same \"swing\" effect without getting too large a size, which would leave the arm holes too wide.",

Often it looks like mid calf, but their model must be 5\u201910\u201d, because it barely covers my knees. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d. The only bad thing is that it doesn\u2019t come of the dryer without wrinkles. My husband dried it though, and didn\u2019t take it out right away, so I can\u2019t say if it would be that way if taken out right away. Definitely worth the money, which isn\u2019t bad.So I hung it up and by the next morning, all the wrinkles were gone! Makes this dress perfect for me!",

The fabric is extremely soft and flowy, but on the thin side, so while it wasn\u2019t see through at all, it did show undergarment lines. I think I prefer the Daily Ritual \u201ccozy knit\u201d dresses which are a little thicker and heavier. The arms were a bit wider than I would have liked (think muscle shirt) which just made my arms look big. I did appreciate that my bra didn\u2019t show under my arms, though. The green color was beautiful, the dress was true to size, and the length was perfect, just above my knees (I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d). If you can buy it with free returns, you might give it a try. I think on a lot of people this would look super cute.",
