                "reviewText": "I'm pretty short (5'2\") so I always expect dresses to be longer than the model photo. This was longer on me, but it hits in a flattering place. Because it wears longer on me, it looks more like a dress than just wearing a t shirt with no pants. I like the relaxed pj style fit because it means there aren't any constricting seams or anything like that. In the summer I wear this style as is but in the fall/winter it's really easy to just add a longer cardigan and leggings to keep warm. The shade of green is my favorite...kind of mossy, a little acid green. It's very pretty and earthy. I didn't have an issue with shrinking but I only wash with cold water and dry until damp.",
