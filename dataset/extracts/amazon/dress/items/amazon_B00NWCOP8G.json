                "reviewText": "Oh, this is a gorgeous gown! It's difficult to describe the exact color, but I'll do my best -- it's an unusual shade for formal wear. I don't expect to \"see myself\" in multiple iterations at the big event I am planning to attend. The gown is just that \"different.\" The lining is a medium steel gray and the net overlay is an ashy-gray/brown (with more emphasis on the brown) -- the result is a mutable shade of taupe in some lights, and a slightly bronzy-gray in others -- but the over-all result is simply lovely. The beaded embellishments are perfect for it -- more concentrated on the bodice and around the neckline, but gradually tapering off down the skirt. The godets in the skirt move gracefully and the fit is spot-on for size. It's a very flattering design and the color is, I think, an attractive choice for many women. The skirt is long, however -- I am 5'7\" and even with heels on, I needed to have the skirt professionally shortened by over two inches. That added an extra $60 to the cost of the gown. A final point: I was concerned about finding shoes that would go well with this gown -- silver wasn't right, and black looked too harsh -- but I found a perfect match in Adrienne Vittadini's Surya Dress pump in a pewter-gray (also on Amazon).",

The dress is lovely but no where in the description does it say that the top has soft padded bra cups built in (like a swimsuit). As a busty girl, this is a negative and it was too tight on top. Also, it is very long. At 5'8\" in heels, it was still dragging on the ground.",

Wonderful compliments from everyone and it was a very flattering dress as mother of the bride. As mother of the bride, you deserve to wear a stunning dress like this. Not too heavy even with all the beading. Just flowed so elegantly. Beautiful in pictures and went well with the entire wedding party. Highly recommend this dress and because it is a somewhat stretchy material it conforms to just make for a wonderful fit. I am a size 12 - 14 and easily fit in 12. Quite long. I am 5'5\" and cut about 2 1/2 \" off and still able to wear 3 1/2 inch heals. Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "This product was ordered as one of four dresses to be tried on. I expected to send 3 back and keep one. All the dresses had to go back because none of them fit as expected. This is a very large dress and does not fit according to the size on the label. It has taken weeks to get a person on the phone and it is still not processed. When I spoke with them, Amazon has confirmed they have the dress that was returned and also have the money. They said I would have to wait 6 weeks for a refund. I was told that this was a new August 2023 policy for returns with Amazon. For an item this costly, this is unfortunate and unacceptable.",
