It's like wrapping yourself in a cloud of softness and stretchiness. The length hits just right, falling mid-thigh even with a little extra booty bump action going on. And here's the best part \u2013 it's a breeze to care for. Hand wash or toss it in the machine, a couple of wrinkles magically disappear with wear. Wash and wear? Sign me up!But wait, there's more. This dress has some weight to it, which means no embarrassing Marilyn Monroe moments when a gust of wind decides to make an appearance. Plus, it feels like a dream and looks like a million bucks. Now, back to my friend, she\u2019s a size 16. She tried on my size large, and while it was a tad snug on her, it fit me like it was tailor-made.If you're ready to slip into this pocket paradise and prepare to feel like a goddess every time you wear it. Trust me, once you go pocket, you'll never go back!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this summer dress for my mother and she ended up loving it! I say ended up because when she pulled it out of the bag she was very hesitant about the length of the dress and the ruffles. I told her just to try it on because she's shorter (5'2\") so it may actually fit right...and I was correct. She called me after putting it on and told me it's super cute and she will be keeping it. The ruffles on the sleeves are very flattering and kind of elevate it from just a tshirt type dress to a cuter summer dress. The length hits her right above the knee which is great for summer and her age group. She's excited because she can pair it with her summer hat and it matches very well. She doesn't wear wedges but you could dress it up more with wedges if you wanted. If you're taller this might be short on you but for us shorter gals it fits beautifully.",
