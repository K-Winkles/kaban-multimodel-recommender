Ordered this dress on a whim. It fits perfectly! I feel like it does show off my belly a little bit, but nobody else agrees so maybe it's just a me thing! Dress is great quality, good material, and I feel like it'll be perfect!",

It is great for a date night out, but found it to be a too short for any work happy hour(which is what I bought it for). However, because I love the fit, I will keep it to wear for a night out with the husband and friends.",

                "reviewText": "I like this dress and actually ordered it in two different colors. I ordered both navy and black size medium. The dresses were pretty and were accurately described. I must admit that for my body type I will have to pair with shape wear and and possibly an additional slip. I am 5\u20195\u201d, 135lbs, and a 36C. I have a narrow waist but have thighs that stick out slightly further than my hips. The dress by itself clung to my thighs in an unflattering way. The rest of dress fit amazingly. I will have to try it on again with shape wear, a slip and tights. The size is accurate but if you are a little heavier in the thighs be cautious and aware of possible issues.",

Most of all it\u2019s super stretchy and comfortable. The fabric is very soft so I recommend a Spanx bodysuit to avoid lines and bulges and ensure a smooth look (especially from the back - the ruching in the front is forgiving). I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d & 128 lbs and the Medium was perfect.",

                "reviewText": "The dress looked like the lining was on the outside. It was baggy on the outside and fitted on the inside. No, I didn't have it wrong side out. Zipped up fine, seams were firm and smooth around the drape pleating, but the fabric hung on the lining so that anyone wearing it would appear il-kempt. I try to avoid negative reviews. I'm a small business owner and appreciate how hard a job it is to run a business well and produce a quality product every time. I hope this is a \"one off\" for this business and not their norm.",
