I love the dress, purchased 3 to wear around the house and to run errands. I like a looser fit. Not baggy, just not hugging every curve.... so I ordered 1 size up and it fits great! If I wanted a more snug fit (bodycon) I could've ordered my normal size and been just fine. So it all depends on you. This was a good buy.",
