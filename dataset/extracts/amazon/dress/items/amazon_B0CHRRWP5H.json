What drew me to this dress was the fact it is two-tone, dark green with a black jacket. (I wish Grace Karin offered more two-tone colors to choose from\u2014I\u2019d definitely order other combinations.) The sequins gave it a shimmery style, but it wasn\u2019t flashy because of the dark jacket. It was sheer and cool, which I appreciated because I am always warm, and dancing at the wedding made me even more so. I noticed a few sequins fall off (maybe 4 total) on the floor, but that\u2019s not noticeable on the dress at all. Overall, it is well-sewn and comfortable, and I highly recommend this gorgeous dress.",

I bought the silver because I felt it looked sophisticated but not too over the top. I am very pleased with this dress and jacket.The dress fits beautifully and is filled with small sequins. It actually hides my flaws. I purchased a medium and a large and found the large to be the better fit. I like looser comfortable clothes so my purchases are based on the comfy fit.The jacket is a very light weight sheer material with 3/4 sleeve with matching dress pattern on the end. Very pretty.The only con I see is the jacket color is not the same as the dress. You can actually see it in the pictures if you pinch your phone screen big. It still looks beautiful tho. I also bought a facintor hat that arrives tomorrow. I bought a silver one that is simple and elegant and will add a pretty touch for my son\u2019s wedding. I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this dress for the look and price point.One last thing\u2026I am 5\u201d1 and weigh between 125 and 130. I have the dreaded belly that fluctuates in size from eating habits. I also have small back bulge.This dress hides your little flaws.",
