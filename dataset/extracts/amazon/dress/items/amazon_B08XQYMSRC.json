                "reviewText": "First off, the dress is extremely comfortable and cozy and it fits just right. It\u2019s lined with a fleece-like material that makes it perfect for slightly chilly days/nights. Love the side pockets on the dress too. However, the fleece material is poor quality and it sheds EVERYWHERE after washing it the first time. Even after washing there was little white balls of lint everywhere. It\u2019s pretty annoying and inconvenient to get the lint off.I hope the shedding lessens and stops within the next wash or two. I like the dress but it definitely could be made better.",
