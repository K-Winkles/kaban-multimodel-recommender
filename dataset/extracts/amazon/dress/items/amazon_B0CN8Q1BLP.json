                "reviewText": "i am very pleased with this dress. it looks just like pictured in the product/model photos, although i will say the ruffle looks a little more subtle in-person, at least on my body type. i was in between a M and a L on the size chart and went with a L - it fits well with room to breathe, but i probably could have also fit in a M for a snug fit. the fabric is comfortable and the dress is very flattering. it looks very elegant and is nice for nights out. the designer seems to have done a great job giving the dress enough structure to be shaping, while also allowing for a good amount of stretch.i don't usually look good in silhouettes with asymmetrical features, but i loved the design when i saw this item, so i took a risk. i feel very impressed with the design of the dress and how flattering it was. it is definitely a unique and interesting silhouette but it looks so elegant and natural when it's worn. if you're looking for some more interesting silhouettes to freshen up your wardrobe, i highly recommend giving this one a chance, even if it's a risk for your personal style. i will be keeping an eye on this designer as this is the most pleased i've been with a dress in a while.",

The color is fantastic and the style is very flattering as well as a little forgiving. The dress is sexy without looking trashy and I feel like the cut of it would look great on most. Every time I wear it I get showered with compliments, even after I\u2019ve been wearing it for 8 hours. Not bad at all. If you are considering it, I say go for it.",

                "reviewText": "About Me:5'2\", about 160lb, 34DDI usually wear size M or 10 in dresses.I ordered size M, aquamarine color.This dress fits *mostly* as expected.All in all, I think I like this dress. It is different than anything I have and so it will probably take a few wearings to get completely comfortable in it. But, it really has some good things going for it.The material is soft, but sturdy. It feels like it holds its own. It lays nicely. It has a decent amount of stretch. It forms to your body well without being overly tight. (A little shapewear wouldn't hurt if you've got curves.) It has a semi-formal feel to it. It definitely doesn't feel like a cheap \"dance club\" type of dress.The build of the dress is pretty good. I didn't notice any majorly weird bunches or gaps. The off-shoulder part actually lays appropriately and doesn't constantly ride up. There is an elastic band around the waist. Where that falls on you will depend on your build. Having the cinched waist helps accentuate your curves.If there was anything weird about the dress, I would say it was the hemline. First, it felt a little short to me. It is not inappropriately short at all. But, considering my height (5'2\") and that I have short legs, it is uncommon for things to be short on me. Compared to the picture in the listing, I felt that this dress came a little shorter on me. Secondly, it is crossed over or overlapped. I know it shows that in the picture, but it didn't lay completely flat in that area for me. So, it just looked a little messy. As I go back and look at the listing pictures I see that the dress really hangs more on the model than it does on me. Considering it is described as a \"bodycon\" dress, you expect it to hug your body. Perhaps sizing up would fix that?And, the \"ruffle\"... I recognize that this is not my normal type of dress so this ruffle is a stretch for me. It is basically a piece of fabric that is just stitched only to the waistband. And, it just hangs. It's fine. It's not bad. It's just different for me.The aquamarine color is really a deep and rich color. It has that jewel tone feel to it. It is lovely.",

                "reviewText": "Good:+ Fits true to size.+ Looks nice.+ Value is overall OK for this price range.Bad:- Zipper is very stiff and won't easily zip past the seams. Seems like a design flaw!- Side fringe is sewn way too loose and easily flies everywhere and gets in the way. Not made for a windy place! Looked better in the product photos than in actuality.Other thoughts:- The material is thick, though it is a rougher polyester so a bit on the cheap side. However, I think it's what's to be expected at this price point.- The style didn't quite suit me. I'm a little \"stocky\" at this point in my life and I think it'd better suit someone with more slender arms.",
