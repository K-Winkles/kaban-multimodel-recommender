                "reviewText": "Such a lovely dress, has a great fit, it's super soft, very stretchy, looks very flattering to the body and has such great quality fabric. I loved this dress as soon as I tried it on, it just hugged my body and I feel like it popped out my curves nicely. It's great for many occasions, I highly recommend it. For Reference I'm 5'4 feet tall, 144lbs, 36D Chest, Ordered Size Small, Color Blue. It does run a bit bigger so if you prefer a more fitted fit, I would suggest sizing down. I'm normally medium size for clothing, but decided to order this one in \"small\" but it was a bit on the bigger side for me. The slit is on my left hand side and is super cute \ud83d\ude0d I will order another one in xs to see if I like it more since I love my dresses more fitted... Will update on it later. Here's an update with pictures of the blue dress.I really hope this was helpful\ud83d\ude0aUpdate Aug 27, 2023: So I ordered an XS in this dress and it fit waay better than the small more fitted, so I'm guessing The Drop runs a bit big for this dress since normally I'm a medium to small. I ordered it in brown, pink and white ( I'll update again with more pics) but wow the colors are beautiful \ud83d\ude0d Just get your correct desired size and you should be good \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",

I ordered an XXS and it fit perfectly. It's super stretchy and the length is right below the knee on me, which is what I wanted. The material is good quality and thick, but also breathable for wearing in the summer. I ended up ordering in more colors. So worth the price, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This dress is well made and soft! The sage color is very beautiful and it is petite friendly :) I ordered the XXS, I have a small waist to hip/butt/thigh ratio and read many reviews stating that it\u2019s a thick knit material that pulls down throughout the day so opted for the XXS. Although it did fit me perfectly, I returned the dress because it fit quite well (maybe too well) especially on the butt/hip area and the rest of the dress is form fitting, but I wanted the dress not to hug my hips/butt area as much. I am hoping the XS will flow out a bit more (like the drop Gabriela knit dress). The length is great, hit me mid calf and the slit is cute. I did not wear it long enough to notice the pull of the dress, but can see what the other reviewers are talking about due to the weight of the dress. Anyone considering this dress should give it a try!! It is beautiful, does not show lumps and bumps because material is very substantial (but not hot) and I feel it is quite true to size. The quality for the price is a good deal and the dress is simple, yet elegant!!",

                "reviewText": "I will start by saying the I love The Drop. Everything I have ever purchased has always been very high quality, great fabric, and nicely designed. This dress has a lot of that. The fabric is amazing. The design is nice and simple which is perfect for this sort of dress. The issue is the fit. This dress runs very large and the sizing is a bit off. I am a size 10 but a toned and tight 10. I am also losing weight. Because of this, I know that can impact sizing so I ordered a medium instead of my normal large. I have a butt and am pretty busty. This dress clings to my butt. I'm not crazy about this but as I lose more weight, that problem will be saved. But then in the chest, it is also too large. I am a DD so a medium should not be too large. It should fit more like in the butt area. Then under the breast, it is very loose. The fabric is very stretchy though so I would almost say that the medium should be for someone wearing a 12 or 14 if they wanted a fitted look. The sizing is just very off and odd for my body. I will likely return. I would still recommend this dress for the right body type because it is lovely and well made with high quality knit fabric.",

I nudge it back up. Not bad. I pull it up again. Hmm, I'd spend the whole night tugging it back into place? Umm, that's not a good look to see a woman repeatedly pulling her dress up! ha.
