Plenty of room for the girls, the band underneath the chest was elastic if you need extra room. The only complaint is that the sleeves were wayyy long, but I just pulled them to my elbows and let them hang over. It\u2019ll need to be steamed for wrinkles when you receive. But it was a great fit, weight, color ass perfect and length was exactly what I wanted!",

It is not see thru that i can tell, definitely need to stream it because it hits the wrinkles from the bag. My only beef is this little snap they put on the front for the cleavage area. It was way too high up so i took a seam ripper and took it off and safety pinned it much lower and it's fine.",

I am 5ft and 125lbs I just had a baby and thought this dress would be nice for my graduation since it was flowy and a v neck to nurse in. When it arrived the material was stiff and the neckline was weird. Since I am nursing I am bustier than usual so I got a medium. The dress was huge on me, but still almost small on my bust. The ruffle at the bottom wasn't what I expected and the sleeves were so long even when I pulled them up to my elbow they will went to my wrist. If you are tall and slim I think this would be an absolutely beautiful dress for you. If you are like me and on the smaller side with some meat on your bones then I would suggest the dress or I would say size down. If you are bustier stay away.",

This dress was AMAZING! It fit just right! The only complaint I had was the snap at the bust was tricky to keep snapped if I moved too much, easy fix with a safety pin. For reference I am a 16/18 pants, xl shirt and a 42E bra. I ordered the 2xl with a very comfortable fit. I could have sized down and would have needed to if my chest was a little smaller.",
