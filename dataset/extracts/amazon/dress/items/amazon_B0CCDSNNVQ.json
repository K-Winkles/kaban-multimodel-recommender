They're made well and the craftsmanship is fantastic. But, I'll have to say, I'm disappointed in this one.Like I said, I own many Grace Karin dresses, so of course I know my size. This one fit a LOT smaller than my others. Another thing is that the middle fit way too tight, it was extremely unflattering for my tummy. Since it was so small, it was uncomfortable as well. However, the only positive is that the material and stitching was still done well, as is usual for Grace Karin dresses.I hate to say it, but pass on this one.

                "reviewText": "It seems this dress fits best with a small/slim frame. There is not much room in the stomach/hip area. However, outside of that it is a fairly nice dress. The material is good quality, and there are no issues with fraying, color bleeding, or anything like that.I wouldn't say the material is very thick, so a sweater or something would be necessary for cooler weather.Overall a fairly decent product if you double-check your sizing and are height/weight proportionate.",

I am typically between a size small and size medium (6-8). I ordered a medium and could barely get it on. It was very tight in the chest and midsection. Everything else fit appropriately. Sadly, I cannot wear this dress.",
