                "reviewText": "Ordered my usual size in the black/gold star print, which should have fit per their size chart but it was too small around the bust. Also, if you're busty, be aware that the waistline of this dress is functionally a baby-doll and will make you look like a child.Worst though is the actual quality of the dress, which feels like a Halloween costume from a cheap superstore. It's very light, scratchy, nearly sheer... Like so light it clings to itself without any static. The stitching also felt flimsy. If this was a $20 piece of crap that'd be one thing, but $42??? There's a sucker born every minute.I had SUCH high hopes because the style is SO cute but it is just not well-made, even for a cheap piece of crap.",

I probably could have even gone down to a L if my breasts weren\u2019t so large. I did have to wear a bralette over my bra to cover my cleavage. But it wasn\u2019t anything inconvenient at all! I highly recommend this dress!",
