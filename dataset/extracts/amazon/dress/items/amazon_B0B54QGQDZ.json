I believe it had to do with the sewn in cups that only fits a particular body. The material was nice and the skirt was as I expected. I ordered a 12 and a 14 based on some comments and neither one fit, however the 12 fit better and I usually wear a 12. I need a black dress for my granddaughter's black tie wedding but this had to go back. If you want to take the chance on trying it, well if it fits you I don't think you will be disappointed although it was a little itchy from the mesh top and I only had it on for 5 minutes. I can only imagine what it would feel like after 10 hours but I have very sensitive skin. I'm giving it 3 stars since the cut of the dress will not fit all size 12 body's.",
