                "reviewText": "Definitely do not size up even if you are looking for the not too tight look like I was.I am 5 4 128lbs 34d 28waist 36hips usually wear small but mostly medium.I almost got a medium size to avoid a too tight look. Glad I went with small , it fits just right, with just the right amount of lose fit but still fitting and not tight like a burrito.The length is right below my knees. The cut of the dress is beautiful, is hard to find a solid color dress and the color is hot pink elegant not a bright highlighter . It has black and gold button details on the sleeves. Long zipper in the back and one slit on the front knee. The only reason I took one star off is because it is not lined so the material is a bit stretchy which is comfortable but you could see the pantilines and if you have a little belly it will show. So I used a high waisted tummy control lycra undergarment short and I feel like it did help a ton. Now the midsection looks smooth. I also suggest due to the material that you need to steam it a little for the perfect look. I pair it with nude pumps but you could do black as well depending on the handbag you use I guess.The price, a bit overpriced I think. But so is everything these days. So I am not complaining. I am happy and keeping it. Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a",

It's a dress you definitely want to wear shape wear with if you have a few extra pounds as it is very fitted. I really like the length and the slit just above the knee is a nice touch. Fabric quality is decent and not see thru at all. It was quite wrinkled from the packaging but I tossed it in the dryer for 5 mins and it came out looking perfect. A very nice dress for work or a special occasion.",
