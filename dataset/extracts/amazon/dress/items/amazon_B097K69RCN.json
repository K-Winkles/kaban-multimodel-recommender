                "reviewText": "EDIT: I\u2019d recommend purchasing the darker colors because these get oil stained VERY easily. Do not wear these with body oil and pretty much avoid oils/butters/Vaseline etc. when wearing the lighter colors. No cooking, changing diapers, etc. If you spill ranch or something similar on these it\u2019s a wrap unless it\u2019s a darker color.I own 5 of these & primarily use them on days where I need to throw something on quick & still look put together. They run a size larger & can be tent like if you\u2019re not careful. The size chart indicated that I should wear a M (36C/Size 8-10) but I found that it was too big & purchased a small which is just right. These dresses are also low cut as well for those that care. I don\u2019t like to wear camisoles under dresses (they roll up), so I just make do, but my baby has tried to expose me a couple of times. Lol. These are perfect for maternity as well because there\u2019s room to grow in the belly area. I didn\u2019t use them for that, but they\u2019re shaped exactly like the other maternity dresses that I wore during pregnancy. The only issue I have is that I don\u2019t 100% love the material. It\u2019s soft & feels nice (not cheap), but it does get wrinkly if you don\u2019t hang it up & I think the wrinkles do eventually fall out, but it\u2019s inconvenient when first putting the dress on. I wish it was wrinkle free from the get go. Otherwise these dresses are pretty good & affordable. They\u2019re flattering around the stomach & not too loose in the waist. Some dresses can make you look shapeless, but this doesn\u2019t. I would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I needed some modest but attractive, casual, not too expensive dresses to wear to Church on Sunday and on similar types of occasions where I want to look decent, but I am not interested in really \"dressing up.\" Almost all of the clothes I see on Amazon seem to be targeted to women in their teens, twenties, and maybe thirties. For women past 40, 50, 60, and above, it is really difficult to find anything tasteful to buy.I am a retired senior who does not want to flash my legs, bum, and bosom to the rest of the world, but I want to look nice and presentable. Before I retired, I shopped at Brooks Brothers for my work wardrobe. BB has high quality tailored suits and dresses, but they are expensive, high end garments, and they are a little too formal to wear just to Church on Sundays and to similar types of occasions where there is no need to look like a highly polished professional. So, what is a nice old lady like me to do??Luckily, I found these Amazon essential maxi dresses which cover all of the bases for me. The dresses are well cut and have good weight for the price point, so they hang well on the body, and the colours are really pretty. The fabric does not breathe as well as cotton, but given all of the pros, including a very reasonable price point, I cannot fault them too very much. They look nice on, and I can dress them up or down with shoes, jewellery, hats, scarves, etc. That is the good news. The bad news is they shrink A LOT.Firstly, know that they run very large out of the packaging. I am 5'7 and at present weigh 162 lbs. Normally, at this price point, I would wear an XL, but in these dresses, an XL was much too large. So, I reordered the Confetti colour and the Solid Black colour in L and in M. The L was still much too large, and the M, whilst it seemed to fit well across the shoulders and under the arms, seemed a bit too long. In my stocking feet, it grazed the tops of my feet almost to the point of pooling. So, I ordered another one in size S just to see if perhaps the S would be a better fit. The S fit, but I decided the M probably worked the best overall as it left over a little room if (heaven forbid!) I gained any more weight.Well, I washed both dresses together in cold water on the gentle cycle in an agitator-less washing machine. I dried them together on the delicate cycle for maybe 15 minutes max. They were still quite damp out of the dryer. I hung them to finish drying in the air overnight. The next day I was shocked to find that the solid Black colour shrank about 2 sizes. The Black-Confetti colour shrank a little, but it did not shrink nearly as much as the solid Black dress. As I said, both were washed and dried together, so I am at a complete loss to explain why the solid Black one shrunk so badly, but the Black-Confetti one only shrunk a little.I did some research on Google re Rayon fabric to try to find some answers. I discovered that Rayon is NOT a synthetic fabric like polyester for example. It is made from wood pulp, and it is pretty much guaranteed to shrink considerably. In fact, it will likely shrink a little each time you wash it up to 20% shrinkage in total, and that translates to 1-2 sizes. The articles I read said Rayon shrinks even in cold water and should never be put in the dryer even on delicate heat, and it should never be sent to the dry cleaners. Well, now I know.....My advice is to order up at least one size than your normal size. Save all packaging. Wash in cold water on the gentle cycle, and line dry afterward. Once dry, try the dress(s) on again to see how much it shrunk. If it shrunk so much as to be small and uncomfortable, document it and send it back.I have not had a great deal of luck buying clothes on Amazon, but I am not keen on shopping at malls, so I keep trying my luck on Amazon. I may have to steel myself to start shopping at the mall again. Whilst the price point on these dresses is very good, if you cannot rely on them not to have problems like this even though you follow the washing instructions, then you are better off shopping the sales at Macy's, Neiman's, JCP, Lord & Taylor, Bergdorf's, etc., etc.So, to sum up, I really like the style, the fit, and the fabric, but I do not like the inconsistency in shrinkage and the aggravation of having to return dresses. I think the best way to avoid this problem is to size up, wash in cold, line dry, and then see how much your dress has shrunk. If necessary, send it back!ETA: Well, I reordered the solid black in XL. I washed in cold and put in the dryer on delicate for a few minutes. The dress was still quite damp out of the dryer. I hung it on a hanger on the shower rod to finish drying. I expected it would shrink 2 sizes like the M size did, but to my amazement, the XL did not shrink or only minimally. I thought I outsmarted this dress by ordering an XL to allow for shrinkage by 2 sizes, but this one did not shrink. I noted, too, that the fabric on this one seemed MUCH thinner than on the first ones I ordered. I am not sure what do now. Should I reorder the black in L or in M? Should I expect them to shrink or not? Will the fabric be very thin like this last XL was? The inconsistency in these dresses is really frustrating.... Your mileage may vary. Good luck!",

The green floral print is pretty. The length is perfect. There are 3 things I would change, but can live with because the price is great. The surplice neckline is a bit low if you are a conservative dresser. Being an elementary teacher, this could be a problem. There are a couple work arounds though, first, I can just pin it or velcro it to keep it from opening to wide; also, I can use a little inset that attaches to my bra straps and places a little fabric to cover my cleavage; or a third option is to wear a light camisole. Another issue is the lack of pockets, I would love this with pockets, but I can live without them. The biggest problem is there are not enough color and print options for the bigger sizes. Amazon needs to realize that bigger size women are desperately trying to find pretty clothes at a reasonable price. That would mean more sales for them.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5ft 10 - 185 lbs ordered Large - fits perfect - about 2-3 inches from the bottom of my feet, Its extremely comfortable, so much so I ordered two more in different colours, every time I have worn this particular colour I have received many compliments. Washes well, and has kept its shape, I hang it to dry as I am tall and do not want any shrinkage in the length so don't risk the dryer.This dress can be dressed up or down with jewelry and shoes and cannot beat this price as not even $40",
