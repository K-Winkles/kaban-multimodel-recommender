I wear them all the time, whether it's to church or just out running errands. It's a versatile dress that works for many different occasions and seasons. I think it will look great paired with a jean jacket and sneakers for fall. I love that there are pockets. The v-neck is just right on me and not too revealing. I love the length too. I'm 5'4\" and it hits mid calf. Overall, I'm really happy with this dress and I'm glad I got 2. Would recommend.",

I usually order one size up in foreign made clothing on Amazon but read tons of reviews as well to decide.cWhen I tried holding back the extra fabric behind me, it was really fantastic and could be worn for so many occasions. You can wear is for a casual beach look with tennies or sandals or dress it up with some jewelry and nicer shoes. The black is a nice, saturated, deep color and the workmanship on the garment was good. There were no loose threads or other issues. It was a very cute style and would be flattering on just about any figure if you get the right size.",

                "reviewText": "I have always had a go-to denim skirt or jumper. With a fair bit of international travel under my belt having one of those saves on space and items as well as being modest and comfortable. No, this is not the demnin because I've given up finding what I want.This dress seemed like a reasonable alternative. Here is the breakdown of pro/con.Pro: Comfortable, lightweight, has pockets (a BIG plus). It probably can handle a thin short sleeve top if needed (not an item in my wardrobe right now). I have kimono style cover ups that will work just fine.Con: Gaps in underarm (easily fixed). Price is a bit high IMHO. This next point may just be buyer beware. My issue is color. I bought the navy blue but am hard pressed to know if it is navy or black. I had a similar problem with two J.Jill purchases of black and navy slacks. I had to write with permanent marker to be able to distinguish one from the other. Just had my son weigh in and he said black and had a similar issue with Carhartt once. Odds are whoever pulled it couldn't tell the difference either.Bottom Line? That's up to you. If they had a denim blue I'd buy again. It hasn't been washed yet so that is a wait and see.P. S. I took a photo in natural light, it looked blue. Then I took one in the sunlight and it looked black. Make of that what you will.\ud83d\ude43",
