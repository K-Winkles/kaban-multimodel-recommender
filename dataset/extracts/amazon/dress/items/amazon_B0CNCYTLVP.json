                "reviewText": "I sized down with this dress and I'm glad I did. It fits perfectly. It's still loose enough without being too mu mu like. The fabric is soft and thick enough that you can't see through it. Around the house, I can easily wear it without a bra which was what I was looking for. And the pockets are large enough to hold my cell phone which is great. It's not overly long, I'm 5'4\" and it falls 4-5 inches below my knee.The only negative for me is that it's hand wash and dry flat.",

POCKETS!I really love where this dress hits, well below the knee. It won't ride up while sitting down.This dress could be layered for warmth or appreciated as is, in warmer weather.Edited to add: I wore it to work today and now I'm buying it in every color.",

Mid-calf length for me (5\u20194\u201d), and the XL was plenty roomy (I\u2019m usually a 16). Definitely more of a summer moo-moo than a flirty sundress. But I feel like I could wear it to work with some cute shoes, since it\u2019s more full coverage than lots of summer dresses.",
