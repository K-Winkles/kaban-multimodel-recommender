I used a thin, solid colored belt instead of the included fabric one.Casual look, good for a baby shower or birthday party but not a wedding or evening event. Got lots of compliments.Sizing - 5'6\" , 36DD, 30\" waist. Large was a slightly loose fit and hit a little below the knee. Waist fell higher than natural waist, not quite empire but close. Arm holes and sleeves are comfortably sized.",

Creo que pude haber pedido la talla grande sin problema. Mido 1.58 y tengo las piernas muy cortas, el vestido me queda por debajo de la rodilla.",
