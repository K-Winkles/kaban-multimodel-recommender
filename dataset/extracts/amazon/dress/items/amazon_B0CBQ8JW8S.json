With the coupon for $18 off the dress came to less than $25 dollars. I got so many compliments on the style that I purchased another dress in a different color. Thanks Grace Karin!",

I washed and dried it on cool/low temps and it came out beautifully and ready to wear. The fabric is soft and silky in feel, even the lace-like fabric of the arms (no scratchiness). The bust area is a little boxy and not as flattering as I had hoped. However, a belt and cardigan broke up the line making it definitely workable. In fact, I received many positive comments about the dress when I wore it at the office.",

The sleeves were too oversized for my taste, the shoulders were not appealing at all. It is a good length on a 5'4 lady. It's not my favorite cut for my body frame. My daughter tried it on and she is super skinny and it still didn't look good on her. Wish it would've worked out well for me.",

It fit like a dream in regard to dimensions. The only drawback that I experienced was how it is cut. Now that I am a fuller figured woman (size 12-14), I am unable to wear dresses that are cut above the waist. I should have payed more attention to the photo details. The waist falls slightly above the naval, which is high enough for me to look like I am expecting. I suggest a support girdle if this is an issue you have as well. Otherwise, it's a winner.",
