                "reviewText": "I recently ordered the GRACE KARIN Ruffled Flowy Swing Dress with Tie Waist in black, and I'm absolutely in love with it! I'm 5'5\", and it falls right at my knees. I have to say, this dress seems to run true to size, if not a bit large. Being pear-shaped, I find the style of this dress extremely flattering and comfortable to wear. I believe the neckline's v-neck would be flattering to both large and small bustlines, as it has some blousing, but the cut is not so deep or plunging that you couldn't wear it to work or church.I was worried about the sleeves being too billowy, but they are not ridiculously big like the pirate shirt from that Seinfeld episode. I also worried that the ruffle design would be too much, but it's not. The ruffles are just enough to make the dress less plain and more feminine. The material is basically a poly blend and isn't super thick, but it has a nice weight for a good drape. It feels slightly silky, which is nice next to the skin, and washed well. I did hang dry, but I don't think one would have to do so.I ordered black, so I don't have to worry about visibility through the skirt, but I can't speak to the lighter colors of the dress. The funny thing about this dress is that it can be very casual or more dressy, depending on how and where you choose to wear it. For example, it's winter here, and I recently wore this to work layered with leggings and a contrasting cardigan. But I can easily see wearing this in the spring or early summer with strappy sandals to go out to eat, etc.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really pretty dress. When I saw it, it was almost instant that I wanted to get it home and try it out. I loved the design of the dress, it screams feminine quite well. The delicate baby pink color is so flattering on. The v-neck with the cinched waist is also very flattering. This dress has stretch to it, and I ordered up, and think I could have just gone with my regular size. But nonetheless, this fits great and feels even better. The design is professionally created. They do offer this style in two other colors, white and a baby blue. All are equally attractive.The material is super soft and stretchy, as I mentioned. This is a simple dress to care for with a machine wash. Offered in sizes S- XXL. The dress fits nicely and I'm also 5'9, so the length does work, maybe shorter than on others, but I love where it actually lays. I like that this dress can be worn in many different ways, and events. Whether for a summer night out, or a Sunday trip to church. It is very well put together. The price point is perfect for the quality. Based on these facts, I would for sure recommend this to other consumers. The comfort plus the fact it is so body flattering, I'm all in. Thanks for reading my review, I do hope it was informative and helpful. :)",

                "reviewText": "I want to say I would love this dress a little more if it just didn't have the fabric coming from the neckline to the sleeves - it's almost a little too much (for me).Otherwise I love the color and the fit is true to size. The fabric is also soft, lightweight and it has a built-in slip underneath. Very prairie/western feel to it. If I had some western boots to pair up with it, I probably would. The cut is flattering and fits for my body type (tall/broad) without being self-consciously short.Overall: I like it, but I had to take a single star off for the trim - it just seems a little silly-looking to me.",

The Medium fits well, I think I might even have been able to size down to a Small because the waist is elastic. But not sure if the chest would pull with the smaller size. If you\u2019re smaller than me in the bust, definitely size down. The color is a beautiful baby blue and the ruffles are very sweet. I am 5\u20194\u201d and this hit me at the knee.",

                "reviewText": "This dress, ordered in black medium, is a very flattering style, with the ruffles and slim waist. The ruffles go down the sleeve in an interesting way. The fabric is not as breathable as our hot weather would require, but I will wear it in spring and fall. The ruffled bottom is a nice touch and I like the v-neck (much more flattering). The price is reasonable for the design quality.",

The flow when you move is graceful and complementary to any body size/shape.I appreciate the great fabric, Grace Karin quality, and the easy washability of the dress. I have washed it several times and always hang it dry. It washes really well and needs no ironing.",
