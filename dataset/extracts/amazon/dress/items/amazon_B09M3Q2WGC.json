The material is nice, not too clingy and not itchy. I'm 5,3 and it was a great length for not too short. It hit just at my knees",

                "reviewText": "I seldom buy dresses without trying them on in the store. So I was wondering how this would look. I LOVE IT! The material is thick and has lots of stretch to it. I want to say that the fabric is heavy but in a good way. It hides any flaws and it drapes nicely across your midsection due to the ruching. The dress flows nicely and is not overly frilly. The draping of the sleeves is also flattering, hiding any flaws you think you may have.Although I got the wrong size (I received and XL), I am happily exchanging it for a medium and hoping this will be the dress I can use as my 'little black dress' for different events coming up. I am 5' tall and about 135 so I always have a tough time finding a nice fit in anything. I believe you can wear this to any event in any season. Stay tuned to see how it fits once I get the medium....",

Covered my chest perfect and I love the flutter sleeves. Literally a perfect dress EXCEPT the length for me. I'm 28yrs old and the length made it seem more middle aged in my opinion. I personally felt 20 years older in this. Very flattering and modest and probably what I should go for but it just wasn't for me. If it was just a little shorter & more above the knee, I would love.

The Xl was still to snug all over. The XXL fit but the seam under the bust was sewn crooked and went on an angle across chest. Ended up returning all of them. The material is cheap and scratchy to the touch, but it looks very pretty from a distance. The dress itself is so flattering. I really wanted it to work out. Both the dark green and the dark cranberry red are beautiful colors. So much potential",
