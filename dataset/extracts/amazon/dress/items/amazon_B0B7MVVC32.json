                "reviewText": "I really like the dress; it is a very classic, feminine style, and the pleating is lovely. The dress definitely runs on the large side, though. I'm 5'4\" and 125 lbs, and it'll definitely work, but an xs probably would have been perfect (I'm usually a small-medium). Thankfully there's a belt on the waist that can pull it in, so the silhouette is still flattering. Also, the sleeves are very sheer and the arm holes are very deep, so I'll be wearing a black long-sleeve t-shirt underneath for modesty, which will also work fine. The fabric feels like good quality, and it really is a beautiful dress that I'm glad I purchased.",

My issue is the waist line, since I\u2019m tall my torso is longer and this dress is made for people with short torso. I can shorten the waist tie hoops to try keeping the waist tie from sliding down, but I think the seam will be visible and kind of ruins the look. I think I\u2019ll keep the dress, It would\u2019ve been perfect if the dress didn\u2019t have the visible seam.",

Things I did like: 1.) the material was nice feeling and lightweight, 2.) the sizing was spot on, 3.) the skirt length was exactly where I expected to be, 4.) it looked exactly like the pictures, and 5.) the stitching seemed to be well done with no loose threads or snags. If it had looked better on me I definitely would have kept it.",
