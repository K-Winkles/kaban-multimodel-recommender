The higher waist/short torso design of this dress can make you look heavier than you are. In my case, it hides my hips (which I don't like) and doesn't emphasize my narrow waist. So I look fat. Plenty of women will look amazing in this dress, and I still intend to wear it for casual stuff around the house. Even if it's not for me, I can appreciate it, and it gets 5 stars!",

They can hold a phone, but it's a tight fit.The top part of this dress is made of stretchy material, making it more giving for the chest area. The length is more conservative, going close to the ankles in my case. I got a large, but if you would like it to be longer, I would recommend going up a size.This dress is nicely made and overall very beautiful, functional, and very versatile. The color is vibrant.

It's very well cut and flattering on the body; true to size. Lightweight, this would make a great summer dress, but it also looks great over tights and with a sweater on. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "I am really disappointed in this white dress. The description says it is lined, but this is a misnomer. The top part is one layer of thin, see-through white fabric. The skirt has two layers: a similar thin, see-through fabric covered by the thicker white eyelet embroidered fabric. Obviously this top layer has holes by design, so even the combination of the two is not enough to ensure that people won't see your underwear. You will need a full-body slip to wear this white dress--which, to me, negates the point. It seems to be true to size--I am 5'7, 160 lb, and the medium fits well. Shame I won't be able to wear it. Maybe the other colors are better? Wish I'd gotten the black.",
