It\u2019s airy and floaty - it literally just emanates springtime beauty.It has the typical Grace Karin qualities - excellent fabric, strong seams and stitching and - wonderfully affordable! Is my \u2018go to\u2019 brand when I need something classy to wear. I love it.The dress is lined, however, it still has the easy care instructions on the label. I machine washed mine on delicate and hung it to dry. It seems almost true to size, but it is pretty loose on me. If you want a more fitted look, you might choose to size down.This is a fabulous springtime dress. I hope it works out just as well for you!",

(I\u2019m 6\u20197, 165lbs) I do think I could have fit in a medium, but the elastic band is snug on me so I don\u2019t mind it being a little on the bigger size. It does look a bit old lady-ish on me, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the print or the dress being a little too big. I mostly like it! The quality is good. It\u2019s not see though, the fabric is thicker than expected. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d pay $40 bucks for another one, but if you can catch this on a sale, it could be worth it! I got it for work and it\u2019s comfy, so I\u2019m happy!",

                "reviewText": "I loved the pattern of the material that this dress is made from. It did not disappoint when it arrived. The material is soft and flowy. The colors are beautiful. The stitching is even. The short flutter sleeves are fashionable and complementary. The blue and green color combination remind me of the ocean. The pleated skirt does not add bulk but allows the skirt to swing and flow. I do not like to wear a slip. The skirt has a knee legenth built in slip and the bottom section lets your legs show through. This is very attractive. The dress fits according to size. I can't wait for warm weather to wear this dress. I haven't bought an Easter dress in years but this dress will be my Easter dress this year!",

                "reviewText": "This dress is lovely! The print (we got the blue and pink flowers) is very pretty, feminine, and complimentary. The cut is very nice as well. The only issue I have with the dress is that I am a little bit overweight and the skirt seems to add 10 pounds to me because it is accordian-like with creases. Other than that, I love the neckline and longer sleeves. I wear dresses and skirts all the time and I really feel like a beautiful creation of God and get a lot of respect from men. A dress like this is so pretty and would help a woman feel wonderful!",
