It depends if you want a looser fit or a tighter fit. I have chemical allergies, so organic clothes is all I buy. I had to return a few of these dresses because it seems that they were treated with some type of chemical. Maybe to get rid of wrinkles or to deodorize them? Who knows! Please don\u2019t do that! It defeats the purpose of buying organic clothing. I\u2019m 5\u201d4\u2019 and weigh 130 lbs.",

Also... ich kann wirklich nicht sagen, dass es einem Nachthemd \u00e4hnlich ist. Dies w\u00fcrde bei einigen Rezensionen beanstandet. Es tr\u00e4gt sich toll und ist von guter Qualit\u00e4t.
