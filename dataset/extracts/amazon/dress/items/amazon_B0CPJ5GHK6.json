                "reviewText": "I own several Grace Karin items that have been true to size and well constructed. This dress is no exception. I ordered the XL based on the size chart, and it fits perfectly. Usually I'm hesitant about wrap dresses, as I have a lot of trouble with them falling open, but this dress does not have that problem. I wear a 36F, and the top fit without straining.I like that this is a faux wrap with a zipper, so I don't have to worry about the belt slipping. The dress has a knee-length underlayer as well. The fabric is lovely and comfortable, making this dress a winner for events such as weddings. The royal blue color is true to the product photos.The model in the product photos must be much, much taller than me. At 5'5\" the hem is three inches short of my ankles. I'd like it to hit more mid-calf, but I don't see an easy way to alter it due to the construction of the wrap layers. Nevertheless, I think I'll find multiple places to wear this item.",

It could be due to sizing but if I sized down, the bottom would be too small. On a positive note, the color is pretty and it\u2019s a quality material. Just an odd cut.

                "reviewText": "Grace Karen clothing is really impressing me! Every piece I've owned has been a winner so far and this is no exception.Nice quality fabrics. True to size. Brilliant colors. And flattering fit.I'm pretty balanced bottom to top, and hourglass, but my waist is getting less defined with age. It fits my largish chest nicely without being to revealing, but it does fit close on my hips and stomach. This particular dress has a closer pencil skirt cut so I'm going to need some shape wear to make it look nice. So, I wouldn't recommend for pear shaped ladies. It works for hourglass pretty well if you good with a close fitting skirt. It would be FANTASTIC for those that are larger on top and have smaller hips!!! I'm sure that body type that can be difficult to find a nice fitting dress and this would be perfect!For the price, the quality, the color, and fit are a great value! Totally recommend!",

                "reviewText": "A few years ago, I had a side hustle selling retro style dresses that I imported from Hong Kong and mainland China. There was some hit and miss with quality but Grace Karin dresses are always hits. Their quality surpasses peer suppliers. They are well made and figure flattering.I am 5\u20196\u201d and weigh 160. I wear a D38 bra and carry a lot of weight on my butt and thighs as well as some on my stomach. There is plenty of chest room. It\u2019s flattering for my size but could definitely fit someone with a larger cup size. The style is cut so that you can still have a torso- if you know what I mean. Often, my larger cup size results in my bust line and waistline being one and the same. Not so with this dress.Where this dress isn\u2019t working for me is my thighs. This is not the dress\u2019s fault, the donuts are to blame. It\u2019s nothing that a little shape wear can\u2019t overcome. But I need to overcome my dislike of shape wear. Or cut out the donuts.",

                "reviewText": "This dress is absolutely gorgeous. Initially, I was concerned that the fabric might be of lesser quality or too thin, but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The material drapes beautifully, and the ruching on the front of the dress helps to conceal any midsection insecurities. I opted for black and it looks fantastic. The dress isn't sheer, so there's no need for a slip or anything of the sort underneath. It's versatile enough to wear for any occasion, and I personally think it's perfect for a dinner date.",

The waist in particular just didn\u2019t sit right for her. Others may have a different experience. The garment itself is pretty good quality. Giving four stars with the benefit of the doubt that this may be suitable and stylish on others.",

                "reviewText": "This dress is a perfect balance between comfort and style. The fabric has a weight to it, which helps the ruffled sleeves and the layers fall flatteringly around my body. It is listed as a wrap dress, but it has a zipper in back allowing you to step into the dress because the rest is stitched. It allows everything to stay exactly where it should be without constantly tightening the tie around your waist. I appreciated the zipper design. I ordered the blue green, and it arrived the same color as advertised. I am 5\u20196\u201d and this dress fell to mid-calf, which was longer than it appeared in the product photos (I guess I am not model height\u2026) This dress has the potential to be casual enough for work, but can also be dressed up for a night out. There are a few layers of fabric and the sewing was well done. This dress has a quality feel to it and moves well as I walk. I am very pleased with this dress and can\u2019t wait to wear it to more events!",

                "reviewText": "I would like to start by saying that I have purchased several Grace Karin items for myself and my daughters and have been very happy with their quality and versatility. They are usually well made, flattering and wash well, so I was really excited about this dress. I am 5'4\" and 140 lbs, I usually wear a size 4/6, and according to my measurements I ordered a small. The color is absolutely beautiful, a deep, vivid blue and the material is soft and flowy. Unfortunately when I removed this from the bag, the dress had the most horrible overpowering odor that made me very nauseous and sent me into an asthma attack. I don't even know how to describe the odor, but it was so strong that when my husband (who is pretty oblivious to smells) walked into the room he commented, \"What is that smell?!\" I did try the dress on and was further saddened that it is very tight in the top and across the stomach and derriere and very short waisted. Hoping that the odor would come out, I have washed the dress twice according to the directions and hung to dry and it still exudes a very strong odor. Because of the sizing issues but more importantly the strong odor, I will not be able to wear this dress.",
