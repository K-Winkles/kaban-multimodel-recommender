Based on the size chart I originally ordered a large, but it was way to big in the chest (I wear a 34/36C)...so if you are well endowed in that area it would fit well. I did exchanged for a medium and it fit perfectly. I was worried that the medium would be way to tight across the hips and butt, but was pleasantly suprised. I have a 32\" inseam and it hit mid thigh, not too short that I can't wear it to work. The first one I purchased was red and it's a really pretty color and like pictured....but I changed my mind to black since I will get more wear out it. It's vey versatile cut so you can wear a shirt underneath it, alone, or with a jacket/sweater over. There is some wrinkling out of the package, but nothing a steamer can't handle. 100% worth the price and I look forward to wearing it this winter here in TX.",

Great sales price at made this dress an exceptional purchase.I loved the fit & comfort of this dress. Paired easily with a mock turtleneck, tights & boots & kept me warm throughout a south Texas cool weather day. I felt so put together & was nicely complimented. I did order up in size just in case.
