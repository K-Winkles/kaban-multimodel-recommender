Fits great, comfortable and I love that the shoulder straps adjust. Very girlie and boho at the same time. Perfect for summer or vacay.",

But the quality is great!The reason I offed a star is because I ordered two dresses in different colors: brown and beige. The brown one wasn\u2019t like a solid light brown it looked as though it had a purple/pink undertone or tint in person and the beige one looked more like a light yellow vanilla. Call me crazy on colors or I\u2019m just color blind (because my mom thought it was brown but comparison to the picture to real life I can tell) I don\u2019t like it I really wanted all brown. The purplish looks nice but it makes me more princessy.Both of them look like princess dresses (not tried on) which in the picture it looked more like shaman colors to me.I still think it\u2019s worth getting the dress. I mean the quality is great and it\u2019s a cute dress. \ud83d\udc95I\u2019m debating to get the white one now and see how that comes out and see which ones to return.
