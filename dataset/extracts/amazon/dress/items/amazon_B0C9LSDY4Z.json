No bra needed bc it\u2019s very supportive and tight. So comfy and hugs all the right curves! Also the material is very breathable. True to size it is a little short but not bad!",

The material is thick enough to cover any imperfections and is not see through, but lightweight enough to remain cool. The wide strap detail on the top is very flattering and the length for her height was perfect. We purchased the brown, which is a very soft dark brown color. Quality was excellent for the price, definitely a keeper. Could wear out to dinner as she did or during an active day.",

I\u2019ve worn it with heels and with sneakers. The material is stretchy and very comfortable! There is an underlining too but it was a bit shorter in length than the outside part of the dress but that didn\u2019t bother me.",
