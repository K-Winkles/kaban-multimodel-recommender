I was worried the pattern may be too busy, but I really like it. I think it helps to leave the neck untied.I am currently 34 weeks pregnant, so it's nice that it is also maternity friendly, but this will definitely remain a favorite after baby too.I am 5'9\", normally 140ish lbs, and a true US size 6 (my shape has not changed other than my bump). Normally I would get a small or medium in dresses depending on the brand and desired fit.I have found this brand to run on the larger side in the past so I got a size small and am glad I did. It is still plenty oversized. If you are between sizes, size down.If you are more petite, you may want to skip this one. The length skims right at my ankle bone and I think the oversized fit combined with the print would overwhelm a smaller frame like a carnival tent (it might even do that on me and I just don't know it!).",

                "reviewText": "I think this dress is decent. The pattern wasn\u2019t as cute up-close (it\u2019s a very cartoon floral - almost like something from the 60s). That said, the cut is nice and the quality seems fairly good. Do keep in mind the dress runs LARGE - I ordered according to the chart and the XL is definitely too big for my size 16 self. (For reference, I\u2019m 5\u20199, 212 lbs, 40DDD) It looks better with a belt, but I will definitely need to tailor the dress\u2019s waist to be more flattering.",

It shouldn't be dried in dryer because it tends to shrink a bit. I mostly wash my dresses of this material in washer and air dry it.",
