                "reviewText": "Needed a dress for a winter wedding, and felt my existing wardrobe bare-armed choices would all leave me a bit chilly\u2026 so I started shopping around. Everything I found in stores was either a) wayyyy too short - I\u2019ve got a great pair of legs but I\u2019m 5\u201911\u201d and almost 50 and really want to be able to sit down without showing everyone my nether region; b) granny type dresses that look like I\u2019m heading back to the home after the wedding, or c) outrageously priced - I\u2019m all about investing in classic pieces but there\u2019s only so many cocktail dresses I need at this point and Id rather use the $ to buy the couple a nice gift.So, I came searching on Amazon, and found several sellers offering a similar style dress. I purchased two from two different sellers and the Merokeety was by far and away the loveliest choice.I am 5\u201911\u201d and 142 lbs, so tall and on the thinner side. I ordered a small which is my normal size. The dress is true to size. A small fit me snuggly in that it highlights my curves and is form fitting, but the material is forgiving and stretchy. Love the fit and felt it was so much nicer in the merokeety branded dress. Most dresses are pretty short on me but this dress hits me at just about the knee - so I can dance and move around and not worry about flashing anyone. Also doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind of dress/material that rides up on the legs a lot so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be adjusting my skirt all night. It\u2019s not the most expensive feeling material but it doesn\u2019t look cheap or poorly made at all. I love that the Merokeety dress has a zipper up the back as well - it just feels more properly fitted and higher end because of it. The color I ordered was a pretty wine red, a very pretty and a rich, deep color. Overall it\u2019s an attractive dress and I feel sexy in it even if it\u2019s not the sexiest dress on the planet by itself\u2026 it\u2019s what I would call sophisticated sexy if that\u2019s a thing. Sort of like what I would picture silver screen sirens wearing - it kind of reminds me of something I\u2019ve seen Sophia Loren in, actually.The only con? The sleeves are a tad short for me, but I have long arms so that\u2019s expected. I like the way the dress looks with the sleeves falling off the shoulder which resolves my issue with sleeve length completely.Overall, very pleased with this dress and highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter found this dress by searching my Amazon account. The dress arrived quickly. Fits very nice. She's a medium. The sleeves were a little big, not very much. The color is gorgeous and looks like the photo.The length is nice, about 1 to 2 inches below the knee.There's opportunity to raise the dress some for more pleats throughout and a shorter above the knee dress experience.I'd buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Overall the dress is nice, but I have to hitch it up a bit to fall at a flattering length (I'm 5'4\" and 145 lbs--got a medium). The zipper bulges out in the back, especially after ruching the skirt. Since I got the black, I can kind of tuck in the fold of excess zipper to hide it, but that would not work with a brighter color. I could make it work better if I got it altered, but I'm not going to spend the money for that, and I'm not confident I could alter it myself without ruining it.So, if you are tall or curvy, the dress might fit better on your body type (I've got more of an \"athletic\" build--not hourglass).",
