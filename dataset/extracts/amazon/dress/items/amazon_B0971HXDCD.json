It\u2019s extremely flattering. I carry my fat in my belly and it camouflaged it pretty well. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like it because it looked kind of plain but I needed a green dress for a school function. This for the bill for a business/casual dress. I took a star away because it\u2019s a little long (I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and it comes just below my knees) and the fabric is white on the inside of the dress, which I\u2019m just not sure about. Other than that, it\u2019s really amazing!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this dress because I was asked to wear all black as a volunteer at a conference. I was looking for something comfortable, and casual enough to wear with sneakers, but somewhat professional, as I was hoping to meet possible future employers.The good: The dress was very flattering and comfortable. It looked cute with sneakers. The fabric was super soft and breathable.The bad: I was required to wear a name badge on a lanyard around my neck. At the end of the 1 day conference, the area under the badge had pilled due to the friction of the badge. (A typical light weight paper badge encased in a vinyl holder. Nothing unusually heavy.)So, the dress fulfilled its purpose, but only looked decent for 1 wearing. And, of course, since it's been worn and washed, I can't return it.If you're only looking for a comfy dress to wear around the house, this dress would probably be fine, but if you plan to do normal activities out of the house, such as wearing a name badge, carring a purse, or anything that might create the slightest bit of friction, I would look for something different.",

                "reviewText": "Loved: light, comfortable fabric, flattering fit that visually reduces the tummy, pockets, variety of patterns and colors, length, and the versatility to wear out on a summer day with sandals or wear to work with a sweater or blazer and flats.Don't love: have to pin the chest because it is too revealing for work and the fabric wears quickly. I washed the first floral dress on cold in a regular setting ang hung it to dry without reading the reviews. The material looked faded and pilled.After reading the reviews, I washed the second one (navy blue with red flowers) inside-out in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle and hung it to dry. It looked better but still had that fuzzy sheen.I washed my third (black with polka dots) and fourth (tan animal print) ones the same way and they were both fine. The tan one fared best because of its light color.I have not worn or washed the fifth one (red with white flowers). I don't like this one as much. It's tomato red and the big flowers feel cartoonish, almost like Minnie Mouse. But I might try hand-washing from now on. I have not dried any of these in the dryer, but I imagine that would ruin the fabric.For reference, I ordered size large and usually wear a size 12. I am 5'6.5\" and weigh 175. Bust size is 40C. The dresses all fit nicely in my opinion.",
