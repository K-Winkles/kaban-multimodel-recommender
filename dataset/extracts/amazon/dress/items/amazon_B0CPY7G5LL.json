                "reviewText": "Grace Karin is one of my favorite go to brands when shopping online. Their pieces are great quality and oh so flattering on my body. This number didn't disappoint! It's an elegant and exquisite dress with such a stylish yet classy design. Love it! It makes for a perfect cocktail dress that is fun, yet, still dressy and sophisticated. The blueish green color is ooh la la, looks just as pictured, and makes the dress stand out even more in my opinion. I ordered this in L, my typical dress size and the size is fairly true to size. I wouldn't necessarily suggest going up or down in size, but there was a tad bit of looseness in the top and waist area. I am a size 11/12, very curvy on the bottom and size S or M on top, so sometimes a fit can be slightly off. It's not noticeable enough for me to return, but I may pin the top near the waist wrap, wear a thin belt, or have it altered a tad bit so it fits my top perfectly. The wrap helps to define your waistline and just adds to the subtle sexiness of this dress. If you are in between sizes however, it may be a good idea to go for the smaller size. This dress has a nice stretch to it! The material just melts onto your skin. Wonderful design that's gorgeous on even without a shaper (which I will be wearing btw lol). I wasn't a fan of the slip underneath, because it kept rising, so I pulled it up and it was much better. As previously stated, I will be wearing a shaper with this, because I just feel that most, if not all dresses should been worn with them so there's no jiggling of any kind \ud83d\ude02. But, this dress did well concealing most imperfections. Overall, I'm a big fan of this style and highly recommend it for all body types.",

                "reviewText": "Grace Karin is my new fave designer! I ordered a size medium in the dress, as I typically take a size 6-8 in women's clothing. This dress is long and came down to about my shins. I love the asymmetrical ,off the shoulder design on top, as well as the faux wrap around tie at the midsection. The material is very soft and has a bit of stretch to it. It is a nice quality material and appears to be made well. There is a side zipper to assist with getting the dress on and off. I ordered the navy blue color. I felt like it wasn't exactly a true navy, but had a hint of cobalt in it. I still thought it was a pretty color. The dress is very flattering and will look elegant for a night out with a pair of heels. My husband liked the dress on me as well and was very complimentary. This one is a winner!",

I ordered medium and it fits just perfect!The front overlap thingy ties on the right side. You can make it a bow or just a tie. I wore a red belt to match my red shoes,and I undid the bow to make it just a knot . Otherwise it would be too much going on on waistline.The left shoulder strap doesn't stay on the shoulder. It was made that way, not to stay on, but to be off the shoulder. It gives romance and elegance to the dress.It's thick enough not to give out your undergarments. I'd still wear a shapewear with it, just because I wear it all the time with any dress.Highly recommend! Totally worth your money!",

The style looks nice, and though the dress is somewhat bodycon, it's not like a second skin that shows every unflattering lump. I really like it, and can't wait to wear it out! A bonus of it is that, to me, it can be paired with a cardigan or businessy jacket and double as professional wear.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this in a medium in navy blue. The color is lovely and the style has a lot of potential. I really like the ruching and tie at the waist with peplum style over tummy area. This is a smart move cause it is a little forgiving to the figure for a body con dress style. The length (I'm only 5'3\") is long midi on me - but would look fine with heels. What I didn't like is the fit at the shoulders. It was definitely too big for me and just hit at a really weird and (for me) unflattering point on my body. If I actually took my arm out and tucked it under my arm to create a one shoulder look - it looked much nicer but would require a seamstress to modify. For some - this might be a 5 star dress - but for me - 4 stars and a return. Stylish - but proportions are off...might have been better if I ordered a small.",
