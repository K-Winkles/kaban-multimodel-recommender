This dress allowed me to wear heels and still was long enough, without that awkward above my ankles look. It was sexy but not overtly. I had so many compliments on this, and it is something I can wear again to other functions. Highly recommend as it is comfortable, as well as fashionable.",

Fabric is soft and stretchy and flowy.That said, I don\u2019t think the dress is for me. It doesnt do anything for me/my body. It has a scrunch in the back that helps tighten around the waist. I don\u2019t have much of a \u201cshape\u201d so this dress doesn\u2019t do much for my body. It is pretty full coverage and modest. Just not what I was going for. I feel like I look like a pilgrim, a stylish one at least. If this was the look i was going for, the dress would be perfect. Great length, very comfortable, stretchy, and cute.Fabric is thin though. Doesn\u2019t feel cheap but not luxurious either. It wasn\u2019t see through on me but it it was tighter it might be a little see through. The slit didn\u2019t feel like it was high enough, it was an awkward placement for me.A small fit me perfectly. I\u2019m 130 lbs, 5\u20194, and 34DD.",

The material is that of those maxi dresses that everyone was buying in 2016. Very stretchy and comfortable, but surprisingly warm. I am going to return it.
