It's comfortable and has a nice flow to it, it's not too short like a lot of dresses that sometimes don't account for the shape of bigger people, and I can tuck it into pants in various ways to make a comfortable top for different looks. A good, versatile basic dress that can be a closet staple.",

It sits at the bottom of my knees, not the top. (My height is 5\u20192\u201d.) I found a long knit cardigan to pair it with for modesty. The cardigan really dresses it up. I wore it to a dinner with a cardigan and belt. It has been a great base layer for outfits- even costumes and doubles as a warm slip. I\u2019ve turned it into a tank a couple times by tucking it and bundling the bottom. I would NOT wear this outside the house without a cardigan or shawl to cover me or a thick plain slip to wear underneath. I LOVE wearing it around the house though. So soft and comfortable and lightweight yet warm. The bottom has a swing feel when I moved around, too. I\u2019d buy again. Very versatile.",

I am 5'7 125-140 lb ( I fluctuate on scales but my usual size M and measurementsalways same ) bra size 36B . I am 36 /30/36 with height 5'7 measurements. Size M is absolutely perfect for me , length of dresses is perfect slightly below the knee. I love colores, washed them several times especially red one , it was my first. Washing in cold water on gentle/handwash cycle and flat dry. No color change or change in size or qoulaty of fabric. Dark green had little bit color bleed during first washing but I had it in prewash bucket because I made stain, bleed was minimal especially for 1st washing. They become my favorite dresses this summer for hot Arizona days. I wear them at home as well to go out to not very fancy. Wear assist is as well with belts-looks wounderful and fabric feels very nice on the skin. I probably will order even more in other colors they have. I wish they had more colors without print like true Yellow and orange. I got all my dresses on lightning deals so I don't payed full price nd it gives me extra satisfaction as well. Grate product for grate price. I think they would last for good time. And sizes is consistent in all 3 dresses.",

Given that I often buy a XX-Large, this is fine.I prefer black and dark jewel tones, which are available.The fabric is soft and not sheer or thin. Washing instructions are acceptable.",
