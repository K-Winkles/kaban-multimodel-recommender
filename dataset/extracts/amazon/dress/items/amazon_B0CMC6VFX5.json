Obviously, a bra will alter how it sits at the top, which will affect how it drapes downward. But, with the strapless bra, it looked great and made me feel confident in it!I can't wait until Summer time, when I plan on wearing this to local outdoor events. It's such a fun dress with the swishy tiers and bright color (I got the purple).",

This particular dress is a delight to put on-just pull over your head and fasten at the neck.It is comfortable.The elasticized smocking at the back allows for a good fit on a variety of body types and sizes.I am 5'3\" and it is about ankle length on me so will work with heels or flat sandals.The lilac color tiers remind me of flower petals. Because of that it seems like a perfect dress for spring.It is too chilly to wear right now but it will be perfect in April where I live. The design hides a lot of figure flaws and is so comfy and of course those combine to make me feel more confident. Confidence is beautiful!",

It's also comfortable to wear and easy to move in. I could see myself dancing the night away in this one.",
