It is a nice, heavy cotton that is not see-through yet flows nicely. I machine wash and dry, which makes these very easy care. My only complaint is that the waist seam (top of first tier) is right under the bust on me and I think it would look better and be more comfortable if it was a bit lower. Length is great, at 5\u20198\u201d after washing and drying the dress is just above my knee exactly as shown on model.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVED this dress but in the first warm-water washing and machine drying (medium permanent press) as directed it shrunk so much I had to give it to my sister-in-law. If it helps anyone to know TMI (\ud83d\ude02) I will say I'm a size 4-6 and ordered a medium (I often wear a small) because I have broad shoulders and am a 34DD. It fit perfectly until I washed and dried it. If you're not big chested it will likely be fine -- or don't dry it. I'm kind of heartbroken because I loved it so much, but don't want to spend the money on a replacement and turn a good value item into a relatively expensive one.",
