The only complaint I have is that I am 5'10\" and it feels a bit short on my frame. I would feel more comfortable wearing tights or leggings under this, but I live in a hot climate, so that doesn't work most of the year.",

I needed something to wear over leggings when we are going to Japan next week, having learned that leggings are considered like panty-hose and so should be covered. I have a few longer tops but thought this dress would be a good addition and it really is. Easy to dress up or down and while it will be great for wearing over my leggings, this will be a great dress to wear on its own, with black tights and boots or nice shoes. Sizing is very forgiving and I hope the black and grey ones are restocked in either large or medium because I'll be purchasing!",
