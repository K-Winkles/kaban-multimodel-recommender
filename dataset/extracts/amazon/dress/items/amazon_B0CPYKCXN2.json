                "reviewText": "What a pretty dress! I really like the material - it's thick and not at all see through. The fit is very much like the listing photos for me. The neckline is high enough you don't need an undershirt. It does look nursing friendly, but the cross part of the is sewn together, so unfortunately, it won't work for breastfeeding. The top is also probably best for a medium to large chested women. I'm smaller chested and it looks ok on me, but I think it would be more flattering on someone larger. The tie pictured on the back in the listings really could be worn either in the front or back - both look cute! The skirt is flowy but not unflattering and it is lined.. Best part - pockets!! I'm 5'3\" and the hem hits me slightly lower than the listing photo - a true midi length for sure. Overall, I look forward to wearing this in the spring and summer months (but could also wear it in the fall with a sweater and some boots!)",

                "reviewText": "I really like this dress and it's a very soft material. I honestly think the dress would be a bit more flattering on someone with a flatter chest, but it is still a graceful cut. I left mine in the dryer a bit too long, and the underskirt got wrinkled and bunched up, I had to hang the dress upside down from the underskirt to try and get it to unbunch, which worked pretty well. When I did wear the dress, I only had to adjust it occasionally, and I think if I had been faster to retrieve it from the dryer I could have avoided the issue entirely.I do think this is one of the materials that if you want it truly wrinkle-free, and you want the cuffs to look like they do on the model and the neckline to lay flat, you will have to iron it. Those cuffs and the neckline are subject to gravity, and without a hot press, they will fall however they'd like to after tumbling about in a dryer.",

I was impressed with the details, the skirt portion of the dress is lined to avoid showing more of your assets than you want. I love that it has nice sized pockets along each side. The waist is gathered elastic which gives you more of a defined waistline and there is a sash that you can tie in the front or back whichever you prefer. The orange red color is very pretty and I think would compliment any skin tone. The dress appears to be a linen blend so you may have to touch it up with an iron after washing. These pictures were taken after I washed it and hung it to dry, per the washing instructions. Overall the dress is very well made and is good quality.",

                "reviewText": "The dress is salmon pink, not red-orange as described and pictured. These badly Photoshopped, color-swapped images have got to stop. The dress is lined on the bottom, which is great. The top is sheer, so be prepared to have undergarments that match your skin tone. The v-neck hits in a strange and unflattering place, and it's sewn so together so unnecessarily securely that there's no taking out the stitches to replace with a button or snap. Pockets add weird bulk at the hips. Waist is just high enough to draw attention to any extra belly fat. I have other dresses from this maker that I really like, but this one is a huge disappointment. Maybe for another body type, but not great for a tallish woman with swerves and curves.",

                "reviewText": "Love this linen dress but it is layered and heavier fabric than expected. Will be great for Spring and Fall warmer weather but not HOT! Might be too heavy for Summer in warmer climates. I like that the V neck has stitching so that it is not a \"deep V\", but the stitch is a little high and falls at a weird place for my larger chest. Love that the connected band can either tie in the front or the back, and the length is a very nice tea-length.",
