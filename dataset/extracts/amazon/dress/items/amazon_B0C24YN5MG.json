                "reviewText": "I am not really sure what is going on with the sizing on this dress. The length is great for a modest look as well as the neckline, since this is a dress you can wear to match your daughter. The colors are also perfect for a fall or holiday style. Normally I wear an XXL, but I have also been losing weight and wanted to make sure this dress wouldn't be too tight, therefore I elected to stick with an XXL. The elastic back allows for getting the dress on overhead without issue, though I prefer a zipper back closure. The chest area is my biggest complaint as it is way too tight for someone with large breasts and did not allow for any natural curviture. The waistline was also awkwardly placed as I couldn't tell if it was meant to land at my waist or under the breast line since it landed about halfway between the two. The material is stiff which not only restricts the chest area, but makes it difficult to take off without assistance. I did like how the dress was flowy below the waist area. I do have a long torso, but considering the length of the dress, I can't confidently say this is sized for someone with a shorter torso. The material is thin but appears to be of good quality material.",

                "reviewText": "I got this dress to not only match my daughter but to wear while I teach and I love the print and pattern of it. I got a medium and I am in between a medium and a small with a larger bust. I felt like everything fits well except for around my neck. The square top came up a tad high which caused the straps to sag. I gave it 4 stars because I got this dress for $16.95 but the tag said $74.99. The quality of the fabric does not remind me of a $75 dress. The fabric will definitely need ironed or steamed after washing and wearing. Almost reminds me of a dress shirt fabric but more cotton-y feeling",

It has a stretchy panel in the back to help make it more fitted. The colors are very classic looking and go with a variety of accent colors. The skirt is a nice length and fullness.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little worried about sizing because the dress is cotton so I ordered one size larger. I do NOT think that was a mistake. I have some wiggle room but not as much as one whole size up. I also don\u2019t like tight clothes.I really like the pattern and color. However I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be noisy! The closest thing I can compare it to would be a cheap waterproof mattress protector (or a plastic bag). It\u2019s really strange and something you would think the manufacturer would have noticed!I think the cut is attractive as is the color choice. I just wish it wasn\u2019t so loud. It\u2019s really awkward and I won\u2019t wear it out of the house because of this.",
