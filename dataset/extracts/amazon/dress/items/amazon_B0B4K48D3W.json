                "reviewText": "This dress is so cute and decent quality. I got the white one for my bridal shower and it\u2019s way less see through than other dresses I had tried. It fit me nicely although when moving my arms forward it is a little tight, but not uncomfortable, so be warned if you have broader shoulders as I do. Still worth purchasing in my opinion as I have that problem often. But so excited to wear this to my shower and maybe even my rehearsal dinner in a couple months.",
