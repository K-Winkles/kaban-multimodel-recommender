A medium definitely wouldn\u2019t have buttoned shut. I\u2019m the mom of 4 and struggling with body image, so the fit, flow, and how on this dress is extremely flattering for concealing the belly area. I loved how classy it looked for my husbands fancy work Holiday dinner. Length is wonderful and appropriate and you can choose how much cleavage you want to show. Theres actual buttons all the way down.My only complaint is the definite need to size up and the bow came untied several times throughout the evening because of the silky material (which is otherwise lovely).",

Obviously comes wrinkled so will need to be steamed. I went by other reviews and and got my regular size Large. It fits nicely but I would have preferred an XL for a little more room to move and to achieve more of the look on the model. But I'm keeping the Large since I purchased it for family photos and another one wouldn't come in time. So I would say size up unless you want it to look more fitted than a little over sized and \"flowy\". For reference I am 175lbs, 33 inch waist and 38DD.Oh and the rouching and tie is great for hiding a tummy. I have a mommy pooch and \"apron\" belly and I feel very confident in this especially for photos!",
