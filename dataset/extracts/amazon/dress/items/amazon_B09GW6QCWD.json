It\u2019s \u201cfitted\u201d across the top, and flows down from there. It\u2019s mid-calf on me. It\u2019s lined through the bodice. It\u2019s not too hot in these Georgia summers. I ordered the sky blue shade 1st, and just ordered the navy blue. Love the pockets! I wash as directed: machine wash warm, (alone) and tumble dry low. I hang it up immediately and spray it lightly with Wrinkle Erase. It stays looking brand new. Also, not see-through! I totally disagree with any review that says that. It\u2019s lined, and the material is high quality. Looks like a boutique dress with a price you\u2019d put a \u201cone in front of.\u201dUpdate Note: July 2023, Ordered the Chartreuse in size Medium for a looser fit. The chartreuse shade is more muted than what is presented here. I love it! Not real bright, just very \u201ccool\u201d looking. Also, just ordered in Medium, the White! I love, love this dress! Again, put a \u201cone in front of the price\u201d\u2026that\u2019s what this beautiful, high quality dress looks like! I get compliments a lot, from other women, the best kind of compliment! PS:The size Small fits me very nicely; the size Medium looks great and is a little looser. :)",

They do fit true to size and the fit is a-line and slightly relaxed. I have a large chest and the chest area was not tight on me at all.",
