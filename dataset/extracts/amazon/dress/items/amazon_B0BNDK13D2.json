I wanted some comfy dresses in some bright colors for the upcoming Spring and Summer. These popped up in my search. I was not sure about these and the material, but after reading the reviews, I found my size and order 4 of them in different colors. I was either going to be set, or be disappointed. WELL, I AM DELIGHTED! These are so comfy and easy to wear. The colors are bright and fun. The fabric drapes well over my frame and is very flattering on my, still, plus frame. They are maxi length, but not too long, as others I have purchased, and I am 5'4\". After all of that, they have pockets!! This is a must have for me!! I am so happy and will order more, as this seller has a lot of colors!!",

The army green is more of a dusty sage, and the navy is so dark that it looks more like iridescent black ink and only looks navy in broad daylight. The length is more like a maxi than a midi for petite women, but even still the waist is about two inches higher than it appears on the taller model in the product images. Neither dress is unacceptable, though - the sleeves are long enough and fit closely enough that undergarments don't show with raised arms, and the pockets are well placed and a decent size. Pretty comfortable dresses. :)",

I'm on the taller side and these all hit in a funny place-too low for an empire waistline, too high for a natural waistline. I really, really wish they would make these dresses in Tall sizes or offer regular sizes with a dropped waist style. I alway end up with a tshirt dress with no waistline which ends up looking boxy and like pajamas. Please help us tall girls out! With that rant over, the dress overall would be exactly what you're expecting, color was nice and quality was as expected. Looked great right out of the bag and it had nice pockets.",
