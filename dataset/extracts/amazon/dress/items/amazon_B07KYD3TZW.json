This dress is perfect for dressing up and down and could be worn with a denim jacket for a casual look, or as a beautiful statement dress for a night out. It\u2019s super versatile.

So I took a really hot shower and had the dress right next to the shower but unable to get with and it helped get rid of the last few. I styled this with a cropped, long sleeve turtle neck for Christmas and it was great! So many compliments. Can\u2019t wait to wear this into spring and summer and style accordingly. Fits true to size!It\u2019s not too tight or too loose but somewhat slowly and non-constricting.Ordered size small & 5\u20195 140lbs for reference.",

I recommend some spanx under it. I might try another color in an XL. The straps are adjustable which is a great touch as well.",

I washed in cold and air dried per the instructions but there are still dark splotches everywhere. You\u2019d think I greased my whole body but alas I did not.If you buy this dress, just be sure to only lotion parts of your body that you are sure will not touch the dress.On a bright note, the sizing and fit were great and I wore my pre-pregnancy size small at 25 weeks and it did look cute on the bump.",

It\u2019s fitted in all the right spots in my opinion, it didn\u2019t come in on my gut but it accentuated my hips nicely! Great value for price!! I wore it with a cardigan to soften the look, but I loved styling it with my black fur coat and heels for a more classic, bold look!",
