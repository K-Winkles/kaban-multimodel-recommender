This dress fits the bill. It\u2019s made well and the fabric and lining is pretty decent. Not to mention I look amazing in it! Be sure to confirm your measurements. I ordered two of the same color\u2026 one large and the other an extra large. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d 150 lbs. The large fit but was just a little snug. The xl fits perfectly and is very comfortable with just enough stretch. I got the dark green to go with my daughters color theme and am looking forward to not only wearing it then, but will also be able to wear it at upcoming Christmas parties. Win win!",

I did wear shapewear under just to keep it smooth, but the dress is so perfectly stretchy - it holds where you need it and accentuates what you\u2019ve got. I am small-chested, so what you see in that photo needed the help of a padded bra to fill it out. Bonus for officiating - the two lapels were perfect for clipping microphones. Nowhere to hide the battery box, but we managed with them clipped to the back of my neck.",
