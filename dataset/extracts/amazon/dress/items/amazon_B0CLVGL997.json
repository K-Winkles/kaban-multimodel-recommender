I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d and 140 lbs and the medium fit well (glad I didn\u2019t go with small). I tried it on with a black shirt and boots. For me, I\u2019d prefer it to be a couple of inches longer to make it more age and work appropriate. However , I\u2019m keeping it for fun fall wear. Know that the fit is a lot like it looks in the model photo\u2014it\u2019s looser. It does not cling to curves.",
