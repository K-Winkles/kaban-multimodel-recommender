Initially I ordered the pink and white together and I am so glad I did because I could compare. I hated the pink and loved the white. Had I only ordered the pink one, I would've thought this dress was not for me. But the moment I put on the white one, I was shocked at how much I loved it, since I absolutely hated the pink one. So you just have to try different ones to really know. Size wise I'm usually a M rarely L in stores dresses, but mostly L in Amazon dresses. I got L and it is comfortably loose so that I don't have to use the zipper and just pull it over my head, but it's not too big on me. I use a skinny tan belt and tan sandals and it looks really good. I think if you have to use the zipper then you're in an incorrect size and need to size up.I also tried the blue stripe and it was much too narrow on me in the hips, so it runs a smaller than the other colors I have.",

I expected a heavier fabric. The dresses were very wrinkled, even after hanging for a few days. I received the yellow first and tried it on. It was a little snug below the elastic waist and clung in an odd way. After I received the blue one I almost didn't even try it on, but I did. It wasn't snug like the yellow one. I checked and both were size small. Although the blue one fit, it wasn't a good style on me.The part of the dress between the elastic waist and the tier seem at the bottom is basically straight rather than A -line, which I thought.The photos are not great, but you can see a bit of size difference between the two.For reference, I am 5'9\" and 125lbs",

Even though this dress did not come in petite sizes, I purchased it any way thinking I could return it if it was too long. I was pleasantly surprised that even though it was longer than midi for a petite frame, it wasn\u2019t maxi in length . It was comfortable and modest in style yet still definitely a summer dress. I am keeping it and plan to buy another one in one of the many prints available for this dress.",

The bad things about this dress: the top is too tight, it wrinkles easily, and the straps are not adjustable. I have now washed it, air dried it and was forced to iron it, but it still didn't fit the way I wanted (despite trying several bra options). For reference, I normally wear a size 8/36C and the Medium was smashing across the front. It had potential for a great dress, but it was not made for me.",
