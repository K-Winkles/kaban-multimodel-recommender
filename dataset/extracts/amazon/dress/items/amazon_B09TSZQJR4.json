However, I loved everything else about the dress that I still wore it on our dinner riverboat cruise in Savannah! It has enough give to pull it down enough when it gets too high for my liking. I had a hard time finding a dress that was pretty, fit comfortably and flattered my body, but this was a winner!",

                "reviewText": "I bought the \u201cRust\u201d and immediately purchased the \u201cGinger\u201d afterward because it was on sale and I loved the first one so much. I paid $26 for one and $22 for the other, and even though I love them, I wouldn\u2019t pay more than $30 for another.The material is nice and soft linen-ish material. Unlined but not see-through. Has pockets, and the smocking at the top is very flattering. The dress hem hits at about the ankle, which is a perfect length for me.HOWEVER, and the reason I took off a star- It does not wash well. The first one I bought I machine washed in cold water and hung it to dry and it appears to have shrunken a bit. This may be because I still need to iron it because it got very wrinkly, but the skirt is much shorter now and hits at the wider part of my calf, which is less flattering on me. Ironing it may give some length back, but that seems like a lot. I\u2019m a little sad about that, but it might be okay. My husband put my second dress in the dryer after the first wash, and it is basically ruined. The stretchy smocked part shrunk up SO MUCH. The bottom of the bodice used to hit at my natural waistline (which looks great on my pear/hourglass-ish shape) , and after shrinking it hits right under my bust, which looks awful on me. It also made the top tier of the skirt shrink tight around my hips/butt, which looks just terrible on me. Oof, it\u2019s really bad. I\u2019m going to try to pass it down to my sister, who is smaller and shaped a little differently than me, but it\u2019s so heartbreaking.I plan to update the review with photos when I get a chance. I wish I had a picture from before I washed them though.",

The fabric is fairly soft, I like the pockets, and the fit is very good for me, although it\u2019s very long\u2014to my ankles (I am just under 5\u2019 tall). I like the look of it and the way it fits me. I also like the sleeves which are almost like cap sleeves but a little more ruffled.So why it this dress special? Because I bought an almost identical dress from a different seller, also in Amazon\u2014but that other one, which was less expensive, just looked frumpy on me\u2014the fabric was a bit like cheesecloth, the fit was too lose, it did not have pockets, and I just felt like a grandma in it. Although they look similar, THIS dress is so much nicer!I am happy with it!I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be. I hope that my review helped you!",

It fit well (I am a rather small woman) and was comfortable. But every time I put it on I felt like it wasn't really very flattering. At least, it was not my style. The shirred bodice was nice, but the floppy sleeves reminded me of a kid's pinafore and the skirt was rather large - like you bought this type of skirt for modesty. At first I just wore it at home, but even at home, I like to feel good in clothes, not just comfortable. There was nothing wrong with the dress, it just wasn't my style, so I gave it away. Maybe someone else will have better luck with it.",

                "reviewText": "Very sweet and feminine dress, immediately fell in love with it when trying it on. It has good size pockets and a keyhole at the back neckline that I didn\u2019t realize it had. The color is more powder blue than I realized when looking at it online, but it\u2019s a very pretty and soft color.My only (very very small) complaint is that for a shorter person, the dress does not hit at a midi length. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d on a *really* good day and this dress is more ankle length and than mid calf. Im pretty use to this happening and still think it looks cute, but be aware of this if looking for a true midi dress.I\u2019ll add a picture once the event I\u2019m wearing it for comes around.",

                "reviewText": "I wore this dress for my fall time baby shower. The apricot color was such a creamy, complimentary color and the fabric quality seems great. It came fairly wrinkled from being shipped but all the wrinkles came out in the wash and right out of the dryer, still a little warm I hung it up. I like that the dress has a fitted top, it helped accentuate the bump without making me look big all over. If I could change one thing, I would make the sleeves a bit longer. It don\u2019t think the dress sleeves flattered my arms and you can actually see a bit of my skin in the armpit in this particular picture. It\u2019s not enough to make me hate the dress by any means. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll wear it for more occasions, even when I\u2019m not pregnant!",
