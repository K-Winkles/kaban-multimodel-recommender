For reference, it's not red at all and the image color is accurate. This is a great dress for vacation and packs well, however, I find myself traveling in it more often than not. It looks put together, yet it's comfortable enough to move in when I'm stuck in a tiny airplane seat. The black is not sheer at all. I found the material of the brick red to be a little thinner, but not so much that I was unhappy with it.",

I first ordered my usual size then returned and sized up, and now I love that it is body skimming and that the waist band is just above the natural waist at the slimmest point. I love the length, too. I\u2019m 5\u20195, 111 lbs. As I saw in one of the photo reviews, this soft, comfortable fabric pills quickly. I bought this dress in gray so it shows less. I have worn it here on a work trip to Rome where it is currently 101 degrees and humid, and it\u2019s been a good choice to pack. People dress up here and I wore it to a casual after work hours meeting and it was perfect. The pilling is why I only gave this 3 stars. I actually ordered another one in brick red despite the pilling. Wash cold and air dry to slow that down.",
