                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I cannot say enough good things about this dress.... it is so comfortable and flattering!! I am 51 years old and wore it to my daughter's wedding. It was the perfect combination of dressy and casual for a summer wedding. To top it off, my 16 year old niece showed up in the same dress in a different color!I think it runs true to size. I am 5'9\" and weigh 174lbs. I have a D cup bust and the only place the for was questionable was there. I normally don't wear dresses that tie at the waist because I am apple shaped and short waisted, two things that don't bode well for that look, but this dress looked perfect on me!My one (and only one) complaintis with the little snap button in the cleavage area. While I love the idea of it, the execution leaves a little to be desired. If you have anything above a small C cup, then it doesn't really lay flat and you can see it (couldnt see it on my much thinner niece). I actually thought about removing it, but I wore the wrong bra and without it snapped you could see my bra. I'm going to figure out a different bra to wear in the future and see if I can remove it (seems like all you need to do is snip a few threads).All in all I think this is a fabulous dress and you should get it.",

This material has a good quality weight to it, in 90-100 degrees it wouldn't work well (for me)... That being said - I absolutely had to keep this dress because of how flattering it is! It's true to size (M) and has a seam to join the fabric of the tulip hem along the opposite side for added security (ie: won't flare up past the knee). The dress is comfortable and had me feeling good; I received many compliments when I wore it to work! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This fit exactly as hoped and expected. Very comfortable, Very Flattering! My sister liked it and tried it on as well - I ordered the medium. I am 5'6 and small busted(small Bcup). She is 5'2 and bustier(full Ccup). The length on me is as pictured on website. On her, the back hem hits right at top of her shoe at the heel. We both agreed that the snap at the cleavage is too high & not helpful or flattering. So, with some double-sided fashion tape we adjusted the closure (slightly down from the snap) and we both agreed that that tiny adjustment made a huge difference it how it looked and felt, with the biggest difference being on her shorter, bustier frame. No more gapping at all (but still modest coverage) and it just overall made the lines more flattering on her. Oh and the color - Swiss Dot Blue - was exactly as pictured and as hoped for. A very warm, flattering, dusty blue/gray color perfect for the outdoor Fall Wedding on my calendar.",

My only complaint about it is that it does not flow as well as the picture -I expected it to flow better with the \u201cslit\u201d but it def has a more mermaid fit with limited mobility with how it\u2019s sewed shut. It\u2019s very cute but it\u2019s def designed for smaller sizes and busts.",
