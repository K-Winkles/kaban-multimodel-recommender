It is so comfortable and I love the material. For the price you can't go wrong. It is winter here now and about 14 degrees outside so the slightly heavier material is very welcomed. Would I wear it as a dress- no. It would make me look like a bag lady. But a a really comfortable nightshirt it is the best. I would definitely buy it again.",

The fit is oversized, maybe too oversized, but the next size down would've clung to me in certain places and I much prefer a looser, baggier fit - order your regular size if you want it to be oversized, size down if you want it to be more fitted. The material is kind of thin. For the price, they're great and I ordered multiple colors. I recommend it.",

However, they definitely won\u2019t disguise any kind of line: bra, panty, belly, etc. The material is a soft jersey(?), light, & stretchy. I am on the shorter side but it has a good length \u2014 stops a bit above the knee w/ a little extra length in the back.Overall, I enjoy throwing this on w/ some bike shorts underneath (to hide the lines) and going about my day. Very easy to dress up a little too. I would not pay more than $20 though.",

It can totally be dressed up with some fun accessories or a jacket. The fabric is flowy, not clingy at all, it's a comfortable length too. I'm 5'7\" and I really like the length. It hits just above the knee, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be pulling it down or adjusting it all the time.I wore it all day on July 4th in 95 degree heat and it was cool and comfortable all day, at a picnic, watching fireworks, in and out of lawn chairs and on the ground with the kids. I would be great for travel too! I will definitely buy more!",

They're loose enough to pull out with your fingers if your nails are long enough, or even if your shirt happens to come in contact with a counter or something. But they're not loose enough for lint rollers for some reason, which has been really annoying, and I've been worried about them getting into food and such.As an example, this is a picture of one of these shirts I bought, and I bought THREE of these. This is the right shoulder. I too a closeup of it so you can see how numerous and tiny these fibers are, but it's not JUST the right shoulder that's like this, it's both shoulders and the collar area, as well as the back. For ALL THREE. I've never owned a shirt that's done this EVER and most of my closet is black. I almost wanna say it's the elastic fibers breaking, but it's not like I've never bought anything like that before, so ??????",
