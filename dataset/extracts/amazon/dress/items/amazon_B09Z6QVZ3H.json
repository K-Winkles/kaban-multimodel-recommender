                "reviewText": "So when I looked into this dress I thought it was super cute. It has a nice design and the fit is adorable. I measured myself and went by the measurements provided plus some of the reviews. It was actually for my graduation party last year which is why I was so excited and nervous about getting it. When it came in the mail I opened it up and tried it on. It doesn\u2019t actually fit how I wanted it to. The bodice part was loose and since it was loose, it was all itchy inside because of the texture. I tried washing it in the hopes it would shrink but I didn\u2019t think about how that also meant I couldn\u2019t return it. So now I\u2019m stuck with a dress I thought was good until I actually got it :(",

Other reviewers found it to wrinkle easily but I didn't have that problem. I just spray it with water and let it hang overnight to release some of the wrinkles (the pink picture is before spraying with water, the green dress is after spraying and wearing for several hours). I think if the dress is ironed then it will look wrinkled. But I think it isn't supposed to look flat. I haven't washed it yet so maybe it comes out really wrinkled? Time will tell. But I think the dress is great! I'm 5'5, 170lbs, 38C.",
