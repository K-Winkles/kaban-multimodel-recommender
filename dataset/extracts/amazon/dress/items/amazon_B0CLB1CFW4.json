My closet is filled with Grace Karin designs, as they fit great and are classic in style, so you know you will be able to get much wear out of them.This dress is no different. I love the side detail that gives a ruched look in the stomach area, helping to hide any problem areas. The halter neck design is so flattering to the shoulder and bust areas.The fabric is soft and somewhat thin, but yet not at all inexpensive looking. It will make for the perfect summer dinner dress, or to simply slip over a swimsuit for a more casual beach day. As it\u2019s currently winter, I have worn this dress topped with a blazer and it looks just as great, making it a wonderful year-round piece.I am 5\u20197 and the dress fits true-to-size, definitely falling into the \u201cmidi\u201d dress category, ending just past my knees.A lovely, feminine dress for any occasion!",

This dress is, somehow, sexy and casual at the same time! I can't wait for the weather to warm up to wear this out as a casual day dress and still feel sexy as the night goes on! The fit is very nice, I wear anything from XS to Small so I was nervous the small could be too large. Although slightly loose, the dress's ruched center makes it look almost purposeful. The rose red color is exactly as pictured and looks very nice.",

                "reviewText": "The style of this dream is super flattering on just about any figure. The ruching always helps flatter curves and minimize any flaws or poochie bits (as I call them.) The material is soft and feels comfortable. I was a bit challenged getting it on, probably just me, but it was weird trying to get the halter on with my head and arms going through in the right position. I got the Navy and it's a classic for just about any event and goes easily from day to night activities. True-to-size. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Love this dress in rose red. This will be perfect for any wedding/work event/party during the summer. I got the rose red color to break the monotony of my standard choice of black and I am glad I did because it looks fantastic. I ordered a Medium and am 5'4 and weigh 140lbs. The dress isn't super tight but fits nicely. The semi runched mid section helps to disguise any belly imperfections. If you are around my size and want a tighter fit you could make a small work as well due to this dress having some stretch to it. There is a hidden zippered closure on the side seam of the dress, that works as it should, not sticky. Love the neckline (forgive my exposed bra straps), you will definitely need a strapless bra for this dress. I have purchased multiple dresses and clothing pieces from Grace Karin and I've kept all of them due to the cuteness and quality. Hope this helps anyone that is searching for a good quality dress at a very reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this dress in black and am very pleased with it. The fabric feels like a soft t-shirt, but it fits like a fancy cocktail dress. It would *feel* completely reasonable to toss this on as a beach cover up, but it looks like you're ready for a nice night on the town. It's extremely flattering, with the high neckline and exposed shoulders giving it a classic, classy silhouette. The ruching at the waist hides imperfections while still enunciating curves. The dress might be a little long for some--it hits me just below the knee but I am 5'9\". Overall this is a great dress, but it somewhat straddles the line between casual and dressy, because of the juxtaposition of the cut and the fabric.",

The knit material makes it easy to slip on hassle-free and comfortably, with a forgiving stretch. The halter neckline adds a touch of elegance, while the side slit makes this dress incredibly sexy. Any time I see a criss-cross neckline like this, it reminds me of Demi Moore's black dress in the move \"Indecent Proposal.\" I got the navy one which keeps this style looking classic and versatile for formal occasions as well as casual nights out without screaming like you are looking for attention.",

The slit starts at just the right height (around my knee), and the design is perfect for cocktail attire.",
