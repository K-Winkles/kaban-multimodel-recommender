                "reviewText": "Update: 8/22/22 Excited to see new colors, patterns so bought 5 more. Gross 1970\u2019s Polyester (they\u2019re calling it biscose AKA viscose allows them to forget how terrible, hot, thick nylon/rayon, this buy-one, get-ten free dress is) A million miles away from the snuggle-soft fabric of original tank dresses are. I have about 9 of those.I am disappointed in the feel and fit. So sad.04/09/2021XL Bra size: 42cThis dress is adorable but I returned for an XL bc I don\u2019t like clingy (tacky) clothing that exceeds the bounds of decency. I wanted room to stay cool in the warm summer months. I also ordered 4 other colors as these will be my go-to dresses for the summer & fall when I\u2019ll add a cute sweater, cropped jacket or jean jacket.This dress hit me right below the ankle which is acceptable. Has just the amount of stretch to look smooth and polished while complimenting your figureThis dress will take you from season to season in style while you wait for the compliments to roll in.When you wear this dress, you will not only look cute, you know you are cute \ud83d\ude0a.UPDATE: 4/16/21 Back to buy 7 more colors!I got an XL originally and was disappointed to see all the other patterns were out of stock-YIKES!I decided this fabric wears great and I could manage nicely even going down a size especially since I\u2019m loosing weight.This fabric is amazing, moves with you & is very forgiving but continues to flatter. Wear for beach coverup, around the house, add a cute pump, bolero or cropped sweater/jacket and you\u2019re ready for date night and yes, it\u2019s soft & comfortable enough to sleep in.You owe it to yourself to get this stylish dress that has endless possibilities.UPDATE: 04/17/21Black, olive, burgundy & black/white arrived today.Olive smells faintly like chemicals. I will hang it on my balcony in the sun which should resolve that issue.As I\u2019d hoped, sizing down to L was just fine as there was so much give in the fabric. I believe the striped patterns are more flattering and fabric is softer and has even more give than the solid colors.The solid colors are also SHORTER in length by nearly 2\u201d than striped patterns and even though I\u2019m 5\u201d9 it\u2019s not a dealbreaker.This silhouette is great!Happy with purchase. Think I\u2019ll go ahead and get the printed patterns as well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought one in black and one in sage green.I am 5\u2019 8\u201d, 125 lbs.For the price this dress is excellent. I prefer my black tank dresses with no side split so it doesn\u2019t blow everywhere in the breeze.But this dress is made from that bouncy rayon mix that tends to cling and shows every bra and panty line or buldge so proper undergarments are a must.PROS: nice fabric, fitted but not too much. Nice narrow sillouhette.Arm holes and neckline are not too revealingFor us in our 50\u2019s but not severeLength: mine hits just at the ankle and I am tall so I love it. I can belt it and scrunch it up or wear it long.Comfort/fabric: excellent. Quite sheer so good for layering and not too hot but lighter colors will be see through in sunlight.CONS:As with much of today\u2019s \u201cdisposable\u201d clothing you get what you pay for. Viscose=rayon so it will shrink/lose its shape if put in dryer. Touch of spandex gives it shape so that\u2019s nice.Quite sheer: I ordered the sage green and had to return as it showed EVERY line, bra buldge, etc. so beware.Overall excellent dress. Very versatile. Good for warm weather and travel.",

                "reviewText": "Deep Wine Red XLThe review below this is what I wrote for this dress in the leopard print in size large, I don't want to erase it, so I am adding the review for the wine red dress in size XL above it. It is the same rather thin fabric. But I have determined it is good in hot weather. Between the larger size and very dark colour, the wine red dress is totally opaque. (I felt the lighter coloured leopard print had a potentiel to show my bra, depending on the colour, especially if it was any tighter over the chest. It didn't, though.)Regarding the colour, please note that it is more burgundy than red, cool and deep, almost shading into aubergine. It's all right on me because I am a former brunette (my hair is now naturally grey), but the colour might be a bit dark and heavy on a blonde or redhead. Of course, it depends on your taste, but I thought the colour looked much lighter and redder in the pictures than it does in real life.I really think L was my size, but I do appreciate the additional looseness in the hips and waist areas afforded by the XL, as well as the additional length. I am 5'10\", and the L is an above-the-ankle dress, when the XL is ankle length, in flats, which is how I will mostly wear them. The top part is quite loose. The arm holes are deep and loose and the bust is loose as well. I have broad shoulders, a very large rib cage and a medium-sized bosom (C cup), plus biggish arms (think middle-aged swimmer), so it is unusual for me to find clothes are too big on top. I think you should bear that in mind for sizing. If, like me, you want the dress to be non-clingy around the waist and stomach, it may be challenging to get a good fit unless you have a very full chest. Indeed, I think I will try this with a padded bra next time.The price point is sort of middle-of-the-road and so are the dresses. I think they will hold up well; others I had in this brand did and I have washed and worn the leopard dress maybe four times now and the wine one once with no noticeable changes whatsoever. They are not thrilling dresses, but they are serviceable and handy, especially in a hot climate (and I live in Africa). They could have been better, and I am surprised by the fit, but overall, I am happy with my purchases and will wear them often. I like that the skirt is a bit wider on the bottom and doesn't have a slit. It is easy to walk in (I have a long stride and can't stand a skirt that hobbles my gait), and the fact it doesn't have a slit means I don't have to worry about a slip showing underneath.Leopard Print LThis dress is one I am going to keep, but I think I will mostly wear it under a jean jacket. This dress has several minor issues. The material is thinner and more polyester-like than expected. It is not see-through, however, despite the light-coloured base. The beige shade is deeper and warmer than expected, which may be nice for some, but is not very good for me (I have grey hair and was expecting more of an ecru, it's almost a tan). Above all, it is clingy without being tight. The material just sticks to any lumps or bumps. I could literally see the outline of the elastic on my panties. Not an indent, because they're not tight, but the actual top and bottom of the elastic. And it pointed out the little pooch and the little pouch in my midsection. Thankfully the skirt is a little looser, it's an A-line style, so I didn't see anything on my lower hips. I admit I haven't tried it with a slip and might play around with different underwear options. If I were a Spanx wearer, it would be lovely, but I don't do that... if I can find a cool shift to put underneath, it might smooth things out. We'll see...Update a week later: This dress is growing on me. The colour is all right. The thin fabric makes it cooler in this stifling heat. I haven't found a shift, but I've worn a half slip. You can see the little line around my waist, but it's not the end of the world, as you can see, I'm obviously not going to be on any catwalks any time soon. Great dress for wearing around the house, and will probably look cute under my jean jacket in cooler weather.Further update: tried it with loose tap pants and it was all the dress needed for modesty and very cool and comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this, knowing it might be a bit big for me, which it was. Still, I debated for a few days before returning it, thinking that -- especially at that price, which was low -- it might be worth it to try to alter it to fit me. Ultimately, I did return it and got my refund very rapidly. It would have been very comfortable, pleasantly stretchy and not too see-through, but light enough for summer wear. The vivid orange and black pattern was very appealing. I very much appreciated the speed with which I received the dress as well as my refund.",
