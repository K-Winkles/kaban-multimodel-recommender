The cut is done so well, it accentuates my curves, and I feel very pretty wearing it!I like both colors equally. It\u2019s sewn extremely well, the fabric is stretchy and thick. It moves with you. It\u2019s not see-through. Perfect for just about any occasion I can think of.Machine wash, hang to dry, and super affordable. It\u2019s absolutely the perfect dress! Hope you love yours, just as much!",

                "reviewText": "The dress did not disappoint. I was disappointed in myself though when I put it on. I purchased the Amazon recommended size and it fit great everywhere, except the stomach area which made me feel a little too self conscious. I've gained a few pounds around the middle, so I prefer not to wear it right now until I lose some tummy fat. I'm keeping the dress as I know one day this dress is going to look amazing on me.The material has a little stretch without be too confining or clingy. I'm 5' 0\" and a size small fit perfectly (except my stomach). Being a short girl, finding a perfect dress length is hard to do since tea-length dresses typically hit mid-calf on me and just look weird. This dress length was perfect for my short, girl body. I felt like a 1950's Betty White while wearing it (if you know what that style looks like).The material was great quality so that is another reason I plan to keep it until I can fit into it again.",
