                "reviewText": "I purchased the pink tweed using the manufacturer size chart. I always buy based on bust measurements because that\u2019s the hardest point for me to get things to fit properly. This dress was spot on! Use the size chart included in the photos! While I hate that the size charts from China always make me feel like I am a bloated toad I do buy based on measurements and ignore the size. I advise buyers to put aside vanity and do the same for the perfect fit.This dress is very pretty on and gives classic Chanel vibes. I paired it with some shoes that I found also on Amazon that were Chanel dupes and it was an amazing outfit.The dress is extremely comfortable. However it is unlined. It would look more expensive if it had lining! For those who aren\u2019t used to wearing old school slips, buy one. The dress will look much more expensive when it is gliding over you vs. sticking to your skin. I did that and it truly looked so beautiful.The neckline is very unique. I loved it but did have to adjust my bra so it did not peek out on the lower corners. It wasn\u2019t a big deal but just be aware that you may encounter this.In terms of the fabric\u2014 I would agree with other reviewers here. This is a loose tweed. I don\u2019t know how this would hold up for everyday wear. I could see this pulling and snagging easily. But then again there are sweater dresses and people buy them so there\u2019s that. For my purposes it works great.This is the kind of dress that is a time capsule dress. It\u2019s a classic. You can dress it down with a cardigan or crew neck sweater and a pair of flats, or dress it up with a blazer and pumps.It terms of it being a scratchy fabric, I disagree. So many fabrics these days are slippery sports type poly or nylon or Lycra. I deplore them. If that\u2019s what you are expecting then you won\u2019t like this fabric. Tweed has more of a wool or cotton/linen feel which by its very nature is heavier and less soft than something like a yoga pant or legging. Tweed is also a woven fabric vs a knitted fabric so there is a texture difference. I found the dress to be comfortable which says something since I have a nerve disease that makes scratchy fabrics literally painful to wear. But I wore appropriate undergarments so that could be the difference as to why I didn\u2019t find the fabric bothersome.Would I recommend? Yes.Do I wish it was lined? Yes.Is it comfortable? Yes.Do I think it will hold up over time? Questionable and only time will tell.Am I pleased with my purchase? Yes.Would I buy again? Yes.Update: I bought a second dress, black (plaid). Again I followed the size chart included in the photos. Just as with the first purchase, this second dress was a perfect fit for me. The more I have worn the first dress, the more I love it. It is so comfortable! I suspect I may be back for another (third) dress maybe in green or blue. Two of my friends liked it so much they have ordered for themselves.I will say this is a beautiful cut, and also emphasize that I wish it was lightly lined in the skirt. It looks incredible on!",

I read the reviews and thought I should upsize but that was a mistake, so I guess I would say it fits true to size. I wore it anyway even though it was big. I washed it and it washes up nicely. Now I will add it to my Poshmark store. :)",
