I wish an XS was offered though. It's a bit too loose/baggy on me, not as figure skimming as the product photos. I'll probably wear with a belt to cinch it in a bit more. I'm a shortie, it hits me at the bottom of my kneecap, so I'll have to take a few inches off the bottom to be just above the knee, but that'll be easy. I wouldn't characterize this as a mini-length for a normal sized woman though, maybe if you're a really tall woman with long legs. The dark green is super dark, a bit darker than the product photos, but it's still nice and I'll still wear it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm plus sized (XL) and have the typical c-section tummy so I find it difficult to find clothing that looks nice on my body. Dresses are always too tight on my belly or some weird length. This dress is perfect. The color is really pretty, the length is exactly where I like dresses to fall, it is tight at the top and loose and flowy everywhere else, AND it has pockets! Actual functional pocket you can use. Not \"pockets\". It's also super comfortable, soft, and stretchy. I love this dress and would genuinely buy it in every color. I've worn it by itself and with leggings underneath and a cardigan it looks super cute no matter how you style it. Legit closet staple.",

I would have preferred the waist to be a tad lower than it is.If you are one of those busty mid sized gals that strays away from rounded necklines\u2026avoid this one as well. It is *ok*, I will be wearing it with a long necklace and pairing it with a jacket and cardy.The fabric is lovely, soft. The color is a beautiful jade green. Pleased with the construction of said garment. It even has pockets!!",
