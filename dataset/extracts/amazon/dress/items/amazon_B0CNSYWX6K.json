                "reviewText": "I ordered this ANRABESS Women's 2024 Summer Casual Flutter Short Sleeve V Neck Smocked Elastic Waist Tiered Dress because I was looking for an easy-to-wear dress that could span seasons, dress up and down, and was comfortable to wear.I\u2019ve been dealing with some chronic health and chronic pain problems recently and struggling with loss of mobility. I\u2019m still fairly young, but I just can\u2019t do as much physically as I was able to even a few years ago. I\u2019ve been learning new ways to use the energy I do have, and one of the things I\u2019ve learned is that life is too short for uncomfortable clothes.This dress looked like what I\u2019d been searching for. It is easy to pull on, easy to wear. The smocked bodice is flattering and forgiving to many body types. The dress looks fine by itself, or over leggings in the wintertime, like now.I ordered the dress in Wine Red. This is a deep, dark red with a slight blueish undertone. Despite the name, it is a clear red, not edging towards brown or yellowish undertones.The dress is made of a heavyish polyester blend. There\u2019s a fair amount of spandex in the mix, because the dress is quite stretchy, especially in the bodice, which is shirred.I don\u2019t usually wear polyester, I prefer cotton and other natural fibers. This dress has a nice hand feel, and I like how stretchy it is. A few years ago, they were calling these smocked-bodice dresses \u201cnap dresses\u201d, and you could definitely grab a nap in this dress. My office is in our basement (I write fairy tale fantasy under several pen names) and I\u2019ve been planning to put a small chaise or sofa in my office so when I get exhausted writing, I can lie down for a while until I catch a second wind. This dress is perfect for a working day like that\u2014easy to get dressed, easy to wear, looks much nicer than leggings and a tee, and I can catch a quick nap if I need to, before going back to edit the morning\u2019s work.I can\u2019t stress enough how versatile this dress is. I\u2019m always looking for a dress that\u2019s really versatile\u2014you can dress it up or down\u2014and this was just what I wanted. It takes about two seconds to throw this dress over my head, even as slow as I am these days. One step shopping\u2014poof! All done. Better than a fairy godmother.But the dress doesn\u2019t look like you got dressed in two seconds. This dress is well-designed. The smocked bodice is slightly textured, which covers all kinds of figure flaws. I\u2019m small\u2014a bit under 5\u20193\u201d. I wear a six on the bottom and a M on top, unless it\u2019s a bottom-down shirt, where I size up so I don\u2019t have gaps between the buttons. I\u2019m curvy, especially on top. This dress skims the curves, not too tightly, and shows my little waist.I did size up to the L because I wanted to be sure the bodice covered my whole torso area, and it fit well, a little loose in the waist and hips, which worked for me because it looked modest and felt comfortable.The sleeves are small, like short flutters. The skirt is long, hitting me around the ankles. The skirt is made of three tiers. I was very happy to discover the dress has two good-sized pockets. I wear an insulin pump and CGM, so the pockets are really helpful.This sort of vintage design, modest and stylish, is flattering to so many figure types. The stretchy smocking in the bodice and the long, slim skirt of tiers are feminine and curvy. Best of all, the dress is flattering as well as being comfortable to wear.This design lends itself to being dressed up and down. Right now, in the wintertime, I\u2019m wearing the dress for a day of writing in my office. I\u2019m dressing the outfit down with a long cardi for extra warmth, and my down booties to keep my feet warm. But it also looks great dressed up a bit, with my black riding boots and a grey flannel jacket that is nipped at the waist. I can dress it up even more, with heels and jewelry, for a night out.This will work well in spring, too, where I can swap my winter cashmere cardigan for a cotton one, and my booties for slip on sneakers. The dress looks great with tights or leggings, or all by itself. It may be a bit warm for summer, but it\u2019s probably okay in the AC.I\u2019m definitely thinking about going back and ordering another one in black. They have patterned floral dresses, too.It can be hard to be a \u201cspoonie\u201d dealing with chronic health and pain issues. But finding a way to dress that helps me feel and look comfortable helps a lot. The lines of this dress are flattering, and it really is comfortable enough to take a nap in\u2026 or at least, to lie down for a few minutes and rest.Makeover shows love to show the \u201chero\u201d dress that can be dressed up or down to go everywhere. This really is one of those dresses\u2014and it is so comfortable to wear. If you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like when your own clothes hurt when you wear them, I hope you never have to understand the experience. And if you do understand, let me recommend this dress! It looks so much nicer than your old pajamas, but it feels great when you put it on.This is a nice bargain at this price. Lots of value, lots of design, for not that much money.Smocked-bodice dress is stretchy, flatters many figures, including curvy girls. Long, slimmish-cut skirt has three tiers and pockets. This dress can be dressed up or down, and is comfortable enough to take a nap in.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second dress I have ordered from ANRABESS. The first one (different style) for myself, and this one for my daughter. I find that both dresses are on the smaller end of their size. Mine is a medium--while it does fit just not quite the same as most of my mediums--slightly smaller. The same with the dress for my daughter--she is usually an extra small or small. Since this dress did not come in an extra small, we ordered the small, and it works well being slightly smaller than the usual small. The smocking on the top is great--keeps the dress fitting well and not gapping when you lean over. Over all the dress is soft and comfortable but you do notice a slight pressure from the elastic for the smocking--not uncomfortable but a slight pressure. Arm holes with flutter sleeves are not too loose--again the smocking helps this to fit well around the arm holes. Ordered in navy blue and color is as pictured. This is a casual feminine style dress that is well made--I think it will be great in the summer heat or with a sweater/jacket on cool spring days!",

                "reviewText": "This dress is casual and comfortable and will be perfect for the coming summer weather. Personally, I think this dress is nice enough to be worn on some dressier occasions, such as summer parties, showers, or even an outdoor wedding.The fit of this dress is very flattering, due in part to the tiered elastic waist. The neckline is just right. It's not cut too low, which is a problem I sometimes have with other maxi dresses. The flutter sleeves give the dress a very delicate feel. They can be worn on or off the shoulder. The skirt of the dress is very flowy and feminine. The dress also has pockets on both sides, but they lay flat and don't ruin the lines of the dress.The dress fits true to size. I am 5'8\" and 133 lbs. I ordered a small, my usual size, and it fits perfectly.",

It is so pretty on the model, and I actually wondered if it would look too young on me\u2014mainly because of the flutter sleeves\u2026 and because of my age (being a grandmother in her 60\u2019s). After trying it on, I was pleasantly surprised! It fits well (size Large) and is very flattering on me. I don\u2019t have a large frame (which helps), but I am not slender, either.The fabric is so soft and flowing, and the dress is made well. The pockets are a nice addition to the dress and are hidden by the print. This dress will be appropriate for either lounging around the house or wearing on a warm evening out with my husband. I love this dress, and I highly recommend it!",

The dress is extremely flattering. I am bigger than I have ever been, but I felt normal in the dress. I am 14 weeks pregnant too and I didn't feel like my belly was showing that at all with this cut. I am 5'7\" and it hits about mid-calf on me. The sleeves dip back a bit so a specific bra is needed and it may be strapless. It's so comfortable that I am very much looking forward to wearing it again.",
