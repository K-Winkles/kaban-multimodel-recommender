                "reviewText": "I was so looking forward to this dress and the sizing chart for the 2XL was spot on. That being said the models showing the dress have the waist line at the waist with the belt nicely draped. The dress has a cowl neck, a belt, two pockets, a skirt lining that hits mid thigh (18 1/2\" from waist to hem), two side slits and a back button closure. The skirt flows beautifully and the lining allows the skirt fabric to skim your curves. The top of the dress, for me, does not fit well. The measurement is 16 1/2\" from the shoulder seam to the elastic waist, I need 20 to 21\" so the waist sits at an odd location. The waist is 47\" fully stretched which would be great if it hit my waist. The cowl does not drape correctly to accomodate a bustier lady, it probably is using the same drape measurement for a smaller dress size. The Bustline measures 48\" from armhole to armhole. The armholes are a full 20\" around which are too large for most women and will show your foundation garments. The dress measures a full 55\" from neck to bottom hem and there are two slits on either sides that measure 16\" from bottom hem. The description mentions a high waist but the pictures of the dress on the model to not support that. I actually love the fit and flow of the skirt and I will get a new top and replace what is there now.",

Black is the perfect color for this midi dress (hangs to the calf).Was eager to try this item on for size and wear it out on a date with hubs! Sadly this was not to be as the dress has no stretch whatsoever (except for the waist band) and will not go over my bust area. Had I tried an XXL it would more than likely have fit but this is an XL. (For reference I am somewhere between a USA size 16 to 18 so I can usually wear either of those sizes.)That being said every inch of the stress is beautiful. The waistline and hemline are flattering. The drop neck styling on this dress is well proportioned and can be left as it lies or paired with a beautiful choker necklace....even pearls perhaps. Cap sleeves are also attractive. To be noted also is the hem slits on either side of the legs for room to move....even dance!",

The neck is odd to, I feel like it should be bigger and more off the shoulder to be flattering, but once you button it, it's odd looking. The slip is also a bugger to get right and I wore it around the house before even realizing that there was a built in slip.If you are petite, I think it would work but for fuller women, its a no go.",

                "reviewText": "This dress is really pretty and the light blue color is perfect. I have a few clothing items from Grace Karin and honestly have never been disappointed, especially at the reasonable price point. This dress has a comfortable lining that goes to mid thigh and allows the satin material to lay nicely. It is lightweight and perfect for warm days. I am deducting one star because it wrinkles easily and the delicate wash/dry maintenance. It definitely needs to be ironed but I would do so cautiously on a low heat and inside out. The other issue for me is the elastic waistband hits me in a weird place. It hits slightly above my natural waistline. I am long waisted so that is not uncommon but worth mentioning. Overall it is a nice versatile dress.",
