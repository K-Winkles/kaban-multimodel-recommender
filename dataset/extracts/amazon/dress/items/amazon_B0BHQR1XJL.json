                "reviewText": "This review will be similar to another review I read here, because it was completely on point.Pros: I was pleasantly surprised how well this fit and how cute it was. I attended a wedding and received many compliments on the dress. I like how the sleeves cover my arms, but are sheer, so it's cool enough for spring/ fall. The cut was perfect to cover my chubby mom tummy, but still very classy and flattering. Material is very light and flowy. I feel very comfortable in this.Cons: The dress is pretty short. I'm only 5'4\" (170lb). I got the size Large, and you can see it's still pretty short on me. Wearing this outside, the wind caught the fabric a few times and I def had several \"Marilyn Monroe\" moments... I'm sure I revealed more than anyone wanted to see that night. The snap on the cleavage area worked for me (I'm a 38C), but it was pretty cheap... felt if I moved the wrong way that it could bust open at any moment and also reveal more than I'd like. So maybe a safety pin would be more secure.Overall, I tried on like 30 dresses from Amazon... this was the clear winner, and I'd definitely wear this again! (Maybe on a non- windy day to an indoor event lol)Ps... don't mind the dusty mirror, but wanted to show how this dress looked.",

This arrived on time in a small package which means slightly wrinkled. Due to the thin material I didn\u2019t want to iron it. I put on the dryer for a few minutes which got out a lot of the wrinkles making it wearable.I thought it was pretty and knee length ( I\u2019m 5 ft 2) which is what I wanted. But as usual with. Amazon dresses, the waist is higher than where your waistline is. Also whenever I raised my arm up the top part of the dress would also raise up.So I just didn\u2019t raise my arm - problem solved. Birthday dinner was lovely. Dress cute. But probably wouldn\u2019t wear again. I like comfortable proper fit",
