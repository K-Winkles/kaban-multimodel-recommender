My only concern with it is that the wrap part of the front slit goes all the way up. My personal fashion preference is to have nothing above my mid thigh showing and for work (in the business side of healthcare) I don\u2019t go above the knee. I wore this to a gala for work and was uncomfortable sitting due to the slit going so high. So it\u2019s super pretty and I like the dress but be mindful of where you intend to wear it!",

Those hide chunky bits well too. Grabbed me a pair of strappy heals and off I went. Did my hair look fabulous? No, but you take what you can get. For $30ish bucks, not a bad dress.",
