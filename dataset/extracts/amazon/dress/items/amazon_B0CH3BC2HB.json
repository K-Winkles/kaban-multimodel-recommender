As a fan of Anrabess, I appreciate the stylish design and quality of their pieces. The only downside is that it doesn't come with shorts underneath, which would have been a great addition. Nevertheless, I'm excited to wear this dress during the summer \u2013 it's a chic choice for any warm-weather occasion.",

                "reviewText": "Finding the right summer dress can feel like a treasure hunt, but this one is a pretty decent find. When it comes to style meets comfort, this number had me at 'summer sleeveless'. The fabric is soft and welcoming, almost like a gentle hug on a hot day. And with its double lining, I commend the discreet nod to quality and modesty it provides.But alas, not all is perfect. The neckline, oh so squarely cut, presents a bit of a conundrum. As much as I love the uniqueness it tries to bring, it dips too low, making it a game of hide and seek with a normal bra. Thankfully, my strapless bra stepped up to the challenge, becoming the unlikely hero of my wardrobe once more.What I appreciate, though, is the slim fit design that contours gracefully, complementing the active, on-the-go lifestyle that my family and I embody. Be it a quick roundabout with the kids in the garden or a spontaneous trip to the local market, this dress seems to keep up.And so, it hangs proudly in my closet, a testament to versatility with a hint of rebellion against conventional necklines. Whether it's for a breezy day out or a light workout session (certainly not one including somersaults unless pairing with shorts), this dress is game - just be sure to have a strapless bra on standby.",

                "reviewText": "I've rolled dice on a number of tennis dresses trying to find that perfect fit. Sometimes they are tight (preferable) with two layers, one to compress my body, and the other to conceal that hot mess in the first layer. Sometimes they're thin, and reveal everything.I was very surprised with this dress. It is tight and has two layers, and my silhouette looks great in it. It's got a slight A-line to it which goes on to conceal my hip dents without being bodycon all the way down.I don't like that there is no attached short, no detachable short, no anything to close it up from the bottom. This is a mini dress, so be sure to wear underwear or modesty shorts if you're planning to run around and fall on your face or back. I also am not super jazzed about the appearance of the square neck. It's just not as flattering as maybe a V would have been, but this I can't hold against the maker as it's clear this is what it was when I ordered. It just doesn't look as great in person.It's a really flattering mini dress that I might just wear for aesthetics more than athletics.",
