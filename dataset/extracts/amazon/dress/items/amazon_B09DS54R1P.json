I love how the dress rises on the sides to add a little sexy flair but lowers in the front in back to make sure your covered and your butt isn\u2019t hanging out. I wore this to a salsa dancing class and had so much fun spinning it around but it\u2019s honestly so cute I would wear this anywhere. The sleeves are amazing as well especially if you don\u2019t want to have to wear a jacket. The only thing I had an issue with is the zipper wasn\u2019t super smooth.",

                "reviewText": "This dress is really great! I wore it for my senior pictures, and they came out great. It's very flattering, especially since you can tie the ribbons around your waist to be as tight or loose as you want. Like a lot of other reviews have mentioned, the chest area is bigger, so if you have big breasts, you'll be good. I had to safety pin the top closed to keep my bra from showing. I normally wear a large, and that is the size I ordered. Once I did the safety pin, the rest of the sizing was great. Some people were mentioning how short it was. I'm 5'10 and didn't have any issues with it being too short. Be mindful of how you bend down, but to me, that's a normal rule of thumb with a dress. The dress is really flattering, a beautiful color, and very comfortable. It's not too hot, but it's great for fall weather. I highly recommend it, especially for the price!",

I am a 16/18 and I bought a 2X because I was buying this last minute for a work party and was worried about it being too small. I\u2019m so pleased that I bought this. I felt gorgeous all night, got tons of compliments, and I\u2019ll be buying at least one more color.A couple of things to note:-it is low cut, I didn\u2019t love how low (because work party) but I pinned it and it looked great. My husband insists that, even without the pins, it wasn\u2019t shockingly low.-the sides of the dress do come up pretty high. I wore tights under but it\u2019s something to keep in mind if you\u2019re looking for something more modest.-the fabric was very nice, I felt like it was well made and layered.-I got a 2X but I feel like if you wanted a little tighter fit, a 1x probably would have fit just fine. I didn\u2019t feel constricted at all in this dress.-I haven\u2019t washed it yetAll in all, I\u2019m super pleased. I am not a woman who feels very comfortable in dresses and this dress was a huge confidence booster.",

Pero este Me quedo un poco Justo de la parte superior del pecho y brazos, nada grave.Ten\u00eda pendiente de que fuera muy corto como aparece en la foto pero por mi estatura me quedo a una altura que me acomod\u00f3.Le puse un prendedor para cerrar el pecho ya que con los movimientos se abr\u00eda dejando entrever el sost\u00e9n. Ya ser\u00e1 al gusto de cada quien!Trae un cintur\u00f3n que no viene a\u00f1adido y que m\u00e1s bien se suelta constantemente. No es necesario usarlo.Volver\u00eda a comprar otro color pero en talla L esta vez.Algo que me encant\u00f3 es que llego antes de lo esperado y lo pude usar en las fiestas decembrinas.",
