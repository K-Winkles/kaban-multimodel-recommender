                "reviewText": "I am very OCD. I am always slightly worried about items that are some assembly required as they tend not to line up perfectly or be perfectly straight when done. Which does bother me more than I would like. This specifically looks like one piece in the picture but is actually two pieces you have to screw together in the middle. For that reason the middle is not 100% straight but does sit very flat on a surface. The included metal tubes fit in the spaces perfectly and are slightly magnetic so they stay in place. The magnet is not super strong so you won't disturb the rest of the containers when you go to remove one.Overall it is a nice sturdy piece and holds all my silverware and utensils like I wanted but for someone who is super OCD like me you might want to pass as the middle won't be even and it isn't on solid base.",

                "reviewText": "This design of this product was to optimize shipping above all else. The bottom bamboo base is not a single piece, but 2 pieces that you have to attach by drilling in a metal plate. It will likely not be flush and has a cheaper look to it. I'm sure this is done to keep the shipping box smaller. Additionally, the individual metal baskets are not uniform in size. There are two smaller ones and 2 larger ones so they could fit into each other which I suspect is also for shipping purposes.That being said, the base seems to be made of bamboo. The magnets in the base are also helpful in keeping the baskets secure.",

                "reviewText": "I am trying to re-organize my kitchen. It is a very small, '70s galley-style kitchen and has very little in the way of counter space. One thing that I needed to find a solution to was the fact that the (plastic) drawer that I used for utensils recently shattered from old age...so I need to find a space-efficient but functional way to store my utensils stove-side. This is working well for me. It doesn't hold a TON of them, but it DOES hold enough for my needs in the way of wooden spoons, spatulas, scrapers and such.",

After receiving this organizer, I washed up the metal cups and put all the utensils I had on my counter into this organizer and they all fit! Not only that, it takes up a fraction of the space I was using before.One thing I wish is that the cups were interchangeable with each other, because I could've had the bigger ones on the outside instead of in the middle. Besides this, I really like this organizer and it has really helped clean up my counter. I highly recommend.",
