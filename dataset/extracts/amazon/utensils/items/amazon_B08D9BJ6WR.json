Although the whisk with the set is covered with silicone so it won\u2019t scratch cookware. The holder contains all of the pieces but they\u2019re a little tight. I intended to put them in a drawer anyhow so if you do plan on using the counter top jar, maybe put only the essentials in there. My old nylon set were starting to flake and warp. I\u2019m hoping this set lasts me many years. I might get my sister a set for her kitchen as a gift.** these are on the smaller side. The spoons are not deep and the ladle is small. Some of the spatulas and other items are about 6\u201d long. Still happy but wish they were larger/deeper.",
