I would hate to think a speck was missed by my dishwasher or that there was cross contamination because residue was on something that may have touched it. Overly cautious yes, but I don't care. Also peanut butter is hard to clean off utensils. Disposable? Just toss.",

I like to have these around for making coffee, having cereal, and prepping my cup of Metamucil. Things I usually grab right before I head out the door. They can withstand the hot temps of water when stirring my coffee. They come wrapped in a bag inside the box. They\u2019re great for friend / family holiday dinners also. They\u2019re a little pricey but they\u2019re high quality spoons.",
