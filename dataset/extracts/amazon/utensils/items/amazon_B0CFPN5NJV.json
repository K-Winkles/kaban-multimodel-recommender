This utensil holder holds them ALL. She was concerned that it might not be tall enough for the larger utensils since the advertised picture seems to show small pieces in the holder. But it holds them perfectly. She chose this rectangular holder over round ones because this shape would fit into our cramped counter space. Again, very happy that she did. We would highly recommend this product & would purchase it again.",

                "reviewText": "This is a well made sturdy utensil holder and a great addition to my kitchen and outdoor BBQ. There are many hungry wild critters where I live... and they are crafty opportunists. I cannot leave stuff out there for any extended periods of time. When cooking outdoors on the BBQ (all seasons) I have to transport utensils back and forth from the kitchen to the grill. Now I have a caddy, and it's a nice one! Bravo on this design. It's large enough for my BBQ needs and looks really nice to boot.",

                "reviewText": "After rotating through several utensil holders, we have a winner! This holder keeps all the utensils at the back of the counter space while still providing ample room for a wide variety of cooking apperati. There are two dividers to help with organization. There is also a liner for the bottom of the rack. This looks great and does a terrific job of handling our swiss-arm-knife (knife not included) collection of utensils, so they are right there when we need them. Wonderful",

However, I'm not sure what the included silicone matte is for, and I don't think it's necessary.

It's a great way to keep my kitchen counter organized and stylish.Pros:Holds a lot of utensilsStylish designEasy to cleanCons:Silicone matte is unnecessary and adds to the costRecommendation:I recommend this utensil holder to anyone looking for a large and stylish way to organize their kitchen counter. Just be aware that the silicone matte is unnecessary and adds to the cost.",
