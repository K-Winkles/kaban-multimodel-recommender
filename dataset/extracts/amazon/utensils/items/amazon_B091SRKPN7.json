Those are no longer being made and we've had kids since then, so many of the pieces have mysteriously disappeared. These seemed close design-wise so I ordered the set. They are sturdy with some heft, look good, and seem like a good value for the price. One caution: knives are VERY SHARP for a tableware set -- this is actually a positive but be careful when you first take them out of the package.",
