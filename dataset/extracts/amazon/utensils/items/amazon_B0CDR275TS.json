                "reviewText": "I am so happy with this countertop utensil holder. It's even nicer than I expected with a marble stone base that is really nice. I needed something to hold my tongs, next to my Ninja Foodie, and I was concerned that the material would need to be sturdy and could take a little heat. This is perfect. Both the metal top area that holds the utensils and the stone base are safe next to the Ninja. The 2 compartments are large, so they hold lots of tongs in them and I'll be able to put a spatula and a silicone spatula into the compartments easily with the tongs, as well. I thought it would be smaller in length than it is with only two compartments, but it's so roomy that I will only need one of the two that I ordered, so I'll use the other on a different countertop near the stove. Good product, good size, attractive, made of good materials. Very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "This product is sturdy metal and allows for additional drying, even if you hand wash or dishwasher wash and dry. It has lots of space to add large spoons, spatchulas, whisks, etc. Its the eight seat Suburan of wooden spoon storage. I have had others, but this one probably has the most space. I decided to put as many spoons as I could in it. Was able to put close to 12 wooden mixing spoons, a potato masher, three small to large whisks, scissors, 2 silicon spatulas for flipping pancakes and such. And 3 metal spoons. Yes quire impressive, does take some counterspace, but i still have some room to spare.",
