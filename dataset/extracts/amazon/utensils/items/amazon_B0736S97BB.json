This was especially irritating as this was a very expensive set.Surprise! You can't tell the difference on these. They feel just as weighty and sturdy in your hand. You can't go wrong w/ these!",

My husband didn't care for the ones we already had because they always fell off the plate when he carried it around. This silverware does not. It has a nice weight to it but the handle is not heavy so as to fall off the plate. They are not like the cheap Walmart and Dollar Tree silverware. The forks are not sharp and don't feel like they are going to cut your mouth like some inexpensive silverware does. These go throughthe dishwasher fine.. My only problem with these was when the knives were left in the sink one developed a small rust mark on it but it was easily cleaned with a Mr. Clean scrubber. I would recommend these for every day use.",

                "reviewText": "Unlike many, I have strong opinions about Silverware. I had only 4 place settings of some very nice, high quality, heavyweight Gorham 18/10 Stainless. I love that silverware ! I don't like flimsy, cheap diner type silverware. I bought another set from Macy's (International Silver) and was totally disappointed. Very light, no balance or heft and a pattern that actually dug into your had at the butt end of every piece. I wrapped it up and donated it. I was going to go all in and buy US made Liberty Tabletop (old Oneida brand) for almost $300 for a 12 setting set. I glanced at Amazon Basics 65-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Silverware Set with Pearled Edge, Service for 12 for 1/5th the price. Now, I want to be patriotic and buy American, but I can't justify leaving $200+ on the table. I bought the Amazon Basics set and could not be more pleased! First off, the pieces are HEAVIER than the Liberty Tabletop pieces. They are big and the pattern (Pearled Edge) is done tastefully and virtually matches the Gorham I have. I know it is 18/0 and not 18/10, so the shine will not be as pronounced, but for dinners in which you are not expecting the Queen of England, these are wonderful. Thanks Amazon, excellent value!!",
