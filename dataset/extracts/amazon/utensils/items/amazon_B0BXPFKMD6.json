I don\u2019t know what the deal is with the spoons. They are bigger than soup spoons. Almost as big as serving spoons. Definitely too big for my mouth. I ended up ordering 2 sets of their \u201cteaspoons\u201d. They are the right size. They definitely aren\u2019t teaspoons. They did call them dessert spoons too. If that means anything to you. Anyway, I like this silverware a lot. It\u2019s much heavier than what we had and it\u2019s pretty. Comfortable to use. They stack well in the tray. Not flopping around every time you reach for one. I like them. The price was good in my opinion for what we got.",

The set came in just a small little box, nothing fancy like you would see in a Macy\u2019s or any other department store! I thought the set was going to be thin and cheap, and something that would bend up over the course of a week! But this flatware set lives up to its \u201cHigh Quality\u201d standard mentioned on the box and in the description, it\u2019s sturdy, gives expensive look/feel and the set is heavy stainless steel! I\u2019m in love with my flatware set and will be purchasing more as I toss out my old set! Happy customer!! \ud83e\ude77\u263a\ufe0f",

The feel heavy but I compared them to my stainless steel Henkel knifes and the color of the steel is different.They are magnetic which doesn't rull out that they are stainless steel, but I definitely think it's a lower grade stainless.The spoons are large and fairly deep. Good for soups or ice-cream.The knives have some serrations that aren't ground very well. It will likely only work as a butter knife or on very soft easy to cut foods.The forks have sharp edges between the tines \"pointy parts\" that are rough and have unfinished cut or ground materials in them.Overall for the price I think these deserve 5 stars, but I might change that if they rust in the dishwasher.",
