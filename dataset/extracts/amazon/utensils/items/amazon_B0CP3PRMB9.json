It won't tip over if you fill it with a ton of kitchen items. The color is a warmish light cream, with hint of beige , fairly neutral in most kitchens unless you have the bright white/cool gray theme going. Easy to clean, low maintenance item. I also like the protective bottom so it won't scratch counters if you slide it. A good replacement for what we needed.",

Both my husband and I switch off on cooking dinner and we both have strong, polar opposite, opinions about where cooking utensils are stored. This large crock saved our (cooking) relationship. The ridged white porcelain and oversized mouth were exactly what we needed. For him all of the cooking utensils could fit in and we could place the crock by the stove so it was visible while cooking. For me, I love how the crock is another notes of \"rustic\" charm tying our kitchen together in an aesthetically pleasing way.",
