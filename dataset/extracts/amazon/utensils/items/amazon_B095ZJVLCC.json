                "reviewText": "i had cutlery like on the same track as this and they not good. I was very surprised at how strong these are.they had a nice hand feel and were surprisingly thick. I did re-wash them twice and use them and they were fine. I normally don't wash the disposables but i decided to do it to do this review. if they help the environment by breaking down and not staying like plastic for years and years, it's a plus in my book. i try to be eco friendly but it's really not that easy but products like this make it a bit easier. Friday night we had linguini and shrimp scampi and i made everyone use these forks and not one person had a problem. the tines were sharp enough to piece the food without breaking and no problem twirling the linguini either. they are the same size as my stainless steel cutlery, which i love. Most of the disposables are smaller and feel lightweight and fragile. I love Hefty products so i was not surprised that Hefty did it right. I did order 2 more sets of these. I pack a lunch and breakfast every day for work and i use plastic utensils so now i use these. Great product. if you are using plastic utensils and you find them flimsy, try these. They are almost like using regular cutlery.",

                "reviewText": "Not going to lie. I am a busy mom who picks and chooses her battles. I am ALL about convenience. However, recently my conscious has been getting the better of me and I have been trying to be more eco friendly. I have shifted all my plastic cups and plates to a compostable product. So now it was time for cutlery! So when you think of cutlery you obviously want a product that doesnt break at the first bite and can hold up. These are PERFECT. They are durable and honestly can't really tell its an eco friendly product. The way you can tell is the price. While you are paying more, you are paying more because this product won't just leave around plastics on the earth. BTW these don't just decompose in your garden, a professional composter is needed. Other than that I am so pleased with this product!!",
