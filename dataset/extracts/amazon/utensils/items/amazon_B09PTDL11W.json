The set includes 9 pieces a wooden canister, a drip catcher, basically 3 spatulas 3 flat spoons (one with holes in it) and I guess a serving fork. Again, it looks nice, it was easy to clean, and it should be safe for non-stick cookware.I am curious to se how it holds up to high use over high heat. I know it is a bit of a gamble with wooden utensils, sometimes they don\u2019t last very long, other times they seem to last forever. For example, my oldest wooden spoon is 30+ years old, so we\u2019ll see how these measure up.",
