I know they say reusable, but the point is they are so cheap, why bother washing them. Just use and throw away.The quality is quite good on the tongs. The fork and spoon are a little less so. The forks are pointed and the spoons are oval, not blunt. I was glad they were not sporks.* I write reviews to let you know how this product was for me, and to aid you in your decision to buy or not buy.",
