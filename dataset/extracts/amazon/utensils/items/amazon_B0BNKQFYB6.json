The design on these is classic and simple. They are a good weight and very shiny. It suggests not using harsh or abrasive cleaners because that would dull the finish. I had to go back to the listing to see if they were dishwasher safe. It didn't mention it on the box or in the instructions. They are dishwasher safe!!The edges are smoothed out so there isn't a sharp edge digging into your finger when using. I love that the forks are not oversized or huge. I hate that most sets are like that. I don't need a pitchfork to eat a salad! These are a very reasonable size.I love that it comes in a set for 12 people. I like to fill the dishwasher before running and when you don't have enough silverware it means you run out quick and then have to wait for the dishwasher to finish or hand wash.I'm glad I ordered these. They are reasonably priced. I might even pick up another set for 8 people just as backup for when pieces inevitably start going missing!",

                "reviewText": "I appreciate just how large this set is with service for 12. That alone makes this an excellent value. What I do like is just how solid this silverware feels and looks. They are heavy and have a simple pearled-edge design that looks great. Build quality is very nice. I have been using them regularly and they have help up well. The weight makes them easy and nice to use. They are a substantial size and they stand out in this category for how much you get at this value. I highly recommend these!",
