The 24-piece set boasts heat-resistant, non-stick kitchen gadgets that have proven to be reliable and durable.The copper handles add a touch of sophistication, elevating the overall aesthetic of my kitchen. The utensils have held up well under heat, and the versatility of the set covers all my cooking needs.My only gripe is the company sticker on the side of the holder, which is impossible to remove. A better logo or a more considerate placement would enhance the overall satisfaction with this otherwise fantastic set.In conclusion, the Fungun Silicone Cooking Utensil Set is a kitchen gem with a minor sticker hiccup. Five stars for its functionality, style, and the pop of blue that brings joy to my culinary adventures!",
