Expertly crafted from premium 18/10 stainless steel with a sleek, polished finish, this cutlery set exudes elegance and sophistication. It will fit in seamlessly with any tablescape, table decor, and dinnerware. Perfect For Elegant & Casual Meals Wouldn't it be great to own a silverware set that can be used for elegant, upscale meals as well as casual meals like family dinner or Sunday brunch? We like to say that you can \"dress\" this set up or down. There's no need to dig through the closet to dust off that elegant flatware that you only use once or twice a year when you own this set. Well-Balanced, Ergonomic Silverware When you pick up some silverware, you can instantly tell that quality is subpar just by the way it feels in your hand. They may feel flimsy, unbalanced, or have an unusual texture. Conversely, other silverware lets you know that they're high quality. You'll get a high-end feel the moment you pick up a utensil from our set. Rust Resistant & Dishwasher Safe 18/10 stainless steel is known for its durability and sturdiness. It's highly resistant to rust, bending, and general wear and tear. You can either wash this flatware by hand using soap and water or toss them in the dishwasher for an even faster clean up. Either way, they'll come out sparkling clean.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with this set, buying another now! The large spoons are quite large, but when using them I haven't actually noticed it. They can double as serving spoons for sure, though! The smaller sizes are absolutely perfect for my young kids (4-8). They clean well in the dishwasher. I have had them just a couple weeks but so far they are holding up just fine, no issues at all. They really are absolutely beautiful and compliment my oriental Churchill England plates and bowls so well. We feel so fancy at meal time now! Very glad I went with this set over any others.I personally didn't buy this set for the knives, so I'm not letting it affect my rating, but the steak knives don't cut very well. They did include an extra paring knife that cuts well. Interestingly, the butter knives are sharper than any others I have had, lol.",
