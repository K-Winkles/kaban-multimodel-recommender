OTHER sets had like 100 forks, 70 spoons, and 30 knives. What\u2019s the point of that? These turned out to be surprisingly sturdy! We had tri tip, chicken leg quarter, beans, Mac n cheese, and salad. The silverware held up really well, and I especially like that they say they are compostable on them. We had several comments on how great it was that we had compostable utensils.",
