                "reviewText": "This is a so much better way to store your large cooking utensils than shoving them into a crowded drawer which more often than not turns into a tangled mass of implements resembling a Gordian knot when trying to remove the one you actually need from the ones you don't. By placing this attractive looking cooking utensil holder on your countertop, and filling it with your favorite most commonly used large cooking utensils you not only eliminate the drawer fiasco, but you can now access everything you actually use easily and quickly. This is a very well made quality item with a nice flat black coating over durable steel, all mounted on a nice wooden base. Eight small rubber footpads are provided with it for using on the underside to ensure it does not damage your countertops. There is no assembly required other than sticking on the little round footpads that come on two little squares for peeling them off of for installation, and hanging the small basket on one side or the other of the main rack. Although the main unit has a wooden board under it with drain holes drilled into it, I don't actually use this to dry my cooking utensils, as I still don't want water all over my countertop after it drains through the drilled holes in the wood. I use my dish drainer to dry my stuff just like I always have, only once they are dry I just pluck them down into this rack instead of stuffing them into a drawer. The small basket on the side is perfect for short items like a can opener and bottle opener for example. The main section has three removable, but not adjustable dividers, which I have left in so that I can separate the utensils into categories. This has made cooking so much easier than I would have thought. I never actually realized what a hassle my utensil drawer situation had become until it wasn't a hassle anymore. I don't believe I could ever go back to the utensil drawer arrangement again at this point. I believe this is an ideal solution to a problem many of us are not even aware we have. I can very strongly recommend this product to just about everyone who cooks.",

                "reviewText": "I had one container for utensils on the counter and the rest in a jumble in a drawer. Adding this organizer to the mix really has brought order to the chaos. It's an attractive item so I don't mind having it out on the counter in easy reach while I'm cooking. Now I can have virtually every utensil I want while cooking at my fingertips.I opted for 3 compartments because I didn't want the item to be too huge on the counter. With the basket attached on the end, it's 17 inches long. My kitchen counters are on the deeper side - just over 25 inches, and this feels like an appropriate depth for that. The basket can also be hung on the side, or not used, if you're concerned about that.This is great for bigger utensils like spatulas and wooden spoons. Something small like a potato peeler or thermometer doesn't work well because it'll just slide out through the gaps in the metal sides. But I just keep those in the drawer, which now has much more space for such things.Quite happy with this. I didn't see any of the flaws in the wood that others have mentioned. No rough edges or splinters. I haven't tried getting it wet. I like to have it by the stove with clean, dry utensils, not as a draining rack in the sink.",

                "reviewText": "This utensil holder transformed one of my kitchen countertops and gave me twice the free space I had.Before using this, I had spatulas, spoons, forks, strainers-the whole lot-stuffed into a couple of smaller baskets because I thought that their small size would result in more countertop space. Wrong.These supposedly space saving holders wound up overflowing with utensils which spilled onto the counter top and had to be stuffed in to places that were not intended to hold them.The four compartment holder solved this right away. It is thin and long. and fits nicely on the far edge of the countertop. This puts all of my many utensils in a neat arrangement, and they are mostly unobtrusive, giving the countertop much more space and allowing for other space-gobbling things like a coffee grinder, knife sharpener and vacuum sealer to be moved back from the front.The unit itself is nicely built in industrial-chic black metal, and the holding cages sit on a raised bamboo platform that has perforations to allow any moisture to drain and not accumulate around the utensils.I've learned that any kitchen-like most houses-will fill to capacity over time, regardless of size. I have a small kitchen with a less than perfect shape, but this utensil holder is a valuable addition and makes a big difference.",
