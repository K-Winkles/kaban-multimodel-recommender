                "reviewText": "Last get-together, we had to use mugs to hold our silverware when we ran out of room on the buffet. It worked, but we were serving on gold-edged Christmas china and using a Santa Claus mug to hold the forks wasn\u2019t the special look we wanted.We\u2019ll be better prepared for our next dinner with this metal silverware caddy. We trade off our tableware depending on what plates we\u2019re using so I got this in black. It goes well with our goldware, silverware, rose-gold set, black and silver set, and turquoise enamelware. Disposable eating utensils fit in the compartments, too.It came assembled with only the center ring to hold it, needing to be screwed in place. The base stays in place and the section holding the four compartments spin. The individual compartments are three-inches deep and larger dinnerware can fit and not fall out when the caddy is spinning. It worked fine whether all four compartments were filled or just one.The scrollwork design is detailed, with no unfinished edges and the price point is comparable to the quality.",

The average knife is 9\" in length. Do the math. I wanted this specifically for utensils, so I am very disappointed.I started putting in my knives on one side and they were too long and the whole thing tipped over. Now, you could load each quadrant, like three spoons, then three forks, etc. In theory, that may stop the tipping but what happens when you remove an unequal number of silverware? It won't work. I think it may work with plastic utensils.It does move well, so it would work with cosmetics, office supplies or even individually packaged condiments. Just don't use it with normal sized metal utensils.",
