Not only is it beautiful and I love the fact that it comes with a holder but it\u2019s durable and it just comes with so many different things that we actually didn\u2019t even know what three of the items were meant to be used for and we had to look it up.I scoped out so many other ones on here that looked nice but the reviews were absolutely horrible.And I\u2019m telling you right now, this must be hand washed!Don\u2019t be lazy and put it in the dishwasher because it is not dishwasher safe and it will get ruined. Shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for anyone to wash it in the sink. But so far so good and we love it",
