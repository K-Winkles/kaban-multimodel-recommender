The spoon is just a little too shallow, but they feel super nice quality (though the spoon had a few blemishes out of box) and stack perfectly into a really thin little container. They're definitely the best travel utensils I've seen personally. I can't speak to the quality of the knife, but I can't imagine it's very effective just looking at it and feeling it. It seems that's pretty common of a design for travel knives. It will work for something simple like buttering toast, though.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly these are pretty great. The knife is essentially a butter knife, but the little serrations means it's still reasonably useful for cutting. They stack, they clean easily (they go in the dishwasher with no problem), they nest in their case well, the case clicks closed and stays closed. The spoon is a little shallow, but it's completely usable.The only improvement I would ask for: I wish they made a set like this but that fits in the Bentgo Classic. I would love steel flatwear to fit in the Classic.",
