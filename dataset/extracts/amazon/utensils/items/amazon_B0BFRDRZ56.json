                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We liked the EWFEN Hammered Silverware 40-piece Stainless Steel set so much that we ordered a 2nd set! Read on for our impressions after using and washing.-- VERY ATTRACTIVE: The styling of the set attracted us to it, and upon receipt, we were not disappointed.-- WELL MADE: Excellent workmanship in every piece. We inspected all 40 pieces and rang our fingers. We found the edges and found every piece to be perfect without any defects, and all the edges were smooth to the touch!-- GOOD GRIP. The textured or \"Hammered\" handles are very attractive and also provide an excellent secure grip when held in hand.-- NO RUST! We washed the entire set a few times in the dishwasher and found no rust whatsoever on any of the 40 pieces!-- OH SO STRONG! There is no bend in the fork or spoons! The narrowest section on the handle is 1/8\" thick. The spoon would allow scooping hard frozen ice cream with no bend in the shaft!-- NICE HEFT: Comfortable to hold but also good weight, and they just feel right when held.-- EXCELLENT KNIFE EDGE: The dinner knife's serrated edge is sharp enough to cut meat yet wide enough to easily spread butter on bread!-- WEBPAGE IS WRONG ABOUT WASHING: The seller's Amazon web page states gentle washing and drying are necessary, but elsewhere and on the box it states \"dishwasher safe.\" And as mentioned earlier, we washed them several times in the dishwasher, and they came out perfect. -- COMPETITIVE PRICE: The appears to be competitive for similar stainless steel sets.Update: -- ONE PIECE RUSTED: After many uses and dishwasher cleaning, we found only one of the knives with some small rust spots on the blade and handle. Picture attached. We still think it is an excellent set and will just put aside the one knife. -- MAGNETIC TEST: We performed a magnet test on the silverware using a very powerful neodymium magnet, and the pieces had some iron in them. Non-magnetic stainless steel has a lot of nickel and is highly resistant to corrosion, which is super important. If the piece were fully magnetic stainless steel, it would corrode and not last very long without the nickel to stabilize the metal. See our magnet test in the attached video.CONCLUSION: Highly Recommended!",

They do out these in the dishwasher and make sure jo water gets left on them so maybe that's why. But did buy a set for myself and love them so far. They are strong, beautiful, and priced so great :)",

Thank you.However, one of the small spoons came with sharp edges as shown in the pictures. I noticed minor details on other pieces, but nothing worth pointing out here.Had it not been for that poorly finished small spoon, this set would have been 5 stars.I tried to get that single small spoon replaced, but in order to do that I had to send the entire set back. I decided it wasn't worth it. But I suggest better quality control before packaging and shipping out.Recommended set.",
