Our wooden utensils can go into a compost bin right in your backyard. Do these utensils have a taste that transfers to food? No. Many plastic alternative utensils are made out of mixed materials that are not natural and include chemicals. Our utensils are made of 100% wood, meaning they are chemical free and do not have a taste that transfers to food. Are these BPA Free? Yes. Our utensils are 100% natural birchwood and contain no BPA, plastic, or any other artificial materials. They are very plain and simple wood cut and pressed with heat for optimal performance.",
