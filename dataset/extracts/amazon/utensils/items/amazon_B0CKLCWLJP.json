                "reviewText": "Packing lunches and taking meals on the go often means relying on wasteful plastic utensils. But what if there was a stylish and sustainable solution? Enter the 4PCS Premium Travel Utensils Set with Case from Lengnoyp. But does it deliver convenience and eco-friendliness without sacrificing quality? Let's dig in!**Stainless Steel Savvy:*** **Built to Last:** Made from high-quality stainless steel, these utensils feel sturdy and substantial, unlike flimsy plastic options. They're also rust-resistant, ensuring they'll be your mealtime companions for years to come.* **Easy on the Planet:** Ditch the disposables! This reusable set helps reduce waste and your environmental footprint, one lunchbox at a time. Feel good about making a sustainable choice.**Portable Perfection:*** **Compact & Convenient:** The included carrying case keeps your utensils neatly organized and protects them from getting dirty in your bag. Plus, its small size makes it easy to toss in any backpack or purse.* **Lunchbox Ready:** The fork, spoon, and knife are the perfect size for lunchboxes, picnics, or even airplane meals.

                "reviewText": "I travel a lot. Because I am on a special diet, it is often hard to get restaurant food I can eat, but I can usually buy fruit, bread, hummus, yoghurt, so on. I hate the plastic flatware that comes with fast food, so I bought these. The utensils look pretty, and they are in a very useful box that is easy to drop in a purse when I am driving or put in my checkin luggage if flying.This stainless-steel set is really small, but for spreading stuff on bread, eating yogurt or ice-cream the knife, fork, and spoon it is fine. I tried cutting an apple with the knife; it was a real struggle because the knife doesn\u2019t have much of a serrated edge. Also because the handle edges are squared off, putting pressure on the knife hurt my fingers. I wasn\u2019t able to peel the apple at all. That was a disappointment.On the whole I am glad to have this set, but I will need to find a better knife for cutting hard food.",

                "reviewText": "The product arrived as described, with 1 of each: fork, knife, spoon, and a plastic case. The case is semi-transparent as shown in the picture. It is somewhat sturdy but it's not a hard case. Nice feature about the case is that it has vent holes to keep everything dry. Also, the case is roomy enough to hold the 3 pieces and I can see it hold twice as much. The utensils themselves appear to be of decent quality (not high) and should function as intended. Although this is marketed for travel, the utensils are of good size and you should be able to use them comfortably as a full-sized. I have used some other travel utensils and I felt like I sacrificed useability with convenience of travel. Overall, this is a good set of travel utensils for any food/cuisine on your travel. The only thing I would add is a pair of chopsticks in case you want to try Chinese food (be sure the length do on exceed 180mm / 7 inches to fit the case).",
