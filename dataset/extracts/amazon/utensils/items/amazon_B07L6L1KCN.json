            "DESIGNED FOR LITTLE HANDS AGES 6-18 MONTHS: This clever Pre-Spoon, tailored for tiny hands, eliminates scooping and balancing struggles. Best of all, there's no wrong way to hold it, thanks to its secret: a thick contoured handle that provides a secure, no-slip grip.",
            "EASY SELF-FEEDING FOR THE FIRST STAGE: Make the starting solids transition easier (and more fun!) for baby. Each set comes with a pre-spoon perfect for purees, doubling as a teether for sore gums, along with an open-channel spoon designed to grip soft solids. These spoons help teach the skills and motions needed to graduate to a traditional spoon, without requiring wrist rotation to use - a skill children typically don\u2019t develop until 2 years old.",
            "PERFECT FOR ALL TYPES OF FOOD: These versatile spoons, designed for babies aged 6+ months, are a mealtime must-have as your child\u2019s eating habits mature. Add this essential to your baby registry now for when baby\u2019s ready to start soft solids. Unlike traditional spoons, GOOtensils grip the food to help keep things less messy.",
            "EASY TO HOLD FOR BABY LED WEANING: Let baby lead the way. Our innovative, patented Pre-Spoon has a unique all-flat design that empowers your little one on their baby-led weaning (BLW) journey. While other baby spoons are too long or too flexible, this one is just right\u2014allowing little hands to self-feed with ease and without frustration.",
            "SIMPLE TO CLEAN & PEDIATRIC OT RECOMMENDED: Approved and tested by baby care experts, our spoons are incredibly durable, ensuring long-lasting use. Made with food-grade silicone, they\u2019re free from harmful chemicals like BPA and phthalates so you can feel good about giving them to your little one. Clean up is easy in the dishwasher. Microwave or steam-sterilizing is not recommended (and not needed)."

She was able to use utensils consistently well by 1.5 yo. These spoons work great for yogurts, peanut butter and anything else that\u2019s kind of sticky. They also gave my baby the sense being independent and eating with us at the table.They just have a temporary use for new eaters. But I think they\u2019re worth it. They\u2019re well made and look nice. I think they\u2019re durable and would have lasted through multiple kids if I didn\u2019t loose them while moving.",
