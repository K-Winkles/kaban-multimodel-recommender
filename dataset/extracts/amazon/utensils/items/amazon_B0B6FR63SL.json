The chopsticks however are are the exact same length as the other utensils so they are about two inches shorter than standard chopsticks making them awkward for me to use but as an inexpensive lunch set I have no complaint.If the chopsticks were expandable I\u2019d give them 5/5.",

The silverware is a good quality with a very good finish and has a quality feel/weight/balance to the set. The small zipper bag is also perfect for keeping the silverware contained and clean. I have already recommended this set to another coworker and would buy it again if I were to need another set.",
