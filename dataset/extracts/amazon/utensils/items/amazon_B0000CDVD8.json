        "description": "Product Description A kitchen essential, a good pair of tongs will see you through the toughest cooking tasks while protecting your busy hands from the heat of the oven or stovetop. The OXO Good Grips 9-inch Tongs with Nylon Heads are constructed with sturdy, high-heat resistant nylon, so they\u2019ll stand up to hot grills while being safe for your non-stick skillets. Our Tongs feature scalloped edges for a secure grip whether you're rotating thin asparagus or flipping a thick steak. The handles provide a non-slip grip and absorb pressure so you can grip, toss, turn and flip with comfort and control. The Tongs lock closed for compact storage when hanging or in a drawer. The 9-in/22.5 cm size fits comfortably in the hand. Dishwasher safe. Also available in 12-inch size. Amazon.com Not only do these 9-inch tongs cushion hands and provide thumb rests, which are useful when gripping heavy objects, but the nylon heads won\u0092t scratch nonstick cookware. Doubling as a hang loop, a tab on the bottom pulls out to lock the stainless-steel tongs shut, allowing them to slip easily into a drawer. The nylon heads are heat-resistant to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and the tongs are dishwasher-safe. --Ann Bieri",

                "reviewText": "I wouldn't say these have the feel of silicone, which can be a good thing. It's more like a harder resin plastic material.They are great though! These kitchen tongs are the perfect size for a 10-in fry pan, or even to dip into something like a 4 quart or 6 quart pot or pan to stir meatballs and sauce, pasta in boiling water, throwing vegetables around a frying pan, EtcThey feel great in the hand, and unlocking the tongs is as easy as tapping them against your thigh like everyone else does. The lock is secure.Washing them is easy as well, since they tend to be non-stick at the tips. The trick is to use the tongs, and then try to rinse them off as soon as you can with some warm soapy water. Try not to let them sit overnight or anything dirty. It'll just be harder to clean them in the morning.I am a huge fan of Oxo good grips products, and this is definitely one of the best from the company.If you use these in combination with the Oxo good grips 10 inch nonstick frying pan, your frying pan will last a lot longer. They do not scratch any non-stick coating or anything. But whenever you grab onto something like a piece of frying chicken, or fish, you do get a solid connection and the feeling of confidence that nothing is going to slip out of these tongs.",

Decid\u00ed comprarlas por Amazon y la verdad es que no me arrepiento. Tienen el largo suficiente para poder usarlas sin quemarte, las partes protectoras de las pinzas fue lo que m\u00e1s me gusto, ya que en las puntas trae esa protecci\u00f3n que no raya las caserolas, as\u00ed como protecci\u00f3n en los laterales, previniendo que te quemes. Las he usado para dorar totopos, voltear tortillas, voltear chiles, capear camarones, voltear papas fritas, y algunas otras cosas m\u00e1s.Creo que son lo suficientemente resistentes al calor y al aceite.\u00f1, adem\u00e1s que tienen un dise\u00f1o muy elegante.Me gust\u00f3 mucho! :)",

These do it really well, they feel nice in the hand and it's easy to grip food, etc, firmly.Rinse and repeat... Is it just me, but I like stuff to last. I've a few OXO items and they seem to last really well. Yes, there are cheaper alternatives. But as the saying goes \"buy well, buy once\". The OXO Good Grips Locking Tongs feel solid and well built. I expect them to keep going a long, long, time.What else do I like:The grips, on the handle, are slightly \"sticky\", it stops them slipping about.They can be locked closed and that mechanism doubles as a hoop for hanging them, so plenty of storage optionsBeen through the dishwasher a couple of times and have come out looking great.",
