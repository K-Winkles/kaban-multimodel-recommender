                "reviewText": "I like that this utensil holder rotates. It\u2019s also very non-slip, so much so that I have to lift it up to move it forward. I wish the container had 3 compartments or dividers that spanned the full height. Unfortunately, my utensils don\u2019t stand up easily, and now the holder needs almost 5\u201d of clearance to spin. Luckily, the clearance is only needed near the top, so that my can opener fits underneath, but my stove only does half the time. Adding more utensils (4-5 per section) does not help prevent the tilting of the utensils. Instead it seems to make them tilt more, which also makes it harder to pull them out. I have it sitting underneath a cabinet that\u2019s 15.5\u201d above the countertop, and still the utensils hit the cabinet when trying to extract them from the holder. It\u2019s functional, but maybe not worth the $29 list price.",
