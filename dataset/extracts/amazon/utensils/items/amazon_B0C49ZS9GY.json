The only issue I have had with the sat, are the steak knives. After the first time, I washed them, they started to rest. The exposed metal on the handles started to rust, they don\u2019t cut very well, and the actual blade has started to rust as well. Other than that, the forks, spoons, and the butter knives are all absolutely fantastic. I would buy the set again, but just without the steak knives.",

I'm happy I took a chance I personally love them. The test will be when my family and friends are them. They definitely are Rose Gold and my new dinnerware is pale pink. I know what was I thinking \ud83e\udd14. We'll I definitely wanted a whole new look and happy I did. The product is sturdy and made well even the butter knives are able slice pretty much like a steak knife. I honestly can't wait for my son and finance visit this week. My son will definitely comment on everything. She however loves Rose Gold and probably love it! It's probably a younger generation look but I'm young at heart. I'll let you know what reactions I receive and will attach pics of the set up.",
