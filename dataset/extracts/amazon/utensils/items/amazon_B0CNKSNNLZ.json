                "reviewText": "This fork and spoon set is an accompaniment to a Bento box, as stated in its description. This set is adorable and a well-made set for a child. The tops of the fork and spoon rest together in a round snap shut adorable holder for sanitary storage. The holder opens easily when you take the adjoining handles of the spoon and fork sticking out of the holder and separate them. The handles are a smooth plastic and will be comfortable in small hands. This set is perfect for home and travel. If I had anything to critique\u2026it would be that the fork is a bit too straight - there is little (to no) curve to it (which I find to be more comfortable for eating). Other than that small adjustment, I recommend this item.",
