My little one refused to use any utensils unless they looked like mom and dad\u2019s, which was starting to become a safety issue (think big fork almost going directly into eye). Thankfully I found this set and now it\u2019s the only utensils he will use!! They fit perfectly in his hands and he thinks he\u2019s using the same ones as mom and dad! The quality is another level. Real silverware yet light enough for tiny hands to maneuver and strong enough to hold giant ravolis. What I wasn\u2019t expecting are the motivational words on these utensils. They make every meal special and I love that we can work on \u201cpatience\u201d while eating or hand my son a reminder to be \u201cbrave\u201d before he heads to daycare. These are genius!Emotions Utensil Set for Kids (4pcs) Stainless Steel Engraved with Motivational Words to Encourage Eating | Ages 2+ | Child Flatware Cutlery Set | Valentine's Day Gift for Toddlers and Kids",
