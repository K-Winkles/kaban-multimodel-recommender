                "reviewText": "These are wonderful and heavy duty Built .. I didn't think they would be so thick when they said Big .. it's wonderful for arthritis and very stylish looking. I was hoping with the silicone going so far up, nothing will break off at the ends like so many I've seen in pictures. Nope this is wood all the way with silicone tools securely built through to the ends. No worries of these ever breaking .. ever. Silicone would ware out before that. I absolutely love the look of these and nope the wood won't be burnt by me with the extra long silicone build & hold. It's like these were dipped in silicone .. very cool. Every tool has come in extremely useful and very functional. I choose these also for the unquie'ly cool flat spatula. That works so excellent for eggs as I was hoping it would. They are bulky is the only thing I'd say .. I have ball jars I store them in .. definitely need ah big old school large mouth tall jar for these. For now they are split into 2 big Blue Ball Jars that fit lil extra with them. This color matches may pans perfect too in color. Try'n for not 50 shades of gray. \ud83e\udd23. There were another set I was choosing between for quality in secure silicone fitting .. I like wood .. those were also wood and good quality but I'm very happy I went with this set .. they didn't have the same spatula which workout in my favor. All these utensils are more functional than I expected.. they all have extra unquie'ly cool quality that these normally don't have. It's hard to put into words .. ya gotta try them & see them directly to understand I guess ya could say best. For the money these are most certainly worth it's value. I'm very pleased + these wash up so nicely. I don't let greases soak in but after I'm done cooking everything rinses and easily wipes clean, stain free so far. That I'm really pick with. So far these have past my expectations 100% .. I wasn't expecting more than a secure fit .. without the ends breaking off after being used for so long. I wasn't happy with the cost at first .. now I am totally comfortable with it. I'd fully suggest this if you're interested in history with your cooking tools like I am. Happy Shopping .. ohhhh yes, I'd definitely gift these to my kids or anyone that loved cooking or house warming gift even. These would also be good for gifting games, just an idea that randomly hit. Enjoy your day.. \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udf3f",
