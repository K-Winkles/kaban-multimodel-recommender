                "reviewText": "I picked this big utensil holder in the gradient green color, and I'm very pleased with it indeed. It's really nice quality - heavy and sturdy, and with a beautiful glaze.The size and weight of the utensil holder means that it's very stable sitting on the kitchen counter even when there's nothing in it, and that it doesn't wobble around at all when I'm putting utensils in/taking them out/rummaging around trying to find that one beloved spatula or whatever. I have a VERY full utensil drawer (don't we all?) but I'm also one of those 'out of sight is out of mind' type people, where I apparently am not in possession of enough object permanence to remember that I actually own X specific utensil, let alone remember to use it. Thus, I've pulled out a selection of different utensils that I use frequently (or would, if I could lay my hands on them when I need them) and put them in this jar so they'll be right there on the counter when I need them. Next up: clearing out that drawer altogether and evicting some of the inhabitants that turned out to be duds and are just taking up space.All in all, this jar is lovely - it's very useful, and it looks very nice indeed sitting on my counter!",

                "reviewText": "This utensil holder is a good size -- it's relatively big and can hold a lot of items, whether that's kitchen utensils or handyman or gardening tools (if you're looking to add a splash of color to your workshop of garage). It'd also make for a lovely vase. It feels like it's made from a nice, sturdy ceramic (breakable, of course, since it's ceramics -- but the walls are relatively thick and it doesn't feel fragile, as far as this type of material goes). The red-to-orange glaze is really vibrant and eye-catching. I own a few Hasense products now and they're all quite nice.",

                "reviewText": "This ceramic utensil holder from Hasense is the Goldilocks' of utensil holders. It's not too big. It's not too small. It's just the right size.I ordered the graduated green version of this utility holder and it is exactly as pictured and described in the Amazon item description. I ordered it as a companion for a similar but overcrowded utensil holder we already had to hold all the non-spatula, forks, and other tall utensils we have. This one is definitely bigger and holds more than our old utensil jar so the taller, larger items have found a new home here. Further, it is very thick, has a good weight and is pretty stable making it a better choice for pulling out a tall utensil when you are in a hurry on the stove.I'm very happy with this order and see us getting years of use out of it. Definitely a recommend to anyone looking for quality, at-hand convenience and storage.",

That may just be my preference, so no stars deducted. I do recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really lovely jar. It's a bright blue color, but not garish. It will add a pop of color, for sure, but doesn't look out of place in an adult home. The variation in blue is nice too--kind of a mix between an ombre and a stripe. It's nice. The mouth of the jar is pretty wide, so you can fit a lot of utensils in there. It's a great height for kitchen utensils, too. The shape has a graceful curve, so it's not a boring vertical line but you also don't lose out on interior volume very much. It's hefty, so it won't easily be knocked over, but it also isn't so heavy that you risk damaging surfaces. This could easily double as a vase--probably most easily for artificial or dried flowers/plants because there is no drainage hole. Really quality, beautiful product.",
