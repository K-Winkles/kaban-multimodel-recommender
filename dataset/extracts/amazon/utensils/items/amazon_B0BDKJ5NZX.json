I\u2019ve update my review to 5 stars, the silverware really is beautiful and that combined with the seller quickly addressing the issue and quality customer care I received are honestly worth more than 5 stars!I really love this silverware, it\u2019s sturdy and it is pretty. There are a few things that are somewhat disappointing, one of the knives has what appears to be rust (straight out of the box) and the handles are not what I was expecting from the pictures. They are sloped off, so it tapers from thick to flat at the very and and some of them feel a little rough/sharp, I really love them but I\u2019m still thinking over whether or not I will keep them.",
