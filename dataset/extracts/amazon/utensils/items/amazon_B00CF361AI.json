I still reuse one of the forks, but I love knowing that when I DO have to toss it that it will not be around for the next...many, many years. People don't realize that plastics are permanent fixes for temporary solutions, so anyway that I can alleviate the amount of plastics that are discarded makes me feel even just a little better. It's not much, but every little bit..",
