So IDK if it\u2019s even worth writing a review.So if you\u2019re like me and are too lazy to wash dishes, these are the best choice for disposable cutlery. They are sturdy, and thick and have smooth edges. And if I do have a moment of environmental guilt, I can throw them in my little countertop dishwasher and they don\u2019t melt.I balked at the $19 price and ordered some cheap brand. HUGE mistake, the others broke constantly. I was picking plastic utensil pieces out of my peanut butter and the spoons were so thin they could cut my mouth.Choose Glad, they are the best hands down.",
