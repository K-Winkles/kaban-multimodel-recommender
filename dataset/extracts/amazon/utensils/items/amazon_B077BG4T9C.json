                "reviewText": "I have only one negative and a suggestion. The neg is it doesn't come with a meat fork. Needs one. And the container to hold the utensils in could be better designed so the the other things like the pizza cutter and measuring spoons (etc) could be at hand rather than having to put them in a drawer. This set is very well made and seems to not leave gouges in my cookware. Best is it won't melt like the plastic set does.",

                "reviewText": "NUMBER ONE THING: do not use stainless steel with your non stick pots because it will scratch the non stick coating!These work pretty well. Used them with cast iron. There are a few things I didn\u2019t and probably never will use (wine opener.. I just don\u2019t drink wine but the set was a good enough deal that I don\u2019t care about not using one or two things!) but the rest were all pretty good.The cheese grater is a little harder to use just holding, I think I\u2019d prefer a stand one but it worked just fine, just took a little more work.The slotted spoon didn\u2019t let any pasta besides spaghetti through. Great for serving. I do wish a pasta spoon specifically was included in the set.The tongs were easy to maneuver with one hand. I could pull the open tab or push it back in easily and it didn\u2019t get stuck.Pizza cutter did the job. Spatulas were able to flip eggs without the eggs getting stuck. I\u2019ve only had them about a week but these are good tools for a good price (the same things are $8/each at Target). Good gift set for someone for like a wedding or house warming gift because it has everything you need besides the pasta spoon!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a stainless steel set to replace my current collection of various plastic, aluminum, and wooden utensils. This is a nice set that has everything I need. Reasonably priced. The handles are comfortable to hold. I do notice water spots on them after washing, but that's not a big deal to me. I didn't use the holder it came with. The bottom snaps on the holder but I don't think it's very strong. It came apart when I was moving the holder. It snapped right back on - but I didn't trust it anymore so I decided to keep my current holder to use with this set. It would be nice if the holder was one solid piece instead of a bottom piece that snaps on. But overall I am happy with this set.",
