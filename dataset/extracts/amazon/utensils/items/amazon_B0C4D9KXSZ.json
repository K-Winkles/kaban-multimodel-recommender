                "reviewText": "This utensil holder arrived well packaged in a cardboard box and protected in a plastic bag. The utensil holder is quite large in size measuring 40cm in width by 11cm in depth and 18cm in height and is split into four sections allowing you to organise all your utensils with ease with a very large capacity. I do also think that since the unit arrives assembled that this means there is less weak points in the design.It is made from a sturdy black metal wire cage (which has a matte finish anti-rust coating) with an oak base which looks very premium. It is quite weighty so doesn\u2019t tip from the weight of utensils and it doesn\u2019t shift about the countertop at all due to the non-slip pads on the base which also protects it too. It looks very nice displayed on the countertop and means you don\u2019t have to have several pots / holders, instead combining it into one aesthetically pleasing unit.The slick design is easy to clean down and has good ventilation but personally I won\u2019t be drying the utensils in the holder as I don\u2019t want to damage the wood over time. Priced at \u00a329.99, with an additional \u00a33 off voucher valid until the 30th July 2023 at the time of reviewing, this seems reasonable for the quality and I would definitely recommend it.",
