The metal in the middle adds a nice touch and makes them more durable. The price is very reasonable for the quality and variety of the utensils. They are easy to clean and heat resistant. The only downside is that the container they come with is too small to fit them all, so I had to buy another one. But that is a minor issue compared to the value I got from these utensils. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good set of kitchen tools.",

The utensils are slightly smaller than other sets I've owned. For me, this is not a deficit, because I find them far easier to work with. They are heavy enough to be useful, but not so much as to be tiring, and they are well-balanced. And I love that nearly every utensil included fits neatly in the holder.I previously owned a highly rated brand of tools that collected water in the connecting parts, and they would drip forever every time I washed them. Well, okay, not forever--they dripped until the handles fell off. No drips here. Such a relief.I handwash my silicone utensils, because my dishwasher never fails to leave spots on silicone, but I was curious how these utensils would fare, so I gave it a whirl. From that experience, I learned that if I'm in a hurry, it is safe to put them in the dishwasher. They spot far less than my Oxo silicone turners do, which I did not expect at all.",

                "reviewText": "This is a lot of kitchen in one box. It is a ridiculous amount of everything you\u2019ll use and things you will never use. Any complaints I have are small and picky. Handles are kinda bulky (the shiny parts), but it is holding up. Measuring cups are difficult to read from a distance, but actually raised numbers so they\u2019re going to be better than the painted on numbers in the long run. Mitts are small, and if you grasp straight on, there is less material between the grooves that heats up quicker. It all works well enough to be great overall. This would be a fantastic housewarming or graduation gift. Keep it in your b&b, or take on vacation. It would be nice to have while you\u2019re moving, so you\u2019d have immediate access to utensils instead of hunting them in whatever box it all hid in.Sure, you could get higher overall quality stuff, but for the price of a nice spatula and whisk you get so much more. As things wear out or break, replace them with higher end items, as you can afford them.",

This will be a great addition to your kitchen or be given as a gift. Highly recommend!",
