My only complaints are 1. the pizza cutter was very flimsy 2. the rubber ends are great but they attract dust and fuzzies which cant be wiped off easily. I still love the set and i\u2019m glad I found it. This would definitely be great for anyone starting out in a new place or someone just looking to replace their utensils on a budget. Additionally, the holder for the utensils is a little smaller than I imagined and hoped, but it still fits everything I need it to hold from the set and won\u2019t tip over.",

                "reviewText": "I understand that there are cheap alternatives to certain necessities and whatever that is, is expected to not be as durable or sturdy, but it baffles me that there are entire manufacturer warehouses that build these certain things knowing how unreliable they are. What's the point of creating something that doesn't hold up? At least for a while? I've had this set for about a month. The can opener worked for like once and is completely useless, the ice cream scoop is as flimsy as a spoon, the utensil holder is very light and can easily be tipped over due to how tall some of the utensils are , and the whisk wires are not driven through the whole handle. In fact, they're very short and already starting to come out.Granted, you do get a lot out of this set and the main cooking utensils (Spatula, stirring spoon, tongs, ladle) hold up pretty well.At the end of the day, I expect for whatever I pay for to do its job for a reasonable amount of time",
