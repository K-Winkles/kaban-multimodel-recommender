                "reviewText": "I managed to throw my old knife and fork in the trash (or that is my strong assumption) by mistake as I was cleaning my lunch container at work. Made do for a while with less than perfect substitutes but now it was time to upgrade. I didn't want to take from my silverware stash at home, nor did I want to buy a 20-piece set for this relatively simple need. I didn't spend a whole lot of time researching and decided to splurge my $6-7 on this set. The only negative comments seemed to center around the somewhat flimsy plastic container and I second those sentiments. So I immediately wrapped a rubber band around the box as it was unlikely to stay closed otherwise. Besides that I think the box is adequate and even has room for a set of chopsticks should I need those).The utensils themselves are actually quite nice: rounded & smooth edges (unlike in my previous set) and I'd be surprised to see any rust (again unlike my previous set), normal adult size with enough heft so they don't feel like they are going to bend too easily. These are perfect for my work lunch needs.",

Very portable and doesn\u2019t take up much space at all, I love that it has the travel case. Perfect since I had moved into a dorm and didn\u2019t want to keep spending money on plastic ones, or have more than necessary with more dishes to do.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this silverware set for days I work in a shared workspace. Simply keep in my rolling briefcase and I'm all set. Chose stainless steel since easy to clean, nice looking and keeps those germs at bay. Must admit...the carry case is super cute. All I did was wrap the fork, knife and spoon in a couple of napkins, they fit no problem inside the case - and it's off to the shared office. Will save a ton not having to purchase plastic cutlery sets anymore. Some restaurants are cutting back on providing plastic utensils with to-go orders. Great to have my own personal set whenever I need it. Carrying case could fit in a large handbag, backpack or tote too. Doesn't take up a lot of space.",

                "reviewText": "The silverware itself is really nice, it is sturdy and has a good weight behind it. The silverware is really easy to clean. My biggest problem with the product is the carrying case, which is really why I bought the kit for the case. The first time I purchased this product, the case broke within a week, it was returned and replaced. Now a little over a month later, the case broke again in the same manner. I can still use the case but the break is probably going to spread and it is very disappointing that it broke twice in the same way.",
