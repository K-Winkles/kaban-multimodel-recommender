It holds all of my cooking utensils with room to spare, but it doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space on the counter. My only complaint, is that the paint in not sealed. As I was cleaning it before I put my stuff in it, I noticed some sawdust and black paint on the rag. I plan on sealing it myself so that the paint lasts longer and doesn\u2019t continue to wipe off anytime I have to clean it.",
