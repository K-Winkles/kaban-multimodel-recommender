I love this set.I'm puzzled by reviews that talk about spotting and even rusting. Mine rinse off with warm water and soap if necessary and look new. Dry easily and rapidly. As for rusting, that's ridiculous. These are high quality polished stainless steel. Actually, any stainless steel will develop rust spots if you grind off the passivation layer and expose raw iron particles. But unless you take a grinding wheel to these utensils they will never rust.I have been using mine daily for two years and they look like I just opened the box. Best stainless utensil set I have ever bought in terms of shape, thickness, strength, and overall appearance.Oh, and by the way, I was really surprised how the serrated side on the knives actually cuts steak easily. Not many inexpensive utensil sets have knives like these.",
