                "reviewText": "This is a 12 piece set of stainless steel toddler tableware. There are three different colors in this set of spoons and forks for children silver, rose and gold. That way each child can pick their favorite color and can have their very own color silverware. They seem to be made well so far they have washed up nicely I washed them by hand the first time did not put them through the dishwasher yet. I believe the little ones will have fun eating with silverware their own size not to mention it fits their little hands much better than big adult forks and spoons. As a little bonus there's a picture of a cat and/or a dog on the handle of each fork or spoon for an added cuteness effect.",

My grandkids are able to use these without help and because it is wider it holds the food on. They go in the dishwasher with all the other silverware for easy cleanup. Coming in different colors lets the kids have their own sets that no one else will use.",
