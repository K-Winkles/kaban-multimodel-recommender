                "reviewText": "You can never have enough utensils in your kitchen. This stainless steel cooking utensil set is a perfect addition to your kitchen. It comes with 11 different utensils and is made of quality stainless steel. Not super thick, yet still very sturdy. It\u2019s a basic set but also comes with a stainless steel crock to hold all of the utensils and a stainless steel spoon rest. The surfaces are smooth, so it is easy to clean (either handwashing or using the dishwasher) and dries quickly. They don\u2019t scratch or damage cookware or pans. The ladel is a bit shallow for me and when it\u2019s packed full, the thin frame can dig into your fingers or hands a bit, making it slightly uncomfortable to use. I wish they had just beveled off the edges a bit on the handles. This set covers most of your cooking needs and is a great gift or addition to your kitchen. They come well packaged and are great for the price point. I recommend these without hesitation.",

They are quite sturdy. The stainless steal is strong without being overly heavy and they are really easy to clean with no nooks and crannies to get gunked up. I was especially impressed with the tongs. They look like a traditional set, but they are noticeably stout when you hold them. I've had other tongs bend with use, but these will last.

I really like that the utensil holder, and the handles of the wisk and masher are brushed stainless steel which matches my appliances and does not show fingerprints. The utensils are great quality.The only thing I noticed was that the slotted spoon came with some black smudges by the slots which appeared to have happened during manufacturing. The smudges wiped right off with a dry paper towel. When you wash your utensils before using you will want to make sure to clean the slots of the spoon and spatula to make sure there are no black smudges. This was not a big deal to me because I already planned to wash them before using.Having been to several weddings lately, I think this would make a very nice, affordable, bridal shower or wedding gift.",

                "reviewText": "This 10 piece kitchen utensil set looks just like the pictures in the listing and is even prettier in person. The finish is shiny and clean and will brighten up any kitchen. The assortment of utensils covers most of your cooking needs, and I love that they even include a spoon rest in the set. The stainless steel canister is well made, shiny and easily stores all the utensils. The utensils themselves are not super heavy, but they aren't lightweight and cheap feeling either. The tongs are a little short but certainly very usable, I just prefer longer ones when cooking. The set comes in an attractive box and would make a great gift for someone moving into their first home, but its also nice enough for a higher end kitchen as well.",
