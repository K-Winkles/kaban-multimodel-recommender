The carry case that came with it even had room for me to add floss sticks, my travel toothbrush and my suppliment packets. Great Buy and Great Quality, thumbs up!!",

                "reviewText": "Got these for my daughter to take with her to work. It was a surprise for her. She loves them! So convenient and easy to carry with her. Covers all the bases: fork, knife, spoon, plus chopsticks, 2 styles of straws, and a straw cleaner all in a nice carry bag. I chose a colored set for her so that she can tell in an instant when she takes them out of the dishwasher which ones are hers for work and which ones stay at home.Pros:ColoredAll the needed utensilsIncludes straws and a straw cleanerSturdy carry pouchCarry pouch is lined and easy to cleanCarry pouch also has a carry strapAll of the above seem to be quite sturdy and dependable and do not sacrifice in qualityCons:Have not found one yetIf I had to stretch to find a con, maybe make the bag the same color as the utensils. This way if multiple family members have the same sets in different colors, it would be super easy to tell whose carry bag is whose, but it is not really a con, just a wish and a suggestion really.Overall, I would definitely say, buy them! They came in super quick as promised, they are sturdy and sure beat disposable flatware. It is a very nice set. If I decided I needed another set for another family member, I would certainly buy these again. Would also recommend them to friends.",

The simple aesthetic also pleases my minimalist nature.My only issue thus far has been with the angled straw...

Really love that it is stainless steel so you won\u2019t get flaking off of the utensils. Highly recommend. The case isn\u2019t great but I only use it for storage at my work desk.",
