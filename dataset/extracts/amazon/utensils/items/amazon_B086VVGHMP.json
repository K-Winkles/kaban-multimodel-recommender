My house was built in 1950 and my drawers are 18.75 inches deep and since the Technical Details list the product as 18 inches deep I thought this would be perfect. But it is NOT 18 inches deep. It is only 17.5 which leaves 1.25 inches for the divider to slide from front to back each time you open the drawer. I am now trying to find something to wedge in the back of the drawer to prevent it from sliding",
