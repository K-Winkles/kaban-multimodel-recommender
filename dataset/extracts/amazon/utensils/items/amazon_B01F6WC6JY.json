                "reviewText": "Only one of the 5 utensils was finished. One was properly tapered and sealed. The others seemed to be of a lessor quality wood without attractive figuring, color and tapering. I am disappointed. AFTER MY WIFE has been using them for a couple of weeks, she finds that they are perfect for the job. She says that the utensils are beautiful, the right size and shape, the handles are the right diameter, much better than anything else she has seen. She handwashes them and finds that the silicone has not melted are gotten softer or stiffer. I have never seen such a change of heart! Hint - all of the handles need to be sealed.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the gray set. They are beautiful. So much nicer that the solid black nylon utensils they replaced. So far I\u2019ve used the spoon and the spatula. The spoon is very sturdy. No flexing when you scoop up heavier food. I used the spatula to make scrambled eggs and loved that the edge has a little flex to it. My husband commented there were no dry bits around the edge of the pan. It\u2019s because this spatula conformed to the edge of the pan when I was stirring so nothing stuck and dried out. These utensils are very easy to clean. Even if food dries on them it washes right off with warm soapy water.",
