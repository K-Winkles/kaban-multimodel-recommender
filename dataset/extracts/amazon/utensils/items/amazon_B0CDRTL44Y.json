I got on Amazon and scrolled through many counter top utensil holders. I chose this one because it looked sturdy enough not to tip over. It won\u2019t. Wide enough to hold a lot of spatulas, whisks, etc. It will. The only thing, I did not like the sound of a metal handle hitting the bottom of this ceramic pot. I used a well-folded paper towel on the bottom to cushion the hits. It works. This looks expensive. It wasn\u2019t. It is very pretty. My niece likes it very much. Now she has more drawer space.",
