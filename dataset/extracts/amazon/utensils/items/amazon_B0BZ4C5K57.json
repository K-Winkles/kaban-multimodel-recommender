I have not run them through my dishwasher, even though it says they are dishwasher safe. I prefer to keep them as new looking as possible. The knives are not an aggressive edge. I wish they were slightly more cutting. The spoon is a very generous size and while at a different angle than most spoon bowls, it does not change how you have to eat. Nice long handles. Slim and sturdy but if you suffer from hand pain, they might be too thin. Definitely not ergonomic, but aesthetic.",

I'm afraid as pretty as it is my family may not like its thin and lighter weight for balance as compared to my current very standard Mikasa flatware (prob TJ Max purchase). The salad fork is more a dessert fork. 4-stars on durability only to give benefit of doubt, as I haven't used them yet. Enjoy!",

The set received was carefully packed (although, the box showed polished nickel color, was a bit confusing). Saw some reviews saying some rough or sharp edges could be found on some pieces. It was not my case. Took my time to unpack each piece and inspected thoroughly. Having preference for a slightly heavier utensils, I was pleased with that absence of that weight in that particular set which contributes to the elegance of it. The color/coating was consistent through out all pieces, and, I hope, will stay this way as I opted in to handwashing instead of putting them in the dishwasher. Not only this product has a good quality/look balance, but, also, price/quantity of pieces included.",
