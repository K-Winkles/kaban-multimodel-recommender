These are stylish and the color selection is great for your kitchen preference.The silicone material is a lifesaver for me because they don't scratch my non-stick cookware. The variety of utensils in the set covers all my cooking needs, from stirring to flipping and serving. The silicone is also easy to clean which is a big bonus.The whisk did seem to break after a few months of use. could have been a fluke though, but with that price point I would still purchase a whole new set once I plan on ditching my current one.",
