This set is sturdy and feels similar to regular household silverware for daily use.The knife is serrated and good for meats. The spoon is the perfect soup spoon shape and size. Love it. The chopsticks are a bonus, and it makes eating a salad more fun. And if you're in a hurry, you can put the used silverware in the secure case and wash everything at home.Two thumbs up! Great for lunches, camping, picnics, college, cafeterias, and traveling. This is a good set and will save you money in the long run over disposable utensils. And less waste from plastic utensils.",

But the main complaint I have is that we use our home set of utensils and then they don\u2019t always make it home and our set is short! (grrr)This will be great to not only hold all I need, and keep them from getting dirty in my lunchbag or accidentally falling out, but also, I can put them back in the case dirty and it\u2019s all easy to wash!These are a little shorter and lighter weight than the set we use at home, but that means it\u2019s lighter for me to carry! The edges could stand to be a little more rounded.Very happy with this set!",
