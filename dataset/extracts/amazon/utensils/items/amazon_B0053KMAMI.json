It is a little less sturdy than most brands you might find in the store but as long as you aren't trying to peel a cantaloupe or cut through an ice cream cake fresh out of the freezer you will likely not have issues. This set will get you through 100 bowls of cereal, 100 plates of cake and 100 cans of wet cat food serving because I don't use plastic knives much so that is their place in life now. They are mostly transparent and are sorted by model of utensil in the box which is nice to keep them organized and simple to grab.",

                "reviewText": "These were by far the cheapest plastic cutlery we have ever purchased and it is also dangerous to use. When attempting to cut thinly sliced boneless chicken on two occasions three of the prongs snapped off with pieces in the meat that I put in my mouth and almost swallowed. These are completely unsafe and it is disgraceful for Amazon to sell this product let alone to sell it and with the entirely false and misleading marketing. Amazon has received snd posted countless reviews substantiating my review and some even have pictures and/or videos which are clear corroboration for Amazon.When I called Amazon to complain and to warn them I was not aware of their complicity in this matter. As I spoke to the customer service representative to tell her to flag this product for safety reasons I began to scroll down the page and noted this evidence of Amazon\u2019s proactive partnership in this consumer safety product fraud. To wit, the overall rating of the product on 12/09/2022!when we made our first purchase was as follows: Overall Rating 4.0 stars out of 5 Customer reviews 3.9 stars out of 5 By Feature (all rated out of 5 stars) Light Weight 3.9 (likely due to flimsy product materials used to manufacture) Sheerness 2.5 Value for money 2.3 Durability 1.9 Sturdiness 1.8When doing simple addition and division to come out with an average rating the customer feature reviews come out to an average rating of 2.4 NOTHING CLOSE TO THE 3.9 Customer Reviews\u2019 Average ListedAnd definitely not close to the higher overall rating of 4.0 which is what many Amazon customers rely to use when selecting products.In this case, the cheapest, most flexible and easiest to snap (literally when using a fork as I did with nice thin sliced chicken I can snd have used the dull edge of a knife or spoon if only cutlery that was available to me. Although I hope no one has been hurt or required CPR from unknowingly swallowing a prong of one of these forks, it is a matter that may legally involve Amazon in any lawsuit. As it stands, Amazon may have violated consumer fraud laws in some states\u2014happy potential class action lawsuit defense.By not posting this review or censoring it, Amazon may be conceding liability. And no, I am not suing Amazon but rather doing what they should have done upon receipt of information that should have resulted in an investigation to determine the safety or danger of these products.",

It works, but I'd rather have something a bit larger and more sturdy. I'd probably reccomend these for a young childs birthday party or something but not much else.",
