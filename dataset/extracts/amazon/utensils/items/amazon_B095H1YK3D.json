My husband who was a Quality Control Director before he retired was very impressed and also gives this 5 stars. Don\u2019t hesitate to purchase this organizer if you are looking for a sturdy, adjustable organizer for your silverware. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "This fits well in our drawer, I just wish it would expand a little more to reach the edge width of my drawer. It\u2019s been hard to find an option any wider. The only complaint I have is how much it slides in a wooden drawer. They included a few plastic dots to put on the bottom, but that hasn\u2019t fixed it. If it fit the drawer perfectly it wouldn\u2019t move, but the depth of my drawer allows it to slide front to back more than I\u2019d like. I\u2019m considering hot glue dots on the bottom to give it something to stick with.",

It's a little short lengthwise, but I can probably get a narrow holder to fit in the gap. It could have been a bit deeper, but I did manage to put my new set of flatware for 12 in it. Well packaged. Satisfied with this purchase. I may buy another for my utensil drawer.",

Don't buy this unless you're okay with being overcharged for a mediocre item.The good:- It holds cutlery.- It's the correct measurements.The bad:- This is the quality I'd expect at the dollar store.- The base of the product is made of a cardboard composite material with a fake wood pattern printed on it. Not 100% bamboo as claimed.- Flimsy. As pictured, the parts made of real wood are splintering in various places and its held together by loose nails.- Weird black spotted stains which don't wash off, and it was a bit dusty.- Personally felt the need to disinfect it before putting my cutlery in it.My thoughts:I can live with it, but it's not worth the asking price. This is a great example of why I don't like to online shop for products like this anymore.",
