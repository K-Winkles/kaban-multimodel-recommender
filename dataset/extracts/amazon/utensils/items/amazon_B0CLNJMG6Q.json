                "reviewText": "We absolutely love this set, and we are so glad we chose to receive this sample to try out. All the pieces in this set wash easy, we have put them in the dishwasher with no issues, and they stack to store away very nicely.The material used to make this set is a type of hardened plastic it seems, but they are very durable and reliable. We have switched over to using only these versus glass plates, and it\u2019s a nice feeling to know if you accidentally drop one of these it will not shatter all over your kitchen. The plates are big enough to eat supper on, the set has smaller plates for dessert or a snack, and the bowls are the perfect size for cereal or whatever you want to use them for.The one con I would list, even though it\u2019s not a huge deal, but the spoons are pretty big and sometimes tough for a child to use. The forks work great and no worries about one of the prongs bending or breaking off when using. The knives surprisingly will cut many different meats without any worrying about a child cutting themselves or hurting themselves while using. Overall this complete set is great, well designed, built to last, great quality, and at the price point they are listed for they seem like a steal. I definitely recommend this set and I feel anyone would be happy using this product.",

                "reviewText": "This set of six place settings has pretty much everything I need for my daily use: 9.7\" plate, 7.8\" salad/dessert plate, 2 2/3 cup bowl, and a 1 1/3 cup cup. Plus the knife, fork, and spoon utensils.I just recently found out about wheat straw and am so happy I did as they're a bio-plastic that's eco-friendly and free of petroleum based plastics since there's no fossil fuels used to make it.Just, as you may have guessed, it's made out of a wheat by-product that was just being burned after the wheat was harvested so it's not only an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum based plastics it's using a waste product that was polluting the environment previously.Even better wheat straw is anti-bacterial and anti-odor! That's a win-win right there.Oh, and if anyone is worried that they're made out of wheat: they're gluten free.The set is really lightweight and crazy durable. It's safe for dishwashers (on the bottom rack even) and microwave too. I nuke stuff all the time with these and there's no scaring like you can get in petroleum plastics over time.These are my new daily-driver dishes.",

I\u2019ve figured out that putting a small glass plate in between them keeps them from falling but still annoying. Depending on your dishwasher rack you may or may not enjoy the same problem.",
