It's realy nice that there's an indentation for your thumb to get a grip on the handle. The spatula/turner is a nice size, thinner at the bottom for easy turning. Easy to hang. I wish they had a ladle included. Bought these during Prime Days for a great price. Would make a nice gift. One more thing: There are no white spots or water spots when they come out of the dishwasher. Easy to handwash, as well. Look expensive, I like the stainless steel between the handle.",
