The wood in the middle of the handles is smooth and comfortable to hold, and the silicone tips are gentle on my non-stick pans. The set comes with everything I need for cooking, baking, and serving, including a utensil holder and hooks for hanging. They look great on my kitchen counter and add a touch of elegance to my decor. I think this is a perfect Valentine\u2019s gift for anyone who loves to cook. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for quality and style in their kitchen utensils.",

It'll be nice finally having a matching set of various cooking utensils instead of all the randoms I've built up over the years. Pictures are accurate, including the 10 S-Hooks and container. Subtract 11 pieces from the full count and you end up with 22 actual utensils. Still breaks down to just over a buck a piece, so that's good in my book.Should be noted though that whatever finish they use on the wood isn't good. It was about 50% gone after the first run through the dishwasher and completely gone after the second run.I am going refinish/seal them with linseed oil and they should be fine.I would recommend gently hand washing and drying immediately if you don't have a way to properly seal them after washing the original finish off.",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered this set of kitchen utensils and overall, I think they work fine. However, I do have one major issue with them - they are really small. This has caused quite a problem for me in the kitchen as they don't quite do the job they are intended for. I wish they were a bit larger to make them more practical for everyday use. Overall, I think they are okay, but the size is a big drawback.",
