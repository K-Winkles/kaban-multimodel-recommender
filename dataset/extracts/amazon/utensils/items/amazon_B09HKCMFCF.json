                "reviewText": "I was drawn to this set of silverware because they had a tray that came with it, to use in the drawer, and they looked very similar to my current set of silverware. The tray is very nice, but unfortunately was too big to fit in my drawer, so I use it elsewhere in the house. The silverware is a nice weight and comfortable, but I have noticed that a few of the pieces have either been dinged or sat in water too long and have begun to show small rust spots.",

The white tape used to seal box did not stick to the cardboard. One side completely broken away and a piece of white internal foam was on my doorstep. The tape on other side had not stuck. The loose cutlery peppered the inside lid with pot marks.As I said very lucky nothing was damaged",
