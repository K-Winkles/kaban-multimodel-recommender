                "reviewText": "Most drawer organizers seem very shallow to me. Most seem to be under 2 inches tall. My initial reasoning for buying this was the fact that it is 2 1/2 inches deep. The adjustability was a bonus, and it makes me wish my drawers were wider! It looks really good when you open your drawer, and wipes clean easily. The 5 flatware spots can be widened or narrowed depending on your needs.My drawers are a little over 15 inches wide, so I only got an extra long narrow slot on one side that holds loose measuring spoons nicely.I've never had an organizer that fit my drawers front to back, which means it can slide if some yanks open a drawer quickly. Even the best of rubber legs will slide if the drawer is opened hard enough. To prevent this, measure the space from the end of the organizer to the back of your drawer, and cut 2 pieces of Styrofoam (lots of things come with Styrofoam packing) about 2-4 inches wide, and about 1/8 inch longer than your measurement. Place one block at the back on each side and slide in your organizer. Since the Styrofoam is a bit bigger than your measurement, you will hate to give it a little push. The Styrofoam will compress and hold the organizer in place with no sliding.",
