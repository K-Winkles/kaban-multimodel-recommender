They are light to hold in the hand and the spoons, even the bigger spoons fit my mouth well when eating soup / chili.I hand wash all my dishes because it's just me and I don't have a dishwasher, so my only complaint is that if I do not hand dry these, they get water spots. If this is an issue for you, I would recommend purchasing something different. For my needs they work great and I am glad I bought them.",
