The ones I found come with either wood or silver handles so I decided to buy the closest color (khaki).PROs:- Sturdy but will not damage/scratch ceramic or tefal surfaces- Love the khaki color It is unique and pleasant to look at.- Comes with different utensils for various cooking use.- Affordable. The cheapest silicone cooking utensil I've found was priced $3.99 for a piece.- Includes a small container to hold the most frequently used ones.CONs:- Handle length may be short for taller people. The size is perfect for me but I'm 5'1.\"- The container is small and won't fit all the utensils.Overall a great product. It comes exactly as seen and as described on the pictures and desclription. Very affordable and definitely worth the money for the number of utensils you get.",
