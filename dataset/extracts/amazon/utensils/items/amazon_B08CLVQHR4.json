I liked the idea of having wrapped forks, spoons and knives so that each guest had their own set rather than setting out the typical pile of plasticware that is unprotected for anyone to touch. The plasticware forks,etc themselves were of pretty decent quality. They were not extra strong/sturdy, but they were of sufficient sturdiness that they did not break or bend during use. I had no complaints from guests. I loved that they also came with a salt and pepper pack each so that I did not have to put out community salt and pepper shakers. I would definitely buy these again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Opening the box: be careful when cutting the tape because there's no protective layer underneath and it only takes a tiny bit of depth to cut into the top layer sets. Better to peel the packaging tape off instead.Handle with care: I took one set out, gave it a light shake, and almost immediately the clear wrapper tore open. It should be ok if you're just planning to handle it right before use.The material bends easily under pressure but at least it doesn't seem prone to breaking (I hate it when they break and pieces fly off). The fork and knife should pierce/cut ok as long as the food is soft. I don't know if the other forks are the same, but the first one I took out had wonky tines.The salt and pepper are ok but I do wish the pepper was ground finer. The napkin material is smoother than I expected, almost like paper, but it should do the job.Overall it's ok as long as you're not looking for a set that feels sturdy and just want utensils that come in a complete set and serve their basic purpose.",
