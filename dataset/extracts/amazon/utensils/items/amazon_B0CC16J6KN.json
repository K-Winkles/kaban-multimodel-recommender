                "reviewText": "Utensil Holder Kitchen Large Ceramic Utensils Crock for Countertop Table, Heavy Porcelain Farmhouse Utensil Holders Non slip Anti-scratch No Wobbling, Easy to Clean, Blue -JH JIEMEI HOMENo matter how organized your kitchen is, you always seem to end up with a handful of utensils that you use so often oh, that they end up living on the counter rather than put away in a drawer somewhere. That's where a utensil holder like this one comes in handy, in fact, I would consider it a must. I was a little apprehensive at trying a porcelain utensil holder at first, I've got a metal one that I've used for years, and it has had its fair share of abuse. After seeing and using this porcelain crock for my commonly used stovetop tools, I'm not worried about it anymore. Physically it's heavy enough so that it doesn't tip over if you grab a spoon or something out of it when you're in a hurry. It's not too heavy to move around the counter, but it's heavy enough that it stays put. it's big enough you can get a lot of different utensils into it. I recently started using some of the new stoneware coated pans, and I am trying to be vigilant about not scratching them with utensils, so I'm using this utensil holder for just my nonscratch utensils - bamboo, silicone, etc. I've been using this one for a month or so, and I'm pretty happy with it. If you're in the market for a utensil holder and you like the design of this one, I would say go for it. It's good looking enough that you don't mind sitting on the counter all the time, and it does a good job holding all of your stovetop tools inside.",
