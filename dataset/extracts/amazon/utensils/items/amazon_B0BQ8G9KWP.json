                "reviewText": "Lots of pros!! 1) Very soft rubbery grippy handles for little toddlers to hold. 2) The fork tooth is rounded and not sharp for young children. 3) Very slim low profile case to store utensils. Fits inside a lunchbag easily without taking up any space. Could also easily fit inside the zip pockets of most lunch bags as well. 4) The handles are long enough to use even in a deeper container such as the kids Simple Modern food jar. See pics of spoon in both Simple Modern and Thermos food jars for comparison. 5) It's stainless steel and not plastic. No more unsighlty tooth marks! 6) It is simple and easy for toddlers to put the fork and spoon back into case when done. It doesn't require any specific placement in order to close case. Some others require everything to be placed in a certain way in order to close lid. Not this one. Just both ends in the same direction. Hope this review helps!",

The silicone handle is soft and nice, and it picks up a perfect portion, and when I\u2019m done I slap those puppies into their little container, which is slender enough to fit in an inconveniently small lunch box, but large enough I\u2019m not searching around for the fork or spoon I knew I threw in there\u2026plus I\u2019m not using a plastic bag or anything similar to put my utensils in.
