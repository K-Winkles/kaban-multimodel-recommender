                "reviewText": "I was looking for a spatula that could last a lifetime and heavy abuse (scraping pans on occasion, flyswatting on a brick wall once a blue moon, perhaps driven over by a truck once or twice). This is not that, which is ok considering the price of stainless stock. I thought I wanted some billet monstrosity that could sooth my irritation with the dozens of poor quality kitchen tools I've bought. Sure, the spoons bend, the tupperware is as thin as carryout containers (and priced as if it comes with a meal) and the teflon on my aluminum pans is mutating me...but at least my spatula could pry open a car door. I thought I wanted that. This is something else.It's better.The handle is sturdy but hollow, which precludes its use as a jackstand while making it exceptionally well balanced in the hand. Going hollow allowed it to be lightweight and sturdy while still filling the hand, making extended use easier on bloodflow. I can close a 200lb gripper, but my old spatula still gave me a slight cramp in the palm musculature. This one does not. The spatula part is thin but not so thin it will distort or bend with a lifetime of normal use. Perfect for slipping under potentially sticky food items if you use stainless pans. I suspect the handle is two pieces which may eventually fatigue & begin to separate under the torsional forces these tools experience, but based on similar handle designs in thrift stores that doesn't seem to happen for decades. At this price I don't care.It's beautiful, it fits with my thrift store cuisinart pans. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I had a wok spatula similar to this, but with the handle welded to the spatula portion and contructed of slightly thinner material. The spatula lasted about 2 years and started to crack at the joint. The handle was hollow, and the weld evidently was porous and allowed liquid into the hollow portion. I liked the shape and fuction, but the contruction was poor. I was looking for a similar shaped spatula but without the drawbacks the first one had. This is the One! the stainless is definietly heavieer gauge than my old one. The spatula and handle are one piece. It does not bend in my normal use like the old one dis. Hanging from my utensil rack, it looks nice too. I've coooked about 10 meals with it so far and no negative issues. It is sturdy, cleans well, works like I expect a tool like this to work. Great Tool, Great price.",
