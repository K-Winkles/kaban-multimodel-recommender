The design is simple yet modern, making it a great choice for both formal and casual dining occasions.The steak knives included in this set are also of excellent quality. They are sharp and sturdy, with serrated edges that make cutting through even the toughest meats a breeze. The knives are also made of high-quality stainless steel, ensuring that they will last for years to come.Overall, I highly recommend the 24 Piece Silverware Set with Steak Knives for anyone looking for a high-quality, durable, and elegant flatware set. The set is versatile and perfect for both formal and casual dining occasions, and the steak knives are a great addition for meat lovers. The mirror-polished finish adds a touch of elegance to any table setting, making this set a great investment for any home.",

                "reviewText": "So a pictures worth a thousand words. Except here. Read the description.The silverware(butter knives, fork, spoons) Couldn't be happier with, sturdy in strength, feels good in hand, and looks great. (High Fingerprint visibility however after handling)The \"steak knives\" just toss em when ya get them. They're junk, cheap made plastic handles, and the metal in the knives is a completely different metal than the silverware.Now my only gripe and it's on me for not throughly reading. But when the picture shows 5 of each item and you receive 4 of each item its a little disappointing to go back and read that yes it does say set for 4.So a 3 star for the quality and look of the silverware, if the knives were better and the pictures weren't extremely intentionally misleading it would be a 5 star. The knives could still be junk and I'd still give it a 5 star if the pictures weren't misleading.So read the description, and beware of knives. Other than that I would recommend!",
