I\u2019ve had this silverware set for about 3 weeks now and I\u2019ve put them through the dishwasher several times and they are still nice and shiny. No tarnishing or rust in sight.They are also very sturdy and have a good weight. The edge of the spoons are a bit sharp at first but I think with continued use they will become more dull. I haven\u2019t had an issue with that. Overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",

The utensils have a good weight and feel to them. I've already put them through many dishwasher cycles (at least 20) and no rust at all! I am very excited about that as that was my main criteria picking the utensils. They are very shiny; the design is a bit simple but works for me",

They only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is the base of the utensils are so wide that they do not fit into my dishwasher silverware sorter. If you have wider slots for your utensils in your dishwasher then you have it made. I believe you will love this set.",

                "reviewText": "We have a seaside rental property that needed new flatware. I was cautious about ordering this item and it was delivered today. It is absolutely beautiful! Heavy - and sturdy feeling. I'm going with the other reviews i carefully perused and taking it on their recommendation that they wash perfectly in the dishwasher. Just wanted to say that for the price of this item -- I am very, very pleased. Now -- as long as the renters don't accidentally put them in the garbage dissposal or somehow some pieces end up in the trash -- we'll be all set. However -- if that does happen -- I can certainly order another set with out much of a loss! Thank you!",
