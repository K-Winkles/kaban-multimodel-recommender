We have a lot as we don\u2019t really have a drawer that will fit most of that stuff being in a small apartment. This doesn\u2019t take up a ton of counter space, it\u2019s longer more than it is wide. The inside has 3 compartments but the sectioned pieces slide out and can make it one large space.We had a massive round utensil holder before this and while it held a lot we still struggled to fit most of the items, this makes it seem easy.It comes with an adhesive piece to have it on the wall but honestly think the weight of it would be too much. It also came with some small cushion type sticky rounds for the bottom so it\u2019s not directly on the counter. The bottom has some holes in it incase anything it still wet when placed in it. Very sturdy and doesn\u2019t become top heavy with a bunch of utensils in it and is great quality.Overall great product, love it so far and don\u2019t foresee any issues with it.",

Only thing I would point out is that mine came with one of the rungs slightly bent inwards, but that won't stop it from functioning. Much better than nothing.",
