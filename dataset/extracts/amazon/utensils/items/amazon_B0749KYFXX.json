I like the silicone pads on the handles to have somewhere to rest your hand if the metal heats up and I like that the locking mechanism is easy to grab and also silicone. If you're looking for sturdy, useful cooking/serving tongs, you can't really go wrong with these.",

                "reviewText": "All three work well and come out clean using dishwasher. No rust spots from cheap steel. The open/close mechanism seems to be solid. Only had them a week but used them for grilling steaks and serving a salad. The three tong set is nice but having one of the longer tongs, over 12 inches, would be useful when turning items over hot grill, but for indoor cooking they seem like a good set. Happy with this purchase : )",
