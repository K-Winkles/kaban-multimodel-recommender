As it turned out, it perfectly matches a paper towel holder that I have had for about 10 years, so that was a pleasant surprise. I am very pleased with this purchase. This item is a very good quality, and it's got rubber on the bottom so it does not scratch the countertop, nor does it slide around. I do not have a lot of utensils (I have only put 9 utensils into it) so, if you have a lot more, this may not be big enough for you, but it worked out perfectly for me.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised by the polished finish. The exterior is very smooth and glossy. It almost looks like resin. The item IS marble, and that's clear based on the weight and inside finish (which is not polished). The size is good, and the felt on the bottom is fine. So, I'm going to try to sand the exterior to achieve a more honed finish. I really want a non-shiny, matte look and velvet-like touch.",
