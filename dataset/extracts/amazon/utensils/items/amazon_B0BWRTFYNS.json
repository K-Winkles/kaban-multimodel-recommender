Wipe away excess moisture with a soft, dry dishcloth immediately after washing to avoid dried water spots or marks. Airy drying stainless steel cutlery set is not advisable as this can lead to spotting and even corrosion. 3. Do NOT SOAK silverware set with steak knives in soap water for a long time since acidic chemicals present can damage it. 4. Avoid using abrasive scrubbers or brushes, as these can scratch the finish of your stainless steel. A soft dishcloth or sponge, however, is fine. 5. Recommend hand wash for long-term use and beauty. When using a dishwasher to clean the flatware, impurities in the water, excessive drier, residual washing or rinsing water may remain some stains or blemish on the flatware. The stains are not rusty, soak then dry the flatware, or wipe with a cloth will remove the remaining stains.",

                "reviewText": "This stainless steel flatware set is really beautiful and classically simple. There are 8 each of soup spoons, smaller spoons, dinner forks, smaller forks, flat smooth knives, and 8 steak knives, plus a sturdy organizer with plenty of places for all 48 pieces. The organizer fit my standard cutlery drawer, with space on the side for my serving utensils. The stainless steel is of good quality, and I really like the hammered steel pattern.The only thing that's a slight negative is that the smaller spoons are a little too big to be true tea or coffee spoons, but that really is a very minor thing. I'm really pleased with this set, and that all the pieces came individually wrapped in plastic sleeves so no scratching or blemishes during shipping. Quality set for a ridiculously low price!!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Hammered Silverware Set with Organizer for my newly kitchen. The 49-piece set is not just a feast for the eyes with its hammered design and mirror-polished finish, but a practical solution for daily dining needs for my family.Right from the get-go, the organizer was a game-changer. It keeps the cutlery neatly arranged and easily accessible, saving me time and keeping the space clutter-free. The variety of utensils, including steak knives, ensures I have the right tool for every meal, making dining a delightful experience.The quality of stainless steel speaks volumes as it has resisted any signs of wear or tarnish even with daily use and washes. The utensils have a nice weight to them, providing a comfortable grip and a premium feel. The set is dishwasher safe, which is a huge relief as it saves time on cleaning up post meals.A minor point to note is that the steak knives might need a little extra attention when cleaning to maintain their sharpness. It's a small consideration against the backdrop of convenience and elegance this set brings to my place.The set is very reasonably priced, making it a fantastic investment for those seeking a blend of aesthetics and functionality without stretching their budget. The minor care for the steak knives is a small trade-off for the quality, elegance, and utility this set offers.I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase. I highly recommend this Hammered Silverware Set with Organizer to anyone looking to elevate their dining experience without a hefty price tag",
