                "reviewText": "While the box indicates these are dishwasher safe, the item description clearly indicates they should not be washed in the dishwasher or with sharp cleaning brushes if you want to maintain the finish on the handles. This is typical for all wood items as wood+water+harsh detergents don't mix well. My biggest concern will be my husband remembering they don't go in the dishwasher.This is a beautiful set - the handles aren't 100% the same shade, but I like that part about them as well. The silicone is smooth and flexible, yet sturdy. Good size, well balanced handles. They look nice on display and work well for their intended purposes. I got the set for $18 and change, which was a great deal. At full price they are still less than $3 ea - you can't get the cheap, flimsy ones for that price. Would highly recommend. Would recommend fixing the dishwasher safe mention on the box and would love to see some bright color options.",

                "reviewText": "These are a great addition to my kitchen counters and match the rustic vibe I wanted perfectly. However, the silicone spatulas are pretty flimsy and give way easily making them not useful for scraping bowls. The wooden handles also aren't that durable--after a few washes the color has faded and the handles aren't smooth-feeling anymore. Overall decent for the price you pay, but you will have to replace them within the year of purchasing I would say if you plan on using them often. If they're more for decoration you could probably get them to last longer.",

                "reviewText": "I got the grey set and was expecting at least just something decent enough to use with my new granite cookware - these are much nicer than I thought! Not expensive, either! The wood handles looks great and the silicone utensils are all very sturdy. I've had other silicone utensils that bend too much and flex and it's difficult to even just break up ground beef but not these. The spatula does have some flex to it, but of course that's what a spatula is supposed to have. They are the same size as most of my other utensils, not sure why some folks say they are small - the size is listed in the product description. Any bigger and they'd be tough to fit my drawer. Food doesn't stick, either - they wash up in a few seconds. Drop of dish detergent for greasy stuff. Fast to dry, too. I was just looking for something average and functional but these were a nice surprise. Don't think you'll be disappointed - try them out.",
