                "reviewText": "I wanted to like this product instead I ended up loving it. It is so well-made, it's nice and sturdy, it has four compartments for your silverware, so it doesn't bunch up altogether, it's got draining holes in the bottom, so water does not accumulate, plus it has a little lip all the way around so your silverware does not slip out of the basket. It hooks on any part of your dish strainer. Which is what I like. I can put it on the inside of the strainer, If I have a small amount of dishes to do, I can move it to the outside of the dish strainer if I have a large amount of dishes, and need the room. I would suggest to anyone who's looking for this type of item to purchase this specific one you most certainly will not be disappointed !",

                "reviewText": "It is sturdy, stands on its own, or hooks over a wire dish drainer. Looks and works as pictured and advertised. Perforated bottom allows good drainage and holes are small enough that chopsticks won't fall through. 304 stainless steel should NOT rust. I haven't had it long enough to confirm this. Chrome-plated or plastic-coated wire will eventually rust. It can hold utensils, and also can hold sponges and small scrub brushes. I liked it well enough to order another one. So, with two of them, I'll have one for each purpose.For comparison, I have had 2 stainless steel dish drainer baskets for several (probably more than 10) years that I bought elsewhere, and they get little brown deposits at the intersections of wires. I'm not sure whether it is rust, or deposits from our hard water. Scrubbing those areas with an old toothbrush and vinegar mixed with dishwashing liquid cleans them. I wouldn't say it's difficult, but these intersections are numerous and therefore a little more time consuming than just blasting them with hot water would be if it worked. It's still better than cleaning mold and white scale off of a wooden, bamboo, plastic, or plastic-coated regular steel wire drainer basket. I'm anticipating the same situation will exist with the above Stainless Steel Utensil Drying Rack, but the only thing better might be wire drying baskets and racks made with the same \"never stick\" and un-scratchable coatings of some cookware.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered in mid-April, it arrived timely. It is exactly as described and I LOVE it. It is sturdy good quality stainless steel, and as described and pictured. IMO the price is fair.It did not work with our existing dish drainer rack that sits IN our sink, as the utensil basket is deeper than the drain rack so it would not hook over the edge. Also our drain rack sides slope inwards a bit which would have made the utensil rack hang awry if used hooked onto it. At first I thought I would just sit it on the sink beside the faucet since it will stand alone. However, I did not like it there and thought I might knock it over. Our drain rack does not take up the entire space in our sink so I was able to wedge the basket between the end of the drain rack and the back side of the sink. It is wedged firmly and does not move until l am ready to take it out and clean it. It has not scratched our stainless steel sink.Cleaning is easy enough...but our water is hard and leaves mineral buildup around joints so I have to take a small brush to it to get the utensil basket shiny at the joints again. The rest of it stays nicely shiny. This does not have to be done often and is just a small annoyance. There is not one spec of rust visible on this basket yet.I do not find that the basket often allows utensils to slip through at the sides - a complaint that a few reviewers have had. I am precise though in placing utensils in it so have only once in three months had a problem with a paring knife coming out a space at one end. I see no reason for the side spaces to be any smaller than they are.I do recommend this nice utensil basket and I will definitely buy another if this one gets too icky, but I expect it will last a long time based on my experience with it to date.",
