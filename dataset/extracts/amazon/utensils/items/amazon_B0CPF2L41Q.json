                "reviewText": "This utensil holder looks and feels very durable. The base is a sturdy slab of wood/bamboo, and the metal wiring that makes up the rest of the structure seems quite strong as well.It's also relatively spacious, for what it is, and can hold quite a few items... It's a simple, utilitarian design that I think will be useful beyond just large utensils large serving spoons and spatulas -- if my wife ever decides we don't need this in the kitchen, I'll be very happy to use it in my workshop for storing tools and craft supplies... You could fit a lot of screwdrivers, wood chisels, or tubes of caulking tubes or whatever in this haha.So, yeah, overall I'm impressed by the quality of this utensil/tool holder.And although it's only designed to sit on a flat surface, I think it'd be pretty easy to mount this to a wall if needed as well, by using some small clamps or hooks to hold it up via the wire basket part of the structure, or, if you needed it to hold more weight, then some little \"L\" or triangular shelf brackets could be screwed into the wooden base and likewise connected to a wall.",

                "reviewText": "This large utensil holder is very good. It's made of metal with a bamboo base. It has three big sections to hold utensils of all sizes. It holds all of my spoons, spatulas, whisks, scissors, tongues and more with room to spare. I really like that it came with four small corner knobs to raise it off of the counter, as an option. It's handy and keeps things organized and visible.",
