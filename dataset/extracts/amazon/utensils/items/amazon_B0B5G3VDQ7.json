These silverware sets have been dropped, dishwashed, traveled, etc. and still look brand new (no rust, no tarnishing, no discolorations). My toddler loves them and they make eating so much easier for her. The silicone grip is comfortable and thick. They have attractive colors, designs, and an elevated heart design on the back that prevents her hand from slipping and allows us to prop her silverware without getting food on the counter. I love this company and can tell how much thought and attention they put into their products!",

These have the same look as the big utensils but small enough for her hands to navigate. The plastic covering is thick and durable. Now, some hesitation when cleaning and not drying completely under the plastic handles however, the covers can be completely removed to clean and easily slipped back on or we just left them completely off snd our toddler no longer asks to use our utensils and is completely content with this option! We will continue to order with more kids or as replacements are needed.",
