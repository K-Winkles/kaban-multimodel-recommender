I have them sitting on a silicone mat, and work nicely.They are lightweight, but I don\u2019t need anything heavy, nor would I think that a heavier object would be good for holding utensils in a dishwasher.The space between the dividers leaves enough room to utilize cooking utensils as well.They were packaged very well, and included adhesive hooks for hanging, should you choose to use that option.For me, they were exactly what I needed, and had been looking for, for quite some time.
