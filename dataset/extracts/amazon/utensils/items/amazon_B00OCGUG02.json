They come in four different colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. They are perfect for serving drinks, snacks, or desserts. They can also be used for games or crafts. The cups are disposable, so there is no hassle of washing or storing them. They are also recyclable, which is good for the environment. These cups are great for any occasion, whether it is a party, a picnic, or a family gathering. They are also very affordable and offer good value for money. I paid $6.64 for the 100-count pack, which works out to $0.07 per cup. That is much cheaper than other brands that charge more for less cups. I would highly recommend these cups to anyone who is looking for a fun and convenient way to serve drinks or food. They are durable, versatile, and stylish. They are one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon. I hope this review helps you decide whether to buy these cups or not.",

                "reviewText": "The colors were great!I know that these are disposable cups but I was very iffy of how thin the walls of the cups were. I could also see where the seam of the cup was and it was very weak. I have purchased cups before and had no problem, but this was definitely a bad batch. Would think about it before buying again, but not enough to stop me from purchasing again.",

These are the perfect solution. I don't have to worry about missing cups anymore with these disposable ones. My only complaint is that while I've always received the cups in the vibrant colors shown above, today I received a pack with red, green, gold and silver. I suppose they match the season but the other colors are much more fun. Its not at all a deal breaker, though. I did deduct a star for that. Otherwise, these are 5 star all the way!",
