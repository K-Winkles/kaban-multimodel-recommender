                "reviewText": "If you have teenagers, then you know about magic silverware. My drawer has been completely empty, I\u2019ll search everywhere, and then I\u2019ll find a spoon in the dryer, a fork in the car, another spoon under a bed along with an empty Ben and Jerry\u2019s\u2026 so, I got this set to fill in for missing pieces and it really is holding up to the job. The spoons don\u2019t bend in ice cream, the butter knives can cut through chicken and tender meats without dulling, and the forks are just decent forks. It\u2019s a nice neutral set that seems to be teen resistant.",

My expectations weren't high because of the low price , but I was pleasantly surprised. These are very sturdy and look good as well. I would recommend this set if you need a cheaper set to replace the disappearing silverware .",
