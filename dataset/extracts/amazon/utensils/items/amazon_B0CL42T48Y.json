                "reviewText": "The idea here is to have the tools you use most frequently out on the counter when you start cooking so you don't have to dig around in a drawer while your omelet is burning. (Pro Tip: get out the tools you need as part of your mise en place before you start cooking.)Scrounging through my drawer, I decided that I needed a microplaner, small tongs, a small silicone basting brush, a peeler, a set of measuring spoons, a small whisk and my beloved small offset spatula. If you look at the photos, you'll notice that some of these items are barely visible in the holder. I ordered the 7.9-inch holder. In retrospect, I wish I had ordered the 6.6-inch version. I hadn't really thought about how small some of my tools are. They're not hard to find in the larger holder but it would have worked better with the smaller one.The holder itself seems very well made, very nice uniform finish and the ceramic seems strong. It survived a trip through the dishwasher. It's heavy enough that it won't tip over easily even with a big microplaner sticking out of it. You still need to remember that this is a ceramic item. There's a reason Ming Dynasty vases are rare.This now has a place in my kitchen. Highly recommended.",

It is 6.5 \u201c tall, 4\u201d around and can hold several utensils. They should be the taller ones, as I have some 8\u201d wooden and they just barely stick out of the container. But the majority of my most often used sit well in it and I find it handy to have them right on the counter. The mat black color does look elegant and fragile but it is sturdy, not too heavy ceramic. I do like this item and it looks good with my black toaster and black coffee pot.",

                "reviewText": "This simple sleek utensil holder has a very minimalist vibe to it, and is really pretty. I wasn't too sure about it when I ordered it, but the height of it really makes a difference. Does it hold everything I need? No, but I'm not a minimalist, and I have a ton of utensils because I develop and write recipes everyday, so I need more than the average person. But I really like it and I can see it working for other people much more than I can myself. If it were wider, it would fit my needs much better. But otherwise it is a good, well-made product that I am quite sure most people will love.",
