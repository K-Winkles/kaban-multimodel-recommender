                "reviewText": "This is one of those things I didn't realize I should get until I saw it. We'd been using plastic utensils for our BBQ get-togethers in the back yard, mostly because it just made for an easier cleanup. (Yes, I know...do better...I'm trying.) When I saw these on Amazon, I realized we had a better option.I was pleasantly surprised when I got these and tried them out. It was too late in the year for a backyard BBQ, but I just tried using them for normal meals inside the house.I've used compostable utensils before at work and here and there at some fast-food restaurants, but those were usually on the small and thin side. In terms of size and sturdiness, this was closer to the heavy-duty plastic utensils we'd been using...and there really was no difference in use for these compostable utensils compared to those heavy-duty plastic utensils. I've used the knives to cut through 1+-inch slabs of pork chop and the forks to pick up those cuts of pork and to poke through thick sausage skins...worked just as well as the plastic utensils.At this point, I'm looking forward to using these for our next backyard get-together, probably still a few months away, so I can use them and get an even better idea of how well they work. I don't think there will be any problems, but I'll update here if there are.The main thing you may need to consider is cost. Compared to similar heavy-duty plastic utensils, a set similar to this would probably cost $20 or so for the plastic utensils, while these currently cost around $30. I'll leave it up to you if that's acceptable or not, but I personally would be totally fine getting this set at $30 when it's time to get more.",

                "reviewText": "These forks/knives/spoons are pretty standard for compostable dinnerware. Of course, I don't really have a way to judge their actual compost-ability, but they feel like other compostable non-plastic utensils I've used in the past. I feel like it's important to use compostable items whenever possible to help reduce the long term impact of single-use disposable plastic waste. They hold up well under normal use and were perfect for use at my girlfriend's birthday party. No complaints, so I suppose I will give the full five stars.",

                "reviewText": "Wow! I'm very impressed with these. They look and feel the same as thick plastic cutlery, with a major advantage - they don't shatter if you press too hard. Instead, they eventually bend, but they are plenty strong enough to hold up against your food you are trying to cut through/eat. They are thick and well-made, and I see no manufacturing defects looking through them. The teeth of the knife are plenty sharp to cut through things. It's great that they're also compostable on top of already being excellent disposable cutlery! Overall, I think these are a great product if you want very functional cutlery while doing a small bit of good for the environment as well.",

Aside from their sturdiness I have to comment on how smooth these are, especially the spoon I find so many of the plastic spoons have a rough or sharp edge these are nice and smooth and soft on the mouth.I put these to the test with some meat from the BBQ and the fork and knife did reasonably well, it's no steak knife but it cut reasonably well.For our second meal test with these I upped the temperature a bit and went with deep fried chicken balls. The temps were a bit much for the fork and when I immediately stuck a fork in a chicken ball that just came out of the fryer. A minute later I stuck a different fork in another ball it the fork was fine. This was a bit extreme and that minute I waited basically represents the time it would take to get the balls dished up and over to the table for someone to put on their plate.All in all I am impressed as others have mentioned these aren't cheap but their quality for the most part gets top marks.",
