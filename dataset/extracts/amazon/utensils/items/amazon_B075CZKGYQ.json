I was willing to pay a little more to ensure my knifes wouldn\u2019t end up polluting the environment. When received and inspected there is a label that says \u201ccompostable in industrial facilities. Check locally, as these do not exist in many communities. Not suitable for backyard composting.\u201d So if you are buying these to be earth friendly, maybe look elsewhere or confirm these facilities exist in your area.",
