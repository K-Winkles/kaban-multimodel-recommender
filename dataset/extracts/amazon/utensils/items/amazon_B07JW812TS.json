                "reviewText": "So it was time to upgrade from my basic silverware I could barely afford from my divorce 5 years ago. Fast forward I've got a new cat, new dog, and new wife. Hell, we even have a ball python. Anyway, life is good. Back to the silverware...was searching for something elegent, something edgy but classy. Found it. Finish is more matte, which I love. Upgraded to the 30 piece cause anyone with teens knows. These are black stainless, and they are perfect. Ive reached the age where beautiful silverware gets me excited. Im not ready for my AARP card yet but these really pop. Even the food tastes better. Ok I might be pushing it a bit. But if you are looking for a quality matte black stainless set you can't go wrong. I was born in Aug, so as a Virgo my stuff needs to be perfect. If you know you know. Need I say more? Buy these, thank me later",
