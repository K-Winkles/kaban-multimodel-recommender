I am very happy with this purchase and would encourage anyone looking for a counter top utensil canister to purchase this one. Large size fits many utensils and the fact that it spins 360 degrees is a plus for easy access. The partition piece that comes with helps to organize different types of utensils per compartment. I would most certainly purchase this again! Very, very pleased!",

As long as you are a logical person who can figure out how to place the center divider, it works perfectly with no big gaps as I saw on one of the reviews. It's just what I wanted. Not too big, not too small. After all, one does not need to put the ENTIRE utensil drawer in a canister on the counter.",
