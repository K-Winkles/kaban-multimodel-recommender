I actually am using this holder for those large spray bottles you can get from Home Depot (see photo). It's almost like they were made for the bottles. Since I know most people will be using this for kitchen utensils I dumped a bunch of utensils into the holder. They work great for one side but the other side not so well as the inner fence that separates the sections pops out the minute you grab a utensil. One would have to use a zip tie to secure the sectional to the fence. Considering the price, I probably would have given this a 3 star, but since this fits my needs perfectly for the bottles, it deserves 4 stars from me.",
