                "reviewText": "This set was a great value but the bigger size spoons are BIG. They look kind of ridiculous and my younger kids avoid them. My almost teenager said he likes them for cold cereal. I use them more for serving spoons. I like the feel and weight of these. My old set had heavy handles and would tip over a light bowl. This set is not like that but still feels sturdy. Overall I like it but wish the large spoon wasn't so big that's why I only have it 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "If you are looking for utensils for the \"giant\" in your family, these are it. I got these to supplement a set I already had and sadly these are completely different so didn't quite fit the bill. The largest spoon (soup spoon) is huge. It is the exact size of my serving spoon from a older set and the dinner fork tines are as long as my pinky. This would not be an issue but I am 5 ft 3 and everything except my fat fingers are rather small, short and stubby so this fork would probably do me some damage. The smaller salad fork is the same size as my regular dinner fork from another set. I am not saying this is a bad set it is just not meant for petite people. My 6' 3\" brother in law would, however, feel much more comfortable with this set. It is beautifully made and a bit heavy so great quality which is why I rate a 5 regardless of my inability to use 1/2 of the set.",

It feels great in the hand not cheap or flimsy. The finished has held up nicely. My husband washes his cereal spoon right after eating every day. I got both so if can be mixed and matched for special occasions and be really unique. I love how large the salad forks are and my husband likes the large spoons. Mind you, the big fork and spoons are larger than normal and the small is just smaller than your average large. Even our daughter likes the new silverware. The butter knives can really cut, you can see the serrated edge.",
