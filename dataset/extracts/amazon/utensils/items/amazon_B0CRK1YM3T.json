                "reviewText": "I just received this yesterday and so far, I like it. It really made my flatware drawer more accessible and organized.After reading helpful reviews, I just about knew exactly what I was getting and am very pleased with my purchase. I am going to leave some helpful tips to help prevent some of the issues complained about in other reviews.Mine is very sturdy and very nice, functions very well and definitely upgraded my flatware drawer.After reading reviews of it falling apart and slipping around in the drawer, I took steps as soon as I opened it to prevent those issues. And I would like to share them so that others may prevent future issues. They are very simple steps and basic care for thin wood such as bamboo.Before using it,I reinforced it with some indoor/outdoor wood glue on every single joint.Once the glue dried, I applied wood wax.....top bottom, every side ....everywhere. The wax will help repel water from seeping into the wood as well as prevent moisture in the air from warping the bamboo. If your drawer is near your sink,dishwasher or stove....no matter what wooden insert you buy, it is going to be necessary to wax it and maybe even glue it.. Apply both glue and wax heavily. Allow the glue to dry before applying the wax. Then allow the wax to dry before adding your flatware.Once it is dry, use something in the back of the drawer to keep it from slipping. I used some little blocks of wood to fill the gap in the back between the tray and the back of the drawer. This gave me 3 extra compartments as well as kept my tray securely in place.I also used a little thin peace of wood to keep the slide outs from slipping shut everytime the drawer is opened. The wood blocks are very simple as well removable solutions.You will need to reapply the wax every six months to a year. Which is simple to do.....just wipe some wax on whenever you take it out to clean it. Make sure the wood is dry before applying the wax.The entire piece plus slide outs is two inches deep, so the center section is not 2 inches deep, but more like 1\u00bd inches deep. That's because the slide outs slide under the center section when closed. So yes there is a depth difference in order for everything to be flush in height across the top. But it holds a lot of flatware plus extras. I have about 20 of everything plus the serving pieces and it all fits wonderfully. Even though I can only use one side of the slide outs, because my drawer is only 15 inches wide. This was the perfect solution to have a tray that fits my drawer perfectly....like a custom made tray! I love it!It is neat, clean spacious, practical and just looks so very nice.",
