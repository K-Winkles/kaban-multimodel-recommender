This set surprised me as to how well the pieces work for my daily cooking needs, clean up is a breeze and they have held up very well. They come out of the dishwasher clean and ready to go and do not fade or warp or come apart. They are great!",

                "reviewText": "I just purchased high end pots and pans atvWilliam Sonoma they have a relatively new type of non stick coating. Scan Pan is the brand, these were made specifically for WS. I was advised not to use aluminum utensils when cooking.Ok, so now to buy the utensils at WS it would have been very costly. The utensils are sold separately and although high quality the prices are $43.00/each. I kid you not, so when I read the reviews for these utensils I jumped on it. Each one is wrapped in plastic the handles are sturdy and the spatula is well made so it turns and flips with ease.The only utensil missing was tongs, so I purchased a silicone sky blue pair $17.00.Don\u2019t hesitate great value. The holder is garbage it falls over can\u2019t withstand weight of utensils. I purchased a farmhouse utensil holder from Amazon my kitchen looks beautiful.",
