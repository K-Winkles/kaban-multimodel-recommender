By angling and layering each compartment on top of each other, this utensil organizer enables you to store a full cutlery set in less than half the space of a conventional cutlery tray. Silverware can be placed inside either head or handle first, but the design also features handy icons for easy identification. Non-slip feet on the base stop the unit from sliding around in your drawer. Wash and dry by hand. Suitable for drawers with a minimum height of 3. 25 inches.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to make the most of my very small galley kitchen. Compared to my old utensil holder, this takes up about half the space. As with other Joseph and Joseph products, it's well thought out and well built. The slots are a little on the small side so you might find that you have to shuffle things around to fit all your utensils. It does take a little time to get used to not seeing what you're grabbing. I wish that there was some contrast on the embossed symbols to help make them more easily visible but this will probably mater less over time. Overall, I'm extremely happy to have an extra part of my kitchen drawers available.",

Takes up way less space in kitchen drawer. Modern & useful. I did however did end up Turning silverware with handles inside slots ...so you can see silverware easier. Don't think it matters which way you place them.",

I made that mistake and put a baking spatula in there. The handle got caught and the drawer wouldn\u2019t open lol\u2026I learned the hard way. That\u2019s not a fault in their design per se\u2026more like user error on my part.Other than that, I love it. It\u2019s super great and adds a ton more storage and organization to my drawer so I don\u2019t have to spend ages looking for stuff.",
