                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using various paper products in the Dixie Ultra line for several years, and they are by far the best in terms of sturdiness and variety. These bowls are a prime example. I use them mostly for cereal and hot oatmeal, occasionally for salad and desserts. So far, nothing has ever soaked through. I always keep a pack of them on hand as they\u2019re so useful. I also like the design: my kitchen color scheme is primarily navy blue and white, so they \u201cfit.\u201d Excellent product, excellent price. What\u2019s not to like?",

The only thing I wish was that it was in a larger pack at a better price point. Though honestly price is subjective for quality so. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
