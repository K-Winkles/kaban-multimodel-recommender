They\u2019re the perfect fit for her to use as they aren\u2019t as long as some of the other spoons we\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m also loving the fact that they came in a pack of 3, perfect for her to hold one when she\u2019s using the other to actually eat. I say you get your money\u2019s worth out of this pack as they\u2019re cute colors, and versatile (she loves them as a teether, too!). Great value for the money.",
