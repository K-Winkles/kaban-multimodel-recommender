This is a great set!It washes well, doesn\u2019t retain smells or stain because it\u2019s stainless steel, and doesn\u2019t get all scratched up from the hand washing. Overall really happy and wish I had gotten them sooner.It\u2019s a great deal and easy to bring around on the go.",

                "reviewText": "These are of course made by some no-name company, and may not exist for as long as it takes to write this review, but they are actually a good transition from large, easy-to-hold toddler utensils to standard \"grown-up\" utensils. The forks are not too pointy, and they haven't rusted after several months of use. They are a bit thin/weak compared to adult flatware -- nothing a toddler will likely notice, but still, one star off for that.",
