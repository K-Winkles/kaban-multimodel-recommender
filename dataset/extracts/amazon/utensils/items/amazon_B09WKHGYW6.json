                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars So far, worth the money - Great Value",
                "reviewText": "{ This is from Brad's wifey because he sure doesn't care! lol! }INTRO:I gave this 4 stars because(1) I only received them last week so I want to wait a bit before I give it that coveted 5th star, and(2) a few have a little roughness to them.*Also note that although this set comes with black-handed steak knives, I ordered them planning to use those as back ups/extras only . (I bought a separate set of all-stainless steel steak knives as I wanted just that silver look for my flatware. Just my preference.)PURPOSE: Why I got these....After almost 25 years of using our original Oneida Flight 18/10 silverware set, 9 kids, and serving a LOT of events... I had only a few original pieces left & the rest just a mix of whatever Wlmrt had on hand from over the many years! All my kids are of adult age now, so I wanted a whole new set but not ready to commit to an expensive brand just yet. So, I bought ONE set of 12 settings. I plan to buy another set very soon as these are great.SHIPPING:These arrived on time.DELIVERY:There was no damage to the box it came in.PACKING MATERIALS:The packaging was compact, efficient, each item was individually bagged/sleeved, and everything looked good coming out of the box/sleeves.THE FLATWARE SET:I have petite hands and these feel great in my hands even though they are not smaller than our previous 18/10 \"Flight\" silverware set from Oneida. My boys and hubby have big hands - they like the feel, too. I find them balanced, have an understated but nice look to them, have enough weight to not feel cheap but not too heavy to use for me (arthritis) either, and lay nicely when set out in a full place setting at dinner. They wash great in the dishwasher, stack beautifully in my silverware drawer (either vertically or horizontally), and look fitting next to my every day Corelle winter frost place settings AND my expensive Mikasa fine china. Not flashy, but still look great. I really appreciate that the dessert forks and teaspoons are NOT close in size to the dinner forks and dinner spoons! They are smaller and still just right. I was looking for that in a new set, and I'm so glad the sizes were true to the picture.MINUS 1/2 Star:A few pieces seem a little rough & need to be \"sanded\" -- but again, great value for the price.THE BLACK-HANDLED STEAK KNIVES OF THE SET:Oh, they feel REALLY, REALLY cheap! They just do. The black plastic handle... just doesn't cut it (pun intended!). BUT -- I KNEW THIS just by looking at them on Amazon, so no disappointment there at all. I found another set of inexpensive, solid stainless steel steak knives that is a very close match to this set's roundness at the handle and bought them in my same order. These knives ARE sharp & function absolutely fine. So there's no need for me to trash them. They'll be spares or backups. I wanted an all-silver look to my set, so again, I didn't plan to use these daily anyway. I think of them as \"bonus\" pieces.MINUS 1/2 Star:I'm also reserving a 1/2 star from my review as I'm going to wait a few more weeks to see how they hold up.FINAL THOUGHTS:I'm VERY pleased with this set! It's a GREAT value, for sure. I plan to order another set for me very soon! If you have a college student, feel confident that this set (including the steak knives!) will serve them very well. If you intend to host events or dinners in your home (or elsewhere), these are absolutely more economical to purchase instead of buying (and trashing) plastic ware sets over and over again. If you buy them with the intent to use at a baby/wedding shower, special event, etc. I would wash/dry them, stack them per item type, and use press 'n seal to keep them together perfectly tight and compact so no clattering during transport. Keep the original box for transport, too. I used the box they came in to put my old spares in and tuck away.And, even though my hubby doesn't care about having matching silverware, he did say they looked nice. WIN!",
