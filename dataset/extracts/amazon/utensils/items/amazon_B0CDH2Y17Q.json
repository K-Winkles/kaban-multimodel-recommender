They are sturdy as well, but must be washed by hand, not dishwasher. Best of all, the toddler is not able to choke as with a regular spoon or fork, because of the design of the forks and spoons. His parents loved this gift and they are used every day.",

Now getting him to keep hold versus tossing to the floor is its own challenge, lol but when he does have interest he does great bringing them to his mouth. The mouth guard so can\u2019t shove to far into his mouth is nice as some of his other utensils he\u2019ll do so with and choke himself on. The fork tines are agile enough to spear food much better than some of those plastic or silicon baby forks but dull/rounded enough that I\u2019m not too concerned when he occasionally misses his mouth with his aim.",

                "reviewText": "Love this stainless steel set of baby utensils. Easy to hold and good value. The spoon and fork are the perfect size and length for my 17 month old baby's hands to hold and self feed. A lot of utensils are too big/long and make it hard for my baby to control and get it to her mouth. My baby just started getting interested in using forks. She loves using the fork. It is small, blunt (but still sharp enough to pierce food) and the barrier makes it so she can't stick it too far into her mouth. Wish there were more colour options but it is a great set.",
