                "reviewText": "These by no means are matte black they do have a more shiny bronzy almost black finish, however they are still very dark so it work if you like black silverware. It\u2019s actually really hard to find real matte black silverware so I\u2019m keeping them they are very nice and sturdy with a great shape. One of my spoons is already scrapped up on the edges it\u2019s pretty rough all I did was put it in the dish washer so that\u2019s sad can\u2019t expect me to hand wash all my silverware",
