Thank goodness I didn't drill the holes before looking at the product again.As I looked at the bar and began to put the hooks in I realized the hooks were pointed in the wrong direction, the opening of the hooks went towards the wall. I check to see if the hooks swiveled, they don't. Then I thought maybe I bought the wrong option by mistake. Something that would hang underneath the cabinet? So I looked back at my order and at the photos of the product I purchased and realized the holes were drilled on the wrong side. I returned it and decided on a refund. Concerned I'd get another one just like it.I see that someone else's review had the same defect after the fact. So I know I'm not the only one.",
