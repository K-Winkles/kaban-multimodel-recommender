My gaze was initially drawn to the well-considered layout of the cutlery, which immediately piqued my interest. My kitchen has been given a contemporary and elegant aspect thanks to the grey color scheme, which also allows it to mix well with any kind of decoration. The smooth silicone heads provide a lovely contrast to the organic feel of the oak handles, which have a warm and natural appearance. It's reasonable to say that this set is aesthetically pleasing in addition to being functional in its design. When it comes to functionality, these tools are top-notch in every aspect of the kitchen. The silicone heads have exceptional resistance to heat, which allows them to tolerate temperatures that are quite high without distorting or melting. These tools have shown their worth in the kitchen by accomplishing tasks such as turning pancakes and stirring sauces. As a result of the soft and pliable quality of the silicone material, I no longer have to be concerned about my cookware being scratched.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros- First of all I love that this set came with so many things, basically anything you could possibly need to cook all right there in one neat set. They are the perfect length, I\u2019m not crazy about super long utensils as they feel clumsy or if too short you feel like your hand is burning off. They are angled perfectly making it easier to manage then a straight utensil. I like that the measuring spoons and cups have the writing imprinted opposed to painted as the paint eventually wears off (note these are plastic, not silicone). Also, I love the large spatula it came with, I found a lot of sets don\u2019t come with one that size. Food does not stick to them making it a breeze to cook with especially with my T-fal cookware.Cons- some of the utensils are a little on the small side. The first time I used the spoon, I was browning rice and the silicone began to bubble up, I pushed it back down while it was still warm but there is still a little spot that is detached from the metal underneath as I showed in my video. The smaller spatula came apart after only a few uses, it felt a little loose in the first place maybe soaking it in dishwater wasn\u2019t the greatest idea, it could have been that, but you would think you should be able to soak your utensils. Lastly if you are going to get them in black they need to be dried after washing if you don\u2019t want water spots in them.Final thoughts- I looked at a lot of these sets and read a ton of reviews and found this one was going to be the best bet for me. The issues I had so far are minor, I\u2019m still overall happy with this purchase.",
