                "reviewText": "I don't know that the cards/magnetic cover add anything to this. The magnets are hidden (mounted from the inside), so if you don't want to use that part, no one would ever know. I guess it could be fine if you want to slide some decorative card behind the acrylic plate to add some color to your countertop display, but a greeting card? Seems odd.Anyway, this is a good quality, wooden utensil organizer. I finally got tired of digging through my utensil drawer to find these things, and figured it'd save precious drawer space by putting them on the counter instead. It won't fit everything (some things are just not sized well), but it holds a LOT. If you have a pared-down sample of cooking utensils, then you might be able to use the other spaces for serving utensils and/or tableware utensils.I particularly like how much it holds, and that it's big enough to remain stable. It's not heavy, so you can still tip it over easily if you don't pull something out completely. Otherwise, this is a simple, attractive design that should be at home on most countertops. Enjoy!",

It\u2019s a definite improvement to have dedicated spots for spoons, spatulas, and tongs. I used to have every utensil stuffed in a large vase and would have to dig out half of them to find what I was looking for, but now I know exactly where to look to find what I need in that critical cooking moment. In hindsight, it\u2019s a long overdue improvement to my kitchen that really helps make cooking more efficient and pleasant! I did notice an unpleasant odor when I first unboxed this, so I let it air out for a few days before using it, and that seems to have done the trick.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really like this kitchen utensil holder. I love the wood grain on it - it\u2019s just beautiful. The craftsmanship is very well done and the material is great quality.The cards that come with it can be written on to say whatever you want them to. There\u2019s a plastic plate they go on that has magnets on it and sticks right on the side of the utensil holder. I\u2019m not sure how the signs are supposed to stick to the plastic plate as it didn\u2019t come with any adhesive stickers or anything like that so I\u2019m guessing you would just use glue or tape. What I appreciate about the magnetic plate and varying signs is that it can be customized to however you like and the message you write on it is personal and custom. I also really appreciate that this is an optional feature rather than coming as a permanent one. All his makes this item very customizable and versatile.",

I like the wood I like the constructions of very smooth and nice finish I also like the magnets with the insert where you can actually put notes or recipes to watch and look at while you work",
