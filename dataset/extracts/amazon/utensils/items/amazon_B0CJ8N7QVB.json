I'm happy to have them. Pay attention to the instructions. Do not use lemon or citrus soaps, it will mess them up. I use free and clear dish soap, hand wash and throughly dry them right away. I think I'll have these for a long time. Nice weight on them, I'm pleased as punch. I've used them daily for over 6 months and not 1 issue.",
