                "reviewText": "This is a generous pack of cuterly. I wasn't sure how the quality would be since these are compostable, but to my surprise they are sturdier than any other disposable cuterly I have ever tried. Usually the knives I use break with the smallest pressure, but these cut through all my food without issue. They are a nice white color, are extremely durable and I feel great that I'm not filling up the landfills once I'm done. They also have a better feel than the plastic ones, I wouldn't be embarrassed to put these out at a party unlike some other cutlery I have purchased in the past. I will definitely use these for my big parties, desserts, picnics and lunches on the go. What a great product. I will be a repeat customer.",

                "reviewText": "Disposable cutlery is often flimsy - forks that break easily, spoons with edges that cut your lip, and worthless knives. I was very excited to discover this guilt-free cutlery set, but I was worried that \"compostable\" would also mean flimsy. Not only do these NOT disappoint, but it's the best disposable cutlery I remember using in a long time. The edges are smooth, the spoons are a nice width/depth, and the items are very sturdy. It really is hard to believe they're 100% biodegradable. Their only weakness seems to be some sensitivity to heat. If I dive into a very hot meal (like too hot to put in my mouth without blowing on it), the cutlery sometimes bends/melts/changes shape a bit, but still not disruptive enough to require a replacement imo.",

                "reviewText": "Hi All,These are much better than what I have been using in the past. I tried Bamboo, recycled paper/wood, plastic and what not. These are really good. They far surpassed the wood products, and are so much sturdier than any cheap plastic. The more expensive plastic flatware is just as good as these but you pay extra for the better quality. These also have a unique feel to them. It is difficult to describe, so I'll have to leave that part as, not like a plastic feel.They could be a little longer in the handles. This aspect of the product falls into the cheap plastic category.Once again, the more expensive plastic tableware covers that issue and once again, you pay the premium for it.Overall, much better than cheap plastic and ANY wood product, not quite up to the more expensive plastic tableware out there.Perfect for Dinner on the back porch, a picnic in the park or at the beach.Not meant for an outdoor wedding or formal social gathering.-Ron",

It is very important to me when hosting an event where I produce \u201cwaste\u201d to communicate to the public that I\u2019m doing it in a sustainable way. Most products have been a disappointment, due to their poor quality where they break or just can\u2019t pick up food. Wooden spoons leave that funny taste in your mouth (remember small ice cream paddles taste).I\u2019ve now ordered and re-ordered from Ecovita and was compelled to write a positive review. Very sturdy quality, no smell and stamped right on every utensil is the word \u201c100% Compostable\u201d. I get my proper marketing message out, the forks pick up everything and knives cut a steak! A customer asked me for a few so that they could take camping (good idea). Box came with 380 pieces so I was happy to accommodate. I\u2019ve tried many \u2013 but these are best in the market.",
