                "reviewText": "We are loyal munchkin customers so when it was time for our toddler to start using utensils, we tried these first! These are by far the best for the main reason that it is all one piece so it\u2019s easy to clean/throw in the dishwasher. We did end up trying a few other brands and hated them all because you would have to take the silicon handle off to clean but not these! It\u2019s also nice it has the little stopper so baby doesn\u2019t shove the utensil down his throat! The handle is the perfect length for baby\u2019s hand too, not too short like most other brands. All in all, I highly recommend!",
