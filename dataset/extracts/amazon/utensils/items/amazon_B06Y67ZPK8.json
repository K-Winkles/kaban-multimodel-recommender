But, when you hold it in your hand, it's a tad on the lightweight side, I would have preferred the metal was slightly thicker, so it has a little more presence when you use it. It's just a little too thin for my tastes. There are some flatware sets that are awfully thick, too thick to even handle well during use. Those are too thick so this set is better than that situation.",
