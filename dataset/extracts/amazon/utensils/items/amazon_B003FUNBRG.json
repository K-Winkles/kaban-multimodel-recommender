Home composting is not recommended and it may take 1-2 years to compost in a home composting system. Most current utensils on the market made from plant starch are not compostable since current technology does not allow for manufacturing plant starch utensils without adding some plastic fillers. Since these plant starch utensils do not meet compostability standards they are normally priced cheaper. Our utensils are made from tpla (70% Non-GMO pla and 30% talc.) They are also heat resistant up to 200 degrees f, and are certified under astm-6400 standards and now have bpi certification. Includes one 24 count of World Centric compostable assorted utensil. A different kind of product from a different kind of company.",

                "reviewText": "These are awesome. I feel guilty using unrecyclable disposable plastic (petrochemical) cutlery, cups, etc., but these are fully compostable!*Easily distinguishable from other disposable cutlery due to the loop in the handle. Surprisingly strong, Strangely elegant, classy. No burrs or barbs like on typical plastics. Good price point. Highly recommend.This company has a lot of other items too and I am excited. Even lazy as I am, not wanting to wash dishes, plastic waste is still a luxury with severe negative consequences we can no longer afford. But these are guilt free!*UpdateI was saddened to learn that not all \"compostable\" packaging and cutlery actually breaks down in every industrial or home composting operation and that not all city yard waste services will accept hard commercial \"compostables\" for pickup, according to investigative reporting. The packaging states these maintain their integrity up to 200 degrees F so it would seem that a minimum temperature is required to break them down into compost. Best to follow local municipal guidelines. I am fortunate that Seattle has a huge and successful large scale composting operation that does take all kinds of food service packaging products.",

                "reviewText": "I probably will sound a bit strange, but I really love these disposable utensils. So much so, that I reuse them over and over and have also purchased several sets.These are great because:- The spoons scoop up just the perfect amount of food for toddler and adult alike. I dislike most toddler utensils because the spoons barely hold anything to constitute as \"food\". I love these because they are the perfect size for tasting spoons for when I cook. This leaves my real silverware for setting the table.- The forks are great because (again) it actually holds food onto it without the ends being super sharp, which is super important for me as a parent. Again, I dislike most toddler forks because they often barely hold any food or don't have enough depth to pierce the food. These forks minimize the mess on the floor at mealtimes.- The knives (even) are great. They have a great strength without it being long / thick. And most grocery stores carry \u00fcber expensive (e.g., \"diamond weight\") disposable utensils or super cheap utensils that are just as useless as toddler silverware.These utensils by World Centric are so great - PLUS, they are environmentally friendly. I use these till they drop (er, break - as a few of my spoons have snapped), but I love them so much that I use them for \"scoops\" for my instant coffee, sugar, etc.I know, I sound weird for gushing about disposable 'ware, but try these and you will not go back!",
