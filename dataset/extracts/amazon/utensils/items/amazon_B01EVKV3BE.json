Despite this small flaw, I liked the set enough that I went ahead and ordered 4 more sets for my husband and kids' lunchboxes. All had this same flaw, but it's fine since none of us need the knife.",

                "reviewText": "I took off 2 stars because the case (which is sturdy and has a perfect roundish compact size) won't close as other reviews mentioned. It is almost impossible to keep closed even if you remove the spoon (the problem is the latch won't stay). So if you are cool with it, just use a rubber elastic band around to hold it if you don't want the cutlery all over the place in your bag. Otherwise it's a good price-quality item and quite modern/elegant for lunchbag accesories. The cutlery is nice, the knife is rounded (perfect for people that have security scanners at the workplace). I would buy these again (even with the problematic latch).",

I like how the case keeps the utensils elevated so I don\u2019t feel like I need to wash the case every time I use it. I put the utensils inside in the order of fork, spoon, then knife on top and I\u2019ve had no issues with closing the case like some reviews mentioned. It fits nicely in my Packit lunch bag. All in all a great buy and much cheaper than the Oxo one I originally looked at.",

The case provides a nice secure place to keep the flatware in 1 place and you don't have to worry about the fork or knife puncturing anything. Great product.
