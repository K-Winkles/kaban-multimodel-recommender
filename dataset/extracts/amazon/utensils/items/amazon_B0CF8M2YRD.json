It\u2019s shockingly high quality!! I\u2019m honestly shocked. My son just moved into an apartment and I needed to get him some utensils\u2026 I sent him with a couple of mine and thought I would just buy him his own full set\u2026. I really wasn\u2019t expecting much, it\u2019s a complete set for $25. I didn\u2019t know what I could possibly even be expecting. It\u2019s really nice!!!!! The metal holder is sturdy not thin and flexible. The pieces all fit nicely in it without being tight or constricted yet it takes up very little room on the counter. The rubber is thick and quality feeling? It\u2019s hard to explain. It feels sturdy. The handles are comfortable to hold and use. it comes with any instrument I could think of! lol.I\u2019m really just shocked. I did not expect it to be this nice. Honestly, it\u2019s much nicer than all of my kitchen tools! It\u2019s actually really nice to have a set that\u2019s all the same style/color versus my mismatched tools!Seriously just buy it. You won\u2019t be disappointed!",
