I am going to return it only bc the cooks in my house insist on having every utensil in a countertop crock and I need a bigger one. I have no complaints- it\u2019s very pretty, nice weight and I like the contrast of the ceramic and wood. If you\u2019re going to put fewer than 10 spatulas, spoons, tongs etc in it, it should be fine.",
