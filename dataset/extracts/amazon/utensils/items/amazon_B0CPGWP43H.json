                "reviewText": "I was concerned that this set of \"disposable\" serving utensils would be cheap looking, badly performing, or too small. Fortunately, none of these concerns are true. The set includes six each of serving spoons, serving forks, and tongs. The sizes are decent and the plastic is thick and sturdy. They're marketed as disposable, but they are certainly reusable a number of times.The black gloss/matte finish looks good on the serving tray.The tongs are perhaps the least of the set, as they're a bit more flimsy than the other utensils and the teeth align with each other rather than mesh together. As a result, it might be a little tricky to pick up thin things like a leaf of lettuce, but they're perfectly good for picking up chunkier things like fruits and vegetables.",

                "reviewText": "This set of disposable serveware contains an adequate amount of spoons, forks, and tongs. That's a plus.The quality is mediocre, but it is also the same as other disposable serveware sets. So, it's not better or worse than others I've used previously. That too is a plus.The forks and spoons are a bit more sturdy than are the tongs - which are crap. The tongs are flimsy and don't work very well to pick up lunchmeat or pickles, as the grip isn't great and they don't close except with a bit of force.They may work better for salad or lettuce, but I didn't try that out because I didn't put any out this year for Christmas lunch.The spoons and forks seemed to work somewhat well for casserole, provisionally that the spoon was not overloaded. I was unsure if the spoon would crack under pressure so it was decided to forego its use and simply use a cooking spatula for the casserole. The spoons/forks may be better suited for lighter foods - like pasta and fruit salads.I don't love these, but I don't hate them either. As mentioned, their quality is about the same as most disposable serveware sets. I plan to reuse them for future get-together events so I gave this product three stars.",
