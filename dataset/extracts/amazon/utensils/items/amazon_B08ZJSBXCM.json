Still I'm able to get a large number of cooking utensils inside. I wish it was just a little wider. The dimensions are accurate but until i got it I really wasn't sure how much it would hold. I'm satisfied but I did buy another container at Walmart for the additional tools I couldn't fit.",

                "reviewText": "I really don\u2019t have anything bad to say about these. I ordered three, but ended up needing only two\u2026 because they work even better than I was anticipating. And I put A LOT of cooking utensils in them, along with two knives which were too long for our knives drawer. If you use the quarter compartments for the taller stuff, it helps to keep everything more vertical and in its place (it doesn\u2019t look as messy and items don\u2019t end up pushing over to another compartment). I was worried that the base wouldn\u2019t be weighted enough; but, even though it feels light, it isn\u2019t unstable at all - even when spinning around. I initially thought these were a little pricy, but now I think they\u2019re a good value for how well they look and perform. I\u2019m even going to keep the extra. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find another use for it. It seems like this organization tool would be very versatile.",
