I did a lot of research before I chose this gold cutlery set a few factors in deciding where, of course budget first, this was a great price and then I loved that it was satin finish and not shiny. When they arrived, they were well packed and I was happy to see how elegant they are! I am also happy to see that they aren\u2019t super sharp or have raspy barbs of metal as some cutlery sets have sharp edges on spoons and fork tines. The only thing that is sharp Are these nice little butter knives that could help cut your food at dinner, I found sometimes I don\u2019t reach for a Steaknife because these do the job.The only downside is when I go to wash them because of the thin, elegant ends of the handles. They slip through my dishwasher basket down a little too low so that I can\u2019t slide my dishwasher drawer in this is solved by placing them in the utensil basket upside down. Problem solved and I am happy!Only time will tell on how long the gold finish lasts. I\u2019m not going easy on them because I need to live my life, so will update that in the future!",
