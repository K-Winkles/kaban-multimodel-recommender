The mouth part of the spoons are also square-ish in shape, which is GREAT for squeegee-ing baby food out of the bowl or off the babies face. The forks I haven't even tried yet... Probably gonna be too flexible to even poke most things, but the price for these 3 spoons is cheaper than other packs of 2 so... Worth it even if the forks are useless.",
