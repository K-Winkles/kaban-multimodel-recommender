The color white is like a vanilla white and perfect to coordinate with most kitchen decor.

I came across this and loved that they\u2019re all one piece with the exception of the tongs and mixer. Easy to clean, heat resistant, and dishwasher safe. The little container seems cheaply made just basic plastic but it was nice to have.They are lighter than my original tools but still in theme.Great purchase especially for the price, I\u2019d recommend!",
