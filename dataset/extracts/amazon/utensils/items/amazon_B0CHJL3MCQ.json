                "reviewText": "Overall this is a good utensil holder, but there are a few things that keep it from being great. The ceramic holder is sturdy and the base looks to be bamboo so a nice sustainable wood. The holder is huge and high, so there shouldn't be a problem storing lots of utensils. There are two issues that I have with this item. The first is the base slides on the countertop when I turn it. Yes, felt or rubber feet will prevent this, but would be nice to come with. Also, the holder is noticeably smaller than the base so it slides a bit when you turn it. The base does not turn very freely, either. Overall it's nice, but could be a little better made.",
