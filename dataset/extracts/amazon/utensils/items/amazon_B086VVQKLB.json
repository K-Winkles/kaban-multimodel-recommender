                "reviewText": "This item is awesome at organizing chaotic drawers. Most flatware organizers move around inside oversided drawers but this stays put. There are lots of sections to put the different types of flatware or whatever you want to keep separate.Once installed it is pretty darn sturdy. But getting it can often be problematic.This is the 2nd one of these I ordered. The first I had to send back because it was broken at the corner. It was sent with just a label slapped on the outside of the item's display box. There is no protection inside the display box. So I returned it.The second one one I bought \"like new\" because the price had increased. It arrived in an Amazon shipping box with plenty of protection. But once I unpacked it and got it lined up to go into the drawer, I noticed a line that ran the length of the back panel on one side. The wood is split clear-throughlike the corner break the first one had, this didn't make it unusable, and since I'd been waiting 2 weeks from the day I ordered the first one, I decided to keep it.It is clear this is the reason the item was originally returned to Amazon - I have included a photo of the 2nd item's display box. You can clearly see the shipping label from the first buyer - once again shipped without any actual protection.These drawer organizers are sturdy --- in the drawer. but few things are sturdy enough to endure holiday period package processing & delivery without protection. Thes display box alone just doesn't provide any.",

The depth of most of the individual flatware sections is only about 1-1/8\", not deep enough to comfortably hold all of our flatware. Just wish they would have been a little more generous with the depth. Otherwise, nice.",
