                "reviewText": "I use this on my counter for a utensil holder. I often wash my dishes and put them away before they are fully dry and I love this because of the open design. I have had the occasional spoon slip out of a gap in the metal but typically I use it for larger cooking utensils anyway. I like that it spins and is easy to reach the tool I want when cooking. I recommend this product.",
