I didn\u2019t realize that until I see the container keeps dripping water, so I started to wonder where the water came from, as everywhere looked dry. Finally I found the answer when I opened the bottom of the container. As you can see from the picture, there\u2019s some space in between, where water can easily get in through the edge when you wash the container, but hard to come out. I\u2019m not sure why the container is designed in this way. Maybe we are not expected to wash the container? But then how do you clean it, after you put in the dirty utensils after meal? I tried to wipe clean but not always working, especially when it got oily. That\u2019s my only complaint. Other than that, it\u2019s a good product.",

I use it a handful of times when I visit my boyfriend\u2019s workplace to eat ramen with him. It was easy to clean, but it can be annoying to rearrange them because they will not fill close if you don\u2019t put the utensil how it originally was in the case. I mainly bought it because there were little to no negative reviews about the color part was not scratch off. My utensil have not been scratch up or shown peeling off. I mainly got it because of the chopstick and the case. I like a good sturdy case, and I prefer using chopsticks than any other utensils. I bought so I know the different between the normal house utensil and my travel utensil. It can be a little pricey, but I have no problem with it so far, and it did not peel or scratch off.",
