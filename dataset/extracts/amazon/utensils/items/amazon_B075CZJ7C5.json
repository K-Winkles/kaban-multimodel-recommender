                "reviewText": "The first fork I used snapped when I tried to slice the day-after-Christmas Stovetop Stuffing using the edge of the fork. (I know, Stovetop Stuffing for Christmas!!! I hate to cook!) It had worked fine when I was stabbing stuffing already cut with a knife, but a larger, congealed, room-temperature piece of stuffing was a little too much for the fork. Structurally, I suspect stabbing uses the whole fork while slicing with the side puts too much pressure on the bends near the tines (which is where it broke). I'm going to grab a knife if I think I'll need to cut anything thicker than canned cranberry sauce. You decide if it's worth the price to purchase.",
