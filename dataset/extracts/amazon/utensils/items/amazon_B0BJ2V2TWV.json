                "reviewText": "I recently got this set of 150 Premium Grade Compostable Cutlery by ECO SOUL which is 100% Eco friendly, disposable cutlery, and I am very happy with it. The set of 150 utensils included 50 forks, 50 spoons, and 50 Knives. They advertise to be microwave & oven safe, so it is nice to know that they won't disintegrate when in contact with hot food. I like how sturdy they are and have been using them a lot this past month. You can't really tell that they aren't regular plastic just from looking at them but I feel much better about using these instead of plastic ones.",

                "reviewText": "Received for free through the vine program, but I'm reviewing this honestly as if I had purchased it.Pros: - Very sturdy, these actually compare favorably even to premium plastic cutlery. - Not flexible, which makes it far easier to cut/break up food with these, as compared to most disposable cutlery. - If a fork breaks (never happened during use, only when I tested it with force) the break always happened at the neck of the fork, between the handle and the fork. This means no worries about having small tines in your food if it does somehow break.Cons: - The bottom ridges can be mildly uncomfortable to hold.Overall we were very pleased with these, and will definitely consider getting more from this brand in the future. Yes, they're more expensive than most plasticware, but among compostable stuff the price is very reasonable and the quality is solid.Disclaimer: I have not tested how compostable these are, but given their makeup seems in line with other compostable cutlery I'm accepting the manufacturer's claims here.",

                "reviewText": "I had the opportunity to try out the ECO SOUL Compostable Cutlery Set and I must say, they\u2019re worth giving a go. The fact that these utensils are 100% eco-friendly and compostable is a huge plus for me, as I'm always looking for ways to reduce my environmental impact. The combo pack of 150 strong and durable utensils is also a big selling point - I love that I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.In terms of the feel and durability, these utensils are surprisingly similar to regular plastic utensils. They have a sturdy and solid feel in my hand, and I can use them to eat a variety of foods without worrying about them breaking or bending. However, one thing to note is that they don't hold up well to heat. I found that they tend to melt when I use them for hot drinks like soup or hot chocolate, which is a bit of a downside. But aside from that, I really can't complain about these utensils.I recommend the ECO SOUL Compostable Cutlery Set to anyone who is looking for an eco-friendly and convenient alternative to traditional plastic utensils. They're durable, plentiful, and feel just like regular plastic utensils. Just be aware that they don't hold up well to heat.",
