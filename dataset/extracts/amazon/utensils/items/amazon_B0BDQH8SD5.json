I took every part off and laid them on the table. This was the only tool I needed. From hex keys, to Philips/flatheads, I was not lacking. I was surprised by the sturdiness of the tool. I've had cheap hex key multi-tools from Lowes before that broke after a single use; but this tool allowed me to apply as much torque (tightened by hand) at whatever funky angle required without breaking.The only downside is the difficulty to handle while torquing a bolt with the tool; but it's expected with a multitool like this.It's surprisingly small and powerful. Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This is definitely one of the better pocket utensil sets out there. The Knife is sharp, feels sturdy and locks. The spoon is a good size and folds up perfectly. Fork is a bit on the small side, but it gets the job done, is removable and locks. Plenty of other tools in the set that are very usefull. Used it 2 times a day for 2 weeks during an extended camping trip and no problems, no rust or discoloration from heat, everything still snaps together perfectly and all the locks still function. (the blade and fork locks are a spring retention system with a groove and a nub that fits into it. This sytem functions great, but excess pressure can release it, so be mindful of that). Recommended, would purchase again!",
