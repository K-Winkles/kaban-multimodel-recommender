I can keep my shoes and my 9 y/o shoes on this shoe rack but that's it and my husband's shoes sit on the side. If you are wanting this for small shoes, it's a good item but the metal rods are not very sturdy and came to me slightly bent already.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this product does exactly what we needed. We have a small entry space by the kitchen so we needed a solution for storing our shoes. This product did exactly that. Assembly was super quick and easy. (Be careful when putting the metal tubes in. We pushed too hard on one and cracked part of the plastic on one side). In terms of sturdiness, it works for the types of shoes we are putting on it. We have women's shoes on it like tennis shoes, flats and flip flops and it holds just fine. For the price, it is a good enough product.",

As you can see it holds two pairs of my shoes on each shelf. Yes, it's plastic on the sides, and not really very beautiful. But in my case, I didn't care, I just wanted something small and convenient! This old lady had no trouble assembling it - although I had to borrow my husband's soft mallet to tap things into place and make it sturdy as suggested in the instructions. I don't think it even took me 10 minutes to put together.",
