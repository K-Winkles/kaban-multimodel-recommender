                "reviewText": "This shoe rack is wonderful. It gives just enough space to hold all of my sons shoes. It also fit perfectly under his bed in his dorm. The platforms look really nice and feel very sturdy, and not hollow, like some products. The black color of the pillars go very well with the \"Dark Cherry\" platforms. They do feel rather cheep though. But this is a shoe rack, not a stepping stool, so it doesn't matter how cheep the pillars are. The rack was incredibly easy for my son to assemble. It took him roughly 2 minutes or less, And the best part, no tools needed! You just screw stuff together with your hands! I would definitely suggest this product to anyone looking to buy a small, but not too small, shoe rack.",

But it seems like it will definitely hold 9-10 pairs of shoes and it matched our entryway/kitchen of cherry wood and black appliances. It looks great from a distance and your getting a little more than you pay for (but not by much). Bought it because it fit the weird dimensions we needed.",
