                "reviewText": "I just finished putting this together and once together, it is sturdy and has alot of room for adjustability.The instructions were clear and easy to follow, it was well packaged in heavy corrugated cardboard.Very simple assembly, the instructions are easy to follow, the only thing to pay attention to is the shelf middle pieces are slightly different than the end pieces. If you are tying to put it together (without reading the instructions lol), and the shelf pieces won't fit together, you probably have the wrong piece.The pieces fit together with a nice friction 'interference' fit, so they require a little light banging or tapping to get them to fully seat.Once together, it is very sturdy and solid. I picked up the 45\" long, three shelf version, and you can select different levels for the shelves when you assemble it. I deviated slightly from the instructions because I wanted the bottom shelf in the lowest set of holes so I have an extra 'tall' shelf space for the lower for boots and things.It went together easy - about 15 minutes and seems to be a good quality item.",

Closets and shoes tend to provide overlooked targets.PROS:- easy setup- decent materials, support plenty of weight, although a bit flimsy- easily fits 10 pairs of men's shoes (glad that all I have!)- allows bottom shelf to be raised to provide extra floor storage - IF clothes hanging above allow clearance- I can now see and find the pair I'm looking for with easeCONS:- delivered with broken spoke on one shelf (doesn't affect shoe storage, but may catch on them or garments hanging above)- does not handle 12 pairs of shoes as advertised (at least not size 12 men's shoes)- would be nice to allow width adjustment- shelf height adjustment takes time, requiring shoe removal, unscrewing shelves, moving shelves and refastening them",

                "reviewText": "This was easy to set up, and I like how it's metal rather than particle board like my old one that broke. It's long enough to fit several pairs!The only change I would make to it is an increase in depth. I was aware the depth was 11 in. when I received the shelf, but now that it's set up I see how some shoes do overhang a bit (the largest shoes on here are women's size 9). So maybe a 14 in. depth would be better, especially to fit men's shoes. But then again, those could go at the bottom on the floor.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a shoe rack that was short to not come up past my hanging clothes. So only two tiers works best for me. Most shoe racks are at least three. In putting it together, there are only four screws. That means that the only thing that holds the middle section together is the very small space on the rods that slip together. It took me awhile to do since they kept slipping apart. Once done, I carefully carried it to my closet. So far, so good. It seems to be holding steady.it comes with some small clips to place on the ends, but I didn\u2019t bother to attach them, I can\u2019t imagine having a use for them. It\u2019s nice to get my shoes up off the floor!",

Just slide the outer racks onto the middle rack and screw the sides on. TIP: The instructions tell you to assemble the rack and install the legs. Installing the legs first and then assembling the rack is much easier. I'll be getting more of these for my other closets.",

                "reviewText": "The rack overall isn't too bad. The powder coating on the parts seems to be of good quality and should handle wear and tear pretty well. I also appreciated the ability to adjust the height of the shelves. But a couple things that knock a star off-- first, the horizontal part of the rack doesn't fit together super well. A couple pieces required some effort to put together and a couple of them feel a little too loose. These need to be manufactured to better tolerances and will probably need some sort of fasterner to ensure the joints don't slip apart. I also have to nitpick that the brand sticker was haphazardly was stuck onto a rail. It looked terrible, and then the sticker wasn't made for easy removal which meant a sticky mess. Again, overall not bad and worth a look.",
