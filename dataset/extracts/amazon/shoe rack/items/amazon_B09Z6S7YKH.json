                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting the sturdiness to be as good as it was cause of the price point. Shocked a bit how well it was acctually, still looks great! I love it it helps our entrie look so much better. It came with two hooks as well, say to put one on each side (maybe so the weight isn't to heavy on one side). But we put both on one side and just used them for light weight stuff. A nice little bonus. I had a hard time picking how many shelves I wanted at first, until I noticed this one had the option to slant the lower shelves or not. I choose to slant all but the first one use that to hold random stuff. The top shelf wood is nice for photos or a plant. I was a little disappointed that the wood is two pieces not just one big one. They didnt line up as good but you wont notice unless you built it or it was pointed out. So not a huge deal. The rest shelves I have our shoes on and cleared up the clutter by the front door. We love it!! Thank you! (tried to post a picture but wont accept the pic)",

The height of the rack allows for alot of shoe storage. One of the adjustable shelves even lets me store boots. It does take a little time to put together as it has alot of small pieces and components. It is worth the effort because it will fit neatly in most small areas, still hold a decent amount of shoes and looks very stylish. Very good buy, can't ask for much else.",
