The shelves are basically a sheet of fabric that is probably some kind of manufactured plastic material that has a linen texture. I got a white one. Uncertain how washable it would be. I can see how it would get easily soiled, and difficult to clean from holding shoes. Uncertain if I would recommend white for shoes because of this, if having it look pristine white is important.",

You can piece it together in a short amount of time using the instructions, which are quite clear and simple. You don\u2019t need any tools at all (apart from something to open the box). It is spacious enough to hold two adult pairs of shoes per shelf as well as two beneath it, which is why it is considered four tiers even though there are only three shelves. The rack looks cute and clean and it is very sturdy despite its small size and simple materials. I am quite happy with it and I would recommend it!",

And assembly is extremely easy. It\u2019s very lightweight as the shelves are made from fabric.I would note that the height of the rows aren\u2019t as high as they are photoshopped in the listing photos. I would not be able to put high heels under on the floor level as the picture shows it, but it will definitely hold a variety of shoe types and sizes to keep you organized.Nice little organizing rack.",

Now all you need is your family to cooperate and use it!However, it's not gonna look pretty or cool. Fairly certain my child put this together properly (very easy but the directions given did not match the product), yet the fabric is more like baskets on this one than the other reviewers photos. Not a big deal, I guess?This rack would work best in a closet, hidden away, if possible. Kids shoes fit best, but men's shoes not so much, they look silly - but does it help with that pile of shoes? Yes!",

They both twisted inwards. I couldn't even set the rest up.I've had way better shoe racks, that require less work, less assembly and accurately describes the tiers. This product is bad.",
