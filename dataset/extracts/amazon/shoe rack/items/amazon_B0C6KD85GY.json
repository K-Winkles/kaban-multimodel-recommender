                "reviewText": "My wife and I read a LOT of reviews here for shoe racks. She wanted something for 20 pairs of her shoes. (Beware those racks using fabric; too many complaining about it ripping.) This rack had the slightly extended front legs for stability that no others have. It's all metal except for the two top boards. Everything went together nicely, only one screw that was harder to put in. It's strong, well braced, and ours didn't have to be tethered to the wall to prevent tip-over. (But we have no cats or little kiddies to pull it over.)This get a rare 5 star recommendation from me, and I'm pretty picky.",

                "reviewText": "We are a \"shoes off at the door\" family and usually put our shoes in one of those flat cabinets with the doors that open at an angle. The problem is that the angled drawers don't hold that many shoes and it was getting really messy around the cabinet with extra shoes piling up. This shoe organizer is perfect for our entryway. It is really easy to assemble, there is enough shelf space for everyone's shoes to get put away neatly, and the wood top is great to have catch-all bins for everyone's small items. The only critique I have is that there is a little bit of a wobble since the shelves are wire metal, but it still is nothing that detracts from the look and quality. I did not use the little wall straps either so that's on me. Overall, I am really happy with the amount of shoes this holds and how nice it looks at the entryway.",
