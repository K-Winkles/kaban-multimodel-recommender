I liked that this was brown as it does blend well with the cherry wood entrance table it is under. Fully extended, it is the perfect size and it was easy to put together.I do like that it is metal, though I wish the tubing was a little thicker. Fully extended, it still holds well, but I do worry about long time stability, especially if some of my rooms \"throw\" their shoes on it vs. place them.Still for the price, it is a good shoe rack, especially if you need a unique size!",

It is convenient, because you can put your most- worn shoes in one centralised location.",
