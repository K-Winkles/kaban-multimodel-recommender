                "reviewText": "The shelves on this have a bit more tilt in real life they do in the ad; however, there's always the very real chance that I put it together wrong! But as far as I am concerned the angle is good, because the shoes stay put as long as the stand is right up against the wall. It's easy enough to put together. They say you don't need tools, although I did need a wrench to tighten down the last of the attaching screws. That one just did not want to seat. It's not an expensive piece and it doesn't look like one, but it's not bad, either. Once you finally get everything really tightened down it's surprisingly sturdy. Just make sure to really twist the connectors down as hard as you can without breaking them. I wouldn't put six pairs of heavy hiking boots on the top. It's, again, not an expensive piece! But regular sneakers and shoes are fine. Each shelf holds between three and four pairs of shoes, depending of course on how big they are. It's about 29 inches across by about 14 inches high fully extended, but you can set it as short as 14 and a bit inches across if you prefer. It does not adjust to be taller or shorter. And the little black caps that go on the ends do keep it fairly well in place. Be a bit careful putting those on, though. The edges of the metal tubes are sharp. Not bad for the price! Not bad at all.",

                "reviewText": "For storing kids/women's shoes, this is a pretty nice product. It fits things like sneakers, sandals/slides pretty well, but this will not work for a lot of larger men's size shoes or boots. You can fit some larger shoes up top, but they're not going to fit in any lower shelves, so keep that in mind if you are buying multiple in the hopes of stacking them.In terms of build quality, it's pretty solid, and only takes about 3-5 minutes to put together. I have mine extended to the longest length, and it doesn't wobble around too much or feel too weak in the middle, so that's nice. I think this product is at a pretty reasonable price point too for what you get!",
