                "reviewText": "The shelf came decently packaged. There was no bag to hold the 34 screws, so they were scattered all around the packaging. There were 35 total screws included with this order. Ease of putting together was nice. I was able to put it together in about 30 minutes. A couple of the holes for the screws did not poke all the way through, however the Allen wrench that was provided was able to fix that problem pretty quickly by just sticking it through the holes with some force. One side of the rack had one screw hole that did not have the screw seat to screw into, so it just wobbles in the hole, but I am still able to keep the rack secure enough for use. End product looks great, and I really like the wooden top. I am satisfied!",

Small children will be using it and I'm not worried about it tipping over from normal use. The adjustable feet were important because it was wobbly when we first assembled it. Not sure if that's because of the floor or the product. But it was leveled out and now it's great. I recommend it.",
