BTW, assembly is very simple and took about 15 minutes at most - thread few rods, screw few bolts, done. No extra tools required (a hex wrench is included).The material is strong and dense, and appears pretty tear-resistant. The organizer itself is quite large and spacious. Definitely has more capacity compared to my current shoe shelf. If necessary, two of them can be stacked together either side by side, or even on top of each other (the necessary fastening bolts are included).Overall, would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an organizer to go inside of my coat closet to house all of our shoes. After measuring, this seemed to fit perfectly. It arrived in a small box which made me nervous but every piece was there (some extra hardware was included). You even get the small wrenches you need so you won't need anything at all from your own toolbox. There also is hardware included to use if stacking two sets together. My 8 year old son took the lead in putting this together and we were able to have it together and in the closet in about 20 minutes. I absolutely love it! If you have a lot of boots or taller shoes, this won't be the greatest organizer (although still doable for most, it'll be a tight squeeze). There is a somewhat functional top where you could place a few things but it isn't strong enough for a storage basket or anything like that. Right now I put my kids' hats on it. I would definitely buy this again!",
