I can easily place all kinds of shoes from crocs, trainers, and mid-top hikers. Many options before discovering this product are usually horizontal designs, which would take up a lot of space I do not have. I have this right next to my garage door coming into the house and opted for the six shoe pair version. It assembles quickly by snapping all the arms into place & placing holding pads, took less than 10 minutes. It is a convenient design that has been durable after a few weeks of use. One benefit unbeknownst to me was that it shows why you need this product. After retrieving and placing shoes worn everyday, it is evident that all the nasty substances such as dirt, pet hair, & all the other gunk that sticks to your shoes falls on the holding pads. And because the holding pads are white, you can see right away why it is not a good idea to wear shoes into the house after they have been worn all day out in the streets. Shoes are totally unsanitary. I am able to clean this product easily by spraying with a water hose outside and drying it off. Our family is working towards going shoe-free in the house and seeing the benefits of its functionality, easy maintenance & assembly, space saving, and convenience, I am going to be purchasing a second one. I am planning on zip-tying them together to connect them. Excellent product, highly recommended, and going to buy another.",
