It is sturdy, and the wood top has a coating on it that feels like it would be very durable against dings and dents. It also is an interesting pattern. Most cheap shoe racks are wobbly - this one is not. This one withstood my cats running and jumping on it during assembly, just to give you an idea.It is very easy to assemble, and does not require tools. It comes with a small tool to help tighten screws when you\u2019re done. Took me about 15 minutes to complete. The instruction manual has clear labels and direction in many languages as well as a number of picture guides on how to put it together.It doesn\u2019t take up much space, and I am happy with my purchase. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is considering purchasing, and if I need other items from this manufacturer again, I will most definitely be returning.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a basic shoe rack to fit under the window by my front door. This worked perfectly. It easily holds 9 pairs of men's size 12 shoes on the 3 shelves and would hold 3 more on the top shelf although I left it empty. Will not fit my boots, even regular ankle-length hiking boots. That's OK I put them in the closet. So for men's sneakers or casual shoes, it holds 12 if you use the top shelf and would fit 16 women's smaller shoes, 4 on each shelf. Took about 30 minutes to build and is sturdy for what it is. Good buy thank you!!!",
