I didn't expect it to be as sturdy and as well made at such a reasonable price point.It was easy to assemble, and screws and Allen wrench were included. I didn't even have to find a screw driver. Additional screws are included should you want to expand with another rack on top.The powder coating is quality, as is the overall thickness and weight of the metal construction.The best part is that it fits a small space by my entrance door and holds my shoes and boots with room to spare.I like that it is metal and soles of damp shoes, and boots can dry out compared to wooden shoe racks that require more care.I posted some photos to give you a closer look and hope that they help you out a bit with your choice. Thank you!",
