I don\u2019t see this working for any adult sized shoes. It is also thin and delicate so not for heavy wear. It is however, perfect for what I needed. It\u2019s small enough for my little ones shoes and low enough she can reach and pick the pair she wants to wear each day.",

I suggest arranging the four end pieces the way they need to line up first, so you do not end up having to disconnect one corner to rearrange the end piece. It can take a little effort to squeeze the last corner together. But once assembled this unit works fine for what we need.",

For a good while, it housed one of the steps of my runners off my truck after it got torn off during an off road adventure.Muddy shoes, boots, bags, purses, dog accessories, sometimes even an actual dog.. who knows. This little rack doesn\u2019t look like it would withstand the torture it\u2019s been through but it doesn\u2019t even have a scratch. And I\u2019ve had it for a few months now before writing this review.Honestly, I wasn\u2019t planning on writing a review for this because I really didn\u2019t think it would last longer than a week in my house. Boy was I wrong!Oh, it was also really easy to assemble and fits a good amount of shoes (and other items).",

This was priced well and fitted my criteria. As I was assembling it, many of the plastic connectors cracked and fell apart. That was disappointing enough, but I got to the end of the assembly process and found there were 2 connectors missing so I couldn\u2019t add the \u201chandles\u201d at the top. I am left with a shoe rack that looks decent from a distance, but with all the cracked connectors holding it together I doubt it will last long.",
