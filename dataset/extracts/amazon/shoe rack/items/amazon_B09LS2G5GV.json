                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A beacon of hope in an ongoing sea of despair.",
                "reviewText": "So, first, I purchased one of those hollow-metal-tubed-framed, canvas-shelved pieces of trash and the canvas shelves began tearing away from the frame almost immediately. They tore away from their frames as if the manufacturer had intentionally perforated them specifically to do this. After 1.5 years of careful handling, periodic, impromptu mending emergencies, and a quiet, simmering resentment building upon each glance afforded it, the only reasonable course of action was to fly into a frothing rage-tornado during which it was retired, bit by jagged bit, into the trash. Shoes tumbled to the floor and scattered like refugees fleeing a Kaiju.And there they remained.I have a shoe problem which I don\u2019t feel is any of your business. But I have a lot of kicks and they needed a home. So, in the aftermath of the previous disaster, I bought a large, plastic utility shelf\u2014TWO large plastic utility shelves\u2014 which turned out to be stupid. I have no idea how an item as simple as a shelf-unit can exude so much awkwardness. And that was all there was to that phase. It was a stupid idea that ended up being a stupid act carried out with the casual bravado of someone with nothing to lose. Which is not the case with me. I definitely have things to lose. I don\u2019t have that much but I do have a shoe condition.With 30+ pairs of shoes languishing in a pile and serving as a perfect monument to my ineptitude and with nary a hint of imminent relief, I proceeded to embark on the quest of a lifetime (if we can agree that by \u201clifetime\u201d I mean 11 days).So, the ratio of bs, scam, ads for those really cool-looking shoe boxes that have the drawers that slide out and make the front panels pop up to access your shoes and they\u2019re really stackable and you can see your shoes in them because they\u2019re clear and, oh, yeah, some of them light up is 1,000,000,000,000:0.Then I found these. I kind of just looked at them for a few days. I mean, I\u2019d just been burned by two different and avoidable mistakes and I was feeling vulnerable but I did put them in my basket. I\u2019d come back to them fairly regularly and couldn\u2019t stop checking them out. They looked sleek, sturdy and able to accommodate a variety of different shoe styles. During this courting process, I\u2019d toy around with taking a chance on one of those shady ads for the magic boxes I previously mentioned but I was merely delaying the inevitable. Finally, I just took the plunge and ordered these shelves.There\u2019s been a lot of sh_tty things that have happened this year. This shelf set is not one of them. It is perfectly designed, with shelves that can be alternated between flat and angled. If you haven\u2019t been on a seemingly endless search for shoe-racks for the last 7 years, you may not be aware that a lot of shoe-rack-manufacturers sell angled shoe racks. And you would probably also not be aware that every single stupid one of those angled racks is designed to allow any shoes placed on them to just slide right off and onto the floor. They\u2019re like joke shoe racks you would buy for someone you passive-aggressively hate to induce a frustration heart attack. They\u2019re the \u201cdribble cups\u201d of shoe racks. Someone, sometime in the past came up with the reasonable idea of angling shoe racks so that shoes could be easily seen at a glance. Unfortunately, whoever that individual was also lacked both the mental acuity to understand the most basic principles of physics and/or the verbal skills to convey the need in their design for something to \u201cstop\u201d the shoes from falling. Like, a \u201cstopper\u201d or something.In stark contrast is this shoe rack that has been designed by a manufacturer with top developer talent who have the education and experience required to know that when you point an object at the floor and then place it on a smooth slope at a certain angle, it will definitely slide off onto the floor\u2014 unless there is some kind of \u201cstopper\u201d at the end to stop it from doing so and this company spared no expense in this area. When angled downward, the shoes gently rest against an upward angled lip. It\u2019s as if they felt the thuds of countless shoes hitting floors around the world and took it upon themselves to make this ongoing travesty right.With this design feature incorporated perfectly into its functionality, this shoe rack was already head and shoulders above anything else I\u2019ve ever encountered. Now, put a pin in that element and remember it when I tell you that, in addition to being designed by (probably) retired NASA scientists, it was also so easy to assemble that I was tempted to disassemble it immediately upon completion and scatter its components around to recreate an environment and blood pressure level more in line with my past experiences. Because, isn't there a law that specifically states that shoe-rack-construction must involve at least 278 bellowed expletives, hate-tears and PTSD? I checked and not only is there no law specifically requiring violence during shoe-rack assembly, there are no laws involving shoe racks at all. In the case of these shelves everything went together not only correctly but easily\u2014 as if the manufacturer\u2019s intention was to create something useful and intuitive rather than something that culminates in a welfare check from the police department. It even comes with a little \u201cS\u201d-shaped, allen-wrenchy tool (the only tool you need) which allows it to be deftly manipulated to quickly screw in the associated bolts\u2014 all of which are exactly the same! I didn\u2019t even know that this level of simplicity was possible.If you need a shoe rack, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this set. If my shoe condition doesn\u2019t improve, I may even need to pick up another set myself.100 Bazillion Stars.",
