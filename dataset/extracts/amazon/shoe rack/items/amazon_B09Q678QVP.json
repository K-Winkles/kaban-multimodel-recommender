                "reviewText": "I was torn when I ordered this, I have ordered some things on Amazon that are less then well made. I crossed my fingers and clicked place order.Put together just now and I am amazed! Went together easily, didn't need the included hammer, just my hands. It is super sturdy and will hold a ton of shoes! I also have a basket of dog things on it because I actually ran out of shoes and boots. It's nice to know I have extra room if I spy another pair I have to have!I could get 3 pairs on each shelf by flipping the heel and toe of each pair. It gave me room to stack smaller shoes in the center of each shelf.If you are on the fence just order it, you will be happy!!",

I was even able to use the majority of the racks for a shoe rack for the garage, for outdoor shoes for the family, and use the remainder in our closet for extra shoe storage. It is made of a sturdy plastic, but holds up for what we need it for. The directions were easy to understand and came with all the pieces necessary. It also has an extra peice with 5 hooks that attaches to the side that you can hang extra (light) items on for additional organization. Great shoe rack for the price.",

The rods are cheap light weighted metal. The bad part is the mallet used to put it together didn\u2019t stay together, the head kept falling off so I had to use wood glue to glue the head to the handle so it didn\u2019t fly off as I hammered it together.
