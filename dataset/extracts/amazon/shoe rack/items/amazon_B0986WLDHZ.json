                "reviewText": "This is a good sturdy shoe rack which fit perfectly for my needs. I wanted some low profile shoe storage able to fit baskets to hold clothes on the top rack.I measured my space to determine how many racks I needed, what height I needed with what size baskets in place to clear the hanging clothes above easily.I ordered 3 shoe racks, which had 2 shelves each. All arrived quickly, packed in flat boxes, in perfect condition, all parts included with easy to understand diagrams to follow, an Allen wrench provided which worked great. It took only about 10-15 mns to put each one together without help (another pair of hands to hold something.) It\u2019s a good stable unit, lightweight, holds everything well and looks great. I recommend its goodness.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the two level shoe rack to hold my boots inside my entry closet. It came in a very compact box, making me wonder how this was going to be 27\" wide, but the shelves are cleverly hinged. All pieces and assembly instructions were included. It took me no more than 15 minutes to get it unboxed and ready to go. Holes lined up, extra screw included, dowels included if you were stacking another unit on top, and it included pads to cover the bottom of the legs. It easily held 6 pair of boots for me. The distance between the top and bottom shelf is just under 6\", so shorter boots needed to go on the bottom shelf. Distance from floor to bottom shelf is about 4.5\", so I put my Crocs on the floor under the shelf. The unit made very sturdy by the attachment of the legs which had notches in them to fit against the shelf. Clever design and well constructed. One minor thing is only 6 pads were included for the legs instead of 8, but not a deal breaker. Five stars from me!! I would definitely recommend it.",

I love that you can keep stacking it if you bought a couple more layers. It\u2019s exactly what we needed and I love it. Great deal especially for the price. It would work well in a closet too if you needed it for that. I highly recommend this!",

I bought two to span the closet length, and they effectively organize and display numerous pairs of shoes. Assembly is straightforward, and the overall quality is reasonable. However, a potential drawback lies in the sturdiness, as the construction may only withstand moderate use over time. While satisfied with the current purchase, I am seeking a more durable, long-lasting option and may want to explore alternatives before considering a repeat buy.",

Fits about 5 pairs of small child shoes.Con: The shelves under are best for lower type of shoes.Trekking or slightly higher shoes might not fit very well.

And I love that the units are built from a material that\u2019s sustainable, light and NOT plastic. As I\u2019ve only had the units a few weeks I can\u2019t speak to long-term durability, but they certainly appear to be quite sturdy and should last a long time, assuming, of course, we don\u2019t try to put too much weight on them!
