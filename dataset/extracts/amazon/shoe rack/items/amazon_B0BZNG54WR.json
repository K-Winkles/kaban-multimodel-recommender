                "reviewText": "Before I go into detail, I want to note that I acknowledge that the bigger the shoe rack is, the less sturdy it tends to be. However, that in itself is not enough to justify the flaws of this product. So let's get to it! I pride myself in being someone who excels at assembling things for myself and for other people with just a simple instruction sheet. With that said, this is absolutely not an easy product to install. The instructions are clear enough but the photos could be a bit clearer. I know there's a fine line between saying too little and being concise and I think the photos veer on the side of saying too little. This installation is not a one-man job. And if one little thing is not done according to instructions, you will be left with either a rickety shoe rack that isn't totally sturdy, or you'll be left with a less-than version of what you purchased (i.e. less levels or less features). What was the installation mistake that I made? I was confused by whether or not the concave screw holes were supposed to be a certain way so I constantly reassembled the brackets until I realized some were concaving and some weren't. It turns out the screw holes concaving or not is irrelevant... except maybe for the other end of the brackets... I'm still not sure about that other end. Anyway, me constantly reassembling and disassembling one end of the brackets I think made one of the long tubes loose (or at least one end of it loose) so now the shoe rack is not super sturdy.",
