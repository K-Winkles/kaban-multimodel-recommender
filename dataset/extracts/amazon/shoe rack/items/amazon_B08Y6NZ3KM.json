The fabric shelves are a little unorthadox, but I'm certain that is how they keep the cost down. I have only had this shoe rack for about a week so I can't comment on its durability. It is, however, a very sturdy for its light weight. I honestly can't think of any constructive criticisms at this price point. Well done, VASAGLE.",

The instructions were easy to follow and it took me about half an hour to assemble going at a leisurely pace. The overall look goes well in my bedroom, my wife and I can stop leaving shoes lying everywhere, and it provided an extra tabletop for knickknacks and so on.",
