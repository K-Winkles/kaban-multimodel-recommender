I have one outdoors and it\u2019s holding up great to the elements after several months. My only complaint is the gold color looks a little off, it\u2019s more yellow toned than rich brass",

                "reviewText": "So for reference my shoe size is 8.5 or sometimes 9. That said, I can fit a lot of shoes on this rack. If you stack some of them like I did (one shoe facing forward and the other one facing back) you can even save some extra space. Also, this is pretty sturdy and it feels high quality. It\u2019s not plastic or flimsy so that\u2019s a win.Cons: I wish the gold was a little less yellow and a maybe a bit more subtle. This doesn\u2019t bother me that much. But if you have other gold tones in your closet and you are picky about how they match, maybe that\u2019s something to consider. Also, I am not a huge fan of the extra holes they have on the sides due to extra stacking options. I understand why they are there, but I am just not a fan. To be honest though, you will only notice them when you put the rack together. I don\u2019t even notice they are there on a day to day basis which is why I keeping this 5 stars.",
