It is great because although it is light weight the shelves have a solid cloth and nothing falls through to the lower shelf. Putting it together takes a little time and patience as everything is separate. One of the plastic corners split when I put it together. I contacted the company and they replaced it. Excellent response and customer service.",

We have a 1200 sq foot home and our back door entry way was lacking. We had some organizers that I had gotten as gifts way back when and they were not space effective and they were kinda tacky looking. I looked to replace them. This organizer was the perfect measurements.It holds all our shoes and boots which were only 24 pairs. Not sure how people put more on this thing? My husband's shoe size is a 12EE so his shoes are big. We had to make some adjustments for my boots. We did this by taking the fabric out of one shelf. You can see this by the picture I posted.This is easy to keep clean, easy to use, and just what we were looking for. I would consider purchasing another & recommend. A good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I put this together today so I won't comment on its longevity. It is holding all my shoes plus a few other lightweight items and I hope it will serve its purpose long enough to make the price worthwhile.The sheet showing parts and assembly is only pictures. I started assembling the whole first shelf then realized that assembling all the individual elements of each shelf would be much faster: Put the long rods in every shelf sleeve; put both plastic ends onto every mid sized rod; put the mid-sized rods on each end of every shelf. Make sure to PRESS or PUSH the plastic ends TOGETHER onto the rods at every stage to create a tight joint (try not to press on the bare ends of the rods because the metal is sharp). Take the first shelf and put it down on a sturdy surface (floor or protected table) then put the shortest rods in each corner hole (the long arm of the plastic joint goes down). Add the next shelf, fitting each short rod into the long bottom arm of the plastic joint and PRESS together; add short rods to the top holes and add the next shelf and PRESS together. As each shelf goes onto the shelves below, press together firmly and you should feel the rods seating down into the plastic joints. I only pressed down on the corners so that the rods would not bend and the plastic would not break. When fully assembled with the rods fully seated into each joint, the unit was sturdy enough to carry and place into the corner I needed it to fit into.The unit can be built as short units if they need to fit under something - just don't use some of the short rods.The unit I received did not have any issues with the heat seams on the shelf sleeves or any defects in the rods or plastic joints. The plastic joints puzzled me at first then I realized I had them oriented the wrong way. The joint has three arms of about equal length plus a hole at the \"corner\"; the shelf rods should have the holes all on \"top\" and the long arms all on the \"bottom\". The long arms also form the feet of the bottom shelf.I imagine if you did not press the rods and joints together that the pieces can come loose and the unit can collapse. I intend to press it together occasionally to keep it sturdy.",

I also live in downtown Chicago in a condo and my wife and I have limited room. So now that I have qualified myself I can tell you this is the best shoe rack I've ever had. How many of you have had the rickety pipe and plastic tree tower that falls and breaks apart when you breathe on it or take off some shoes?? As you can see by the picture I can't store my shoes like a normal person. I have too many so I have do basically double and triple up!! Because this is such a low price as well, I thought I would give it a try and see if it would work. Oh my goodness does it ever work!! It holds all my shoes and when I take a pair out it doesn't fall apart!! Men's shoes are heave, let's face it, I think you could probably hold twice as many women's shoes. I don't normally write reviews, but for people like me, who have a shoe buying problem, I had to share!!!",

I will be returning this product however because it seems flimsey and was not large enough. I planned on using this for all of my heels. This would be a great storage solution for sandals, flats, sneakers...but not for heels or booties. The dividers are smaller than the height of my phone so fitting heels in there is impossible. I was able to switch around some rods to make the opening bigger to fit boots in the bottom, but it makes the product more likely to fall, and the rest of the dividers still cant be used for my needs. Note that this product uses lightweight metal rods, plastic connectors, and a plastic/fabric material that looks cheap but is actually fairly sturdy of you were using lightweight shoes. I'm going to return it and get an over the door shoe rack instead as that seems to by my only storage option at this point.",
