                "reviewText": "Looks like I'm at that point in my life where I'm excited about shoe racks, but after the collapse of my previous piece of junk which miraculously held up for 8 years it was time for a new one. Did the usual perusing of Amazon and came across this one. I was hesitant to buy yet another potentially plastic piece of junk but decided to give it a go. So far so good after putting it up last night and as of now it's still standing. I took on the endeavor alone, and really think it would benefit as a two-person job, but I got it done. Just took a long while. As others have mentioned, there are a gazillion pieces. In all fairness, might not have taken quite as long as I wasn't following directions well. The directions are really good, and if you're paying attention (maybe not listening to an audiobook and actually focusing), probably will save you some time. As it was, it took me about 1.5 hours to do. Kudos and much respect to the person who said it took them 15 minutes.This thing is great and has plenty of room for all my shoes. The shoe rack is just mine and as such holds women's shoes, size 7.5. I've got almost 50 pairs of shoes on here with room leftover. As I was not following directions well I did not put this together as all the other reviewers I've seen done but it worked out perfectly for the space I'm using it in and how I wanted my shoes organized. I don't have a lot by way of tall boots and stuff and don't need the huge openings. I do really like that this thing is customizable, even if I did it by accident.I made much use of the included mallet, not so much with the gloves, and pressed in each piece and section the best I could, at times using my own body weight. I feel like it's as secure and sturdy as it can be but I'm considering anchoring it to the wall just in case. It's a very lightweight piece, and I was easily able to carry/maneuver it from the bedroom where it was put together to the walk-in closet. Like a lot of other reviewers I would like to have more of those sleeve things for the shelves but other than that, pretty well pleased with it. Very impressed with how all the pieces came so organized in their packaging and with the detailed instructions and how easy it was to put together. It felt like the manufacturer put thought into how to make the process of putting this piece together as easy as possible.",

So this thing is a lot steadier than I thought it would be, wider and taller as well. It seems like it\u2019s going to do a great job. It\u2019s supposed to be a shoe rack, but we are going to use it for herbs and as a display for some geodes. It was very simple to put together. The black solid pieces aren\u2019t actually solid, it\u2019s the same poles with spaces- it just had a piece of thick paper you slide on it. Those could be bigger, in order to cover the entire area. It is thicker paper and seems like it\u2019s going to last a bit, but it would be better off it were plastic or a stiff cloth piece, or maybe vinyl. I got a sale price, but this usually goes for $60\u2026 so that piece should be something more durable. The design is cute on the paper.Overall, this is a really nice piece\u2026 not super pretty, but very functional.",

I didn't know what to expect because this was reasonably priced and plastic. It was going to my basement and my shoes are 95% little, lightweight canvas sneakers. It IS easy to put together, but there are lots of pieces! Like Legos for adults and a lot less fun to assemble! The wooden mallet was super handy. It was a bit time consuming to complete, but not ridiculous, by any means. One (wo)man job. Happy to report, it is surprisingly sturdy! I 100% recommend this for light duty shoes. Maybe a few heavier boots and/or shoes on the very bottom. I'm very pleased!",
