            "\u3010THICKER MATERIAL\u3011This 6-tier shoe storage organizer is made of thicker metal tubes, which are not easily bent or broken. The exterior is sprayed with a rust resistant coating to make it waterproof and easy to clean, with a smooth surface that does not harm hands.",
            "\u3010EASY TO ASSEMBLE\u3011We provide you with illustrated instructions, without the need for tools, simply insert the tube into a high-quality plastic connector and the assembly can be completed in a few minutes. You can detach one layer and make it into a high compartment to place your tall boots, bags, or large storage boxes, meeting your storage needs.",
            "\u3010SPACE SAVING\u3011The size of the tall narrow shoe rack assembled is 35.4\"L*11\"W *43.3\"H, which can store up to 24-28 pairs of shoes. The stackable design saves space and allows you to bid farewell to shoes that are scattered all over the floor and nowhere to be placed. It arranges them neatly so that you can quickly choose the ideal shoes and keep the limited space in order.",
            "\u3010STRONG LOAD-BEARING\u3011Thickened tubes give the shoe rack super load-bearing capacity, extending its service life, and can easily hold heavy shoes or storage boxes. The structure is sophisticated and not easy to collapse. Tips: Due to thermal expansion and contraction, when the weather is cold, soak the connectors in warm water for a few minutes, and will be better for assembling.",
            "\u3010MULTIPURPOSE SHOE RACK\u3011This standing shoe rack shelf can be placed at the entryway, closet, living room, hallway, garage, changing room, apartment, or in areas where excess shoes are piled up. The shoe storage cabinet not only store shoes, but also toys, bags, and boxes, making your life more convenient and your home cleaner and tidier.",
            "Tips: If you find some pipes missing during the assembly process, please feel free to contact us to resend it for you."
