                "reviewText": "Came in a shoe-box size box which caused some initial concerns, but after installation, final completed unit is surprisingly stable, albeit a tiny wobbly, but more than adequate to store shoes. 33\" wide shelves can store 4 adult-size running shoes or 3 adult men's wide dress shoes. Cloth-like shelves are thin and easily torn if abused, but good enough to hold heavy shoes and waterproof to prevent dust/dirt from falling down to lower-level shoes. Shelf height is only 6.2\" high so taller shoes need to be placed on their sides. Many metal tubes and plastic connectors and installation was tedious, but straightforward; probably took an hour to set up an 8-tier unit. First couple shelves required a learning curve, but fairly fast afterwards. Add-on side hooks, cloth gloves (to avoid a few sharp edges) and wooden mallet were nice touches and helped during installation. Overall, very pleased: an excellent value and a functional product (\"does the job\") for the garage or closet, but maybe not a fancy showcase unit, depending on personal tastes.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Be aware of a couple things",
                "reviewText": "First, this thing is ok, but only ok. If I was intending to store it near an entryway or anywhere that people coming into my home would see it, I would have returned it. Stored in my closet, it's fine.For the price, I would say you get what you pay for. For $22 and change, it will do the job. Had I paid much more than that, though, I would feel ripped off.Assembly: This was unnecessarily difficult. First, the instructions are very vague. You must be careful to specifically point connectors, the \"shelves\" (more about those follows), and poles in the right direction, or you'll find yourself going back to take things apart and begin anew. I had to do that a couple of times with connectors (no big deal, since this was easy to catch) and one entire level (annoying). In the end, I really could and probably should have taken the entire thing apart after it was done and I discovered that the little side pocket attachment requires that the side connectors all face a certain direction. You'd think it wouldn't matter, but you'd be wrong. If the connectors that connect one vertical pole to the next aren't facing a certain way, the space between shelves can be off. You won't know this by looking at them and you probably won't notice until the whole thing is assembled. I just took one level apart and flipped the shelf instead of wasting another 30-45 minutes redoing the entire unit. The hem/seam of the shelf is facing up instead of down now, but, as I said, it's just in my closet. And it's only the bottom shelf.They include a little wooden mallet (anything sturdier would trash the hollow poles on impact), and a pair of white \"jazz hands\" gloves that make putting poles into connectors utterly impossible. They're supposed to protect your hands from cuts because of the sharp edges at the ends of the poles, but if you're careful, you don't need them, which is good since they completely defeat your ability to twist the poles into the connectors because they have zero traction.Quality: This thing is cheap, and it shows. The \"shelves\" are a type of plastic woven \"fabric.\" Think tarp, but very, very thin and fragile tarp. A tarp that could be cut quite easily and accidentally. The \"seams\" appear to be created by a heat stamp, which likely won't stand the test of time, nor would they support much weight. I have 5-6 pairs of shoes on each shelf, most of which are sneakers, so it should hold up for a while. Twenty-two bucks worth of time anyway.All of that said, it should last a couple years, as long as I don't move it around or fiddle with it. If we were moving to a different home, I'd just throw it away and get something sturdier because I doubt it would survive a journey in a moving truck, even if only across town. I'm not 100% sure it would survive a journey to a different closet in my own home, frankly.But, for $22 bucks, I can't complain much, although I do think I had to work WAY too hard to put a $22 flimsy rack together. If you assign a value to your time and add that into the price, you're looking at more like $70-$100, and that's far too much. Your time is worth something, too, so factoring that in, I would say I overpaid. By a lot. Just looking at the Amazon price, it's okay. But, as I said, just okay. I wouldn't buy it again; let's just put it that way.",

No problem getting it to sit evenly on the floor. Sturdier than I expected. I can fit a lot of pairs of shoes. I am using this inside my front closet.",
