Just ordered another one for my son's closet as well since he has too many pants for his dresser and can not fit another large stand in his room. Can hold so much more than just shoes. Wonderful price for such a space saver and organizer. Love the pockets feature. Have never seen this with any other shoe rack I've shopped for in the past.",

It\u2019s not the most study thing in the world, but it\u2019s just for shoes and not climbing so it\u2019s good enough for its purpose. Plenty of space for shoes and keeps our coat closet tidy.",

Assembly itself was easy but you need a bit of force to push the pieces all the way in. Additionally, one of the shoe mats that came with my order came ripped and seemed very flimsy. While it does the job of holding my shoes, I wouldn\u2019t order this again.",

What I like most about it is the vinyl shelving that the shoe sit on, when it gets dirty, you can just wipe it right off. And it's honestly the perfect size to fit right in an entryway.",
