However, I do have at least 25 to 30 pairs of shoes on this shoe rack at the moment. It is very durable and easy to set up. I like that it has the cover so you could zip it if you needed to to keep it from having dust, or what have you. Overall this was worth every penny and has made my shoe storage much more streamlined. I like that it has space for tall boots as well as daily wear regular shoes.This is also light weight and easy to put wherever you want it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this shoe rack in hopes to organize my closet and free up space. The Amazon picture made it seem the frame was hard/ sturdy with only the flap cover loose. There is no hard frame just the skeleton, it's a cloth material and it is loose made of the grocery store cloth bags mesh material. While no tools are needed to assemble it, it came with a small wooden mallot to help tighten the grip of the pvc pieces. One small smack and the mallot broke. This is more in the $15.00 range and not $30.00. I'm giving it 1 start for the ease of assembly. That saved this item's rating.",
