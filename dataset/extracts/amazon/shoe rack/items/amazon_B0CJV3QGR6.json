The unit is relatively strong, but not nearly as strong as a, say, wooden shelf of the same dimensions would be. If you are counting on this to be kept out away from any side to side support--by the front door, say--I would caution you to make sure one side is up against a wall. I think this will last a long time where I have it now--wedged between my dresser and a tote bin in my clothes closet. It adds valuable shelves for shoes, but I don't have to worry about it swaying from side to side and possibly bending and breaking because it has support on either side.",

All the parts were there along with instructions and a wooden hammer. While I currently have it set up as a single unit with a shelf at every layer, I appreciate that if I decide to I can split it into different units and/or remove shelves to create areas for taller shoes. With two pairs of shoes per layer, there should be plenty of room for my son and me to have all our shoes in this.",

                "reviewText": "My kids needed a better place for all their shoes. They are 5 and 8 and have a ton from grandparents and the shoe bin method wasn't working. They wear a few pairs religiously and they weren't putting them back in the bins and then they'd be left all over the house with the kids asking me what shoes to wear. They'd finally check the bin and, inevitably, shoes they forgot about no longer fit.I did modify this set, though. It make a nice, tall, 10 layer rack. My kids are tall, but not that tall. I removed 2 layers and put them in the living room for me. Each kid gets 4 rows to fit shoes and they were able to downsize from there. The shelves are a little narrow, so boots aren't going to fit, except on the top rack. You could modify the set though and use the mid length bars to make a few taller shelves.Overall a very versatile piece that fit perfectly in our office and the kids love it. For kids or someone that is neurdivergent and needs to see their shoes to know which ones they have, this set it great. It's not closed away, but everything looks neat and tidy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When I first opened this box I was little worried when I saw all the bars and plastic pieces. Im use to building furniture, so I went straight to the instruction! After I got the first few pieces connected and attached I realized it wouldn\u2019t be as hard as I originally excepted! It does take some time and patience, but it\u2019s a relatively simply process.The metal bars and plastic pieces are made with lightweight material. It is solid and stable when set in one spot but can be knocked over easily when empty or given a little force. The upside to that is that it\u2019s easy to move from one place to another.Inside the box:* Metal bars, Plastic connecting pieces and Fabric shelvesPros* Simple instructions* Easy to relocate from one place to another* Plenty shelf space for shoes* Easy to create space for larger items if necessaryCons* Lightweight material makes shelf easy to shakeIf you were looking for an easy to use shoe organizer for your house, apartment, or small living set up this could be a great option for you! Assembly takes some time but it\u2019s not overly complicated. 20 to 30 minutes tops if you\u2019re doing it while watching TV like I did lol. This shoe rack is compact enough that it won\u2019t take up a ton of extra space. So if you\u2019re a person who is looking for organization and efficiency, this will be a great fit for you!",
