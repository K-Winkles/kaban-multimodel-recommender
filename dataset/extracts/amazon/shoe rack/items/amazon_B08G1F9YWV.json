                "reviewText": "Assembly was easy but I had to redo a couple of times because the plastic joints have to be done a certain way and it can be confusing sometimes. Was surprised to find out the material was fabric at the base holding the shoes. I guess I didn\u2019t pay attention. I assumed it was metal or plastic as the fabric does look like metal in pictures. But I guess for the price, it works. Lastly more importantly, I figured out a new configuration that would allow me to use all 10 bases for shoes without giving up one base to house tall boots. The instructions tells you to skip a base to allow for more room for tall boots. Well, what I did was I used the longer metal rod for one of the bases instead of the shorter one that we are supposed to use. That allowed me to get more space for tall boots and still use all 10 bases. It\u2019s kinda hard to explain but my picture shows the configuration I used. I used the longer rod at the bottom hence my boots fit there. I ended up with a ton of extra parts since I did not follow instructions but it worked out for me. You can see all the extra parts in the second picture.All this headache could have been avoided if the manufacturer included 2 more joints. Then I wouldn\u2019t have had to improvise and do my configuration. But it all worked out. I feel like a genius for solving this puzzle. Oh and the metal rods can bend easily in the middle. I tried in assembling a rod and forced it a bit too hard from the joint and it bent. So go easy on these things.",

                "reviewText": "I did not believe how many shoes I had until I started to fill up Apicizon 10 Tiers Shoe Rack. I have over 50 pairs of shoes, slippers, sandals, and boots. I even threw worn-out shoes I had for years. At least I can find my shoes easily instead of looking through all the boxes to find what I wanted to wear that day. It makes my getting dressed so much easier to get the right shoe to wear that day. It took me a while to put it all together but it was worth the time. The shoe racks I have had before could only keep a few pairs on them and they never looked organized. Apicizon Shoe Rack was well wort the time to put it together and now I can find my shoe in seconds.",
