And, if you mess up, it's wasy to correct your mistake.The idea of being able to wheel this unit from place ro place is nice but in actually the wheels are so tiny you're more or less scraping the floor. So much traction that I opted to just pick up the unit. It's not heavy.This plastic set is a rather, well-made contraption. There's an elegance to it. The tinted magnetic window are a nice touch. Fits well in my custom closet. I'm overall very pleased to have a space for my shoes.Will recommend for sure!",

You just pull it straight (like and accordian), push the panels back so that they lock into place, and remove the stickers from the little \"doors\" that cover each box. Since I have small feet, I was able to fit 3 pairs of shoes into the boxes if I wanted to. I just stacked the shoes on top of each other, side-by-side. Worked out great, my space looks much more tidy, I can see the shoes through the panels, and (best of all) they are protected from dust. The person who designed this product is a genious. I was reluctant to spend the extra money, but I'm glad that I did.",

                "reviewText": "It took me a minute to get the hang of how the panels connect, but once I figured it out it was relatively easy to snap everything together. Definitely easier than furniture that doesn't come pre-assembled. It felt flimsy at first, but once put together it is surprisingly sturdy despite not being super heavy.I felt like the price was a bit high, but anything of comparable size either looked like terrible quality, not aesthetically pleasing, and/or did not look like a good design for keeping shoes dust-free while still being easy to access. All-in-all and after shopping around a lot, I feel this is a good deal for what you get.I've been using it for a few days and all the parts seem to be staying in place. I'm using it for sandals, high tops, and ankle boots. The bottom two cubbies will hold taller boots, and my ankle boots fit in the shorter cubbies.If it falls apart or I have any issues with it later I will update my review.",
