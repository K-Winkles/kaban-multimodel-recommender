During assembly you need to be careful not to break anything, the rack becomes more sturdy once fully assembled but the individual pieces are quite fragile.It looks super tidy (especially with the cover) and works perfectly well as a shoe rack. I've even put hiking boots on it and they fit well. It takes about three pairs of (something) per shelf.I'd buy it again, especially at this price!",
