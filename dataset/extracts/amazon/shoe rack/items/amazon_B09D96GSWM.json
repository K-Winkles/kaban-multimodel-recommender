                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this to hold my shoes (obviously) and was happy to see that it could hold all of them! It was easy to assemble no extra parts needed and you just connect the metal poles to each other with the plastic connectors. What surprised me though is the thing that holds the shoes is like a paper fabric (?) and flimsy but once you assemble it it\u2019ll turn tight and sturdy to hold shoes like nothing! Extremely light weight too! It was easy to pick up and move around even with shoes on it and it\u2019s convenient since it\u2019s small but holds so much. Putting it together was a little tricky only because it wasn\u2019t sitting straight like an uneven wobbly table but it somehow turned out to be okay and become level with the ground again. For the price and quality combined I do recommend this since I just wanted something quick and cheap to buy, I sure got my money\u2019s worth!!!",

                "reviewText": "This Shoe Cubby offers a cost-effective storage solution for shoe enthusiasts, and its relatively easy assembly process is a definite plus. However, it falls short in some aspects. Some of the plastic connectors were undersized and exhibited flashing, which hindered the overall stability of the cubby. Achieving a level configuration can be time-consuming, and the poorly written instructions make the setup process more challenging than necessary. Despite these drawbacks, if you're willing to invest a bit of extra effort, the Shoe Cubby can still serve as a functional and budget-friendly shoe storage option",

                "reviewText": "I needed something of a specific size to fit into my closet.It came with all the pieces. I would suggest on the bottom to add some protection for the floors as it is bare metal. For DIY folks just a chair protector will work fine for the purpose..It took a lot of wrestling to get it together. I am a 50's woman and fairly small so maybe someone larger/stronger wouldn't have an issue.The directions were only about 1/2 step above an Ikea type direction. Got it together and it works fine. Not a lot of room between shelves so I would not suggest for any high heel except on the top.Did fit a Men's 12 shoe fine for depth.One of the legs was \"smushed\" at the connection point so I just used that for the top.Again - find for the $ and expect to get a lot of use.",

There are lots of parts and it'll take you at least 30 minutes but it's exactly what I was looking for. We needed something light weight and compact enough to store my husband's golf shoe collection in the storage bay of our rv. Fits great with everything else in there (totes, boxes, etc.).",
