I have had these in the past and found that if sunlight hits the fabric, they fall apart pretty quickly. There is one metal shelf for the bottom, which is weird that they'd mix them together. The shelves are not very tall. So, they're great if you want to get more shoes into a smaller height, but kind of a pain because they are just as tall as shoes, so you have to slide them straight in (squat down). So, these are not going to accommodate bigger shoes. So, those stripper pumps and size 13 trainers gonna have to find a different home.",

As long as you don't abuse it this should last many years. At $17 it seems a very good bargain value.",
