                "reviewText": "I purchased this to go over a boot tray, but unfortunately the legs are just a quarter inch outside the lip of the tray. Still, it has helped corral the shoes that pile up. I will say, as a boot wearer, that you can only put ankle boots on the top shelf (which will fit 3 pairs). Sneakers/shoes will go on the bottom two shelves. This is not helpful for the winter season, but will work well during the rest of the year. Easy to put together and solid once assembled. We'll see how it holds up once it gets wet with snow/slush residue. Would recommend if you need an unobtrusive, sturdy rack for storing shoes.",
