Assembling it is easier than making a peanut butter sandwich.Is it stylish? it's a statement \u2013 a statement that says, \"I value budget over boujee.\" High quality? Let's just say it makes IKEA furniture look like its actually manufactured in Sweden.Perfect for the college kid who's planning to throw it in the dumpster after a year or two. It's practically the Meryl Streep of basic furniture \u2013 does the job without demanding an Oscar. Plus, think of it as a short-term relationship; landfills need love too, right? Planet Earth secretly loves being buried under layers of not-so-chic but totally functional treasures. Who wouldn't want that kind of attention?",

In the picture I added, you'll see a small pair of womens hiking boots on this shoe rack and how tiny the rack is in comparison. I also didn't add 2 of the layers because it made each shelf so tiny that my shoes wouldn't fit. Super disappointed not not even worth the hassle of the return.",
