                "reviewText": "I purchased this to give our family of 6 more space to hang jackets and place shoes. The setup was relatively easy, but the pieces are easily breakable. Some pieces were harder to push on, which caused two pieces to break. Thankfully, they were not load barring, so we were able to make it work. It is cheaply made, in my opinion, so I don\u2019t expect years of use from it, but it works well for us currently. We will definitely be looking for a more sturdy one in the future.",

Don't buy unless you want to buy something to help keep it straight.",
