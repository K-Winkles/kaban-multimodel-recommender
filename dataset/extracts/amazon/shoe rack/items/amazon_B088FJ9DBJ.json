The height is adjustable if you forgo a few levels of the rack, as the height of the rack comes in sections which you can opt in or opt out of using when constructing. It is easy to disassemble to store or move. I am very satisfied with this rack and wish I purchased it sooner. I am happy to replace my previous mesh hanger that was attached to the wire rack with this metal rack to hold all of my every-day shoes and tote bags. One of the best utility purchases I have made on this site, by far. Although I was not very keen on the bronze colour, I can definitely say this rack will come with me as I upgrade my lifestyle in the future. 10/10 product and will be recommending it to my friends and family as they need.",
