                "reviewText": "Upon opening the box and revealing the contents of the stackable shoe organizers I thought of two things. (1) There seem to be a lot of pieces and (2) the material seems not sturdy.The main box frame is composed of material similar to those document or coupon organizer folders. Plastic, but thicker. They are flat and you have to bend them at the already pre-creased areas to form the box shape. There are other plastic parts to create the entire box. There is the vented back side panel and the front panel with the magnetic closure door. After forming the box, you have to fold in some tabs and line up the box with the back vent panel. Once you get it lined up, you push down and you will hear two distinct clicks. Now you flip it over, fold in the tabs and line up the door panel and do the same. It is important to note that these are stackable with a locking mechanism. When you are putting these panels on, make sure that you have all the same sides of the locking mechanism parts. There are nodules and there are the inserts that the nodules fit in and slide over to lock. There is also these capital \"i\" shaped plastic pieces that easily slide into the tops of two boxes being set side-by-side. This helps them stay together and increases their sturdiness. After spending a few minutes on the first box getting to know the layout and the line up the rest of the boxes took me about a minute or less each to set up.I have six of them inside my bedroom closet and I keep six of them by my front door. It is easy to put our shoes away when entering the house. I also use them to store some workout items and some of our dogs' walking accessories. I have two yoga mats and a yoga block on top of the boxes by my door. These items do not seem to impede the sturdiness of the boxes but I would not suggest putting more than a couple of pounds on top.So far, they are doing what I need them to do. It looks much nicer having our shoes in these boxes rather than just tossed on the floor. All in all, the setup was easy, and once connected and locked in, they seem a lot more sturdy than I had anticipated.",

                "reviewText": "I use these for a variety of things. I Have 3 sets. I use 27 of them for shows -- 3 rows of 9. The others I have used in the bathroom --I use two on the kitchen next to each other one to hold coffee supplies --filters -coffee grinder etc and the other to hold tea supplies. These are very convenient and eliminate clutter. For the 4 groups of 9 I use the plastic coupler to ensure that the boxes stay together. A real space saver and great for organization.",

Not the way I want but that's on me.I struggled putting it together, no instructions, but a comment here gave a discription of how to build. That was super helpful cause this girl couldn't get Part A into Part B. Once I got the first box made it was easy.Remember when I said there were no instructions? They were there and I didn't realize til after. Once again, me error. It is a real nice and sturdy box when you make it. I thought it would be a bit stiffer, but the product was flexible. I do enjoy the product, putting them together is pretty easy once you don't lose the instructions, and if you do there is that one comment that can walk you through it.",
