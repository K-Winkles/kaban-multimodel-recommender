For the longest time I would just throw my shoes in the closet but over time it became a HUGE pile of shoes... it was awful and an eye sore, and in all honesty made it more difficult to put my shoes on. I found these to be the cheapest listings of shoe racks I could find, so I decided to just go for it. My girlfriend assembled these in under 10 minutes and our closet is so much neater. JUST DO IT if you have a huge pile of shoes! They aren't insanely sturdy but they hold my boots (we wear a lot of boots) - they do their job. I would order again if needed :)",

It\u2019s not THAT deep because, I mean, it\u2019s a shoe rack, but I have been in a 5 month battle with this thing. I will say, it looks really nice when it is staying together but that is approximately 44% of the time. The middle connectors I feel have a personal vendetta against me since they do not actually keep the both sides together. I have like 3 pairs of shoes on it but GOD FORBID the pressure was too much for this little guy. Anywho, don\u2019t really recommend \ud83d\udc4d",
