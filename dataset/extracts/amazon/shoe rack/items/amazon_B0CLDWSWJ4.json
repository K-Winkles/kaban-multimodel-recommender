The word is plenty sturdy to hold shoes, the paint job is well done, the hardware is strong and stable.Assembly took only a handful of minutes. Just needed a Phillips screwdriver. All the parts were there, plus some extras (which I always appreciate even when I don\u2019t need them.) The holes were nicely drilled and everything went together easily.I installed the boards upside down from what they show in their picture so the cam bolts are on the bottom and won\u2019t show. They provided white covering dots which I went ahead and used anyway.The shoes in the picture are a men\u2019s 11 and a women\u2019s 6 for sizing.This should last a good long time as long as no one steps on it. Any guesses why we needed a new one in the first place?",
