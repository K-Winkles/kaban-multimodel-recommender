The only complaint is that there are three shelf fabric sheets were damaged on the top next to the box opening area. They look like cut damage. There is no protective material on the shelf sheets, so may be damaged when opening it. I want to send a message to the seller if they can send me a replacement for damaged shelf fabric sheets, but the site only allows me to return the items for a full refund which I don't intend to. I hope that the seller can send me three new shelf fabric sheets for the damaged part.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve been wanting to organize my shoes for a while. It\u2019s such an upgrade from my old shoe rack. I decided to split this in half (5/5), so it\u2019s not too tall.I\u2019ve assembled too many IKEA furnitures and furnitures in general, and I\u2019d have to say I hate to assemble this. No, it\u2019s not hard to do, and the instruction is more than clear. It hurt my hands so much doing this because it\u2019s so tight and hard to push each one into the frame! It slipped once and now my hands are scratched!But it looks great! I loved it. For $16, it\u2019s good, functioning, and making my shoes look more organized! With all the shoes on, it looks very beautiful. I can even put some shoe inserts for heels and sandals, and it holds up very well. It is also very sturdy and durable.This rack is very lightweight. Easy to disassemble if you need to store or move. It\u2019s very easy to carry around for sure! I didn\u2019t miss any parts. In fact, I\u2019ve some parts left once I was done.Nobody can really guess how much this rack is, without me telling them. They thought it\u2019s more expensive.",

I wear a size 5.5-6 and I was able to fit four pairs of tennis shoes on one Shelf and four-six pairs of heals on the other..... & flip flops a bunch lol....was also able to stack my boot boxes as well! Assembling wasn't too bad at all. It looks really intimidating when you first open the box cuz there's so many pieces. But it's not bad. My husband did help me though",
