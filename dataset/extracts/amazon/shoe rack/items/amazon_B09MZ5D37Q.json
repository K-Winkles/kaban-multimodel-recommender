                "reviewText": "My wife and I replaced our old shoe rack with this one. We could only store maybe 12 shoes tops with our old one but this one exceeds that by a lot! The build quality is fine, and the time to build is relatively quick, instructions were straight forward. I like the fact they come with little hangers too so we hang our keys there. Overall a very good purchase and happy with it so far! Let's us not have all our shoes spread out at our entryway!",

It takes patience and a LONG time to put together, and you\u2019ll definitely use the wrong pieces at times and have to go back. However, it\u2019s a good storage solution and sturdy. I wish the \u201cshelves\u201d were more of a fabric than plastic, but they get the job done.",

If you have limited strength it would be useful. It took me about 20 minutes to snap all of the rods in place. It definitely has cleaned up the appearance of our garage entrance without my kids shoes tossed everywhere. Definitely priced well for the quality. To test it out my husband's steel tip cowboy/work boots (very heavy)were placed on top along with my kids books bag on the side hooks along with other shoes and bags and it remained sturdy. It holds a variety of different item and different could work for things other than shoes. For small areas this would fit well and you can change the shelf set up for tall or wide.",

EDIT 5/4/22: I was able to get it built even with the one rod being bent at the top, but it is wobbly and the shelves are not balanced.ORIGINAL:This product is not easy to put together. It seems very simple, just plug the rods into the holes, but they\u2019re not. The piece with the plastic over them to make a shelf, make it very slippery to hold, even if you put them on last, it\u2019s hard to get the rods to line up. It\u2019s almost a two person job.The rods seem to fit better into certain holes, like they\u2019re not all the same size and it\u2019s like finding the right puzzle piece.As of right now, one of the rods is bent to where it doesn\u2019t fit at all into any of the holes. I haven\u2019t checked all of them yet. I\u2019ll see if my husband can fix it.I do like that this product is lightweight, and slim. It\u2019s cheap, and will get the job done but I\u2019m not sure I would recommend this to anyone else.",
