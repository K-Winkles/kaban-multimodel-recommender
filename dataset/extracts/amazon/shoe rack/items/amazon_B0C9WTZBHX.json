                "reviewText": "This product was extremely cheaply made. Several of the fabric shelves ripped in the process of building the thing. There were at least two missing pieces (I think maybe three but none were labeled so it was hard to tell.). The metal bars move around and cause the whole thing to lean even after using the provided mallet. The shelves themselves are too narrow to comfortably two pairs of shoes as shown. The shoes sit on top of each other. Would highly discourage this product. I never write reviews. I will be asking for a refund.",
