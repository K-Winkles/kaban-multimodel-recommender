I use to have one of those clipped racks and it was held together with duct tape and kept collapsing. My shoes were just a pile in my closet basically. This is still a relatively cheap rack, but it\u2019s great for what I need it for, sturdy, and holds many shoes! My husband assembled it in less than 5 minutes. Highly recommend if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money.",

                "reviewText": "This shoe rack is very easy to assemble. There are no tools needed, and none included! The metal rods ( I chose the bronze ) just snap together with a push pin holding the the assemble up. This makes it very easy to put together and can be done in less than ten minutes after you read the instructions. However, the fact that the rods are simply pushed together makes the shoe rack overall a bit unsteady. The real issue is today most of the casual shoes and even many of the more dressier shoes do not have a traditional heel, which would hold the shoe on the rack a bit tighter. Most of my shoes have a solid rubberized sole with no heel. All in all, this is a very useful and very easy to assemble shoe rack and is recommended.",

Smaller-sized kid's shoes would fall through the rails so this rack wouldn't work for them. It is a bit unstable and shaky so I had to push it against a wall to help keep it steady. It should have some kind of clamp to keep the adjustable rails in position. If you knock into it without enough shoes on it to hold it extended, the rails will slide back and forth easily. A clamp would probably make it more steady as well. Good enough for the closet floor where it won't be jostled very often.",
