I had to hammer the ends of the metal rods in to fit into the holes on at least half of them. The actual shelf piece is a felt piece covered in a plastic material. It seems sturdy enough but might rip over time with a sharp heel. I have some heavier boots that just barely fit in the shelf and if the shelf isn\u2019t supported, pulling the boot out pulls the shelf over. It is a pretty light shelf. I do imagine with too much weight on the shelf it will eventually break the plastic end pieces, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not that expensive.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a solution to many shoes in a very, very tight space, and this was the (almost) perfect answer! Very inexpensive, you can buy different versions of this (the various levels of tiers) and they all fit together, and very easy to assemble (I HATE assembly). Sturdy after a week and I have no reason to think it will change, although I'm not sure about much heavier shoes, like my husband's Timberland's-they may eventually make it start to bow in over time, maybe. My only real problem is I can't fit my husband's shoes (10.5W) and my shoes (7.5M) on the same level, it's not wide enough. I can work with it though between our shoes and our son's shoes. I bought 2 4-tier racks but used one as a 3 tier and the other as a 5 tier. Space saver and looks nice, too, very happy with the purchase overall.",
