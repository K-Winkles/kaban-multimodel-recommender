It is sturdy enough to hold 28 pairs of shoes (with wooden shoe trees inside). For boots, you have to store them sideways so that it will reduce the storage capacity.",

Sturdy and way more attractive than shoe boxes piled on top of each other. Or shoes lined up against the wall. Also keeps them dust free. For the price point, I hope nobody is complaining about a single thing. It\u2019s perfect for what it costs.",

                "reviewText": "This rack serves its purpose of organizing lightweight shoes, there are a few drawbacks that I'd like to highlight in this review.First and foremost, the shoe holder does a decent job of holding and organizing shoes. The design allows you to neatly display up to 28 pairs, helping to save space and keep your footwear collection organized. It is especially suitable for lightweight shoes such as sandals, flats, and sneakers.However, one aspect that left me slightly disappointed was the overall durability of the shoe holder. While it held up well for the lighter shoes mentioned earlier, it struggled with heavier or bulkier footwear. The construction is not as sturdy as I would have liked, and I noticed some bending and warping when trying to accommodate larger shoes or boots.Another minor concern I had was with regards to cleanliness. The material used for the shoe holder tends to accumulate dust and dirt relatively quickly. While this can be easily managed with regular cleaning, I would have preferred a more dirt-resistant or easy-to-clean material.It's important to note that the price of the shoe holder reflects its quality. While it may not be as durable or as easy to clean as higher-end options, it does offer a cost-effective solution for organizing and storing lightweight shoes. If you're willing to make some compromises in terms of durability and cleanliness, it can still serve its purpose well.",

I have over 30 pairs of shoes and I have more on the way. I've tried the plastic shoe box organizers and they constantly came apart at the doors. This shoe organizer to me is the best I own I would have paid 100$ for this!! And I still have room for a few more pairs of shoes!!! I love it!!!",
