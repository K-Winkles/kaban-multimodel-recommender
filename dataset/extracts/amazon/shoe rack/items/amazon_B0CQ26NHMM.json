If you\u2019re looking for something that requires limited assembly, this is not for you (it has 44 discrete pieces). If you\u2019re looking for something sturdy that will last for years, this likely is not for you. Though it has a lot of pieces and thus breaks down into a small package, it looks and feels as if a strong wind would carry it away, even when fully assembled. The shelves are constructed from two long pieces attached with a short plastic piece in the middle that isn\u2019t very sturdy and I suspect is going to fail pretty quickly. It may work for a short period of time, but in any household where it might accidentally get a backpack put on it or something similar, I doubt it will stand the test of time.",

                "reviewText": "The shoes scattered along our back porch step were becoming an eyesore, so I went looking for an inexpensive shoe rack that would help tidy things up a bit. This basic shoe rack does the job, though there are a few things you might want to consider. The biggest one is that, while the tubes that make up the frame of the shoe rack are metal, the shelves on top of which your shoes sit is made of very thin fabric, like the envelope-style packaging that leather purses might come in to keep them from getting scratched. You can see in my photo that the fabric appears wrinkled and one of them is even a little discolored where it had been folded. I hope that this will last in the outdoor space I have it in. We shall see! Second, don\u2019t be too hasty when assembling this rack. I figured it was self-explanatory and started putting the thing together, only to later realize that the longer tubes come in two different sizes (A and B). If you don\u2019t look closely, you\u2019ll mistaken them for the same length until you run into problems and have to refer back to the instructions to see what\u2019s going on. Lastly, the shoe rack is very lightweight, which is nice in terms of being able to move it around, but it\u2019s so lightweight that my phone strap got caught on it when I bent over, and I almost toppled the whole thing over. Still, it makes a good basic shoe rack that will hold about 9 pairs of shoes off the floor nicely.",

My only complaints is that it doesn\u2019t fit men shoes that great (my husband wears an 11.5) and it is on the cheaper side, hence the price. For me it works great for the basement or garage.",

I can still use this for smaller, lighter-weight shoes and sandals so it does have some value for me.The materials the shelves and rods are made of are only so-so in quality.
