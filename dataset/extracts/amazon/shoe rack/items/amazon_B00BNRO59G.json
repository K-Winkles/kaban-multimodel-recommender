Very sturdy and so simple to assemble. They even give you an extra screw AND the Allen wrench to assemble it with. This rack is stackable, which means it comes with four dowels to go into corner holes to hold the rack above in place. I have no need for another rack, so I used the dowels as feet at the bottom. They help hold the rack up from the carpet just a skosh that I think looks better than the corners sitting directly on the floor--YMMV. Anyway, just a fine, well-made product.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased (3) of these with the intention of stacking them. They are going to work out well, but there are a few issues I'd like you to know.PROS: The bamboo is nice looking and well put together. Overall, assemble is quick and easy and self-explanatory. Three adult pairs of shoes fit easily on each shelf, but boots have to be folded over or laid on their sides.CONS: The biggest issue is that the included dowel pins do not fit the pre-drilled holes. I attempted to \"drill out\" the pre-existing holes, but I was concerned it would affect the integrity of the wood. After putting two of them together I decided to go purchase the proper size dowel pins. After getting home and opening the third box I realized there were not any screws included. There were two packages of the wrong size dowel pins instead. I did not want to go back to the hardware store again, so I search around in my own parts bins and found a mixed matched set (8) of screws that would fit.All in all I am happy with what I ended up with, but BE PREPARED TO DO SOME TWEEKING OR MAKING ADDITIONAL PARTS PURCHASES TO ACTUALLY GET IT ASSEMBLED.",

                "reviewText": "You reviewer people almost scared me off this delightful little 20-buck rack, so tortuous were your descriptions of putting the darn thing together. Split wood! Screws that don't fit! No hardware! Perhaps the manufacturers heard you all and adjusted their tools. Perhaps a couple of those units were just one-offs, slapped together in the wrong factory on an off day. Perhaps some of you were drunk. But all I can say is that the box that arrived at my house yesterday contained four sturdy pieces of bamboo, plus a sweet little packet of brass screws that fit neatly into the pre-drilled holes on both shelves and sides. Also in the bag: A darling little hex wrench with which to drill those screws in. I put it together in five minutes, no lie. It fits our entry way like an interior designer came over and put it there.So, maybe if you're super reckless with the screwing part you might split some wood. I could see that happening, sure. But you'd really have to be going for it. Like deliberately not matching the holes up, or not paying attention to whether the screws are going in at an angle. Or you'd have to be drunk. But I suspect if that were the case you'd be a wreck trying to assemble Ikea or Home Reserve or Pottery Barn or any of the other seemingly hundreds of furniture items I've put together since we upsized a month ago from apartment to house. Because I don't think any furniture item could be easier to assemble than this one. I even drank a beer while I did it, and it went just fine. Then I went and order another one for my closet.",
