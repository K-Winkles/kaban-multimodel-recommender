I can\u2019t imagine how five stars were given for this product. Especially for the price!",

The assembly took about 35 minutes with another person to help, there's a lot of parts but you will get the hang of it. My shoes were out of control and it was hard to find them when they are in shoe boxes, it's like you don't see it you forget what's in there. This 5 tier rack helped me tame my shoes as I have work shoes, casual shoes, hiking shoes and walking sneakers etc. So I use this rack for shoes only (No boots), and I don't have young children or pets, so I can manage. It got my shoes organized and I'm happy about it.",

Both times it was very lackluster and the main issue is the flimsiness of it. It's very lightweight. To the points where an 18mo can knock it over. There's no way to anchor it to the wall either unless you get a kit from a third source. It's narrow which is a good bonus and it's one of the main reasons I wanted it, but the quality just wasn't there.",
