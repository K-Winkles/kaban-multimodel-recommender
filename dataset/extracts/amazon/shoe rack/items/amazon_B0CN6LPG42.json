                "reviewText": "So, I got myself this Shoe Rack, and let me tell you, it has changed the way my closet works! This shoe rack is not your average item \u2013 it's tall, sturdy, and built to last!The quality is amazing. This thing is rock-solid, tough and reliable. Unlike my other shoe racks from Amazon, this thing does not move around and seems like it'll last for years.I am no handyman, but the instructions were crystal clear, and all the nuts and bolts were in the box.This shoe rack ain't just for your short ankle shoes, it's a boot and shoe sanctuary. My wife's tall boots and fancy heels found a comfy spot.This Shoe Rack is indeed a must have. Sturdy, easy to set up, and it makes my closet look organized.",

                "reviewText": "This shelving system is solid & reasonably priced. Much better quality than similar products. The instructions could have been a bit clearer, tho. Just an extra sentence or 2 to demo how everything snaps together. However, I found it fairly easy to assemble after I re-read instructions a few times. One tip: They provide a little wooden mallet so you can lock each piece in place, as you go along. I hesitated to use it, lest I make a mistake & couldn't easily reassemble something. But that wasn't a prob, and the mallet is helpful for creating a solid unit. Glad I bought this shelping kit!",

Much more affordable than wooden, wire, or custom shelves.Customer service: 5 stars, my 1st shipment came with a couple damaged shelf bases and a free 2nd shipment was sent the same day after emailing.Sturdiness: Definitely will hold shoes as is. If you have extra pieces, I suggest placing 2 pipes in the middle of each shelf as pictured. It'll be as sturdy as a wooden shelf. I also mounted to wall using anti-tip brackets and zip ties (not included) and I'm confident it can hold heavier items.Assembly: Took some time, but very simple. Recommend using rubber mallet to speed up.Flexibility: Very customizable in shelf height and width of overall shelf.",

Finished product was exactly what I needed, is very sturdy, strong and great price. Would definitely recommend and would buy again.",
