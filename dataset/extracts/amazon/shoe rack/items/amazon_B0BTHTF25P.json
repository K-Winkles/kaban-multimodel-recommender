                "reviewText": "This is a great shoe rack and is mostly sturdy - mostly unless someone knocks into it. The round pieces that hold the corners sometimes fall off when this happens. It\u2019s not a hard fix, but a bit frustrating. I took off the doors because I\u2019m usually in a hurry and it\u2019s easier to access without the doors. I\u2019ve had it for 4 months and it\u2019s still as white as when I put it together. I have arthritis, so my son helped put some of the pieces on, but diagrams are provided and it was easy to put together. It holds a lot of shoes. I stacked my flip flops and sandals on top of each other for more room and was able to get 2 pair of booties in each cubicle. My son\u2019s cowboy boots were too high for the cubicles, so we store his 2 pair of size 11s on top. I rated this 4 stars because the round corner connector pieces could be remade to stay on better and be more secure. I would buy it again though.",

                "reviewText": "This is a horrible product for many reasons. First, it was missing multiple pieces, so I couldn't finish building the entire rack. The directions were horrible. They just had blurry pictures with no text, so it was a guessing game trying to assemble it. The pieces are very difficult to attach and I ended up bruising my hands after building it. It's not sturdy like the pictures. So, I am left with a so-called shoe rack, unfinished piece of crap Please consider these facts before purchasing. I'm severly disappointed, to say the least. I would give it a zero star, but i'm forced to give it a 1 on their star choice.",

I will say that they seem very durable for use however the likelihood that they would sustain being disassembled and reassembled again is low- the plastic connectors have their limits. This is exactly what I was looking for when it comes to being able to easily access and view all of my shoes. I was struggling with having everything in boxes to visualize everything I owned and this allows me to easily see and select what I need, and to put them back is a breeze vs. stacked shoe boxes and clutter.",
