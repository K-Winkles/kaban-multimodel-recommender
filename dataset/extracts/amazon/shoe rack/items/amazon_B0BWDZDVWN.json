Great build quality overall- Comes with instructions/directions leaflet in the package and assembly is super easy with snap-on parts- It is overall very stable & has no risk of falling at all- Very reasonably priced for this qualityCons:- It definitely has limitations with the shoe size. My Jordans fitted barely on the shelf so I wish it was wider",

                "reviewText": "I was really hoping that this would be good enough for my winter boots after coming in from the outside, or at least a pair of sneakers on each level with one level for boots. Unfortunately, these definitely were not made, width wise, or height, wise, for Americanized shoes. I have size 12 feet and I can\u2019t even get one shoe next to the other side-by-side. Not to mention if I do a single level, I have to squeeze them in there because the sneakers hit the top of the shelf on a single level. I ended up making two double levels, which will have to accommodate my shoes one in normally, and one on its side. If I end up keeping this, I will have to buy another set to go on top of that. I know they specify the size and I was really hoping this would fit my shoes better, but I underestimated the size. I guess it\u2019s only made for Asian feet and children\u2019s feet, measure carefully before buying! Other than that you get what you pay for, it\u2019s a bit wobbly but sturdy enough for lightweight shoes. So this would be great in a kids closet or an entryway for little kids shoes up to maybe about a size 8. It doesn\u2019t have any channels to let water drip onto so I may have to put a piece of terrycloth or microfiber on each level to absorb any wetness from the winter snow or rain. My advice, by American made it\u2019s made for American feet.",

                "reviewText": "Negative comments first from daughter: This thing really is compact, but it's so much so you can't fit my shoes in without having to shove them in a bit. There is very little room above the shoesto let airflow in, and it's not deep enough and the shoes hang out more than I'd like (almost half the heel is out) so while is technically fits I guess it's way to tight. I wear a size 10wide in women's for reference. Everything needs another 1-2inches to breath. The shelves need to be 1-2 inches higher to keep the layers from covering the shoes. That much deeper so the shoe is fully in. That much wider so they aren't being scrapped and shoved against each other to fit.Pros: easy to put together, and you could easily buy more packs and keep building on or even go on the side a bit. I think a 6 tier would be perfect for me. The 4 fits great under my desk and I could potentially get a 5th tier on it and it may still fit so it's true it's very compact.This would be great for people with small shoes to hold lots of flip flops and slippers, or for KIDS. The limited space wouldn't be a major issue with slippers or cheap flimsy flip-flops that are easy to clean and tuck away. Kids shoes being smaller will fit well with this. A older kid or young teen whose growing their shoe tastes and collection would benefit from this. Easy to shove in a closet and keep organized.",

                "reviewText": "Ho acquistato la scarpiera e sono rimasto soddisfatto del mio acquisto. Questo prodotto mi ha aiutato a mantenere il mio ingresso pulito e ordinato.La caratteristica che apprezzo di pi\u00f9 di questa scarpiera \u00e8 la sua impilabilit\u00e0. Ogni paio di scarpe ha il suo spazio separato, il che rende pi\u00f9 facile trovare quello che sto cercando e mantiene le scarpe in ordine.Un'altra caratteristica \u00e8 l'altezza regolabile. Posso facilmente rimuovere il ripiano centrale della scarpiera per creare uno spazio pi\u00f9 alto, perfetto per riporre stivali pi\u00f9 lunghi o altri oggetti come borse o piante in vaso. Questa versatilit\u00e0 mi consente di utilizzare la scarpiera per scopi diversi e sfruttare al massimo lo spazio disponibile.L'installazione della scarpiera \u00e8 stata semplice e veloce. Ci sono solo due tipi di pannelli di plastica come accessori e ho potuto completare il montaggio in pochi minuti.. Occupa poco spazio e si adatta facilmente a diversi ambienti.La stabilit\u00e0 di questa scarpiera \u00e8 un altro punto a favore. Il design del pannello a forma di U e la partizione ispessita garantiscono una maggiore stabilit\u00e0 e capacit\u00e0 di carico. Non mi preoccupo di deformazioni anche quando metto scarpe pi\u00f9 pesanti, grazie anche al bordo sollevato di ogni partizione che impedisce alle scarpe di scivolare.In conclusione, la scarpiera salvaspazio \u00e8 un buon prodotto che consiglio . \u00c8 versatile, funzionale, facile da montare e offre la soluzione ideale per mantenere le scarpe ordinate in diversi ambienti.",
