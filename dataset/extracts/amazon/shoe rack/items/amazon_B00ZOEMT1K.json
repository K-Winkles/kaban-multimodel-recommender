                "reviewText": "This shelf will need a wall to go against but gives a ton of space for shoes, looks very nice, and is pretty sturdy for the price. It is big enough, and not so sturdy that you can get away with making it free-standing. It definitely needs to be anchored to the wall. The anchors (one for each side) aren't going to let kids climb on them -- they're just drywall screws with a place to connect a zip tie. There was quite a bit of work to put them together but it isn't difficult, just tedious.These are a great value and pretty sturdy for the price. Don't confuse them with a custom shoe shelf or anything like that -- they're an inexpensive set of shoe shelves with a ton of space for a low price.",

                "reviewText": "Wow! I had my doubts that this shoe rack would live up to my expectations. So much so, that I ordered an additional shoe rack made by another company with almost identical specs from Amazon and placed it with this order (Just in case this one was a dud). Well let me just say that it's NOT A DUD, in fact it's great ! It's sturdy, well balanced and seems to be durable. I, 100%, wasn't expecting to get five pairs of a shoes to a shelf, but I was wrong. As you can see from my pics I have five pair on each shelf and one shelf has 6 pairs (flats) There's a mix of men's, women's and kids shoes, All types, sneakers, boots, heels, sandals, it's all up there and they all fit.. The heels I turned on their sides so they wouldn't wobble and even turned on their sides I still got five pair of shoes on the shelf! Putting it together was easy, well, easy once I figured out that you need to build each shelf (have all four sides in place) and then place it down onto the shelf below it, tap it down with a rubber mallet and move forward. Easy peasy took about 12 minutes. I love this shoe rack so much that I ordered two more today. Oh and I did open and assemble the other rack that I mentioned earlier and the quality just wasn't there. The shelf material was flimsy, the bars that make the length of the shelves had to be connected in the middle to achieve the length of each shelf. Whereas the songmics is one long bar, no connections in the middle. And The plastic connectors that hold everything together, they felt less durable than the songmics connectors.. Bottom line, this is a great purchase you won't be sorry!",

                "reviewText": "I used this for shoe storage in my basement (on carpet), and because it's not a perfectly flat surface, I had to attach it to the wall at the top/back in order to ensure it would not fall over when full. That being said, it does seem fairly sturdy, and I don't think it would be a problem on hardwood/concrete/tile, etc. It did take a bit of time to put together as it comes in a lot of small parts (2 rods per \"shelf\" - a long piece of canvas with holes along each side, 4 plastic connectors per shelf, and then 4 small rods in between each \"shelf\"). Once I got the hang of it (one the 4th shelf or so), it went a lot faster, just don't miss a part or put the bracket the wrong way! Overall, I'm very happy with it! If you have ankle boots with more than 6-7 inches of height they'll have to squeeze in a bit, but for flatter shoes/runners/sandals, it's great, and I was able to fit more pairs per row, about 6 pairs of runners or 8 pairs of sandals!Would buy again for sure!",
