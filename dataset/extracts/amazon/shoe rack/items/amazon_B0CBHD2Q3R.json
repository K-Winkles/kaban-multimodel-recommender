I wiped down every piece and let it air out over night but the smell was just as strong. There were a couple of chipped pieces but I decided to put it together anyway. The \u201cpillars\u201d are wrapped and look like they will peel. Overall the size is perfect for what I needed. For the quality I think it\u2019s overpriced. I\u2019m keeping it because I need it. Hopefully the smell fades away soon. I\u2019ve included pictures. Hope this review helps.",

                "reviewText": "The shoe rack is 45 in tall 9 and 1/2 in wide and one foot deep. The platforms for the shoes are decent, but the laminating on the dowel rods is not too great. On some pieces the laminate is actually loose. And the threaded holes in the dowels aren't exactly centered or straight up and down. But once it's all together it looks fine. It comes with everything you need to put it together, including one of the worst screwdrivers I've ever seen, but hey at least it comes with a screwdriver. It probably took all of 7 minutes to put together, and it will hold seven pairs of shoes unless you use the top then it will hold eight. It comes with some stick-on rubber feet for the bottom. Some of the pieces are made very well, but once it's put together, you really can't tell.",

                "reviewText": "These shelves needed assembly, but it was pretty easy and obvious how to do that. And while I did notice some small flaws as I screwed the dowels in, I shouldn't have worried. Once it was completely assembled, it looked great. Really pretty, and really steady and stable. I absolutely love it. Honestly, for the price, I was surprised at how attractive this set of little shelves is. Granted, it's not a perfect, high-end piece of wooden furniture, but it also doesn't cost hundreds of dollars. (For a comparable price, there are several versions of those wobbly plastic, 4 or 5 shelf units at my local big DIY store, but I'd much rather have this graceful, wooden, space-saving 7-tier rack. Any day.)Bottom line these little shelves are a perfect solution for any medium-sized, awkwardly-shaped things, (including but not limited to shoes), that need to be accessible, but are always so hard to organize neatly. (I have lots of that kind of stuff around my house.)Initially, I set it on the counter in my kitchen, and it served to keep a bunch of that awkward-to-organize holiday-related stuff out of the way, but still organized and accessible. In a very small footprint on the countertop. But once all the holiday stuff went back into storage, it left my little shelves pretty empty. But in the process of cleaning out our workshop, (danged resolutions), I realized these shelves are just perfect for holding those awkward, mid-sized tools. Like vibrating sanders, skill saws, heat guns, small cordless drills, big glue guns, soldering irons, and the like. And it fits just perfectly on the top of the worktable, going almost all the way to the ceiling. The shelves are just exactly the right size for the tools. And, set wide end out, they're also just the right size to hold a shoebox-sized acrylic bin, perfectly! And you can see in the side of the shoebox easily, from across the room. (Sadly, the PP or PE plastic shoeboxes have slanted sides, so the tops are just a bit too wide. Especially with the lids on. They'll fit sideways, but then the ends stick out and it's harder to see what's in them.)I just love the way this shelving unit stores and organizes so much awkwardly-shaped stuff accessibly, in a teensy footprint. So much so that I'm planning on putting another one at the other end of the workshop table. (Even though these shelves are still way too pretty for the rest of the workshop, I'm working on it.)This is a reasonably priced and very attractive solution for organizing and storing any kind of mid-sized, awkwardly-shaped stuff you still need access to -- even shoes! -- vertically, over an amazingly small footprint.",

The shelf legs are covered in a cheap plastic even though the description says its sturdy wood. The space to place shoes isn't as large as it looks in the picture. It' fine for a closet or bedroom where it isn't seen by anyone, I wouldn't put it in an open space because it isn't the sturdy.",

The laminate on the dowels is very loose, and the screw ends aren't centered true into the dowel, meaning the dowels install at a tilt instead of straight up and down. It makes putting together the thing a pain. The seams on the laminate shelves are also hit and miss. And then the instructions aren't complete on how the top is installed. Though that is intuitive enough. However it does leave screw heads exposed on the top shelf which is not depicted in the photos.All in all, can not recommend.",
