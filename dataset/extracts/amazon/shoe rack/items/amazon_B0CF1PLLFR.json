                "reviewText": "As my headline stated. This shoe rack comes preassembled and all you have to do is stretch it out and click the locks on the sides of rack. And its good to go. It holds 6 pair of shoes or sneakers easily. The opening between each section is 6 1/4 inches. So it can only hold shoes no boots. It is all made of hard plastic. So it can crack if your not careful. But so far I've had no problems with this shoe rack. It holds 6 pairs of sneakers no problem. Just don't put any heavy boots and it will hold. Now the reason for the 4 stars. I had this on a rug that had a little fold on it. So I didn't notice it and I put this shoe rack on top of the fold and within a week I noticed that the shoe rack starting tilting on one side. So I moved it to a even floor and it corrected itself straight. So it does flex when not put on an even flooring. So an even floor is highly recommended when you place it. But this was designed to fit in small spaces and that's a plus.",

                "reviewText": "This foldable shoe rack works well for me to expand storing my shoes in my closet. It is tall and narrow, so it fits in a narrow space in my closet. It was fairly easy to assemble, just snap the pieces together. You have to make sure the sides are secure, or the tower will fall. The shoe openings are large enough to hold tennis shoes, flip flops, slides, slippers, or loafers. Ankle boots fit if you place them in a specific way (on their sides). I'd recommend placing this tower in a corner as it could fall over if you accidentally knock it. Also, the fake wood pattern is a little cheesy, but the shoe storage is functional, so I am ok with the looks.",
