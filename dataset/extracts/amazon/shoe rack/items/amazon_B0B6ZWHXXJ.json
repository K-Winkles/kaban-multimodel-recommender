Other than color, the biggest difference I see is the corner fittings on this model are more substantial (a positive). I love the style because it holds a lot of shoes and they don't collect dust when not worn.It's light but sturdy. I gave my previous version 4 stars because I wasn't sure how the thin vinyl shelves would hold up. But I can report that after 6 1/2 years it's held up fine even with the shelves being overloaded.It took me just over an hour to put together. Nothing complicated and no tools required. More like a repetitive process building the shelves (I did it watching TV). This one came with 2 extra connectors.While both only have 9 shelves, I use the top as a 10th shelf to hold my boots. Nit picking but I do wish the vinyl shelves were a bit longer so I could squeeze in a 4th pair of (women's) shoes across :) (When I do, they slip through the gap). My original had some shelves stuffed with flats stacked on top of each other - why I finally decided to buy another one. Yes, I have a major shoe problem.The fact that it's very affordable is a bonus.",
