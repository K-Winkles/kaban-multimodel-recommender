The only drawback is that it comes on assembled, and at first glance is daunting to look at when you open the box but all in all it went together fairly easy once I figured everything out. I like the fact that it has the dividers to go down the side as well, so nothing can fall out. Some of them are made open on the sides which is problematic.",
