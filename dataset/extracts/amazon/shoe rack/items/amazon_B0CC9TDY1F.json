(Iguess I didn't read the description.) I was doubtful when I began assembling the first shelf and it was crooked. But, after a little adjusting and a few taps with the included wooden mallet, it was very easy to put together. I took my time and it took about 45 minutes to put together.It is sturdy, holds 20 pairs of shoes and doesn't take up much floor space.It is tall and might be tippy if a little one pulls on it. If you have small children you might want to think about securing it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice, very light, and inexpensive shoe rack that does the job well. I have on display women shoe sizes 6, 5, and big kid size 4.5; And each row can hold 4 pairs of shoes. The design allows a bit of room for some ingenuity to fit what you need so I was able to create a higher row for boots that I need to place on there as well. The sturdiness is good as long as small children don't try to be Spiderman on it. Leaving it alone, it will never tip over.Overall, this was a great purchase. I like its minimalist footprint, and do recommend it.",
