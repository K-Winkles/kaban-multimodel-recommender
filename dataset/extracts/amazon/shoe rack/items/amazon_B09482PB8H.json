The picture is a little deceiving so definitely go by the measurements that are provided. I would definitely buy this product again if and when I need another one. One of the waterproof cloths that shoes sit on is ripped.",

It's been up in our closet for about a month now and is holding up well, it just doesn't feel very sturdy and I would be careful bumping into it, especially if you have heavy shoes on the top. The assembly was pretty easy, took me less than an hour to put together. Overall happy with it for the price.",
