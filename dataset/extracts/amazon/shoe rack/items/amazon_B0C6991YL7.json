It is strong enough to hold a good amount of different sized shoes. It is made of a great quality of wood and is also light weight. Great addition to my front closet and is exactly what we needed!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s sturdy, fairly easy to assemble and a blank canvas. The wood parts can be painted or stained to your liking. I left mine how they are for now. The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that one of the silver bars where you screw into, the white piece was pushed so far down into the bar that I couldn\u2019t get the screw to screw into it. I had to get a small tool to pull it up higher so that I could screw in the last screw. If I wasn\u2019t able to fix it, one of the bars would\u2019ve been loose and wobbly. I\u2019m glad it worked out. It\u2019s a nice size shoe rack that\u2019s sturdy and adjustable.",
