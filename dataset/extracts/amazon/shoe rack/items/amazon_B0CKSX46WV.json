                "reviewText": "Very easy to assemble -- just press short metal tubes into formed holes in plastic supports. The instructions are easy to follow and includes pictures, quantities, and supplementary notes. A small wooden mallet is provided to assist in tapping the tubes all the way in. The only other tool needed is a screwdriver to attach the anti-tip-over bracket into the wall. I highly recommend this \"optional\" step as this is a very light rack and can easily tip over due to it's height.All of the tubes fit into the plastic supports well, and the whole structure is light, but sturdy enough to hold a bunch of shoes and boots -- and holding a bunch of shoes this does! My wife fit two pairs of footwear per shelf, totaling 35 pairs of shoes and 5 pairs of boots onto the rack. (There is still room for 1 more pair of each in this layout.) They also provided end-brackets for the very top shelf so that you can store items there as well. (My wife used this for several more pairs of boxed boots.)Overall, this shoe rack is super functional, sturdy enough for the task, and a good value for storing many shoes and boots.",
