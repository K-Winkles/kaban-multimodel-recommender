                "reviewText": "I bought this 10 tier shoe rack for my small laundry room. Great value for the money. My family has too many shoes and I needed a rack that could hold at least 40 additional shoes, and this does the job! I can fit all our gym shoes, boots, sandals, heels, and more. It was pretty easy to assemble all by myself as a mom. It took about an hour putting all the separate metal pieces together. It does require a bit of work but everything comes packaged nicely and easy to figure out. Patience and snacks is also required because there are a lot of individual pieces you have to attach to build to ten tiers. It also has a light weight fabric cover you can roll down to cover your shoes if needed. And there\u2019s a couple of side pockets you can store accessories such as shoe spray, keys, or hats etc. It\u2019s worth the labor because at the end you have a reliable, sturdy, nothing fancy, but nice looking shelf that does the job of holding up to 40 pairs of shoes. My shoes are now organized and I am not tripping over them. Buy it, you won\u2019t be disappointed!",

I had so much extra space, I got excited when I saw I still have more space to buy more shoes! This was so easy to assemble and I love that it has a complete cover so I can close it and protect my shoes from the dust as well. It's sturdy and slim so it doesn't take up much space in my garage. It is a great way to organize my shoes while keeping them clean and out of the way. There was one little problem when I was assembling it, where a link was incorrect on the pole, but I could easily figure it out myself and correct it. A great purchase to help me organize my home.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this because I need a place for our shoes that is not the floor; plus, living in CA gives me the option of using our outdoor space (covered porch) for stuff like this. It's pretty lightweight, which is nice for moving around, however, it's super flimsy and the materials don't seem like they'll last. I can't imagine this little shoe shelf would make it through a move, and disassembling would be a pain. Actually, similar to ikea products, I don't think it's made to disassemble and reassemble more than the one time original assembly. Aside from cheap and lightweight components, one of the zippers is missing the little pull, which wouldn't be a big deal except that 1) this is a brand new item and should have all its parts, and 2) the low quality of the material means the zipper gets stuck on the way up and down, and having a pull would make the crappy zipper slightly easier to operate. Yes, I could complain to the manufacturer but they will ask me to return it for a replacement, and I do not want to go through all that disassembly, packing, traipsing to the post office, and then RE-assembling the new one when it arrives. I just don't have it in me. I'd rather spend that time doing something of more value, like complaining about it in the reviews.",
