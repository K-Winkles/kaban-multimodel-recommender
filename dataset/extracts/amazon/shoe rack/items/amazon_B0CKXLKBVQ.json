I gave it 4 stars for two reasons: 1. One of the pieces cracked when I was pushing it into place, so not necessarily very durable but durable enough to do the job well (just don't put anything significantly heavy on it) 2. The wooden hammer they provided to put the rack together broke in the middle of the build. If the company is going to provide tools to build their items, they should not be flimsy.I would still most definitely recommend this rack. In fact after 3 people saw the results, I was asked to remodel their closets - ha!",

Only recommendation to future buyers would be to follow the photo instructions step by step because if you attach from the bottom up but then realize a metal piece should've been at the bottom, then its difficult to fit it in after and could make the whole thing wobbly if you dont fit the lower pieces im sturdy enough. Did not need the little hamme (it actually doesnt do much anyways), any semi-strong human can get it done. Definitely worth the purchase and price was good.",
