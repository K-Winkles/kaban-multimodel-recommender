This is exactly what it looks like and does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do. I took off one star because a chunk one of the plastic pieces actually broke off when assembling. But it\u2019s still functional and it\u2019s a cheap unit. I\u2019m happy with it.",

We didn't have any super glue, so I used Plumbers Putty(in the hole where the poles go). I let it dry for about 30 min + then I put my shoes back on paying carful attention this time to weight distribution. I found putting the majority of ur heavy shoes on the bottom racks was better, then it wasn't so overwhelmed by the weight of my Docs on the top rack.",
