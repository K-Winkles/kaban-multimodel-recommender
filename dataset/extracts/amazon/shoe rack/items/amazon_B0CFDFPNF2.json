It's become the unofficial drop-off spot for my roomies' duffle bags and laptop cases, blocking access to my own stuff stashed inside. Enter this shoe rack, not just for shoes; it's a new surface for those bags!I'll be straight with you\u2014it's a tad flimsy. But hey, it does what it's supposed to do. The height was a surprise (taller than expected), which turned out to be a bonus. It's like a mini skyscraper for shoes and bags. However, I was hoping for it to be wider. I guess you can't have everything.If you're in a similar boat\u2014needing extra space in a shared living situation\u2014this could be a handy solution. Just don't expect it to be the sturdiest piece of furniture in your home. It's more of a lightweight, functional fix.",

                "reviewText": "My shoes are currently sitting in a big box so I need something to sort them out. This shoe rack is just the right thing I need! It is sturdy and was easy to put together. I don't have a huge collection of shoes so it fits all of them on it. I also like that now I can see all of the shoes that I have instead of digging through a box trying to remember what I have. Its worth the price and I really like that I can add a little decor like a couple plants and pictures to the top.",

                "reviewText": "This shoe organizer was easy to build and finishes nicely. It's sturdy and fits several pairs of shoes. It took about half an hour to build. Once done, it looks great by the front door hall of my living room. It's wide for many shoes, yet slim for compact storage. I use the top for purses, a basket for keys and wallets, and setting down small items for a moment once I walk in the door while I get settled into my home. The materials are particle board for the top. The top is two small boards that line up together to make the longer board illusion. The frame is thin metal that snaps and screws together. The shelves are thin and stiff canvas like material. My only strife with this set is that the shelves don't all sit at the same height. There's no direct way to change this either. It's not very noticeable but; it was odd to notice once I was done building it. Perhaps I installed something upside down? I'm unsure. I followed the directions as clearly as the were layed out. If I did make human error; the instructions weren't layed out in a way to prevent it. Overall, it still looks great and functions well. I'm very happy with it and am pleased with the display and organization. I think it has nice value",

                "reviewText": "This shoe rack is deeper than many - too deep for a hallway. So I put it in my closet. Make sure you check the measurements before buying. It's also very top heavy - which is why it comes with the hardware to anchor it to the wall (something I don't like doing). So I turned it upside down so the heavy part (wood) is at the bottom. No anchors needed. :)The quality isn't the best - one of the rods was bent so it was a little difficult to insert, but I got it. Easy to assemble but the instructions skipped the part where you need to get the rotation of the upper bars in place before putting the wooden top on. Once it's put together it's wobbly. Another need for anchors. Also, I don't wear heels but I don't see how high heeled shoes would stand up very well on this either. Maybe if you poke holes through the fabric where the heel would go to keep them from falling over, that might work.",

                "reviewText": "This shoe rack was long needed and provided additional storage space to my apartment which was greatly appreciated. Before, there were shoes in various designated areas. Now they are all in a single location with a tiered system providing a platform for them. This system allows the shoes to be selected with ease and has been a benefit to getting ready for work in a timely manner. It's also an aesthetic choices with the shoes looking as if they were on display. Overall I'm greatly satisfied with it and the design is quite sturdy. The fabric is soft however and may not be resistant to tears and may have to be disassembled to wash it, so ensure the shoes aren't overly dirty before placing them on the rack if you're at all concerned.I recommend this for anyone with more than 5 pairs of shoes in the house. It's a great fit and will likely add much more space to your dwelling. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps",
