I ordered it as a way to store and organize video game controllers that were previously sitting in a tangle of wires in front of my TV. It would also be suitable for decorative items or pretty much anything that's not too heavy.It's easy to assemble. The shelves are somewhat modular, though given the narrow base and light weight I don't think I'd stack them much higher than 7 shelves in a single unit. (At least, not without finding a way to stabilize the resulting unit.)The materials feel pretty flimsy to me, but being bamboo it probably is stronger than it seems. Nonetheless, I wouldn't use it for storing books or anything very heavy. Still, for either its advertised purpose (shoes) or the purpose for which I bought it, it's a perfectly good storage solution that can fit into a small space.",

Very light weight yet seems sturdy.Has a very nice small foot print.I would have like to have the flexibility to have them lay sideways but the leg design doesn't give you that option...but other than that, it looks great and is holding all the shoes that were on the floor now...much less tacky in the hallway now.",

                "reviewText": "This bamboo 7-tier shelving unit is well made, it takes a small footprint on the floor and is approx. 10\" X 11\" X 42\". The organizer is versatile as it can store shoes, purses, books, cleaning supplies, towels and much more. It is easy to install with no tools needed; however, some of the legs were missing stain in some areas. At $24 at the time of this writing, it is also priced right.",
