            "SOLID BAMBOO MATERIALS: Bamboo is a stronger material than wood and will last longer. Thus, we choose renewable resource bamboo that grows in natural alpine areas. The texture is strong load-bearing, stable and durable. Each layer of the free standing shoe racks has a high load-bearing capacity. After the product is carbonized at a high temperature, it is waterproof and not easy to crack and deform.",
            "EASY TO ASSEMBLE: We have upgraded the connection method of the shoe holder and no longer used plastic connectors to connect it, which greatly increases the stability of the shoe storage and avoids bending in the middle of the shoe rack. And the assembly process of the shoe shelf is simple and easy to understand, and everything needed will be included, so there is no need to search for tools. We will also include an installation tutorial for the small shoe rack for reference.",
            "WIDE RANGE OF USES\uff1aUndoubtedly, this small shoe rack for entryway small space will keep your shoes in order. In addition, this shoe stand also has many other functions. It can be used as a bookshelf or flower rack in the living room or bedroom, as well as a towel rack in the bathroom, or even a small box for holding handicrafts, or anywhere you need to store things.",
            "STACKABLE DESIGN: Whenever trying to save space or make room, we find ourselves stacking things one on top of the other. This organization and storage shelf was designed with perfect tenon design without stacking tools. As you see the top shelf has a little protrusion that allows for stacking. The shoe racks are connected by embedding grooves between the upper and lower frames. You can stack them to save space in the room while gaining additional storage.",
            "QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE: Thank you for choosing our product, you didn't just get a great vertical shoe rack--you also supported our growth, which is pretty cool(at least we think so). We have always cherished every customer who trusts us. We hope your shopping experience is better than ever before, and we are standing by to help you if you have any problems! To make you 100% satisfied is our developing goal!"

                "reviewText": "From reading the recent reviews it seems this is hit or miss and some people certainly get duds that aren't worth their weight in salt. I shouldn't have risked it, honestly. I'm not picky and wasn't expecting much but found myself forcing this together to no avail. It could be the \"natural\" color is worse than the others, but the plastic connectors for the middle of the selves actually don't fit properly. I spent a lot of time trying to force them together and can get them on each side a few millimeters but they pop off with no weight on the shelves at all. I shouldn't have even bothered building the shelves but that was very difficult, too. The holes are too small for the screws so I certainly needed pliers to force the Allen wrench that came with it to turn more than a few times. I am surprised I didn't break the Allen wrench. I'm relatively strong so if it says \"no extra tools needed\" I shouldn't have had to do this and still work up such a sweat for so long. So now I have these shelves that I can't really put anything on. The description says each one can bear 40 pounds! That's actually funny, even if the connectors did fit there's just no way and we all know it. I would send this back but disassembling it and figuring out how to put all the pieces back in the box hardly seems worth it.",
