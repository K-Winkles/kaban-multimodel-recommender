                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nifty Little Rack!",
                "reviewText": "I needed a relatively narrow, low profile shoe rack to organise a few pairs of shoes behind my back door. I use all of them regularly, so I was not keen to put them in boxes in the closet and dig them out as needed each day although that would have saved me the money I spent on this shoe rack and kept the area behind the door looking and feeling more open and spacious.However, as my few closets are already bursting at the seams, I opted for a shoe rack and began looking at tons of them on-line. Many that are available are quite wide, but I needed something between 17\" to 19.\" 17\" would have been ideal for the floor space, but it would have meant a tight fit between athletic shoes, Crocs, etc. This rack came in right around the 19.5\" width which is a little bit wider than would have been absolutely ideal, but it nevertheless fits in the space, and it holds my shoes comfortably close together. It will hold up to 6 pairs of shoes on the shelves, and you can fit another 2 pairs of low profile shoes such as slippers, flip flops, etc., on the ground beneath the bottommost shelf.This rack is slightly wider, slightly more expensive, but also slightly more decorative looking than another small bamboo shoe rack I looked at on Amazon. This rack also looked a little more sturdy in the photos. Reviews were positive, so I opted for this one and am not sorry in my choice.This rack did come with an assembly diagram, but assembly is highly intuitive and simple especially if you look at the photo on the listing. No tools were needed. I assembled it in 5 minutes. I am happy to say it is pretty sturdy---certainly sturdy enough to hold 6 pairs of shoes or something of similar or slightly more weight. I am not worried about this rack collapsing if used properly and not overloaded. I reserved the very top shelf for my handbag, gloves, and hat (it is Winter as I type this), but it could hold a variety of things, e.g. your garden gloves and garden snips, or a stack of post, or even 2-3 books, etc.I chose the natural bamboo colour because black absorbs light, and because the area where I placed this rack is already pretty dark. I did not want to make it look even darker. Also, I considered that I may paint this rack eventually, and the lighter colour bamboo will be more easily covered by a light coloured paint. I thought perhaps an antique white colour would make it look a little more expensive and allow it to better coordinate with my decor. There are so many fabulous paint colours these days, though, that the colour options are in the hundreds. You can even have a store match a colour that already exists in your home, so all things considered, I preferred the natural bamboo colour.Some buyers opted to buy multiple racks and stack them, and I must say that looks like a great idea from the photos some buyers posted (thank you for sharing your photos!). If you stacked these racks for shoes, you could add 2x or 3x more shoes without sacrificing space to width as so many larger shoe racks dictate. I have a relatively narrow wall behind the door in my loo where 2-3 of these racked stacked would make wonderful open storage. I am seriously considering buying 1-2 more of these racks.This rack easily doubles as a little table or a bookcase or a storage area for DVD's, too. It even seems sturdy enough to hold a printer (albeit not a huge or heavy one), and have space on the 2 bottom shelves for printer paper and other accoutrements. Another bonus that you may need one day is that it easily disassembles for storage and/or moving. It is lightweight but not so lightweight as to feel flimsy. So, once again, overall for the price point of $25 shipped via Prime, the quality to price ratio is good. I do not think I would pay more than $25 for it, though. This a nifty little rack. Recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I needed something for the corner of my closet to fit my gym shoes and it had to be vertical. This was perfect for my needs. I had it put together in about 15 minutes, everything just screws in. It's super light weight. A little bit wobbly but I don't plan to put anything heavy on top. Be careful not to overtighten the pieces or they will crack. Had it happen once, but since I only used 6 of the 7 shelves it ended up being ok. Even if I had needed the 7th, it would have been ok. Just be careful to not over tighten.",

                "reviewText": "This unit comes in a lightweight box that measures 10 inches x 12 inches x 4.5 inches tall. There are NO instructions but thanks to other reviews I saw here, it was easy to figure out how to attach the dowels for the tiers. I didn't actually use this for storing shoes - I stored bathroom supplies - and I ended up stacking 3 units on top of each other to maximize the space.Unfortunately because of how the dowels between the tiers are drilled, if you choose to combine multiple units you can't actually connect all of the tiers you're given - for example, 1 unit has 3 tiers, but if you stack 2 units together you can only connect 5 tiers total (not 6), and if you stack 3 units together you can only connect 7 tiers total (not 9). The price is great, and it's sturdy enough (it wobbles a little if it's on carpet rather than a bare floor, even when it's empty).Helpful dimensions:1 unit:--3 tiers--measures 19.5 inches wide x 11 inches deep x 22 inches tall (including the finials on the top tier)--4 inches from the floor to the bottom of the lowest tier--8 inches clearance in between tiers--0.5 inch between each of the slats on a tier2 units stacked on top of each other:--5 tiers total--measures 19.5 inches wide x 11 inches deep x 39 inches tall (including the finials on the top tier)3 units stacked on top of each other:--7 tiers total--measures 19.5 inches wide x 11 inches deep x 55 inches tall (including the finials on the top tier)",

I couldn\u2019t fit boots anywhere except the top level but I wouldn\u2019t want them dripping down on other shoes anyway. This is ideal for shoe closet storage rather than near the door storage. It\u2019s pretty sturdy, one of my family members wears a men\u2019s size 16 so those shoes are substantial. The stand itself is light and easy to move around.
