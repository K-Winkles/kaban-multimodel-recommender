This product was perfect and am on my way to getting another one!! It was incredibly easy to assemble and took no less than 30 minutes. Instructions were clear and to the point and has tons of storage. The shoe rack itself is pretty durable which surprised me. I love the curtain like flap which can be zipped and cover anything you have in there!!! The extra pockets in the side help as just hiding any tidbits and such!! Highly recommend!",

It took about 20 minutes, but that's because you have to connect the metal pieces together before you insert metal into non-woven fabric.It's sturdy and fits a lot of shoes. Also, it works well as hat storage. great buy for $30",

I've always used wood furniture, so I was iffy about this shoe rack not being made of wood. It does have a drop-down feature to hide the shoes but it is not an eyesore so we leave it open. Lastly, the price of this shoe rack is super affordable; if you're looking for a shoe rack to hold a large amount of shoes...look no further!",
