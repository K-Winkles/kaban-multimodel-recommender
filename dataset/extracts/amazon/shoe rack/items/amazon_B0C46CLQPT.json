It's pretty sturdy for the price. fits my size 7 women's shoes. Doesn't fit tall boots but that's fine with me. Doesn't fit my husband's size 14W very well (they fit but stick out) but I didn't buy it for him. I purchase a second one so I could have 2 stacks of 6 high which fits in my closet well. Looks good. I'm satisfied with product.",

I went through like 50 racks to try to find one that would specifically fit in this spot. Anyway, incredibly easy to put together and good clearance for most shoes. While not necessary, I used double-pointed tacks/staples (available from most hardware stores - Canadian Tire in Canada) to secure this to the hanging storage/bench beside it. Awesome for tight horizontal spaces. Looks great!",
