            "\u3010LARGE CAPACITY & SPACE SAVING\u3011 This tall narrow shoe rack is ideal for small spaces with dimensions of 11.8\"L x 17.1\"W x62.9\"H. It can store up to 16-20 pairs of shoes. You can detach one layer and make it into a high compartment to place your tall boots, bags, or large storage boxes. Besides, the shoe rack organizer comes with 5 versatile hooks for hanging keys, umbrellas, bags, etc, a very practical design for maximizing vertical spaces.",
            "\u3010HIGH STABILITY AND DURABLE\u3011The 8-tier tall shoe rack are made from strengthened pp connectors, waterproof non-woven fabric layers, and powder-coated metal pipes, providing good stability and preventing rust. The waterproof fabric layers can effectively prevent dust, water, or mud from falling into other shoes. Most importantly, it\u2019s much more suitable for storing high heels. No more falling through the slots.",
            "\u3010STACKABLE & DIVIDABLE SHOE SHELVES\u3011The metal vertical shoe rack can be split into two 4-tier shoe racks to fit any narrow or tiny space perfectly. Or you can order two packs and build them together as a large shoe rack that can hold all family member\u2019s shoes and keep organized. The free standing shoe racks can be freely disassembled and stacked, and can be matched as you like to meet your storage needs for different types of shoes and different scenarios.",
            "\u3010MORE SPACE, LESS CLUTTER\u3011The size of the shoe storage organizer can be a good collection of your shoes, boots, books, or other accessories. Won\u2019t wobble or topple, even when fully loaded with 20 pairs of shoes! The distance of 7.87\u201d between the shelves is spacious enough to hold shoes of most types. The corner shoe rack is ideal for closets, entryways, dorms, apartments, hallways.",
            "\u3010EASY TO ASSEMBLE\u3011We provide you with illustrated instructions and labeled parts to make installing the closet shoe organizer easy, you can spend less time assembling. Tips: Due to thermal expansion and contraction, when the weather is cold, soak the pp connectors in warm water for a few minutes, and will be better for assembling.",

If you have any questions about the slim shoe racks(such as missing parts, parts damaged, or shoe rack installation), Please feel free to contact us, we will reply to you in time, and provide the perfect solutions to you."

This particular shoe rack proved very easy to assemble, sturdy, and yet lightweight. It also allows you to remove or reposition shelves to accommodate tall shoes and boots. Three pairs per shelf seems enough, very accesible and easy to move around as a loaded unit if need be. Highly recommended!",

We take our shoes off when we enter the house, and there was a massive disorganized pile of shoes around the entry.Assembly - This product is very easy to assemble. My 7 year old and I completed the build in less than 5 minutes. Interestingly, we decided, instead of one tall rack, to turn it into two shorter racks. No problem, easy assembly.Use - Turned the entire mess of shoes we had into an organized, visibly attractive looking enterprise. This isn't high end, but it's not cheap and brittle either. We've used this for around a week at this point. The kids like it because they get their own sections. The adults like it because it freed up floor space and was quick to put together.Overall, I'd definitely recommend it, if you are considering purchasing it.",

And it's cute as a shelf as well if you don't want to put only shoes on it. It's not the most sturdy so don't step on it or put heavy things on top of it. It's good for a temporary use which is what I needed.",
