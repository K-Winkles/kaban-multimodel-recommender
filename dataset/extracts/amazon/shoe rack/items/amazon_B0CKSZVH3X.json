                "reviewText": "This unit requires a considerable bit of assembly. It's nothing difficult, but there are a lot of parts and it can look a little overwhelming at a glance. The assembly is a bit tedious and some parts can be stubborn. (They include a mallet they say to use when attaching the end connectors, but I found this pretty much useless; I ended up setting each shelf upright once both connectors were attached, then pressing it together with a moderate but continuous force - more or less \"leaning\" onto the top connector - instead of trying to pound it home with their mallet).Also be aware - there are instructions, but they may be a bit hidden. I found them tucked inside the folded up cloth shelves.Once assembled, it's a pretty good sized shelving unit. It's not quite 6 foot tall and a few inches short of 3 feet wide. There are 9 shelves (and two drawers sized to fit on one of the shelves) for a total of about 280 linear inches of shelf space, with a depth of 10 inches. The metal tube frame is probably pretty sturdy, but note that the shelves are some sort of synthetic fabric stretched over the frame - so it's not going to be suitable for books or other heavy items, or anything that really needs a stable surface to sit on. For the advertised purpose - a shoe rack - it would be fine. It's also good for light display items. I'm using it to store a bunch of video game accessories that were just cluttered the room where my TV is.It's light enough to be easy to move. The assembly is somewhat modular (so you could, for example, make a couple lower shelving units). As long as you pay attention to the limitations of what it is, it works great and provides a lot of storage space for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This has been an amazing help with getting things organized around the house. We have so many shoes in our house that they inevitably add to the Clutter and spill into each room. I installed this in a hallway closet and designated the space exclusively for shoes since it has a nice ventilation at the top and always seems to be a catch-all for junk. Once I built the shoe rack we noticed how much easier it is to keep the house clean and organized. I looked everywhere for a rack with the capacity as much as this one and I'm glad I found this. The assembly did take some time and is a bit tedious but it's not hard to do it just takes a while. This is built similarly to most of the units although the hardware is a bit more heavy duty due to its large size. Really happy with this unit, it's helped a lot.",

                "reviewText": "This is exactly what I needed. The box came and had detailed instructions how to put it together. It was not difficult but time consuming. The metal is solid and the material that the shelves are made of is durable. I have over the door hangers and the wooden boxes for shoes as well as a box to put in the bottom of the closet. None of them really are made for people who love shoes. I need space and they needed to have space between. Having no defining boarder makes that significantly easier. There really is enough space that this could be perfect for a drop zone for the family all to share. It isn't designed to last twenty years but it is good quality and durable. It is far nicer than most other similar products. If you are a shoe person or looking for some family storage this is the way to go.",

                "reviewText": "The rack came in quickly and with no issues. The Bepatio shoe rack 9-tier is a large shoe rack made for 36-45 pairs of shoes. It is a stackable shoe shelf that has removable cloth drawers that also with a small metal side 4-hook. The rack has vinyl for the shelving that works ok, not very stable for high heels. The legs snap or clip together and can come apart over time. The rack is very lightweight and made for light use. I like it but wonder how long it will last.",
