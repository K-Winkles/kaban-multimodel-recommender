I bought a white one for my laundry room and liked it so much I bought a brown one for my foyer. No more balancing to take off/put on shoes. The bench even has a shoe rack which comes in handy. It's also the perfect height for a toddler to stand on and help wash dishes! I am extremely happy with the benches and would highly recommend.",

We have it in our entry and it\u2019s perfect for our mail bin, our house shoes and our basket of \u201cstuff\u201d like keys, sunglasses, gum... The cube holds our gloves, hats and dog sweaters. I toss my purse on the bench when I come in and grab my house shoes. Love it!",

                "reviewText": "I would love to say that this product was easy to assemble, however, if you do not pay attention to threading the bolts correctly through the nuts, then they will shred, and it will be very difficult to get the bolts to screw in. I had this happen on two of the bolts where they did not easily go into the nut inside of the metal legs. it took nearly 30 minutes to get some cooperation from it and a lot of hand strength all because the bolt was not started off correctly. Luckily an extra bolt was provided which I can see why it\u2019s really needed. Besides that the unit is a little small for a person with size 11 1/2 shoe. I can barely can fit in three pairs across. I think the unit probably is fine for people with size 10 or smaller shoes and it\u2019s pretty stable to sit on and use. In hindsight, I probably would\u2019ve chose another unit for the price point that is being advertised.",
