The dowels that hold the tiers are thick and sturdy and the entire unit is easy to assemble. It looks nice and my very active cat has yet to be able to knock it over. My only criticism is that I wish they made one with two tiers so I could fit all the shoes. Buy a couple.",

                "reviewText": "Wow this is game changer! I wanted to store shoes but not have it take up our entry way and holy Toledo this is amazing. It fits my husbands size 13 shoes and I can fit several pairs of my toddlers shoes in one slot. It was super easy to put together as I watched my toddler all by myself. It is sturdy and looks good. My parents saw it after I put it up who live in an RV full time and wanted to know where I got it because they are constantly looking for space saving things. I love it so much I plan to purchase another one for the other side of my door because we are a family with a lot of shoes! I will say go with this brand because I loved the sturdiness I wanted to get one of a black color for my laundry room, it was roughly the same price, much smaller, couldn\u2019t fit my husbands 13 size shoes, and not as nice. I plan to use it as shelves in my laundry room and not a shoe rack so it worked out but for a shoe rack it is no where comparable to this one. Look no further your space saving shoe rack is this one!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to store my son's shoes, which is good since my husband's shoes hang over the edge (as shown in pic). It's super easy to put together. My 4 y/o put it together with only a little help from me. It seems pretty sturdy for its use. At some point, I'll need to buy something to anchor it. I wish it came with a wall anchor but it's nbd. It was a tight squeeze to get the boards over the screws on the ends of the dowels but the dowels cover any cracks it causes so it's no harm done. I think the price fits the product. It comes with 6 little white stickers to cover the screw holes. You only need 3, which is a good thing because 3 stickers fell off the backing while in transit (as shown in pic) but, again, no harm done. The box it came in was pretty beat up. The materials were in the box without any packing material or protective coverings (which is better for the environment) so I'm surprised there wasn't any damage to the boards. Still, overall very pleased with the finished product. Super happy my son could assemble it. It really made him happy. He loves to help with projects like this.",

                "reviewText": "Some reviews mention the veneer getting cracked by the screws going through the holes. This happened to me on the very first piece, but the damage is hidden and I was able to finish the job without any more issues:You assemble by screwing 3 posts to a shelf, add a shelf, add 3 posts, shelf, posts, etc. to the top.When you add 3 posts, LEAVE THEM SLIGHTLY LOOSE so they have a little wobble/play in them. This allows them to move while you put on the next shelf. Then tighten the posts the last turn or so, add the next posts, again leaving them loose each time. This kept the shelves from catching on the screws and getting hurt, and the whole thing is nice and sturdy when complete. Hope this helps someone.That said, the end result is a great space-saving feature in the corner of a tight closet for me. The open-cornered design keeps it from blocking access to other shelves nearby and it turned a messy pile of shoes on my floor to a neat easy-access display. Just what I needed.",
