It fit perfectly in my entry closet and had enough pieces to make a small set in the entry way.I like that it has an extra rack for purses, backpacks, etc.Some of the ends on the black pieces were really sharp and i had to pay attention because i sliced my finger while putting one in. I hope they pay closer attention to that but it\u2019s my only complaint.",

It is mainly for 2 pairs of shoes per slot but you can fit 3 pairs if you place them like I did as shown in the pictures. I'm a size 7 1/2 in women and my husband uses a size 13. Of course if the shoes are smaller I'm sure you could fit more.",
