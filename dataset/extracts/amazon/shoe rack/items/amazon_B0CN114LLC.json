This is not just a good storage idea for shoes. I also store shoe inserts and callous and corn pads which do not fall out.I also made them one long line and it felt nice and durable but a bit wobbly. When I made it in two I felt a huge difference in the sturdiness. It's compact and just what I needed for the small space where I wanted it. Improvements that can be made: make a version that has a bit more space for work boots.I like how I have the option to make it as tall as I want so it can fit many different places and needs.Arrived on time, all parts were present, it was super easy to assemble, however, the actual product is smaller than what the pictures display.This is the best product for its price point and will repurchase.Very high qualityVery impressed",

It's not meant for someone with arthritis in their hands to put this together and although it is easy to move around, once assembled, it is easy to tip over.This was a nice addition to my laundry room for my husband's shoes when he comes in from outside. Might need to purchase another one but I will have him put it together.",

When you want to move the entire rack, it is complex because it moves from one side to the other. very expensive considering that it does not have good stability and firmness",
