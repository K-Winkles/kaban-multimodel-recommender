                "reviewText": "Simple to put together though it\u2019s somewhat difficult to get the pieces all the way in. I was able to set it up exactly how I needed it to fit my closet and now my closet organization game is so much stronger. Unfortunately my closet is barely too small to use the front covers but when I tried them out they seemed to work really well and had a nice feel when the kinda \u201csnapped\u201d open or closed. I only wish I could give one of my covers to the person that left a review that was missing one! All of the pieces were accounted for in my set.Quality is excellent and I\u2019m not concerned about it falling apart or getting sad and stretched out like some of the fabric shoe shelves. For the price I\u2019m really happy with it!I was able to maximize the number of shoes this held a few ways so that each shelf holds 2-6 pairs of shoes:- For smaller shoes I stack them on top of one another with one facing in and one facing out so the taller parts of the shoes compliment each other and they use the available space efficiently. That allowed me to easily fit 4 pairs of women\u2019s shoes on some. I even double stacked some sandals.- For larger shoes like low top men\u2019s shoes you can alternate upright and upside down next to one another vs on top of one another (the height of the shelves are just a little short for that) but this will allow you to fit two pairs of larger shoes on one shelf- Alternating shoes with the right one facing out and left one facing in will also provide more space per shelf for wider shoes.All in all a great buy, I asked my partner how much he thought I paid for it and he guessed $100 so it looks more expensive than it is! I got a larger one than i thought i need so I\u2019d have flexibility with the parts and it worked perfectly. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I am glad that I went with these organizers rather than the individual boxes which may look great but are constricting. I have large feet (W12) and a variety of heels and boots. This allowed me to arrange them all. The boxes/cubes are a good size, but head\u2019s up \u2014 a divided box cannot hold heels and an undivided box cannot hold boots. This wasn\u2019t a big deal for me as I was able to arrange them with double boxes for boots and single for heels. Another drawback would be you\u2019ll fit less shoes than advertised: two sets hold roughly 45 pairs of flats, heels, and boots. Set up was really quite easy \u2014 did two cases alone without trouble in about 90-120 minutes. Proper sturdy enough to hold heavy boots. Definitely happy with the purchase and am glad it will be fairly simple to add on as I get more!",

All the reviews said it was simple to build. Well I didn\u2019t find it simple. The clips R a nightmare!!! You need to try to spread them out a little and push hard to get them on. I don\u2019t have the strength to do this part!! Also, the video on how to assemble is next to worthless. It shows nothing up close. That guy just speed demons through the whole video. Hence I rate it a 3",

                "reviewText": "If you notice, all the reviews with pictures have sneakers, no high-heels. The image used to advertise this product is very misleading with the picture of high heels on the shoe rack. With the divider in the cube there is no way a high heel will fit. You would have to remove the divider, leaving you with enough room to store 16 pairs or lay your heels on their side. Still only storing 16 pairs. After noticing my shoes didn't fit I looked up the standard dimensions for shoe racks. As a general rule, the shoe rack depth should be at least 13 inches so that it can store most types of shoes, including boots and stilettos. I will try to add a video or picture for a visual.",
