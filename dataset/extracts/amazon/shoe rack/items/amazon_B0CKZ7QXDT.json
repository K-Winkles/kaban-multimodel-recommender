                "reviewText": "The White Bamboo Shoe Rack for Small Spaces turns out to be a nice-looking shoe rack once assembled. By the way, there are no instructions included, but assembly is fairly straight-forward.The rack is light-weight, snap-together wood, but sturdier than other items of this type that I've had in the past. The base sits flat on the floor, so maybe that helps keep it from being wobbly. I'm quite happy with it.It's not the easiest thing to put together, but with perseverance you'll get it done. A couple suggestions:1. Photo #2 shows one of the slots with a solid piece that snaps into the hole. There are only four of these, so keep an eye out for them and use them on the same tier. That's important because the end of the other pieces all look like photo #3, with two \"pegs\" on one end and one \"peg\" on the other so they snap together.2. Don't be afraid of breaking it by pushing really hard. I also found that if you sort of angle the pieces in long ways as you try to force them into the slots it helps.This one was more difficult to put together than one I bought that was a natural finish, rather than painted. And there was a spot (that you can see in the 2nd photo) where the finish was scraped off. I added a little white paint and you can't even tell.Be patient and use some gentle force, and you'll have a lovely rack ready to use.",
