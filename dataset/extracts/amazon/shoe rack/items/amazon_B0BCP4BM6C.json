                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive and works well",
                "reviewText": "This is what looks like a black, aluminum frame with a polyester-like fabric as the base where the shoes sit (the product page says it is stainless steel, but I don't know about that!). The reality is that this is a low-cost product that will serve its purpose but isn't the best quality, which is fine, because the main goal here is to fit as many pairs of shoes as I can onto it.The organizer is over 5 feet tall and has 10 shelves that will hold about 30 pairs of shoes. I've had no issues fitting that many pairs of shoes in it, and even more because I tend to stack my flat sandals and flip flops, which then allows me to fit more shoes onto each shelf. The organizer feels sturdy, but it can easily wobble as well, so it is important to keep it in a place where you're either attaching it to the wall, or where there isn't traffic (like in a closet).There are three things that need to be mentioned and, I feel, speaks to the quality issue I mentioned before:1. If you look at the pictures, you will notice that the frame is wider than the polyester shelf where the shoes are placed. This can be an issue, especially if you were wide shoes, because the shoes do sometimes fall off through the space between the frame and the polyester shelf. If the manufacturer made the shelves a bit wider, that would stop being an issue. This is the biggest flaw of the entire design.2. The feet of the shelf is made of the same teejoints used on each shelf level (the corner joint that links the shelves to the rest of the organizer) and that's it. The organizer did not come with non slip caps or something to put between the metal and the floor. This is another reason it is good to have this in a place with little to no traffic because movement of the organizer can result in scratched floors3. The only way to fit any boots is to remove an entire shelf (or more). Otherwise, there is not way to fit any boots in there, taking away a lot of shoe storage room to store up to 3 pairs of bootsI am using it and it is holding up, but, improvements could be made, if anything so the shoes don't fall of and the floor doesn't get scratched",

                "reviewText": "We ordered this shoe rack not to accommodate shoes, but rather to be used to stack and store T-shirts, hats, and other clothing.Upon opening the box, I laughed when I saw how many pieces there were. I thought there was no way this would be a quick and easy project. Well, I was wrong. It was very easy and did not take nearly as long as I had anticipated.The hardest part, for me, was sliding the poles into the fabric sleeves. The sleeves you slide the poles in are barely bigger than the pole, so it is a tight fit. Also, it was helpful to me to separate the poles by size to avoid any confusion as you are assembling the rack.As you insert the vertical poles, I would suggest using a rubber mallet to gently tap the poles all the way down in order to keep the rack level as you go.Once complete I was able to move it to my closet without any effort as it is so lightweight. I was able to put 2-3 T-shirts on each shelf and still have room left over for more.I am very pleased with this rack and will be looking to get another shortly. I would recommend this to anyone looking to maximize their closet space.Title of the item I am reviewing:LFGUD 10 Tiers Shoe Rack, Simple Houseware 10-Tier Shoe Rack Storage Organizer 30-Pair, Eas",

                "reviewText": "This LFGUD 10 Tiers Shoe Rack set is super versatile and convenient.Not just for shoes...It's all in how you use it.Is it overwhelming to see all the pieces upon opening? Well...ya. But you kinda knew that when you ordered, right?I have cube shelving that is very similar to these shelves and they are amazingly strong.The only thing that I would change would be for them to include a plastic or rubber mallet for building.Luckily, I have one from my cube shelves. Definitely you will want something smooth and solid to get a strong connection.I've included pics to show the process that may help. But once you get started, it's easy.You'll start to think of places and ways to use them separately.The shortest poles are the 'legs'. Be sure to put the legs into the smooth side of the fittings.It helps to insert the legs first. Then the cross pieces to the legs. Then connect to the long poles. Don't forget to put the seam side down. Tap gently, but firmly for each connection, then again when assembled.I have one near the front door with 4 shelves. I placed a couple of shoe trays on the bottom shelf for my work shoes. That leaves the center ones for placing less used ones or something else.The top is perfect! I can place my work binder on one side and any other things that need to leave with me.The key is to place the objects so that they cover from one rail to the opposite rail. Very strong this way. You don't have all the weight resting on the 'shelf'.The shelves are actually made of thick cloth and are kept in place with plastic pipes and connectors.I have another single shelf at another door to catch my flops and a towel.Another single shelf at another door for the same purpose.Use your imagination and be creative.",
