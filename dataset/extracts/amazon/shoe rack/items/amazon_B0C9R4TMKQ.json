You can get creative with it if you don\u2019t need as much shoe space and fit boots in it by taking out one of the shelves. Also, heels might not be the best for this rack as they won\u2019t sit properly unless you plan on putting them in a shoe box, then it works!

                "reviewText": "I don't normally write reviews. In fact, the very few reviews I recall giving were for some incentive or perk for me in the end. So this is a rare incident that I take time from my busy day to let others know my thoughts on a particular product.I just finished putting this shoe rack together and I have to say, I'm impressed. I've purchased 4 or 5 different shoe racks over the years and this is by-far the best quality rack I've gotten yet. Especially for the price! Super easy to put together and even came with a wooden hammer to help speed up the assembly and make it a really solid unit. It's surprisingly sturdy and really light weight. I'm very pleased with this purchase and am more than happy to take the time and effort to leave feedback (on my own accord). You could say I'm using the time I saved from putting it together so quickly. Good purchase!",
