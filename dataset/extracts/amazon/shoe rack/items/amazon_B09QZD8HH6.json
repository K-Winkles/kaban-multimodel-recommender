Works great, three levels and flip flops fit under the bottom level if you choose that option.You can actually choose two different locations for both the bottom and top level to give a little more or less space, which is how you can store flip flops under the bottom level.It is not easy to put together by yourself. Since the shelf is fabric and has to be put on before the rods are attached, it becomes difficult. The fabric becomes very tight when you're done, but getting there is the hard part. Once you have one rod screwed in, the second has to be pulled out to line up the screw. Just a little difficult to do by yourself. I assume a third and fourth hand would make it a lot easier. I got it done though.In the end, cheap option for shoe storage in a closet.",

                "reviewText": "It looked complicated to assemble at first, but after studying all the pieces it was not bad. The only hard part was lining up the last screw of each canvas shelf to the post, you really had to pull hard on the canvas to get it lined up in order to center the screw. Although it is lightweight and has canvas shelves, it should be sturdy enough for just holding shoes, can be easily carried and moved.I have it in my entryway to catch all the various every day outdoor shoes, sandals, and crocs which got kicked around on the floor. Looks so much tidier, and is easier to sweep or vacuum around than shoes on the floor.",

It is also modular and you can expand it vertically if needed.Takes about 5 minutes to assemble if you have an electric screw driver/drill. Perhaps 10 minutes otherwise.Great build quality and comes with a couple extra screws just in case you lose one of them.Very well made. Am about to buy another right now.",

                "reviewText": "I just received the shoe rack today and it fits perfectly in my closet space without taking up a lot of room and I can now have my shoes in one place. I like that if I want to add on to either the top or sideways I can by purchasing another rack. I purchased the black rack and I really like the cloth shelves...they are very sturdy and look nice. They do not sag when shoes are placed on top of them.A couple tips for assembly, since I made a few mistakes and had to take it apart. There are only pictures for instructions and they do not show anything. First, when you snap the end pieces together, make sure the indented sides for the screw heads to fit in are facing out on both end pieces. When assembling, I put all the screws on one side first for the three tiers and tightened them. However, do not tighten them completely until you attach the other side because you will not be able to reach the screws in the holes on the other side unless there is a little looseness on the other end. After all the screws are loosely attached then tighten them all. Although the directions do not show this you will need a Phillips screwdriver to tighten the screws completely; I tried at first to tighten by hand and could not do it.",
