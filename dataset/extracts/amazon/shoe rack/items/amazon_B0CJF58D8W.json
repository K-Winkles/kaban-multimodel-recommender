                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve enclosed two photos.One is of the product \u201cunder construction,\u201d so you can see what you\u2019re getting yourself into. This thing comes with 126 separate pieces and if you\u2019re somewhat visuospatially challenged like me, I\u2019d set aside a good 90 minutes to get it fully assembled. (It\u2019s really not complicated and you don\u2019t even need any tools, but you do need to make sure that all the plastic connectors are facing the right way and that all the metal rods are securely inserted.)The other photo is of the fully assembled rack\u2014 as you can see, I\u2019m using it for organizing my clean laundry. For scale, I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and the rack is taller than me by 2-3 inches. It\u2019s so tall that if you wanted to, you could break this apart into two 5-tier racks (or any other configuration).The \u201cshelves\u201d are not made of metal or plastic. They are instead made out of a tightly woven synthetic fabric with a papery feel. (If you lived through the \u201880s and remember the \u201cpaper jacket\u201d trend, that\u2019s what this reminds me of. Those jackets were stronger than they looked!)In other words, these are not hard, solid shelves. They are flexible and thin, but still easily able to support several pairs of shoes, stuffed toys, or piles of clothing. However I would not recommend storing books or heavy equipment on them.Overall, for $36 I am happy with this purchase and I love how lightweight the rack is! You can very easily carry it from one room to another, which is a nice bonus.",

                "reviewText": "Luckily I didn't listen to the bad reviews. A few mentioned it was flimsy or came apart. I can tell you this is 100% avoidable with proper assembly. Key tool: rubber mallet!! Make sure to use the mallet to push all pp connectors fully into all metal rods. Very, very sturdy. I installed it in my garage so my kids can leave their shoes before entering the house from school and sports. My husband and son both wear size 11 and you can fit 4 pairs of mens shoes in one tier. My only hesitation was I wasn't sold on fabric tiers but it's actually a light weight yet strong shelving option. Only time will tell how it holds up. Another bad review mentioned it was missing a pp connector and they returned it. When I first assembled all the pp connectors (before stacking them up) I thought the same thing but I did the math wrong and they were actually spares! So don't jump to conclusions until you have it all together. I included a photo of the spares. I also anchored it to the wall to avoid any accidental fall if the kids are rough playing in the garage since it is lightweight so it definitely adds to the sturdiness. I'm a busy 5ft mom and it took me about 25min, so anyone can do it! Not difficult, just tedious. Hope this helps!",

Not good for a household with small restless children because it can easy fall off when pushed. Overall it's manageable and cheap stuff.",

                "reviewText": "When I opened up this box I told my wife that it was a thousand piece Erector Set puzzle. And if you can put yourself into the kiddie mentality and approach it that way it is easy to put together.I read a lot of reviews about how flimsy it was and how it would fall apart. Well people...HAVENT ANY OF YOU EVER HEARED ABOUT J.B. WELD CLEAR EPOXY?Here is how I put it together. Feed the: \"A\" rods through the shelves. Then epoxy the plastic corners onto the ends of the \"B\" rods. Make sure to keep the 'hole\" side facing in the same direction. Put a small amount of glue onto the ends of the rods and not into the plastic parts. A little bit goes al long way. To make sure that they all are straight and square, place the rods onto a flat tabletop and move the ends around until the rod no loner rocks on the flat surface at either end and it will be straight and square. Let the glue dry for about 3 hours before proceeding to the next part.Next glue Glue the \"B\" rods to the A rods. To make sure that is flat and square, put the shelf onto the tabletop and work with it until all four feet sit onto the tabletop without rocking. Wait for glue to dry. Next glue the \"c rod onto the upper \"holes\" of each shelf. DO NOT GLUES THE SHELVES TOGETHER AT THIS TIME. Let the glue dry. And then finally glue the shelves together. Remember the top shelf does not have any \"C\" rods in it. But the most important part of it all is to make sure that when you glue the ends on the \"B\" rods that all of the \"Holes\" face up in the same direction at each end of the rod.Yeah, it took longer to put together this way but I now have a set of really solid shelves that will not fall apart.PS.Make sure you push the rod all the way into the plastic corner, otherwise it wont turn out square.J.B.

                "reviewText": "I chose this shoe rack for its slim depth and its height. Vertical storage to save floor space in the walk-thru closet. I didn't realize the shelf material was fabric, but that's just fine. It goes on taught, no sagging / so far. Assembly was obvious from a once-over the illustrations. It's taller than I needed so I just left off 1 layer: it doesn't make any difference in it holding together. Keeping the parts in case of more shoes. It's light weight but that's just fine if you're not bumping into it. As long as the pieces & layers are squared off as you go, it stands just fine. The shelf height is fairly small so booties did not always fit standing up - ok, I just put them on their sides. Enough room that a couple pairs fit still in their boxes.",
