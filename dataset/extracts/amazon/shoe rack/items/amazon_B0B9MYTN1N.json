We have it inside our coat closet, so aren't worried about the top being in 2 pieces with a seam down the middle. If we were going to have it out in the open that may have been an issue because it doesn't look as good as just 1 piece across the top would. Easy to put together and very sturdy so far, it has gotten lots of use and doesn't wobble at all.",
