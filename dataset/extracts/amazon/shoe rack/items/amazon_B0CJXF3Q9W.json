Though, as some others have noted, this is not really a sturdy or heavy duty set of shelves. We kinda liked the K shape brackets as that is the first letter of my daughters middle name, but they are also kinda the source of rickety rockety action on this thing. You simply snap those outward to lock them in place. But they kinda easily pop back out, as do the x brackets in the back. Not sure this thing can really hold heavy items or take much pushing and pulling. So would be a bit wary of how you plan to use this.it seems easy about to separate this into 2 distinct pieces to mitigate the potential twistiness and instability ... so yeah, for 20 bucks hard to detract too much, but sure there are better options out there if you need something that can hold more weight or take a bit of a licking on the daily.",

Literally you just pull it upwards and it expands into its full size at which point you just stiffen out the sides until you hear a satisfying \u201cclick\u201d and your good to go.~ The generous amount of space that it creates for all kinds of things. It easily fits a pair of men\u2019s basketball shoes with room to spare.~ The minimal floor space it takes up is epic if your limited on space.~ When not in use it folds up so small and lightweight it can easily be stored almost anywhere.~ It\u2019s toddler proof!~ It\u2019s worth mentioning the conversation value as most people have not seen anything like it before.~ It\u2019s also aesthetically pleasing and not tacky or bulky at all.~ It is surprisingly strong and handles everything I have put on it with ease. It actually seems to get sturdier the more stuff i put on it as the items weighs it down a bit.~ lastly, it is quite affordableCons~ It\u2019s a little wobbly, it likes to sway a bit, but if you place it against a wall or ideally in a corner you won\u2019t have any problems.~ It\u2019s Plastic. Just personally not a huge fan of plastic.Overall, I adore this gem of a find and encourage anyone on the fence to try it out.This would be a great gift for a college student or anyone with a small living arrangement.I could see myself getting another one (or two!) for other areas of my apartment.",

                "reviewText": "If you are limited on space, this shoe rack is perfect. I live in a very old house (built 1845) and the rooms are very small and little to zero closet space, so in my situation the real estate on the floor is very valuable. This compact shoe rack can slide in the small unused space, and you are able to get 6 pairs of shoes on them \u2026 or 12 if you are like me.Literally no assembly is required... just lift the top shelf and simple snap the supporting legs into place, THAT IS IT! This is perfect!",
