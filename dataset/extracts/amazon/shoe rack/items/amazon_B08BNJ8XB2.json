                "reviewText": "I bought this in a pinch after not being able to find a rack locally. The cost is cheap but the quality is good. It fits my small closet with space on the side to allow for hanging longer garments, i.e. coats or dresses. The height allows for 4 levels of show storage (I keep my flat shoes on the top) with plenty of clearance for pants, skirts, and tops. I can fit 4 pairs of shoes on each level. This I did not expect, since I have some clunky shoes. I also like the mesh material better than slats. Easy instructions. Easy to assemble. Fast shipping. Recommend.",

It also tucks away nicely (even the larger 3 tier organizer) under your pre-existing wardrobe situation.I've owned other shoe rack organizers in the past (both on the floor and door hanging style) and this far surpasses the others. It is just the right size.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought the 3-tier shoe rack, not realizing how much room Crocs take up (they are, unfortunately, the only kind of shoe I can comfortably wear these days), so I made the 3-tier into a rack for folded clothes, for which it works perfectly. I then purchased the 5-tier, and now all my Crocs have a home. Two pairs of taller shoes are on the floor, with the toes nudged under the bottom tier. It's like they take up no room at all. Winner!I initially thought about getting an all-metal or wooden shoe rack, but upon thinking about it... why? The fabric is thick, and works very well for keeping shoes from sliding, and the metal is perfectly sturdy even though it doesn't weigh a ton. It's insanely easy to put together (ehhh, so you may have to fight with a screw that's hard to line up without a bit of muscle), and the only tool you'll need to provide is a medium-sized phillips screwdriver; something that should be in everyone's home toolbox anyway. Extra screws were provided.Tip for those with bad knees, hips, or backs: alas, I'm not as young as I used to be and have trouble moving around on the floor to assemble things, so I put the shoe-rack together on top of a twin-sized bed. Worked perfectly, and it weighs next-to-nothing, so you can flip it and turn it to get at the screw you need.How many bells and whistles do you need for a shoe rack, anyway? This one is basic, it's simple, and it works.",
