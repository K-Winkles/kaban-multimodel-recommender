The supports are supposed to have little tabs at the top and bottom of each ask to hold them in place, but after putting one pair of shoes in each level, the bottom supports cracked and broke. This may be a good solution if you\u2019re looking to only store flip-flops but if you try to store heels or normal shoes on the rack, they are too heavy for the supports to manage. I attempted to contact Amazon for a refund or replacement, but in order for that to happen, I would have to disassemble it take out the shoes that are still in it and reassemble. This was purchased to save time and space, and had the opposite effect.",

                "reviewText": "I'd give this product 3 stars. Overall, sure, it does the job, but there's a few things that could be better.For one, the side pieces break quite easily. I put them on backwards on my first go and so I had to take them out to put them in correctly. While taking them out, the parts that keep them in place broke off in the hole. That happened to three pieces even when I was being careful with the second two. Now it's a bit wobbly and I'm not sure if it's from those pieces snapping, or if it would've been wobbly regardless.Secondly, it BARELY fits men sized shoes. You really have to squeeze them in there, which makes me worried I'm gonna snap other pieces when I inevitably have to take those shoes out. And honestly, it barely even fits a woman size 9 1/2 shoe (top white shoe).. The middle, black shoe is a woman 8 1/2 and that fits the best out of all the pairs.I wouldn't buy this product again, or reccomend it, even though I think the coloring is cute. I don't think it'll hold up for very long.",
