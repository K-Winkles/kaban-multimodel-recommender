It didn't last long because there were no screws holding it together, instead it was the push and insert connection.This rack is well made. I like that it came with screws which makes the finished product sturdy. It was easy to put together but I wish instructions would come with words and not just pictures.I use this rack in the area as we come in from the garage. It has plenty of space for shoes and ankle boots plus it has a shelf at the top. I highly recommend this shoe rack.",

The wall stability attachment is also handy to keep it sturdy enough. This unit is a simple, unadorned, working shelving unit. Cons If at least one shelf was a bit taller, we could put high tops on it standing up-as it is we can still put 2 pairs boots on a shelf slanted a bit. We set it on top of a small absorbable rug so winter shoes can drip a bit on the bottom shelf. We do recommend it.",

The thing that attracted me was the modern look, the dark brown and black, looks amazing, in the pictures and in person. It was very easy to assemble, just a few screws and a screwdriver oughta do the trick (even a kid could set it up). One thing though, it is NOT a bench, it is only for putting items on it, like a purse, a shoebox, some mail, etc. If you sit on it, it will break, like what happened to me (I fixed it though). It holds a decent amount of shoes, and I like the small and short size, which makes it fit anything and anywhere. It is great for holding shoes, slippers, and shoeboxes. Overall this was a great purchase and I highly recommend to someone who does not need a bench shoerack and who lives in a small space.",
