The Walmart shoe rack had slanted shelves so our shoes kept falling off the rack. Got this one, and it\u2019s super easy to build. Just snaps together. However it\u2019s made of hollowed, very thin metal. If you put any pressure on it I\u2019d imagine it would snap. It fit perfectly in our closet. I mean it\u2019s only $20, so, I wasn\u2019t expecting master craftsmanship. Good enough to do the job, easy to build, just removed a star for quality/durability.",

It\u2019s also not great if all of your shoes are tall, as the lower levels aren\u2019t very roomy. For reference the men\u2019s shoes in the picture are a 14 and the women\u2019s are an 8.",
