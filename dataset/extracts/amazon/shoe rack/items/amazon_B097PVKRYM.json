                "reviewText": "At first I was dismayed when I opened the package because the plastic is so flimsy. I thought there is no way you can stack shoes with this. But, once you get the ends on and connect them, they are pretty sturdy. You can't stack a lot of weight on top but it will hold some stuff. I had all my shoes in clear boxes but getting to the bottom of the stack was a problem. I'd have to take everything down. Now, I just open the little door and grab my shoes. It really got my closet organized. I ordered the XLarge and it fits heels, tennis shoes, and some boots. Putting it together took some time to figure out. The ends appear not to fit but they do snap on if you get them just right. Once you get the hang of it, you can set them up pretty quickly. I will order another set, they work well for me.",

                "reviewText": "First, look at the price. The picture you see is fully assembled and of course it makes it look nicer than it actually is. You are not going to get 12 high end solid already assembled rigid plastic storage bins with easy open fronts. Also, these do not slide out.These are mass produced sheets of strong plastic that come completely flat made to expand into a shape of a box. So these are flexible and only rigid once the ends are assembled. Assembly is required and requires a bit of patience on the first one.In saying that, shoes should not require a strong storage box and these work fine unless you plan to use it every day all the time. I would recommend for storage & not for repeated use by many people. For shoes being used daily, I'd recommend something else or just use a regular shoe rack.Many styles of shoes will stand up straight in the box, but high heels may have to be turned sideways. I have also used for baseball caps as well.Assembly. It is very SIMPLE but patience is required! Expand the plastic sheets and make it form a box shape. Bend inward all tabs on both ends. Position the back onto one end and click in one side, then use your hands to guide the edges into the back, click in sides. Repeat for other end, paying attention to which way you want the little door to open. First few were slow, then it was easy from there on out.You have 12 to do so you might want to do a few of the same movements at the same time, or get someone to help.These will stack. You must push out the stacking tabs. The box on top has tabs on the bottom to slide into the top sides of box below to make it sturdy.Is this high end? No. Use care when opening the little door.Does it work well in the top of a closet? Yes. It took a lot of clutter and organized it very well, off the floor and into spaces we were not using.We bought another set for out closet so for what it is, we recommend it.",

They make the bottom of my closet look so nice and keep my shoes from getting dusty and unorganized. The height is a little short for high heels so I put them sideways which is not a problem at all. In some boxes I even have a couple pairs of sandals/flip flops/sneakers as they're pretty spacious. RECOMMEND THIS 10/10. You won't regret.",
