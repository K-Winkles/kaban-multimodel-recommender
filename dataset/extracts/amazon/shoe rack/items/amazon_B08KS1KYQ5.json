If the panel is not well aligned at the beginning, you can slightly move it to make it flat. We changed the hole of the joint between the feet and the panel to be large outside and small inside. The advantage of this is that the screws will not be crooked, making the four feet consistent with the ground.",

It is easy to put together with the instructions and tools provided. It really brings together my living room in a cute way and makes my shoes look more organized. It is also a life-saver with snow. I have it by my front door, ready to put all my wet shoes away. However, do be aware that if you only buy the two-shelf rack, there are little spikes at the top where other shelves can attack making it look a little interesting. You wouldn't notice it unless you looked closely but that is something to be aware of.",

It's simple to assemble, although allen wrench that came with it did not work well, and we had to use our own more substantial one. The rack doesn't not sit flush on the floor (rocks slightly) so had to use a felt adhesive to even it out. May settle with weigh on it. THe slatted racks are hinged for shipping but look okay once laid flat. However the rack is a bit shallow and short for adult shoes, unless you move it out from wall and are only putting flats or sandals on the middle and lower shelf. The bamboo wood feesl flimsy. Had I been selecting for her I would have gone with a metal rack with higher clearance and deeper shelves.",
