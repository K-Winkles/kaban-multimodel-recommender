My apartment walk in has zero shoe storage and I have a lot of shoes. I needed a solution with a combination of capacity, maximum height (to fit under my shirts), and maximum length. Two of these are perfect. I can use the wood top shelf for shoes too, the top wire shelf allows enough room for my boots, and the bottom shelf leaves enough room for all my flip flops under it on the carpet. Hoobro has a similar but lower cost 4 tier but it didn\u2019t have enough room for the flip flops. I paid a fair amount more for this one because of that. This product was really easy to assemble and it looks great. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Great shoe shelf. I was worried there wouldn't be room for the doc martins but they fit on the first rack perfectly! If you have taller boots you can just remove one of the racks to fit them in. There's also enough room underneath for another row of shoes or sandals. We're able to fit 3 pairs on each rack and they're not crowded at all.The grates might get mucky with mud and snow in the wetter months but you can just put a tray in otherwise a drippy mess is unavoidable as this shelf does not defy the laws of gravity.My only (very) minor gripe is the upward lip at the back of each rack, if you have larger than size 10ish mens shoes/boots then they'll stick over the front edge a bit but you can slant them slightly if that bugs you. The racks can be installed to tilt down so the lip is needed to stop your shoes from sliding off...again with those pesky laws of gravity.Love that it has the shelf on top for baskets and such. This is exactly what we were looking for and the price was worth it compared to what you get elsewhere for a similar price. I'd recommend this for keeping your mudroom or entry way clutter free.",
