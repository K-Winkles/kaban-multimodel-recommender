It's also surprisingly sturdy, especially for something is held together without glue or hardware.The assembly instructions are not written the best, but it was easy to figure out. You'll need to be firm and even when pressing the pieces together. Knocking down one star because the dimensions in the description are not accurate (although it actually did turn out to be roomy enough to accommodate a pair of running shoes) and because it wants to lean a little (not enough to make me worry, but I might anchor it to the wall).",

                "reviewText": "It was easy enough to assemble though the parts I already assembled kept coming apart as I assembled the additional shelves. I thought the weight of shoes on the shelves would make it sturdier but it did not. Pieces came apart within a few days as I placed or removed shoes from the shelves.After 2 weeks, I took it apart and reassembled it with wood glue. It is now almost perfect. I say almost because I would be happier if it was just a tad bit wider. I have big feet - I wear a size 10 in Women's shoes and I have to place my shoes on the shelves one at a time otherwise if I hold the shoes in one hand and try to place them on the shelf together, they don't fit.Also, I cannot fit low-rise boots on the shelves so I can only store one pair at a time on the top shelf.It is VERY lightweight and not very sturdy so it should be placed somewhere it cannot easily be bumped into. I have it near my front door but it is positioned in way that it cannot be knocked over.",

I tried to see if there was a way for me to reach out to the seller to resolve this by getting a replacment part without having to take the whole thing apart but I do not see a way.PRO: Good for small items and child sized shoes. Feels flimsy till you put items on the racks then gravity does it's thing. Nice to not have to deal with tools and screws that can strip the wood.",

                "reviewText": "It's a great idea, poorly executed.As I assembled it, pressing the support pieces into the hole - each hole did split. Only one or two was simply \"firm\" otherwise extremely tight and of course the Bamboo, as it does, it split.If you have a mind to keep it as you put it together and are handy, simply apply some white-glue as you go. But - then, that's it and will remain.I liked the functional, changeable design - sadly, it would not survive a reconfiguration well, unless then glued. I considered hard-bar-soap to possibly ease my assembly then wondered - so proceeded.I got the 17 tier format. I see/saw I would wind up with left over pieces which confuses me - either a platform (need even numbers for tiers since it takes two to make one) - or, the support sticks (two packets leftover with how I configured this.It could otherwise be a 4-5 star recommendation, but sadly, not with how this was and I read the other reviews.I don't have the time to \"sand\" holes and etc. and expect to receive a product as describe and not damage itself as assembled - unless specified - \"expect cracks and splitting\" ? as you proceed and left over parts if purchase the uneven format. If it had 18 platform pieces I could have used the left over 8 support sticks - 4 to make that level and 4 to attache it.",

Women's size 9 shoes fit fine and you just have to put the men's size 10's in one at a time - both hang out a bit over the front. Anything much bigger might be a problem. Wish I could buy a smaller set to add a few more rows. They fit together really well and were pretty sturdy once in place. Technically you only get two top sections (it has a different style post so there's no hole). I needed 3 stacks so one has a gap in the top but it still functions well and you can't see it anyway.",
