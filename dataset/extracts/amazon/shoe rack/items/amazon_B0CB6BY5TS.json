In our last home we had an over the door shoe rack for our closet. Our new home all the doors are narrow. Seriously \u2014 the rooms, closets, even the cabinet doors are all narrow. It\u2019s a crime.So for the last 4.5 years we have been using that rack on a smaller scale anchored to the wall. But it wouldn\u2019t stay anchored and for some reason it never FELT organized even when our shoes were on it and it was fine. Last week I found this beauty. And lemme tell ya, it\u2019s a life saver.It was easy to install. No, seriously. You put the poles into the pole then snap. Rinse repeat. Add a few screws. Bam. It took maybe 10-15 minutes and I watched TV while I did it. It fit perfect in our little spot and the shoes feel so much more organized now.10/10 recommend as it\u2019s held up, is study, and has plenty of room for a hoard of shoes. Well worth the price.",

The price is good too.",

Everything was labeled & packed nicely . The instructions felt easy to understand & follow. I took a measuring tape and it's actually 41 inches long . Not 42. You'll get 42 inches if you start at the 1 inch when measuring. For me it holds about 18 pairs of shoes. & I still have space underneath. Which can probably store up to 4 more. My spouse wears about a size 9.5 & I wear a size 5. Across it can fit about 4 pairs of his shoes & 5 pairs of mine on my own row. I could probably fit up to 5 for his as well if I crammed it . But I don't like the look of the shoes being crammed. I still think this was a great purchased. I would definitely order this again if we need it. It looks great & feels sturdy.",
