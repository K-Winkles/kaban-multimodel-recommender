It is definitely a premium category product & I would highly recommend it if this design is your thing.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Shelf is very solid- Looks classy and elegant in the home with the box design- Feels very sturdy. Great build quality overall- Comes with instructions/directions leaflet in the package and assembly is super easy with snap-on parts- It is overall very stable & has no risk of falling at all- Very reasonably priced for this qualityCons:- It definitely has limitations with the shoe size. My jordans fitted barely on the shelf so I wish it was wider- It does wobbles since these are plastic boxes & not metallic solid built",

It stands on its own well and I don't have any fear of it tipping over. (That said, if you really tried, you probably could load it in a way that would tip it over, but you'd really have to be trying.)It took me a little bit to figure out the assembly. The instructions say to start left to right, and they mean it. If you go left to right and nestle the 1st corner into the groove, it goes together easily.I tried to reconfigure, and while you can pull it apart, I did break one of the pegs when I did so. Having 1 broken peg did not affect the sturdiness at all, though, because the cubby is well designed with plenty of support.",

I did have a pair of ankle boots that I had to turn on their side and only one shoe per cubby would fit, as seen on the lower left in the photo.

I do like how it looks and how easily it fits in my closet since you can maneuver it to stack how you want. I like this product but apparently you need strength to build it haha!",

                "reviewText": "This was a Wonderful purchase but I did have some comments/Concerns and observations that may help others. And I have tried to provide detailed photos showing issues and comparisons.1. I didn't find it easy to put together at first.. It was a bit of a challenge because it was a little difficult to get the side supports into the slots at first and it may help to have a extra pair of hands. I found myself getting one side in but then the other would fall before I could get the other side in and if I did get them to stay in it took some work to get them vertical (I felt I might break off the insert tabs). It felt a little bit like building a house of cards that kept falling apart. However, like others, once I was finally able to get the swing of it it did start to be easier but in my opinion it took a waaaay too long for something that should have been simple, at least for me.2. While it is lightweight (which is great) it doesn't feel real \"sturdy\". I needed it to be two wide and quite tall, so perhaps there is a way to improve that configuration and it may be more solid if you were configuring it to be wider. I would think if you had it the open it would be easy to knock it over or at least catch a corner and have it spill everything out or just fall over as a whole. (I needed it for inside a closet so this isn't a issue for my purpose but may be for others using it in an entry or hallway with foot traffic)3. I got two -8 tier in Black and configured them 2 across and 6 high4. Some of the photos in the listing, IMO, are misleading or downright Fantasy as there is NO way you could put a higher heel in the spaces and the shoes shown have GOT to be CHILD sized.The tallest you could put in there is a very low heel, tennis shoes or a flat sole high top (chucks). If you are looking for a solution for heels you will need to stick to a low/no heel or maybe put them on the sides ( I didn't attempt to try this so don't even know if that would work). I wear size 9-10 so I would imagine for men's sizes you would have more space limitations.5. It also seems that there are TWO completely different styles. I got the Black which are NOT the same as the ones shown in the Video (with all the color choices) or the blue ones which are TOTALLY different. Those look to better Quality/Materials/Construction and also seem to have the ability to make taller \"spaces\" . That was NOT possible with the pieces I received. *see photos6. I also feel that there was also VERY little actual \"swoop\" to prevent the \"slip off\" as shown in the phots. The ones I received seemed almost FLAT with hardly any \"swoop\" *again see photos.For all these things above I knocked them down to a 4 and honestly I feel it really should be a 3.5 star because of the kind of not so accurate representation in the examples givenSo BE AWARE of all these things before you Order..Now for the Good stuff...1. This was a Perfect Solution for a difficult space in a pre-existing closet set up until I can do a complete gut /remodel so that what a huge WIN-WIN!2. It was LITEREALLY a Perfect solution!3. For the overall price it was a great deal (I got mine on sale - $23.99) and purchased 2 - 8 tier but I am not sure if I would purchase them again at full price but for my situation and needs these Worked Great!4. Is really just a wish list that I hope the manufacture will take into consideration. It would have been nice to ACTUALLY have the choice to ordering the other \"style\" in the colors they showed in the videos. My only choice was the blue two-toned model which was NOT going to work or the \"lesser\" I guess \"cheaper\" version in Black. It would have been nice to have a choice between both styles in more basic colors. White or perhaps Grey.As I said Overall I am extremely happy and it completely fits the bill for what I needed. I hope that my photos can help others make an informed decision and I just wish the seller would have been more accurate and realistic with their photos.",

Bueno voy a intentar devolverlo por incompleto.",
