                "reviewText": "I really like the sturdiness of the material on this product. The only problem I ran into while assembling was 4 missing screw holes(D screws) on piece 5 in order to screw part E onto 5 to connect it to piece 7. On page 4, step 3 of the instructions the photo shows 2 holes on each side of the front of piece 5, but then page 5, step 5, shows 4 holes on each side of the front of piece 5. My solution was to forcefully make my own additional 4 screw holes, but I believe the \u201clid\u201d loses sturdiness for opening and closing by doing this. Other than this, I am impressed by this product!",

                "reviewText": "I have never left a review on Amazon, but after receiving and putting this item together I felt it important to warn others. This arrived in an Amazon box that was way oversized with no packaging so the outer box was smashed on the end. The product box was was also bent on each end from shipping. Luckily the inside of the product box did have foam which protected the pieces. The reason for this bad review is because the product is just painted particle board. Assembly / installing the screws worked fine, holes lined up fine. The instructions were okay there. This product also has those pieces where you have to screw in the rod and put in the round thing and twist to lock. This is where I think the parts suck. The rod screw caused the product to lose paint when installing those screws and the locking part are not made well and did not lock to the rod well/tight, making it very loose. Also the pieces were numbered with stickers which were hard to get off, pulled the paint and left glue where the stickers were. Had to make an extra effort to get all that off. So for 80.00 the quality is not up to par. I have put many items together like this and this was the worst for quality, instructions and parts. Don't waste your money.",
