I'm not putting excessively heavy shoes on them or anything, just regular sneakers like converse, nike, brooks, etc and flip flops (FYR: women's sizes 7 & 8 men's size 9). Unfortunately, since the poles that create the shelves do not stay in place it is effectively useless. Also the top 'shelf' is just flimsy, fragile, material that can't hold much weight at all. I have to buy a different one. I would recommend you do the same.",
