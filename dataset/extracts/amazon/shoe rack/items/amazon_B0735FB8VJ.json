We easily filled this thing with boots and shoes and flipflops and crocs and omg why do we have so many dang shoes in my house. It's very sturdy. The wheels make it great to move if we drop something behind it. The shelf size of each row is prefect for little kid or size 13 boots. Read the instructions on putting it together. It's very simple but you need to do it in order. I highly recommend this shoe self.",

                "reviewText": "I live in a very old house, with almost unusable, tiny dark closets. Did women not have clothes in the early 40s? Sharing with my husband means I can put about four pair of shoes there-on the floor.When my son moved out, I decided to turn his room into a closet. I also want him to come home now and then, so I keep it organized and attractive. The first thing I bought was this shoe rack, and it does that, and pretty well, I think. Of course, I love shoes so I never mind seeing them.I\u2019m old enough to have grown kids, and I put it together myself. Not a hard job at all. It rolled easily to where I wanted it, and then I locked the wheels and it hasn\u2019t budged.My shoe size is 6.5 and the shoes fit. One or two of my super high heels are a bit small for the rack, but with the heel over the bar they stay on. A piece of cardboard would fix it if they didn\u2019t balance properly, although I wouldn\u2019t use that fix for more than a couple shoes. Fortunately, I rarely wear 5 inch heels any longer so there is only one pair with that issue left.I love having them all organized and in place, and we have a lot fewer shoes lying around the house. Those over the door racks and circular revolving racks never worked for me, not to mention the hanging one shows the bottoms of the shoes so it\u2019s not attractive. This will also keep me from buying too many shoes, as I plan to limit myself to what can fit. (In the interests of honesty, I have two ikea pull down shoe cabinets but I keep slippers and flip flops in them.)My rack currently has 45 pairs of shoes and I can easily fit 50. In the old days I\u2019d have needed two, but now that I\u2019m not working I can get by. Count your shoes before you buy. I don\u2019t think you can double up easily and certainly not with heels. The spaces between racks are small so you\u2019d need very flat shoes to double.Heels, pretty as they are, just aren\u2019t a part of my lifestyle any more. Ease and comfort are, and walking into a room, seeing what I have, and grabbing a pair for the day is worth it. I\u2019d been rummaging through various places I kept them, and trying to remember if I had them and where they\u2019d be.., and this is so much easier. I\u2019ve had it since December, and I count this as one of my most useful purchases. You may too.So tell me, were 50 pairs of shoes really not something women had in the early 1940s? How primitive!",

I did not use the rolling castors that came with it but they are good quality so I saved them. This rack is quality compared to others I viewed, I\u2019m very pleased with my selection. My closet is 8\u2019x10\u2019 and it\u2019s like shopping in a boutique with the shoe rack. I have room for a second and I will want it so I will purchase while it\u2019s available. It\u2019s one of those things if you know you\u2019re going to want another one, you wait, and while you snooze you loose, out of stock or not available anymore. Live and learn. I\u2019m buying another. A fantastic value, solid, looks attractive for a shoe rack in a home closet. I say it\u2019s 5 STARS for me. (I have big feet)",

                "reviewText": "I really truly love this shoe rack. First, the price is incredible for the quality of the shoe rack. Second, it actually does hold 50 pairs of shoes (Women's shoes). Third, it is mobile. And lastly, it's pretty sturdy.Details: Shipped quickly via Amazon Prime. Box was undamaged upon arrival and packaging was adequate. Assembly was not too difficult, only took about 30 minutes. Some pieces required a little elbow grease to slide together. Fully assembled product is sturdy and mobile. This is key since I needed storage space for my shoes but the only open space in my room was in front of a seldom used exit door. Loading my shoes onto this rack, I realized that it is like any other rack of this style-- if you have high heels, the heel will encroach the space for the shoe on the rack below it. No big deal for me. Also, if you have anything higher than an ankle boot, you will need to put them on the top rack or on the floor below the bottom rack. Each rack has a coating that helps to prevent shoes from slipping off the rack. Each rack actually does hold 5 pairs of women's shoes. Even fully loaded with shoes, it is still easy to roll from one location to another. The wheels also have little locks on them to keep them in a stationary position. It is worth mentioning, if you have small children, there would certainly be a tipping hazard with this rack. Overall, this is a great value for shoe storage.",

                "reviewText": "This shoe rack is perfect! Easy to assemble. Sturdy construction. Fits lots of shoes. You can easily remove some of the bars to fit in taller boots if needed. Best part is that the rods the shoes sit on are metal and covered with a texture so the shoes won't slip off. I read reviews on shoe racks with plastic shelves that were dust magnets and fabric shelves that would sag over time and you can't easily clean them. I also like that it has castor wheels for easy moving. If you have bigger feet, I wouldnt say this will hold 50 pairs, but 40 for sure. This rack is perfect and at a fair price!",

                "reviewText": "The rack is self-assembly, the only tool needed is a Phillips screwdriver, although an electric screwdriver is a big help. Construction is straightforward - I found it easiest to lay out the 2 sides flat on a double bed, then pick each one up and attach the first rail. After that, adding the rest of the rails is easy, with the rack becoming more rigid as each rail is fitted into place with the final rigidity being achieved with the addition of the 2 rear cross braces.The 4 castors screw into place witb the aid of the supplied thin spanner, note that the 2 with the brake mechanism should go at the front.I won't, however, be using this as a shoe rack - I intend to fit shelves, and use it for an instrument rack.Overall, you get a lot of well engineered metal for your money and the rack is sturdy and versatile.",
