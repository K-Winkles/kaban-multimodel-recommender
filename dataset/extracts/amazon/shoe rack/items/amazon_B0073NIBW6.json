Admittedly, I did not have to assemble this - my 17-year-old niece did it for me. So I can't speak directly on the ease of assembly, but in my \"supervisory role\" it appeared to be a snap. :) And the finished product is great - definitely the best of three shoe racks I own. The height easily accommodates running shoes, which was my biggest concern. The width accommodates three across so nine in total, just about right. And it is actually attractive! I know, how can \"shoe rack\" and \"attractive\" go together?! But it's just a nice quality and much better look than metal or plastic. All in all, a nifty product that I can highly recommend.",

Went together easy and is sturdy. Looks nice and functions well. Some of the wood pieces are just a bit rough but you have to study it to really notice it. I am a stickler for details so I notice these things but the average person probably won't. Overall, am happy with it and would buy again if I need another.",

                "reviewText": "Simply built, simple to assemble. It holds 3 pairs of shoes on each level (size 11 shoe here) Boots have to go on the top rack due to clearance restrictions.Also, a feature I didn't see mentioned was that these are stackable. If you buy a 2nd one, the other will stack on top. Nice feature.I purchased a discounted version of this, due to the box being opened once upon a time or something to that effect. As reasonably expected, there were some issues with it, as it was definitely assembled by someone at one time and was broken (the bamboo was split by a long screw, or it was overloaded previously. Two screws were broken, and they did not appear to be defective. Other screws were bent. Since I was half expecting something like this, it was worth the discounted price tag for the few more minutes it took me to drill another adjacent hole (there was plenty of meat for a 2nd hole) and I inserted a smaller diameter screw. One of the broken screws I welded back together Red/Green style and it works wonderfully now. It seems that split bamboo is a common issue with these, but it is easily avoidable with a little mechanical assembly aptitude, along with ownership of a drill and drill bits. If the screws start going in hard, its time for a shorter screw or a bigger pilot hole.As far as craftsmanship, I think that they could easily be a bit more consistent in the drilling of their pilot holes, and this could have been the reason for that one part that I mentioned being broken. If it was not for that, it is a 5-star product. It looks nice, is sized efficiently, fit and finish was good.I recommend it for residential use, as I wouldn't expect it to hold up to heavy duty abuse of, say, your place of employment where people are constantly using something that is not theirs. Don't be using it to sit on while you put your shoes on. Its not made for that kind of duty.",

We keep one by the front door (we are a \"no shoe\" household) and I bought another to keep in my closet. The only improvement I would suggest would be to add a small rubber piece to the feet on the bottom, because the wooden pieces made scratches in the hardwood floor. I ended up putting small pieces of felt on the bottom, but I have to switch them out periodically because they attract dust and dirt.",

So far, it is very sturdy and it looks way better than that crappy thing I bought in the past with the metal tubes and plastic sides, (which fell apart every time I bumped it) The shoes sit on it nicely and don't fall through like the other kind. It's a bit tricky sometimes to get the last peg in when putting together, and I did shave a bit off the side of the peg that wouldn't go in, but other than that, not at all complicated to put together.",

                "reviewText": "This is a shoe rack, that could have been a lot more than what it. I had to return the first one I ordered as it was broken (see pictures). Amazon very quickly and without fuss sent me a new one (I need to return the broken one otherwise I'm charged for both). The second one I received was still broken but not to the extent the first one was and was still completely useable.It holds approx. 10-12 pairs of shoes depending on how big your shoes are. There is definitely no room on the second or third shelves for anything other than trainers/sandals. Boots/heels will need to go on the top shelf. It is very attractive and looks nice sitting by our back door in the living room. This is definitely ONLY a shoe rack. I've seen some questions asking if it can be sat on...ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! It is strong enough for shoes and that is it. My little boy loves it, he loves playing and rearranging all the shoes on it.The second one I received (see pictures) was assembled really quickly and easily - 6 screws with an allan key - done. the thing that was \"broken\" was some of the shoe supports had not been glued in properly and therefore have slightly bowed (see picture) this is a super easy fix with some glue and not worth returning as it is not noticeable and does not render the rack unusable.",
