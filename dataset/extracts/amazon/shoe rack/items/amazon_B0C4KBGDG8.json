                "reviewText": "The instructions that come with this are a little unclear. There are three different connectors to connect the three different metal pipes, and the connectors that have more than two pipes to connect need to have the longer opening pointing downward to assemble properly. Also, it's hard to push the pipes in correctly if you start connecting them at the shelf ends. It felt like one of my connectors got bent a bit when I was assembling one of the shelves starting with the end. You should start in the middle and then connect either side, then the ends. Also, pay attention to where the shelf fabric is supposed to go in the end, so that the seams can be kept on the underside of the shelf.I like that they included the little gloves, as many items are starting to, as they help protect your hands as you push pipes in and also keep the furniture clean during assembly. There is also a small mallet to help get everything pushed in properly for a good fit. Once put together, the shelf looks good and is fairly sturdy. A very good value. The dimensions listed are accurate, as I was able to fit this exactly where I needed based on the measurements. I have a nice little display for my sneakers now, I'm happy with it.",
