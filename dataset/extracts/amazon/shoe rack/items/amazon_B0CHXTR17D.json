I notice other reviewers say the shelves are the wrong length, that is because the diagram in the instructions are wrong. If you ignore the diagram and just build it to be square shelves joined by poles it comes together easily. I actually had the kids make it as a snowy day project and it went smoothly. The actual shelves are a polyester fabric so again, won't hold heavy boots but good for regular shoes.",

The \"shelves\" that hold the shoes is like a construction paper felt. Idk how long they will last and I'm not sure what to replace them with yet but for now hopefully it should last awhile before thats needed. \ud83d\ude05 It took about 25mins to put together.
