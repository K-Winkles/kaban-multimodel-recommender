                "reviewText": "Great Value- Easy Install. PERFECT fit in my foyer space. Fits 4 womens size 10 wide width shoes easily . I had my brothers size 10 mens sneaker on top and it was fine. I was a little skeptical at first because the price was a lot less than others I have seen. The slats come folded so the center part is hinged. You have to tighten the screws in securely, but once you do - it holds up fine. Its very lightweight and exactly what Ive been looking for. Didnt want anything super heavy or 'solid'. Its convenient, affordable and fit perfectly for my need.",
