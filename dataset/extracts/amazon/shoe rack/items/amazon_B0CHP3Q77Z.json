                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Moderately Simple Construction, Rigid Once Tight and Complete",
                "reviewText": "Like many of these inexpensive shelves/racks, the materials are all thin metals and plastics. This isn't necessarily a bad thing given it keeps the rack extremely lightweight and makes the construction fairly simple. All of the pieces simply insert or twist, there is no hardware. With that said they all fit together quite tight, and once all together result in a nice and rigid shoe rack. The included wooden mallet (while extremely cheaply made) is nice to have handy as the majority of the pieces do need to be \"tapped\" together with the mallet. I would recommend using the included mallet, as something heavy in your existing toolbox may break some of the plastic pieces whereas the wooden mallet applies just enough pressure to fit together without the risk of chipping or breaking anything.One small piece of advice, for the horizontal bars that create the surface of the shelving, they are two pieces that insert and then screw together. There are 20 horizontal bars to \"build\" for me, 90% when together very smooth and required nearly no \"elbow grease.\" Two did not. Easy fix: if they start to not come together smooth and begin to cross-thread, just swap the male and female ends with alternate pieces and they will go together likely without any hassle at all. No need to force them together, another pairing will work well.Ultimately, moderately simple construction, just enough force needed to get it to come together and the result is a rigid, inexpensive, and functional shoe rack.",

                "reviewText": "Where to begin with this shoe rack? First of all, it comes with a mallet that looks like it was carved by a medieval woodworker who time-traveled it forward to December of 2023 solely for me to pound in black plastic rods into holes of a shelf that will hold my family's plethora of shoes. The next thing you need to know that that it was actually pretty easy to assemble, so you actually won't even need the time-traveled wooden mallet. The instructions were simple. The shoes are ultimately going to sit on thin, cheap fabric that you pull horizonal rods through. This was unexpected, but actually fine because it made this shelf lightweight and easy to move around, in addition to holding more shoes than I ever imagined!Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive and lightweight shoe shelf, this product is something I would definitely recommend.",
