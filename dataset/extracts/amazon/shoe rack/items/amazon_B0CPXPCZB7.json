They ARE pulled taught, but the shelves are not the best for high heels. It can be managed, but I would have preferred a \"solid\" shelf. It was fairly easy to put together. I did it myself in under half an hour, but be prepared to use your feet, as well as your hands if you don't have help. It has those little nubby things that snap into a hole when you press them down (which always pinches my fingers), and at one point you have to push down 2 sides at once while holding the bars up. Not impossible, but awkward at best.I would not call this piece \"sturdy,\" which was one of the adjectives used in the description. The whole thing weighs like 1 lb. So easy to move, but definitely not solid & sturdy. I'll keep it because it's way too much trouble to take it apart now. It works, and for the money, I still think it was a good buy.",
