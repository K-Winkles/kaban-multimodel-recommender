It's inexpensive and it's fabric, not wood. But the pieces fit together very well. It fits into the little corner I had available for it, and it fits into a closet. I am able to put two pairs of shoes on each shelf. It's providing me with a perfectly usable shoe rack while I think about what I want in the log run.You could also use this for purses, winter accessories or to toss your keys and wallet on.I'd recommend it for situations when you aren't going to have a wooden rack: college, studio apartments, people who don't know what they'll want in the future.",
