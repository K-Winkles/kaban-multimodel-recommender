DID NOT FIND OUT TILL I WAS FINISHED MINUS THE TWO PIECES. FAST EXCHANGE, NO PROBLEM.It sets up easily but make sure you put the PVC connectors in the right position or you'll have to call Lorraine and ask her to postpone the tea party, text Bob -- he won't ever answer the phone -- and tell him to make it tomorrow..because you have to turn the gizmos around, then realize you did half wrong again, all while the 85-year-old lady you bought them for to be kind -- she's obsessed with shoes, keeps buying them at the thrift store, it's INSANE -- sits there and watches you and says, \"Uh, looks like you broke it. That one's cracked...\" and looks like you asked her to swim in a meat suit with sharks if you asked her to hold something.Nevertheless, if you lay it all out right, it is a snap to put together in about 5 minutes. The \"fabric\" style shelves are actually quite tight when you assemble it and it is as sturdy, strong, and versatile as it says!This could be used for many things other than shoes that are equally as light, no more weight than two pairs of shoes on each shelf. Could have towels, linens, clothing, hats, kitchen and bath paper -- not reams of real paper (too heavy), maybe a Cat Hostel....no, scratch that. But for the money, it is nice!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the 8-tier shelf. I was surprised at how cheap the material was, but I guess I shouldn't have been given the price. It was very easy and quick to assemble. It holds two pair of shoes on each tier, although it's a pretty tight fit for my boyfriend's big tennis shoes. Even though the material seemed cheap, it's working just fine. I've been using it for about 10 weeks with no issues and would say it's worth the money I paid.",

                "reviewText": "This is a simple pipe and elbow structure with synthetic fabric stretched between as decks. The pipes are lightweight metal and the elbows appear to be some sort of nylon. The construction takes a little bit of time and effort but everything fits together well. The pieces aren't heavy duty so some obvious care is needed. When the box arrived I was expecting lightweight but I was still surprised.In terms of utility I'm rating this one high. It's sturdy enough to hold a few pairs of boots up high and two pairs of shoes/sneakers on every deck below. They're sufficiently wide enough for full bodied shoes as well. I bought this one because its vertical and space is at a premium in my small apartment. This is not attractive enough for the foyer or mudroom. I'm thinking this is more of an inner closet or garage setup that is out of sight. But since I don't care about looks in my very utilitarian living situation, I'm not marking down for this.... considering one should understand where this would actually be used.If you need a shoe rack with a tiny floor footprint and lots of storage space, that you can easily move from place to place, get this one. If you have a bunch of high tops or boots, get something with more clearance. My midtop Merrells barely fit. My 8 inch combat boots only fit on top. Regular sneakers and shoes fit fine.",

It is compact and fits nicely in smaller spaces. It holds a decent amount of shoes (depending on type of shoe -- boots versus tennis shoes). For what I needed it for, it was a good purchase for the price. The plastic slots that hold the pole in place are cracking, but they are still holding it together.This can also be used for more than just shoes. I have small storage containers and some miscellaneous items I just needed out of they way, this was perfect for that. HIghly recommend if you are looking to just organize or store shoes.",
