                "reviewText": "This was a little challenging to assemble because several of the pieces are very similar in size. What helped me was to lay out all the tube pieces and sort them by length so I knew which piece was which. The shelves are made from a canvas like material and are not solid, but they will still hold your shoes well. There is a protect coating on the shelves so muddy or dirty areas can easily be wiped clean. This fit great in my coat closet to store my shoes on to keep the entryway uncluttered.",

                "reviewText": "The \u201cinstructions\u201d that came with it are more of this is how many parts you should have (no labels on the parts- I measured the rods so I knew which where which) and vague instructions. The connectors for the rods (both) are very cheaply made, the rods seem pretty sturdy and aren\u2019t plastic. I like the design of it, having three regular shelves and a (what looked to be deeper) basket shelf. Will see how long this lasts as one of each connector broke during assembly but I did get at least one extra.",

                "reviewText": "i waited a little while to review this (about a month) to see how it would hold up. one of the most important parts to a shoe rack like this are the connectors that hold it together and they are excellent as pics show. thick, not flimsy squishy plastic. and the rods are thin but not that cheap soft aluminum stuff that bends really easily. they're solid. ordered gray but it's black which i'm fine with. (lighting in 1 pic makes it look kinda blue-ish but its black - frame and shelf material) have way more shoes on it than 5 or 6 per shelf and it's holding up just beautifully! little basket shelf's a useful thing too. ordered 2 of these and had an issue w missing pieces, contacted seller who immediately helped resolve the problem so 5 stars for customer service!! no issues whatsoever w parts or anything else w 2nd order so i think the 1st time i might've gotten someone's return by amazon accident or something.",
