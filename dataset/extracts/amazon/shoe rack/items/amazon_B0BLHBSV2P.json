                "reviewText": "Easy to Assemble, 3 out of 5 Stars because...Yes, they are stupidly easy to assemble. But such a pain in the hiney! Make sure that your little connecting feet are all on the same side. The ends are not easy to take apart should you make a mistake. The plastic will break and make that one box unsturdy. Thankfully it can be placed in the center and be supported by other boxes.Sturdiness, give four out of five stars. The way these go together is genius. This concept is truly amazing. However, it's quite a pain if one is off-center. If one connector isn't right and you go to move it...the whole thing falls apart. I think they should add additional connector pieces to help secure the bottom of the towers when stacked together. The plastic provided for the walls of the cubes is not as strong/stiff as I would have liked to see. I thought this system would be perfect for my Horse collection, the plastic is not flat or stable enough for horse figurines to stand on without falling over easily.Sheerness was given three out of five stars. The boxes I received were not sheer at all. Only the doors were see-through. The rest looks like frosted plastic. I guess this would be good to prevent direct sunlight from breaching inside the little cube.Overall four out of five stars. This is a fantastic idea, with genius construction. It took me 3 hours to put together all 12 and get all 12 to lock together. The concept of how these go together is so simple, which is why it's so frustrating when it takes three hours to complete! Also as far as the size goes for these, my husband fits a size 13, and I wear a woman's 9 1/2 or 10. There is no way any shoe can fit in this box side by side unless they are the size of a small elf. Even if you place one shoe on top of the other.I like it. This is a very useful product to organize your home. You do not have to just put shoes on it. Get creative! The price is a bit more than I think it is worth due to the quality of the plastic, and you have to spend half a day to put it together, and then have at least 3 drinks to relax after doing so.",

                "reviewText": "Admittedly, I had low expectations for this but decided to give it a try because with a growing family, I needed a better way to store and organize shoes. I was more than pleasantly surprised with how well this works. Here's what I like about it:1. Sturdier than it looks, especially when you connect a group of them. Upon first opening it, I thought I would regret it. Upon assembling it correctly, however, (just make sure to fold the tabs inward so they snap into place), I was surprised that it turned out to be surprisingly sturdy.2. Easy to assemble. Just follow the directions (or watch the video). Probably took about half an hour to assemble and connect all 12 shoe boxes. I suppose if I were a little more anal, I could have spent longer to make sure everything was perfectly aligned, as a few front covers were slightly sticking out.3. Good ventilation. Aside from the obvious odor possibilities, ventilation is apparently important to the life of a shoe/sneaker. Without good air circulation, shoes will deteriorate faster (look it up). These have holes in the front and the back, so I'm hoping this will be more than adequate.4. Magnetic door. There's obviously several similar products being sold on Amazon, but I chose this for the magnetic front doors, which open and shut nicely and I figure I can fix if it ever breaks, and5. Smaller footprint (no pun intended). I needed boxes that could store a men's size 10 but I also wanted to maximize walkway space so needed ones that weren't too long. The dimensions of this allowed me to do just that, especially compared to the others.",

When you stack them vertically don't apply to much force to the locking mechanism or they will break. You just have to wiggle them in slowly. The connection pieces work fine and I didn't need all 10 for my setup. Once together the rack is fairly sturdy. Not wood sturdy but decent. Would I buy again? Yes, as I just ordered 2 more.",
