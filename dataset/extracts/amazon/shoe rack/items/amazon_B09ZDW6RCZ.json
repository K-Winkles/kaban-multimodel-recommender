The spaces for the shoes (10 W) were adequate, as long as I put them in the slots sideways to begin with.The rack was very easy to put together, requiring minimal time and using just the provided tool. It was not the sturdiest item I have seen but certainly adequate, and for how reasonable the price was it was well worth it.",

I already have a shoe shelf on the floor of the closet that is full, as is the floor space around it. I needed a way to tidy up how I stored my athletic shoes. This shelving unit is perfect. Assembly was fairly easy. Some of the threads inside the support poles weren\u2019t \u201cclean\u201d and the double-ended connectors wouldn\u2019t \u201ccatch.\u201d I had to route them out using a screw and the included Allen key. Once I did that, I could resume assembly. Minor inconvenience. Start to finish it took me about 1/2 hour to complete. The finish is a true dark brown and blends well with the walnut chest of drawers beside it. 9.5/10",

I do not wear shoes in my home as I was raised in an extremely European household, so this fixes my problem of where to put my shoes now that I live in an apartment. This product is super lightweight, looks good, and is easy to assemble. Not only is it easy to assemble, but it's easy to customize as well! I actually left a row off when assembling it so it would be a little shorter than the dimensions listed on the website are. I use the very top of the unit as a place to put my keys and mail, the second shelf for dog leashes, and the rest of the shelves for shoes. One thing I will note is that it does not fit women's boots/heels very well. I have to lay my at an angle/sideways to get two to fit per row, but it doesn't bother me that much. I also have a boot mat that I've placed right under the unit and that extend to the side of it to place shoes I've just worn/wear frequently/are dirty or wet. It's not the most sturdy product on the market, but for the price I would purchase again.",

I had to scrap out that area, not easy, by pounding with a hammer and using small chisel to clean out enough of the plastic to allow the screw to enter..... that was a bit difficult. They should probably send one extra poll and one extra double side screw in case there is another quality control oversight. Had I not been able to break off the extra plastic covering the hole I would have had to return the shoe rack, and missed out on this fabulous product design, which I absolutely LOVE!",

My washer and dryer are black so I found this one. The price was similar and I didn\u2019t think much of it. However compared to my other one it is much smaller, was harder to put together, and much shorter and smaller. Honestly this isn\u2019t great for a shoe rack, maybe for children\u2019s shoes but it\u2019s so small. And it\u2019s not black it\u2019s a dark brown. However, I bought it to use for shelves in my small laundry room and it is perfect for that. Takes up hardly any room and perfect for what I needed it for except it isn\u2019t black. If you purchase this for shelving or a child\u2019s shoe rack this will work but my other one I purchased is a far better shoe rack.",
