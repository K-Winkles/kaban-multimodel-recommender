It was easy to put together, holds all of our kids shoes, does not take up a ton of space, is easy to clean, and is sturdy. We have had it for over a year and it still works as good as new. It even survived a cross country move. Highly recommend.",

His shoes did not fit on the rack because this shoes where to big but mine fit perfectly. You can still make it work by turning them sideways. It\u2019s low to the ground and easy to put in to closest but it breaks easily so be careful. I did disassemble it and traveled with it and so it\u2019s easy to put back up together that\u2019s a huge plus especially since it doesn\u2019t use any nails or screws",

It was nice that they included a pair of white gloves, so you wouldn\u2019t cut yourself on the metal poles, and a small wooden mallet for tapping the pieces together. They also include one extra of each part. Awesome.BUT one of the bags that holds the poles had been torn open, and apparently a couple poles fell out. So I was one pole short and unable to complete putting it together. I contacted the seller, who reached out to me immediately, and told me another would be on the way. I was completely surprised when the next day I received an entire new shoe shelf. I am beyond amazed at the customer service. I\u2019ve had several terrible experiences with customer service through vendors here on Amazon, that this one was really outstanding. 100 stars for customer service.",

It came with spare parts, which were necessary, as there were some small quality issues. The picture I attached is an example of one of the flawed parts, which would've still been useable...but I appreciated having an extra to take it's place. Overall, it looks nice, went together easily, and it was cheap. I'd recommend it. (They did offer a $20 gift card for a 5 star review, but I would've given it five stars regardless).",

We previously had bins for the kids\u2019 shoes, but it always looked messy and the shoes were hard to find. Now there is plenty of space for all their shoes, they are neat and clean, and easy to spot the pair you are looking for! I don\u2019t think I would put anything much heavier than shoes on the shelves, but they are great for shoes. The first set I ordered I put up in a spot where my large dog likes to look out the window, and he did tear the top two shelves-customer service was great and they sent me a replacement right away! Now I know to keep it in a spot where the dog won\u2019t jump up on it. I also have a smaller one for me and my husband\u2019s shoes, and it is just as great.",
