I am able to store a lot of shoes on here, like two-three pairs on the racks. It was very easy to put up, but did take long than expected because there\u2019s a lot of pieces. It\u2019s made of plastic and metal, but does the job very well and I have not had any issues. I didn\u2019t use all of the pieces due to it becoming too large for my closet. A very nice, versatile, and simple shoe rack that brings a lot of storage to your closet and organization.",
