So when I thought I needed to extend this shoe tower I thought just buy another one.....I guess due to reducing product size and rising prices that's what happen. The just delivered shoe tower is smaller than the one bought in 2021. \ud83d\ude44 But with my imagination and zip tied I made it work. If you are a first time buyer this is a GREAT product and like I said I have had the first one for years. I suggest buying 2 and add to it as you need to. I guess The first photo is before and the 2nd photo is after. Note you can only put 2 pair of boots on this tower. Easy to install. Never had an issue of it falling over and its real sturdy. Like I said just don't buy to mate to an existing one.",

                "reviewText": "I needed to get something to cut my cleaning time down , and this fit the bill for sure. Between my husband and I we have TONS of shoes and boots and it used to take me FOREVER to take out ALL of our shoes to vacuum the closet floor and dust in the corners and all that. Now, I can just vacuum right up underneath the shoe racks very easily and slide them around to clean around them also very easily. I will be purchasing a couple more of these definitely. They are also very strong and sturdy. I was worried that for the price they'd be wally and not hold up much weight of boots , sneakers, dress shoes , etc. But they hold up VERY well ! Not wobbly at all ! I keep them tucked behind my clothes that are hanging up and I put my boots along the top rack, heels in the middle, shoes , sneakers and slides on the bottom and underneath (which is why I will be purchasing more, so I can free up all the floor space, again, for easy cleaning). Our closet is split in 2, a top and bottom half , so , having all of our shoes directly underneath my dresses and nice attire was not ideal to say the least. This fits perfectly behind my clothes. I split it into 4 separate shoe racks 2 for me and 2 for him. Again, I will be purchasing more lol. I am super happy with my purchase ! It has created tons of space, cut my closet cleaning time significantly and has made it very easy to organize and access the exact pair of shoes I want exactly when I want them without having to dig around or having an ugly hanging shoe rack. This is hidden right behind my clothing perfectly",

                "reviewText": "This is super easy to put together. I was attracted this because I have a narrow wall by my entryway better served by a taller, narrower shoe rack. BUT you have to stay for the ability to have some different heights for the levels. My bottom level is the tallest, and easily fits snow boots. Most are the standard shoe rack size, but another is high enough to better fit my heeled boots. The levels are a kind of waxed fabric, that does feel a little cheap, but it's totally serviceable, and doesn't affect storing boots that are a little wet, and really make it easier to assemble. I use the top shelf for winter accessories (hats etc) and masks, and it's a great size.",

No tools are required and after getting the first one at the bottom done it was about 10 minutes to complete. It literally weighs nearly nothing. I was skeptical about the shelf because they are paper but very strong similar to Tyvek which is extremely difficult to tear. I was able to put 2 pairs of shoes on each shelf. And after it was full of sneakers my 7 year old granddaughter was able to lift it up a bit. I'm thinking about where I can use another one. Great price and Great product.",
