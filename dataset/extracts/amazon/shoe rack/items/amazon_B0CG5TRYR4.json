It doesn't feel very sturdy and could probably break relatively easily. Being so small, though, it is nice because that allows you to store it just about anywhere. If you're using it for adult shoes, you'll only really be able to fit three pairs, maybe four if you maneuver them a bit. It's not bad for the price and would honestly probably work better for items other than shoes. So if you need some small shelving for display or storage, this would be a pretty good solution.",

It was easy to assemble and being lightweight, it is easy to move around if I need to. There is a decent amount of room for each pair of shoes in the compartments, and with the top platform open, you could put a taller pair on the top if you need to. It does wobble a little more than I expected if you move it, but it hasn't fallen over or apart on me. I like that it's foldable if I need to store it somewhere at some point. I think it's a good value for the price also.",

                "reviewText": "It literally pulls up then you click the sides \"locked\" in the full open position and you're done! It's sturdy enough but because of the basic design it does have flex & a wobble. Fpr me the flex or wobble doesn't matter because it's designed for shoes or lighter weight things & this is how I intend to use it. All this being said it can support the weight of my husband's heavier steel toed Red Wing boots on the top shelf. I like that it's a great space saver & that it's easy to pop up or close down. I love that it has a bit of a lip on each shelf to catch any remaining water or snow as we live in a seasonal weather state. The flaws of this stand are minor but may be significant for some. I included a side pic with my review to show that a size 7-8 women's slipper fits just to the edge of the shelf & that a man's size 9.5-10 shoe hangs over. Now this will only be a concern for some but this means that anything that drips off a higher shoe may end up on a lower one if you have shoes in a size range above a women's size 7-8. The other key thing is that boots, even low height ones, like my ankle high slipper boots, do not fit in the lower 2 shelves at all! The entire shelf itself isn't Fort Knox so you realistically wouldn't want to use this alternatively for holding heavy things like full water bottles but it could work for empty insulated thermos tumblers or cups on their side stacked up pyramid style or tea boxes or something light. Overall, I am happy with this purchase & will be using it as intended. Hope this helps someone make their decision!",

                "reviewText": "I thought this would work great for my sheets in my bathroom closet so when I got it, it was very easy to put together as it was already assembled. You just have to snap the things together and you have instant three tears of shelves. The plastic is just an OK material. It\u2019s not the best, but it\u2019s not the worst either. They would work for children\u2019s shoes perhaps or a small footed person they look like they are 8 x 8 x 8 it\u2019s just not as big as I thought it would be but I did use it for another project around the house in my pantry, so I guess it was a win-win",

                "reviewText": "This is so handy to have! I know it is sold as a shoe organizer, and that should work very well - but I am actually using it on my desk to organize some papers! Since it's collapsible, it's very easy to store when not in use, and I can see it in use for multiple purposes.One thing to improve might be offering a way of securing the foldable joints. This might provide more stability.",

It collapses in a couple of seconds for when you don't want to use it to just a couple inches high, and then you can tuck it away behind something or under something really easily.Really big shoes might not fit in it, but it fits my size 9 1/2 shoes without issue, as well as some of my friends with around 10-11m US.",
