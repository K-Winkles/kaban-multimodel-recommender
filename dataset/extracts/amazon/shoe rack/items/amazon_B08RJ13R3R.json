Also the boxes are not clear more of a frost color. That\u2019s not a big deal. But the instructions to assemble were hard to follow. I finally watched a review video on how to put them together and it was simple to follow. Recommend watching his video review. Boxes are nice for the price point. I bought the XXL boxes for my son. It is definitely wall to wall with his size 14 shoe. Some of the shoes are too big/bulky for the boxes but overall fits the majority of his men\u2019s size 14.",

They look great, stack well and fit both low top and mids. The mids I did turn on thier side and back to front. Still looks great.Sneaker size 8M - 9M and 9W-10WShoe box size L*I Used tabs on the side to stack. Held well. Only one tab cracked, most likely user error.Would highly recommend if you want a trendy, stylish and affordable option for your shoe and sneaker storage/display.",

The sides must be bent into a \u201cbox\u201d shape, and then the front and back are attached. Easy assembly. Doors are \u201chinged\u201d.

                "reviewText": "The SEE SPRING Large 12 Pack Shoe Storage Box is a clear plastic stackable shoe organizer that can help you keep your closet organized and save space. Here's a review that includes both the pros and cons of this product:Pros:Space-saving: These shoe storage boxes are stackable, which means that you can store multiple pairs of shoes in a small amount of space. This is especially helpful if you have a small closet or limited storage space.Easy to see: The clear plastic design of the shoe boxes makes it easy to see what shoes are inside without having to open the box.Easy to clean: The plastic material is easy to wipe clean and is durable enough to last for a long time.Foldable: The shoe boxes can be easily folded flat when not in use, which makes them easy to store and transport.Cons:Limited size options: These shoe boxes only come in one size, which may not be suitable for larger shoes or boots.Durability: Some users have reported that the plastic material is not as durable as they would like and that the boxes can crack or break easily if not handled carefully.No air circulation: The boxes do not have any ventilation holes, which may cause shoes to become musty or develop an odor if left in the boxes for a long time.Overall, the SEE SPRING Large 12 Pack Shoe Storage Box is a good option for those looking for a space-saving and easy-to-use shoe organizer. While there are some cons to consider, the clear plastic design, ease of cleaning, and foldable design make these boxes a convenient and practical solution for organizing your shoes.",

                "reviewText": "I gave this product 5 stars because it accomplished what I wanted to accomplish for a favorable price compared to research I\u2019ve done on similar products. So for me, it works. For people interested in this product and reading reviews, I want to be helpful:Assembly: Requires patience, especially on the first couple. Not for those who easily get frustrated. While trying to assemble the first box, I thought for sure I would returning but I stuck with it, and they got easier as I went on. Took me an hour to assemble the 12 boxes and stack as shown in the pictures.Display: If you are looking to \u201cdisplay\u201d your prized sneaker or heals collection, this is not the product as you can see from my images. The clear boxes are not so clear as you can see. Theres a cross web likely for sturdiness. Again, this was okay with me because I was simply trying to protect my shoes, and get them stacked rather the taking up space on the floor.Size: After opening the box and seeing the door size, I thought for sure I\u2019d have to return. I missed the top to bottom size when determining whether or not to purchase, but it\u2019s clearly in the product images, and it\u2019s only 6\u201d for the XL version (5\u201d for the regular). My highest sneaks are Jordan 4s. These JUST fit and I had to put them in sideways through the door, then flip upright. I am not sure how tall high heals go, but take note if you wear them. My Timberlands and Nike ACGs will not fit in these.Takeaways: If you want to display your shoe collection, this is not for you. If you have shoes or sneakers over 6\u201d tall, this is not for you. If you want to protect your shoes/sneakers completely, be able to stack them to save floor space, and are willing to take the time to assemble, this is a great cost effective solution.",
