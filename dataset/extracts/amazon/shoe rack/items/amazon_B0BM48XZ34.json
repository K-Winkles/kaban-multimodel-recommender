All the pieces are plastic but aren\u2019t super cheap, the shoe rack isn\u2019t super solid but that doesn\u2019t have to do with the construction of it more because the material isn\u2019t wood or something more solid which I thought was going to bother me more with being a family of 6 and four of those six are two older children and a husband with large work boots, works great. Looks esthetically pleasing! We also just purchased this again 6 this time to add on for more space for shoes (we have a large family lol).",

It fits big boots easily, although you may only be able to fit one pair in each if your boot is big. I was skeptical of the quality and build, but I like it so much I am going to order another one so i can store my family's shoes.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the SONGMICS Shoe Rack and have been quite impressed with its functionality. What stands out the most is the spacious design of each cube, comfortably accommodating two pairs of shoes instead of just one, effectively doubling the storage capacity. The doors on the unit are remarkably easy to use, allowing for quick and hassle-free access to the shoes. My only critique is the limited color option; the rack is only available in white, which, while sleek, can show dirt quite easily. Offering this shoe rack in more colors would be a great improvement, as it would cater to different interior styles and preferences. Overall, this organizer is a practical and efficient solution for shoe storage, especially for those needing to maximize space",

                "reviewText": "My shoes have been stacked & piled on various types of shoe racks over the years, none of which worked quite right for me. I'm glad to finally find one that will keep them organized AND clean! It wasn't hard to put together but it took awhile. A tool is included that will help get it done. It says 8 cubes (which makes it sound like 8 individual, standalone cubes) but it's really 4 cubes that are double wide with a divider in the middle, and double tall, so each cube has room for 4 pairs of shoes. It all snaps together snugly and is fairly sturdy. The solid top, bottom, & sides are all soft vinyl. It feels good, but I'd be very careful about putting too much weight directly on the vinyl as it would probably eventually tear where it connects to the frame. I keep wanting to set stuff on the top of the unit, but have to remind myself to stop. The weight of shoes is fine, but probably not a heavy pile of clothes. My only complaint is that it comes with 4 cubes and my closet space is only tall enough to stack 3 of them, so I have the 4th extra cube that I'd like to use somewhere else, but there's only 1 piece of the top/bottom vinyl so it can't be used as standalone unit (unless the top or bottom is left open, which sort of defeats the purpose of keeping the dust out). I contacted the manufacturer directly and they don't (or won't) ship just that 1 extra piece. Kinda pisses me off cuz I know they've got it. They just won't provide it. The unit \"looks\" modular, and could very easily BE modular, but it's missing that one piece that pretty much makes it HAVE to be used in just that 1 configuration that's shown in the picture (4 cubes high, each of them double wide). I'm still giving it 5 stars because I do love the 3 pieces I can use, but protesting that one annoying design flaw. (Manufacturer, are you reading this??)",
