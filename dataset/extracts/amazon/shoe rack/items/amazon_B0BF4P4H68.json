                "reviewText": "Our old shoe rack was a mix of wood and metal. It was OK, but was old and needed to be replaced. I looked long and hard for a shoe rack that would fit our space, and finally found this one.This thing is very substantial. I was surprised carrying the box up the stairs. It was heavy, like 50 pounds. Easy to assemble, not more than 30 minutes.While this is a bit shorter than our old shoe rack, it holds as many shoes. We are able to fit 3 adult pairs of shoes in each shelf, though you may have to alternate orientation - so 1 faces out and 2 face in.Overall, super happy with this purchase. Would definitely recommend.",
