One of its perks is you can easily customize the set up to suit what you're looking for - in my case, I needed A LOT of boot spaces. Instead of installing all 4 bars for each row, I only installed the back two and can fit everything I need to. As a result, I did have some left over pieces (of course), but I just tossed them. It was pretty easy to move (despite the bulk) when the rack was empty, and once the shoes are on seems sturdy enough. Haven't had any issues so far. None of the parts came in damaged, as well!",

                "reviewText": "So the good: it is sturdy, lightweight, and easy to assemble.The not-so-good: In the image, there are several pairs of high-heel shoes featured. Looking closely, it appears that the heals are supported by more than tubular poles which is what I was hoping. The materials under the heels in the picture advertised looks much broader than a tube. Well, while the shelving system does come with six \"sheets\" of plastic material as pictured, each of the other shelves are 4 tubes with wide gaps in between. The back of all of my heels fall straight through and the front of each shoe sticks upward. Not helpful. I wish they would have included a sheet of the black plastic material for each shelf.If you are looking to use this for lots of high-heeled shoes like I was, look elsewhere.But if you need to store tennis shoes and a few pairs of tall boots, this could work perfectly. It really is a nice shoe storage system, it just doesn't meet my needs without more of the sheets to prevent my heels from falling through.",
