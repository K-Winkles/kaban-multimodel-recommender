I can comfortably fit 4-5 pair of large tennis shoes side-by-side style on each rack, and 6-8 pairs for smaller dress shoes/flip flops/etc. Tall boots (like winter ones) must go on top to fit. Feels sturdy and I especially liked that this model is longer than most for spaces that can accommodate the extra length. I did have to replace the first one I received because it was missing the button on one of the legs to clip it in place, but things like that happen and the second arrived without issue. I recommend this one.",

It took this old grandma about 20 minutes.I can fit about 6 pairs of shoes on each shelf and under the rack...found out I don't have as many shoes as I thought! If you stack sandals & flip flops on top of each other, you can get more on the shelf.The rack is pretty sturdy, the shelves are made of what looks like heavyweight tightly woven mesh fabric.I would have purchased the 4-tier rack, but it's too tall to fit under my clothes.",

It holds a lot of shoes, and there's a choice on where to put one of the shelves, to allow for taller shoes if needed.",
