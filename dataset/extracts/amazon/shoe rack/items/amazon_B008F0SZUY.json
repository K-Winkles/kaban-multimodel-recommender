Of course it isn\u2019t as sturdy as wooden shoe racks, such as the bamboo kind, but for what I want, it\u2019s exact. (I wouldn\u2019t want this for my closet, to store 10 pairs of shoes, but I also wouldn\u2019t want THAT kind of shoe rack to sit out.) This rack is well made and super easy to assemble. Minimalist packaging too.",
