                "reviewText": "Shelf was a cute idea but was constructed wrong. It has lots of extra holes, holes in the wrong places so that you can\u2019t align the screws in to make the shelves sturdy, and in some spots there isn\u2019t any screw holes at all. The top shelf is not connected at all on the right side and does not screw in to the posts in the mid right section because the holes are not aligned. I even turned the sections around to see if they went another direction. It also does not come with self tapping screws either so I\u2019m gonna have to drill my own holes or cut my losses.",

                "reviewText": "None of the pieces were labeled, the directions were terrible, and it asked for the wrong kind of screw driver. It said you need a Philips, but all the screws were allen head. It did come with a tiny little allen wrench that was almost impossible to use. The holes and notches didn\u2019t line up properly so it looks pretty cheap. Finally got it put together and it\u2019s a good size but not very sturdy. The wood is very thin. Returning would be too much of a hassle so I\u2019m going to keep and hope for the best. I decided to put it in the closet so I can wedge it in against a wall and hopefully it will hold up",
