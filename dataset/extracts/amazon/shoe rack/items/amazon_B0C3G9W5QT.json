            "\u3010STURDY COMPACT CONSTRUCTION\u3011 Featuring a compact profile, our free standing shoe racks adopt high-quality PP connectors and sturdy smooth electrophoretic coated metal tubes, which enables this shoe organizer load to be much heavier duty and more durable while using. And the electrophoretic coated finish does not rust or corrode with normal use and greatly enhances the service life.",
            "\u3010DIY AS YOUR NEED\u3011 There are holes on both sides of the middle connectors, making the shoe shelf easy for you to assemble and split them into 8-layer, 7-layer, or even 3-layer shoe racks. You can DIY the shape according to your own family needs, and meet the needs of different scenarios. Such as the entryway, closet, living room and garage.",

Once you put the pieces together its really hard to pull them back apart without a piece braking. I would suggest lay the format out before putting it together. Once put together it it pretty sturdy, I like the space and order I have in my room now though, It'll do for now.",

I like that it has a couple tall spots for boots. And the added hooks on the side are a bonus! Plenty of space now for all my shoes - I feel so much more organized! Be sure to use the wall straps that are included, to keep it from tipping over - especially if you have it on carpet, which mine is. It stands up well, but once you load it up, it could be top-heavy and tip when you are pulling something off the top shelf.",
