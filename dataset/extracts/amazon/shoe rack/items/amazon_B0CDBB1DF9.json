                "reviewText": "Love how sturdy this shoe tower is. My previous one would lean. The design of this is more durable and can handle more weight!The configurability was key. I did not have the same space as described, but the modular design gave me flexibility and I can use the remaining pieces to make a small shoe rack elsewhere in the house.Only downside is some of my wedges or booties are too tall for the space, but I would hate to give up a whole row just for an extra inch vertically. Same with heels, most stick down to the row below or you can put a layer of something across the bars to keep them from falling through. Might have been nice to have a bar 1-2 nches up to hold the heels at an angle? But then you have the same vertical challenge. Not sure how to fix the design, but it still works well enough for me. (I might have too many shoes!)",
