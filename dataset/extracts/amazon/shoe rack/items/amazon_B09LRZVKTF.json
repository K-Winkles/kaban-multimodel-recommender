                "reviewText": "The box the shoe organizer was delivered in was very heavy, giving us hope about the quality and sturdiness that was found to be true. The assembly was simple and didn't take long at all. We love the option for the shelves to be tipped or flat, and we ended up doing the bottom three shelves tipped and one flat for my purse. We wear women's US shoe size 10.5-12 which were too long for the tipped shelves to be used with the lip holding them in unless the structure was moved an inch or two from the wall. We played around with it and decided to place the shoes on the lip still gaining some tilt but keeping the back flush with the wall. The top is great quality wood for the price. It has slight texture to it and not a faux wood look printed onto it. We're quite happy with this purchase and the design allows us to change the layout as our needs change over time.",

                "reviewText": "I recently added this shoe shelf with a flat top to my home, and overall, I'm quite pleased with its performance, meriting a solid four-star rating. The first thing that stands out is its sturdiness. It feels robust and reliable, easily bearing the weight of multiple pairs of shoes without any sign of strain.Aesthetically, the shelf is a winner. It has a sleek and modern look that fits well in my space, and the flat top adds a touch of practicality, serving as an additional counter space for various uses.However, there's a slight drawback concerning its dimensions, especially for those with larger shoe sizes. I wear a size 10, and I've noticed that the toes of my shoes extend beyond the back of the shelf. This means I can't place the shelf flush against the wall; it needs to be about an inch or two away to accommodate my shoes. While this isn't a deal-breaker, it's a point worth noting for potential buyers with larger feet.A bit more width would make this shelf perfect for my needs. That said, it's still a valuable addition to my home, offering both storage and style. It's a great choice for anyone seeking a shoe storage solution that combines functionality with a modern aesthetic, keeping in mind the slight space adjustment for larger shoe sizes.",

At that point I was not gonna go back lol. Nice, sturdy, and heavier then expected piece.",

The shelves are far enough apart that slip on boots will fit, my size 14's fit ok as well which is a bonus. It looks nice, is sturdy and wasn't too hard to assemble, it came with all the bits and pieces as well as a couple extras, which is handy should any bolts strip out. Also came with the tools needed to assemble. I like that the shelves can be assembled flat or slanted or a combination of both, I'm thinking of changing the bottom shelf to flat to give easier access for the larger shoes and boots.",
