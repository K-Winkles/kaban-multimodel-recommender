                "reviewText": "Very pleased with this shoe rack. I was sent the wrong color but chose to keep it rather than exchange and the seller was very courteous and even refunded me a portion of the price. I love the added storage and overall look of the shoe rack. Only fault would be that each end of each shelf has limited width due to the supports on the back. Still totally usable though. Box was somewhat damaged when received and one of the shelves had some damage but was easily hidden.",

                "reviewText": "I love the looks of this shelf and the top pocket/cubby storage is perfect. It fits a lot of little doodads. I like when I walk in the door I can drop my purse and such on top. Very convenient.The drawback is the shelf is too shallow. This makes it feel unstable, like it will tip easily. Also, if you\u2019re shoe size is larger than a six, your shoes will definitely hangover.I\u2019m assuming the shelf is sturdy by other reviews. Mine isn\u2019t because my dear DIL installed a top piece backwards, so the whole thing is a little wonky and wobbly. Disappointed in that but if the manufacturer makes this cute shelf deeper for larger size shoes, I would definitely purchase another. Obviously it would cost more but I\u2019d definitely rather pay more for a better, more fitting product.",
