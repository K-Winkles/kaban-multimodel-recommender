It fit perfectly where we need it to in our closet and it's been durable and reliable for us. We've had it for months now and we're happy with this decision. Definitely going to keep this one. Sizing is true and I can fit about 4-5 pair of shoes on each row, depending on the bulkiness of the shoe. My husband has bulkier shoes and he fits about 3-4 on each row.",
