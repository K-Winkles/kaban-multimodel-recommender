                "reviewText": "No matter how many times my kids organized their shoes in their closet, they never stayed that way. They would always end up just throwing them back in there and then the next morning they'd never be able to find the other matching shoe. I decided to order this shoe rack to see if it would help keep things organized and make all of our lives a little easier during the morning rush to get everyone off to where they need to be on time. I know you know exactly what I'm talking about. I got my older daughter her's first. It was a success. Shoes were put back on it every single time, matches stayed right next to each other. I also like that there are little pouches on the side, because they're a perfect size to put their flip flops in so you don't need to waste space on the rack. I went ahead and then bought my younger one her own rack, and same thing. Their closets look so much better and we no longer have to waste time in the morning looking for matches. These shoe racks also get bonus points because they're so easy to clean! All you need to do is get a wet towel and they wipe right off. That was something important to me when I was looking for a rack. I also was looking for something that wasn't huge, because my older daughter's closet isn't all that big, and I knew I would need 2 racks since I couldn't get the taller ones due to her clothing needing room to hang down. I would definitely recommend these as they work great and they're priced pretty well.",
