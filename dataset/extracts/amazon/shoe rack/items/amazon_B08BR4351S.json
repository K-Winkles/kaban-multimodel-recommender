Had a helper get the first few shelves in, but one could do it by yourself with some patience. Don\u2019t tighten screws until all shelves are loosely in place. The top wood shelf helps the aesthetic & handy. Fits 3 pairs of men\u2019s size 9 shoes on one shelf (photo, LEFT tall rack) with some room to spare.",

It's very easy to keep missing it once the thing is installed.It's also decently sturdy though has some wobble, which is expected given its overall height + metal gauge construction. Moreover, it has sufficient space for my suddenly blossoming addiction with sneakers.Can't complain for its intended design but could definitely be cheaper to make it a a 5-Star product overall.",

It was a bit more than what I wanted to spend, but all worth it!! We keep it by the entrance door in the garage and everyone who comes through there raves about it. All of them asked where we got it from and very impressed. It did take some time to put it together... watch out for the front and back screw placement. Great purchase!!!",
