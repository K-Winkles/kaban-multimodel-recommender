These fit perfectly side by side in a small section of wall where not much else could fit there. It holds a lot of shoes and is fairly sturdy. It has helped my girls keep their shoes more organized and put away and not on their floors.The shelves do take a little while to put together. They're not difficult to put together but do take some time. It's definitely important to pay attention to the direction you put the fabric shelf pieces in because they are sewn one way or the other and if you'd like your shelf to look the most cohesive, don't get them flipped.",

As a stand-alone, it is not level or very sturdy. It feels like it could topple over easily. But my handy husband had some zip ties with tabs to screw into the wall. We placed 4 screws to keep it level and in place. Now it feels sturdy and is working great!!",
