It was pretty simple to put together maybe took about 15 or 20 minutes to finish it up. Light and simple packaging. the rack is great for tight fit small spaces! The cover is nice as well so you dont have to just have all your shoes on display when guests are over, or you can probably use the rack as just storage for shoes that are not in use to put away in the closet!",
