Took about half an hour to assemble by myself with no other tools required. Instructions were easy to follow.Fits my (size 9.5-10 women\u2019s), my husband\u2019s (size 10-10.5 men\u2019s), and toddler\u2019s shoes without issue. The smaller shelf is perfect for her to sit and put her shoes on.I spent HOURS researching shoe storage and finally decided on this. We don\u2019t have a lot of room to work with so we had to find something compact but holds a decent amount. Would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The shoe rack is very nice, I love the way it looks and fully assembled it seems to be sturdy so far. The measurements they give are accurate, but the photo shopped pictures of their product showing shoes on it is misleading to say the least.The 4 smaller shelves can fit 3 pairs of shoes if the aren't too chunky, but hight wise a small ankle boot will be a tight fit. The taller shelf can fit two pairs of shoes and maybe one more solo shoe.So ya overall I like the shoe rack and since a looked at the measurements and compared them to my needs it was a good purchase for me. Though if you have more decorative chunky shoes this rack might not be what you need, or if you have a lot of taller shoes or boots.Hope this helps!",

The rack that the shoes go on is a hard metal mesh. The top bench part looks nice and works great for a bench or area to hold purses/ backpacks. Bonus was I had baskets that fit in one of the shelves to keep gloves/ hats in! Overall, I am very happy and would definitely recommend this bench!",

I don\u2019t use it to store boots, but I currently have 14 pairs of sneakers and sandals on it. The top is also very nice and great for storing daily items as well!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this 3-tier shoe rack bench for my entryway and have found it to be a practical addition to my home. Assembly was a breeze, which is always a plus. Its main strength lies in its storage capability \u2013 it efficiently organizes shoes and boots, keeping my entryway tidy. The top tier provides a convenient surface for setting down items like keys and mail when coming and going.Although it is marketed as a bench, I would exercise caution when using it for seating. While it's sturdy enough to hold various footwear and miscellaneous items, it doesn't inspire confidence as a seat. It seems to be more reliable for lighter loads, and I'm hesitant to put my full weight on it regularly.For anyone looking to streamline their shoe storage without sacrificing style, this shoe rack bench is a solid choice. Just be mindful that it might be best reserved for lighter use if you're considering it for a seat.",
