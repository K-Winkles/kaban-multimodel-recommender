                "reviewText": "At the time of reviewing this, this item is $6.99 and realistically for that price it\u2019s pretty good. It took me about 5 minutes tops to put together which is a plus. The part that holds the shoes is metal and the parts connecting them are plastic. There were a few times the metal pole slipped out on one end and times I had to just push down to get it to sit flat and not be slanted but it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I just wanted an extra shoe rack for the back door where guests don\u2019t come in but we do. It\u2019s not amazing quality or anything but definitely good for the price!",
