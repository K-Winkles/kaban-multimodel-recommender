It fits a good amount of children sized shoes, pretty easy to put together as well.",

This fit great - it was a bit tall but I just left the very top shelf off and it is working perfect. It fits the space so much better than the small units you can pick up at your local store, so it gives a lot more rooms for shoes.It only took about 15 minutes to put together, and it was incredibly easy to do so. Sturdy enough to hold the shoes without problem but still light and easy to move around wherever you want. The material on the shelves feels like it would be really easy to clean, and durable against ripping.Would recommend 10/10",
