This little shoe rack aspires to be the fanciest shoe rack in the world and I\u2019m rooting for it. Until its dreams come true, I\u2019m hoping it will continue holding my shoes and not cave in like a dying star. Also, Chihuahua for scale. His name is Riley and he\u2019s very old but even he respects the shoe rack. Be like Riley, shoe some respect.TL:DR: I kind of like it for its basic design, annoying to build and horrendous quality. I\u2019d recommend it for someone who wants a shoe rack but can\u2019t justify spending $30+ on Amazon anymore. It\u2019s awful but I\u2019ve come to love its simplicity.TL:DR for the TL:DR: Buy it or don\u2019t, it\u2019s your money:)",

I have to say that the vendor and/or Amazon sent me a replacement within 48 hours! The rack is good for lightweight shoes such as athletic shoes and flats such as slippers and flat street shoes. I say this because overall the rack is a tiny bit wobbly/not 100% sturdy. It looks great in my closet and my shoes look organized. Good price for this type of shoe rack.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Background: I have been scouting for a bamboo shoe rack for the past few weeks. I didn't nneed anything fancy; after all, its just going to house my dirty shoes. Finally saw this one on sale for $20 and thought it seemed like a fair price for three levels.Unboxing and assembly: It came in three folded, hinged \"panels\" and six rods. There were 13 screws and 6 wooden pegs to join the single and double levels. It wasn't very intuitive but the instructions were sufficient. It took me (a not very \"handy\" person) about 20 minutes to assemble. I did crack one of the panels, so be ware not to over-tighten the screws!Results: I can see why others have called it flimsy. The bamboo is on the thin side (around 1 cm thick). That said, it doesn't wobble a lot when shaken (see video). The multiple layers (aka 1 single layer with a second double layer) seems weird. The joint between the two parts is noticeable (see pic). All that said, I wasn't looking for anything more than a basic shoe rack and that's what I got. I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it. The less $, the better because it is very lightweight (although I wouldn't use the word flimsy). If you looking for something robust, this isn't the shoe rack for you.",
