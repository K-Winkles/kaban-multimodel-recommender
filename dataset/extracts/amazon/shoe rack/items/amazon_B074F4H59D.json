                "reviewText": "I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Before this, she had an inexpensive shoe rack that was made out of plastic and it was very flimsy. The only way to re-enforce it was using a bungee cord. I bought this for her and she is so happy with it. It fits perfectly under the window and holds lots of shoes.I can always tell about the quality of a product like this when I assemble it. This is very good quality. It is not fake wood, but solid bamboo. All the hardware is good quality. All the holes are drilled well and line up well, except for one hole. When I put the screw in that one hole I could hear the wood split. As soon as I hear it, I backed out the screw and re drilled that hole. I used some wood glue and a clamp and now it is perfect.I do not hold that small issue against my positive review because it was so easy to fix. I would highly recommend this shoe rack for anyone. Super high quality and worth every penny.",

I had a messy pile of shoes and random stuff on the floor of my closet and now it looks organized and there is so much floor space. I found cute canvas bins that fit perfectly on the shelves for my small items. The shelves are super easy to put together and very sturdy and solid. There are holes and joining pegs if you want to stack the shelves on top of each other. Just check the measurements so that you know what you are getting and if it will fit your needs.",

My students are 5-6 years old and these are the perfect height for them being used as \"store shelves\" I bought 2 medium racks for them to use and it holds so many food items. If you do plan on using these for pretend play, note: the gaps in between are sometimes too big for the food items. You will need to put some weight to the food items to keep them from falling easily. Or you can add a tray on top of each shelf to prevent them from falling over. They have held up so nicely the last two years and will probably last for many more years!",

This is perfect because it is so shallow, but wider and taller than other options we found. A great look and equally impressed with the amount of storage it offers.We have now seen several of this exact brand/piece already assembled in our local (national chain) discount home goods shop for a bit cheaper, but this was also easy to assemble.NOTE: Since these are technically sold as stackable shoe racks, it does come with 4 connector dowels plus 4 matching holes in the top and bottom, which are tough to spot in product photos so check out our review pics. Not so nice looking, but they can be quickly and easily disguised with wood putty, hole plugs from the hardware store, or just do like we did - cut the included dowels short enough then hammer in (finished end up of course) until they are flush.",
