The only unfortunate thing, it really only fits sneakers or low shoes on the bottom 3 rows. If you have ankle boots, they can go on top, anything taller might have to stay on the floor. This is holding 12 pairs of my shoes, I wear women's 9 - 10. For me this works perfect, great price and so far seems sturdy. Good buy! :)",

Too awkward, too small to be practical.This thing changed all that. It took about five minutes to assemble (a Philips-head screwdriver is the only tool you need, and they even include one). It really is that easy.The package includes a (screw-in) wall brace, because if you buy TWO of them, they stack perfectly. The brace is for the top section, which would otherwise tip over at that height.What good is it if it's not strong, though? I pulled that \"Closet Maid\" type thing out, and put this in. Then I filled the racks with shoes that were otherwise all over the doggone place.It is completely SOLID. I grabbed it and shook it, expecting it to wobble or warp, but it did nothing of the sort. Most enthusiastically recommended, especially at this price!",
