The only real problem is that the directions suck so badly, because there\u2019s a key piece of info that is not made clear, as can be seen in so many of the reviews here.Please look at the accompanying photo and note that the hooks go OVER each little rail, but the center nib has to go UNDER it.It\u2019s easy to do because all you have to do is pull the bottom rail out a little (it\u2019s flexible) and pop the nib under it. No tools are needed, just your fingers.Hope this helps.",

I saw the idea on Pinterest and wanted an easier way to clean around any cases without having to actually keep hauling the case around. My husband is someone skilled at putting things together but I think he was close to having me send this one back. The paper instructions in the box were frustrating and after he was done he had this to say. The instructions on the outside of the actual box was so much clearer and he wished he seen that first !!!",

I had to push my washer and dryer over to get it in the space.There are no tools needed to put this together, the shelves just sit on top of the sides. You will need to lean one side up against something to get the first shelf on.It does have a rubber coating so it's durable and waterproof if the bottom on your shoes are wet. I did have to leave one shelf out to get my boots on but if you are just using it for regular flat shoes you can utilize all 4 shelves.",

The first time was terrible, trying to figure out how much finagling was necessary to get everything to stay together. To say it's a labor of love is probably spot on. The second time around, no sweat (maybe a little).The main issue is the little plastic connectors are all held by friction, and because of that, you really got to mash those bad boys down. I figured out the best way the second time around. You loosely attach 3 or so panels together and flip what you have around, and mash the connectors down with a rag-to-hand barrier.With that out of the way, they're just so versatile. Rather than make a 2x3, I just have two separate ones that I can pick up and move around when it's most convenient. They hold a fair amount of both weight and volume, and they're not bad to look at surprisingly. Love em.",

On a level hard surface floor, this thing wobbles as if it is in a constant earthquake. Feels shifty, and cheap when you touch it. I'm fare at assembling furniture. And this thing is fairly straight forward as far as directions for assembly. BUT, the screws are almost too small to fit into the holes, and I recommend a power drill to actually bolt the screws down, I think a normal screwdriver would be more work than what is already required of this flimsy thing. lOOK AROUND AND FIND SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOUR MONEY.",
