                "reviewText": "This was a great purchase. It\u2019s not too wide so it fits nicely in our main hallway. It took some time to build but the instructions were very easy to read and follow. My only word of warning is for large shoes and steel toes. Both my husband and I need steel toes for work he wears a 13, they did not fit into the drawers not even mine. Each drawer has 2 levels, I took the top board out of one of the bottom drawers so it was only one level and the steel toes and my husband\u2019s monster shoes fit in just fine. Glad I got the 4 door one and not the 2 door. Very pleased with the purchase. It looks great and we are using it daily.",

It also doesn't take up much space so if you had a narrow space to put it in, it'll still be really nice. Only flaws I can see with it is that it's not really sturdy without anchoring it to the wall and I can't fit my husband's work boots in it.",
