                "reviewText": "First off - this weight bench had THE BEST DIRECTIONS of anything I ever put together!!!! As an \"older\" married man (64) with 3 grown children and a house, I have spent many a Christmas Eve putting together bicycles and toys, as well as home furniture and various lawn items. The directions were simple and clearly written. All small parts, screws and bolts are bubble wrapped and clearly marked and numbered on a single large cardboard sheet. No lost or missing parts and clear directions! I could not have been happier. The bench itself is fairly sturdy. I have no complaints - but for comparison I'm 5' 8\" and 170 pounds. The most I bench is about 140 - so I don't know how it would work with a larger person bench pressing 250. For me it's fine. I might also add - the leg attachment is one of the best I've ever seen in a home weight bench and is a welcomed addition. My only complaint is that it is a little high up. I can't put my feet flat on the ground when I'm bench pressing. Other than that - overall I'm very happy with this weight bench.",

                "reviewText": "Sad I have to go to a company that appears to be out of business now for these types of fitness equipment, to find something that's actually QUALITY BUILT.I spent hours trying to find a good strong Rack of this type of design, and they ALL on Amazon are cheap China made JUNK.This is the ONLY one that wasn't.... I couldn't even find it in Amazon's SEARCH, had to go outside of Amazon and THEN I found a link to this product.I had the same problem with finding a Quality Weight Bench, had to go to a big Western made product company to get actual quality, while NONE of bench's at Amazon were any good.The difference between this and the weight bench is I couldn't find any Western company making a RACK of this type of design. Weider was the ONLY ONE I could find.I was lucky to even get this, because Weider is apparently out of business, not making Strength equipment anymore. It looks like whomever owns the company now is getting rid of whatever leftovers they still have.Sad day... Amazon needs to get some \"quality control\" with products they allow to be sold on the site.There are MANY things I've needed to buy and STILL need to buy, and nothing is made well anymore and it's been an absolute NIGHTMARE to find anything of quality of the things I've needed to buy over the last few years because most things come from China now, and they just don't make most things well.Like, I STILL can't get a handheld Wet Carpet Cleaner because they are ALL so poorly made now, in contrast to one I had years ago, which only don't have cause of losing family and having to sell everything off.Anyway... Not happy with Amazon. Especially when I just bought several products, designated a specific delivery day, and they are ALL being delivered DIFFERENT DAYS, over an ENTIRE WEEK. :(",

                "reviewText": "For a classic home gym, this is a great bench. For serious weightlifters, you will need something more stable. The bench is well made, powder coated and when put together, quite solid. We've use it for bench press and leg lifts. For moderate use, you can't beat this bench - not much pricier than some used bench on Craig's list and this is brand new, clean, you know what you are getting, and have a return policy. We use this with a 7' Olympic bar - we originally purchased a 5' bar thinking it would save space but the collars hit against the support rails - you will need a 6' or 7' bar. Again, for a reasonable home gym, this bench is great value. I've been mostly benching 225lbs and it feels like I am just about pushing the limits based on the flex when I replace weights+bar, I haven't tried it with 245, but I am a little concerned that I would really be pushing its' limits. On my other bench at a different house, I ended up welding on a support rail from the top of each side support to the floor - insuring the weight of the bar+weights wouldn't bend the side supports. If I did that with this bench, it would be VERY stable. The only other issue - and it was the same with my other bench - is the bench itself. First, since the bench itself is flexible, i.e., it needs to be able to move from flat to almost vertical for leg lifts, it isn't as stable as I'd like. Second, it isn't as wide at the shoulders as I'd like. I removed the leg-lift mechanism from my other bench and replaced the bench with a stronger, wider cushion.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 6'3\" 220 and this bench is plenty long and wide enough for me. Assuming I'll eventually have to upgrade to one with higher weight limit but I paid 27 dollars and would have been satisfied paying full price. It also doubles as a nice chair with better posture support than my 100+ dollar ergonomic gaming chair. More comfortable for my height as it has a long back that doesn't encourage my head or back leaning forward. Assembly was fairly quick, I think it good to tighten the bolts for the folding feature quite a bit, not so much that it's difficult to move but enough that there is a friction. This prevents rattling and makes the bench more stable.",

                "reviewText": "this bench has a few cons that i'll get out of the way first.1. feet are uneven and as a result, there is a slight wobble. i've unscrewed and re-screwed several times, hasn't solved the problem.2. the long side of the bench wobbles much more, due to the adjusting mechanism. i doubt it would cause you and bench to tip over, but when laying down with some heavy dumbbells, it will definitely catch your attention.3. the adjusting mechanism is sloppy and annoying to use. you have to remove a pin, adjust the bench, line up the adjustment rod with the two holes on the beam, and re-insert the pin. there is a ton of play, so it always takes a few seconds of blindly poking around before you get the pin setwith that out of the way, i'd say this is a decent bench for the price. i'm 6'2\" and this bench is perfect in length for me. i would look for something sturdier if you're benching 225 or more, but for all my lighter incline/decline work this should do the job just fine.",

It arrived quickly and went together quite easily and quickly. Instructions say 2 people required for assembly. But that's not true at all. I was however glad to have my socket set with ratchet handle to assemble the lock nuts for the base and the hex screws for the bench. Instructions said all you need is an adjustable wrench, but this would have been a real pain in the arse to assemble with that tool. It's a great bench for the price. Perfect for my home gym in living room. I also bought the OneTwoFit Doorway Pull Up Bar no Screws at same time. Shown in this picture in the doorway . Requires no mounting hardware, pressure fit, easy to install.",
