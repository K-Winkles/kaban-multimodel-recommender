                "reviewText": "I had my hopes too high. I paid $10.80 for this before tax. It is not worth that. It's balsawood so lightweight. Assembly was easy although a part that goes in the leg screw came off while tightening it to the shelf and since the wood is so flimsy I'm afraid to pry it off using any force so I left it not screwed in. Could probably use super glue to fix that if I wasn't returning it. The legs are also bowed because the holes and screws don't quite align. It is fine for shoes but I wouldn't trust anything heavier on it. How some people have pics of pots and pans on them is beyond me. I have 3 pairs of shoes on the top but the 1 pair just barely; the last shoe hangs off a little (I wear a woman's 10). I think it would work fine for kid shoes or smaller shoes. It's the perfect size for where I want to keep it. Also pictured is a defect on the bottom shelf. This didn't happen in shipping as the missing piece wasn't in the wrapper. I had planned to paint it to match my decor although the natural look isn't bad if that floats your boat. All in all, I'm disappointed and returning it. Pay more money and get you something better!",

A little bit, yes. Is it cheap, thin wood? Yes. But it works perfectly for my intention-- it's holding outdoor work shoes in my garage. You simply can't beat the value for the price. And by the way, they shipped this in a box that could fit a large framed painting... This was shocking to me, as this type of box would cost more than the shelf in a shipping store.",
