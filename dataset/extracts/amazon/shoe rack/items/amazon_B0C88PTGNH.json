It does look like wood, but they picked an ugly piece of wood to duplicate with the veneer they put on top of the particle board. It looks like an old stained piece of oak. The color isn\u2019t bad, just the grain pattern and blotches. I was thinking \u201cRustic Brown\u201d meant color. They mean \u201crustic\u201d as in old & used.
