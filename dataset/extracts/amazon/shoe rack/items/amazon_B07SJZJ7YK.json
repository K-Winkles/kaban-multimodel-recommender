                "reviewText": "It was super easy to assemble. The instructions are easy to read. ALL the parts are clearly labeled. Even the screws/bolts were in labeled bags. It comes with a few spare bolts and those are clearly labeled \"spare\" on the bag. All I needed was an Allen wrench which was supplied in a bag with the bolts. Probably one of the easiest pieces of furniture I have ever put together. There are adjusters for the feet to make it level and it was so easy. It was way easier to get all the lower shelves' bolts halfway started and wait to tighten them all till everything was assembled.I love this! I put this in my front entry. It is pretty tall, so I do not have to lean over to put anything on top. The lower shelves are sturdy enough to obviously put shoes on, but I would not put anything heavy on them. I was going to only put 2 or 3 lower shelves and put a plant on the lower shelves but the mesh kind of sagged with the weight(20lbs approx), so I decided against it. My plants sit beautifully on the top shelf though.",

                "reviewText": "Have purchased 2 of these exact racks now. They are really nice shoe racks. Love the fact we had different color wood options for the top shelf, we have one in our breezeway that honestly is used more as a multipurpose rack ( shoes underneath, dog biscuits, kids book bags, and stuff we need to grab quick on our way out the door on top) it holds a lot of weight without faltering. The lower shelves are made of a wire mesh ( I guess this is good and bad feature .. water/ dirt wont sit on the shelf BUTTT will go through to the next one on another pair of shoes below) also lower shelves have slight indents so not everything just slides right off and the edges on the sides of each rack are slightly raised also just enough to avoid sliding . I do think there may have been some improvements made to the assembly, the last one we purchased about 8 months ago for my son's room and it took 2 of us to put together. This one was easy breezy, took about 45 minutes solo from unboxing. Holes lined up, all the hardware was there and the instructions were simple. If at some point I have the need for another one would buy this exact version again.",

I personally would buy again and use this in other areas of my home or office for other things then in the entry way for shoes. Also quick and easy to assemble!!",
