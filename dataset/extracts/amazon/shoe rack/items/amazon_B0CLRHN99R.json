                "reviewText": "This is great! It took maybe 5 minutes to put together. I love that it's so big! I have this smaller gray one at the front door to have quick access to them, or to leave whatever nature decides to give you at the door. And I really like it, so when I found this one - with two levels instead of just one - I decided to get it and try it out. I'm SO happy I did. But I wasn't at first. When it first arrived, I held the length of fabric to compare with the gray one I have, and it was MUCH longer. More space for more shoes, but it wouldn't fit where I had wanted to put it. I honestly wasn't sure it would fit in my closet. But it DID! I had some scrappy plastic one, and I decided to remove that one and replace it with this one, and it works! It has PLENTY of room for shoes, and by building the bottom shelf up off the ground, it's like 3 tiers for shoes!! If you need one similar to this, GET THIS!",

You could fit 3 pairs of adult shoes on each tier and then an additional 3 pairs underneath the last tier (12 pairs in all).I really like the polyester fabric on this, as opposed to the non-woven fabric that many other shoe racks have in this price range. I definitely was able to tell the difference right off the bat. The polyester fabric feels a lot more durable and very similar to oxford fabric.Mine did have some sharp bits in some of the screw holes, so please be wary of that when assembling.",
