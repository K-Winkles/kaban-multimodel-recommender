Yes, one tube may not fit perfectly, but you make it fit. Plastic is not too hard to reshape. The rack is as strong as it is expected. Just tap it well on the sides and it will be sturdy enough to support your shoes. If you wear sides 10 1/2 to 13, do not get this product. Your shoes will be too big and too heavier for the rack. I wear 9 1/2 size and it is perfect. The quality is not top notch, but it is enough for my laundry room.",
