The common problem when I assemble racks made of metal bars and plastic joints is that the plastic parts are often very fragile and break easily when I insert the poles. But this one is made with good quality. I bought two of these racks, and no parts broke during the assembling process. Great choice to make use of space at the bottom of the closet!",

I would also recommend assembling with a rubber mallet to make sure that the bars stay secure. However, it's very flimsy, and the bars kept falling out while I was trying to put shoes on it. For the price it's okay, but it definitely wasn't designed for heavy use. I think that if I wasn't using this in my closet for shoe storage, it would absolutely break on me in a couple of months. That being said, it works for my needs, and the bars stopped falling once I hammered the ends a little more.",

I put it up against a wall which stabilized it. It fits 4 pairs plus one single shoe on each level. I would definitely buy another of these.",
