They don\u2019t fit in standard shoe racks so the fact that you can take out the middle piping lets them stand up tall is IDEAL. I put one pipe in the middle long ways on those shelves I took out to help with stability and it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the boots, so it\u2019s a win win. I have 6 pairs of tall boots and four pairs of short ones on here. It\u2019s sturdy enough in a corner and fits in the space behind my door almost perfectly. Soooo practical and I\u2019m already obsessed. Glad to have my boots off the floor. This is probably the best $20 I\u2019ve ever spent on anything before. Will be telling ALL my friends about this.",
