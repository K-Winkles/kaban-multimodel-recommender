                "reviewText": "This shoe storage rack is perfect for those with little space! It was somewhat easy to put together just make sure to follow directions step by step. I did have to look on the box several times to figure out what goes where but I done it myself with no help needed. This really came in handy for me as I live in a small apartment but needed a place to put my shoes so my dog doesn\u2019t get them. The material is sturdy and does last long I have sometimes put more than one pair of shoe in a slot. I like that it allows you to customize the slots if you need more room or not for instance for a boot you may need more. It is super easy to clean if you get mud or dirt on it. I highly recommend this for anyone!",

For the longest time, I was wondering where woybe the best place to store my shoes, having a tiny space around the entryway. I am able to find space for this shoerack without getting in the way of anything, no obstruction in front of closet doors, bathroom doors. Plus it's easy to assemble, great value for the money, pretty durable and should be very easy to clean. I'm just happy that I can put guest slippers on the top. If I have friends come over, they can just take one pair of slippers from the rack instead of me opening the closet door every time I have a visitor.",
