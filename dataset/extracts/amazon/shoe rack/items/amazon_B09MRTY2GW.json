This is exactly what I needed for my husband's closet to store some extra shoes, without taking up too much space. What I like is this shelf is wide enough for his big shoes! (Size 14). It fits comfortably 6-7 pairs of men's shoes. I recommend this product. Just pay attention to dimensions and use a measuring tape to decide if this is right fit for you.",
