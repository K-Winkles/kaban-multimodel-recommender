Every piece was carefully labeled and the instructions were accurate and fairly easy to follow. I needed a shoe rack with a small profile and this one was perfect for my space. This product exceeded my expectations!!",

                "reviewText": "It arrived in many pieces but the detailed instructions were clear and all the parts needed were there. It is very well constructed once I put it together. It has extra dowrl in it to increase stability and every screw needed to assemble. Clear instructions. one drawback was I had to use the Allen wrench that came with it and that is time consuming and hurts your fingers after a while. But the end result I'm very pleased with and it fits behind my front door and holds several pairs of sandals and a few pair of my husband's bigger shoes. I gave it 5 instead of 6 because of the assembly I had to do",

Although it is a little tough to put together, have patience, it works great.
