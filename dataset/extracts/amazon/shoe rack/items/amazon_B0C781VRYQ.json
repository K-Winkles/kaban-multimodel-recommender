I was able to make shift it to work with tape and chopsticks for the last 3 months, but at this point I cannot stand it. this thing has caused me two mental breakdowns. The poles across the rack have snapped so they are barely hold my shows now which sucks. But my main problem is that pole are not long enough or there is no way to attach the poles into the corner pieces in a sturdy way so they constantly fall out. You pull the pole into one hole and it falls out the other. DO NOT BUY!! MINE IS DEFECTED OR THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!!!",
