Overall the assembly is straight forward, but I noticed one issue that can cause potential frustration for those that are not familiar with assembling mass produced products like this. Once you have a bolt threaded in one side of a leg piece you may need to force the opposite leg a little one way or the other to get the holes aligned. It\u2019s a bit annoying, and in my case wasn\u2019t a major issue, but it adds some difficulty during assembly. Once you get the bolt threads engaged properly then they screw in easily and hold everything quite well. The allen wrench (or hex key) that is included is small but It will get the job done. But assembly is much easier with a larger and more efficient tool. I have a set of hex key \u215c\u201d sockets that made assembly much faster.",

I bought 5 two tier which are really three levels if you count putting shoes on the floor under the racks. Easy assembly- I barely looked at the directions. I like the handles on each side in case I need to slide the racks out. And they are very light weight-not heavy at all.",
