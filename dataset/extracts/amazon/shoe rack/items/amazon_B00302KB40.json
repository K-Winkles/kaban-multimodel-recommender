                "reviewText": "I'm so glad I ordered this bamboo rack! After reading all the negative comments about cheaper shoe racks easily falling apart, I went for the extra ten bucks and chose the Honey-Can-Do, and skipped all those regrets. It was just delivered about an hour ago and I've already got it standing in my closet, loaded with shoes. Easy-peasy! It's adorable! And clean-looking, accurately fabricated (holes are in the right places, all the screws included, no splinters), and sturdy. After I read the instructions a few times, and realized there are alternative ways to put this together, I made my decision and easily assembled it with the Allen wrench enclosed in the box. Despite the title of my review, I'm not a girl ... I am an 80 year old woman, with arthritis and strong determination. I would buy this one again in a heartbeat!",

                "reviewText": "First, yes this is made from bamboo but it is not very strong. Unlike Bamboo flooring this is not that strong (but its not suppose to be).Instructions are missing some pieces like which direction to point the dongles to stack multiple of these together.The dongle for stacking is GLUED IN which is nutz because what if you do not want to stack. It looks awful with this sticking at the top and strange if it is standing on it.If you have it on a non-carpet floor it will slide all over the place. Use a anti slide rubber sticky on it (solves the problem).Honestly, I love the rack! It looks nice and does the job. Just be aware of the things I pointed out and you will not have any issues.",
