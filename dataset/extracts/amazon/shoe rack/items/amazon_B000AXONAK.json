I don't have that problem because I turn the rack backwards (heels of shoes facing outward) and it's up against the closet wall.Perfect for me and a great value...I highly recommend!",

I am using them for heels, so they work great. As other reviewers have mentioned, these racks are for heeled shoes. I read another review that said she just turned hers so it faces the other direction for un-heeled shoes and the shoes butt up against the wall. Makes sense to me! As I was aware that they were for heeled shoes and that's what I wanted, I would definitely recommend this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly consisted only of tightening four screws and took just a couple minutes. The rack is expandable so you don't waste any space in your closet. The rear bar is higher than the front one, so obviously it's meant for shoes with a heel to catch, but apparently it's not that obvious to one of the people who gave this item a bad rating. Any shoe with even the slightest heel will sit just perfectly on it and it looks very clean in my closet! I'm so happy with it I want to buy a second but I have nowhere to put it... maybe it's a gift.",

                "reviewText": "My shoes have been filling out my current two tier rack and over the door in my closet for some time now; I got this as an addition to stack on top of the two.The two that I currently have were bought well over 10-12 years ago and clearly they've upped their game since then. This one is very well made, sturdy and easy to assemble. The metal rods are thicker, making stacking with my current racks from yesteryear.....difficult to say the least.Luckily I'm a thinker and had some wooden dowels on hand. Cut them into 6 icy pieces and hot glued them into the hollows of the metal rods so that way my older tier could fit snuggly and not all loose and wobbly.I'd still purchase again, even with having to MacGyver it.",
