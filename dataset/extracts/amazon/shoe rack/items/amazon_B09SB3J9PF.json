Putting this together was tedious but not difficult at all, there is a lot of small bars that they give you the cutest little mallet to make sure it\u2019s tightly secure into place. This shoe rack was pretty sturdy no issues the first 6-7 months but since august pieces keep pushing out and have to be put back in and falling out as well. So many of the pieces have bent that they don\u2019t stay in or hold any weight that those shoe cubbies are useless. Last night the entire shoe rack fell down with all the shoes and items on it, and I will not be putting it back together. Period. It really was such a good idea and it looked so neat and sturdy, I do have children that use the shoe rack as well so with that being said this purchase may be better suited for homes without kiddos lol I say that only because my eleven year old with just kinda shove her shoes in her cubbies and that is were the bars originally started popping out and went bad from there.",
