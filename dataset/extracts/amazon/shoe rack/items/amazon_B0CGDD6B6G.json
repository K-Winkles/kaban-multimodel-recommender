It is an average quality shoe rack that you can assemble to fit your needs a few different ways. It takes a little bit of time to put it together because there are so many pieces, and you need to make sure the connector pieces are facing the right way or you may have to take it apart like I had to. It's not the most heavy duty rack at all. It does the job, but it's not going to be able to tolerate a bunch of weight or anyone running into it such as animals or children. The listing does claim to be able to support 100 lbs, but I still wouldn't push it. The base for the shoes is just a piece of fabric that you slide the poles through. Heels with narrow heels don't stand up well as the base isn't study enough. That fabric attracts hair and fur, but it is easy to just blow it off with your mouth. Lol. It's just an average quality, simple shoe rack to get some better organization going. I did order a 10-tier rack just like this that is the same exact concept and great for my heels. I do appreciate the options to change it up instead of it having to be one way completely if you have certain items you need more space for or just for it to fit in a certain space.",

                "reviewText": "This shoe rack was the easiest thing to assemble, and feels fairly sturdy for a shoe rack. It holds a lot of shoes plus boots and keeps it looking so nice and organized. The shelves have a cloth like feel to them but are made of some kind of coated product that is very sturdy, holds up to dozen pairs of shoes quite easily. I had a very small plastic coated metal triple rack that kept track of all the shoes and it looked quite cheap. This one doesn\u2019t look cheap and it is a whole lot taller than the previous one but it truly looks a lot nicer in my entryway. The plastic connectors are a durable plastic and the metal rods fit in them perfectly. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it as a good purchase. I did have to rearrange the things on that wall as the rack is very wide. My son ask me if \u201cI had measured the space\u201d well of course not, why would I do that. LOL",

                "reviewText": "This shoe stand was easy to assemble (took me 40 minutes or less but it was smooth sailing). When assembling, you make five long shelves and three short shelves and then stack them. You can speed up the process by grouping materials to create an assembly line of sorts. Even without doing that, everything is so well labeled, it is pretty simple.I was concerned that this would be flimsy but am really impressed with how solid it is. The shelves are not quite wide enough for two pairs of men\u2019s shoes or boots. That\u2019s my only complaint. Two pairs of women\u2019s and kids shoes fit easily.I omitted one shelf to make it shorter to fit in my space. I love that it can be switched around without a lot of trouble!",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty nice shoe rack. I like that you can kinda move around the double height spots to your liking (I also like that is has those taller spots because my partner has a lot boots). The assembly was pretty easy, I did mess up right I. The beginning and had to disassemble and reassemble it correctly, the instructions aren\u2019t super clear tbh. It feels pretty sturdy once all put together, but I would recommend putting you heavier shoes on the bottom, or to somehow anchor it to the wall, but that\u2019s really more of an issue of height to footprint ratio, not any fault of the product itself. All in all I\u2019d for sure recommend getting it.",
