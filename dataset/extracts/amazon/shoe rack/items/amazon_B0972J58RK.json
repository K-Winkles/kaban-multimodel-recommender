This shoes rack is small enough to fit under there perfectly. It's stackable so I basically only used two of the possible 4 shelves in the set for this space. I'll use the other two shelves elsewhere. The ends are a thick plastic and the bars are hollow metal. It feels like it wouldn't be able to hold a lot of weight (like if an adult sat/stepped on it), but for the job of holding shoes on it, it's perfect. It took me less than 5 minutes to put it together. A simple contraption for a simple job that won't break the bank. 10/10",
