There are little welding notches on one side so put them down. It was easy to assemble. It took me less than an hour. It\u2019s pretty sturdy but it may tip if it\u2019s not against a wall if it\u2019s on carpet. I didn\u2019t use the wall strap and it\u2019s fine in the corner. I had limited space and this fit well. It replaced the round shoe rack and looks so much nicer. I can see all of my shoes now. I am able to get 40 pairs on the rack by doubling up the sandals and flip flops where possible. I also added a small basket for my belts (after these pics). I researched a lot of shelves and I\u2019m so glad I got this one. It\u2019s perfect!",

I bought one and when I realized it will not fit all our shoes there was no turning back and just bought a second one. It\u2019s a bit wobbly, a bit tedious to put together (make sure you have a drill!), and some of the metal shelves looked a bit bent which I bent back into place to make it even. Also make sure when you anchor this to the wall you put the anchor in the inside of the shelves.The pros: flexibility on where the shelving goes, the top wooden shelf is nice, all the pieces are uniform so it\u2019s hard to mess up installation.If this was $80 or so I\u2019d give it 5 stars but for $120 I was not super satisfied.",

Honestly, it\u2019s too expensive for a shoe rack, if I wasn\u2019t desperate to get one, I would not pay this much. But now for the pros of it, The top shelf gives a modern and sleek look to the stand. I got the 10 level rack and it fits about 4-5 pairs of shoes on every rack. It\u2019s not narrow, which allows room for some winter boots to be placed in. It\u2019s a narrow tall shelf which saves me so much space in my small storage/laundry room. I live in a small condo, so anything that helps conserve space is a win! The only downside is that it\u2019s not sturdy enough without being screwed down to the wall. Even before putting any shoes or anything on the racks, it was wobbly and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable putting any weight on it before stabilizing it. Overall, it looks nice and it\u2019s shelves are sturdy being metal, and carry well. I suggest this!",
