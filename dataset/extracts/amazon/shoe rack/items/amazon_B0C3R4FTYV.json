                "reviewText": "I wanted a rack that could hold LOTS of shoes, and studied quite a few offerings before settling on this one. The 5 shelves give plenty of space, plus there is room underneath for another row of shoes. The overall size is great -- not too big and not too small. I like that it just sits there doing its job without being a focal point in any way. (After all, who needs to draw attention to their giant pile of shoes at the door?) It is lightweight wood, so there's no climbing on it... but it's perfect for my purposes.",

                "reviewText": "This is a sturdy, nice looking 2 rack shelf. The folding shelf is a good idea and makes for a strong joint. when it is opened up. But the leg screw holes weren't properly aligned in some areas and most were too shallow to get the screws in all the way with the tiny tool provided. I did not have any screwdriver tips that would fit (and they are not hex screws either).So, I could return it, re-drill the holes that weren't right and were too shallow, or use my own screws so I could use my drill to power them into the existing holes. I liked the look of the piece so I opted to do the last option and it worked out fine.I took off a star in my rating because of the poor quality control, but only one because I could do a simple work around.",
