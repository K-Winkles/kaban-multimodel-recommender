I originally ordered it for shoes, but when it arrived and we put it together, I decided to turn it into a storage rack since it is so strong and durable. As you can see in the photos, I placed three heavy containers on it and it did not even buckle. I have a heavy tool kit on the bottle and just have not decided what to put in the middle \u2013 but I am certain it will hold it. This is a great rack with heavy canvas and it looks good! It\u2019s not cheaply made and was super easy to put together. Directions are very easy. Highly recommend this for shoes or storage!",

In the pictures top row is 3 pairs of 10.5 women's shoes. Middle row 2 pairs of men's size 12 tennis shoes. No real room for another pair of anything there. And if you pay attention to the advert pic and compare to the attached pics, again, no real room for shoes unless flats, flip flops not as they show in picture.Will I use it? Sure. Am I satisfied? As far as holding shoes, yes. As far as it being as advertised, not completely. If you're ok with that, get it for yourself as well. If you would rather have a product exactly as advertised, keep looking.",
