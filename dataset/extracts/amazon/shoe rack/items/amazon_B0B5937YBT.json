Holds about five men's shoes. Six lady shoes or children shoes. I also have two youth jackets hanging on it. Great for next to the kitchen door and has slim profile",

Once assembled the unit is steady and holds about 2.5 pairs of shoes per shelf - so about 10 pairs of shoes in total for me.I really like the mesh shelving as they allow full air movements around the shoes top, sides and bottom.Materials are sturdy and color blends well into most any color scheme. However, I would have liked the screws to be black as well.",

No picture of finished product to go by, difficult to assemble. I usually don't have an issue putting things together. I wanted a narrow shoe rack for entryway. This was a good size. The description said 'mesh' The website photo made it look like wire mesh. It is cloth mesh, quite flimsy. Will not work for me, I will be returning.",
