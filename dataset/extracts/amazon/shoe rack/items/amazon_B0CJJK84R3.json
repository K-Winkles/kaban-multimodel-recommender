It came in a very small lightweight box and it was pretty easy to assemble. Not only that but it holds a lot shoes and the option to keep it open or closed it cool also. The 2nd pic shows that it has (7) shelves that can hold about 4 pairs of sneakers and has a bottom shelf that has drawers to keep stuff in and has side pocket storage!!Definitely recommend this product!!!",

I used duck tape to try and hold it together and that did help for to long. The bars are dented in. As well as getting anything other then sneakers, flats, or sandals is hard because the tiers are so close together. I\u2019m giving 3 starts because I put 8 more pairs of shoes that wasn\u2019t recommended so that\u2019s on me. I think this would a good for kids shoes or maybe a male who doesn\u2019t wear anything high top",
