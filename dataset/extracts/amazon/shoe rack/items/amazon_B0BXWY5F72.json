I have it by my front door and it\u2019s still really great bc it doesn\u2019t block my door way or even the door from opening all the way. It definitely holds a decent amount of shoes which is great.",

Very well balanced and holds 25lbs of filters and water just fine. Well made and sturdy. If they can hold our water filters they can certainly hold your shoes. It looks nice also.",

                "reviewText": "I have a lot of shoes and several different racks for them, in addition to the one built into my closet. I bought this rack for some casual shoes I could store in the space under under the clothes rod for my slacks. There is basically no intallation--you just slide one side into the other, and it is easily expandable to fit your space. There is enough room under it to fit flip flops or other thin shoes, and as it is, it is very easy to vacuum or sweep under.",

The rack was very sturdy for me, but keep in mind I only need to open it wide enough to fit 9 pairs of shoes, 3 pairs on each row. I can imagine that if you extend it to its widest range you may say differently, but for my purposes I am happy.",
