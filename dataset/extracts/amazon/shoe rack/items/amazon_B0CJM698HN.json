                "reviewText": "Let's start with the only 2 negatives I have; first, the picture is deceiving because I definitely expected it to be a drawer not a flip top compartment, kind of annoying since I want to put cute things up there like a candle and a plant but I'll get over it... The second negative which is more a WORD OF CAUTION!: the the phillips part of the screws strips pretty easy, so when screwing this together apply good solid even pressure and take your time. If you don't you may strip the screw and be in for some trouble completing assembly. The package did come with a few pieces of extra equipment/hardware just incase you lose a screw. It advertised as a 15 pair shoe rack and but I got over 20 on there by stacking the flip flops and alternating toe facing in and toe facing out for every other pair. I bought 2 of these because apparently we have well over 30 pairs of shoes. Not good for tall shoes or boots. I bought this one because it appealed to me aesthetically as more of a piece of furniture rather then a grungy looking shoe rack.",

                "reviewText": "Exactly what I wanted! Top is not a drawer like others mentioned, but has soft close hinges so it doesn't slam shut. I put hat and gloves in the top. Took me about 40 mins to assemble with no issues, just make sure and use small screws for top. I used an electric screw gun for all of it except top, I think that sped up assemble time. Shelves are small so if you have really big feet you might have a harder time fitting shoes, I wear a womens 6 for reference. Worked perfect for my needs.",

It didn\u2019t work out for my heels, most of which are in the 3.5-4\u201d range, so that was a bummer but it\u2019s probably in the dimensions and I didn\u2019t take note.",
