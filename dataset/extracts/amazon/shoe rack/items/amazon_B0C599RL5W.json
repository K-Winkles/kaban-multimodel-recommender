Didn\u2019t really want plastic, but since I live where it snows plastic made the most sense to me. Set up was literally a snap, took like 5 seconds to pop it up. I do like the size and how it folds up- I live in a tiny apartment,and when I move it won\u2019t take up much space to pack away.The only con I can come up with is that it\u2019s wobbly. But in my opinion, the pros outweigh the con, so it\u2019s a win. For the price, it can\u2019t be beat.It doesn\u2019t exactly fit my aesthetic, but it was exactly what I needed.",

I love the look and ease of this shoe rack. it pops up and goes back down easily. it is very easy to move to dust and sweep around. I will admit, I thought $15 was a little steep for what it is. I still love it, and I would purchase again. however I thought along the lines of $12.99 would have been a perfect price for this product. however, I do suggest it for small spaces...pulling together lingering pairs of shoes, it is perfect for that. a small negative: I would be careful when popping it up and pushing it back down. it's a nice product, but being abrasive with it, could snap one of the legs on it. you can't toss it and throw it around and expect it to remain intact.",

Works great. Not all my shoes fit perfectly inside and they slightly hang out, and my boots have to be on top, but it doesn't matter. Perfect for what I needed.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to help organize shoes for our 5 member family. We have a smaller closet space to work with and shoes seem to pile up everywhere. I do love the shoe-tower approach to get more out of a smaller base footprint. I do also like that it can collapse for storage or travel. The one issue we run into is that our large dog will bump it and push the collapsible side in. The tower tilts and then spills the shoes on top. Its not a huge deal and if you don't have a clumsy dog and 3 toddlers pushing the side in, your fine. It easily fits a mens size 12 without overhang. I can fit 3 pairs of toddler shoes on each level (minus the top). Over all I am happy with this item.",
