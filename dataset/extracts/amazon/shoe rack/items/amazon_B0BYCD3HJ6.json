It is very lightweight and still oddly extremely sturdy despite that. It arrived with an off number of posts to outside pieces and lousy instructions so not sure what happened there but it went together so easily and it\u2019s buildable so it\u2019s easy to change its shape or add on etc. very happy with it, totally cleaned up the shoe clutter in my garage- 7 of us live here, so I\u2019ll be buying another one!",
