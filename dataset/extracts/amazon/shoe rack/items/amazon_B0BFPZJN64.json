No parts were missing, and an extra screw was even included, just in case . . . The finished product is sturdy but not heavy, and it holds 18 pairs of shoes if you count the space between the floor and the first shelf. (The space between the floor and first shelf is best used for flats or low shoes only. High heels and/or boots fit fine on the two shelves.)",
