                "reviewText": "Overall, the shoe rack meets my needs and the price was fair. Assembly was not too bad, but I would recommend waiting to tighten any one fastener until all of them are loosely assembled.What the pictures do not show is that the flat portion the shoes sit on, is actually two pieces hinged in the middle. I understand this makes it a lot more shipping friendly, but the alignment of the hinges is less than perfect. This causes the 'flat' portions to really not quite be flat, and the entire assembly to warp a bit when you fold it flat. You can tell one hinge is happier than the other etc. and the whole thing seems to be fighting itself under some kind of tension when assembled, and is not quite flat.I have to knock off a couple of stars, because the execution on the hinge design is not good enough to give them a pass on using factually wrong photos that clearly show a continuous single piece shelf, which is not what I got with the dark colored two-tier model.",

                "reviewText": "The RONGJIA 3-Tier Natural Bamboo Shoe Rack is the Jenga of shoe organizers \u2013 stackable, versatile, and ready to play the storage game. Holding a respectable number of shoes, this rack allows you to fold each section.The multi-function combinations are like shoe Tetris; you can either make it larger by stacking more or separate it into sections to make it a shoe microcosm. It's the Lego of shoe racks, and your shoes are the building blocks.Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room: the material. The bamboo gives it that natural, eco-friendly vibe, but let's not kid ourselves \u2013 it looks a bit on the cheap side. It's like the fast fashion of shoe racks. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the quality, but I'm crossing my fingers and hoping it holds up better than my last pair of sneakers.In the grand scheme of shoe storage, the RONGJIA Bamboo Shoe Rack is like the Swiss Army knife \u2013 it does the job, has some cool tricks up its sleeve, but the jury's still out on long-term durability. If you're looking for a budget-friendly, customizable shoe storage solution and aren't planning to put it through a stress test, give it a shot. It's the shoe rack that's reaching for the stars, one stack at a time",
