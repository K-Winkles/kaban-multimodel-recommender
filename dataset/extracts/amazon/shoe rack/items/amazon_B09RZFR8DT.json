                "reviewText": "I've got big feet because I'm a man so if you're a size 11.5-12, don't expect to fit more then 2 pair of shoes and a pair of flip flops, if stored properly, on each level. Not a complaint by any means though. Looks very nice, solid material, very easy and quick to assemble, light as a feather, and doesn't take up much space at all. Highly recommend if you need a little organization and a place to put your shoes instead of on the floor.",
