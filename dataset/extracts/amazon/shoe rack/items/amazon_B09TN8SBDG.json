It's small, but it should be able to fit 8 pairs of thicker shoes (such as sneakers or boots) up to 16 pairs of thinner shoes like slides and sandals (if you stack the sandals on top of each other like I do). The \"shelf\" is a thin plasticky material but once put together and taught it seems durable; just don't put any shoes with spikes (such as for snow) and don't use too much force to stack like cleats or it could tear. If your careful not to rip that material when putting it together, it's a piece of cake. Looks like it'll also be easy to clean. I recommend! Added: forgot to mention that it came with an extra support rod, it has the option on each shelf for extra support rods under the material, and that it has holes on the top side of all shelf connectors so that you could get another shelf and stack it!",
