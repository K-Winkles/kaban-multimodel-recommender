                "reviewText": "This is a no-frills, hanging shoe organizer. It's not fancy, but plenty useful. It is, after all, from the 'Amazon Basics' line.The mesh that's used for the shoe pockets isn't heavy duty, but it's strong enough. As long as it's not abused, it'll last.It's under $9, so don't expect it to last forever, but you definitely will get much, much more usage and convenience value from this than $9.Realistically, men's size 9W, maybe 10W, is about the largest size that would fit each pocket comfortably. Larger shoes may not \"drop\" into the pouches; you may need to give them a helping hand and coax them into the pouches. (The organizer's design is for shoes to be inserted toe-end down.)If you drop two pairs of men's 9W tennis shoes in a 4-across row of pockets, you'll need to pull the mesh over the shoes in the row below to get them to seat fully in the pouch. You won't be able to \"drop\" the shoes in the pockets below because the volume/bulk of the front (toe) of the shoes in the pockets above will interfere. You need to pull the back (heel end) of the shoe toward you and get it off the toe of the shoe above, then push it into the pocket as you pull over the mesh.For women and children, since the shoes are smaller, narrower, and less bulky, there shouldn't be any difficulty getting them to \"drop\" in.The supplied hooks are okay for light to medium duty, but I would be reluctant to load the 24 pouches with 12 pairs of heavy, leather shoes. Basically, these hooks are 5/16\" strips of sheet metal bent into shape, and I don't believe they have a high-enough yield strength/stress to withstand deformation from the load. Over time, the hook could bend (actually straighten) from the weight.This thing will help you declutter and organize your shoes to reclaim floor space from your closet, entry area, patio, garage, etc.Don't just limit its use to shoes. After you realize its utility for organizing, you'll probably end up buying more for other STUFF.You definitely will get your money's worth, and then some...",
