It sits below our fridge, by a large air vent, and because it so open, does not affect the vent.",

It's so much easier for me in keeping that space cleaner and organized. We aren't tripping over shoes anymore. It keeps the whole RV cleaner as the shoes have a place to stay when we come in. It is also very sturdy and easily adjustable for where ever we decide to put it. I just simply pull on one side and it slides open for more space. I love that it is perfect for my space. LOVE LOVE LOVE",

We got creative with some of our slides/slippers storing sideways or stacked on one another, so it really can hold a good amount of shoes (even just the two tiered one we got). Besides the expanding feature, I chose this one for the depth- it was intended for a space behind the front door and we still wanted the door to open as much as possible, and it\u2019s perfect for the spot! Really cleaned up the shoe mess that despite my best efforts to maintain the shoes just seem to always pile up. At least this is more pleasing to the eye lol",
