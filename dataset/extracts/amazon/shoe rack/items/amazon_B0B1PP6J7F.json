I assembled it in about an hour with the \u2018help\u2019 of my 1.5 & 3yr old (don\u2019t recommend). There are a lot of screws (making it very sturdy) and I definitely recommend using an electric screwdriver or drill. There are pilot holes pre drilled and everything lined up with still needed a good amount of muscle to put together and I ended up with a blister because I was using a standard screw driver. All exposed screws are counter sunk and small wood grain stickers are provided to cover the screws, I opted not to put them on because my kids will just pick them off.My only complaints are the brackets for the side pieces aren\u2019t the most attractive and the door is low quality vs the rest of the piece. I was surprised to find that it was a material drawers and not made of the same wood material as everything else, even the drawer front is a much thinner wood material than everything else giving it a much cheaper feel. Having said that overall it is a great piece and I\u2019m glad I decided to go with a slightly higher price item.",
