Most shoe racks are 70cm or 100>.Minus one star - designed for adult shoes I suppose so shoes rest on two lonely rods (top and bottom). Space between the rods is too big for toddler shoes (US7). Would be nice if they could add something in that space so as to fit children shoes.Minus one star -too expensive for such a simple design, and basic mats. - all of which would be fine if the price was much less.",
