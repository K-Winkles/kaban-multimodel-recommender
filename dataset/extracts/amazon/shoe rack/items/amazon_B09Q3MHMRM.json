                "reviewText": "This shelf is very lightweight, and if fits in tight spaces - only a foot wide. I was able to partition it into 3 sections - a 3-level shelf for shoes (with no bottom plate), and two 2-level shelves for hats, etc. One of those is also with no bottom plate, but good enough as the wrapper canvas adds stability.I like the precise workmanship - everything fits well, fairly tight, so it won't fall apart if carried or held with some moderate weight in it. It looks decent too.I was able to fit two pairs of shoes into each slot, if placed 69 for each pair.Overall, I am pretty happy with this. Time will tell how well it holds.Assembly tips:It will take you at least 40 min to assemble.- Get a leather or marine or other tough glove for quicker and safe assembly.- I'd suggest putting tubes into all the canvas sleeves first - you'll be doing it much faster by the end, and save time on sliding the canvas, as it's more difficult to do when tight. Then insert the tubes in sleeves first and after that the free tubes (one side).- Pair the left and right holders in advance and set them all in the right direction, to avoid mixing up/down accidentally.",

Can be worth for price but I would buy something more expensive rather than spending my time and nerve .",

Took me 1 hour to put it together. Also. The quality of the metal pieces are cheap so when connecting them if you don\u2019t connect them right or hammer them too hard you will change the shape of the metal and it won\u2019t fit into the hole.",

I admittedly have a large foot (women\u2019s size 12), and most racks are too narrow and too short. This shoe rack is sturdy, stable and roomy. Easy to assemble and unobtrusive in the corner of the room. Will definitely buy another one for my mom.",
