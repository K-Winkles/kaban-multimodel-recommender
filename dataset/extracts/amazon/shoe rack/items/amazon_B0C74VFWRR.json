I contacted the return assistant on Amazon and requested a replacemnt.The other day it arrived and I sent the first one back two days after.They said I never sent it back and charged me for both.Beside: it\u2019s a terrible quality, I just kept it because it\u2019s inside my closet and hidden. If I knew I was going to be charged twice for a very poor product that I even don\u2019t have the second one, I would never buy it.So it\u2019s not worth the price (yes, $8 is too much for this) neither who is behind the scenes charging for what was returned.",
