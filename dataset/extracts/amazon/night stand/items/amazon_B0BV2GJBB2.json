It does not look like junk as some lightweight cheaper furniture often is. We needed a table that would fit perfectly next to my father's bathroom sink at the Senior Living Retirement home, because his apartment bathroom has small spaces and virtually no storage or counter top to place his regular items like dentures and toothbrush, etcThe two flat shelves plus two drawers were exactly what was needed! The imitation woodgrain and colors of brown are very visually attractive as well. Overall, a great buy!",

Screwdrivers are pretty common tools that are usually purchased and kept so that\u2019s probably why it is not provided as I see some people complaining about that. All the rest of the tools are there. You only need the screwdriver to install the handlebars on the fabric drawers.It\u2019s freaking beautiful. The fabric drawers (usually don\u2019t like) have a nice wood-looking design on it so I really like it. The only issue I had was one of the drawers holes didn\u2019t line up with the handlebar, so will be reaching out about that. Everything else perfect. Looks just how I wanted it!",

The directions list specified tools included within the kit, except they don\u2019t fit the hardware. I came to stop on the second step because there is no way to turn the assigned screw into place. I\u2019m unfamiliar with the shape of the head but nothing in this kit turns the screw(s). I\u2019m not unskilled when it comes to putting things of this sort together. I have nothing in my arsenal of mix and match tools that fit either. It was a waste of time and I\u2019m really disappointed. Already tossed out the box so I guess I\u2019m gonna toss out the rest as well.Edit: I purchased my own screws to assemble. I stand by the fact that the tools and materials provided are rubbish.AND, this is a product review and in no way reflects the seller.",
