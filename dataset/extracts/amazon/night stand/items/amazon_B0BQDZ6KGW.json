He loved that. It was actually pretty easy to put together, it took two of us. One of them was a child to help, the wood grain looks pretty good. You can tell it\u2019s not the real wood grain but it\u2019s nice seems to be of good quality.",

                "reviewText": "I was so excited when I ordered this because I struggle to make my way through the dark at night and in early morning. Super upset because the induction light just does *NOT* work. I\u2019ve tried it all the ways. Hooking up to the different cords, etc. I tried sitting and waiting endlessly to see if I was just missing it turn off, or if it was overly sensitive, but it never did. Not with the lights off, on, cord hookups changed, with the lights dimmed, changing preferred settings and waiting. Resetting by unplugging and waiting. Nothing works. Turning the induction setting off or on doesn\u2019t even work. You literally can\u2019t turn it on without the lights being on either. The touchpad won\u2019t allow it. It just will not turn off at all. Which is great, in theory, but I could\u2019ve bought a nightlight for much cheaper and had the desired motion sense effect without the hassle. I am disabled sadly, so taking apart and returning or replacing would be more hassle than it would benefit myself. I wish with everything that this actually worked because I was extremely excited to receive this bedside table. I tried giving it the benefit of the doubt after reading only a handful of negative reviews, and honestly I wish I hadn\u2019t wasted my time or my fixed income.",
