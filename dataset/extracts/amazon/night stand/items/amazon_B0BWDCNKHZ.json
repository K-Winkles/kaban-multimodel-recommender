The instructions should be improved, not detailed at all. Luckily this night stand is very easy to assemble so we are able to figure everything out on our own. One thing I don\u2019t like much is sometimes when I pull out the drawer, the whole night stand moves forward and I find myself having to stabilize the nightstand with my other hand.
