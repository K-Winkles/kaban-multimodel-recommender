My only complaint is that the grating on the bottom is not entirely welded to the sides. It's enough to hold some weight on it but those points are really sharp. I didn't really think much about it while unpacking all the pieces. It wasn't until I cut myself while assembling that I worried about it being an issue for my pets that would be around them. So I used silicone oven rack guards to go over those edges and it seems to be just fine.",
