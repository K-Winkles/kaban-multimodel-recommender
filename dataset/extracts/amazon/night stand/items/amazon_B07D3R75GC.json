Everything did go together easily by hand and seemed sturdy enough but I would not trust anything heavy on it. It\u2019s a very light composite type plastic, almost foam like inside.I bought 2, stained and sealed a 12\u201d wide board and screwed it to the tops to make a nice fireplace mantle/table to replace an old dark faux mantle that blocked windows and made the room too dark. It worked great for my project but honestly if they were going to be out in the open and used as end tables I would have probably returned them. They just look a little to cheesy for that to me with the jigsaw puzzle construction and very visible screws. They are cheap and an easy storage fix for a small space if you don\u2019t mind the look or it\u2019s tucked away mostly out of view.Packaged wellFast shippingEasy assemblyRelatively sturdyLight weightSmall sizeSlightly lacking appearance with so many visible joints and hardware",

Not exactly particle board but a blend of wood & foam? Either way - it\u2019s very light weight, easy on the eyes & fairly easy to build.You\u2019ll need to apply some weight on the product when shoving in the \u201cpuzzle pieces\u201d so a rubber mallet *may* be required for some people, but a firm palm slap will also do the trick. Just remember the material that you\u2019re working with as to not apply so much force that you end up snapping a piece or breaking an entry point.",

It wasn\u2019t confusing, just physically a challenge to make the pieces fit together.Not sure if the pieces I got were cut wrong, but the info says you MIGHT need a small hammer to assemble. No, you WILL need that hammer. Even with it, you risk breaking the flimsy wood (I did end up breaking a small piece off because you basically have to force the pieces together). Also, use the screws provided to give it a little more stability.Looks nice, will serve the purpose I need it for (coffee stand for home office), but it\u2019s not worth the $30 price. Good luck finding something cheaper that looks half this nice, though.",

The other we have on our porch between our rocking chairs. Made out of PVC, it should last forever! It is a great product. The pieces fit together very well. It even came with gloves to wear while putting the pieces together so you don't hurt your hands. There are no rough edges. The instructions are excellent with pictures to explain how to do it. It took me about 10 minutes to assemble. It even came with the right size screwdriver. What company ever sends the equipment to assemble like that! I am very, very pleased with this inexpensive but durable table. Excellent product!!!!",
