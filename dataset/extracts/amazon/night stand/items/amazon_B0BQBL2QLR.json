                "reviewText": "Let me just start off by saying that this is a very nice and good quality nightstand. I decided I wanted to do my daughters room over and brought this night stand to go with the decor. My partner purchased one as well for Christmas for her so she could have one on each side of her bed. The one that my partner brought was built first and there wasn\u2019t any issues with putting it together or with any of the pieces. Very easy and quick to put together. Once she was finished with that one she started to put together the one I purchased. Half way through the build she noticed that a piece that\u2019s suppose to be at the front bottom of the dresser, wasn\u2019t painted at all like the other pieces. They forgot to paint the side that\u2019s visible. If it wasn\u2019t visible I wouldn\u2019t really care but it\u2019s an all white dresser. Overall it\u2019s a great nightstand. I wish I didn\u2019t have to paint it myself but taking it apart and sending it back isn\u2019t happening. Just make sure before putting it together check all the sides of the pieces to make sure they are painted or damaged. The crazy thing is we didn\u2019t even see that side because it was face down and the other side of it which was painted was facing upwards.",
