It\u2019s easy to put together, takes maybe 30-45 minutes, all tools are included (allen wrench & a screwdriver). It is not big, note its measurements, don\u2019t go by the picture.The top of the nightstand has two three-prong outlets and two rectangular USB-A power ports. Made of nice looking laminate boards and black steel framework. The drawers are one piece, made of thick canvas fabric and come folded. Once assembled they function well, no rollers or tracks, and this greatly adds to its speedy assembly and low price.This is a nice nightstand, suitable for a small bedroom, but not as, say, a wedding present.",
