                "reviewText": "This dresser was very easy to set up and looks exactly like the pictures!! It took less than twenty minutes to setup and it didn\u2019t require any tools and was very intuitive. The fabric dressers make it super lightweight and easy to move around, while the wooden handles give the drawers a more sleek appearance. Despite the lightweight feel, the fabric feels quite heavy duty and I have no problem fitting clothing and larger items folded up inside. Great for a dresser and can double as a nightstand as well. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for an affordable yet high quality dresser for small spaces!!",
