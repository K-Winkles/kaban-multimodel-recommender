            "SPACIOUS STORAGE SPACE: While the end table is cute, it suprisingly has room for a lot. The bedside table has 1 drawer for hidden storage and 2 spaces for open storage. The fabric bin is perfect for private things and the top and the open shelf for lamp, clock, books, etc.",
            "MULTIPURPOSE: The side table is light hence it's easy to move it around. Great to have by bed so you can have phone, charger, eyeglasses and other nighttime necessities within reach. We also recommend placing it by sofa, couch or armchair as it is handy for serving coffee and snacks.",
            "SOLID & DURABLE: Sturdy metal frame, water-resistant wood board and high-grade fabric ensure long service time of the nightstand. 4 adjustable feet could protect your floor from scratches. Easy-to-pull handle makes opening and closing of drawer smooth and easy.",
            "EASY ASSEMBLY: The end table measures 15.8\" L x 15.8\" W x 20.2\" H. The bedside nightstand comes with detailed instructions and all hardware needed for installation, you can easily assemble it in 15 minutes by yourself. Assembly video has been uploaded for help."

It\u2019s not real wood (I don\u2019t think) but it looks like it! I was a little worried about the material of the drawer because I thought it wouldn\u2019t be sturdy but it\u2019s actually good! Just don\u2019t put anything that could leak in it (I mean you could put a water bottle because it would dry fine) because it would be hard to clean it if it was like juice or something sticky that attracts bugs. It was really easy to put together and it came with extra screws and stuff just in case you strip one or lose it. It looks a little awkward next to my bed because my bed is pretty tall LOL but it\u2019s great for the price! I\u2019m a broke college student so this is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I had been looking for the perfect bedside table to hide my CPAP machine. This is it. I wanted to hide it in a drawer, but then how does the cable hang out of the back? Well, the drawer is made of a flexible fabric covered material, so you can just push it out a bit to slip the cord behind the unit. The drawer snaps back in shape, and it's soft enough so there's no cord damage.I put the power supply in a basket in the bottom shelf. I think it would squeeze in the drawer if I tried.When a sleep I leave the drawer open a few inches. I appreciate having the drawer at the top. (Some tables have the shelf on top and a drawer beneath.) When I wake up it's easy to open the door, turn the CPAP off, and put the tubes in the drawer.Initially I used a shorter (21\" high) table of the same style from the same manufacturer. (I bought it for another room and hijacked it for my room.) The table was a bit low, making it hard to grab the drawer handle from the bed. So I bought the taller one (25\") which is close to level with my bed. Much easier! And the taller unit has a taller drawer, measuring 7\" (vs 5\".)I realize not all CPAPs are the same size, particularly if you have a water tank. To be sure, check out the measurements first. The drawer is 7\" high x 13.75\" wide x 10.5\" deep.Mind you, this bedside stand isn't fancy. It's sturdy enough. But what do you expect for the price? Considering how this hides the CPAP with ease, I couldn't be happier.",
