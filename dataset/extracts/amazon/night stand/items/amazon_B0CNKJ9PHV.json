                "reviewText": "I got this for my son, who was using an old footstool as a nightstand, so this quite a dramatic upgrade. It looks great in his room and offers a place for his phone as well as whatever books he's reading. He doesn't often use the charging feature because he already had a charging station set up, but I think it will come in handy. Here's what he had to say about putting it together (and he also noted that the manual suggested two people put it together; in hindsight, he says, that's probably the best way to go, but he did it solo):The nightstand is nice. The instructions are very clear and the extra reminders they have within the instructions to check that you have something put together properly were very helpful. Some small gripes that I have with it are that some steps, such as adding in the electrical socket, are annoying and easy to mess up, and the backboard didn't have all the necessary holes for screws to go through.I asked about the backboard screw holes and he said there aren't enough and that he'd have to add more himself if he wanted to use all the screws. His solution was simply to use the ones that did have a hole and leave it at that, and that seems to work just fine.",

                "reviewText": "While this nightstand is on the smaller side, it is perfect for our smaller bedroom. For its smaller size, it has far more storage than our larger ones do. The assembly took a little time, but it wasn't difficult. The instruction recommended two people and while that would have sped up the process, I was able to assemble by myself. I love that the bottom is open for using a basket or fabric bin in. The enclosed space is nice for storing smaller things you want protected. The door opens and closes easily, but the magnetic closure is VERY strong. No fear of that door falling open. My favorite feature of this nightstand is the charge ports in the top! It has one standard outlet and two USB outlets. It makes for a great place for a lamp, phone charger, etc. The power cord is long enough to reach behind the bed to be plugged in. The wood coloring is beautiful.",

It's got plenty of room, and that bottom shelf is nice and tall and deep, which is a cool design choice to me.Outlets are great to have and they work great! The little lip around the surface helps me not knock stuff off, because I'm realllllly bad about that.",

                "reviewText": "This can be used as a small side table or night stand, but we needed something to sit on top of our crafting table and this worked perfect.There is a drop down panel to access a storage area. The drop down panel is held by a very strong magnet. Under this storage area is an open area. The top of the stand has a power outlet and two USB plug ins.The cabinet itself is sturdy, but not too heavy to place on top of another cabinet or table. Putting it together wasn't too difficult, although I would recommend reading the instructions first. We had to take it apart a couple of times because we got things backwards.",
