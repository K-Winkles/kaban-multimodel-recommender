Only problem I had was that the wall anchors and screws provided to mount the unit on the wall were flimsy and broke during installation. I picked up 1/4\" x 3\" wall anchors at HomeDepot, drilled out the holes in the unit, and the unit was securely installed. I was impressed at how sturdy the assembled unit was.",

The drawer does not have any support so just hangs loose but there is a catch at the end to prevent it from coming all the way out. Not sure if I'll hang this up. Will probably get something else.Instructions are very busy looking but it is very repetitive once you begin. It says it takes 15 minutes but it took me 35 minutes to assemble.
