All tools it's provided, easy step by step directions, all the screws and tools are separated with clear labels. You really can't do wrong with this. If I had a bigger space I would've gotten another one.",

                "reviewText": "Like others have commented, the drawer is one of the last pieces to put together if you follow the instructions and low and behold the 'C' screws for the front of the drawer were not long enough to reach the 'D' receivers. So all that time wasted. Another nice lady posted a video so you can see. Ordered 2, one is still on the way, and in the process of a replacment for this one. We'll see if the parts are correct on the other 2, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll update the review if the problem is remedied with the replacement and 2nd stand.**update 12/5 the second stand arrived so I started with the drawer and once again the screws were not long enough. So either they are sending the wrong parts or they have drilled out the holes on the drawer sides in the wrong spot.**update 12/13 the THIRD table finally came with the correct pieces. So I'm attempting yet again to buy another matching piece and see if it will come correct since I know it's possible. It's upsetting that I originally bought them on sale and can no longer get that price after all the headaches it's caused to get even ONE correct item. So beware, if your hardware doesn't come in the red bag, individually packaged it's probably incorrect. If your cam lock bolts are silver, they are incorrect, they need to be the black/brown set.**Update 12/26 The 4th table came. I checked the parts and though the table looks the same it came with a completely different set of drawer parts. This one had wooden dowls and brackets instead of cam locks. I decided to give it a go but found that the drawer guides were incorrect. They were ball bearing glides, already installed on the inside panels of the table itself, and could not be taken apart to install the proper piece to the drawer itself. So here we are returning this table yet again, after having assembled 90% of the table. Some day I'll have matching tables. and if the company had any decency I'd be refunded for the hassle.**Update 1/10...wrong again, so after sending back 5 tables & keeping the ONE correct table, I'm done...I initiated a refund for this table because I'm tired of wasting my time checking and finding the wrong parts and then having to find time to drop it off for an Amazon return. I'll find tables somewhere else and donate the current one I have.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the table itself with the drawer, shelves and outlets for USBs and electric. The size is good for my use.My complaint is with the packet of screws, cams, pins etc. The wrong one was included.The cams and pins were too small causing us to purchase the correct size from the local hardware store (not reimbursed by Amazon) and the screws had a sharp point instead of the blunt tip pictured causing the tips to crack the surface of the table.My options were to return it for a refund or return it for a replacement. Either way it meant a complete deconstruction and putting all the various 20 some parts back in the small box it came in. I\u2019m not that good at puzzles. And could I be sure I wouldn\u2019t have the same problem if I exchanged it?Lesson learned: Do more than a quick count to make sure it\u2019s all there like I did but closely compare the fasteners to the inventory pictures that comes with the product to make sure they\u2019re the right size.",
