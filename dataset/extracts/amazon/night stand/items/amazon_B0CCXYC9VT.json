Once it was easily assembled by me, a totally not savvy adult, it was stable and attractive. I used a level to make certain that it was, well, level. It certainly was with no additional finagling. I am thinking about purchasing another one! I use it for those items that one would store in a nightstand, such as nightgowns, skin care, a book, etc.",

Too small, drawer front obviously seems like wood printed in canvas (opaque), not like the laminated top (gloss)...And not even any perks such as AC outlets nor USB ports like many have...",

Then try again.As is clearly visible in my photo the whole table has a beautiful, glossy wood. Except the drawer. Which is fake, printed ink, and no shine. It sucks.Further more the drawer is too tall to fit in any of the shelf slots. So you end up with a weird, large empty spot where a shelf SHOULD be.Waste of money. It got two stars because it was easy to put together, simple instructions, and nice packaging for tools/supplies. This is a DONT buy.",
