Assembly was easy, I did it by myself in an hour. The knob is NOT metal like the description claims. It\u2019s plastic painted gold. Again if it\u2019s priced around 80$ for 2 than no biggie especially since you already knew that this is not a quality product, it\u2019s a need this for a good price product. I purchased for a second guest room that will probably never get used so price was good for what it is.",

                "reviewText": "My first impression unboxing this side table was not great. It feels cheap and (as you can see in the photo) one of the corners is messed up out of the box. It was pretty easy to assemble, although even the connectors don't feel secure so I have serious doubts that it'll last. I would expect this from a table half the price, but I'm a little disappointed given the $60 price tag. I'd look for another option if you have a $60 budget for a side table.Full Disclosure: I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program, but my review is entirely my own and not altered at all by my participation in the Vine program. The program asks that we review the products we receive, but it doesn\u2019t specify that the reviews should be positive or a specific star rating.",

The whole assembly took roughly 30 mins as the instruction manual was easy to follow.All the accessories/screws etc came with the package & I just needed a screwdriver.One complaint that I have though is the back panel, which I found to be a bit longer causing the gaps that you can see in one of the pics. Its not end of the world though.Still adds beauty to my living room with its pristine white color.Recommeded!!",

It\u2019s very well made and the wood is much thicker than the other nightstands I looked at. It was easy to assemble taking about 20 minutes or so. It has plenty of storage inside as well as some in the cubby above. I highly recommend this table due to the fact that it\u2019s a lot stronger and thicker than the competition.",

Not as sold as I like it to be. I can\u2019t overly complain because it works still \ud83d\ude02 it is cute and simple and that\u2019s what I wanted.
