                "reviewText": "This nightstand is good for someone that is looking for a simple and affordable option. It is quite a decent nightstand that does its job but does not exceed expectations. First off, the materials are not made up of the finest pieces of wood. The pieces are quite thin and seem fragile. When I was assembling it, I was afraid of being too rough with them and accidentally breaking them. The piece of wood that goes in, as the front of the drawer, seemed as if it was peeling and deteriorating in the bottom corners. This was very concerning when I first began the assembly process, especially since that was a piece that would always be exposed. Luckily, after fully assembling the stand, I realized that the peeling parts weren\u2019t too noticeable. On the other hand, the assembly was not too difficult. I had to stop halfway through the assembly and then continued it a few hours later and I was able to pick it back up easily. The only complaint I have about the assembly is that none of the parts were labeled. This sometimes made the assembly confusing and bothersome. Some parts do seem similar, but they can sometimes be different sizes or just different parts altogether. I managed to assemble different parts of the nightstand incorrectly which became frustrating. However, those problems could easily be fixed by labeling the components of the nightstand. So far, the nightstand has held up well. Once fully assembled, it is quite sturdy. I have placed a multitude of items on it and it has not shown any signs of giving out. It has not received any scratches or signs of damage at all. I have younger siblings that have spilled liquids on it and I was able to wipe everything off without any problems. No matter what material they have poured on the nightstand, it has not received any permanent damage. It is impossible to notice that anything has been poured on it once it has been cleaned up. For the two months that I\u2019ve had it, it has held up well and I haven\u2019t encountered any major issues with it. Initially, the drawer and the cabinet both initially gave me a concern. Once the drawer is fully pulled out, it begins to sag. This is one of the flaws that the nightstand has and one of the places where it is evident that some corners were cut. It is not a big deal to me as I rarely ever must pull out the drawer completely, but it is noticeable that the drawer is not well made. Nonetheless, the drawer houses whatever I need without any concern of it not holding up. On the other hand, the piece of wood holding up the items stored in the cabinet could be concerning. Most of the pieces of wood had a place where you would squeeze it into and then secure it with a screw, that is not true for the bottom piece. It is a very thin piece of wood and is not secured in any way, besides sitting on top of the inner edges of the frame of the nightstand. To me it is not a big deal as it only stores my video games and movies. However, I would not recommend storing anything heavy within there as it is difficult to guarantee that the thin piece of wood would be able to hold it. To reiterate, do NOT store your favorite bowling ball in the cabinet. The Winsome accent table is a good bargain. Although not the highest quality, it gets the job done and does not cause any problems. At this price range there is not much more that one could ask for. It is not heavy duty, but it should not be expected to be. Regardless of its more budget-friendly materials, it still makes for a great looking nightstand that should last for a fair amount of time.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A real steal, these are nice!",
                "reviewText": "I have purchased 4 of these tables, and am completely happy with them for the price paid. Really, I consider them a total steal.I bought a pair of the dark brown/black/espresso colored ones about a year and a half ago to serve as end tables by the couch in my living room. They look nice, and we have had no issues with quality or functionality, so when it was recently decided that new nightstands were needed by a bed, a pair of white tables were ordered.In both locations, we wanted decent looking but didn\u2019t want to spend hundreds of dollars each. End tables and night stands at real furniture stores easily reached up in to the hundreds of dollars per unit range, so we decided to expand our search. We checked the more \u201cquirky\u201d and discount-oriented home goods stores and, to be frank, the offerings looked like junk. There is a Big Blue Emporium Of Swedish-Designed Goods And Meatballs (you know what place I\u2019m talking about) located in our town, so we checked there. We found something acceptable looking and reasonably priced, but still there was a nagging doubt. \u201cLet\u2019s check Amazon\u201d we thought. And so we did. And here we are.All 4 tables arrived in fine flat-pack condition. Nothing was dinged or damaged, no missing pieces, nothing troubling to report. All pieces are made of real wood, not fiberboard or particle board or cardboard, like products from that other place we had considered. The benefit of having real wood is that it glues up nice, and if you have any scratches, it\u2019s relatively easy to repair. The directions are simple, but sensible and easy to follow. With this sort of furniture, I always glue pieces together in addition to the screws just to add a bit of strength to the whole thing. Everything went together fine, and fit properly. The door was already assembled within the face frame, so no adjustment or fitting was needed.As for colors/ finishes: We are very happy with the coloring and quality of finish of these. The espresso color is a very deep brown/black that is evenly applied over the whole unit, no \u201csplotchiness\u201d. These tables, despite our best efforts to prevent it, regularly get drinks placed on them without coasters, and there are spills, and we have yet to see any rings or other defect appear in the surface finish. The white tables are a smooth flat-ish white paint (which is what we wanted), not a stained white-wash. I had one spot (about the size of a paper clip) on one of the white tables where the finish was a little marred. It wasn\u2019t a scratch or damage, it just looked like the paint hadn\u2019t been applied quite right. I had some paint on hand that matched just right, and a light touch-up made it disappear.I\u2019ve only got a couple of things that I would list as \u201ccons\u201d though they aren\u2019t deal-breakers, nor are they enough of a problem to cause me to lower my rating. I mean, let\u2019s be real and recognize that when you\u2019re only spending fifty dollars for a piece of furniture to be delivered to your house, it\u2019s probably not going to have the same quality as a piece that is hundreds of dollars more expensive. You should know going in to the deal that you\u2019re making a compromise somewhere.Anyhow, my \u201ccons\u201d:-The bottom of the unit is a thin piece of plywood that is simply laid on the frame. It is not fastened in place, and it \u201cfloats\u201d around a bit. Also, it doesn\u2019t strike me as overly-sturdy. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to keep your barbells or encyclopedias in there, but it\u2019s a weaker part of the construction that I thought would be helpful to point out to people. If I were worried about it, it could easily be glued/nailed into place, but I haven\u2019t found a practical issue with it.-The door\u2019s orientation isn\u2019t easily switched. If you want to switch it so that the hinges are on the left instead of the right, you are going to have to do a little wood-work, it\u2019s not a simple flip-flop. This may be a deal-breaker for some people, but it hasn\u2019t really bothered me in use. Again, I thought it would be helpful to point this out to people.At the end of the day, I can say that I am very happy with these units. I\u2019ve had them long enough that I think I\u2019ve given them a decent real-world trial, and they are something I would buy again (and I have!), and recommend to others.",

Instructions are well written\u2022The color was as expected: Dark fake wooden look\u2022Looks nice, as long as you dont take a closer inspection...\u2022Professionally package with lots of foamCons:\u2022Feather light material: nice and easy to carry around but it shows how cheap it is\u2022Fingerprints shows easily\u2022Some wood pieces came in with a dust like white substance which I had a hard time to removeConclusion:If you are looking for a cabinet that looks halfway decent and you simply want to fill in a room this might be the one. Cheap quality but the price makes sense. Great way to hide a router or modem. But if you are looking for an \u201caccent\u201d piece of impeccable quality with lots of room, please skip this product. Still, definitely worth 5 stars.",

Was missing magnetic piece for door so door would not stay closed. Drawer felt as if it would fall apart if I had more than a magazine in it. Basically, if you want something that is totally over-priced, that isn't fit to have out in your home, and that is damaged and missing parts, this item is for you. If that's not what you are looking for, do not buy this piece of junk, or dig a hole in your yard to put it in. Amazon refused to send replacement item. Bounced me around for an hour from service agent to service agent, until finally telling me they could initiate a return, something I could have done myself by clicking a button. Overall, the table was a huge steaming turd, Amazon refused to send replacement, the customer service was not only useless, but also took forever and then didn't solve the issue in the end. Plus, they refused to offer to have the items picked up at my home for return, so I have to lug this heavy package to my car, then to the Post Office to return it, something I was trying to avoid by ordering it on Amazon in the first place rather than dragging it home from a local store.I would strenuously advise anyone think about buying this cheap piece of junk to re-think their choice, especially if they don't want to get jerked-off by Amazon customer service for an hour, without them bringing you to a satisfying result in the end.",
