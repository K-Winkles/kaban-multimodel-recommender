Building was pretty difficult! its impossible to do the whole project with that tiny little screw handle thing. It turned my hands red and i had to take many breaks. 2 of the screws ended up stripping but i managed to replace the worse one and use a pliers to get the better one flush w the surface. Luckily i was able to fit the right allan bit for my drill and finish the project. I decided to keep the back panel off for cord managment and im so glad i did. Its the perfect size for my laptop and i got some matching floating shelves for my glasses too!",

After trying in vain for about 40 minutes to get the screws in for the first step of assembly, I gave up and packed it back up and will be returning it. I\u2019m no stranger to putting together flatpack furniture and this was only the first step! They give you an Allan key to put these screws in, which is a joke. Maybe if I\u2019d had a high powered drill it would have worked but even with multiple screwdrivers I couldn\u2019t get them in. A total waste of time and effort.",

                "reviewText": "I like the colour of the nightstand, it goes very well with the decor already in my bedroom. As far as the assembly; the first couple of instructions took a couple of tries but the remaining I would say was user friendly. The nightstand is quite smaller than I expected, if I had know how small it would have been I most likely would have opted in for a bigger one. Overall the craftsmanship is similar to that of an ikea table. It is decent material, that should last you quite awhile but again ,you get exactly what you pay for.",
