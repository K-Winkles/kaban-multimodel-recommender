Little pricey for being partical board but definitely better than something you\u2019d buy at Walmart! Overall easy to assemble. You\u2019ll definitely need a drill to save you some time! The outlets are handy but you don\u2019t have to put them in if you don\u2019t want too.",

And all parts were there , packaging was great and their were no defects in the product.",

                "reviewText": "First and foremost, this nightstand is not tall at all. I'm 5'6 and it comes up to just above my knees. The pictures make it look a lot bigger than it really is.It has a nice design, but for the cost it's a difficult recommendation. Everything here is made of chipboard, has rough edges and is held together with dowel rods or locking pinions.The power strip is convenient but I'd not plug anything important into it over a properly rated surge protector.Still, the drawers are smooth and the extra storage is convenient, so no complaints there. It took me maybe an hour to build the thing by myself.",

When I received my nightstands and put one together set it next to my bed and realized it looked like a toddler night stand. Absolutely tiny! Pictures in advertisements so deceiving. Obviously I was going to return them because they looked horrible. I repacked the one I put together, went to print out the return labels and was informed I would have to pay shipping for both of them. It would cost $63 to ship back both. I paid $200 total for both. I\u2019m so angry with this company. Do not buy from them. If you don\u2019t like the product, you will be stuck with them like I am now.",
