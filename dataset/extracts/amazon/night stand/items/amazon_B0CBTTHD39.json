Immediately on unpacking, you can tell that he product is not as \"high end\" as the pictures appear and also is much more petite than it appears in images. That aside, it is the poor quality of the product that is the issue, the unit being extremely light weight and, although attractive, it does not function as expected. I bought two of these, for each side of my bed, and both were faulty/malfunctioned. I'm experienced in flat pack assembly, skilled even, however, when the drawers were closed, in one unit the drawer jammed completely shut and cannot be opened and the other unit the drawer partially jammed, rendering both useless. Consequently, I did not even bother trying to plug them in to see if the electronics worked (although other reviewers have had issues), instead they are being returned immediately for refund and, unfortuately, I cannot recommend this product at all as they lack in quality and function.",
