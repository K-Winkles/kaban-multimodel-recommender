                "reviewText": "The instructions included for this nightstand are much more clear and simple than, for example, instructions for I_k_e_a furniture. There are numerous steps, but each step involves just one action. To make assembly even easier, unpack everything and check each item off the enclosed list before starting. The number labels had come off two of the pieces, but I figured out what they were during that initial inventory and labeled them with sticky notes. I assembled it mostly by myself, but not completely. There were a few times when I needed an extra pair of hands. The kit had all of the necessary hardware, including extras of most screws and bolts. You'll need a screwdriver and (ideally) a cordless drill with a screwdriver bit. The finish is delicate - bits of it chipped off around a few of the screws, but none of those parts are visible. This is not a solid wood piece that you'll hand down over generations. For what it is, it looks great and is very practical.It was purchased as a gift for an older person who has TONS of stuff around her bedside: medications, tissues, reading glasses, remote controls, water bottles, books, hair brush, and etc. All of those things fit in/on this table. The light is bright, and provides a nice ambient light when dimmed - definitely a plus. She's thrilled about the USB ports for charging her phone and Kindle. It would be a good addition to a kid's room, too.",

                "reviewText": "Very cute ok but sort of difficult getting it together also use screw driver when instructions says so. Drawers are kind of funny don't close all the way, they all do but you have to lift a drawer up to get it all to fit in. The sticker for thr pad for the sensor is very weak. Be sure to have velcro tape instead mucb stronger. The image on the side shows it bigger compared to real life but I appreciate it so far with the controllers smooth material doesn't scratch love the knobs but they aren't snugged fit . Just be prepared for it not meeting your expectations 100 percent. A little too tiny for me but I'll work it out. I love the idea gonna keep it and make it work",

The assembly process was chill, it looks great in my room, even the cats approve. The only changes I would make would be warm LEDs instead of cool and maybe piggyback the power source for them off the power strip so only one plug was needed.",

It has the cool hand sensor feature for the light and all the chargers but in the end it\u2019s still fake wood and will probably end up looking like crap in a couple years , I hope I\u2019m wrong because that was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever had to put together.",
