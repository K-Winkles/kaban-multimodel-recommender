While these were a bit pricier than I would've liked, I had them on my shopping list forever. So when they went on sale for Prime Day, I immediately ordered two.These were easy to assemble, and I was able to set both of them up in about half an hour. Other reviewers commented on different wood tints/colors; the majority of the table arrived with the same tone/color thankfully. The one exception was the small ledge that sits in front of the rattan; it is a slightly different shade than the others. However, when assembled, it is barely noticeable.When setting the tables up, I noticed that the manual indicated that bumpers were included, but neither package brought any. I reached out to the company (as recommended in the manual), and they sent me the rubber bumpers for the glass. It took them a couple of weeks to arrive, but they made it and now the tables are good to go.All in all, happy with my purchase, and that the company did respond when I reached out over missing pieces.",
