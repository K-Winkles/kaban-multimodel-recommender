                "reviewText": "The bed side tables are a fantastic addition to any bedroom. They are sturdy and hold up well over time, even with regular use. They are stable and level and don't wobble and hold weight well. Assembling them is a breeze and can be done in about 10 minutes, making them a great option for anyone who wants something functional without a lot of hassle.One of the most impressive things about these bed side tables is their affordability. They offer great value for the money, and it's hard to believe how much they cost considering their high quality and durability.The material used to make the tables hasn't chipped and scratched despite rough and tough use, I'm sure they will look great for years to come. Great for students on a budget. The neutral colors of gray and black make them versatile and easy to match with any decor style.The bed side tables are a great option for people on a budget who want to spruce up their bedroom decor. They are the perfect size to hold a lamp, phone, water bottle, and other small items that you might need within reach. The rounded corners make them safe and practical, as they won't accidentally poke or injure anyone.The addition of a storage shelf on the bottom of the tables provides extra space to store items like books or magazines, making them even more functional.Overall, I would highly recommend these bed side tables to anyone looking for a functional and affordable option that looks great in any bedroom. They are sturdy, easy to assemble, and provide excellent value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "Awesome in every way!\u2022 The typical Amazon PRIME ordering system comes through again -- quick delivery, courteous service.INSTRUCTIONS\u2022 The shelving unit comes with an EXCELLENT set of easy to follow instructions. These include proper English spelling, grammar, and syntax. As a senior technical writer creating such instructions since the 1970s, I feel your pain when directions are less than intelligible. These instructions will make your day and help you make your shelf.THE SHELF\u2022 Six basic parts consist of four legs, a center shelf, and an upper shelf. These are made of sawdust and glue, right, with a nice veneer in your choice of colors and faux wood patterns. Pretty good quality for the price.\u2022 The hardware pieces are all grouped together in cellophane bags, and those come in one larger bag.\u2022 The directions predict about a 15-minute assembly time and encourage the reading of the instructions in their entirety BEFORE proceeding.\u2022 Get a smaller tipped Phillips screwdriver and a hammer to start the assembly.\u2022 It all goes together logically, follow the instructions.FINAL PRODUCT\u2022 Excellent, very cool. Fits the need perfectly.\u2022 The manufacturer claims that the shelf unit will hold 15 pounds (6,8 kilograms) on the top shelf, and 10 pounds (4,5 kilograms) on the mid-shelf. I don't know why anyone would put that much weight on it, but it should hold a few books, a laptop computer, etc., or a vase with water holding flowers, and more.GREAT SHELF! ENJOY!GET SOME!",

The engineered wood will start to bubble and chip as the product ages and the plastic legs will start to strip as it's assembled and disassembled. Overall though, it does the job reasonably well of providing a place to put keys/phone/alarm clock bedside. This piece is especially good for a smaller room where a full sized night stand may be too much or a college dorm. However, the build quality is very low and the materials are very cheap- do not count on holding onto this piece for more than a couple of years.Overall, a reasonably priced night stand substitute for small rooms or dorms that's probably just going to get thrown away during a move.",
