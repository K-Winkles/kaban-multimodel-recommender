                "reviewText": "I was tired of rearranging cords around beds when our kids and friends come to stay because everyone unplugs stuff to plug in electronics. I was looking for an inexpensive solution and these nightstands seemed to be perfect. They look nice, seem somewhat sturdy and all outlets work great. Bought six for three guest beds. There is a flaw with the parts. However, my rating is only a 4, because one nightstand in each order (3 of 6) had a hole that was incorrectly drilled in the top level, so we were only able to secure it with 3 screws, rather than the 4 provided. And on one nightstand it was tough to get a third screw to set property. The nightstand is certainly still usable, but that was an annoying time-waster when putting them together.",

I don't expect them to last very long... They look really nice when finished but I expect to do some repairs in the future...Update...Seller seen my review and made it right.. they were over and beyond expectations.. definitely a great customer service experience.. thank you",
