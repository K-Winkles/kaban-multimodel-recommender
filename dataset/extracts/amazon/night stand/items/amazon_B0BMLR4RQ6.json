                "reviewText": "I wasn't quite sure what to expect with these side tables. They were certainly affordable and looked nice on screen but I was cautious based on some of the reviews. Took a chance and ordered two sets of the rustic brown: two for bedroom nightstands and two for side tables in another room. Was pleased with the product. Once my husband and I got all the pieces laid out in order, the tables were quite easy to put together. Wasn't missing any of the hardware, in fact, we had extra pieces left over. The tables worked well for the lighter weight items I put on them, however, I would not recommend anything super heavy. They looked very nice in both rooms. Two things kept me from a 5-star review: First, there were a few minor nicks/blemishes on the edge of a couple of the shelves. Don't know if this happened with craftsmanship or damage in transit but fortunately they were on the underside of the shelves so not really visible once they were put together. Also, a couple of the holes weren't drilled very well but that didn't prevent the tables from assembling properly. Second, while the little number stickers were great reference, most of them were rather difficult to get off and left residue on the pieces that I really had to work at to clean off. All in all, they are great tables for the price and I would recommend. (Just ordered another set!)",
