Definitely worried it could break under pressure as it seems like it\u2019s the cheapest \u201cwood\u201d if that is what it is. Pretty easy to put together even though the screw that was included wanted my hands to bleed. Overall happy of my purchase since it was very affordable and fits in the corner perfect!",

                "reviewText": "This is a simple looking end table. It is put together like a jigsaw puzzle. The product is fairly simple to put together however be very careful the material it is made out of crumbles very easily. When assembling do it in a location that can easily be vacuumed or swept up since there is a fine white powder/dust all over this unit. the powder/dust gets everywhere. Once assembled you will need to wipe the entire shelf down to get all the residual white dust off of it. It is not very strong/durable I feel as if it will fall apart/biodegrade over time. The overall look once assembled is actually ok. It is not worth the price paid. I would say this is more of a $10-$15 dollar table. If I had to purchase this all over again I would not. I would return this table but disassembling it and trying to pack it up into the tiny box it came in without breaking the pieces would be to much. I would think twice if you are thinking about purchasing this item.",
