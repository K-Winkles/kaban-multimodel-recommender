I thought it would would be wobbly when I saw all the pieces but they screw together very firmly. The charging station is perfect for my needs!I have only one tiny issue with this table and it's not enough to knock off a star but I want to mention it. It's a minor cosmetic complaint so it might be no big deal to some.The top surface has 4 holes for the bolts, the surface is black and the bolts are black... but the holes are not. The pale colored particle board is extremely visible around the hole edges which mars the perfect appearance of the top surface of the table. They did not paint the holes or include any sort of plastic cap to cover those up those like most do for aesthetic reasons. You could probably take a black sharpie to the holes before you screw things together to make them less visible. I have a 3d printer so I measured the holes and printed my own caps in black PLA to cover up the holes.",
