I needed a floating bedside table because my bed has drawers underneath and anything on the ground would mean the drawers can\u2019t open or is too far away to be useful. I didn\u2019t have a lot to spend, and this works perfectly.Easy to put together!Low profile!Surprisingly sturdy!I\u2019d buy another one and I\u2019d have no qualms recommending it to a friend. It doesn\u2019t FEEL like it would be so sturdy, but it\u2019s really a great deal for the price, style, and function!",

Put in screws carefully.It's a very cool idea, and with a better wood and finish, it would really be great. But if you have the time, put a finish on it, or if you like the raw look and aren't worried about water on the wood, go for it.Cheap enough to try. If you don't like it, you're not out much.",

                "reviewText": "I have some positive things to say, but also a few cons.Pros:As you can see in pictures, this is a cute shelf. And it does and looks like what is advertised. It feels sturdy. I'm using it as an office shelf, and it's holding up my plant and a few dishes well. I also like the gold color. I'm picky about gold color looking cheap, but this is nice. However....Cons:The boards of the shelves are a particle board and are covered in a laminate like some cheaper counter tops. It's fine, but not as quality feeling as I'd hoped. But the biggest issue was the design/construction. It was incredibly frustrating. For example, you have to screw the gold grates onto the particle boards (which are pre-drilled). But really, the pre-drilled holes must have not been wide enough because I had to put in a decent amount of elbow grease to screw these on. I don't mind elbow grease except that the gold grates didn't actually allow enough room for the height of my screwdriver (normal length) to fit vertically (see picture)... this led to screw stripping and a fair amount of frustration. Also, instructions could have been clearer. I had to unscrew the position of the gold grating at one point when I realized there was a better order to which shelf should be screwed in first. Hint: screw the top shelf on first, THEN the bottom shelf. I guess if I had thought enough steps ahead, I could have figured it out for myself, but then again better instructions might have helped too.",
