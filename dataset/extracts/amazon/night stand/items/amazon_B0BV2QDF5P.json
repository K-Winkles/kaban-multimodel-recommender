Yes, they're small but that's the beauty of them, they fit nicely into tight spaces and are couch height. They were also very easy to put together and even came with extra screws, which came in handy when my cats decided to play with the pieces. Best of all is the ability to charge your electronics. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Assembly was relatively easy and flexible with the ability to place the power block at either end of the table top. It is nice that the legs can be adjusted to stabilize and level on an uneven floor, you can even attach these to the wall if desired. The only thing to note is the power block does not allow for any grounded plugs. So you can charge your electronics and plug in a power block for usb-c but a lamp or heating pad plug won\u2019t fit in the outlets and will still need to be plugged into the wall or a traditional power strip. Overall this is a nice looking and functional compact table for small spaces.",
