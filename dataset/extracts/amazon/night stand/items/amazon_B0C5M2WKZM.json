                "reviewText": "The screws in this thing are incredibly tough, and the provided screwdriver is weak. The screws didn\u2019t strip, the screwdriver did. Never seen anything like this before. That\u2019s not a problem though, because I have plenty of other screwdrivers. The real problem comes with the very first set of screws you put in the thing for the drawer rails. They don\u2019t fit in all the way, they stripped the several screwdrivers I own, and are now stripping themselves. Again, wouldn\u2019t be a problem, I can live with a few screws sticking slightly out. But these screws have to be entirely in their place out of the way for the rail to move properly. The drawer does not fit in, and getting it in would mean it won\u2019t come out. 0 out of 10, lost blood and sweat trying to put this together, doesn\u2019t work in the end. Screw this.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Nice lighting, tricky to assemble, fine if you don't need a drawer",
                "reviewText": "I requested this product because I really needed a night stand and I thought the price would be great. I received this product for free through the Vine reviews program, and will be paying income tax on the value, and I do not personally think that the nightstand I received is worth the price I will end up paying (about half of retail). Purchasing this with the ability to return the product may be a different experience, but one could end up going through several products and wasting many hours of assembly.Spouse and I purchase a lot of furniture from a popular Swedish flatpack retailer, and we always assemble furniture ourselves. Spouse is an amateur carpenter and has built a number of larger items from scratch, including a storage bed frame, built-in bookcases, and nesting end tables. I mention these project because it took my efficient amateur carpenter spouse at least 3 hours to assemble this tiny, 2-foot-tall product, at which point he was stymied because the drawer refused to slide in. At first we believed the drawer slides were incorrectly paired, but after a brief correspondence with the company, we disassembled the drawer and tried them separately; they slide fine. The company suggested tightening the screws; this made it worse. At this point, we believe that the drawer itself is fractionally too small, so that the wheel on the end of the right-hand drawer slide (attached to the drawer) is unable to fit into the matching groove in the part of the slide attached to the frame. (In my correspondence with the company I also learned that the company does not have or provide replacement parts because this is distributed by Amazon). We were able to force the drawer in once, and get it out with great difficulty, at which point the wheel at the end of the drawer slide was badly chipped. Our current theory is that the drawer itself is fractionally too narrow; at least two other pieces were not cut quite right, so many corners of this product are not right angles. We plan to consult with a non-amateur carpenter before continuing, as the gaping hole (its current state) is better than a jammed drawer.The LED lights and the electrical outlets in the top work well. I will note that the top is quite small, so there is not a great deal of space for the FOUR electrical products accommodated by the 2 USB and 2 standard US outlets. My lamp, glasses, and phone together really fill the space. In the product description and representative images, there are 7 colored LEDs and no white, but the remote has no orange and instead has a bluish white that is my favorite. I often come to bed after my spouse, and leaving the white on a low setting beside the bed has been a great compromise: I can see to get to bed safely, but spouse is not kept awake (or awakened suddenly) by the light of a full lamp. The cord from the table to the outlet is nice and long, at least 3 feet but maybe more.In sum, if I had ordered this traditionally, I would have returned it or requested a replacement; because I personally needed a drawer more than LED lighting. If you really want the LEDs and are willing to gamble with your time, this could be worth trying as a traditional purchase. But in my instance, I regret this order now that I know there is no remedy for the poor design.For my needs, this is a 2-star. But only one part is broken (the drawer), and some people may love the LED and electrics and not care about a drawer, so I have compromised with a more neutral rating of 3 stars.",
