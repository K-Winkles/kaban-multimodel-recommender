Has enough room for my alarm clock, lamp, books, ETC. The drawer is large, and very suitable for my, and most peoples needs. I am very positively surprised and impressed by the workmanship and quality of this nightstand. Especially for the price! It was only like $40! Which is a slightly below reasonable price but many nightstands are like 70 or 80 for the same quality and looks!Thank you,B. W.",
