                "reviewText": "Ok so here's the deal... it started out not so good. At first it was fine and I'm building it and then I realize one of the pieces was manufactured with the holes on the wrong side...... and it was crucial it be in the right spot. I would have given it a 1* at that point because it wasn't able to be built at all. BUT I contacted the seller who was thorough and easy to understand. I sent photos and they were very helpful and sent me a replacement part for it. I then continued to build it and now it is completed and sitting next to me. I am giving it 5* because they were so great.The item itself... I'd say 4*. First, it has SO MANY screws. omg. I know, not really ratable... but holy crap it took a long time to get them all in. Then the drawers are not on gliding tracks so that's not horrible, but it could be improved since they did use the gliding drawer tracks on the lid. Next issue... the instructions were missing some things. Near the end, when attaching the drawer glider tracks to the top, it basically stops giving directions on when/how to do the screws. I figured it out because I've build other things, but that was strange to have good directions the whole time and then just... not right at the end. Lastly... I am not sure how to get the motion sensor light to work. I've followed the brief instructions on the back page of the book and it's just not doing anything. The light does work when I turn it on manually though so I'm not sure what the issue is. Positive (material is waterproof/resistant/water rolls off). Positive (comes with foam to carve out for your gun or whatever else you plan to store OR you can leave the foam out altogether like I am. Note: when you leave the foam out and open the top by sliding it forward... there is nothing stopping items from falling out the front of the nightstand as the front of the top compartment slides along with the lid. Not sure if that makes sense. It's basically a box and you slide the top open... but one of the walls is sliding too since it's attached to the top. This means you have to be careful about what you put in (or if you put in the foam it will prevent this like I\"m sure it is meant to. I am actually using this for storing $ / etc. not guns so I didn't want to keep the foam insert.Even after saying that.. I am happy with it and am currently using it. I would absolutely buy it again and am confident that if I have any issues, the seller will fix it. I did not mention to the seller that the motion sensor wasn't working because I personally do not need it to work.",

                "reviewText": "This nightstand comes loaded with features. The built-in LED light, lockable gun case, and USB charging port provide convenience, catering to various needs in one compact piece of furniture. Let me be upfront \u2013 assembling this nightstand is not for the faint of heart. The process was like tackling a complex puzzle with numerous moving parts, screws, bolts, and panels. The initial 1.5 hours were overwhelming, and I questioned my decision to open the box. It took me around four hours to complete the assembly, including breaks and dinner. But it does get manageable. There's a learning curve, and once you get the hang of it, the process starts to go by faster. Patience is key during the first stages, and the subsequent sections become more intuitive. It does come with the screwdriver which is all the necessary tool you need.The material, however, is not the sturdiest. Extra care is needed during assembly. I made a mistake at one point and attempted to unscrew, resulting in a cracked panel. While this was a setback, it's not a dealbreaker. The material requires careful handling to prevent any accidental damage.Once assembled, the nightstand lives up to its promise of functionality. The LED light is a bit too bright for me but the lockable drawer provides security, and the USB charging port is a convenient addition.",

                "reviewText": "Putting together this nightstand may take some time as there are many pieces and hardware involved. However, once it's all assembled, it looks really nice. Just a heads up, when you reach page 27 of the instructions, make sure to install parts Q and R. The instructions don't mention it, but you'll need to do this before reaching page 34. It can be frustrating to have to disassemble or loosen the build to install those parts after spending so much time assembling. But once it's all put together, the drawers slide smoothly, although I do wish they used actual slides like the ones for the locking top. Speaking of which, the locking top works perfectly and has plenty of storage space. I'm currently using it in my office to store small electronics.",

                "reviewText": "I was using a plastic rolling small chest of drawers for my nightstand and I hated it, so my quality bar for a replacement was pretty low. But this nightstand is absolutely awesome and is WAY nicer than I expected. It is black vinyl-covered engineered wood, however the vinyl is bonded really well, much better than other cheap furniture I've seen. It looks much more durable that typical particle board. The nightstand was very easy to assemble, however, give your self at least an hour because even though it's easy, there are a ton of parts and you just need to take your time with it. Once assembled, this thing is quite impressive. It has built-in LEDs in both the drawer and the lower cabinet. The LEDs are not only dimmable, but they also can be adjusted to any color in the spectrum. it is a very nice and impressive look in your bedroom. Plus the lights can be set to turn on when they sense movement so if you wake up in the middle of the night, you do not need to turn on your light. Finally there is a wireless phone charger built right into the top as well as USB and USB-C sockets for non-wireless charging needs. This nightstand really gives you a lot for your money and looks quite beautiful in any bedroom. When I get new bedroom firniture, I am going to get it to match this nightstand because it is a real keeper!",
