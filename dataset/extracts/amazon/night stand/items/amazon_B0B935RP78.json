                "reviewText": "I like the set. They do the job, look nice, and are reasonably sturdy. They drawers are a little flimsy, so you can't put anything too heavy in them. But really your .45 should be in a lock box, and it's mostly random stuff that ends up in the drawers anyway. There was enough room on the open shelf above the drawers for a CPAP machine, and enough room on the top for a clock and whatever tech you want to charge. The wireless charger worked pretty well with my Galaxy phone, but sometimes it's a little tricky to find the sweet spot to get the charging going.The only complaint I have about the set is that the light strip on one of the stands changes settings randomly on its own. I like to have the red light on most of the time, because its not too bright and doesn't mess with you night vision, but you can still see the floor around the bed. But sometimes it will go into demo mode and I will wake up in the middle of the night with it flashing and changing colors. The light in the other stand works fine, so I guess I just drew the short straw and got a wonky one.",

Only reason I\u2019m giving them 3 stars is because the lights on them turn on all on their own and they will do the super fast flashing, like a strobe light out of nowhere. They each have their own remote, but the one remote will control both. So when you try to turn one skitso light off, the other will turn on. Other than that, they are decent little nightstands.",
