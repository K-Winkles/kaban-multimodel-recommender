Definitely use a drill/electric screwdriver. The instructions for the glide bars was pretty unclear and we had to redo them, but minor quibble.They look gorgeous! The gold on the legs is more of a muted yellow-brown, not shiny gold, but I doubt anyone will noticeVery well packaged, no chips or damage. Sturdy, heavy. Very impressed",

It fell over and broke into little pieces. The screws that hold the legs on are short and shallow because the partial board is thin. So it clearly couldn\u2019t handle the weight of the drawers. Lucky for us no one was near it when it fell over. And the seller was contacted several times about refunding the money and refused to answer. So I say do not waste your money.",
