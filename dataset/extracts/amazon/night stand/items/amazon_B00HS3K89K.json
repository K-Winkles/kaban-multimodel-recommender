                "reviewText": "Where do I start?It is very disappointing these days that you never know what to expect when you open a box containing a product purchased online. As a former retailer I understand how important it is to sell products that you stand behind and know that the customer will be happy when they open the box and discover the shinny new item that they just purchased.As you may have guessed that was not my experience with 'the piece of junk' that this company just shipped to me. This end table, night stand was poorly constructed which I anticipated due to the price. However thats not why I am so extremely disappointed. The paint job was incomplete. Over painted in some areas, under painted in others. The door hinges had chunks of paint peeling off as it looked like they were just caked with paint. However that wasnt the worst part. This piece looked as if it was dirty when it was painted. The lower left corner of the door had a big black mark and scuff marks that looked like it was hit with a black fork lift tire. The side seems between different pieces of wood looked to have dirt in them that was painted over. The drawer didnt have any kind of rail so it just hangs down when you open it. Im sure it would fall out if you put anything heavy in it. This unit is just a piece of modern junk and whomever assembled it and painted it clearly didnt give a hoot about what he was building or care that it would end up in the hands of another person. The company that manufactures these pieces of junk knows what they are selling and this disgusts me to know end. This is a good example of why the global economy is a joke. No one is really held accountable. This thing probably cost five bucks to make and the poor soul who put it together probably made 50 Cents. Yes, you do get what you pay for but junk like this should never be allowed to be sold through companies like Amazon or similar retail outlets. No one is held personally responsible. I feel like sending Amazon a bill for the time its going to take for me to figure out how to re-pack this back up and then take it to the UPS store for return. I AM THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED! I actually rate this ZERO STARS!",

                "reviewText": "It's what I was looking for. Right size. Drawer and door that opens to right. Real wood. And 50% less than other sites.But it's not even close to the color pictured. I know that the online pictures can be bit different than reality. But this is way off. Was expecting light gray with a little washed look. Got solid dark grey. It really doesn't match my room but the thought of returning something of this size is overwhelming. I might move it to another room then try again at a furniture store.There are no guides on the drawer. At the price this was supposed to be, I would've expected it.I don't have much in it at the moment. But it came with a piece to anchor it to the wall, which is a bit disconcerting. Don't think I'll need it. It does wobble a little, but it seems heavy enough.",
