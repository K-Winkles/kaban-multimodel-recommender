                "reviewText": "**update: customer service was very good. They did their best to remedy the situation, so I am updating from 1 star to 3**This has been very disappointing. I bought two nightstands. One had a missing piece and one had a broken piece. I emailed masupo requesting replacement but heard nothing (it's been over a week). So I reached out to Amazon and they sent me a replacement nightstand and said ups will come get one of the old ones the next day and if I wasn't home, they would leave the return packaging slip. It's been a week and ups has not come. I don't know how to return this nightstand. It's too heavy to carry to ups.Meanwhile the new nightstand is horrible quality. It took me 4 hours to assemble (the first took roughly one hour) because the holes are in weird places, the premade slits for the sliding pieces are too big and show when assembled and the placement of the holes for the drawer rails is too high so the drawer is rendered functionless. The top piece is also not secure and comes off with a little pressure because the screw locks don't work. The quality of the replacement piece is very inferior to the original ones I received. What a huge disappointment. I have one good nightstand, one piece of trash I spent hours assembling and one box of nightstand parts I can seem to return.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. While unpacking several pieces were thinner than the amazon box it arrived in (like the drawer bottom, back of night stand) . I took photos but amazon said the format was not right which is strange since I put them on my phone. There was a slight damaged spot on the top corner but already had half assembled by the time we noticed. It stands around 21 inches from floor to top and part of that is the legs. I would recommend verifying dimensions because I didn't. The quality seems low for $60. I think pricing this is around $25 - $40 would be fair. The box of envelopes won't fit in the drawer as the box is too big. It is cute and serves the purpose I need it for and I don't want to wait for another I'm still going to look for other options as my need is more around 30 inches high and a larger drawer. There is no back for the shelf part. It did come with an instruction booklet. I think the legs and drawer pull are suppose to be rose gold I'm color but they look a little more copper in color while looking at it.",
