                "reviewText": "Love this nightstand for my new setup! Picture quality is a little dark - but just showing how cute it looks! Picked this color because it matches well with the wooden pieces on my bed frame and also provides a nice contrast to the flooring and grey headboard in my room. Setup was easy with all parts clearly labeled. Took about 20 min to finish building the nightstand. Overall it\u2019s very sturdy and has some weight to it so not worried about it feeling flimsy at all. Drawer slides in and out easily and I like that they made the knob match to the black (I\u2019ve seen some where it doesn\u2019t match and it\u2019s weird!) the drawer is small but perfect for what I need to put inside it. I like the shelf piecing on the bottom as well - will probably put a few books or laptop there if I\u2019m using at night. Price is also great as it includes 2 nightstands total for under $100. Also like that bottom has adjustable pieces for height slightly (in case one or 2 legs are on a rug or something and uneven height). Would highly recommend!",

They look like they should be in a child\u2019s room. I kept them because we put them together before I saw how short they are. They are lower than the top of my mattress which looks weird.Also- even though they aren\u2019t difficult to assemble, it was time consuming. I have a hard time believing anyone could assemble two of these in under a couple of hours.",

                "reviewText": "I've gotten a few furniture pieces on Amazon and been pleasantly surprised by the quality but these are so cheap. The holes are drilled too small so the wood splits. After putting it together on carpet it was covered in chipped edges. One of the handles was stripped so the screw won't tighten. The drawers also do not stay level when pulled out. Would not recommend",
