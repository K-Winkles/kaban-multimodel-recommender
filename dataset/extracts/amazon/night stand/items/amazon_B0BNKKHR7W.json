I tried unplugging the whole table and plugging it back in, nothing. The little green light that indicates if it\u2019s on or not was very faint and flickered a bit. I left it unplugged for at least 8 hours while I was at work. Came back home, plugged it back in and the green light is on, not faint or flickering this time but the USB ports still don\u2019t work.

The lamp I have is one of those small Ikea LED stick lamps so the base of it is super tiny, I don't think I would have gotten all that stuff on there if it was a normal sized bedside lamp though. It could use a drawer of some kind, that would be nice, but it does have a bottom shelf.",
