It doesn't look cheap, and it doesn't feel cheap. The rods and frames are actually metal and not plastic, so that's quality. As for assembling? One of the easiest product I've ever had to assemble. Took me probably less than 10 minutes, and I'm no genius when it comes to buidling anything. Lastly, I did buy this during Cyber Monday, but honestly the full price for it is more than fair I'd say. I do wish it was just a bit larger, but eh not the end of the world. I reckon I'll be keeping this little stand for many years.",
