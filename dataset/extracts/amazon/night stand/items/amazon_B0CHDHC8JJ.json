                "reviewText": "I ordered this nightstand to go with the 8 drawer matching dresser (bought first). Really like the addition and my room looks great. It was really easy assembling the 2 drawers, just like its sister dresser was. My space is small (entire apt 497 square feet) so the bedroom is not overwhelmed with regular furniture store which is heavier and bulky. The two shelves are of real wood (like the dresser) and frame is steel (like the dresser). I have had great compliments about both. The chocolate brown color is gorgeous. (Comes in white for those that like the style and cost). One thing that occurred to me is that the furniture made like this is more practical if your budget is really limited. I also like the fact that it is easier to move around (used furniture sliders for carpet), and when it comes time to move to a bigger place, this and its sister dresser will be easier for me to move (lift). Quality is good and shipping was fast. I plan to add more pieces for my TV etc., and like its functionality for me. Highly recommend.",

The main issue with this nightstand is that it is not easy to pull in and out, making it a complete hassle to use on a daily basis.The drawers are poorly designed and do not slide smoothly. I found myself having to use excessive force to pull the drawers out, which often resulted in them getting stuck or jammed. This made accessing my belongings extremely frustrating, and I ended up having to switch to another nightstand altogether.Overall, I would not recommend the Furologee Nightstand to anyone. It is not worth the money or the hassle. Save yourself the trouble and invest in a better-quality nightstand that is easier to use and built to last.",
