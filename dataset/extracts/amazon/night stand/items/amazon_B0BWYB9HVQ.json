It\u2019s the perfect height and just lots of storage. The drawers have a nice pleather finish on the front to make them look fancier than just a regular fabric drawer. The handles are a tan plastic but from a distance looks nice almost like a gold accent. The drawers open easily and hold a lot. The top shelf is a little smaller than I\u2019d hope for but the second shelf and then the drawers make up for it. Very easy to put together, maybe took 20 minutes, and came with all the tools needed.",

The only thing lacking was the pull handles for the drawers (made from cheap plastic). I simply replaced those with metal pulls of my choice. Overall great value!",

Love the look, sturdy frame, easy to assemble, comes complete with tool, and extra hardware in case you lose a bolt or screw. A simple to follow diagram. Just have to make sure the little drawer back stop is in the back on both pieces of frame work. The fabric drawers are great for storage of lighter weight items. For the price, a great item.",

                "reviewText": "First mistake that I keep making and then somehow forget, I search for a tall nightstand. Amazon search doesn't weed out ones that do not fit in the search terms, to get you to buy. I am the fool that bought.Second, I over estimate humans. I think their business ethics would prevent them from selling white trash stuff. The price is low but I have seen particle board things that are low price.Mine did not come with instructions, and I haven't assembled it yet. The hardware is marked with letters so I'm hoping that's enough. I do wish every thing that came with a users manual or instructions always included a link on the product page, to a printable manual or instructions.The drawers are made of some sort of synthetic forever chemical fabric and they unfold to open, much like a large purse or canvas bag. The frame is indeed metal and the top is particle board.A crafty person could save all their cardboard boxers and craft a equally strong and aesthetically pleasing night stand, even without the metal frame. Will I have finally learned my lesson to not trust Amazon's search results. Stay tuned to find out. dun dun dunnnnUpdate. I assembled it and it is a tall night stand. It's about 10\" taller than standard old fashioned night stands that I would have to reach downward a bit, to reach.",

                "reviewText": "I was almost done putting the dresser together when I noticed one of the screw holes was not drilled on one side of the wood. No big deal. I can drill it in. Then I realized the racks that hold the drawers were welded BACKWARDS, rendering the whole thing useless. Disappointed.-------UPDATEFurnulem customer support reached out and sent me a replacement. I was very impressed with their customer service.Once I was able to actually put the dresser together, I was very impressed by the quality. The drawers are fabric, which makes them easy to put together and slide out. It is very stable so I don't anticipate any issue with it breaking.Overall I would recommend this product if you need a nice little night stand.",
