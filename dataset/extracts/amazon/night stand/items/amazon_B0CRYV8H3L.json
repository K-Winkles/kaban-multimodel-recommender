The instructions were clear and easy to follow. All hardware was included, and it even included a screwdriver! Two in fact. It took me about 2 hours to put both together, but again, I'm not the best at these things. But when together they are heavy and very sturdy. They are nice looking though they are laminate and metal. For the price, you can't beat these end tables. Plus, I'm pleased I didn't have to ask for help putting them together! Yay for me.",
