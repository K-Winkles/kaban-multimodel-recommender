                "reviewText": "So here\u2019s the thing- I too read reviews of over tightening and cracking and thought \u201cwell, that won\u2019t be me, I\u2019ve built crappy furniture before, I know not to over tighten\u201d. Well my friends, you haven\u2019t built furniture this crappy.They really set you up for failure in step 1, which is the beauty of it, but you won\u2019t find out until you flip the unit over in step 12. As you can see there are 2 styles of bolt included, Parts B and Parts H. You\u2019ll notice in the directions and product list, Part H isn\u2019t *actually* listed or used at all. In reality, Hs are slightly shorter than Bs- why does this matter? Well, if you use the Bs in step 1, AS INSTRUCTED TO DO, the tops of your nightstands will crack. Regardless of how hard you tighten, there will also be a gap between the leg and the table top because they\u2019re TOO LONG. I\u2019m assuming this is why they included the Hs, but made no mention of when or how to use them ever.So now I have a cracked and ruined product, because of the manufacturer\u2019s own negligence. Don\u2019t buy, but if you do, measure all part before beginning, formulate your own directions, and proceed with loads of caution.",
