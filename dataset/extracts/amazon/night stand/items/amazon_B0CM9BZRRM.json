I currently don't have a player, but I'm getting one, and this stand will be perfect to display my new vinyl collection. The bottom shelf has plenty of storage for records with its two partitions that keep your records from falling over. It includes power which is great so you can plug your player directly in. The two USB plugs in addition to the two regular plugs allow you to charge a plethora of devices. The packaging it arrived in was great, assembly had clear instructions, and all the required tools. It only took me about 30 minutes to assemble this stand and it's super sturdy. If you want a stand alone place to display your music collection buy this, I'm glad I did!",

                "reviewText": "I recently got a record player for Christmas, which I have wanted for a long time. The only issue I had was that I had no where to put it. This table definitely solved that problem for me. My room is very tiny so space for a large table was not an option. I looked for a very specific table with the correct dimensions and this table checked off everything on the list. It fits perfectly in my room, holds all my records and books with room to spare, the little shelf gives me space to place some knick knacks I had around my room, and the plug works perfectly. It was super easy to build and the price was very fair. Definitely was worth the buy!",

I use it to place my diffuser because it comes with a charging station.I also like the depth of the shelves where I can place my oversized books. The U-shape dividers on the bottom shelf is removable so it becomes an open shelf, with cute side mesh rails (see photos and video).This stand was easy to assemble, it only took me about 30 minutes and all tools are provided. If you\u2019re looking for a functional compact side table, I definitely recommend this item.",
