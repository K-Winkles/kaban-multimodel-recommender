The size is smaller than I expected but that\u2019s my bad for not paying closer attention to the dimensions. Easy to put together the instructions were nice. Didn\u2019t take long at all. They are cute and look exactly like the photo. Nice color as well. I purchased these are end tables to go with new furniture I purchased and I don\u2019t have that all set up yet so the end result is yet to be seen but I will say the lamp I have on here makes them look very small. I\u2019ll need to get smaller lamp shades because it is almost equal to the size of the table top. You\u2019ll need something heavy on the bottom shelf of these to keep them from easily moving.

                "reviewText": "I have purchased furniture from Amazon many times. I know it\u2019s cheaper quality but the price and availability has always been a plus side for my family. I have put together several things from Amazon with no issues. These nightstands were so difficult for no reason. Wonky misaligned holes, screws stripes. Overall a battle just to get the pieces to stay upright. They might be cheap but I still feel like I was overcharged for the quality. Very disappointing.",

Would work well next to a bean bag chair to hold a cup and maybe a couple books. Super disappointed but for the price, I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. It did assemble square and didn't fall apart during assembly so that earned it the 2 stars.",
