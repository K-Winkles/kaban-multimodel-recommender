She loves the ability to change the colors in the LEDs and the control the brightness. The extra plugs on top of the stand and USB ports made it very easy and convenient to charge her phone and laptop. Construction was easy and the night stand is very sturdy. It a good size for her room and the drawers are great for extra storage. The only thing that wasn't completely clear was the construction of the drawers. The drawers are NOT made of wood. They are like those collapsible fabric storage cubes. Wasn't expecting that, but the construction is solid enough to provide an adequate structure. They work just fine.",

Tall enough to pair well with her bed and the beat features is definitely the ability to be able to directly plug in your electronics to the top of the table and not have to be moving furniture to search for a wall outlet. Also the LED color changing lights are great for ambiance or as a night light if your kids are younger. The nightstand was really easy to assemble I had my daughter help. The drawers are fabric so I am not sure it would hold anything too heavy but we have toys and books in there and it has done just fine. You can't beat the price for what you get with the light and USB ports. Great buy!",

It was super easy to put together, and I love the charging features, and outlet for my lamp. Also, the LED lights are awesome and brings some ambiance to my room! The drawers are great for storing my things I need quick access to. Love it!!! \u2764\ufe0f",

The led also uses one of the usb plugs on top. Would have been better if it was below, hidden out of sight. Bought a separate cord to do this. Hoping the top surface of the nightstand is hard enough. Seems like it could be damaged easily.",

The whole thing is on the smaller side but it\u2019s very cute and super convenient that it has plug ins on the top. It was very easy to assemble too, I did it in maybe 30 minutes max. My lights ended up not working for some reason but since those weren\u2019t my main interest I didn\u2019t really care too much about it. Overall a very cute and small nightstand.",
