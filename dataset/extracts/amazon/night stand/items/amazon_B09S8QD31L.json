They're pretty small but the drawer holds a lot and slides pretty easily too, even without slide rails. The legs have adjustable feet to level out any flooring divets and prevent any annoying wobble. These are very sturdy! Very good value for an inexpensive pair of night stands that perfectly fit my small bedroom and look great!",

I just love these tables, but have it be just a little taller and a little bit bigger would be nice. Other than that, they are totally worth their money. I also love that you can buy them in a set.",

This table is beautiful and substantial, no movement at all when the printer is operating. The top is big enough to hold the printer with no problem. We store a large amount of printer paper in the drawer, making it very convenient. Very well made and a nice addition to the home office. The drawer is very deep so this table would make a great end table also if it needed to be used for that purpose. We are very happy with this table.",
