Nice and sturdy once put together. Plugs work great and charge things in a timely manner. Helped organize some of the chaos. I would recommend an electric screw driver to put this together as the tools that come with it will leave your hands TIRED! The only con in my opinion is how you can see the large metal head of the screws all over the stand",

Easy assembly however, the knob wouldn't screw on with the screw supplied and it shows the hardware on the top of the nightstand which doesn't show as pictured. Overall pretty sturdy and had to disassemble to adjust the legs where the drawer is to fit with easy as it wouldnt push in evenly at first this I believe was user error turned to tightly. once adjusted draw moves with ease. suitable for my child's bedroom. Looks good! And love the built in plug. Ok for the price just wish the screws were hidden. fits perfectly with the small amount of room we had.",
