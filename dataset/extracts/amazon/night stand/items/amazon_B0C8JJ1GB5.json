The tables ship in smaller boxes and are a cinch to assemble. Instructions are fairly easy to follow, and all of the hardware matched well with the pre drilled holes. Everything tightened together snugly. The sturdiness is pretty solid. These end tables are used for table lamps and light book storage mainly. I would discourage placing beverages directly on the table top. Coasters are definitely encouraged. Power strip and charging station work as advertised. I am satisfied with the value and overall performance of my purchase.",
