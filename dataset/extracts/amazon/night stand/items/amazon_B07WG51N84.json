I have trouble finding nightstands that are multipurpose and also not super tall. If you want a taller one, you can certainly stack these together because their price is great too. It's not like you will be breaking the bank if you buy two sets of them. It's a very natural light wood color that goes with a lot of different prints, styles, and rooms. For the price, I feel like this was a steal. It's very sturdy and is such a step up from all the particle board stuff you see for sale.",

                "reviewText": "Yes these nightstand/end tables are very short (check measurements before buying), but they work for a bed that has no box spring and is naturally lower to the ground. You can always stack them to get more height but we liked them just the way they were in their single fashion.The tables did not come with instructions but they were very easy to put together. It took me about 10 minutes to complete each table. They are slightly wobbly but that doesn't bother me. The bamboo is a nice color and quality. The bamboo has a good weight to it making it seem more expensive then the cost. I would highly recommend the tables as they are a good price for the quality you get.On a side note, the nightstands do match the Zinus Paul bedframe: https://www.amazon.com/Zinus-Sonoma-Metal-Platform-Support/dp/B06WWF1RLF/ref=sr_1_49?keywords=wood+bedframe+zinus&qid=1575888933&sr=8-49",

                "reviewText": "Super cute! Lightweight, attractive design, endless uses. \u2014 The first thing I did was lay out all the different sections into the two separate tables to bigger top and bottom of the table, the sides and two legs for each, and then discovered their leg pads in the envelope so the first actual construction I did was to apply the Leg pads\u2026 BUT: Noticed only after applying for to one of the sets of legs that there were only six pads and the envelope. Had I known that to begin with? I think I would have cut them in half so there were enough to go around.Assembling the table: The two larger segments that belong for the top of the table, and then the bottom of the table that creates the shelf in between, the holes drilled, have a distinct difference that lets you know which side to screw the screws into. There\u2019s a divot that is to hold the screw head on one side and the hole is not that way on the other side. There are similar distinctions on every piece of wood to show which side you want to have facing out invisible are you as you use the finish table and which side you want facing in or which side the screw should be entered into. Just check that out closely. Be sure the four small holes in the end pieces are facing out to attach the legs there. - Down side: after several weeks of use, I can see that the tabletop blemishes easily from drinking glasses on the surface just about anything that you would normally put on a table can easily make a scratch mark in it. The scratch mark comes out, kind of like a gray line and from putting glasses of water or coffee or wine or whatever on the table top it makes these whitish rings as you can see in the last photo. - be sure to to screw the top screws in tightly enough so that the table doesn\u2019t wobble.",
