I have been using one of those folding tables you eat on for like a TV dinner (yeah, they are old school). This is a perfect replacement due to it being smaller in size and not taking up as much room (we live in a tiny house so smaller items are better). It has 3 shelves and a fabric drawer. I do not mind the fabric drawers as these are a lot sturdier than they appear to be. The stand was super easy to put together and they include all the screws/tools necessary to do so! I also love the fact that it has a charging station, giving you more ways to charge or plug-in items that do not require a lot of electric draw. It does not appear to be made of real wood, but laminated, which is fine. It also comes with a small, cute microfiber cloth!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars All Sides and Bottom of the Drawer Are Fabric in this 26\u201d (not 23.4\u201d) Tall Metal and MDF Table",
                "reviewText": "This metal and \u201cwood\u201d table has wood pieces that look nice enough but that are thinly laminated MDF board which is easier to damage than solid wood and harder to fix if it becomes scratched. The metal pieces seem more than strong enough for a small table or nightstand. The electronic panel and cord are higher quality than might be expected. All the parts are organized and labelled with small parts in bags labelled A1-A7; however, there was no A4 bag, leading me to think it was missing until I saw that A4 referred to 2 screws used to attach the drawer handle which were in the A5 bag with the handle. Having checked inventory, it was a straightforward process to follow the 2-page, 9-step instruction sheet, using the two Allen wrenches provided, except for attaching the power module to the front panel: This required putting two short wood screws into the MDF board with no predrilled holes. I did get one of the A7 screws in with my own Philips screwdriver, but it wasn\u2019t easy and not perfectly straight. The second one seemed even more difficult, so I decided to drill a small starter hole for this screw. I also used a cordless drill for the twelve 2\u201d A1 screws, thereby saving some effort and time. When I saw the description \u201cfabric drawer,\u201d I honestly did not expect the entire drawer to be fabric, but that it had a fabric or fabric-look front. In fact, it\u2019s fabric on a frame, including the bottom so it can\u2019t hold a lot of weight. After assembly I was not disappointed with this small, inexpensive table, although it almost did not fit in the intended space because, at 11.7\"D x 15.8\"W x 26.1\"H, it is taller than the dimensions provided on the website (11.7\"D x 15.8\"W x 23.4\"H). As feared, it is unreasonably hard to remove the white stickers that identify the pieces, especially from the wood.",

I like that it has two outlets and two USB A ports for charging my phones, alarm clock and whatever else I comes along. I use the drawer for my medication to keep them away from daylight and dust. The second tier can be used for books and magazines. The wood is sturdy and comes with very clear instructions and all the tools you need to assemble this.The only downside is my unit was missing two pieces on the leg. Otherwise, I like the design. And it fits with the decor in my apartment.",

                "reviewText": "This nightstand was pretty easy to assemble by myself, it probably took me 30-40 minutes. I was slightly hindered in my assembly because one of my included screws was defective and they only included the exact number needed, but I had an extra screw in my tool box from some other Amazon furniture that I recently assembled (albeit a black screw instead of silver like the rest of the screws in my kit... but it works and isn't a spot that is visible so I didn't knock a star for this).I got this for our bedroom to hold our Vick's vaporizer. We've been using a wooden folding TV tray, which works but isn't the sturdiest or most visually appealing solution. The dimensions of this stand were perfect for the space, so I couldn't pass up on the chance to try it. It fits perfectly and works so much better than the wobbly try. The built in power outlet with USB ports is wonderful- I plug my cellphone in there at night and it works great. We put my partner's Playstation on the shelf above the drawer and it fits perfectly.We're very happy with the nightstand. It is attractive, sturdy, and has improved the functionality of our room. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.",

This table is pretty easy to put together, but the instructions should point out that the screws for the drawer handle are in the bag with the handle. That said, this is not the fanciest table, but it is designed well with solid materials, and looks nice. I'm able to use it to place drinks when I'm on the couch and have room for a small lamp for ambiance. The power station is great for extending and consolidating cords and making it easy to charge a phone and tablet at the same time and same place. The drawer is also great for storing things close to the couch but hiding them away to help cut back the clutter.",

It\u2019s the perfect height to use as an end table with easy access to the charging cables. Putting it together was extremely easy to do. Unfortunately, I didn't get all the screws needed. Specifically, one of the two A4 screws that holds the drawers handle was completely flat and had no serration like the other one did. There wasn't any extra either, so as of now the drawer has no handle.The color is nice, but the wood is easy to scratch or scuff. Overall, it feels sturdy. The charging ports are conveniently located, and the smaller size is perfect for living room.",
