                "reviewText": "An upcoming bedroom redo is happing here in a little bit and I got these to go on either side of the bed. I like their simplicity and size. However, on one of the top pieces, an entire side was missing the inner metal parts and I didn't realize this as I was screwing in the screws. When I went to move the piece to screw in the other side the screws stripped entirely out. I had to apply a very strong glue in the holes and reinsert the screws. I finished the table and tipped it upside down on some cardboard overnight to let the glue dry. This worked, but I will still be using the sides to move the nightstand when I pick it up.Be careful not to over tighten the middle shelf install--this is way too easy to do. The drawer hardware takes some time to install as it wiggles easily. After a little while, it gets tighten. I found putting the screws in and lightly screwing them into the handle then gently putting the handle flush with the drawer face while tightening the screws worked best.Overall, these look nice and they are now held together efficiently. I think they will look good on either side of the bed. However, since the top piece is missing a vital part to help with stability and the build I had to take off 2 stars. I shouldn't have to glue brand new furniture because it came with missing parts.",
