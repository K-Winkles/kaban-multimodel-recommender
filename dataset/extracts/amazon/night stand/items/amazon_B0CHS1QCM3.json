For a nightstand that small and at that price point, I did not expect to have to put together so much of it.If you have not started putting it together yet, please note that you should have a cloth or papertowels around to wipe your hands with because one step involves separating the track mechanism, which is coated in lubricant to keep the tracks running smoothly. There is no way to do this without getting the grease/lubricant on your hands and it's a pain in the butt to remove.That said, despite the million steps of putting it together, it looks nice and is sturdy, of good quality, and fits the aesthetic of my bedroom. I have a small bedroom but a kingsized bed so a small nightstand is essential and having one that has a powerstrip in it is really nice.",

                "reviewText": "This is not the first time I have assembled furniture, but I would highly suggest that you use a drill even though the instructions state not too. I struggled to understand the instructions regarding the drawer mechanism and looked for a video. There were some QR codes on the instructions but that led me nowhere. So I searched youtube and found a couple videos. They weren't my exact piece but enough to show what I couldn't understand. Both videos showed the guys using drill. Man I wish I would have. By the time I finished my hand had blisters and was sore. I was not able to complete the assembly in 60 minutes.There were some good points. The hardward and pieces were pretty good quality. As well as these were shipped there was a marred corner, but I was able to hide. Also, while I was screwing in the A screws my hand slipped and broke the board, but I tried again, and it did manage to screw in securely.In prepping for assembly I did count all the hardware and checked the pieces. I thought there was the correct amout of E screws but the last stem I was short 1. Luckily there is a small bag of spare parts, I should give a star just for that.Finally complete. Yes it looks like the product description. It will work for what the intended purchase was. A bedside table, although I will need to be careful, so I don't tip it over. Those high spindle straight legs aren't wobbly but don't give much stability to it either. I might take some double stick tape and stick it to the wall.I'm not sure that it's worth the price? It's not a rip off but try to get it when there is a discount.",

It's a little smaller than I pictured, and the assembly was a little painful. Probable took me about an hour to assemble while I watched some TV. Overall I'm happy with this purchase, but it won't exactly knock anybody's socks off, either. Solid 4 stars.",

The instructions are well written and the kit is well designed, and includes the necessary tools (Philips screw driver and hex/allen wrench).Assembly does take some time, it\u2019s not a 15minute project, but once complete it is solid and looks good.The drawers are tall enough for a tissue box, and even fit a resmed airsense cpap machine.It\u2019s lightweight, so is easily moved, but that does mean that it\u2019s also easily bumped, which may topple things on top. The drawers have a little resistance at the end to keep them in, but it require enough force to push the table a bit as well. I expect that to wear in and not be a problem long term, but it\u2019s simply a lightweight piece of furniture.The wood appears coated with plastic, so it may survive water without the bubbling typical of this type of furniture.",

                "reviewText": "I should have looked more closely at the dimensions, but I was paying more attention to the product photos showing this nightstand being as tall or taller than an adult-sized bed. In reality, our bed which is a pretty typical height is significantly taller than this table. It is also tiny in all dimensions making it ideal for a child. We may try to relocate this by something like an Eames chair that is already low. The build quality is pretty good, and the instructions are pretty easy to follow once I figured out the orientation of the panels. The finish is a sparkly white with gold and tax accents. The power bank is a handy addition. This is a good table, and if it was a little larger it could be great.",
