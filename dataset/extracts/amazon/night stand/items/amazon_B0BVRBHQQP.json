Definitely good for furnishing a room on a budget, these are lightweight petite nightstands that look cute and will work fine in a guest room for lighter use.As described, the parts are very well numbered and the assembly was fairly quick and easy to understand. No having to guess what part is what from tiny diagrams. Love that they included a small screwdriver too. One suggestion - grab a flathead screwdriver to tighten the circular metal parts. They don\u2019t tighten fully with the included screwdriver.These aren\u2019t the biggest or sturdiest pieces around, but for the price I am very happy and they are perfect alongside a platform bed.",

                "reviewText": "When I got is little night stand, I opened it and started laying out the parts. All of the assorted hardware were in bags and clearly marked. I started laying out the actual wooden parts and inspecting them. The wood appears to be a partacle board with a veneer or decal on the outside. Still looks nice though. I started looking for markings to identify the parts. Most were marked but there were a few that weren't. There is a drawing in the directions to help identify the parts. For me, the assembly wasn't hard at all. Took me about 30 minutes from start to finish. The night stand comes with a little screwdriver to assemble it but I chose to use my drill with a phillips head bit, being very careful not to strip any of the holes out. I used a regular screwdriver to turn the quarter turn metal fasteners to lock the pieces together. The only problems I saw was that there were a couple of the screws that were unusable. The heads of the screws were damaged when they were made. But, there were extra parts in most of the bags, so not a big deal with having a couple of bad ones. The table is pretty darn sturdy. The only issue I had was with Amazon itself. The nightstand, apparantly, got lost somewhere. Had to wait a given amount of time then reorder. It took 17 days to get it here. But that has nothing to do with the seller or the product itself. All in all, it's a pretty nice nightstand and would buy it again, for sure. I do definitely love the 110v and USB sockets right there on top of the table. Very handy.",
