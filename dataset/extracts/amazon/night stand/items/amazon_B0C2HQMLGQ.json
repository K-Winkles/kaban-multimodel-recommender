Why do the images in the description show all black if that's not what the customer will get. Too much hassle. I'm keeping the junk this time. And I do mean junk. Both wood pieces have a corner chipped and there a bulges you can see in the planks.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this nightstand in black. It\u2019s a pretty good value ($25 currently) for a nightstand. Do be aware that it\u2019s a very basic version of a nightstand. It\u2019s fairly sturdy but still looks a bit on the cheap side. I\u2019d say this is definitely more appropriate for a nursery or maybe child\u2019s room, perhaps an adult who isn\u2019t super concerned with the aesthetics. My big problem is that the drawer is fabric. I saw that in the description but didn\u2019t realize how noticeable it is. What I can say is that building drawers is the bane of my existence so while fabric isn\u2019t my personal preference, it was nice to build. Speaking of the build, this is a notably quicker build than most nightstands (with one or more drawers involved).Overall, this is not a bad nightstand, especially for current price. I\u2019m not a fan of the fabric drawer personally, but that\u2019s my preference. I would recommend if you need something on the cheap and don\u2019t mind a fabric drawer.",
