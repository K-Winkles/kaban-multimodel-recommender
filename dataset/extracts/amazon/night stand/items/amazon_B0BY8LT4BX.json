                "reviewText": "I recently moved into a new apartment and to my dismay, I lost quite a bit of storage in my kitchen. I didn't even have a drawer big enough for my silverware tray. I did quite a bit of searching for a 3 drawer nightstand style furniture piece for kitchen storage. I settled on this and I am glad I did! The 3 drawers provide great storage. It's good quality, sturdy and was pretty easy to put together as long as you take the time to organize all the pieces. They are very well labeled, instructions are clear and it does come with a few extra screws/hardware in case one rolls away during the process!! I love the light wood color and rattan looks nice. They would be great in a bedroom as nightstands, or as a side table by a couch. Anywhere you could use additional storage. My only dislike are the wooden handles....i would prefer if they were metal but those can easily be changed out or spray painted. They would look really good in a matte black or brass coat of spray paint. Overall I am really happy with the quality and value of this item.",

I bought 2 and both assembled very easily with no issues beside one drawer handle missing the pre-drilled holes so I needed to measure and center before screwing in. Instructions were very clear and there was extra hardware for most pieces needed. Drawers don\u2019t open as far as one of the listing photos makes it seem but it\u2019s not an issue. The \u201cnatural\u201d color is spot on and the rattan is perfect!",
