                "reviewText": "This table is a little smaller than I expected it to be, but it would be great in small spaces! I should've checked dimensions better but it'll still work great for it's purpose. It was easy to put together and feels fairly sturdy, although I do have it sitting on carpet which might have an effect on the little wobble I've noticed. The wood looks great and is super cute and works great as a small side table.",
