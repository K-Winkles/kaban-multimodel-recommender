It's the perfect size for a night stand. Well designed, with a shelf and three drawers. The fabric drawers are a lot sturdier than I had expected. Excellent value, my wife and I are on a very low fixed income and affordability is a big factor in all our purchase decisions.When I placed it by my wife's bed she said \"Now that's a nice piece of furniture.",

But I was completely wrong, nothing moves when pulling a drawer! Easy to assemble, high quality and plenty of space! The added electrical ports were a great touch. The touch of wood and fabric is what makes these drawers pretty good looking.One man job to put together, I highly recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "Love this nightstand overall! Fantastic piece to give some character to my college apartment bedroom.Assembly was smooth and easy, and it all looks and feels solid. The wood panels especially look very sharp (and slightly darker than they appeared online but I actually think they look like higher quality IRL than they do in the pictures). The power port functions and is so convenient! The drawers are thin and light but quite sturdy, I\u2019m able to store plenty of office supplies, cleaning supplies, etc. Yes, it\u2019s smaller than it looks in pictures online, but the product dimensions listed online are accurate, so just look to those if you\u2019re curious about the true size.Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that when attaching the base frame pieces (5 and 6) to the top frame pieces (3 and 4), the instructions said to insert screws to hold the pieces together, but the \u201cscrew holes\u201d are not threaded holes, they\u2019re just open holes so the screws don\u2019t have anything to thread into. Thankfully it didn\u2019t matter because the base and top frame pieces actually slide together securely and there\u2019s really no way for it to disassemble. Maybe this was just a minor defect with my specific nightstand?All in all, highly recommend this nightstand for the price. 100% worth it!",

Now I did want to have wood bins but that\u2019s not going to happen at this price point. Either way the fabric bins do just fine and the two shelves are nice. I like having a top and bottom layer for more space. It was easy to assemble everything, very clear instructions with labels on each piece and bag. It came with tools as well to assemble it so that\u2019s always a plus. So far very happy with it and love the look of rustic brown wood.",

They give you everything you need to build it, and included spare bolts for that \u201cjust in case\u201d moment that all of us have. Comes in different sizes and colors. We chose the 4 drawer, which is the perfect height for our bed. The drawers concerned me at first, but after putting them together, they turned out to be quite sturdy.
