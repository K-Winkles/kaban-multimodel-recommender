I love the lights on it and how there\u2019s a lot of different storage/organization spaces. The hooks included are great for keeping stuff off the surface as well to help declutter (which was a major issue with my old nightstand) overall pretty good for the price and would definitely recommend. :)",

                "reviewText": "As long as you understand that you're buying dorm room style furniture made from particleboard and not any kind of fine furniture, you'll probably be pleased with this.It took me almost 2 hours to assemble the first one. The second was cut to 1.5 hours since I knew what I was doing then. The instructions (pictorial only) were good, but not great.Every piece fit perfectly where it was supposed to and once completed it seems quite sturdy. I would avoid putting anything heavy on the little raised upper shelf. I left the LED light strips off, as I found them kind of silly.I've had a good quality night stand for years, but once I had to start using a CPAP, it drove me crazy. The CPAP took most of the top of my nightstand, with a hose hanging down in front of the drawers. This inexpensive nightstand - though noticeably smaller than what I had before, is much better. The CPAP fits neatly in the space under the top drawer, the hose comes out the side, and the mask hangs perfectly on one of the hooks off the side. So the top of this night stand neatly holds my books, phone, iPad, glasses, etc., and I have easy access to the drawers because the hose is on the side.",
