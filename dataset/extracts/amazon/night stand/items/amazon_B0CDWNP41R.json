                "reviewText": "You're getting what you see in the description. It's not an heirloom piece of furniture that's going to last 200 years. But it's priced accordingly. And it looks good. Everything about it meets expectations. So no stars will be deducted for build quality. It's fine and as expected.I actually think it looks a little better in person than the pictures. For some reason the proportions of the bottom stand looked off to me in the photos. I really liked the drawer part, but was considering not even installing the bottom brackets. But now that I have it, I think the bottom part looks good. And the balance looks right. I don't know why it looks a bit off to me in the photos.The little plastic hooks do a good job at preventing the drawers from sliding out. So they\u2019re not going to pull out unless you really pull hard and are trying to pull them out.I think the assembly is fairly easy. It's a bit time consuming because of all the screws and pegs, but each individual step is simple. The directions are also good. It's all pictures. Which is the proper way to do it IMO. Written directions just get destroyed by the machine translator and you're left with non-sense that confuses more than helps. TIP: Just align every piece in the same orientation as the photo, and do the step they're showing you. When you do this, these type of directions are SO simple. Time consuming, but simple.",

                "reviewText": "This was a nice addition to the bedroom set. It was super easy to put together, although I did have to use a rubber mallet at times. It came out sturdy and leveled nicely. It was a bit smaller than I had expected it to be. I know one of the pictures shows the measurements, but it still looks super small. I used a pack of cards to help reference that. Still, it does hold s decent amount of things, including on top.I don't know that the price is what I would want to pay for something like this, it is nice, but not that nice. Even so, if the price isn't bothersome to you then this is a nice little addition for any room. May even be perfect for a young kids room as well.",
