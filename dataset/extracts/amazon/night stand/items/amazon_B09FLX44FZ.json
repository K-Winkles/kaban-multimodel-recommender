That worked for me.I think it\u2019s beautiful and stable once you put it all together. It just takes a while to put together because of so many piecesThe shelves are not big enough for a notebook A4 like I imagined and had tried to measure out beforehand. The bottom \u201cwood\u201d pieces of the shelves that are supposed to hold your items are extremely thin and flimsy so don\u2019t expect to put anything heavy. I was very surprised that they were made in such a cheap fashion for the price. To get a better sense, I\u2019m attaching a photo where the fake wood paint came off when I took off a sticker they left on that said made in China, taking off both stickers left white spots lol. But it\u2019s not too big of a deal since we hardly see what the bottom of a shelf looks like.I like it still but I would price it closer to $30-35 lol.",
