Other than that these are amazing and the drawers are bigger than expected.There was a small issue with the top of one of the nightstands, but the customer service was AMAZING and they are sending me a new top piece.Very satisfied. Thank you!",

Here are the issues:- sawdust everywhere, in the box and when I put the item together (had to wipe pieces down with a cloth multiple times during assembly)- stripped hole, screw will not go in- uneven legs (the table rocks)- 2 side drawer pieces are the wrong color (a light blue tint)- 1 inner rail piece is missing, making the item unusable- chips in 3 different locations on the items- black paint/metal chipped off the leg while I was assembling it- lousy instructions- had to redo the inner rail position 3 times to get the drawers flush- had to google instructions on how to remove the inner rail pieceI have never had a worse experience, and I am pretty forgiving when it comes to stuff like this. But this long list shouldn\u2019t have happened at $30, much less at $150.Do not buy these tables.",
