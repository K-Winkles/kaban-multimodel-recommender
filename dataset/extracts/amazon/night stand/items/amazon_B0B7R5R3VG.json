                "reviewText": "Hopefully this review helps someone as I don't do these often. I'll begin with the good parts. Item is nice and sturdy, easy to build as well. It seems a little smaller than expected but is great as a nightstand to hold small items possibly underwear and socks. The color is really sleek and no parts were missing. Now for the negatives. First and foremost the seller sent the incorrect lights, as it is only 3 different shades of white and not an RGB colored strip. They did send out a correct strip after the fact. My biggest concern is it stated in the description that there is an outlet to plug in chargers and such, there is none. After I brought this to their attention, the seller was really helpful and refunded my money from the purchase. I like the stand, but was greatly disappointed that it did not actually include an outlet.",
