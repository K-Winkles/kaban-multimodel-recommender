This was a pretty difficult build, but once I had it together it was a solid, aesthetically pleasing, compact nightstand. The LED is ok but the built in charger and accessories outlet is awesome. I recommend this item.",

Target, IKEA, etc. had nightstands but they were more expensive. We wanted something compact with a lot of storage. These nightstands are a decent size and look good in our bedroom. The LED lights are nice and there is a lot of space in the drawers. Not bad for the price.",

They bring a lot of pieces and a lot of hardware to put together. Instructions are clear, but it will take you a while to put them together. Quality is definitely not the best, but they seem to be durable after, three weeks of use. One thing to note is that the LED light will need to be plugged into one of the USB ports on the top, making it visible from the top. I decided not to use the LED in my case so I could use both USB charging ports.",

Instructions are extremely easy to follow, just make sure you follow them exactly as shown in the figure. (Put the screws in the right holes or else you'll end up with a lopsided drawer and spend hours figuring out why.) Other than that the assembly process was very easy and straightforward. The drawers are perfectly lined up and they open/close smoothly. Upper drawer is perfect for storing small items no bigger than an inch in height. Wireless charging very convenient if you want less wires in your room. The led lights are a perfect touch for modernizing your room. This is absolutely a perfect night stand! Totally recommend it- 10/10",
