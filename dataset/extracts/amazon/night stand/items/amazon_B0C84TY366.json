Listed my pors/cons about the item below:Pros:- Great value for a set of 2 night stands- Built in USB charger ports for convenience- Plenty of drawers/shelves for organization- Easy to assemble, it took me about an hour to build both, with no issuesCons:- Drawers are not on a rail system so they feel a little clunky when being used- Nightstand is a bit small (which worked for me) but may not work for everyone -- check the item dims before you purchase- No tools are provided so make sure you have you own philips & flat head screw driver or drill handy",

Plus the led lights are a total scam. To sticky light strips are what you get plus a \"control\" that you have to put it inches away for it to work, if it even decides too. It took hours to put together to only be completely disappointed. Tipped over when a child's lamp was put on top. Do not make the mistake that I did by ignoring the bad reviews and giving it a chance.",
