                "reviewText": "These nightstands were not difficult to put together, in my opinion. I thought they might be TOO small in height once I opened the box, but once it was put together they ended up to be the PERFECT height to my bed. I have a king size platform bed and 12\" mattress and because the nightstands dont take up much room on either side, I still have access to my dresser on one side or my sitting chair on the other with no issues. I love that there is power included! 2 regular outlets and 2 USB spots?!? Its just awesome! The power cord itself is long, but I didnt need to even use all of it. It is a pretty nice length though. The two fabric drawers underneath have a metal type handle, are pretty sturdy, and hold more than you might think. They slide easily as well. It comes with 2 s-hooks for use on the side. I personally dont use them, but you may find a use for them...either on the nightstand or elsewhere. The nightstands dont have a cheap look to them either, so I would definitely recommend them!!",
