                "reviewText": "Before purchasing, I saw that other people were not too happy about the fabric drawer. I thought this meant that the drawer had fabric lining, but no -- the drawer is made out of fabric completely (except for the front, which is wood). The legs are made out of metal, which surprised me (I was again expecting wood or partical board). The top of the end table is wood, as is the bottom shelf, and the front of the drawer. I can't imagine this will last very long, so don't buy it if you want a lasting piece of furniture.",

Not impressed with the cloth drawer, but other than that it feels sturdy. She really just needs the top for a small lamp and her water bottle, so it definitely works perfectly for that!",
