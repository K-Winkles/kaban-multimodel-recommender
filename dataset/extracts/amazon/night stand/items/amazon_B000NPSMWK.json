The table itself is very sturdy but I haven\u2019t put anything in the drawer yet to know how that is. It was easy to assemble but for convenience & ease it is better to have two people.I did contact the mfgr bec the screws seemed way too bi(fat) for the holes & I didn\u2019t want to split the wood. He was Very helpful and had me measure the hole stating the size it was supposed to be which it was. He assured me that if we had trouble they would work w/ us in getting a new piece. The screws Did work without a problem, they were just very snug.Others complained about differentiating between the long & short screws but they are clearly marked in separate pkgs so I\u2019m not sure what the problem was.I would definitely buy another one if I had a place for it.",

I'd recommend putting in the long screws using an electric screwdriver with an allen head fitting. Otherwise wear a glove on your dominant hand because getting the screws in with the included allen wrench are tough! But at least you know they're not coming loose any time soon.Very nice end table for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For $40 I was not expecting this great quality of a night stand. Although, there was a struggle putting it all together once I realized the holes made on each peace of wood were way smaller for the screws. Since I didn\u2019t have my tools at the time, I had to use what I had close by which were a pair of scissors that I used to carve the holes larger to be able to make it work. Besides the struggle, I was happy with the result, and the night stand looks just as shown. It is very durable, the drawer was spacious, and it was not heavy to move around.If you are trying to save your troubles of building an IKEA night stand and the money, this is a great alternative for such a great price!",

Not like it'll be holding all that much, so time will tell on how that holds up.Assembly was annoying as the hardware wasn't well-labeled. The short and long screws are difficult to distinguish, and I accidentally used a long screw to secure the top which caused it to almost poke through the surface (there's a little raised blemish from that on the first unit).When assembling, make sure you have a ratchet, extension, and hex bit - especially if you're assembling more than one. I assembled both using the included allen wrench, and my hands were nearly bleeding by the time I was done.",

                "reviewText": "This item\u2019s description needs to be changed to reflect the fact that this item is absolutely NOT a Walnut finish. It is clearly and very obviously Redwood. This is proved by my needing to use a furniture pen to fill in a couple of scratches and only the Redwood pen matched. In my situation, that is not a fatal flaw to my use of it but it certainly could be for others who are trying to coordinate with existing furniture.Despite have a lot of experience putting furniture together, this was not easy for all the reasons many others have listed. It arrived well packed and protected in the box. Each main piece was wrapped separately. All needed parts and pieces were included. Instructions were limited but sufficient. The difficulty I experienced related to the poor fit of the hardware to the main pieces as well the need to use some of my own tools instead of the miniature versions that were supplied. It was a laborious process due to the difficulty with making enough adjustments so that the hardware actually performs the function it was intended to perform. The small decorative covers for the screw holes did not fit without a bit of sanding and the use of Elmer's glue. The wobbly drawer is not a problem for me since I am not intending to use it but it may be a problem for others. The table itself is quite sturdy once it is finished and the size is exactly what I needed. The description for this table needs to be revised to reflect the actual item received, particularly the color.",
