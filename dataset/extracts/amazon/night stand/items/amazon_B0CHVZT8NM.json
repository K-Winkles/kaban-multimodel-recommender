It's big enough/tall enough to put my robot vacuum under, which was something I wanted but wasn't sure I'd get.The drawers are much shallower than they look. They seem decently large from the front, but the drawer behind the facade has just under 3 inches of depth. I'd prefer a more efficient use of space.Still, it's not bad and I like the design. It's useful to have a charging station beneath the surface where we actually put stuff.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to match what I would call the light oak headboard. Maybe a pine. The color came in more gray than I expected. And didn\u2019t match the bed I wanted to pair it with. I got approval to return it because it was never out of the box. I literally open the box all the color of the wood seal it back up to return.. I went to the ISPS to return it and it was gonna be $65 in shipping to return the product. Since I never put the product together, I can\u2019t testify as to its quality. But if you have any hesitation about color match, do not buy this nightstand.",

I like the droor that opens to keep my medications out of sight. The light makes for a cool nightlight. You can change colors to suit your mood. The doors open and close just fine. I like it, recommended.",

Lots of cool functions with the lights too and I can even control it with my phone.My one and only issue is that the two top drawers don't close flush with the table after I put it together. Could be operator error, but I followed the instructions. However, it's not enough of a gap for me to worry about.",
