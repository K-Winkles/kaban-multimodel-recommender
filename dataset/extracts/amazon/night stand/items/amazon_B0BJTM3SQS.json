                "reviewText": "I must admit I didn't have high expectations for these nightstands, but after assembly, I was surprised at how sturdy they were. I am always hesitant to order furniture like this as they usually get banged up during shipping. The package arrived in a simple brown cardboard box that was securely taped shut with no damage to the box (ie bashed and crumpled corners. Upon unpacking the contents, I was impressed at how well everything was packed. The corner edges of the box were reinforced with heavy cardboard corners which protected the contents very well. Assembly took about an hour for the first nightstand, but I took my time, took inventory of all the parts, and reviewed the instructions carefully before attempting to assemble. All of the hardware was well organized as each group of parts came in their own small baggy and labeled with a numeric sticker. Everything came together easily with a small allen wrench and a phillips screwdriver that were included which was really nice. Some of the screws tapped into the particle board easily, but be sure to take your time to make sure that the screws are aligned and straight with the pre-drilled holes. I was able to put second nightstand together in about 30 mins since I was already familiar with the assembly process.One minor issue I had with the first nightstand was the fit of the hinged metal door. It was a bit snug, but I think I would attribute it to the hinge not fully seated. The screws need to be tightened a seat flush as much as possible. For the second nightstand, I made sure the screws were tight and everything fit just fine.Overall, I am very satisfied with the value and quality of this product and would recommend it.",
