I\u2019m not very good at putting furniture together but I was able to. It comes with a door but it looks just as good without. It\u2019s a very sturdy piece of furniture. Also the company has excellent customer service. There was a problem with fedex and when I sent the company a message at 5am, they replied immediately. WowAdditional review: I had a friend over this weekend. He hadn\u2019t been here since I got the tables. He said they are really nice and how wel they matched my bed and TV stand (well, yeah that\u2019s one reason I got these) and he liked the USB charging ports (well, again, yeah that\u2019s another reason I got them lol)",
