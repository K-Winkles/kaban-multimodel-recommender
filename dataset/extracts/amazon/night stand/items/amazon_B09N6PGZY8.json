                "reviewText": "First off I would like to write how well these night stands were packaged. There was little to no way these would come damaged as there was plenty of styrofoam to protect them in the 2 boxes it came in. Instructions were clear cut as the first night stand took an hour and the second one was done even faster. Spare parts are included in case something happens and the tool it came with is very useful but I used a drill to make things faster and easier.The touch panel for the lighting and motion sensor works perfectly as well as the plug-ins for electronics. Love the lighting as well with 3 different color selections (Blue, Warm, and White) which all three are dimmable. The drawers are noisy but standard. Will consider putting felt underneath as someone suggested on here to help alleviate the noise.",
