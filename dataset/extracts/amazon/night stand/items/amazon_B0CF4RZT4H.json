The drawer has lots of space and is able to fit everything I need it to. I love the compartment underneath to store extra blankets and hide my extension cords. My only complaint was that assembly took a lot longer than initially expected and the kit didn't include tools to assemble so make sure you have a screwdriver on hand! Overall, I think getting 2 bedside tables for this price is a steal when 1 can cost you upwards of $100. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "So first, let me say that I was a bit nervous about purchasing these but the reviews are some of the most decent I\u2019ve seen for nightstands PLUS I needed 2.Everything was packaged well in the box for both, the instructions were amazing. Like seriously, I got both cabinets together by myself in record time. I actually enjoyed putting them together.Pros: They\u2019re pretty freaking sturdy, caught me by surprise honestly. Assembly was beyond easy, nice color, everything needed was there. The drawers fit correctly which is always a plus.Cons: There isn\u2019t much to say that\u2019s wrong. The back panel for one came chipped in the corner but it wasn\u2019t a big deal for me as it wasn\u2019t a huge chip. Thankfully I have my little handy drill I use (if you\u2019re a woman reading this, don\u2019t be afraid to get a drill. I walked into Home Depot and was like \u201cI need a drill that\u2019s not too heavy or heavy duty but gets jobs done\u201d so if I can do it, so can you), some of the holes were like off in where they were suppose to be. So I\u2019ve had to lightly use my drill to make holes but honestly you can use a screw driver too.Overall, I\u2019m happy with my purchase. I rely heavily on reviews so I felt it was only right to do my part and write one for this.",

It's not only a beautiful addition to her room but also incredibly functional. The drawer and storage shelf provide ample space to keep her bedtime essentials organized, and the sleek white design perfectly matches her decor. As a parent, I appreciate the sturdiness and quality of this nightstand, knowing it will last. It's a perfect fit for a child's bedroom and a great value for the price. I highly recommend this nightstand for anyone looking to enhance their child's bedroom with both style and functionality.",

Its easy to assemble, the only thing is they didnt add instructions telling me to repeat the steps for the other side of the table, and I ended up not placing one of the drawer railings, but its an easy fix. It was also alright because the piece i was sent was defective! Fear not, as they swiftly and professionally handled the situation, sending me a new piece that had the wheel which i needed. Customer service was amazing in handling the issue, they told the manufacturer about the issue and got one headed my way after receiving a photo which confirmed the defect, and the piece which was needed. Overall, pretty damn good. Might want to assemble the stand on a high surface, since you'll be bent over working on it for some while. Hard on the back! The instructions were pretty clear at the very least. Huge thank you to this company!",
