I needed something with a plug since I have a sectional and I need the plug on the table for various machines I need to use. It\u2019s nice to be able to charge my phone and tablets. Nice little drawer. Pretty sturdy. The instructions aren\u2019t bad at all, just take your time and pay attention to the holes. I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This little table was not easy to assemble (at least not for me), but I only had to redo it once, so I guess that's really not too bad. I'm also ticked off because the post office misdelivered the package, and insisted it was in the mailbox; eventually a neighbor dropped it off. That's certainly not the manufacturer's fault, but I wanted to complain to someone. Overall, this is a great little table, and well worth the time to put it together.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased it in July last year, and initially, I was impressed with its sturdiness and secure drawers. The convenience of having four outlets (two USB and two regular) for charging devices was a my most favorite point. However, after just about four months of use, I've encountered a significant issue with the charging capability. Despite using only one USB charger, the charging speed has dramatically decreased. It now takes nearly four to five hours to charge a single phone. I have confirmed that there are no issues with the charging adapter itself. This unexpected decline in performance is disappointing, especially considering the positive experience I had initially.",

Assembly was a bit of a challenge only because the first step is not explained clearly; but if you're a smart person you could tell that it's a box. The other challenge is that there are no dowels to hold pieces in place so if you're not careful you could break the wood while screwing something in. It's definitely not IKEA. The screws and bolts are visibly apparent and are not hidden.The manufacture might have an error in it's process. The first order I had missing bolt insets. These are the metal pieces inside the wood that help bind the bolt frame together. I had to return my order and ordered another one which had no issues.I did not buy this to be a hallmark furniture piece to show off. It's meant to be hidden. It is not fancy.",
