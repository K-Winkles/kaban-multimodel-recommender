I really bought this for the USB and electric outlets on the top and it really keeps my phone and tablet cords more organized and out of the way. It took longer to put together than I liked, but that was not a big deal. I am really happy with this table and would recommend it. It's pretty, compact, and I love having the extra outlets!",

Definitely smaller- if you\u2019re looking for big end tables, look elsewhere- however if you\u2019re looking for space efficient, sturdy and affordable, this is your spot \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

It was pretty easy to follow along the instructions but it still took me about a full 45-60 minutes, it\u2019s super cute and sleek but the only thing someone might be mad at is the screws showing in the four corners on top, doesn\u2019t bug me too much.",

When using the electric screwdriver, be cautious towards the end of screwing to avoid over-tightening and potentially cracking the wood. Pay attention to the sticker positions in the instructions; for instance, if the 'B' sticker is indicated on top, align the piece accordingly when attaching the legs. The side table looks fantastic, fits precisely where intended, and I appreciate the convenient plug and USB at the top. I highly recommend this side table!",
