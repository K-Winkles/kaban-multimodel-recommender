I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t more reviews, but I understand the 4/5 star rating now. It appears more expensive than its actual cost, and despite having no handles, it\u2019s easy to open and close. It\u2019s a great fit for small spaces, making it perfect for smaller rooms. Personally, I\u2019d give it five stars.",

There are no words, just drawings so you need to double check the orientation of all parts because a lot of them look very similar and you may need to disassemble and redo it. But after assembling the product looks very nice. Drawers are more shallow than it looks in the pictures, and sometimes they catch when you pull them out. Not as smooth as my Ikea drawers but can be expected with this price point. I would say purchase if you\u2019re okay with smaller drawers and good at assembling furniture.",
