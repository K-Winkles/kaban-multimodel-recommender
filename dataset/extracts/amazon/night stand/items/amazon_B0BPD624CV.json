If you have cats or intend to really use these tables to hold drinks or anything spill-able, they are not sturdy enough. They are very low-profile, though, and have a nice charging set-up with 2 usb and 2 outlet plugs.Assembly was so easy especially with a drill. Each of them took maybe 10 minutes each with the drill and instructions are relatively straight forward.The lower rating is due to how unstable these are.",

Fine if you are just charging devices and maybe a bottle of water but a lamp takes up too much space.Overall very easy to assemble (about 20-30 mins for both tables) Pretty sturdy as well.",
