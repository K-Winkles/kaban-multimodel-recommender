                "reviewText": "Very simple to put together. All components fit perfectly together with no issues.I love that it has an outlet hidden in the back decently out of sight.The barn style cabinet door really boosts the asthetics, and matches my barn style Tv Stand almost exactly.It also came with a medium/full size screwdriver which is much easier to use than the mini ones normally supplied with other products. Plus its nice to keep around the house for future use.Overall great product. Fairly priced. Would recommend. We shall see how it lasts, but it does seem very sturdy with no weak connections between pieces.Only critique would be that the cabinet door slightly bends when opening due to the super strong magnet holding it shut. But nothing too concerning as it holds its shape. Maybe the magnet should have been desgined to lay behind where the knob is instead of on the top of the cabinet, for smoother functioning.",

Took me an hour to put together because the pre drilled holes did not accept the screws well. It is small and serves the purpose for the guest room. Power cord is a great addition. I have put many different pieces of furniture together this was more difficult to crew together. Has the feel of cube storage with a door.",
