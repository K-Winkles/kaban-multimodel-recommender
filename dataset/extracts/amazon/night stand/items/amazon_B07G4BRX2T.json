                "reviewText": "Building the bookshelf, the metal rods that create the frame were not looking like 60 dollars worth - not flush, and not top quality.. however the bookshelf fully assembled is very sturdy and the frame imperfections are barely noticeable. If you cant see it in the photo.. nobody else will. I forgot about it once I attached the shelves.I needed a bookshelf that will hold binders. I have about 2-3in available above binders on each shelf. All your books can rest on the frame. I hoped to buy something useful for later down the road too. This bookshelf will last.The wood is not real but the stain and wood grain is very pretty. Even comes with a strap to keep attached to the wall. I think it was worth the money, and would buy another.",

When they arrived, two of the shelves had a visible crack on the middle and they were dark brown, not black. It came with a card in the box that said to contact the seller with issues, with directions but the directions didn't work and there wasn't a way to contact them directly. I had to submit an exchange through Amazon and I'm waiting on the replacement tables. Fingers crossed they come without damage and are BLACK, not brown. They look cute and if the replacement comes in correctly I'd recommend. I'd like the option to be able to contact the seller as opposed to having to repackage and drive to the UPS store to return.",

As other reviewers said, they are prettty short to work as a night stand on their own, but they're great storage that fits perfectly under my window in my living room. They also fit records, so I ordered another set to store my record collection, use as a projector stand in my living room, and another to hold some plants. I wouldn't be surpirsed if I end up ordering more in the future, as these tables are super useful.They're pretty simple to put together, my first set had one panel that was a little banged up, but wasn't worth sending it back over.",

When we got the package I didn't think 2 were in it, but it's just cause they were that small. Stacking then just looks stupid, as the legs look weird.The quality was mediocre, but my biggest gripe is that they sent GOLD screws with a black nightstand. You can see every screw on top and the sides. Looks so trashy and cheap! They either need to provide cover up stickers or black screws.We ended up returning these and got something way better for the same price!Don't waste your money, find something better and nicer than these!",

The fit and finish are not flawless but, again, they are inexpensive. I was setting up a new 'reading nook' with a comfy chair and an LED lamp, so I needed a table to support my drink and some books. One of these tables fills that need, while the other is holding some road atlases whose form factor makes them ill-suited to my book cases. All in all, a satisfactory purchase.",
