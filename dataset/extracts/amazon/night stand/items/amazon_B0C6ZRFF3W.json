It was too tall and too short to fill the space leaving a big space . And of course the lock does not work. I will be sending this garbage back",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I wanted a good looking nightstand that gave me a way to charge my phone but was small enough that i didn't try to over-clutter it with random junk. This one seemed to check all the boxes. That said, there were some definitely pros and cons to this particular stand.Pros:1. Size (small, which is what I wanted).2. Power plugs and USB ports are on a shelf below the top. This prevents power cords and outlets from getting in the way of anything I want on top of it (in my case, a lamp and maybe a book).3. Power cord length: The length of the cord coming out the back of the nightstand is a good length to allow it to reach a power outlet without there being too much excess cord.4. The dresser is sturdy once assembled. No wobble or loose parts.Cons:1. On mine, the USB-A ports don't seem to actually charge my phone (haven't tried the USB-C port, since I don't have a cable that fits it). Instead, I just plug my charger directly into one of the available power outlets, which work fine. Not sure if this has something to do with the output rating of the ports, or if the ports are defective.2. While assembly was pretty easy, I had a similar issue to others in that the screw used to attach the handle to the door is a bit short. But by pushing both the handle and screw together pretty hard while I tightened them together, I was able to get the threads to catch and it has held fine since.3. The internal cavity/drawer is just one big space, and that space is shared with the bottom side of the outlet/USB strip mounted on the open shelf. if, like me, you take up the additional slack in the power cord by stuffing it back into the nightstand, it goes right into that space and makes it less useful to store other things. I wish they had designed this a little differently so there was a small cavity for the power cord to was separate from the main storage space.Overall, this does what I need it to do....I just wish it was designed a little differently (and that all my power options worked as they should).Overal",
