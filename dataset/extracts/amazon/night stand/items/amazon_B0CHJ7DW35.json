However, be prepared, the box was heavy. The directions were clear and easy to follow. Installation was quick and easy and it only took me about half an hour to complete by myself. All the pieces needed were there and they even gave extras just in case. The table is small I think for the price, but I suppose its big enough to do what its made for. It's pretty sturdy, but not like a real wood end table. I would be very careful about putting drinks and such on it. Not sure it would hold up well to any type of moisture.",

                "reviewText": "I am using this VASAGLE Farmhouse Nightstand as a nightstand and it looks great next to my bed. Pretty easy to assemble, like any IKEA furniture and it comes with everything you will need within the assembly kit. The detail with this nightstand is wonderful, the shelf area below the table top is a nice storage spot to put the things you would like to get at quickly. The barn door compartment has plenty of space and it\u2019s nice to be able to close the door to help keep the items hidden. I like that you can choose which direction you would like to door to open. Overall, for the price, this is a nice, solid nightstand.",

If I say that it's the best value, I would not feel I'm being honest considering that besides being small, do not offer any other conveniences such as USB ports nor AC outlets. However, once assembled, it looks beautiful! I just love the look of the \"crossed slats\" that characterize farmhouse style furniture.",
