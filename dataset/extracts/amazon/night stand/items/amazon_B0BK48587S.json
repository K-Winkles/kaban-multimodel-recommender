                "reviewText": "This is a nice little nightstand/end table, and it is small. It comes unassembled but all tools necessary to put it together are included; it took me 30 min to put it together, and that includes the time it took to take the stickers off all visible areas. The instructions are almost foolproof; there is one step where if you don\u2019t look carefully at the illustration you will put board 3 on upside down. Assembly is almost completely done using a hex wrench. The grey and black color is nice and blends in well with my decor. The drawer opens and closes surprisingly smoothly and the entire unit is very sturdy. It weighs about 15 lbs and is 23\u201d high by 16-1/2\u201d wide by 12\u201d deep, perfect size for a night table or an end table. Originally I was going to use it as an end table for the couch in my office, but it is the perfect size to fit under my desk and will give me a place to charge my laptop that is out of the way, plus giving me a drawer for \u2019stuff\u2019, something I do not have now.One con on this item: it is made from \u201cMDF\u201d but not what I usually associate MDF with. It looks like large wood fibers were glued together and then a laminate but on the board. When you are putting it together you will hear a sickening \u2018crunch\u2019 as you drive in the screws and it is easy to strip the hole if you are not careful (so do all by hand). My other concern for this wood is, in the past, I have seen it suck up water if it gets in contact with it and fall apart. I don\u2019t know if this will happen here; luckily no wood touches the ground but I would not place this in a damp environment.Overall, I give this 4 stars; as long as you understand what you are getting it is a good deal, since I have seen tables like this go for a lot more that were not as nice.",
