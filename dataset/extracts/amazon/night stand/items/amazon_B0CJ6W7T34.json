Great that my iPad and iPhone can both use the table\u2019s charging function and be conveniently close to my recliner for easy access. I can put my keys, eye glasses, etc in the drawers. I got the set of two tables but I'm using them in different rooms. I have one in a guest bedroom as a bedside table. It's great there for a table lamp and for storage in the drawers, and the power strip is convenient for my guests for charging phones and iPads. The other is being used between two recliners in my den -- and again it's perfect for charging my mobile devices and storing things (like remote controls) in the drawers. The LED lights are also a nice touch to these tables, as they provide nice \"underlighting\" as a nightlight for both rooms.",

                "reviewText": "This was incredibly easy to assemble, so props to this product there. In person, it looks pretty much the same as it does in the listing photos. The one thing it doesn't mention or show, is that in order to use the LED underlight, you actually have to plug it into the USB port on the top of the unit. I really wish it connected either at the bottom or was wired with the main plug.You do get what you pay for with this, it is aluminum, cloth bins, and particle board, so it will be relatively fragile, but if you take good care of it, it's a nice piece that should hold up over time. I'm using mine as an end table in the living room so it's very convenient to have highly accessible plugs and a USB port and I do like its slick design.",

                "reviewText": "Typically I will shy away from online furniture, but in this case I gave it a shot.The wood is particle board and the metal frame is brushed aluminum. That's about what I expected. The screws are sturdy and hold it all in place well without wobbles.Biggest plus here is that the instructions were very clear and well written. That's quite rare for online furniture, so kudos to the manufacturer.My only complaints are that I wish the LED strip could do soft white instead of the more abrasive colors it offers, and that it could somehow plug into the bottom of the power strip rather than needing to hook into the top.I will most likely keep the lights on the white/blue color.The storage is ample and I think it will last for a long time.",

Whole process to assemble took about 30mins for both with very easy to follow instructions. They look better then the photo and are very sturdy to use. The drawers are easy to pull in and out. Holding objects with no issues like bulging or sagging. Great addition to any room.",

                "reviewText": "These were easy to assemble with clear instructions and are lightweight. I got them for the extra outlets and because they matched the rest of the furniture. It has an extra drawer fromy previous one which is always nice. The lights are separate with adhesive but they also have anchors to keep them in place which is good because I had one light strip fall off all the time and that gets irritating. My only complaint is that the outlet area is a bit of an eyesore but given the surface area, I suppose there aren't many options to conceal it. Overall, good nightstand.",
