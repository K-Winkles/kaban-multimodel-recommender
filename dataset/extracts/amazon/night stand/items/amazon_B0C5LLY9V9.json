We used it without the legs but for the price it was perfect! Left a few inches next to the drawers for leggings to fit too!",

The thing that got me the most was that the legs of the table are covered in plastic that looks like wood. They couldn\u2019t even be bothered to stain in. The \u201cwood\u201d on the legs doesn\u2019t match the drawer knobs and makes it look terrible. The knobs are just unstained wood, not white in the picture. The directions are pretty bad also. I\u2019m too busy to send it back but there\u2019s better side tables for the price of this one. I gave it 2 stars because it came with all the pieces and they all fit together correctly.",
