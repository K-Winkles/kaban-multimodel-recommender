The assembly was easy enough and everything went together like it was supposed to with the exception of the top drawer of one of them. It juts out over the edge it\u2019s designated space so it can\u2019t close fully.We triple checked to be sure that we didn\u2019t put a piece on upside down or anything, but it appears to be a matter of some holes being drilled in the wrong place. It\u2019s annoying, but not a deal breaker since it\u2019s in a corner out of sight from casual view.The actual tables are really sturdy and look good. I hate to judge the product based on what was probably just a piece that slipped through quality control when the overall product is so solid and honestly really nice for the relatively low price point, but I figure it should be noted for anyone on the fence about buying them.",

                "reviewText": "I like this side table. Nice and Sturdy. Went thru the directions, put it all together and the top drawer wouldn't close all the way. The bottom drawer was too short. The bottom box that holds the drawers doesn't specify top or bottom. So, we unscrewed the bottom box, rotated it and tested the drawers and they closed completely. So... if you find this to be your problem, the bottom box is most likely installed upside-down. The drawer glides will work either way so no need to remove them. Hope this helps someone.",
