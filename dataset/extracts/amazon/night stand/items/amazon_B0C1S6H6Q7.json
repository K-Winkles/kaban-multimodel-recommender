                "reviewText": "This is a great nightstand. I was shocked at the heavy weight of the box when we received it. With the exception of the backing pieces, everything is sturdy. Technically the pieces are particle board but you'd never know by the weight or surface appearance. They are heavy like real wood and the surfaces have a wood grain texture. The backing pieces are thinner. I was absolutely amazed at how well the assembly process went. Usually when I put together a piece of furniture the drill holes don't line up correctly or some are missing etc. This was perfectly prepared for assembly. All the holes lined up 100% in the correct place. The boards and hardware matched up exactly how it was supposed to. Nothing was missing from the package. And the instructions were crystal clear. It was probably the least frustrating assembly I've ever done on a piece of furniture. I was really impressed. Start to finish it took me about 90 minutes. It's not difficult by any means, there are just a LOT of parts. I highly recommend using a ratcheting screwdriver rather than a regular one. It will save you a ton of time. There is one place on the piece that is slightly damaged as shown in the photo (underneath the table top there is a little wood showing through the paint). That is my only negative. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars The hardware is impossible to use",
                "reviewText": "I've put a lot of furniture together over the years but I don't think I've ever struggled as much as I did with this nightstand. It uses a \"quickfit\" head screw and a cam lock, with instructions to neither over or under tighten the screw. That would be fine except the holes for the screws are sometimes too deep or too shallow and you have to be extremely careful to line up the screw correctly. The bigger challenge, however, was to get the cam-lock to actually lock down the screw. Mine were sliding in and out and once the cam has been inserted, it's impossible to remove it and try again. You also need to be an octopus - you have to hold at least 4 different panels in place simultaneously while trying to get the cam-lock into the best position. The entire thing collapsed onto itself, ripping the screws out of the panels, rendering it impossible to hold together. With no exaggeration, I've never yet assembled anything that has taken me more than an hour at the absolute most, but I finally called it quits after 5 hours of struggling to get everything to fit together. I find it interesting that the variation that I purchased no longer seems to be sold. Knowing there are many other options that take little effort to assemble, I'm going to call this a learning experience and stick to something I know I won't have to work so hard to assemble. It doesn't help that the instructions are all illustrations with no words to support the pictures. That might be fine if only a couple of things needed to be done in each step. But one illustration, for example, had 14 separate pieces of hardware that needed to be inserted/cam-locked. Often it was a challenge to determine which type of hardware went into which hole. I don't recommend this item for people who do not have experience assembling furniture. Even if you do have experience, there are multiple options on Amazon that are a lot easier to assemble, won't cost you more money, and look better when the job is finished. I really wanted this to work, hoping it would replace a nightstand damaged during a move. But this feels so fragile, I'm not sure it would withstand any future moves. I value my own time and hate to waste it on a project that is doomed to failure.",
