                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Super cute and functional nightstand. The three drawers are fairly decent in size and hold a good amount of odds and ends like extra wires, chargers, glasses cases, little trinkets and such.Overall it was fairly easy to assemble. Not super tall but again next to my queen mattress, it is accessible when I need to get my phone or anything while lying down. The charging ports on top were a big selling point for me and I\u2019m very happy with how they work. I have a Bluetooth desk lamp and Mr phone and wireless ear buds all connected and it\u2019s very organized. The LED color backlight comes with s little remote snd it offers s nice mood light at night or the evening when needed.Overall really good value for the money. The night stand is practical with the outlets / USB charger station on top, had three decently sized drawers for those little odds and ends you have in your bedroom. Plus the LED lights and remote are a cool feature that make it standout a bit more.",

I love having all the space on the surface of the nightstand without my cpap taking up space. I enjoy the lights in the shelf. The charging dock on the nightstand works great and is so convenient. The only con that comes to mind is the assembly took nearly an hour. It\u2019s sturdy, functional, and a great value for the price. I highly recommend it.",

Only thing I\u2019d say I didn\u2019t like is how long the cords were, but you could plug it in from quite a distance if that\u2019s your thing, lol. OVERALL: 9.0/10",

It will charge for a few minutes and then quit charging. I probably would not buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Great night table ! Very clear instructions on putting it all together. This was my first time I put together a piece of furniture and for someone who never tempted this because I always saw this as a complete puzzle that overwhelmed me , seeing all this in pieces \ud83d\ude0a I succeeded 100% because of such detailed instructions . Sure it took me longer than someone who has a bit of experience. But my hubby said that it could be completed in roughly 1 hour with his experience of putting many items together but I wanted to give it a try all by myself . I needed a very small table for my limited space & small shallow drawers for reaching things easily without searching for an object in a too deep drawer in the dark . I also wanted an open space to put my iPad for easy charging and easy access without taking up drawer space and bending my wire in doing so . There is even space for a box of Kleenex beside my iPad . With the hole in the back to past all the wires , very practical. This table is the most beautiful with an extra , feature strip color lights with remote . So convenient to have usb ports & plug ins . What really was surprising for me was the wireless charging space . It works perfectly for my iPhone 13 Pro Max . Delivery was very fast . Also enough space to put a small lamp & alarm clock radio & my kindle e read & other small items . If you take your measurements perfectly then this table will match your needs. Sure the price might seem a little high but there are a lot of great features included to make life a little easier . Night tables among other furniture raised all their prices since pandemic & i looked up many places , either they were too expensive or didn\u2019t suit what I needed or out of stock.",
