                "reviewText": "I had seen a few reviews saying they weren\u2019t sturdy. Which made me hesitant but I\u2019m glad I still made the move and got them. I built the 2 nightstands within 2 hours..or within the Blues Brothers movie. Super simple instructions and they gave excess of every screw which was nice. They are very sturdy, don\u2019t wobble at all and way nicer than the 14 yr old ikea nightstands we had. The plugs have a usb and usb-c slot which is convenient. I\u2019m just really happy. The color is beautiful and it feels like it isn\u2019t cheap like it won\u2019t scratch very easy. And it all came packaged with styrofoam and styrofoam paper between every piece. We have a low profile platform bed so these low and wide nightstands were everything we were looking for. Honestly they seem as nice as furniture like an Ashley",

She reached out immediately after I posted my review and offered a great solution that worked for both of us. We were excited about these end tables as they looked awesome on the Amazon site. They were not easy to put together and I'm disappointed with the overall sturdiness. As I said in the headline - it's just okay. It looks nice, but every time I pull the drawer out I'm waiting for it to break. My wife and I put furniture together a lot and I'm pretty sure it wasn't user error. All in all a decent product but not sure I'd recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the soft brown wood tone/color on these nightstands. It matches the vibe of my bedroom so well! I\u2019m not usually a big fan of rattan material in general but I don\u2019t mind it on these too much because it lightens up the pieces a bit and ties in the other light oak furniture pieces in the room. I also love the built-in outlet feature - it\u2019s perfect for phone chargers so you don\u2019t have to move furniture to find the wall outlets. Assembly instructions were very straightforward and each nightstand took me about 20 minutes putting them together on my own. They seem very sturdy and decent quality, and I expect they\u2019ll last me for years. The price is awesome for a set of 2! Would definitely recommend.",

If you have a bed that's low to the floor it may be okay but if you have a taller bed or a bed with a box spring these will be way too short.",
