                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I ordered 2 nightstand for my bedroom and the colors I received are very different from each other! One was more yellow and the other was more grey (see pictures) I built the first one and loved the color; when I opened the second box I immediately realized it wasn\u2019t the same shade/color. This is a big no for me! I obviously need them to match since they\u2019ll both be in my room. Looking over the reviews again I now see others had the same issue w the color. I will try again & order another one. I really hope it\u2019ll be the same color as the one I built and loved. I\u2019ll be returning the \u201cgrey\u201d one; but this is definitely an inconvenience of my time. Removed 2 starts bc of color mismatch.The size was slightly smaller than I expected. I made sure the measurements would be the right fit for me before ordering but seems like it\u2019s a bit smaller than what is stated. At first I found it too small/ short in height but after a few days I visually got used to it.For the price it\u2019s a good purchase but the colors mismatching is a deal breaker for me!Assembly was fairly easy..instruction images could've been larger for more clarity or could include some text to clarify the steps. Took me a little less than 1hr to build.",
