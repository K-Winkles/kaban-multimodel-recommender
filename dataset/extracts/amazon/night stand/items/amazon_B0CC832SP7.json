It took way too much time and effort to try to make these holes line up, so I just finally gave up and left it as is.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mostly because it has a charging port, and I\u2019m pretty happy with that. It was easy to put together, the instructions nice and clear. The charging port seems to work well, and I\u2019ve had no issues with that at all. The drawers are made of fabric, which I didn\u2019t notice before I ordered it, but they\u2019re pretty sturdy and seem to hold up well to use. I got this for my bedroom, but I\u2019m considering moving it to the living room because it\u2019s a little taller than I\u2019d have liked for next to my bed. Overall, it\u2019s a pretty good price for a pretty sturdy piece of furniture.",
