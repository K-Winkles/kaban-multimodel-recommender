                "reviewText": "*UPDATE* I just put together the 2nd one I purchased & it's made me think that the 1st 1 was possibly an older version. The sliders for the drawers are different (nicer) than what's on the other night stand & the face of the drawers have a notched space for the handles to sit flush. So the drawers close all the way. My 1 complaint is that estheticly, they aren't exactly the same. The handles aren't the same shape & the color on the handles & legs aren't the same shade. Plus, the face of the drawers is slightly different. By comparison, what I received today is nicer. But I'm not going to worry about it because for the price & considering the amount of time it took to put together, returning 1 just isn't worth it. Besides, I doubt anyone else would even notice. So just be mindful of all this yourselves.*ORIGINAL REVIEW* The box it shipped in was unexpectedly heavy. I've ordered 2 of these, so I assumed they were both in the same box. Surprisingly, it was just the 1 nightstand. There are a bunch of pieces to put together but the instructions were easy to follow & I love that it came with metal Cam Locks. I've bought far more expensive furniture & recieved plastic ones that kept breaking. They even provide you with a little screw driver. Overall, it looks nice & it's sturdy. My only complaint is that the draws overlap a bit, so it doesn't close completely on it's own. But overall, for the price. I'm pleased with my purchase.",
