                "reviewText": "This is not a beautiful piece of furniture, but for the price I think we all understand that going in. So yes, it has that pre-made feel to it and it's made of veneer panels but it's solidly constructed and requires very little effort to assemble. The dark color looks nice and it's on the bigger side for an end table...makes a great nightstand in a kids room because of the nice added feature of the built in outlets. It has USB and regular outlet slots hidden under a black plastic insert on the top. Simply plug in the included AC power chord and these outlets are functional. I like that the power chord plugs into the table as well so if you don't want to use the outlets feature right away you don't have to have the chord plugged into the table. My son is currently too young to need the outlets feature but it will be nice to have in the future.",

It was easy to assemble, the parts came in tact, the shipping was fast, and the USB ports work!! However, the wood is cheap and there was a SLIGHT mark on the dresser. It was a little more pricey than the quality, however, the USB ports make up for it. Definitely recommend",

My only issues are that it came with a few dings & knicks on it, luckily not very visible. The blue power light is way too bright, but plugging in a usb cable in the middle port shields it some, and so does my jewelry box. Lastly, one of orders was missing a 2nd screw needed to secure the drawer handle. I had to improvise, but I made it work. It is still a good night table and the best one I\u2019ve had so far, style wise.",

I wouldn't have purchased this if I had known the condition, but repackaging and hauling back to have it returned seemed like more hassle than it's worth. The product pictures of this nightstand indicated a resemblance to a style of dressers from a now discontinued line of furniture from World Market, and that much at least gives it some value for me. I decided to try to correct the dings and blemishes and put the unit together. I assumed correctly that this is budget furniture. It feels flimsy after assembly and the symmetry is off where the top piece aligns with the supporting legs. The USB ports are a nice touch, but if you flip the switch to turn on the power, a bright blue LED light turns on. Not something I will be using in a dark bedroom at night. I'm leaning toward keeping the nightstand, though I would not recommend it to others.",

The threaded fasteners in the back panel (E) were not aligned with the screw holes the the table top (A). They were both off by 0.5\" so it just required widening the hole a bit and then everything was great. Since it was the same defect in both tables I would say there is a manufacturing issue but aside from that these are great looking bedside tables. The four USB ports on each table is more than enough to connect all the chargers you need!",
