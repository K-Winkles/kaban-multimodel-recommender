I use it as a small nightstand next to my bed in a small space and its perfect! The included assembly instructions do lack slight direction but construction is still fairly intuitive. My only recommendation when putting it together is to make sure you have the metal side metal brackets connected in a way that places the holes for the back supporting wood panel on the side of top shelf that is facing the back and not the front where the top shelf has an opening! Sleek looking shelf, Im glad I purchased it!",
