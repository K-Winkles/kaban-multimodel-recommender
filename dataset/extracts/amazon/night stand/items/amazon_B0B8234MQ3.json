Using it the first couple times it gave a faint burnt plastic smell and the power bar overheated, but as with any power bar, you should not overload it with several plugs as I did (one lamp and two devices that needed a full charge). Use this as you should any power bar and only use a couple appliances at once. There has been no burning plastic smell or overheating since.The adjustable feet are very useful for balancing the table on either an uneven surface or on two different surfaces. The shelf at the bottom is a nice space for any small things you need to store.Assembling it was a bit cumbersome. I am pretty handy at putting things together, but it was quite a process. It took a couple hours to put together. The instructions are very detailed and leave no question what it is you need to do. Some of the holes were drilled too small, so I had to find a way to either enlarge the hole or to skip that part altogether. I managed to place every screw and dowel with the exception of one screw on either side of the drawer because these holes were just too tight. The drawer is still remarkably sturdy for missing two screws.",
