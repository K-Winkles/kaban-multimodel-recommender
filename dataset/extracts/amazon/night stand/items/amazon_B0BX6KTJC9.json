It took me 15-20 minutes to do the job - read the instructions- it's pretty straight forward.The unit itself is exactly what the description said. We are using it for art supplies but you can't load the cloth compartments up and expect them to slide- they are cloth- use your common sense or buy non cloth furniture. I get tired of complaints on Amazon about items that are not being used as manufacturer explains or that don't serve the buyers purposes because they wanted the product to behave differently- those types of complaints distract from useful information gathering.This item has cloth drawers with semi rigid bottoms and they are solid enough to hold light plastic bins of art supplies or whatever lightweight items you want if you don't overload. The price was right for what it CAN DO. It was easy to put together and it serves our purposes.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been in the midst of rearranging and redecorating my space to make room for a large table I\u2019m building for my pet tortoise. It wasn\u2019t until I put together the table my enclosure will sit on that I realized just how much space I was needing and how much I was going to have to downsize. I wanted a wood bedside table with drawers. That\u2019s 1. Harder to find than expected and 2. EXPENSIVE!!! I wanted closer drawers and a lot of the wood pieces I was finding were shelves where baskets could be placed. After looking at similar pieces to this product, I ultimately chose this brand due to reviews and appearance. It has a small, but decent size wooden top piece that\u2019s big enough to hold a smaller lamp and several small items. The drawers are all the same size and have a nice depth to them. The boards that comprise the drawers are not flimsy as with other brands. The frame is strong and surprisingly sturdy even without items on top. I bought some non adhesive drawer liner from the dollar tree to line the drawers to protect them but also gives a nice look! You don\u2019t always have to pay high end dollars to make a space look nice. This piece gave my space an elegant/modern look while solving my space crisis I was having!!! And the price was reasonable. All and all would recommended to others! See attached pictures",
