It's the easiest thing I've ever assembled (took maybe 5 minutes), and good quality - it matches the rest of our baby's room furniture perfectly. It's also a great size - we have a small humidifier and light on top, and can also fit a bottle / binky. The bottom we use for a small basket of books. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a cute, aesthetically pleasing side table!",

I turned it upside down if I could and tried to put it towards the back if I couldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s definitely there. If it wasn\u2019t such an inconvenience to take apart and return to replace it, I probably would. I just don\u2019t have the time and will try to keep it out of eyes view as much as possible. I\u2019d give 5 stars for assembly ease, but probably 3 for quality and condition, hence the 4 stars. I know this isn\u2019t the most expensive piece, but I\u2019d still say I\u2019d have liked to see a better quality.",
