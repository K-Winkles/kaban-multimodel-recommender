The glass is pretty thick and doesn\u2019t seem breakable - as you can see in the video, I knocked on it pretty hard & it\u2019s very sturdy & makes a satisfying low-sounding thud. The magnetic closure is *very* secure - I could move the desk and the door wouldn\u2019t pop down. I like that though, and don\u2019t mind having to use two fingers to get it open because I\u2019d rather it be sturdy. The paint job is really nice and they even painted the tips of the screws to make it blend nicely. It was very easy to put together, it took me about 30 minutes all in all. Even when it does move, the legs don\u2019t wobble, as the entire structure is sound. I love this SO much and it\u2019s a massive upgrade from what I had before. Plus, the outlets work gloriously and I love having a space to plug in my wires. There\u2019s a little hole in the back to hide the wire for the outlet within the desk which is clever. Love it and definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This end table looks super cute. We bought two of them, and they fit in with our living room decor perfectly.Assembly was very straightforward. The first one took me about 45 minutes to put together myself, and the second one took me about 30 minutes. I only really had one issue where on of the foot levelers had incorrect threading. I couldn't really get it to screw into any of the legs. I tried the other three that were in the package, and they all screwed in just fine, so I know it was the threading on this specific part. My husband had to pretty much force it in using other tools.As far as sturdiness goes, you get what you pay for. These seem okay, but I wouldn't want to put anything super fragile on them. That said, they are just as sturdy as I was expecting them to be for the price.My only real issue with these is the overall design with the power cord. It's designed to come out of the top corner of the back rather than the bottom corner. This would have been a super easy design fix by cutting a channel into the back of the shelf for the cord to come through. My husband is planning to do this ourselves because it seems like a major design flaw to have the cord come out from the top as you can see if from the front most of the time.",
