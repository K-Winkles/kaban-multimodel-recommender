I really hate all the charging nightstands that just have the power brick sitting on topThis thing is over engineered, but sturdy and it took me about an hour to put together the first one, the second one was a lot easier closer to 30 minutes. There are a lot of pieces but the instructions are super clear.I was extremely pleasantly surprised for $35. These things are small but I knew that going in I really wish they had a larger size of these, it would be even better. Plus they look really good.",

                "reviewText": "It's wayyy smaller than I anticipated but I decided to keep it - only because it serves the purpose I needed it for. It was easy to put together and even though I had a drill, I really didn't need it. I appreciate that they included extra parts plus a small screwdriver and an Allen wrench (which wasn't needed). The instructions were pretty easy to follow. I love the easy to install charging station (SUPER convenient!). I can plug both my lamp and usb cords in and it works great plus everything is neatly hidden away. It's a pretty sturdy table, so I would recommend it except that it is tiny as heck - hence 4stars instead of five. It is 23\" tall as advertised but only 14\"x13\" on top. It was supposed to be 17\"wide.",

The really nice thing were the instructions. They really went the extra mile to show you the correct orientation of each piece to make sure you didn't screw up. It was really helpful and so easy to follow.",
