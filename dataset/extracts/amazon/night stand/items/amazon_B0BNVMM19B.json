Easy to assemble:- the DEPAD store sent a link to a video how to assemble even before nightstands arrived;- every package has a good screwdriver;- almost everywhere the same screw type used except for the side shelves screws and the top panel screws;- 13 parts to assemble only;- all holes drilled perfectly matching to others.2. Size is as announced, not sure why people expected a different size. Check the info first.3. The quality of wood is perfect.4. Rails for shelves are already installed.5. Great technical support - the DEPAD answers pretty quick to all questions via amazon.Cons:1. Some scratches and slightly damaged finishes/paintings might present on inner or outer sides of panels.2. Some edges have glue.3. No wheels (as announced), for some buyers it could become a problem because of the weight, but if you move nightstand without shelves installed, you will be fine. It is not heavy, but remember, it is made of wood.4. No place to keep light wires hidden.",

It ended up not being so, the instructions were simple and easy to follow, then there's a video which show's you how to put it together. The only thing I had wrong, at first, was the size. It was smaller than I had expected, but after putting it next to my bed it fit's well. The LED lights are a nice touch and make it stand out but, but what I like the most are the charging ports on top. Everything I need to charge is done right next to my bed. Very happy!",

Although for me this wasn\u2019t a big deal because I mostly just liked the design of the table and the fact it had the outlets on top, but definitely something to keep in mind if you\u2019re buying for the lights. Other than that they are both very sturdy and it only took about 45 minutes to put together one of them, although the images in the instructions were quite small. The drawers roll nicely and I\u2019m overall pretty happy with my purchase.",
