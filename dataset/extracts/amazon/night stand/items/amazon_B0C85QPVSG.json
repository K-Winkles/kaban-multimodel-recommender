                "reviewText": "I do like the overall look and functionality of these nightstands, but that is about where my pleasure ends. I've put together lots of furniture and cabinets, but I've never had one this bad. The instructions estimate 30 minutes for assembly... HA! Maybe for one... IF the parts are all correct.The first thing I noticed was that one of the pins that goes into one of the cams didn't have any place to use a Philip's screwdriver on it. (See the first photo - sorry for the dry fingers!) I thought that maybe they put in an extra one, which they did, but then I came across a second one. I had to screw it in with plyers.Then, when I went to put the top on, I realized that on both nightstands, the top of the left side had no holes drilled into it to receive the dowels and cam pins! (See the second picture.) That was a first for me. If you get these, make sure you have a drill and a measuring tape ready. Someone in the factory was asleep!There were also a couple of places where the edge of the laminated finish was chipped off. (See the third picture.) There were also several places where there were remnants of what I think was the laminate adhesive.Next, most of the holes for the cams were not deep enough, which means that the cams stick out above the surface of the panel. (See the fourth picture.)Be sure that you have all of your pieces. My kit only came with 7 of the 8 plastic screw-in wedges for the backs of the cabinet. (See the fifth picture.) Fortunately, they aren't an essential part of the structure.The manufacturer puts little stickers on each piece to let you know what is what. However, they don't always put them in a place that isn't going to be seen once the piece is completed, so you have to peel off the stickers... and the adhesive that is left behind when you do.Lastly, the backside of both doors had little holes all over them. (See the last photo. You may need to zoom in on it to see them.) I'm dealing with it since this isn't seen unless you open the door.Overall, if these didn't look as good as they do and have the price they have, I'd send them back.",
