I was initially worried it may be wobbly due to the legs but it actually came out quite sturdy. The legs are angled so that may be why they are not 100% sturdy enough for my liking. The plugs and charging base is what made me chose it since it's so convenient. Not a big fan of the cloth like drawers but it does the job. Not a bad nightstand for the price overall.",

                "reviewText": "This nightstand is really cute. I\u2019m in the process of re-organizing my master bedroom. I had a rolling cart for a nightstand, (new baby in the house), and it was convenient in the beginning. However, I have since had to add a few more things on top of my nightstand, such as a humidifier, and the rolling cart wasn\u2019t cutting it anymore. This nightstand was very easy to put together. Took me about 30 minutes, maybe a little bit less. Having the plugs right underneath the drawer is so convenient. One of the plugs I use for my phone charger was a little bit too short from the wall outlet, but having it plugged in right under the nightstand makes it the perfect length. The finish is nice and looks beautiful in my bedroom!",

Like a fraction of the size i thought it woild be.. on of the legs was split from top to bottom. And i definitely had no idea the drawer was cloth. I would not have bought this had i known. My kids destroy those cloth bins. Very disappointed in this product.",
