It is not a super super strong piece, but it is definitely perfect for what I need it for. It's almost like a laminate Woodish material. Again for the price and all things considered it's definitely very sturdy. Complaint was that it did come in a lot of pieces, and took me about an hour and a half to two hours to put together. Instructions were great and made it very simple. Just time-consuming. We recommend this to someone who's looking for something but doesn't want to spend a ton of money.",

The drilling and fit are precise and the hardware was perfectly marked, so no guesswork as to what should be used next and even the proper screwdriver was supplied. The instructions are easy to follow. The finished nightstand looks very nice, the ledge around the top prevents things from falling off, the outlet and USB ports are a nice feature. I personally won\u2019t use the LED lighting but it would be nice for someone else.One of the boxes had 2 missing parts, I contacted customer service by email, they responded without delay and promptly shipped an entire additional nightstand. Great product, excellent customer service and great value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "As soon as I opened the instructions packet I was so happy so see how perfectly all parts were labeled, and the pictures explained each step clearly. This is very important! But they weren't kidding when they said that it a 2 person job. You need someone to hold the parts together while you attach them. I had my tween help me so it took about 2 hours instead of the suggested 40 minutes. The LED light strips and built in charge ports are very cool. My only complaints are that the images shown in the ad suggest that it looks bigger than it actually is. It is very small for a night stand but could maybe work better as an end table? I should have looked at the measurements instead. Also, it is hard to believe that it will support 50lbs., but I don't intend to try it. The bottom of the drawers is thin like cardboard, but the sides are well supported and slide in and out well without falling out. It is a good buy, but maybe not worth the price.",
