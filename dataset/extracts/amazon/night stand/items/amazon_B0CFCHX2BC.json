                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2016",
                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent workmanship, easy assembly, good instructions, high quality.",
                "reviewText": "The quality of workmanship is excellent, and it assembles quite easily. Some folks have complained about the instructions, but I found them to be quite good and fully adequate. Based on other reviews, my first step was to start labeling the pieces with masking tape and a marker. But after about 2 pieces, I realized I was wasting my time. There was no doubt about the identity of each piece, if you look at the diagrams carefully. In fact, the one time I nearly did something wrong, I paused to study the instructions, and the details of the diagram showed the subtle differences in the hole patterns in the board, causing me to flip the piece and continue without further incident. So, just go slowly and carefully on your first one, look at the diagrams carefully until you're sure you have the correct parts laid out in the correct orientation, and you shouldn't have a bit of trouble.I bought two, and the second was short some of the nails used on the back cardboard. No big deal for me, but it might be aggravating for someone without 30 years of accumulated miscellaneous hardware. There were extra of those clever disk doohickeys in both of mine. All in all, I was perfectly satisfied with the contents. Note also that the packaging was excellent, and the parts did not have abraded surfaces from vibration in shipping. I found the tiniest chip in the edge of one of bottom front pieces, and simply colored it in with a dark brown sharpie, and the little white eye-catcher promptly disappeared. Note that you have a choice of bottom effects, if you don't like the gentle arc and prefer something a little more complex. (I like the simplicity of the arc.)I'm not a big fan of particle board furniture, but I needed a temporary solution and didn't want to spend a lot for something I might not keep for more than a couple of years. After assembling these, I find that I like them better than most of the $300+ nightstands I looked at in furniture stores. The drawer hardware is better than many of those units (some just had plastic slides). The overall value of these (looks and utility divided by cost) is incredibly high. Thus, I'm not only pleased that I gambled on these, but I'm also expecting to keep them indefinitely. When I do buy an entire new bedroom set, complete with matching nightstands, these will go into a spare room. I won't throw them away or sell them. They're just too nice.BTW, I was concerned about height, width, depth, drawer depth, etc., and these are just about ideal for my situation. I encourage you to take the published measurements and ensure they'll be appropriate for your bed height, wall space, etc. The only modification I made was to drill a 1\" hole in the back of each of the shelf sections (and color the edges with that sharpie marker) in order to feed electric cords through. That was easy to do post-assembly, but you have to be careful with the drill, of course, moving it very slowly into and out of position. Cut gradually, gently through, or you may make a ragged mess. (It's often best to cut partway through, then jump to the other side and finish. This keeps you from busting outward the last layer of material.)In summary, this nightstand is well designed, easy to assemble, and is high quality in every discernible way. It looks good, functions well, and is an outstanding value for the price. No regrets whatsoever in buying.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Feels sturdy and is a pure white color!",
                "reviewText": "We bought TWO of these tables for the sides of our bed. The color is pure white, very nice. The nightstand itself is study and feels like good quality. We drilled a hole to thread a charger cable for our cellphones. (Pictures provided!)*Pros -*\u2022 The color is pure white and beautiful!\u2022 The quality is pretty legit for the price!\u2022 Plenty of bedside storage and the top has plenty of room!\u2022 Drawers are pretty deep!\u2022 Assembly doesn\u2019t take too long! After assembling our first one, the second nightstand we blew right through in maybe 30-45 minutes!*Cons -*\u2022 The directions are a bit difficult to follow. Especially as far as attaching the wheel rails for the drawers. They are colored \u2014 but in the directions they are not.\u2022 I wish there was a small hole provided to run charger cords through the cubby space. We ended up drilling a small hole for this reason.* Assembly Warnings/Advice *\u2022 My main advice is to definitely pay attention to detail. One backwards thing can really set the whole project haywire.\u2022 Pay close attention to the Zinc Cam pieces. There are small ones AND large ones. THEY are NOT all the same size!! Do not misplace them. The small ones go for the drawers so just put those aside at the start and don\u2019t touch them until you assemble the drawers! If you misplace those in another spot on the nightstand, you will ruin the entire thing & be missing the correct pieces for the drawers!! The small ones can fit into the large sockets, but the large ones will not fit into the small sockets. So be very careful and just put those small ones aside so you don\u2019t accidentally put small pieces on another part of the dresser without realizing. You will not be able to assemble your drawers without those certain small pieces! (I hope that makes sense!)*Overall opinion*So far, we love these! Especially for the price! They fit our room perfectly, are a pure white color and provide much needed storage! You can also change out the knobs and we probably will later on as well to match our bedroom theme/bring a fancier aesthetic to them. The back board is actually pretty sturdy and it took some effort to drill through to make a hole for charging cord(s). I recommend these and am very happy with the purchase, especially at this price!",

                "reviewText": "First, I will say that this side table is beautiful, sturdy, and has a lot of storage space. I am very happy with the finished product. That being said...I have put together a lot of furniture, especially recently as I put together all of the furniture in my daughter's nursery. But this was the most complicated assembly I have dealt with simply because of the fact that none of the parts are organized or labeled. There are about 10 different pieces of hardware, and they all came in one bag.. what was especially difficult was the drawer slides. They are distinguishable with red and blue colored wheels, but there is no mention of that in the instructions so that distingushment was not helpful. 2 drawer slides parts that should look exactly the same had different ridges in them and we're not distinguished in the instructions. So even though I studied the instructions with care, I had to take the draw slides off in the end and rearrange them. Honestly, it could have been the last step so keep that in mind while you're assembling. It is helpful to have the drawers assembled so you can properly orient how they will need to be installed.Another problem for me was that after opening the box, I realized that all the components were filthy. As a note, I bought two of these so it was not just a fluke, they were both filthy to the point that my hands got black residue all over them. I had to individually wipe each piece as I took them out of the box. On top of that, there were multiple pieces with scuff marks, scratches, and nicks. However, I filled these with black permanent marker and it was not noticeable at all.So, all in all, great finished product. The drawers slide very nicely and the entire thing is very sturdy. Just be prepared for the obstacles you will face during assembly.",
