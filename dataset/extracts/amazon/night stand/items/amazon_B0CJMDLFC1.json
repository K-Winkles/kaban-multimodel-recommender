                "reviewText": "Very easy to put together. Love that it's mostly a metal base. If this was a wooden base with your material you use for shelving and the top I'd have been very disappointed.Thankfully that's not the case.Putting these two together combined took about 20 minutes which is pretty good! Would have been 15 but I put one on backwards woops.Very easy to follow instructions. Very sleek (Grey) color scheme. I just wish you could have set up a rolling system on the shelves instead of them being fabric like everyone else and used the same material for your shelving.Outside from that it's great and these are good BUDGET night stands. :)",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple issues with this nightstand. For one the drawers are cardboard with fabric and a wood facing with a handle on it. While the frame is metal the drawers are not meant to hold much, atleast nothing heavy. The outlets work which is a nice surprise. I would give this 5 stars IF it was around $30 but being listed around $50 it's just not worth it to me bc it's durablility isn't that great. If it was priced more reasonably I would recommend. But at $50 I do not recommend.",
