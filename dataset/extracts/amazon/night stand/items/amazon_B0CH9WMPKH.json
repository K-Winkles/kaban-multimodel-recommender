It wasn\u2019t too hard to build the slide out tray gave me a challenge but it was not too hard to figure out with some patience and time. Was built in about 2 hrs and it fits perfectly in my guest room. The lights are nice and bright with many options. The drawers glide nicely and I\u2019m very happy with it.",
