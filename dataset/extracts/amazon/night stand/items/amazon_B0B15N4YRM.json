                "reviewText": "I wanted to get my daughter a nightstand and a night light so to find a nightstand that IS the night light was perfect! I've read some reviews saying it's smaller than they were expecting but the measurements are listed in the description and they make taller versions of this nightstand if you are looking for a bigger version. The size of this nightstand is perfect for my child's bed. Just the right height and when assembled it looks great. Assembly was pretty simple. A little tedious because there are a lot of parts but the instructions make assembly pretty quick and easy. We have had this nightstand a couple months now and have had zero issues with the lights not working and sometimes it's on all day. My daughter loves the remote feature and she has a lot of fun changing the colors at night. I wish it was a little cheaper but it's a sturdy little nightstand and I am still very satisfied with this product \ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about purchasing this dresser because of all the horrible 1-star reviews about how hard it is to put together. However, I saw a few 5-star reviews with beautiful pictures and videos of the dresser, so I gave it a chance. If you have experience building other dressers and tables, this build is not that hard at all and only took me about an hour to completely put it together because of the many screws that has to be put into the dresser. The only complication I ran into was my RGB remote not working, but I figured out that it was because the battery in the remote somehow died, so I had to replace the battery for a low cost of $2. Other than that, this dresser is so cute! I definitely recommend it if you feel confident in your building skills and want a sleek RGB nightstand next to your bed!",

I purchased 2, one of the lights didn\u2019t work at all, and the other one stopped working later in less than a month. The front glossy drawers barely show gloss which was the main reason I bought these for. The drawer doesn\u2019t close well, and make so much noise. Not smooth at all.The installation takes too much time, so many pieces and so so many screws to put this little item together. It needs 2 to 3 persons for installation.Not worth wasting your money and time for it.",

                "reviewText": "The piece itself is decent and pretty solid, basically IKEA equivalent. BUT, I believe it\u2019s basically false advertisement, because although the description says a \u201cplug-in wired LED light\u201d, nowhere does it say it\u2019s actually only an LED wire that you plug in and stick to the drawer. In my opinion, the pictures actually try to steer you to think that the lighting is built into the piece and not a separate attachment. I\u2019m going to keep it because it\u2019s still an upgrade from the plastic drawer stack I was using in my office but it is likely not what you\u2019re thinking it is and in hindsight the price reflects that.",
