                "reviewText": "It's about 80% the size of my previous nightstand, so I had to make some adjustments to what I wanted to put in the drawer and underneath.However it holds my tablets and phone nicely with room for my prescription bottles on top. These were the most important features for me so I am generally happy.The drawer works smoothly, but the bottom is very thin. So don't put anything heavy in it.The led lights are nice, but have one major downside. There is no way to turn them off without unplugging them or throwing the switch for the entire power strip.The app works on my phone just fine. The music option makes for fun party lights, but they only go fast. So if you have slow music they don't match. But fast music is a lot of fun! You can adjust just about everything from the app, color, brightness, changing speed. You just can't turn the led lights off.It goes together fairly easily in a couple hours and seems solid once built. The drawer glides smoothly and easily. The wood laminate is a very nice color and has no damage. I give it 5 stars for quality of materials!If the nightstand had been a bit bigger, the drawer bottom a bit thicker, and there was a switch to turn off the lights on the app and nightstand I would rate it overall 5 stars.As it is, it is a very nice little nightstand and I look forward to using it!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a new nightstand that I could organize a bit better than what I previously used as a nightstand. And since I wanted a new one, the man got a new one too :)Assembly: Pretty straight forward as long as you follow along with the instructions. I did notice a few typos (for example, it will show that you need 5 of a type of screw, but in the zoomed in picture, it will say 4. Easiest way around this is to just count them in the zoomed out picture.) There was also an issue with holes properly lining up in subsequent steps if you tightened the bolts down all the way in a previous step. Luckily it was easy enough to loosen them back up, align things properly, install the hardware for the step you\u2019re on, and then retighten. There\u2019s also one locknut that you won\u2019t be able to reach with a screwdriver\u2014the larger of the included Allen wrenches will do the trick for that one though (that\u2019s not stated in the instructions\u2014the instructions show using a screwdriver which is impossible.) Took a little over an hour to assemble one.Seems quite sturdy and I\u2019ve loaded mine down with books (all titles I recommend if you happen to be able to read them in the picture.) The only real downside I\u2019ve noticed is that the drawer depth isn\u2019t deep enough to fit a standard size notebook into vertically, you have to place them in horizontally. To be fair though, if I would\u2019ve actually broke out a tape measure and checked things out beforehand, I would\u2019ve known this. It\u2019s a minor thing, but did surprise me that a standard notebook couldn\u2019t fit in that way. Perhaps the manufacturers will make the overall structure a bit deeper in the future. As for the rest of the size\u2014I did break out a tape measure before ordering, so overall, it met my expectations as far as the overall size. Not too big, not too small. The hooks are a handy feature and I may even get more to be able to hang additional items. Currently, one holds my sunglasses and the other holds a bag and a clipboard. The lights are a nice touch\u2026pretty basic, nothing fancy\u2026but frees up space by not needing to put a lamp on the nightstand.Overall, very pleased with the ease of assembly, sturdiness, and how much it holds. My kids want them now too, so I see purchasing these again in the future. Price point is fair for what they are and what they\u2019re made of.",

They had to manufacture me new parts and it took a while.BEWARE, this is not an Amazon supplier. If you don't like it, you'll need to pay for the shipping to send it back which will literally cost the same amount you paid for this",
