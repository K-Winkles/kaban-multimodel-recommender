                "reviewText": "Putting this end table together was a hassle. Everything is individually labeled, including the hardware separates into their own individually labeled bags. That portion of it was much appreciated. There was one hole that was drilled badly. The metal remnants were in the way of the screw going in and I had to somehow push the remnants aside to make space for the screw. Several other holes were also very difficult to screw the screws into.There are screw-on feet on the table legs so you can adjust the level with your floor. All in all, it took about 40 minutes to put together.The drawer is a really tight fit and I have to push really hard to get it to close all the way. I definitely can't open it with one hand. I have to hold the table down with one hand and yank with the other. Definitely a two-handed drawer, though it has loosened up a tiny bit with time. The railings for the drawer do work well. My husband and I joked that it's now the smoothest drawer in the house.We have turned it into a remote control and cord drawer to store them when not in use. The outlets and USB charging station work well with no issues, though the cords stick out from the top and look unseemly. It looks good in the living room overall and feels sturdy.",

I've been wanting to downsize anyway so it will be ok.What wasnt ok was how I struggled putting it together. Instructions were not helpful at all. I finally had to toss them away and put this together on my own. It took about 5 hours over 3 days (cause I got frustrated and had to walk away)... so way more than the 30 minutes they estimated. But, alas, it is together!Second night using it my cat tipped over my water cup and it poured into the plugs and usb ports.... not a good design at all. 1 port still works so not a total loss.",
