One of my favorite parts is the electric box isn\u2019t as obvious underneath the table as I have seen on some other. Overall these are great side tables for a great cost!",

I spent the extra money having him assemble it, and even with that the price is adequate.- Smaller than I expected (but that's probably my fault for not checking the measurements carefully.- Still cute though!",

                "reviewText": "These are absolutely a great bargain for two nightstands.First,Assembly: In reading some of the reviews before I purchased this, I almost didn't because of all the complaints about assembly. I'm a woman with a significant number of physical injuries from an accident, some have been surgically repaired, some still waiting, hence a great deal of pain is my life, so I was concerned. I put both pieces together on my own in about 2.5 hours while watching college football bowl games.Practical Use: I got these for my 94 year old mother. They're small, so she won't trip over them. The electrical and USB outlets on the top of the stands is perfect for an older person. No contortions to try to reach an outlet. There's an HIGH EDGE to keep things from rolling or falling off. I can't tell you how much I love this. My mom is notorious for just tossing things, and they go over the edge, then she tries to retrieve on her own, and all heck breaks loose. The stands are sturdy enough....The only con is that they aren't amazingly sturdy. Could I stand on them? Yes. Dance on them? No. I think for this price for two of them, they more than exceeded my expectations.I'm not sure what folks expect from these. The measurements are exactly as stated. They are small. Don't give a bad review because you didn't read the dimensions. Follow directions, and it's easy to assemble. They even give you a screw driver. They will survive a move - unless you throw them in the back of pickup truck, let it rain on them, and bounce on down the road.Absolutely buy these if you need something affordable.",

Granted they do photograph much larger than they actually are. So I\u2019m going to have to send back because after adding a head board, they are going to look even more ridiculous. If these tables were bigger they would of been perfect. The instructions were very straight to the point and was very easy putting one together. They are nice looking and I\u2019m extremely bummed after wasting so much time. Only giving three stars bc they might work for others just not against my cali king bed.",

But I am happy that I can put a word forward about how wonderful these tables are. Very easy to assemble , beautifully made, sturdy and what not. I put 2 on 2 different sides of my King sized bed. Gives such a rustic feel. And to my surprise these are a good size as well , not too small. Love my purchase.Also these are the lowest price you will find on Amazon .",
