They've made a habit of customizing their folders with stickers and drawings, making them uniquely their own. It's been a fun and creative way for them to take ownership of their school materials.Overall, the Five Star 2 Pocket Folder has made a positive impact on our household. It's a reliable, functional, and stylish addition to our home and school supplies. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an organized and enjoyable way to keep things in order for their kids.",
