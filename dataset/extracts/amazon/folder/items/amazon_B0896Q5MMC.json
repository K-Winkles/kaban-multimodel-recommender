Some of those products don't hold up as well because they're made from lighter weight stock so they bend and tear more easily.I was very happy to find the softer, more muted colors, they are very pleasing to the eye and still add that extra bit of color that makes identifying certain folders that much quicker.They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.",
