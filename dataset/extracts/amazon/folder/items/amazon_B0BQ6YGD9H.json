This has a narrower spine that is easier to hold and is very lightweight. It's perfect! Sometimes we have a lot of music (regular stuff, and holiday specific stuff). So, this is a great way for me to divide it up, but stay organized.I was worried about the size of the binder rings. They're not quite a 1\", but they are not bad at all and seem durable which is always a concern for me.The pen/pencil niche is a plus. I forgot about it until last night's rehearsal. Very handy for the many notes we need to make in our music.I will be purchasing more. Absolutely!Now I just need to figure out how to add a strap like my \"performance\" choir folder has . . .",

                "reviewText": "I love these. Super practical. The only thing to consider would be to make the rings larger so I can actually flip more than 50 sheets in it. It doesn't fit 150 sheets. At best it us more like a 70sheet binder but the rings are not very large so it won't let you move around the paper easily at the full capacity. If you put two pads of 100 sheets, they will fit, but you won't move them at all. That is the height of the rings, very small. I have rather thin sheets in pads for engineering so they are compact. I may take pics at some point.For now, I use these binders for materials for my classes and it starts getting crowded at around 20-30sheets. But, super practical to use, though. I will just be removing each exam section to a larger binder i suppose. No way you can fit there all stuff for science classes from 1 semester, but you can transfer them after each exam to another, larger, binder. Wish they had larger rings as well to kind of use them both, because the design of these is great! You will really enjoy this binder. Super nice quality and it probably will last for very long time. I got the ones with a pocket in front at 12 binders in a set. Will probably use these also for training purpose and give these away to students with experiment setups.A note to the company: consider larger rings that actually can fit those 150-200 sheets, not pages and use a binder with that amount in them. Lol. Try it and tell me it works.It is a nice binder, but it needs that one more option for those that plan to use it more actively and keep adding more notes or print-outs in it.",

                "reviewText": "Recently I have bought a few 1 and a half inch to 2 inch 3 ring binders due to needing them for my program work and office work, and in general book studies. Needless to say, this has been the best cure to all my grips with all the other 3 ring binders. Now I have bought even some of the most expensive ones with all the bells and whistles, but it still had all the same hang-ups. This binder is expanding as you add to it. Seems to hold quite a bit! The covers are light weight but very sturdy and water proof. The rings open and shut very nicely \ud83d\udc4c and it isn't a extremely tight fit to hold your full page top to bottom of paper (I have had some that there was no wiggle room). There is a place to hold your pen or mechanical pencil in the back. Plenty of room to add a folder or two into the binder as a devider with labels as I did and I'm absolutely just loving it. I do highly recommend this product and will be buying more of it.",
