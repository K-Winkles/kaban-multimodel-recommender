Maybe the listing needs to be updated. I deducted a star for getting a purple folder instead of the blue listed, and because these seem to be a different type of 2 pocket folder than the photo showed. Overall it will work for us and we will still use these because they\u2019re great quality.",

They still look new and that's with my 12 year old son shoving it full of stuff all last year and craming his backpack full since he chose not to have a locker. I'm not often impressed but for these to make it from the first day to the last day and still look new is shocking and wonderful!",
