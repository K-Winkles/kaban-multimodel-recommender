With the three prongs for three-hole punch paper in addition to the two pockets, this makes a great choice for school reports, too. Having built-in business card slots also makes it work as a sales presentation/business folder. It is versatile and the plastic provides a measure of protection from the elements...or spilled coffee.Overall, this is a nice set of folders. I will be ordering more.",

They do not fade over time.The exterior of the front cover has a plastic sleeve that can be filled with whatever you\u2019d like to personalize the folder.The interior of the folders has several nice features: there are 2 pockets to store papers in, there are prongs to fully attach papers, and there is an area along each pocket to store a smaller piece of paper, such as a small name card or business card.I love the durability of these folders. Anything that can last an entire year (or more) with 10 and 11 year olds has my vote!",

I'd estimate at least 50 sheets of paper per side of the folder.The folder comes with several features:-3 hole prongs-business card holder-compartment for a title page/labelThe 3 hole prongs work but cannot hold much paper. Maybe 15 sheets of paper at most. The prongs themselves seem like they may break off after a few uses.The business card holder sufficiently held my business cards in place.The area for a title/label was a bit challenging to get one piece of paper in at one pass. I needed to pull it out and straighten it out a few times before it was aligned right. I do not know what a solution would be other than to have a open/close mechanism, but that just seems like too much for the type of product this is.Overall, good product for keeping paperwork organized and in one place.",

They have a clear front pocket, so you can add a customized label sheet and then reuse it without having to remove sticky labels. These are always hard to find in different colors, at the beginning of each school year, so I always stock up when I can.",
