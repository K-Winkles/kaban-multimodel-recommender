Each has a small pocket on the front which holds a blank white card label (a bit larger than a business card) to indicate what is in the folder. The snap is secure and closes tightly. This folder easily holds an 8 1/2\" x 10\" notebook with plenty of room to spare. The folder measures about 13\" across by 9 1/4\". I received 2 of each color: purple, green, clear, pink, yellow, and blue. These are very handy for a project I am currently working on where I have numerous papers which need to be separated and contained for later reference. I only wish the folders had a gusset to make them more expandable along the sides. With that being said, they do have ample space and can hold much.",
