For a fairly low price, you get about 250 file folders (I didn't count so if it's really 247, I'm not going to fuss about it) in a box. Should last me for a reasonably long time. These are what's called \"1/3 cut\", meaning the paper tabs sticking up show up in 3 places, at one end, half way along that edge, and then closer to the other end. You CAN get '1/5\" cut if you want them placed at closer intervals. Pretty sure they make 1/4th cut but haven't bothered to verify it yet.",
