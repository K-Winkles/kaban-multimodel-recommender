The only thing is that when I applied the colored stocker tabs, I didn't like the look. And I carefully peeled them off. Now.. the advertisement says \"no residue\"!! BUT IT DID LEAVE RESIDUE. I scrubbed it hard with soap and most of it came off. The other thing is that I'm scared because the way that they put it together does not look that sturdy.. but it can still hold unless you are extremely rough.... overall I definitely recommend for 5.99 (not including taxes)",

From the insurance company, claims adjuster, mortgage company, claims for food and damaged goods, I am able to keep everything in one place, with separate pockets, at my fingertips. Purple is my favorite color so that adds a bit of calmness for me when having to deal with all of the paperwork. This is a great way for me to know everything is and it will be kept there and stay with the house. The pockets can expand and I can label each pocket.",

OK ... here's the thing ... When using file folders, keeping track of ALL the folders becomes an organizational issue as well ~ do I file them alphabetically? by subject? Am I loosing some papers that slide out the sides of file folders?, etc. This product keeps important papers organized and in one place. I use one folder for important insurance papers (Health, Auto, home, etc.), another folder for tax info papers, another for health records (medical, eyes, ears, prescriptions, etc.), another for travel (flight info, accommodations, passports, inoculations, etc.) and yet another for warantee info papers (phone, computers, appliances, etc.). The tabs are easy to identify categories, and as the folders are NOT paper, there is no tearing to deal with!",
