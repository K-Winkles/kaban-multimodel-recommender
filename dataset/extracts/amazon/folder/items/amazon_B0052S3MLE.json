There are 7 pockets which was my personal preference but I'm sure they have another one with more pockets. They also include little tabs where you can right the name of your classes to keep your folder organized. The zipper is also high quality and amazing because none of my papers would be able to fall out. The first pocket is on the outside and is a clear pocket to access and view important papers when needed. As a bonus in the front, there are two pencil holders to keep writing utensil on you at all times. The only negative thought I had about this product was the sticky residue left behind when I removed the big sticker in the front. This remained sticky and took me a bit of trouble to remove the stickiness because my mom had to use a special liquid to do so. Other than that this was such a great purchase and will be purchasing again for next school year.",
