                "reviewText": "If you just need a basic expandable folder with 12 divider pockets for storing papers, there's some definite overkill involved here - plastic divider sheets with (too small) tabs, two plastic sheet holders in each section to keep important papers separate, 12 cutouts on the front cover to enter more information, plus numeral 1-12 cutouts on the front cover that don't seem to serve any real purpose. And an elastic cord that holds the top and bottom corners together. This will do an OK job for home use, but I think most business people would rather have a functional but less flashy storage device. I would not take this to a business meeting.",

The 12 tabs and color coding makes it easy to organize my way. So many possible variations for organizing your way. The folder is well made and feels durable. As long as you don't overstuff the pockets this should last several years. Affordable when i went and looked at what these costs. I recommend this.",

Very nice and heavy duty material, plenty large pockets, and the colors on the tabs and front are wonderful; easily distinguishable if you are a color coder! This is going to be used for our 2024 receipts and documents that will be needed for next time we do taxes...and I am certain we will be using this for years to come This has quickly become one of my favorite office items!",

Once you add papers into the inside pockets, the outside expands much more than it first appears. The ends of the elastic which holds it closed has metal grips on the ends.

                "reviewText": "File organizer with 12 colors/pages, 24 pockets. Has elastic cords to keep it closed. Labels are on a piece of paper that can slide out. It can expand a little in the back, so it should be able to hold up to about 100 pieces of paper total in the 24 pockets (4-5 in each.) The only issue I have with the folder is the pockets are pretty shallow, if the pockets were about 3 inches deeper, things would be a bit more secure if you have smaller than page sized items in the pockets. Otherwise, I like the folder, seems well constructed and lightweight.",
