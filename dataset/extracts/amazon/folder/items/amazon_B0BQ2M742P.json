                "reviewText": "FoldersSo far I have nothing but good to say about the product. Well for starters I\u2019m in anal person. I like organization and I like things to look neat. Yes maybe I have a little OCD in me. Prior to seeing this product I had gone and purchased the thickest best paper folders that I could find. I spent two days redoing my entire file cabinet. I had to use my DYMO label maker for every file. Somewhat of a big project! About two or three months after I finished the job I ran across these folders. I wish I ran across these before I spent all that time and money redoing my file cabinet. So I decided I had to have (try)these therefore I spent another two days re-doing my paper ones which were already showing some wear within two or three months. I keep all my monthly bills, accounts and doctors organized. Like I said I\u2019m an anal person So I took my DYMO LabelMaker which is available through Amazon. I went through about 70 + folders and redid them. As I labeled them I tapped every folder label with clear packing tape. I think they\u2019ll last for a while. So far I\u2019m thrilled with them. I do have a question to the seller if it would be possible to pick out your custom folders. I know you have a large variety of colors and I\u2019m not complaining and I hope I don\u2019t offend anybody I just don\u2019t care for green and I would\u2019ve loved to swap them out for red or orange. Also for people like me I know they come with a white paper label for every folder but I know that the labels will show wear so I thought would be cool if you sold some kind of clear tape especially for the people that don\u2019t have a DYMO label maker that has plastic tape not the typical paper. I would have purchased something like that. This is not a complaint? I would have Loved to have that option. Even if I had to pay a little more I mean I know they all cost the same price to you so I just wanted to ask. The first time I bought a 12 pack because I didn\u2019t know about the 30 pack. So far I\u2019ve bought 72 of these folders and so far I\u2019m happier with the plastic than the paper ones. That\u2019s a no brainer. I have been recommending these not only to my friends but to my doctor offices. I even made a comment to my local Hospital after I noticed their paper files. Maybe I ought to start asking for Commission because I\u2019ve sold Quiet a few (that\u2019s ha ha)!!! Again thank you very much!!!",
