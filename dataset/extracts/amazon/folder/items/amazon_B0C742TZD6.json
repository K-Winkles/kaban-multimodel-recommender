                "reviewText": "This accordion folder is a good deal for $5 but if you need something with serious storage capacity and durability then you should buy something more premium. There are 4 dividers which translates into 5 pockets. The snap clasp only extends for a couple of inches and the bottom doesn't expand at all so this is best for students who want to keep their papers or notebooks organized since it is very portable. For storing and organizing important papers at home this is probably not the right choice unless you aren't planning to store very much.Another potential issue is that there isn't a good way to label the dividers. You get 5 stickers that smear easily and don't stay securely on the divider tabs. After two weeks of carrying this around in a backpack and using it to organize work papers, none of the stickers were still on the tabs or in any way still usable.Ultimately since this accordion folder only costs $5 you need to have realistic expectations about what it is that you're buying. This is pretty well-made in terms of overall durability and seems to be specifically designed for students. If you're a student or parent with a child who wants a portable file that will protect their school papers and keep them organized this is definitely worth five bucks.",

I am able to keep the 1966 vehicle in one and the 1955 vehicle in another. It's great to have the separate sections so I can keep maintenance in its own, registration in its own, vehicle history/memorabilia together, etc.To me this is so much easier than having a file in a cabinet. I keep these in the bookcase and if I need everything on one car or the other, there it is! It's so handy to have everything in one place and to be able to transport everything together, if I need to do that.I have had this for a while and it has held up wonderfully!!!!",
