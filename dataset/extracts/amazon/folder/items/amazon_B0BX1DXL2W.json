It just looks so cute and bright in my travel bag and is easy to find quickly since it stands out. I used it on a trip to keep my documents and such organized and safe/flat and I am currently using it to store various mementos and photos in my craft cabinet. It holds a good amount while still maintaining its shape and it is easy to get things in and out. I love that you can see into the front so that you can grab things without having to sort through and find where they are. The magnetic closure is also nice, secure enough and much better than the folders with those winding string closures. I think this is a great value overall and I am very pleased with it so far!",

I like that the magnetic closure is strong enough that the folder won't open accidentally, and I also like that the pockets are clear. It does smell a little plasticky, but that will fade with time. My biggest gripe is that the smaller pockets are attached to the back part of the folder as opposed to the front, which is good because the material on the back is sturdier and less prone to the pockets tearing away from it, but bad because it's harder to locate the items in the smaller pockets. Despite the pocket situation, I still really like this and will definitely get use out of it. \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice folder for carrying papers between work and home. It seems to be a nice, thick, quality plastic and will hopefully hold up for a while. I appreciate the magnetic closure to keep things in place while in my bag versus a manilla folder or regular folder where things can spill out or get bent. It's not super thick as far as capacity, so it wouldn't hold a huge amount, but it works for my need. I also like that it has a couple additional pockets inside to help keep smaller pieces of paper/sticky notes. The cute color is a nice bonus. Overall, a nice product and I would order from this company again.",
