They haven\u2019t fallen apart yet so that\u2019s a plus because I hate cheap folders that fall apart after a month into the school year. I would recommend these they are good for the price and the colors are pretty also.",

This is exactly what I was looking for, to carry a 1 or 2 pages document that needs some form of protection during hand carry. The colors are vibrant and nice combination that makes it easy to distinguish at a glance. Recommended",

                "reviewText": "I was actually just looking for basic paper folders when I came across this set and am surprised by how much I love it! The colors are even prettier in person; they're slightly more muted/pale than I expected and compliment each other really well. The peachy color almost makes me think of a creamsicle, and I almost feel like these could be described as ice cream, candy, or dessert shades vs. \"retro.\" I know the colors aren't necessarily the top priority when buying folders to hold documents, but having cute office supplies just makes me happy and can make organizing more tolerable. The outside of the folders feel smooth, not scratchy to the touch. They are definitely thinner and easier to bend than I expected, but I wouldn't describe them as flimsy and I don't think the greater flexibility means they will be less durable with normal use. I was able to put a very thick stack of papers into each pocket of one folder and still close it easily without the papers sticking out the top or bending. The folders are semitransparent so you can see the top paper through the front but I like that because it helps to keep track of what's inside. Overall I'm super happy with them and plan to order this brand again!",

It's almost impossible to slide an 8.5x11 sheet of paper in. The sleeve is not wide enough. I had to cut the paper to 8-1/4 and it slides in easy. Just know this.",
