For example, earlier I just stuck a bunch of auto service and insurance records in a binder because hole punching all those individual pieces of paper was a daunting, time intensive task. With these organizers, their deep pockets and 3 ring binder holes, I could fit everything in neatly to sit on shelf in less than 10 minutes. And to find and take out what I want, I don't have to undo the rings and fight to get other pages to stay put or get back on the rings. I can look through pockets easily. These plastic organizers are not only colorful, but so much thicker and tougher than paper ones I've tried in the past whose binder holes inevitably rip. I will be getting more of these for household records and warranties.",

                "reviewText": "This set of folders worked exactly as intended. They keep my notes organized very well. These are very sturdy and can keep many notes inside. They can fit inside binders with ease. Overall, they are solid for anyone and at the price point of $12.99 for these 6 packs and with the 5% coupon they are even more worth it, I absolutely recommend this to all.",

                "reviewText": "My son needed these for school due to the ones the school gave him at the beginning of the school year ripped in his binder. These are way thicker than his previous plastic ones he had. He says he likes them way better and know they will last a lot longer. Colors are vibrant and keep his work organized. Love the smaller slots to keep his smaller notes organized as well. These are worth the money that's for sure.",
