It\u2019s the right size, holds all of the documents well, is easy to use, and has a relatively small footprint. There are labels included that allow you to create categories for each individual section. At first the folder would collapse when I didn\u2019t have enough documents inserted, but I discovered I could manually expand it and it held its form. Another positive is that it doesn\u2019t smell. I\u2019m sensitive to chemical odors, so that\u2019s a deal breaker for me.",
