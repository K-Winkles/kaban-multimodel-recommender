                "reviewText": "These two-pocket folders come in 5 vibrant colors. They are nicely textured, have \u201cpockets\u201d inside on both sides, and each pocket has 4 small slits in it to accommodate a business, or other similarly sized, card. The pockets are actually more of a trough since the folded flap forming them is not glued at the inside spine so thus the \u201cpocket\u201d goes all the way across. These RAZCC folders feel lighter than ones I am used to, so in an attempt to be as objective as possible, I made some quantitative measurements of the folders under review and of some new-old-stock folders of the same style that are at least a decade older. The RAZCC folders are 8% lighter by weight and the material is 8% thinner in thickness.The vendor suggests that each folder \u201cHolds 50+ sheets per pocket, ideal for long-term use and storage\u201d. I tried placing 50 sheets of 20 lb. copy paper in each pocket. While it was possible, the result was not desirable (see photo). The pockets were over-extended and the folder would not lay flat. If you do intend on using these for long-term use, I recommend that you not put 50+ sheets per pocket.Irrespective of these issues, I am pleased with these folders for my intended purposes. I intend them for daily uses such as: filing like papers together; holding airline, rental car, and accommodation information while on travel (they fit nicely in the carry-on bag\u2019s front pocket), corralling related project papers into one place, organizing bills, etc. I can, and do, recommend them, and, provided they are not overfilled, I expect them to have an acceptably long service life.",

I use them for manuals that come with appliances, electronics tools, etc. I just have to go to the file and pull the books for parts, prices, troubleshooting. I give some to the grandkids for school too. Looking at the price it\u2019s very efficient to buy this many and use for the kids in school. The colors are vibrant and the folders are durable. 2 thumbs up",

My photo shows some empty space in the box because my family did not hesitate at all to start grabbing folders and using them! LOL! These are typical 2 pocket folders. They have a textured feel on the outside. And inside has slits in each pocket, in case you want to put something like a business card there. These would be great for home, office, or school. Good quality. Vivid colors. Nice textures feeling on outside. Hold up very well. Very happy with this folders!",

Businesses use them for promotional materials and it's like they know you're going to throw it around in your car for 3 weeks before you remember to carry it in the house and bury it under a pile of junk mail for the next 5 months. Then, you'll need to know something about whatever you were buying that they were selling and you'll run around looking for it. Eventually you'll find it and all the material looks just like new because these are some tough folders. Colorful enough to get your attention and for you to remember. You can hear it now, \"Honey, where's the green folder that car salesman gave us with information about the new Teslas?\" Ha! You know what I mean. These are great for their intended purpose with the business card cutouts to hold those cards in place for months or years. You cannot beat the price and you get so much more than what you pay for.",

They arrived quickly and the kids really like the bright colors.",
