                "reviewText": "2024-01-30. Plastic 2-pocket folders by SKYDUE. Clear front. 6pcs. Assorted pastel colors.These folders have a clear cover which allows you to slip in a sheet on the front to clearly define what is inside, and these folders comes with a matching colored index sheet you can use and slip right into the front cover. These folders do not have a three ring punch in them. The folder measures 24.5cm (9.65\") x 31.5cm (12.4\"), large enough to hold size A4 (8.3\" x 11.7\" European size) as well as your standard Letter (8.5\" x 11\" North American) sized sheets. Lastly, the inner pocket design has a flap on the top side, so you can tuck the papers under it to avoid falling out. They also have a slot for business cards making them ideal for business proposals.Overall, these are exactly what I was looking for. This 6-pack, 2-pocket style folder retails for $6.98 (at the time of this posting) which is a good buy in my opinion. The only notable I have is that these plastic folders seem very durable and flex very well; however, they are not fold-proof. If you fold these at a spot other than the center, they will crease permanently. Other than that, they're exactly as pictured.",

The front is a clear view cover (comes with a slide in paper if you want to use it). You can print a nice cover design with company name, logo, etc. and slide it in the front cover. The inside is has reinforced pockets, with cool page holder tabs on the outer top edge to keep loose papers from falling out. LOVE THAT. There's a biz card sized 4 corner slit/cut out on the left side pocket too. See the pictures. There are no 3 hole clasps, this is just a folder for brochures, loose pages, and the like. SUPER for what I need (New Membership folders for a non-profit). Also love the colors, which are soft, muted - and unlike regular old plastic folders. These are quite nice, and will make a good impression when handed out.",

                "reviewText": "I usually use two pocket Pendaflex folders that are made of paper/cardboard to organize paperwork for trips. They do the job well, but when I travel I like having a transparent front on my folder so I can put a one page summary for the trip including things like flight times, confirmation numbers, addresses, etc. so I can access them without opening the folder and paging through the individual sheets to find basic information. I ordered these because they have an outside pocket that I can slip my one page summary into, and the two inside pockets have an extra top flap to hold the papers.Comments / observations - The folders are lightweight, easy to open, and well made - The outside front pocket is very transparent and allows my summary sheets to show through. In the example above I just used one word (Mexico) to demonstrate this. - The six pack of folders come in different colors for those who want to color code - The folder is the standard size, same as my usual folder - Each folder comes with a color-matching summary page with sections for Information, Notes, and Contents. Could be useful for some, though I do not use them for my trips - I deducted one star because the width of the outside front pocket is a really tight fit to get a standard 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper into it. Really had to carefully push my Mexico title page to fit into the pocket (on the plus side, once it is in you don't have to worry about it falling out!). The summary page that comes inserted into the front is 7 7/8\" x 10.5\" and that slides in and out easily. Worst case scenario I could trim about a quarter inch off the width to fit in the outside page.Overall a good folder and I don't regret getting them.Hope this review helps!",

I like that these folders feature: 1) clear front folder slot, 2) business card slot on the inside, and 3) upper corner tabs on the inside to keep papers in place. I personally like pastel colors. These folders are somewhat thin, but are plastic so more durable than paper folders.",

                "reviewText": "We volunteer at our church assisting couples preparing for marriage and use cardstock folders to keep together and organize the various documents required for each couple. The current folders do not hold up the best over time and we have been looking for more durable versions to replace them.These SKYDUE Plastic Folders fit our need very nicely. They are durable and seem to hold up well even after multiple handlings. There are inner pockets on both sides of the folder and the inside top has a pocket to hold the top of the documents securely. We really like the multiple colors as this helps us to quickly differentiate the folders assigned to each couple. The front has a sleeve that we further use to identify which couple's information is inside. These are a great step up from our old cardstock folders!",

This is handy for documents, receipts, and things you intend to store for longer. It goes in the front transparent pocket, so you can replace it if you want.The inside has nice details like the cut-edge pockets that make it easier to put papers in.The little flap at the top helps to keep the files secure in place.The business card slot can help store single-subject documents, and it does not get in the way in case you don't use it.",
