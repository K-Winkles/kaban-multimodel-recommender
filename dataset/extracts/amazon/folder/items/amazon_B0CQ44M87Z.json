                "reviewText": "I have a number of paper files and it seems they either fit A4 or letter comfortably. This fits both perfectly, per the description. The file itself is sturdy plastic. The bottom of it measures 3/4in, but the top clasp (plastic snap) allows about an inch width. The tabs are plastic and wouldn't be easy to write on so there are colored labels included. Because this fits A4 paper, it's a little longer than typical American paper files so be sure to check measurements if you plan on carrying this in a bag. If you need something for A4 and/or letter size, and the extra length for A4 isn't a problem, this file is perfect. I would definitely buy more!",

It\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever even have as many as 100 papers in this and won\u2019t be using it everyday so it should last a long time. The dividers don\u2019t seem super sturdy but ok for these kinds of folders. It comes with label stickers in 8 colors with 2 of each. Easy to use, keeps papers secure, and looking better than a stack of folders, seems to be a fair price for the size and looks.",

I didn't get the color that I ordered and ended up with the marble pattern. The print dpi looks quite low so it's not very clear. Would not recommend the marble design.",

It does have a little \u201ckeep your chin up\u201d inscription that I don\u2019t really know why they added because I think it would be cuter without it, but\u2026 Keep your chin up.

                "reviewText": "I appreciate that this accordion file is very lightweight and has several dividers in it to keep separate documents organized. The color is very pretty and it even came with sticky tags to place on the divider tabs. The only thing I have to say regarding a concern is that the file looks as if it is heat pressed in order to keep the file together as a file holder. There is one area where you can feel the groves of where it was heat stamped and other areas that are smooth. So it looks a little uneven on one side than the other. But it does the job and holds and separates my documents like I need it to.",
