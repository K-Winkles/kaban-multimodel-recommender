                "reviewText": "I am first to admit I get tired of the drab colors of office supplies so I love to change things up, and these folders do that nicely! I was initially impressed with the packaging and a handwritten \"thank you\" for my order, but then I was pleasantly surprised that they are heavy stock like any high-quality brand of folder. I know I will enjoy these for years. That said, I'm taking a star away because while sturdy, the tab and top of the folder is not reinforced as some are; I think it adds durability and life to a folder. Also, they have white interiors and white tabs, and I wish it was colored throughout--if you're looking through files and you know you're looking for a green folder, the white tab doesn't help. It may just be a matter of preference. But even at that, I would definitely buy these again because of the exterior color and quality.",

I actually had to look up the material because they are so thick and glossy, I thought they were plastic, but the listing says that they are made from paper. They are very durable and much nicer than standard manila folders. These are 1/3 cut folders. There are six different colors, three of each color, for 18 folders total. Each color has a different tab style, so for example, all the pink folders are center tabs, all the blue folders are left tabs, etc. The other thing I love is that the colors and tabs are in rainbow order. So you can line up all the color in order and the tabs are also lined up. I like me colors to be in rainbow order. I'm obsessive about it. I actually took my boss' excel sheet once and re-ordered the highlights so they would be in the correct order.",

I am a 74-year-old artist, and the little kid in me loves the colors. To me, that is the big selling point. When I open my filing cabinet and see the colors, it gives me a bit of extra joy on an otherwise manila day. If one is a buttoned-down manila person, stick with manila folders. Otherwise, add a little fun to your life and get these! The manufacturer's photos and description are accurate, so there is no need to repeat them here.",

                "reviewText": "These 18 colorful quality file folders are perfect for my office and personal needs. Three features stand out. 1 - They are thicker and more durable than the average folders I have bought and used for years. Because of their durability they won't easily wear out. 2 - Each folder can be kept and used several times for additional purposes. They are made to last. 3 - There are six tasteful colors in each pack. (The inside of each folder including the tab on the upper right is clear white.) You can use a different color for different file categories. I am using them for my volunteer work as well as for my part time business.",

                "reviewText": "I can always use new file folders and these are neat! These letter sized folders came in a pack of eighteen, There were six colors: pastel yellow, pink, blue, lavender, orange and green, and three files of each color. The color coding makes sorting and organizing files easier. Just a quick look and I locate the file that I want. The folders themselves appear to be made of a laminated, heavyweight paper. They're sturdy yet very flexible. The 1/3 cut tabs are large enough for file labels. I don't anticipate any problem with these folders ripping, tearing or getting \"dog eared tabs\". I consider these a very good product at a good price.",
