I staple receipts for items to the cover and insert alphabetically into organizer. I know I can get information online, but sometimes this is quicker. Good price, sturdy and just the right size.",

                "reviewText": "I get a new folder every year. We are 8 months in and the tabs are no longer visible. The tabs need to be at least 1/2 inch higher to be visible. 3/4 inch deeper pocket would be better because you need to push against the edge of the paper sticking out to find the tab and the paper edges are getting bent on some documents. The other knock is it would never stand up. You would need two hands to use it. I solved the problem by keeping it in a desk drawer and screwing the from to the side of the drawer to the folders stays upright and useable. I side from that it is staying in one piece and there are plenty of pockets. It will easilly expand to a foot, so document capacity is great.",
