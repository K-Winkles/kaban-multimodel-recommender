                "reviewText": "I can remember my Dad using these when I was a kid a long time ago. Like most folks these days I have pretty much computerized just about everything. Now computers are suppose to cut pack on the paperwork we produce yet I seem to be having the opposite affect. Every day I receive E-mails, computer generated faxes, billing and payment receipts. Some of this is important and some is not even worth printing and saving. The material that I find important enough to print and save goes into these Pendaflex folders. The two I ordered are replacements for ten or more year old folders that finically wore out after a lot of use and abuse. I find them extremely useful for other things besides daily paperwork. I have one for appliance instruction books and warranties. I have another for clippings and research. I have one just for everything needed for my eventual death including will, complete info on accounts, account numbers, vechicle forms, prepaid funeral arrangements, living will, medical information and Power of Attornies. My wife use to keep recipes she cut from magazine and news papers. My daughter kept all her school art work from grade school right throug college. My granddaughter now has her own folder for her important stuff. I guess I could go on and on but I believe you get the idea.Plenty of partitions, plenty strong and priced very well. Some of the ones I have are nearly 35 years of age and older. They hold up great. There are two minor reasons why I gave these 4 stars. Comparing these new folders to my older folders I believe they have shrunk a bit. They are also a bit heavy. Other than that if needed I'll reorder again.This review was written without any financial considerations. Full Amazo retail was paid.",

Nifty cover and super bungie.I do wish they made one 3/4\" wider so I could use my manila folders (which come 11 5/8\" wide) - I scissored them down to exactly 11\".Also, the huge tabs in this product covered up 2/3 of my manila folder tabs - I trimmed the tabs with scissors: not a fun job, even for an OC guy like me. (Your probably don't want to trim them completely off: they are handy for finger-walking through the dividers.)Product Wish: a fully expandable file holder, durable synthetic material, handles (and cinch straps), wide enough (and tall enough) for manila folders with adjustable placement clear plastic inserts for the dividers (like in hanging folders), with an \"accordion\" design that doesn't interfere with the contents, stands comfortably upright when expanded, compacts neatly (without warping) when compressed and cinched.",

Su mayor ventaja en mi opini\u00f3n es que tiene 21 separadores cuando la mayor\u00eda de estos organizadores cuenta con 13 o 12. El cart\u00f3n se ve resistente sin embargo tampoco es muy grueso y no podr\u00eda decir que pueda durar varios a\u00f1os. Lo compr\u00e9 a un precio excelente por 77 pesos, que me parece muy justo sin embargo no pagar\u00eda m\u00e1s de 100 por el producto",
