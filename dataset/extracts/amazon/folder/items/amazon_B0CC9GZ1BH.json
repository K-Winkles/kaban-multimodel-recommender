(What isn't, these days?)Final thoughts:We ordered this because we homeschool our son and thought \"Hey, a great way to store his work, his to-do stuff, and his art.\" Just wasn't expecting so many, when my wife said \"Well, you got a lot of folders.\" ...I didn't think there were 75 of them. I'm not sure what we'll do with all of them when it's all said and done, but they'd be great for schools or workplaces where many people's needs could be met with these. Honestly, they're better than the folders I had when I was in school. Gosh, those things tore if you looked at 'em funny. Not these.Just be sure you want to have this many folders on hand, and if so, I can absolutely recommend these. If you need just a few, maybe elsewhere.",

                "reviewText": "I use these two pocket folders, instead of typical file folders for individual projects that require less than thirty pieces of paper. These pocket folders protect the pages from sliding out like regular file folders. They eliminate the frustration of reorganizing the pages, flattening wrinkles, erasing smears, or replacing damaged pages that tend to escape from file folders without pockets. At $0.40 per folder, these are more expensive than lower-level standard, manila, one-third cut file folders currently available for as low as $0.16 per folder. However, file folders of different colors or made from thicker card stock are comparable at $0.42 per folder.I group similar projects by putting them in folders of the same color. For example, my blue folders group consists of information on pieces of equipment. In one blue folder, labeled \u201cPOLARIS ATV,\u201d I have the receipts for the purchase of my ATV along with the user\u2019s manual, information on my rider\u2019s training course, copies of the webpage that describes the vehicle, insurance information, and the recall letter I received about a wiring problem. In a yellow folder (yellow is for folders of property-related information) I have several pages of information on my property taxes. Another yellow folder holds the information on two sheds I have added to the property. I put a label on each folder describing its contents.These folders are perfect for organizing commonly kept documents. They are made from a thicker card stock than standard file folders. Each pocket is unattached on the side closest to the fold so it is easier to put papers in and take them out than folders that have pockets attached on three sides. The color coding helps me find information quickly.",

                "reviewText": "At the normal price point ($30) for this 75-pack of 2-pocket folders, each folder is 40 cents. Not a bad price at all. Just be aware that these are \"volume\" quality folders. As such, they are made of thin paper stock and very much on the flimsy side. As noted in the photos, unlike some competitors, these folder are not glued or stapled at the center crease in order to produce two separate pockets -- one for each side. Because of this, any sheets on one side of the folder and easily side to the other side.If you are looking for business-quality folders for presentation purposes...keep looking. These bulk folders are most suitable for classroom use, single-use situations, or for file storage. They are colorful.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, these folders are so much better than plain Manila folders because papers cannot slip out at the bottom.The material is thick enough to withstand some wear and tear when transported and moved in and out of backpacks, satchels, etc.The pockets hold a lot of paper - both sides can hold the thickness of a legal pad and you can still close the folder. The capacity is mostly due to the fact that the pockets are not attached to the middle fold which also makes them less likely to rip when overstuffed.I particularly like that the folders have two pockets - that is great if you want to separate papers into 'done' and 'to do' or 'important' and 'can wait' or other categories.The colors are a nice feature, especially if color coding folders for different purposes is important.The left pocket has small slits to fit a business card or a small note or flashcard.The material allows for labels or stickers to adhere easily.Slightly more expensive than Manila folders but still at a very good price a piece (judging from the 75ct pack).",
