                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Practical Organizational Solution",
                "reviewText": "The Amazon Basics Heavy Duty Plastic Folders I bought not too long ago have been an invaluable tool for keeping my house and office in order. Here are the reasons why I gave them four stars:In a word, yes, these folders are \"heavy duty.\" They're constructed from a robust plastic that seems like it could hold up to daily use. The edges and corners have been given further reinforcement to make them even more sturdy. However, if they were a tad thicker to assure long-lasting use, especially for people who intend to put them through harsh daily wear and tear, I would have awarded them a perfect score in this category.Each folder has ample space for letter-size documents. Even though the folder's two interior pockets come in handy for sorting papers into manageable piles, they may be too shallow to hold larger documents without making the folder look squished. While more storage space in the pockets would be nice, they serve most purposes.Random Colors (4.5/5):I like that there is a rainbow of hues represented in this set of twelve files. It's a beautiful method to visually distinguish between and keep track of various types of paperwork or projects. The bright hues breathe life into an often dull office supply.These folders' adaptability makes them useful in many situations. They function well in the classroom, on the job, and in the home. When I try to fill them to their utmost capacity, however, I find that they become rigid and difficult to close. If they could be more lenient in this regard, it would be fantastic.For a fair price, you can purchase a set of 12 folders, which is excellent value. They do what you need them to, and you get a respectable amount of folders for the price. Keep in mind that if you're hard with your organizational tools, they may need to be replaced sooner despite the outstanding longevity.When it comes to maintaining order in your paper files, look no further than the Amazon Basics Heavy Duty Plastic Folders. They last a long time, come in a variety of colors, and are reasonably priced. While they could be better in several respects (such as pocket capacity and flexibility when stuffed to the gills), they are still a good option for general-purpose organizing. These folders are a good choice if you need an inexpensive yet effective solution.",

Sometimes, I get confused about which side is the front. However this is just me being nitpicking.",
