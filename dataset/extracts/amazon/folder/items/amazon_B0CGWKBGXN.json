The fact that they offer your folders in two colors, pastel, and full-strength color on each folder is just wonderful.I have never seen this presentation before, so I am saying this: Do not be fooled by the plain cover of the package they arrive in. Get ready. Wait until you open the box and see how strong, sturdy, colorful, and beautiful the selection you have chosen is. They even give you the choice to hole punch your folders if you wish, or leave them up punched as they are. Neatly boxed, colorful and lovely, strong, and durable, and your choice to hole punch or not, all summed up makes this a special folder selection, I do not believe you can find elsewhere.I love this assortment, and I feel quite sure. You will also feel the same way. I do hope this review has been helpful to you in making your best choice.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great pack of sturdy 1/3 cut letter size file folders. I was almost out of file folders to use in our home cabinet, so when I saw these offered, I thought I would try them. They give you a variety of colors so you can separate and label based on subject matter, if desired. The colors look nice - they aren't super bright, but instead more muted which is very attractive and makes them look more upscale. The biggest benefit is they expand well at the bottom providing a lot of space and strong support. So they fit a lot and are durable, making them more practical and useful than regular manila file folders that don't hold much. I'm very happy with them.",

I especially like this product because I think the seller went the extra mile by boxing them in a handy reusable container instead of being wrapped in cellophane. Keeps the still-to-be used folders neatly confined in an easy access box. Love this simple detail. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing\u201d",

They have the tabs in three different locations so that they can be lined up in a filing cabinet without blocking each other. They come in a very sturdy cardboard box that will make them easy to store.I bought the traditional manila color, and am now a little sorry that I didn't order the pastel colors. In hindsight I see they would have been useful for keeping track of the various projects I use folders for. But even without that feature, these will be very useful. I can always use colored labels or stickers to identify groups. I am the president of a small volunteer organization and, when we're busy, I go through file folders as if they were candy, so I'm delighted to have them.",
