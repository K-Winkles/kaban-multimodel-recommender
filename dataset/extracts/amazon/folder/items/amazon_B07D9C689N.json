                "reviewText": "The only thing I didn't like is the bottom of the file inside there's a small space between the accordion fold where smaller things I have such as certain business cards fall through a bit and go into the next compartment/section/file. Otherwise papers fit perfectly and are kept very neat. The zipper is slightly larger than a normal zipper making it easier to open which I appreciate. Color and material is nice, definitely seems weather proof from current observations but have not tested for accuracy. Plenty of room and good amount of storage. Definitely like this folder apart from the small inconvenience of the bottom portion. I can understand if that part was left with a slight opening to allow more storage and use less material but I would have liked to keep business cards and small papers in as well without them mixing.",
