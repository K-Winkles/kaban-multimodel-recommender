                "reviewText": "These folders are made of sturdy and durable material. They are bendable but unlike other cheap alternatives they do no break. These are perfect for school, office or home and are super lightweight. The style is modern and the pastel colors are so cute. I love that the inside pockets provide additional support with upper corner flaps that hold papers in place even when opening the folders. The binder holes fit perfectly.Overall very well made. Great value for the price.",
