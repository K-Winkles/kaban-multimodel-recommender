                "reviewText": "I need a binder for taking notes but I wanted one with a thin form factor that would stay shut when I closed it. Ordinary ring binders wouldn't do, as they are too thick and don't stay closed, but this was great!Obviously if you fill it up with paper in the organizer section it will get bulkier but for general purposes note taking and organizing documents this is perfect. It's slim so it fits in my bag, I just have to be careful not to overstuff it.I was delighted that it actually came with a note pad! Ready to use right out of the box. I love the toothpaste mint color.",
