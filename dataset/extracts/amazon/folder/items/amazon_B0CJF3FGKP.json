The paper folders I have, the pockets are barely 8.5 inches wide, causing the sheets of paper edges to fold when the folder is closed. These folder pockets are wide enough to prevent this.",

                "reviewText": "These folders are great for my use. They are just slightly thinner than what I'm used to in plastic folders They are still plenty thick enough to be sturdy. I frequently use these folders in 3-ring binders. I punch holes in the edge and insert them in the 3-ring binder. I like this way of doing it because I can easily pull out the papers I need at the time and I don't have this massive binder taking up most of my desk space when I'm working. Being just slightly thinner, they work very well in my 3-ring binder. My favorite part of these folders is their color. The pastel shades of the folders are in sharp contrast to the usual bold colors of most plastic folders. It is a refreshing change. The fact that these folders are made from recycled materials is a definite plus.",

They fit 8 1/2\" x 11\" papers and have the capacity for about 1/2\" of material. I like that if they are sitting on my desk, you cannot easily see what I am working on. As a rule, I tape business cards to the inside of my folders as it is easy for one to slip out and get lost due to their size. In my experience, the thickness of the plastic used in this product is thicker than similar products.",

My wife and daughter quickly claimed a couple as they suddenly needed folders too, lol. They are bendable but keep their shape firmly. Two inside liner pockets keep your papers in place with no slippage. The exterior is water resistant. Going to need to order a second set. Universal in application, from school to work and home, they fit right in and look fantastic.",

                "reviewText": "This Bright Color set contains five pocket folders in the following colors: red, orange, yellow, green and blue. The colors very vibrant. The set comes in a clear plastic sleeve. There is no advertising on the sleeve. There is only the Amazon bar code and it states made in China. Each folder has no writing on it. I find these folders to be thinner than other plastic folders I own. They are advertised as 100% recycled plastic so perhaps that is why? There is a business card slot on the inside left pocket of each folder. These are ideal for protecting documents from moisture but I would not recommend using them for documents that need to be protected from wrinkling due to the thinness. I would also not recommend trying to store 50 sheets of paper in each pocket. I do not think that would be practical use for this product, and I think it would distort the thin flexible plastic.",
