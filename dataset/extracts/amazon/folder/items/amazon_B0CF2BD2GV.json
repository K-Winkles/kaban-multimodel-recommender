The prongs are great, as you can keep your 3-hole punched papers securely inside, as well as put papers in the pockets. These are not the plastic kind, but the coated cardstock type. The colors are shocking pink, blue, green, yellow, and orange. (In the product pics, it looks like you get red, not pink. I prefer the pink, so yay!) There are 10 of each color.They seem to be holding up so far, so they seem well-made. I was a bit leery because of them being made of cardstock and not plastic, however they seem to be pretty strong. I have had the plastic ones just come apart; these will not do that. I was worried they would rip easily, but they aren't.Very pleased with these!",

It's hard to write a review on them unless they're absolutely terrible, or I've had them so long they've proven they're unusually sturdy.They're paper, so I'm guessing they won't hold up over a long period of time, but that's why I got fifty of them. And honestly, they lose stuff like this so often I don't even want plastic ones. My kids go through folders like they're toilet paper. If your kids are in their school years, a fifty-pack of folders is not excessive. If I'd been paying more attention, I probably would have ordered the 100- or 125-pack instead.",
