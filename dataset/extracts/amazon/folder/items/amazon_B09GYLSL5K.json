                "reviewText": "We are unexpectedly caregiving for a family member, and our old 'home health' folder very quickly fell apart as we added more and more doctor and hospital visits, with all of their notes and appointment reminders, etc. This gives me room to organize by topic or doctor, and the clear pocket on front gives me a place to put a list of all doctors with their addresses and phone numbers. It will make going to appointments so much easier - just grab the binder and everything is organized and in one place. Love this little binder! - UPDATE: I've since bought three more binders to manage documents for other family members. It's perfect.",
