The clipboard provides ample support to write without the binder needing to be completely full. The rings are strong, aligned well, and have opening tabs that make opening easy. The included dividers and binder pockets are of decent quality. The front and rear binder pockets offer sufficient flex without being weak. The pen holder is thoughtfully placed to the outside of the securing strap ribbon rivets. My only issue with this binder is the sharpness of the edging. I will likely cover the edges with a coordinating color or clear tape to smooth out the edges. Overall, this is a well-built and thoughtfully designed organizer at a very good price and I definitely would recommend it.",

I am a tournament Scrabble player and am using this binder to hold all of my study materials and word lists as I switch over to Collins from NWL (for those not familiar with word nerd speak, I am learning a new lexicon).The envelopes and loose-leaf paper are all good quality and stay in place on the binder rings well. The clipboard clamp on the front cover is strong and holds paper in place well.I use the clipboard to hold my score sheets while playing practice games with my partner who is also switching to Collins. For the time being, we're playing with access to the cheat sheets and this clipboard/binder is perfect for allowing quick and easy access to my study sheets while playing. When we're almost ready to start doing tournaments in Collins we'll stop using the cheat sheets during play and rely solely on our brains, but we aren't there yet and I love this binder for practice sessions.",

The clipboard on the front is a nice touch. They also include some sticker tabs in the inside. I wish the pocket folders matched the over all color and design of the binder.Probably going to have to hide this binder when my mom comes to visit because I know she is going to want it. The price is decent. I do like the plastic cover the one thing I would add would be to have the front have a pocket so you can slide things into the cover.",

                "reviewText": "I am using this binder to organize handouts for some related courses I'm taking. The sturdy dividers are perfect for separating the information for each course. Everything is exactly as described. Each piece is very sturdy and the loose-leaf paper included is smooth. The clipboard on the front is handy for the few handouts I am working on at a time. There are a couple things that could be improved, but it's not enough to remove a star in my opinion:-The waterproof cover is sealed at the edges of the binder. In some places it's a little rough and could possibly snag.-Because the edges are rough in some places, the elastic closure could wear faster. There are no signs of wear as yet; and only time will tell with this.-The pen loop is just a small bit of the same material used to laminate the binder. In my experience, loops like that don't last long before ripping but again, time will tell. Because there is a pouch included in the binder, I'm not too worried about this.Overall this is a complete binder system and seems really durable. I can see it lasting me for many courses throughout the years.",

The outside has a clip board feature, that a paper tablet or document can be attached to allowing the binder to be used for a clipboard. The inside of the binder covers both have clear pockets in them. Included is a small amount of loose leaf paper. There are five colored dividers, all with pockets on both sides. And there are pastel tabs that you can label your dividers with. The pockets can hold generous size document or magazine. The last page is an envelope and you can store any miscellaneous items you have along with your business card. There is an elastic on the back side of the binder that you just loop around the binder to keep it closed. I really like the colors and design of this binder and will be able to use it for multiple tasks at work.",
