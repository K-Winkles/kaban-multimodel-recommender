                "reviewText": "It's a fine filer but the labels fall out of their holders and the paper pockets are somewhat flimsy. The tab holder is open on both the top and bottom. The paper pockets are a little too thin to keep papers in place. For a folder where you'll store documents you don't need to look at often (for me, it's bank statements and credit card agreements) it's great. If you're thinking of using it for filing school or work documents that you will be leafing through often, it's not quite sturdy enough to keep your papers in place.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the SMEAD Poly ten-pocket folder. So far I have used it to organize HR documentation, such as medical plans and 401K details. This Poly pocket folder is helpful for someone who is starting a new job who needs to organize a number of on-boarding documents. Students could also use this folder to store lecture notes for various classes. Individuals could also store printed copies of recipes in the folder. Also, individuals could store all their travel information (such as tickets, itineraries, receipts, hotel details and maps) in the folder since it can hold more documentation than a traditional two-pocket folder. Since the folder has ten pockets, it's able to hold up to 25 sheets. It also includes tabs so you can easily subdivide documents. I like that the folder is durable and sturdy. It won't tear. In my book, this is a great product!",
