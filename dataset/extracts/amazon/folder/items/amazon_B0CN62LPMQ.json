                "reviewText": "I got this to organize my greeting cards. I often check out the car aisle & buy a bunch of cards at a time. I've got dozens on them & currently keep them in a couple of shoe boxes. It's gotten tiresome sorting through them all to find the perfect card for my needs.I'd bought a ard sorter with dividers but it isn't large enough to hold all of the cards I have. Also, it's designed for standard sized cards. I have some that are large & oddly shaped, so they don't fit. I'm determined to have all of my cars in one place.This accordion file organizer can expand to accept more cards & shrink back when there are fewer cards. It is able to hold all of my cards. I appreciate that the manufacturers included labels that are blank so I can label the dividers according to my needs.I wish that this had a lid. I know that would be difficult with a file that expands & contracts but I'll bet some creative person could come up with a design. I'll try to find something that will fit since this will be sitting on a shelf long-term & I don't want the cards to collect dust. If I were using it as a file, I don't think I'd want that to collect dust either. Since files also tend to hold things long-term, one wouldn't want those items to get dusty either. Maybe the manufacturers could come up with a solution for covering the file. Anyway, I really love it & would definitely recommend it to others.",

                "reviewText": "Arrives wrapped in plastic with a Made in China barcode sticker407g (14.36oz)Black with 12 tabs on the inside in 6 different colors - this technically gives you 13 pockets to store things, but one pocket does not have a tab to label itThe organizer is 13\" wide x 9.5\" tall. It is 1/2 inch thick when empty but expands to 12\" to hold papers. There is a black elastic band that you can use to hold everything together but I found it difficult to get around the accordion when it was empty, and it also limits how many papers you can put in the accordion to maybe 3 inches. I won't be using that for long before I need more than 3\" of storageIt also has a pocket on the front which comes with card paper so you can label what you are storing insideIt comes with 27 stickers which you can write on and attach to the tabs to help you keep organized - 12 of them are pre-printed with month abbreviations, the others you can easily write on what ever you wantA dozen is a few tabs short for what I needed, but I was able to put file folders in some of the tabs to increase my number of categories I have available to classify expenses. One thing I found cool about this accordion organizer is that the separating tabs are attached not only at the sides, but also to the bottom, so you have a true pocket - my receipts won't be slipping out of their category and into another one. For that this gets a 5 stars",

                "reviewText": "This plastic file organizer is accordion style so you can fit a lot of papers inside it or just a few and it can expand or collapse depending how full it is. Even with a lot of papers inside, it compacts down to a slim profile, and I love the rainbow color file separators. It comes with month labels for the tabs. It also has an elastic band on the back that you can wrap around the front in order to keep it collapsed, but it will generally stay extended or collapsed with or without the band. The front also has a pocket you can put a label in. Definitely a great addition to any office. It is designed for US letter size paper but can still hold 12\"x12\" scrapbook paper, too, though it's taller than the tabs.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a file organizer to file letter size documents Wanted to file guarantees, instruction books, notices, etc. This file organizer is fine for my home use. It is made of \"Polypropylene\" which I would call plastic. While good for home use, I would not use it for business use in my formal office (Yes, I am a high quality snob).Each of the 12 pockets will hold about 1/2 inch of letter size papers (normal 20 to 24 lb stock). The unit does stand upright and his an elastic band which can wrap around the entire unit to collapse it when empty or holding a few papers. It is has very colorful tabs and a black outside (which I really like). Adhesive \"stick on\" tabs preprinted with Jan- to Dec and 27 blank stickers are multicolored. I will use my label machine to produce tabs.i would characterize the organizer as medium-high quality which would be useful and suitable for most who need a file organizer. The organizer is as described.",

I save my husband\u2019s work expense receipts all year and this folder helps me to easily file them. Once I\u2019m done with the folder I\u2019m able to tightly close it back together and file in a small space on my shelf instead of taking up a bunch of room. It\u2019s very handy.",

                "reviewText": "It holds a lot, but there is no flap going across the top to close it. The elastic wraps around the middle but not across the top, so taking it with you in a bag could be an issue. And the elastic is pretty tight, so I don't think you could have it all the way full and put the elastic around it.",
