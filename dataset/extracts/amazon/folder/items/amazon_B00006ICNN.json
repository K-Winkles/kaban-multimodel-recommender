I like the fact that because they are closed off on 3 ends, everything, regardless of size, is kept securely together. This allows me the option to forgo the hanging file folders and just place these upright in a box for easy access. The tab on top is plenty big for labels.Smead claims that the flat version can hold up to 50 pages. I have not counted how many pages max I've put into these, but I am inclined to believe that number is possible, depending on how thick your paper is, of course. There is a slight bulge when you fit in more pages, but it doesn't affect the function of these file jackets.The quality of these file jackets are excellent. The material feel durable, and I don't see quality control issues like loose glue or misaligned folds.",
