                "reviewText": "I subtracted 1 star because the listing says 12-pack but in reality you only receive a 10-pack. So if you need 12, you're out of luck with this one. The photos and the text doesn't match, and I only noticed this after receiving the items. The photos are only showing 10 envelopes, while the text says it's a 12-pack.The envelopes themselves are great, nice looking with awesome colors. Nothing to complain about there. I also love the little \"button\" for closure, instead of cheap velcro.",
