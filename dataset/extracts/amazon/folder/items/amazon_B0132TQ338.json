I liked that there is no obvious product logo imprinted in anywhere that takes away from the clean look of the folder, the stickers peel off easily.The clear polypropylene has a slightly satin finish micro texture, where your contents inside are slightly blurred. I wanted this effect, I didn\u2019t need crystal clear smooth glossy finish which would inevitably get scratched up or fingerprint marked with normal use. These stay clean looking and let you preview the contents or cover pages just fine.Metal tabs / prongs are strong and durable too.I used these to hold clear heavy duty weight sheet protectors (which are also tricky to find ones without logos on the hinge strip area - try Target Up&Up brand if you are seeking those). Great for archival photo and document storage, and for printed artwork or project portfolios.",
