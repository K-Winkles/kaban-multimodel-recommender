                "reviewText": "Are you too cheap to pay to have your presentation materials professionally printed and bound but still want those to whom you are presenting to understand that you are a professional who cares deeply about whatever you are presenting? Well, if so, I would like to suggest that these Avery Two-Pocket Folders are just the product for you. They are well made, pleasant to the touch, and are hefty enough to hold even the most robust of under-40 page presentations not worth having professionally printed and bound. True, folks may still question why you didn't just have the presentation spiral bound by a professional printer, but they won't be able to question your commitment to the very best of the second best. Indeed, they may very well take your presentation out of the folder, toss it in the trash where it most likely belongs if it wasn't worth professionally binding, and then use the folder for their own presentation needs of secondary importance. In that sense, you can think of these folder as perks for your potential clients.The only real downside is that Avery very cleverly embossed their own logo on the back of the folder. So your branding will be all muddled up with another major corporation's branding. They'd never get away with that on printing labels, but they somehow think that's okay on these folders. I called their home office to inquire about this, and they said that if I really cared about my branding I'd pay to have my presentation professionally printed and bound. Touch\u00e9, Avery, touch\u00e9. (Okay, I didn't actually call their home office, but I did imagine doing so vividly in my imagination and that was a very accurate account of what transpired.)",
