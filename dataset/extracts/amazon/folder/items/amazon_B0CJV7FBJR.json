                "reviewText": "Product: KTRIO Plastic File Folders, Clear Project Pockets, Transparent Plastic Sleeves, L-Type Documents Folders Jacket, Paper Sheet Protectors for Office School, Fits for Letter SizeSold by Ktrio LLC - Shipped from AmazonPurchased on Received May 3, 2023Reviewed on June 5, 2023I got the Plastic File Folders to use a dry erase marker (most plastics work with dry erase markers) on the printable checklists I use for Cleaning and Planning. I already use sheet protectors for my generic weekly & monthly planner pages that I keep in a notebook, but I wanted something firmer that hold up better. I wanted a good quality, non-porous plastic that was firmer than a heavy duty page protector. If the Plastic File Folders did not work for this purpose, I could still use the them as regular folders in the Paper Action Center I plan to set up. Either way they would not go to waste.I was very pleased with the feel of the folders when they got here. They are very smooth and seem to be a good quality plastic (better than the average lamination - thicker and stronger than a heavy duty page protector). When empty they look cloudy, but when you put something in it you can see it very clearly like the cloudy plastic becomes a clear plastic. I have decided to chalk it up to the same kind of magic that causes a light to come on when you flip the wall switch and not worry about why/how it works.To test its dry erase capability, I put my latest Daily Cleaning Checklist in one of the plastic file folders clip it into the clipboard and use a black dry erase marker to checked everything on the list. The marker went on well and erased without leaving any residue. So, I checked them again and waited 24 hours to erase the Morning and Evening Daily List - after a full week I erased the Weekly List - after one month (31 days) I erased the Monthly List. The result for all of them was that the black dry erase marks came off easily without leaving any residue, though I had to rub a little harder for the monthly marks. I used a dry 100% cotton dish towel to rub off the marks.Whether you want these to use as plain folders or to as dry erase pocket sleeves these work excellently. I am using them for both, they are perfect to for use in my hanging folders to separate the main category into smaller ones and being clear it is easy to find the group you are looking for. As a folder it will easily hold up to 30 sheets (you can cram in a few more if you need to) of 8.5 x 11 inch (letter size) computer paper with is plenty for most things.I ordered the 12 to try but will definitely order more next time!",

                "reviewText": "I love these, they were exactly what I was looking for. They are clear plastic, not a frosted look. They are thin and bendable, but once you put your papers inside, the cover holds up well. They are thicker than the plastic protectors with the 3 ring binder holes, but thinner than a traditional plastic folder. I use these to hold bills, reference charts, my kids' homework, and nothing gets \"lost\" inside folders or piles. It keeps our household papers in neat stacks and you can clearly see what's inside.",

                "reviewText": "These file folders are semi-transparent, making it easy to identify the documents inside at a glance, which is quite convenient. Their size also perfectly matches the common letter size. However, the downside for me is that they are just too soft, offering minimal protection for documents. If you simply place documents in the folder and then into a briefcase, they hardly stay flat. Additionally, considering their quality (very thin and soft) and the quantity (only 6), I find their unit price a bit expensive.",
