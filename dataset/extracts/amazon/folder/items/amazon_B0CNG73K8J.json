                "reviewText": "I ordered the CreaNex Plastic File Folders because my paper files would get damaged every time I took them out of the file cabinet. The plastic feels a bit thinner than other plastic file folders that I used at the office and also thinner than the colored cardboard files that I have. It does seem to be more durable than the colored cardboard files. It resists bending and It bounces back when I try to bend the plastic. However, I did expect the files to be a bit thicker. My file cabinet does look much neater. I put the files I use most often in plastic folders because they get damaged the most. These plastic folders do have lines along the bottom so that you can expand them just as the cardboard ones do.The labels that came with the set are plastic also. This makes them easy to peel off and reset without tearing the label or folder if it is placed crookedly. I like this feature because the folders can be reused if a file is no longer needed. However, the labels are shorter than a popular name brand label which is paper (see photo). I really wish the labels were longer. I need more space on most of my file labels. There is plenty of room on the tab why did they shorten the label? For this reason and because they are a bit thinner than expected, I rated it 4 star.",

I wanted a few sturdy and also colorful folders so I can easily see which one to grab \u2013 like green for financial stuff, blue for receipts, etc. These folders are perfect for this! Very happy with them.The 12 pack gives you two folders of each color (6 colors total). Material is a thin flexible plastic that\u2019s stronger than the typical manila folder. But they still have the standard 3 lines at the bottom where you can re-fold them to accommodate bigger or smaller contents. Also like classic manila folders, the tabs are 1/3 cut, meaning in differing places \u2013 left, center, right \u2013 so you can alternate them in a drawer to view the labels. They come with a total of 24 stick on labels in matching colors.",

                "reviewText": "I love plastic file folders compared to the typical paper ones. I organize my financial papers, my vacation plans, my medical info, and so on, and I used to use regular paper file folders. They fray and the tabs get bent over. These plastic ones are long lasting, and the tabs hold their structure so you can easily find the folder you are looking for. These folders come in nice cheerful colors that help you quickly identify the one you are needing. Labels are included to affix to the tabs. These file folders almost make organizing your papers fun!",

                "reviewText": "These plastic file folders are exactly the same size as your everyday heavy paper file folders. They also have 3 fold lines across the bottom of one side that will enable me to expand the folders to hold files up to nearly 1\" thick - that's a lot of pages. The best thing is that these are going to last forever and can be reused just by changing the label - I don't expect I'll ever have to replace them. I'll just need a few more to accommodate the rest of my files.",
