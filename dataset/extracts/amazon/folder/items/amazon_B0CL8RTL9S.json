                "reviewText": "I got this set of folders for my 8-year-old son to store and organize his school and homework documents. He carries these folders in his backpack to school and home every day. We have been using the regular paper/cardboard folders and they would not last more than a couple of weeks!We were looking for something more durable for him to store his school and homework documents. These folders are in pastel colors, and they look nice and feel sturdy. The two pockets are deep and fit the regular letter size and sometimes slightly bigger drawing sheets. The folders also have three holes to fit 3-ring binders. The corners are rounded and are safe for kids.We have been using them for a week and so far, the folders are holding up great. They are reasonably priced and are good value for money. I will update my review after a few more weeks of usage.",
