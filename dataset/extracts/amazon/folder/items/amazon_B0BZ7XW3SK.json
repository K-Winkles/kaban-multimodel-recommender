                "reviewText": "I purchased these 12.8\" X 9.2\" plastic envelopes to get and stay organized for an 11 day Girl Scout trip. Each day had it's own folder with our schedule, the little 3 X 5\" lanyard schedules for each scouts lanyard, our printed tour / activity confirmations along with any relevant correspondences, the badge requirements we would be working on each day, balances due, thank you cards, tip envelopes & a pencil & pen. I loved that these folders had a button closure feature. The handy dandy little pocket window and insert on the front of each folder gave me a space to pencil in the day, date and reminder to bring our troop checkbook and CC each day. They worked great. I used folder #12 for leader paperwork that I had to take with us each day such as the full schedule for the entire trip, each travelers health history forms, Emergency phone list & Troop Roster. Negative: The snaps broke on 2 folders but it was oddly on the lesser stuffed folders (only like 5 & 8 sheets of paper in each) so I think it was unfortunately a defect or poor quality for those 2 button closures. Despite that, I think these were a great investment and definitely helped me to keep things in order.",
