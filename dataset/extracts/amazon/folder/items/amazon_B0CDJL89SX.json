These Mr. Pen plastic folders are a good addition to my collection.I appreciate the varied colors included (peach, pink, yellow, and 2 shades of green to my eye), as it makes it easier to grab the right folder if I'm in a hurry. The construction is solid, and I expect these will last just as long as the reinforced paper folders I typically use. And I'm not sure I'll need the built-in pockets, but it is a handy feature to have. Highly recommended.",

These are just what they say they are -- two pocket folders with three prongs in the center for hole punched paper. The plastic is nice and sturdy and they hold a good amount of paper. I prefer plastic because I can wipe down the outside which is important because I used one for old family recipes that are in plastic sleeves. I can also tuck things in the pockets. I like the colors because they are different and not the standard colors. The muted colors are fun and I will definitely know which folder to grab just based on the color.

It appears that each of the report covers will hold 40-50 pages. The set comes with 5 different colors, so it's easy to grab the specific print-out you need.
