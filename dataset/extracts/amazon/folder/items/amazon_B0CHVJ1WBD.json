The zippers on it are heavy duty and hefty - they don't feel cheap. This is quite professional looking, especially with its handles, it feels very much like a briefcase without being as bulky as a briefcase. It's very sturdy. I'm not sure if this is fireproof or waterproof, but it certainly feels like it could be. The outside has a rubberized feel which makes it a magnet for cat and dog hair.I'm using it to put the important papers for my work in it.",

I don't plan to test out it's fire-proof claim but I've taken it out when snowing heavy and/or raining and I can say it's relatively waterproof in that kind of setting.I'm not a fan of the material itself as it looks and feels weird but it's probably fire-resistant material so it's a minor issue. It doesn't look or feel premium at all but at its price, it's not a premium product. It does the job so I can't really knock it down much. Can't speak on the durability as I've not used it too long yet but will update as I keep using it.Overall, it's not a bad price for the item and I would recommend this to others.",
