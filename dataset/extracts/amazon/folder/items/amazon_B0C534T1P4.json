No holes to punch, no tab to open/close which is a time saver. I use this to present treatment plan, informed consent, and financial agreement for orthodontic patients contemplating getting braces. By holding this folder instead of stapled stacked of paper, they take it more seriously of what they're about to sign. Highly recommend.",

This gives you a nice corner to snug your papers into.These have a handy thumb hole to make it easy to open them up.They are well made and the plastic is thick enough to withstand some wear.I have used similar folders for many years. They are super handy for quick access since you can see the documents inside. The many colors in this pack also make it easy to find documents in a hurry.",
