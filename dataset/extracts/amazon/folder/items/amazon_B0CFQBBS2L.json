Good purchase, would recommend!",

It\u2019s a great cost for what I needed it for. The only down fall is don\u2019t keep anything to large in the zipper portion of the binder. It will cause the binder to become bulky and difficult to write on. I like how easy it is to take papers in and out of. I will definitely purchase again when it becomes dirty. Fabric is hard to clean",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Lovely, high quality folio binder at a great price!",
                "reviewText": "This is a REALLY nice binder - very good quality and I like it a lot. LOTS of positives with this! The fabric is really nice and it has an upscale look and feel to it, especially with the gold color clip and quality cotton, linen cloth. It's great for organizing and with the two pockets on the inner front and back as well, it's actually capable of holding three different pads of paper at one time (if you actually wanted it to). I have no idea why the photos say the back inner pocket is expandable though - as it is not. Another feature I really love is the large, clear plastic zipper pouch in the very back behind all the inner plastic files. That has REALLY come in handy in a way I never expected for all sorts of small items, like sticky notes, rubber bands, paper clips, pens, pencils, etc. I basically use it as my notebook \"junk drawer\". ;-) It comes with a generous amount of labels for the file folders too, which is nice. I also LOVE that it has an elastic band to hold the folio closed, which I honestly do not know what I would do without. It's really sturdy as well.This elastic band also, however, brings me to the \"downsides\", which is why I unfortunately am giving this only 4 stars instead of 5 stars. This band is absolutely REQUIRED to secure the pad on the front when it is being moved around, yet the pad is still not protected from getting knocked askew or completely off, or even mangled during any kind of transport. And it simply feels too time consuming to have to remove the pad and place it inside the binder in between any major transport. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to have the paper pad on the front without a cover.What would honestly make this entire design PERFECT, is a third cover to place over the front pad cover. Or another option could be to have a second elastic band, to secure the inner file folders while using a pad with the clip inside the cover, instead on the outside front (hope I'm making sense!) As for the inner files themselves, I think they should all be either darker rainbow colors, or all pastel colors. The red one in the front just did not blend color pallet wise with the others, so I actually cut it out completely with scissors. My eyes simply couldn't handle the color clash - I can't stand pink and red together, but I also realize that's just me. My third negative is the pen holder. Though I LOVE that it even has a pen holder, it sticks out and hangs about in an awkward fashion to where it gets in the way and gets caught on things. I think it ought to be sewn into the inner seam facing inward, so that the pen would then be securely tucked into the folio instead. Though the paper pad it comes with is cute being pink and all, the paper peeled (or rather fell) right off of the backing almost immediately. Color wise, I wish there were more choices, as I'm not THAT crazy about any of the options. I do like the green okay, but I'd LOVE to have it in brown, beige, or a sage green!Overall, it is a great product for the $21 price though!! And it is definitely a handy office product for organizational purposes and everyday practical use if you aren't planning on transporting it much! So I would recommend it. I had a REALLY hard time deciding between 4 or 5 stars on this one. But in the end, I simply had to factor in all the little things that frustrated me a bit. Do keep in mind it is ONLY spiral bound, so you cannot add anything to it in that way - no 3 ring binder, hole punched notebook paper additions are available in this folio. Everything simply goes in the files.",
