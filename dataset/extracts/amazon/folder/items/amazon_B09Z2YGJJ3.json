                "reviewText": "This is the only product I have found with vertical lines on a file folder. There are no attachments needed, it is all one item. That means there's nothing for me to lose or misplace! All of my notes can be written throughout the service and are literally part of the file. They are your standard size, so many papers fit inside. They seem pretty durable. I have been using them for about 6 months and so far they've held up well. I use erasable ink. This paper product seems to hold this ink well, it does not disappear over time... Or it hasn't yet. The only downside to these files are the price. They are quite costly. But, in the end, the price is almost a wash as I don't have to purchase other items to put inside. For me it is worth the extra money to keep everything together and important notes not at risk of being lost.They come in four different colors. I had to wait quite some time for individual packs of only the blue color. If you are a color coder, these are for you. The product is exactly as it is portrayed. The colors are bright and easy to identify. I will continue to purchase this product.",
