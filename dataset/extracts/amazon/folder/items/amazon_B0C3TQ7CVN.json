One small thing of note is that it does not open completely flat due to where the zipper stops. That I didn't find to be a huge issue. What I did find to be a deal breaker and cause me to return this item are the card sleeves. They Do Not fit a social security card. They are too narrow. Considering that this is the only type of card I need to store, it made this binder useless to me. If the manufacturer had made these sleeves like a quarter of an inch wider it would have been perfect.",
