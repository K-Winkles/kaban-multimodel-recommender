                "reviewText": "On my kid's school supply list, they needed a 'ShowFile.' I had ABSOLUTELY no idea what that was. I found this 10 pocket file folder & I'm pretty confident that this should do the trick.The way the 10 pockets are counted/constructed is as follows -- front cover - with a pocket on the inside of the front cover- 4 pages - with a pocket on each side of the page to insert papers- back cover - with a pocket on the inside of the back coverThis isn't meant to hold a ton of pages & again, but I'm sure the teachers are aware of the capacity of these.As long as there are 'enough pockets' to fit your needs, this was a more than adequate solution",
