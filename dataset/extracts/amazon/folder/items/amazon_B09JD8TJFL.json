                "reviewText": "I needed pink folders for a summer event and these worked perfectly. They are a thicker plastic material compared to what you find in big box stores so they are more durable. The downside is they don\u2019t lay as flat because they are thicker. But I didn\u2019t care about that - I needed durability and these held up so well!",
