                "reviewText": "Simple, inexpensive and professional looking. I bought this and a different set of note taking paper better for job interviews. The paper it comes with is just basic lined paper which is fine, but I feel like I look more professional with better paper. The portfolio is pretty durable as well, and the internal pocket is big enough to hold a few copies of your resume. That said, I wouldn\u2019t go more than four or five sheets of paper. This is just a simple portfolio for maybe a meeting, job interview or some other short term use. Great item though, glad I bought it!",

                "reviewText": "I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this clipboard. I got the foldback version, and it does indeed fold back fully. The leather material doesn't feel thin or cheap, like it will flake or tear like many low-cost Chinese products. Also, unlike another version I own, this one fully covers the clip area and doesn't have a cut-out in the front flap, exposing that area to the elements. Since the padding gives the clipboard some thickness, holding it on the side when folded back creates an excellent thick, rounded grip that feels ergonomic, unlike holding on to a thin, rigid metal or particle board slab. Overall, I highly recommend this leather folio clipboard. I use mine for doodling on loose sheets of paper.",
