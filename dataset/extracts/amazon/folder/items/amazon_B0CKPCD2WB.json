While they are not the stiffest, they should last for a good while, as they are going to sit in a file cabinet most of the time. They will hold a fair amount of stuff (more than I need them to) and I love that the 6 gentle pastel colors are great for color coding, and will contrast nicely with the bright and dark colored hanging folders that I have. For heavier use, a more substantial kind of paper would be preferable, but for ordinary use, these are fine. Looking forward to greater ease in locating important papers when needed, quickly and with a little less frustration.",

                "reviewText": "These folders come in a generous sized package and I really appreciate the colored options for ease of filing. Cost is approx. 50 cents per folder.However, these are so thin. One could use them more as separators and markers than for very many papers. I think that taking them in and out repeatedly with many papers in them they will wear out quickly. As a matter of fact some of them arrived dog-earred and appear somewhat faded in color. Price is great but you are getting what you pay for. Not quite up to the task for me.",

                "reviewText": "My home office needs have diminished since I'm all-but-totally retired, and over the last several years I've been reusing old manila file folders when I need to make new ones (like a folder for current-year tax information each January). By now, though, the folders I bought 40-or-so years ago are looking pretty ratty; the tabs are frayed and worn thin from using, removing and replacing labels. This package of 24 pretty pastel folders, then, seemed to be the perfect way to update going forward.And they're quite nice. Mind you, I'll take issue with the description of \"thick paper\" and \"heavyweight\" - they're probably not as sturdy as the standard manila folders I got all those years ago. On the other hand, they're not super-thin, and they'll work just fine for what I need. There are six colors (my selection is the pastel Macaron group), with four folders in each shade. Standard 8-1/2 x 11-inch sheets fit inside, and the bottoms are scored so as to be expanded.",

                "reviewText": "These are the flimsiest file folders I\u2019ve ever seen. If you look at my last two pics you can compare these to the very last pic which is a typical file folder from an office supply store. I\u2019m holding them both the same way and this folder just falls completely open while the other folder is stiff. I can\u2019t believe they use the term heavyweight in the description. It should say lightweight. These really are not much thicker than good quality paper. They are thinner than greeting card material. I suppose there\u2019s a use for these if you don\u2019t access the folders frequently, such as storing old paperwork and taxes. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll use these for. But they will not hold up to routine use in a filing cabinet. If you need regular stock file folders, keep looking. These are not them.",
