Wish they came in more colors, especially more unusual colors like orange, bright green (lime), black, etc. Also like that you can buy a good quantity without getting an entire box of 100.Standard weight for a plain manilla folder, useful for organizing papers in a file cabinet. (The tap does extend a little ways above a hanging folder, so not an \"internal\" folder, however.)",
