You can put in your own coversheet so it's easy to personalize. The tabs are large and the color-coding is great.My only feedback is that the interior pockets could have a small gusset to fit more papers at once, but overall I'm very happy with it and would definitely recommend it or buy it again. It's a great value for the money.",
