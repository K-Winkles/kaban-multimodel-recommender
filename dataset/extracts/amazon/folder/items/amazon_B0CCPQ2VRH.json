These Mr. Pen plastic folders are a good addition to my collection.I appreciate the varied colors included (violet, gray, gold, blue/green, and a muted red to my eye), as it makes it easier to grab the right folder if I'm in a hurry. The construction is solid, and I expect these will last just as long as the reinforced paper folders I typically use. And I'm not sure I'll need the built-in pockets, but it is a handy feature to have. Highly recommended.",
