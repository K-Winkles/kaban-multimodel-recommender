I have a few leather portfolios but I find them very bulky and this one allows me to use a smaller backpack to leave my hands free to work. I love that is black outside but a lighter color inside which makes it easier on the eye for finding the forms, you need. Is a softer than leather material but it is study. Absolutely recommend for ay traveling, nurses, sign language interpreters, traveling therapists, etc.",

It can fit right into my very slim ipad holder perfectly. It's ideal for just a few papers that are important that you don't want to get wrinkled. It's not intended to carry a ton of stuff, but more or less if you were taking just a few important docs to sign to a client but you didn't want to lug around a whole lot. It's very stylish. I like the orange because i'm not boring, but i did get the conservative gray also for the moments when i guess i should be more subtle.",

The folders are tough, and so take about a week before they reshape to carry large numbers of documents.There is a little window on the inside of the cover flap that is pretty handy - i use it to label different classes, really helpful to keep things organized.I will definitely be purchasing more of these, not sure that I will need to repurchase them soon\u2026 they are really durable.Love that they come in multiple colours.Great product.
