                "reviewText": "This accordion folder does the job exactly as I hoped. The outside of this folder is a very nice looking pattern, looks a bit like carbon fiber, very cool. The interior has multiple sleeves, so it does a good job of gobbling up a lot of papers.The quality of this accordion folder is good, it looks like it will hold itself together once I fill it up with paperwork and receipts. This is one of the more fancy looking accordion folders I have ever had. It is made out of good looking plastic materials, the sleeves are nice quality and are firmly planted inside this folder. The different colors for the sleeves I find to be very very useful, much better then the regular ones where the internal sleeves are all clear.This accordion folder has a solid piece of elastic as the closer, that looks like it will hold the folder closed once you seal it up. The outer casing looks like carbon fiber and has a nice heavy weight feel to it, feels very sturdy and ready to do its job quietly and confidentially. If you like a bit of style in your office then you will be happy with this product.",
