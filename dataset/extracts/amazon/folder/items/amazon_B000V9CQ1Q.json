We put all their \u201cto do\u201dpapers in one pocket, extra supplies in another and have a done pocket as well (and various other uses per class). Works really well for langauge arts that has lots of different parts (reading, writing, spelling, phonics, etc) there is a pocket for each portion.",

I purchased two more for my managers and they use them consistently as well.",
