                "reviewText": "I have always kept my most important things in an old briefcase to be able to grab in an emergency. The briefcase was easy to grab, but it was much larger, heavier and more disorganized with only 3 filing slots and a big open area.This case is designed with many small and large places to store various items and easily find them. Many of the slots are covered with mesh so that you can see where everything is, if you don't have them contained within the paper-sized alphabetical slots. I counted the individual \"places\" to store items. There are 14 separate places that fit documents, 9 mesh pockets ranging from very small to 1 pocket that has a zipper for the area and mesh on about 1/3 of the area. Then you have another 6 places for items like credit cards.When we travel, especially in our RV, we always grabbed the briefcase before, so that we have emergency items like our eyeglass prescriptions, our dogs' health records, various travel-related cards, and other odd personal items.This expanding folder will be a major improvement as the items are stored in a smaller, lighter and much more orderly fashion. I do feel that the covering has substance, and I believe that it will be much more fire-resistant than the briefcase we used.",

                "reviewText": "Not bad for $29.98. It isn't quite as firm and structured looking as the product photos. It is a little bit more loose, kind of like a cloth/zippered binder. I like this organizer though. I can keep documents and passports- there are dividers that can be velcroed to keep your documents secure. You can use the alphabetized tab labels or you could create your own tabs with different names/colors if you needed something else. There are a lot of pockets of various sizes, one with a zipper, some internal. The double zipper allows the organizer to lay flat, and you could also use a small lock hooking the two zipper tabs together to keep out prying eyes. The fact that it is fireproof, waterproof and dust proof is huge. It is easy transportable if you need to take your documents with you somewhere. This organizer is perfect for my needs!",
