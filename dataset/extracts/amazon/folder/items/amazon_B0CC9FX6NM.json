                "reviewText": "I grabbed these in bulk for two reasons, one because my 10 year old is insanely rough on his folders and rips at least a few every month. And the other reason is both my sister and brother in law are teachers, which if you don\u2019t know most get paid nowhere near what they should and they also get next to nothing in terms of stipends to buy stuff they need for there children and classroom. Let me put it this way, by brother in law makes $60,000 a year and gets. $75 stipend of his classroom and students, and my sister makes $40,000 a year and gets a $50 stipend for stuff for the class room and students\u2026 yeah. So I figured I would keep a good handful of these and pass the others to one or both of them.As far as quality goes, they are exactly the same ones you can get in store for like 15-20 cents a piece in store. Nothing more and nothing less. You get a bunch of different colors which is nice so that you can use them by class. Overall not bad!",

                "reviewText": "I was not expecting the outstanding quality, but in fact, these matte folders are carefully constructed from heavy duty card stock that is surprisingly water-resistant. In the interest of science, I poured a glass of water over one of the folders. What did not run off immediately sat on the surface without absorption. I had resolved to sacrifice a folder for the water test, but in the end, I wiped off the remaining moisture with a paper towel and stuck it back in the box.As represented, the folders do, indeed, hold 50 sheets on each side. I tested this with 28 pound printer paper, so I expect that standard 20 pound paper might allow a few more sheets.The card stock is crisply folded and well-glued. I bashed the corners of one folder against a wall without doing damage. I then tried to scrape the paper with my fingernails, but that also failed to make a mark.The folders do indeed have slots for business cards, but if you choose to use them for filing instead of presentation, you won't notice the slots are there. If you need to label them, I suggest that adhesive file tabs will work perfectly. Five colors give wide latitude to coding by color, if only I could think of how to organize the categories. But that's my failing, not that of the folders.In an era that is supposed to be paperless, I have a scanner, but somehow I still have stacks of paper all over the house. I bought these folders to contain a potential avalanche of paper before it drags me under, and I think they will perform the task admirably.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the 125 count pocket folders. At only $0.27 a folder, it is a very good deal for anyone looking to stock up their office supplies. One can never have too many folders when it comes to organizing paperwork. These folders have 2 pockets inside and a slit for a business card too! I like how they come in 5 colors. Overall, this is a very good purchase because of it's price point. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "These folders are absolutely wonderful. They are nicely made and stand up to abuse. The fact that they come in a 125 count is a lifesaver for me, I go through a lot of these folders with our senior pet rescue! We can't afford to spend a lot on office supplies so this price point is a definite bonus. The five different colors are all crisp and the folders hold quite a bit. There is a place to put a business card which we also love. If you have a use for this type folder, this is a great buy.",
