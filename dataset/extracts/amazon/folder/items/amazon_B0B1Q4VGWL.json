                "reviewText": "It's definitely durable and gets the job done, but the inner separators are really thin and flimsy. I'm not saying they break or fall apart or anything like that, they're just super thin and bendy. But other than that it's a great way to conveniently organize and carry around loose papers all in one place instead of dealing with individual folders. Overall rating: 4/5 :)",

Has 5 slots to easily organize what I needed to take with me. Held up the whole way. The snap closure is nice and firm. Doesn\u2019t feel like it will wear out any time soon. The folder as a whole also feels like it wont rip/fall apart. It all felt like a nice, quality made product. Small gripe is that the labels are not easy to peel off if I want to change them, but that\u2019s not a big deal at all to me.",
