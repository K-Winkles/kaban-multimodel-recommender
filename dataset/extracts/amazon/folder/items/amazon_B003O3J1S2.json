They hold the papers in keeping them from getting destroyed and the plastic is a thicker quality for the product. They are pricier then the others but really well worth it when they take a beating and still last all year... No other plastic folders to date can top these. The item was as advertised in the description, arrived in the correct time frame and was shipped well and all intact upon delivery. When the price is right, Amazon is my number one \u201cgo to\u201d for almost everything. The Prime membership is (a lifesaver sometimes even) well worth it and the fact you can keep things in the cart until the price drops makes it a huge shopping tool. Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I got these folders as an add-on item for $.99 each. I would never pay anything more than $1 on these folders, however for $1 the quality is great. They are made of a thick paper with a coating. They have lasted through 1 term so far at school and you can see from my photos they look pretty good.I am a college student and think they are perfect to use as folders for class. I use them to bring in homework and store handouts from my teachers. They say there are \"4 pockets\" in the description but there are two bottom pockets and then there is a pocket on each side of the folder that you can use for organization within the bottom two pockets.Overall as long as you pay $1 or less, these folders are great for the price and if you treat them well should last you a full year of school.",

                "reviewText": "Update: The seller, HaleyMAE, for my last order has explained the issue that I have with this product and has been beyond helpful. I'm giving this seller the 5 stars, not Mead/Five Star. My thanks to HaleyMAE.Prior review:This is stupid. I've ordered the same folders (item#72093), I thought, multiple times over the past few years. The item numbers and descriptions matched; and, I ordered the later ones using Amazon's \"order again\" option from my previous orders. The last two were a 1/2 inch longer than the first ones at 12 1/2 inches total. I looked back at all the folders that I ordered and they were all described as being 12 1/2 inches long by the description on Amazon. But the first two were short, and I didn't know it. The short ones were what I wanted. I ordered the later ones thinking they were the same size as the shorter ones. While I admit the later ones were the correct size by the description on Amazon, I only reordered those because I thought they were the size I wanted. The minor problem is the larger ones extend outside the length of a standard size notebook binder so the edges won't be protected and will likely become damaged over time. The major problem is that these folders are for a memorabilia project and I covered them with stickers before I noticed the issue. Now, I have $30 worth of stickers on the wrong size folders because I didn't catch this. Stupid... : (BTW. I send a complaint email to Mead/Five Star and never heard a word back. : (",
