The translucent plastic is not appropriate for business files that would need the security of opaque cardboard. However, they're excellent for home use! They're very durable and the plastic prevents the dog-ears and bending that comes with traditional cardboard-style manila folders. They came with labels that you can write on, but I just used my label maker. I had a little trouble getting the labels to stick, but I'm not sure if that was my labels or the folders. Overall, great for certain applications.",
