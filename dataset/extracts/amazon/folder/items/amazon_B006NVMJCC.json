Using a two hole punch on all of the paperwork prevents things from falling out and it nicely organizes everything by travel segment, etc. Whatever method you choose, these work wonders to keep you organized.After the trip is over we file the whole folder to reference later.Not the cheapest out there - buy well worth the money.",
