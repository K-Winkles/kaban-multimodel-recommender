The folders can hold a number of papers, and keep them inside. I'm happy with these folders and am sure they will work well for my purpose.",

The folders are also not to have any prongs or other superfluous \"accessories\". I was so thrilled to find a set of these folders, 2 in each color, to satisfy the school supply list for 2 kids months ahead of time! Back to school shopping will be much easier this year!These folders are similar to the mid-high quality poly folders at most big box stores. They aren't quite as thick as a Mead poly folder, but very close.",

                "reviewText": "When the product arrived it had the plastic covering damaged as well as a folder torn where the damaged covering was. I was hoping for a little firmer folder than what this is for school documents. The prongs work and the pockets work well though. I would buy it again for my kids school supply but not for important documents.",
