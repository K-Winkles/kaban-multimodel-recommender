                "reviewText": "I'm currently using these for various campaigns in a pen/paper game I play. With the label system I can keep track of the various \"worlds\" and not have to worry about scattered papers here and there getting intermixed.I do like the front insert that comes with the folders, or you can put your own 8.5x11\" paper in there to mark each folder.I also like that the top of the folders has a flap that you can move up/down to help tuck the papers into the folder.Additionally, I also liked the \"pouches\" inside as they stand off from the folder itself to allow you to put your papers in there without them being squished.The only thing that gives me a little pause is that they're not \"stiff\" like some of the older cardboard type folders we use to roll with back in the day. However, as they are plastic this also means it won't ruin them if someone spills their drink on them. And if you have papers inside the folders that helps to shore up the folder itself. Just bear in mind that there aren't 3 ring holes punched in the folder so you can't put it into a 3-ring binder unless you want to do some punch work yourself.The price is good too, and you'll get five different folders, so I'd recommend picking these up if you need a folder.",
