They are standard size and can be expanded by the folding indents like regular manila folders. I do have two complaints, though: First, the tab labels don't stick. I put them on and they start sliding around the tab until they fall off. Second, one of the tabs tore quite easily. I'm not even sure how it happened, but they've just been sitting here in my file drawer and somehow one got torn. So, they may not be suitable for heavy duty filing, but I do love them for organizing my documents at work.",
