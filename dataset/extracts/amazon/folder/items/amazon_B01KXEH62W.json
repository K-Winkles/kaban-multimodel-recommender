It is helpful to organize and I like that it has a closure on the side to hold your papers from falling out.Unfortunately, the little clasp to close the folder already broke. I wasn't expecting too much for the price. It is sturdy and I know I'll be able to use this for a while. The clasp fell apart so I'm thinking I may try to glue it together and see how it works.The folder is just a tad too wide. It will hold your standard 8.5\" x 11\" but it may not fit as well in a file holder. It is about 3/4\" longer than the paper so it didn't fit well horizontally in mine. I had to place it vertically and it looked awkward since the rest of my folders are horizontal. I ended up just moving where I placed it because I didn't like how it fit or looked.",
