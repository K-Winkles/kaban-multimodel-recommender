                "reviewText": "One half of the case isn\u2019t entirely compatible with the other half of the case. The bottom is substantially larger than the top when it is fully open. I had something like this back in the 80s and the top and bottom would both accordion to the same size. With this one the bottom expands and the top doesn\u2019t. You can either have full size, or you can have a top cover, but you can\u2019t have both. Who thought that was a good idea?This isn\u2019t well-suited for letter size paper. It can squeeze in there, but it can\u2019t lay flat. The edges are forced to curl in a little because this is just a smidge too narrow. I get the feeling it was meant for A4 paper, which it looks like it will suit just fine, and then someone found out that these sell better in the US if you put \u201cletter\u201d in the description. They didn\u2019t bother to find out what that meant, or if they did, they didn\u2019t bother to test and just put the word there.I\u2019m using this for a short-term project, and I plan to try to make do, but I don\u2019t like it and if this goes to long term I\u2019m replacing it.",
