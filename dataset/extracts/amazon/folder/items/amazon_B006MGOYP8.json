I use a leather crossbody messenger bag that I decided to convert into a filing system---I am a university instructor and I carry all my tests and activities with me. I use post-it tabs to separate my papers and everything is organized beautifully. I love that I can just pull out the folder and put it back into its place inside of the bag without messing up my 'system.' The different colors help me to keep my classes separate as well by color coding them. If I were working on research, these would also be an ideal way to organize my notes and printed journals. They are also very resilient to everyday use. Before I bought these folders, I was using plastic pocket folders with brads. They could not withstand all of the papers that I needed to keep together and began to separate. These folders can handle a LOT of papers--they expand past an inch and have not began to separate at all. I would gladly buy these again and will as needed.",

                "reviewText": "These files came in a packet of assorted colors, which makes it easy to put materials for different projects in color-coded file. I attend meetings away from the office, so it makes it easy to keep the relevant papers in this expandable, plastic envelope. It can accommodate a notebook and 8 1/2 x 11 sheets of paper. I recommend these expandable files. I like that the ends are closed, so papers don't fall out.",
