It looks like it could hold many folders, but my needs only require a few at a time I recommend this bag for not only looking more professional, but it keeps paperwork, wrinkle free and organized, I ordered the gray and it\u2019s perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because I have documents in small piles all over the place. When I want or need some document, I can't find it.Pros:Now everything can be centrally located.2) The case is very attractive (very nice color).3) Made of good quality materials.Cons:1) The carry handles are made of cloth webbing. Not the most comfortable in the hand. The edge of the webbing is perpendicular to the flesh of the palm.2) Over time, the webbing will get dirty from being handled (unless they are treated with some kind of Scotchguard, idk). A suggestion would be flat plastic handles that can be tucked away into the two side pockets for storage, or pulled up for use as needed.3) The interior pocket dividers are open at the bottom. This means smaller envelopes and receipts are going to sink to the bottom and get stuck down there between and underneath dividers. This needs some kind of webbed material frame to hold the dividers in place and create a pocket bottom between each set of dividers walls.",

I have had 3 different plastic organizers before this and each one tore under the stress of my papers. This organizer is now holding all of my papers and still has room for more. It is sturdier than anything I have used before. It is attractive and has very nice outside pockets and the zippers are strong. This organizer is just what I needed!",

Finally found what needed, but I swore I would get organized this year. So I got into my Amazon account, (my husband calls me a heavy user!) and there it was. The prefect solution. Right price, well made and I know where all the important paperwork is \u2014in one spot. Side note: we\u2019ve had to evacuate our home several times over the years due to fires, and this gives me piece of mind that all documents are ready to go if needed.",
