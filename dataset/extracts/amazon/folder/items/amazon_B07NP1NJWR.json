                "reviewText": "Purchased to upgrade my frequently used file folders at my desk at work to something more durable. These are nice, like the colors. they work well I just was hoping for something a little more sturdy when sitting vertical in a step up file holder, these work but tend to druop after a bit. Note that not both sides are open one is sealed shut which is not a huge big deal, but if you have thick files to place it may make it a bit difficult to hold everything. The are also translucent in color so you can see anything you have in them so if your looking for folders that you want to put confidential info and keep on a desk or something these would not be a good fit, you would have to put another paper in to cover up what you dont want visiable. The other downfall is the tab is really small compared to regular file folders so if you like to print your labels to put on them you have to have a smaller label the regular sized file folder labels are too big. but the labels stick nice and dont appear to be falling off so thats a plus. I think they are nice & I like them just some small issue I had to work around in order to use as I had envisioned.",

                "reviewText": "I have only had this product a few days. While using it for the first time, I found that I had received an extra blue file and was short one yellow file. I called customer service with this minor inconvenience and was greeted with respect and genuine appreciation for the issue. Rather than have me return the product and wait for a replacement to arrive, they simply sent out an entire package. It was actually more cost effective for them to do that. I should note that the second package I received with my original order had the correct number of files and colors. Ditto for the replacement package - all files/colors present and accounted for. This is truly outstanding customer service!I noticed another reviewer said these files are too wide for the Pendaflex system. This is not correct. They fit easily into my existing Pendaflex file system. The files are well made and appear to be able to stand up to robust use. I would happily recommend them.",
