I like that the labels are for dry erase markers, and therefore you can change the label over and over as needed. Unfortunately, they don't fit in the wall pockets I keep these papers in, so I need a different system for holding these durable accordion files if I want to keep them on the wall.

The snap let you keep the folder closed so nothing falls out. And the plastic will provide some limited protection in case the folder gets wet somehow. There are 5 tabbed slots in the folder, so you can set a category for each slot. And I was able to write 2024 on the outside without the magic marker ink smudging. It also comes with 8 labels you can use for the 5 tabs (3 extras, or are the extra 3 for the back side of 3 tabs?). My only complaint is that I wish there were a couple more slots/tabs, so I could separate my tax docs/receipts even more uniquely.",

The pockets are able to hold a good amount and I love the included tabs for labeling. I do wish it came with 3-4 extra label stickers, because if you mess up, then you don\u2019t have any extras to use. But other than that, I\u2019m happy with these and would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "As I move through organizing my paperwork, and aspire towards completing the one box challenge (where all legacy/important documents are stored together in a fireproof box or safe) I am finding these expanding folders to be very useful. One of them is going to corral educational records, the other is going to be the home of various home improvement documents and I'm planning to order another set to corral various insurance documents.Not only can you label the tabs, but you can also just stick regular file folders into the different sections, which is what I'm doing right now. Absolutely worth it in my ongoing paperwork organizational process.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my teen daughter. She is starting school again doing her taxes for the first time and needs to be organized. Nice material and many slots. Good size for different sized files. Tabbed so you can organize per subject. Nice coloring and can wipe down if needed. The only thing is I never got the sticker tabs included to write per subject on the lipped tabs. It\u2019s okay as I have other options but it wasn\u2019t inside the folders or included anywhere. Overall my daughter likes it and it\u2019s easy to travel with as it has a nice snap closure on the top to confirm the pages won\u2019t fall out if they are large enough sheets.",
