                "reviewText": "I got this folder because I have a lot of papers I have to carry between locations and I was hoping for something that would be thin but also allow me to divide and organize my papers. So I found this and thought that this is exactly what I need. And it kinda is. It's fairly well built and I like that it has four pockets. One major major issue is though that the side that has three pockets does not give you any more room to put papers than your standard size. Which is a problem when you have a lot of papers you want to put in each. I figured the accordion part of the folder was that side but it is actually the other side. Which only has one pocket. And so you have room to stick a whole bunch of paper in one pocket that is then unorganized. Which defeats the purpose of this folder. I don't get it but I guess that's just me. The grey closing tab is a little funky and I generally don't use it.Overall it's ok. I wish the accordion part of the folder was the one with all the dividing pockets in it but it's still usable.",
