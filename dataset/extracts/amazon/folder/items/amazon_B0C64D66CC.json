                "reviewText": "I had not an issue with any of the sheerness and durability of these clear pockets. They are kind of like envelopes, without the flap. I use them to store my cutting dies in. Since they are both wider and taller than the magnetic sheets I had also ordered through Amazon, it works out perfectly for my storage bin system. I have bins and now sheer pockets to store by season/holiday and even everyday dies and stamps. This has worked out a lot better than using binders where I can't see and then having to open envelopes all the time. The dies stay in place on the magnetic sheets - both sides and adhering the magnetic sheets to the cardstock helps create a nice magnetic two - sided sheet that fits well in these pockets. I haven't had an issue with the pockets coming apart and they didn't arrive that way either. All have well welded seams. As for sturdiness, they are sheer envelopes and are not stiff. Soft plastic of some sort. I only just started using them and I may have to change or add to the review later. To see if they are still holding up. For now they are doing a great job. However, if you are wanting something more stiff - these pockets are not stiff.",

                "reviewText": "I have ADHD and I process a lot of things better on paper than a screen, so I print a lot of things out for work: emails, project briefs, screenshots, the actual work, and supporting materials. But I work on a lot of projects simultaneously, for multiple clients, and I have to drag my big ol\u2019 stack of paper back and forth because I work hybrid. So these have been amazing to use. I can color code per client, which makes it easy to navigate my giant stack.I bought two packs at first and just bought to more. They\u2019re amazing and take the abuse I put them through well.",
