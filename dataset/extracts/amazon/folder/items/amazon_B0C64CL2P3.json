Being able to reuse them indefinitely makes these an excellent value compared to how many paper folders I would use and these are reasonably priced in a world of higher priced reusable office supplies. I'm not a person who cares about looks if something is functional but I did deliver some papers to a peer who was really excited (!!) about the folder and wanted to keep it. These folders also have various notches on the inside where you can tuck papers in to keep them from falling out. I will order these again if needed.",

Great for color coding your classwork or sorting based on content. For roughly a dollar each folder, these are great to have on hand!",

It would be ok for an adult that could be cognizant of how careful they were being, but not great for my young ones going to school. On the bright side, I have some cute new folders to use in my home office!",
