They\u2019re made from thick paper with bit of a smooth coating that makes it easy to wipe clean. I especially love the various jewel-tone/retro colors. They add a great pop of color to my desk and file drawers.Mr Pen has become one of my favorite companies for office supplies. Their prices are very reasonable without sacrificing quality.

The colors look really nice and they aren't super bright like many other folders can be.The one thing I can think of that would be a pro for some people and a con for others is that the inside of the folder is white. That means you have to be aware of which direction the tab faces to be able to see the color of the folder. This isn't an issue for me since I am mostly using them in vertical orientation where the tab won't be the focus on the organization system (but rather the color of the folder will be for me). I know this could be a bit of an annoyance when figuring out how to best label the folders, but otherwise doesn't bother me",

I got them so I can color code my filing cabinet according to the different subjects. The pricing is not terrible, you get 18 folders for $6.99 which comes out to about $.39 each. My only complaints are (1) that the inside of the folder is white. I suppose they did this so that the tab you write on wouldn't be colored and hence make the writing hard to see. The result however is that you lose a little of the benefit of the color coding once they are tucked into the file cabinet. In a perfect world, the inside of the folder would be the same color and the company would supply write on labels for the tab. (2) That although the folders are 1/3 cut, they are oriented by color, not within color, so if you want to organize subject by color, all the tabs will have the same orientation. These drawbacks are why I only gave the folders 3 stars.",

The material is much heavier than run-of-the-mill Manila folders, and this promises to make this item much more durable than the standard kind. If you're looking for something that will hold up when constantly removed from and replaced in a file drawer, this seems to be a great choice.The colors are bright and unmistakable. They'll be very useful for transferring information in a memorable way: \"The deed is in the teal folder I gave you last week.\"",
