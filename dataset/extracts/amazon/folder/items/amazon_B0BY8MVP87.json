                "reviewText": "I originally ordered this for organizing manuals. It didn\u2019t work for that purpose as well as I had hoped. However, I also have a preschooler and we attend a co-op. This folder has been perfect for organizing and separating worksheets for his class. The plastic is sturdy enough to prevent the papers from getting crunched in the book bag. The tabs are handy. The clear pocket in the front did pull away from the cover, but so far hot glue had held it in place. Over all, for the right application, this is a good product.",

                "reviewText": "I had one folder that was just getting too crowded with many random papers and this helped to organize my life. I love all the multicolor tabs and the ability to color code and label everything. I'm especially thankful for the clear pockets in front of each tab-- great for receipts or smaller things that could get lost. It's pretty durable material and easy to wipe clean as well.",
