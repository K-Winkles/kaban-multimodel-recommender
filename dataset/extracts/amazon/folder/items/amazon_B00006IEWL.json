All customers have a red file folder (with the lighter inside color of these making it easy to write ID# and name with an ultra-fine-point Sharpie, and not need labels). Red scratchpads are dedicated to notes associated with projects, red Post-Its are used to identify associated items... and all client \"stuff\" goes into labeled red plastic bins.In our small messy lab, this really simplifies things. If it is red, it is associated with a client.I know color-coding is obvious to anyone running an office, but these folders work beautifully and are musch less hassle than hanging files that need tags. The two-tone color scheme really helps (we are on our third box of 100).",
