They are designed to go inside a binder but work fine on their own, too. The pastel colors are very nice and ideal for students who like to color code. They are made of a kind of plastic or vinyl, so they\u2019re a bit floppy.",

For my purpose, they work well to keep small group work organized, they hold up to 20 copies easily. I also use these to house student work I have collected for individual students, this really helps to keep me organized, especially for documentation purposes. I would recommend these to other teachers, and know they will continue to be used for years to come in my personal classroom.",

The colors are pretty pastel ones and match the pictures exactly. They're not the glossy (read \"fingerprint magnet\") variety either, which is an added bonus. These are a good pick",
