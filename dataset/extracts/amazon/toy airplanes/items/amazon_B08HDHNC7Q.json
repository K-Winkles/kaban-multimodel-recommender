                "reviewText": "Its a solid toy for the price, but mine didn't feel like it was made 100% correctly. One of the winds seems angled slightly different than the other and it impacts the flight a bit. You can bend it a bit yourself back in pace, but again since its soft foam you're always going to be fighting this a little bit. We still have fun with it and it does fly, but it I can't get it anywhere near 100ft. I'm sure its's possible if the wings are bent just right and you have some skill. Just don't expect to take it out of the box and zip it 100ft with ease.Pros: Economical price point, foam does seem durable in terms of preventing major damage, but it does bend easily, colors schemes are cool and kid friendly, it does fly and won't damage anything it knocks into (indoor friendly for the most past).Cons: It flys, but 100ft seems impossible as advertised, hard to control the tricks per the instructions, soft foam means the aerodynamics can be thrown off a bit which affects the flight.",

Couldn't've get it to go 10 feet and right into the ground. Noticed that the wing where it meets the body was made different from the other side. Assume this is the issue. Hopefully they send another one before the long weekend is over!! And it works as advertised!!",
