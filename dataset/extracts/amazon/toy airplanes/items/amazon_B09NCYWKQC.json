The reviews weren't great, but my Grandson specifically asked for a blue airplane. I ordered another type, but returned it because it was too small. When I received this airplane I was amazed at how great it was. It's not at all as big as pictured, but it was a good size and so easy to put together as it only had a few things to snap in. My Grandson loved it and it was only $32 from this seller. The cars were better quality than I expected and my Grandson loved the playmat!! Overall great toy!",
