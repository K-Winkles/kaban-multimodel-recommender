        "description": "RAF Boeing Chinook HC.4 ZH777 No. 28 Squadron Centenary scheme April 2016 172 Scale Airplane Model Toys The unrivalled versatility and load carrying capabilities of the Boeing Chinook helicopter has ensured that this mighty twin rotor heavy lift machine is now one of the most famous aircraft to see post war Royal Air Force service. Equally at home on the battlefields of the Middle East as it is dropping ballast sacks to prevent a dam burst a little closer to home, the Chinook has now been in RAF service since 1980, with the latest variant of this magnificent machine enhancing its already legendary operational flexibility still further. As well as being one of the most important aircraft currently in service, the Chinook is a consummate Airshow performer and a real crowd favourite wherever it performs, with the RAFs Chinook Display Team having the privilege of demonstrating the aircrafts power and manoeuvrability to tens of thousands of people every summer. Retaining their fully operational status at all times, the team must balance normal training requirements with practicing for their dynamic display routine and even though a Chinook is scheduled to take part in an Airshow near you, it could be called away on deployment at a moments notice. If it does display, there is nothing quite like the experience of seeing this huge helicopter being hurled around the sky, with a Chinooks iconic blade slap being a definite Airshow highlight. During the summer of 2016, no less than three of the RAFs Chinook helicopters received attractive special centenary schemes, to commemorate the individual anniversaries of their parent squadrons. The first of the three aircraft to emerge from the paint shop was No.18B Squadrons ZA712 in April 2015, resplendent in its handsome red and black scheme, which included a large poppy on its front rotor housing. Originally formed at RAF Northolt in 1915, the squadron has a rich service heritage, which includes claiming more than 200 enemy aircraft",
