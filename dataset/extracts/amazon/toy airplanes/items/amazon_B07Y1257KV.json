                "reviewText": "We have bought these 2 times over the last couple years. Probably some of the best toddler fun you can buy for $20.The styrofoam is very sturdy for the most part - it can be delicate around the tail area. The back piece can be moved to make the plane fly straight and level or do big loops. The four colors are a bonus level of fun. All of our neighborhood kids like to spend hours outside throwing these (ages 3, 5, 6).For younger ages, parents may have to help move the tail piece to avoid tearing the styrofoam, but we\u2019ve only had one instance of that with the 3 year old over the past year.Pros: sturdy, fun, engaging activity that gets the kids out of the house for hoursCon: might tear the tail (low probability) if your 3 year old decides they want to change the tail piece and doesn\u2019t ask for helpEasy 5/5 for this family. I\u2019ll buy them again when we inevitably lose this set!",

                "reviewText": "Boy, after flying cheap balsa wood gliders, as kids, THESE gliders are great !! Bought these for a family member, who loves aviation. These seem to be pretty durable, as we've flown/crashed them plenty of times, and they hold up well. Be careful when assembling them, as they are still only made out of some sort of rubberized foam. If you grip them wrong, and force them too much during installation, it might be easy to snap a tail piece, etc.. But the average person, using a small amount of CARE, will not have any problem.They fly well. Experiment, as far as WHERE you hold it, while throwing, and the direction you throw. Throwing into a 'slight' breeze, seems to work really nice. We've even played around with taping a small weight (think penny, nickel, or dimes) to certain parts of the gliders, to see if it will help or hurt the flight of the glider. It's been a fun learning tool. I was uncertain how these gliders would HOLD UP, after they crashed a few times. Back as kids, those gliders didn't hold up very long. Well, these new gliders hold up very well (at least from this company, as lots of vendors sell similar ones). We've put in 2 - 3 sessions, of +30 minutes, out in a paved dead-end street. No issues. I was pleasantly surprised. We started out by buying a smaller version of this, and liked it so well, that we upgraded to these larger models (and they include TWO gliders, for the price). Try them, your kids should love them. And if they don't abuse them, they should last for quite a while.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to toss in the back yard with the toddler. I bought a 4-pack thinking they wouldn\u2019t last very long - but I was wrong. These things are not like the foam gliders we bought in the 90\u2019s. They can take a huge beating! I have hit the concrete, furniture, trees, etc and while the nose crumpled a bit - it still flys fine.The thing to note is that I found one plane flew rather poorly - diving to the ground within a few feet while rolling to the right. This was somewhat fixable by warping the wings and tail to correct the flight path.One plane flew particularly well and here is why. Of the 4 planes, the one that flew badly has a weight of 35.5g. The one that flew great has a weight of 27.5g. The nose weight part of the heavy pane weighs 2g more than the nose weight of the light plane - which helps explain its tendency to nosedive.So if you get one that drops down, maybe remove the canopy (carefully, it is attached with what looks like a dab of hot glue) and remove from carefully remove a gram or 2 of foam from the inside - then put it back on. The steel ball weighs 5.5 grams so maybe replacing that with 3.5-4g of something will improve its flight.",
