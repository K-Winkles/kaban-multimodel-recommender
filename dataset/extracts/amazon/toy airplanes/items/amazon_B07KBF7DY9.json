Once you turn it on, it keeps moving around until we turn it off. If it bumps into something, it'll automatically back up and turn into some other direction and keeps moving again.The speakers are a loud and so we put some tape on the speaker holes to cover them up but otherwise it's a fun toy.",

                "reviewText": "The plane itself has good durability. Sometimes the wings might come off because of crashing it into the ground or something, but they can be reattached. It has a cheap audio track but great for young kids. As a parent it does get annoying after a while, ha! It moves on the ground as it has one of those two-wheeled spinning things on the bottom. And a lot of lights!The downside to this toy is the durability of the power switch. I've only owned it for a few months and now the power switch has to be put into a specific slider position and sometimes even pushed on to get the plane to receive power. I will have to get it a replacement, sturdier switch at some point. Otherwise it's a good product.",

Because when my son switches the toy to on, all I see are what visions of what hell must be like! I literally checked my ears to make sure they weren\u2019t bleeding! This toy manufacturer is sadistic! What heartless person creates a toy so loud and on an endless 5 second loop. I mean over and Over and OVER again! I put the broken toy in the box and my son found it\u2026 mind you, it was 7:30 am. I awoke from my sleep screaming, \u201cNOOOO!\u201d My son had a huge smile on his face as if he enjoyed the fact that I was not only scared of the blaring, loud music, but that genuinely torchers my soul! Please\u2026 if you are a parent and you are reading this\u2026 run from purchasing this toy! Run far, run fast! This toy was meant to drive you insane! I don\u2019t want to take a toy away from my son, but I had to be a grown up and say, \u201cNO MORE!\u201d I have decided to put my sanity first! The cool flashing lights and the huge smile on my sons face is not enough to ignore this particular evil. I know that this is a cheap toy but they could have put a switch or button that operates the music. They did not and they know what they are doing! Good riddance to this toy! I don\u2019t care if I get my money back\u2026 it will either be returned or destroyed with a hammer. You have been warned! God Bless!___________________Bought this for my 3yr old son\u2019s birthday. Cool toy, but one of the wings won\u2019t light up. New out of box. This toy is also very loud with no volume control. I mean it\u2019s only $25 bucks so you get what you pay for. I am sending this one back for a new one because my son likes the toy. I am also going to use tape to cover the sound holes so that it\u2019s not so loud!",
