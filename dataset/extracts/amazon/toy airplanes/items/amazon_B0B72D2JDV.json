This single-seater plane features a spinning propeller, two-wheeled landing gear, and racing stripes on its rounded wings. Imaginations will soar to new heights as pilots-in-training practice loops, rolls, and spins with this flyer. The lightweight design and tapered, easy-to-grasp body shape let even the littlest aviators ascend through flight school with ease.",
