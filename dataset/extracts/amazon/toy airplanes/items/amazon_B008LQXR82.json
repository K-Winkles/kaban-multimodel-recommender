Also, they seem to be true to their mission statement with their products. The boxing was all cardboard - no plastic tie downs - and although the toy is made of 100% recycled plastic it feels really good and sturdy. All the parts that are supposed to move do so with ease, and the toy's construction is solid.I am very impressed not just with the toy but also the company behind the toy.",

Very sturdy build, it would take a real hell child to break it.A lot of toys have bells and whistles now and whatnot this doesn't and that's good. Reminds me of 80's and 90's toys I had growing up and let's them use their imagination. Honestly the simple toys are the ones I loved and remembered. Ordered two more toys from Green Toys after receiving this.If your kid loves airplanes the big C-130 made by Tim Mee toys (also Made in USA) was a big hit. I had one growing up and still have my battle tank made by them all these years later. They've made them for decades and my daughter loves it.",

                "reviewText": "My 3 yr old son has recently become fascinated with airplanes so i purchased this, and the green seaplane which is the same body it just has pontoons instead of wheels. He LOVES them. They're larger than i expected but i think that's a good thing, it makes them harder for him to lose. They're made from a thick sturdy plastic, these planes have been thrown into walls, dropped on the floor, even taken in the bathtub (the green one floats), this one does too but not as well. It still looks the same as it did when we took it out of the box, no dents, scratches, fading, etc. I definitely plan to buy more of these!!",
