While my kid was playing, it fell on my toe and it did hurt a bit due to the pointed tip and weight.Size is adult palm size. So depending on kids need, it may be perfect or small.Issues:The dark color near propeller is just tape and it came off within 5 mins of playing. See pic for reference.Wheels aren't if good quality and it doesn't run much for kids liking. Although they can hold the toy and pretend it is flying.",
