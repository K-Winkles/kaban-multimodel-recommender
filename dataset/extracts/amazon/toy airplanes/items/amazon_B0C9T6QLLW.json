Vert Very Very loud and is useless ... It is one of those specific toys.....I was happy it came in a set of two. one was blue and the other was red one.. But the happiness vanished when we heard the sound. Now the kids keeps it turned on and everyone at home is in trouble due to the high pitched volume....If you can bear the high pitched continuous teasing high volume, and can listen to the kid for reassembly after every 1 minute.....go and buy it... there is nothing to bother for you then...It lights up well all around... The front wheels (the landing gear) keeps turning around and makes the plane to move....",
