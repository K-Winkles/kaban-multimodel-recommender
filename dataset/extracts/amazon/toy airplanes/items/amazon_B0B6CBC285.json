It's perfect for toddlers who are fascinated with planes and love pulling things around. The toy's size is just right for little hands to grasp and play with ease.What I love most about these toys is their sensory features. The vibrant colors, different textures, and pleasant sounds create a multi-sensory experience that captivates toddlers' attention. It's great to see how engaged and excited they get while exploring these toys.From a Montessori perspective, these toys are spot-on. They encourage fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and cause-and-effect understanding. Plus, they promote independent play and creativity, which is always a plus for young learners.Overall, I highly recommend The Baby Sensory Toys' Montessori Pull String Airplane Travel Toys for Toddlers 1-3. They are educational, well-crafted, and sure to delight any toddler. It's a win-win for both kids and parents!",
