The Jet Pilot Interactive Dashboard features lights, buttons, switches, and sounds to keep kids engaged and immersed in exciting pretend-play adventures. An airplane steering yoke is mounted on a sturdy wooden cockpit dashboard with a snap-on windscreen that fits three double-sided, full-color destination scenes. A four-position throttle plays engine sounds and adjusts the speed of a scrolling map; turn the yoke to move a mini-plane in the scrolling display! Press and hold a button to record a message, and release to play back with voice change. Turn the destination dial to hear \u201chello\u201d in six different languages (English, Mandarin, French, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic) and press the radio button for music from each destination (U.S., China, France, India, South America, and Africa). Other sound effects include turbo boost, night mode (changes the color of dials, too!), seatbelt, weather options, landing gear, and turning. Light-up dials include altimeter, horizon, heading, and airspeed indicators. Add to the pilot role play experience with the pretend play headset and a reusable takeoff and landing checklist. The dashboard, which has two volume options, requires three AA batteries, not included; the toy automatically turns off after approximately nine minutes of inactivity to prevent battery drain.",

It's a little pricey for what it is, but that's Doug and Melissa for you. As long as it holds up for a while (hopefully till her little sister who is 7 months old get around to using it), I'll be happy. I know our granddaughter is, which makes our daughter happy, which makes my wife and I happy.",

Extremely disappointed!My daughter only enjoyed this toy for about an hour when I realized that the rolling scenery was slowly ripping and curling up. It must have been off-center when it was made, so the longer she played with it, the worse it got. See photos.Otherwise, it was quite possibly the best toy we ever purchased for her. So many fun, realistic sounds! Melissa and Doug are known for their quality toys, and I've been buying their products for my children and my preschool classroom for decades!We returned it to get a replacement, and were so excited to get next-day delivery. But when it arrived today, there was this sound straight out of the box. See video.I am going to give it one more try, because she really does love this toy! I hope I've just had very bad luck. Third time is a charm, right?",

Don\u2019t get me wrong the item is no way worth the \u00a3100 price tag, but as always you are paying the premium due to the official name! It is however very cool and sits on its own base where you can fly the jet as a pilot! Has all different features, sounds and buttons which does a range of different things. Very solid and will last a good amount of time and can also be cleaned easily when required too. Arrived in a fab retail box which could also wrap up lovely as a gift. I would buy this again :)",

The throttle, controlling the scrolling map's speed, and the yoke that moves the plane within the display, add an immersive element to the experience. The variety of impressive sounds, including turbo boost and landing gear, My personal favorite is the weather button that elicits corresponding weather sounds, adding a remarkably immersive dimension to the play. . The destination dial and radio button greeting in 6 languages enhance the interactivity and educational aspect of the toy. However, the replay value may not be as high as anticipated, as children may lose interest after a few play sessions. Moreover, the price point of over 80 pounds does seem a bit steep for the overall engagement it offers.",

                "reviewText": "I, like a few other reviewers experienced the issue of the picture belt that spins to simulate the plane moving coming off the spool. This happened within around 30 minutes of play time.I took it apart to have a look, and the cause is a bit bizarre. The entire picture belt is printed on sticker paper, and the backing is left on. I thought maybe they'd done this because they'd use the end of the sticker to attach both ends of the belt together, but they don't. They use a piece of cello tape. So there is no reason at all for the belt to be printed on sticker paper. The belt breaks the non-sticky backing quickly gets frayed, which causes the picture belt to get stuck to the rollers and the whole thing comes apart.It's a relatively easy fix as long as the picture belt hasn't gotten damaged. 10 Allen screws and carefully removing the belt from the ruined backing paper, then sticking it to something non-sticky. I used an A3 document holder. Wrap it back round the rollers and stick one end to the other with a bit of tape.For the price though I really can't recommend because it seems inevitable that this will happen, unless some of them don't have the belt printed on sticker paper.",
