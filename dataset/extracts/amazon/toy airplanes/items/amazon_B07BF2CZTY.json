I didn't realize when I ordered it that it had the folding landing gear, fold out ladder for the pilot and opening hatch for the pilot so those were all pleasant surprises and made me glad I picked this one over the green toys brand which is also a great brand btw, but their airplanes didn't have all this functionality. My son loves this plane and it seems to be made really well and the colors are very nice. I like that he can play with it inside or outside and I don't have to worry about it getting broken.

He's VERY rough on toys and my husband's planes keep getting taken apart so I wanted something less vintage/special but just as cool. I almost bought the green toys airplane since we love their sturdiness, but I was afraid it might not hold his attention like the planes with more moving parts. I saw this one in the suggestions and I'm so glad I got this one instead!There are 3 movable propellers, wheels can be out up and down, the cockpit can be opened and shut, and there is even a little ladder that folds down from the wing. There is no pilot, and I kinda wish there was, however, my son found other small toys, like hatchimals, (and even candy) to put in the pilots seat, no problem, and for such an inexpensive yet fun and well-built toy, I don't care that it doesn't have a pilot at all.",

We\u2019ve had a Green Toys airplane for a year or so, which is a very sturdy, tough toy, and it\u2019s still looking great and gets played with daily. My son just got this Battat plane today so I can\u2019t speak to it\u2019s longevity, but it seems to be just as sturdy as the Green Toys plane. A bonus is the wheels, steps, and cockpit door that go up & down, I am very happy with this purchase.",
