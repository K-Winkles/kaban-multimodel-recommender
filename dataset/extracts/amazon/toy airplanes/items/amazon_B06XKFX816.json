Like any Fischer Price toy, it is extremely well made. Super sturdy and very colorful. The things the airplane, and the people say, are the cutest things! The pilot even thanks you for flying with them. You hear the brakes screech to a halt, island music plays, etc. I think as he gets another month or two older, he'll even enjoy it more than he does now! Great price on Amazon. Fischer Price toys just last forever too!!",

It comes in a box which I did open to ensure everything was inside, and I was super pleased to find that the batteries were included, just not installed. I installed them, and then put the plane back in the box to wrap as a present. Im not sure how they fit the plane in the first time, but you may consider just waiting until its open before trying to fuss around with it. The songs and phrases are cute, and I can't wait to give it to my 18 month old for Christmas.",
