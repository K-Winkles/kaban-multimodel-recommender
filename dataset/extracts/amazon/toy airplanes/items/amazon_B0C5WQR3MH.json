We never seem to have enough cool toys for boys, so I thought I\u2019d get a bunch of these. I think the kids are going to enjoy them.Out of the set of 20, there are 4 helicopters, 14 planes and a space shuttle. The wheels on all of these move, as do the propellers. There are military and private planes\u2014all of which are screen-printed with very realistic detail. They\u2019re all self-propelled when you pull them back on the wheels.The plastic is #7 and the paint is non-toxic. There are a lot of small parts, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend these for children younger than elementary ages. At about $17 for the set of 20 at the time of this review, you\u2019re paying about 85 cents, each, for these aircraft toys. That would make them fairly economical as prizes or party favors.",

                "reviewText": "The biggest pro of these planes is that all the kids I gave them to thought they were very fun. The package came with a good variety of colors and types of planes. Each plane came individually wrapped in plastic which was easy to open, but did create extra waste. The box I received had 1 biplane, 4 helicopters, 1 rocket and the rest were generic planes of various types. Each piece is 3-4 inches in size. The planes had good detailing, with fun colors; it is all paint, no stickers. They had precise lettering and designs. Some were painted in a very similar manner to a popular animated movie about airplanes, but not all of them. The most fun part is that all the planes have the pull-back feature where you pull back the plane, let it go, and it drives on it\u2019s own. This entertained the kids for quite a while. The propellers all spin, except that several of the planes had very stiff propellers that didn\u2019t spin easily.The biggest con of these planes is that they aren\u2019t very durable. One plane\u2019s pull-back feature broke within five minutes. They are made entirely of light plastic, which isn\u2019t strong and probably won\u2019t last. There are small parts, the wheels and propellers, which could break off, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend these planes for toddlers who put things in their mouths. They would be perfect for party favors, stocking stuffers, or a school treasure box, as long as you don\u2019t expect them to last too long. That being said, it\u2019s been 4 days since I handed them to the kids, and only the one has broken, so they have already lasted as long as I expected, since they cost less than $1/plane. Overall, pretty pleased with this purchase.",
