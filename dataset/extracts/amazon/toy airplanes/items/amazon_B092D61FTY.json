                "reviewText": "So much fun! We have the jet model of these, also. They take a bit for a young kid to figure out the body mechanics that ends in successful flight but once that happens....oh my, they soar! Fun for the kids to change the tail (I'm told it's called a horizontal stabilizer, who knew) to alter the flight. The lights are an added plus, however, if the kids are young and you live in a daylight savings zone....that feature is never fully experienced. Two, not surprising experiences with these; eventually, some of them ended up with the hard plastic (cockpit area) being broken; likely less of an issue when being used by a kid who's more proficient at throwing. Also, important to remind little kids to handle the movable parts with care and proper grasp, otherwise those styrofoam pieces break. For the price and the hours (literally) of fun, in the end, that part is really a non-issue.",
