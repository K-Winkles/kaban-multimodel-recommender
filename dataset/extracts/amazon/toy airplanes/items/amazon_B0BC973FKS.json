I had to do some adjusting to get the planes to fly more them 5 or so feet without diving to the ground. (even after following the directions). One we had to put the wings upside down for it to work. Overall, cute, fun toy for the little ones. With a tad of knowldedge of how planes work they are fun to play with. However, since they were a tad of an issue for my son (8) to figure out alone without almost breaking while trying to \"bend\" the back as the instructions suggest. I have to drop a star.",

He likes to use the gun to launch them but the younger kids love to self propel them. They have lots of fun indoors and outdoors. The planes are very light yet very sturdy. These planes have been through it since Christmas Day and they are still intact and working fine. I was debating on purchasing another set but the way these kids are gravitating towards these, I\u2019m going to have to purchase two more. We love these so much!!",

They eventually got broken, but mostly because too small of children got a-hold of them and, since it's winter, they were using them inside mostly, leading to their early demise. Definitely more of an outside toy. Overall we got our money's worth though. May purchase again keeping the above in mind.",

It\u2019s such a great outdoor activity to keep toddlers entertained. I got it for our two year old who got the hang of it pretty quickly. Once we get the plane on the gun he knows how to shoot it. Highly recommend this as a gift especially for those who live on land! We live in the country and it\u2019s so cool to see how far these planes go! You can also throw the planes without the gun and they go a decent distance but not as far as when using the gun. Highly recommend!!",
