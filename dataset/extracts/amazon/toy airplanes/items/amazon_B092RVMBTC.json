When I found this, I knew it was just what he wants.It had some assembly but was easy and felt solid. The doors open well and the vehicles can go in. The wheels make it go easily. I am so pleased!After the children started to play with this I came to realize that it is not as well made as I thought. While parts (like the tail fin) are easy to snap into place they just as easily snap out. Also the ramp to load and unload vehicles has a flaw. It is two parts and needs to be folded up to close the door. That part comes off easily and yet is not easy to put back. It can be frustrating for the kids.",
