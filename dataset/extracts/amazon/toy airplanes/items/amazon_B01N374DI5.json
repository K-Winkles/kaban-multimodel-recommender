                "reviewText": "This is the best, I repeat, the BEST thing ever! My 3 year old nephew is enamored with tools, and more importantly drills. I do have to say that there is no real off switch to the drill so all day we heard the drill spinning because my nephew refused to put it down or even just hold it without his fingers on the trigger. Silver lining, we always knew where he was because we just follow the sound of the drill! (At a certain point, through sneaky maneuvers, we were able to remove the batteries from the drill at night so that the drill would be \"sleeping\" and then secretly put them back in when the drill \"woke up\" in the morning -- worked for naptime too).The drill has reverse and forward action so that this airplane could be taken apart and put back together endlessly. There are three bits to the drill, which is awesome for choices. The flat head and Phillips head can be used interchangeably for all the screws. Then there is a bolt bit for taking apart the big wheels. It's an awesome learning toy because my nephew was able to figure out that the wheels required one bit and the screws another. Also with the drill he caught on that turning one way tightened the screws to put it together and if he wanted to take it apart he just flipped the switch on the drill. (I had been worried that it may be a little over his head for a three year old, but I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong). The plane is durable plastic so it is a fun toy to play around with and spin the propeller, but by far, most of the enjoyment comes from putting it together and taking it apart (and of course, the drill itself).I had also tried the drill to see if it worked on his other tool set screws from a different brand and it did! So the drill is not only limited to building and taking apart this airplane. I feel that's a great added bonus.My only critique is that the back tires are secured together with one screw so rolling the plane around (because all the wheels turn so it rolls too) ultimately ends up unscrewing the 2 small back wheels and they just keep rolling off when the plane is rolled around on the floor. But the big front wheels stay on so it doesn't hinder the plane from still rolling around. Just keep an eye on the little wheels so that when they roll off they and the screw that secures them don't get lost. (They're not a small size but still, they roll and can end up under couches, book shelves, entertainment centers, etc.)All in all, this is the best toy I have seen in a very long time - offering education and fun! I would love it if this brand came out with more types of vehicles to build and deconstruct, i.e. buses, cars, rockets, motorcycles, etc. Or even different structures. Love this product!",

                "reviewText": "My 4 1/2 year old grandson really enjoyed this. He struggled some with assembly which is probably a good thing. After trying over a few days he could get it assembled or partially assembled most of the time. He sometimes left the wings off, but who needs wings to fly? ;-)I would give it 5 stars but the power screwdriver didn't work correctly. It acted as if the trigger was always pulled. No problem, the screwdrivers could be used manually and I opened up the screwdriver and bent the metal contacts so the trigger works properly now. I'll send it to my grandson and let him try it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my 2, almost 3, years old boy. He loves tools, real ones. He also loves to take things apart. Last year, he received the Melissa & Doug tool set and he lost interest really fast. Probably because he knew they weren't real? I researched a lot of toys for 2 year olds and they all looked very simple for my kid's taste. I took a chance and ordered this plane even when it stated that it is recommended for 3+ years. It was the best decision I could've made, he loves it.The drill is very sturdy and works great. It uses 2 AA batteries that are not included. The noise it makes is very tolerable, won't drive you crazy. My boy is kind of rough with it and it has hold up to now.There are lots of parts but they aren't that small that you night lose them easily. If your child doesn't put things in their mouth, you are good.Once put together, it was bigger than I expected, which is great. He plays with it and pretends to fly around. The wheels and the propeller work and overall it is a very sturdy toy that will last a long time. The colors are beautiful and it is of great quality.He doesn't know how to assemble it by himself but with a little help, he can do most of the assembly.If the bolts are too tight, you can loose them with your fingers. All the screws work but for him is a thrill to change them and being able to decide which will do the work.I highly recommend this for kids that show interest for taking apart things who also love real working tools. Excellent value!",

Das erste Mal brauchte er noch Hilfe, um zu zeigen was nach oben oder unten geh\u00f6rt, aber jetzt kann er es ganz alleine. Vor allem der Akkuschrauber ist der Hit.Mit dem Akkuschrauber werden die Schrauben nur sehr leicht eingedreht und mal sollte sie auf keinen Fall mit den H\u00e4nden nachdrehen, denn sonst kriegt das Kind sie mit dem Akkuschrauber nicht mehr heraus.Das Flugzeug ist sehr robust und es ist sch\u00f6n, nach dem Aufbauen ein richtig gro\u00dfes Spielzeug zu haben, das den Propeller und die R\u00e4der bewegt. Bewegliche Teile (vor allem dir R\u00e4der) sind meinem Sohn sehr wichtig ;)War ein tolles Geschenk!",
