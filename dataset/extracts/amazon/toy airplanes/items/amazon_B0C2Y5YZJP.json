They are a bit flimsy, and I did accidentally bend some of the pieces when trying to insert the wings into the larger plane body. Without the clear hard plastic nose piece, the planes won\u2019t glide at all, but once I put that in place the plane flew through my family room and my kiddo just loved it! I think these are great for a treasure box or for trick-or-treat (2 planes come in each pack). For the low price of $.17 cents per plane, I think these are fun despite the flimsy quality.",
