                "reviewText": "I ordered these planes for my son a several weeks ago. He loves them, but the only negative flaw with the planes are the stickers came off. Only after a few days of use, the stickers which includes the name and windows, peel off. They really should be painted on or a stronger adhesive should have been used at the manufacture! I did, however, call the manufacturer to complain and request a duplicate set of stickers be mailed to me, but they were of no help. Told me to go back to Amazon. Talk about passing the buck!",
