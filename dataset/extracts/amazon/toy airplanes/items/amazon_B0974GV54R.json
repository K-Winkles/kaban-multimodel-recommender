He was really excited to get this, even. though it came with cars he do not play with the cars only the planes. Any kid that like plans will enjoy this toy. This plane is like his security blanket wherever he goes (outside, take a bath, and to sleep lol)this plane is by his side.",

It opens at the back end and also on the top, so it allowed him to put matchbox cars in it and pretend they were being shipped on his airplane. Would recommend and purchase again. Very giftable!",
