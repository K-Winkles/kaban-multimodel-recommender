Our 3 year old son is OBSESSED with airplanes so we own more toy airplanes than anyone would consider normal. This little c-17 is so cute. It has a cool cargo compartment, lights, sounds and the overall quality is excellent. I was a little worried that this wouldn\u2019t meet our expectations due to the lack of reviews but the quality is excellent, made a great stocking stuffer, and a high five for military planes. If only we can see a tanker next :)",
