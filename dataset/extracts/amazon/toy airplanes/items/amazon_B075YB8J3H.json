And with the great customer service you will be happy.This item came cracked and missing parts, but actually still worked and was very fun and cute for my toddler. More pieces kept breaking as he played with it the first day we got it. Such a shame because it is a fun toy, but terrible quality.",

Sadly you can\u2019t have the lights without the music\u2026 or so I thought. One small screw driver, a pair of wire cutters, and 10 minutes of you time will give you the reward of a silent plane that still has the flashing lights. Take off the top, find the two green wires, give them a snip, put the top back on and BOOM no more sound. You could take the out batteries but where\u2019s the fun in that? The lights are pretty cool and not as insanity inducing.",
