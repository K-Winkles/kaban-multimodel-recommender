                "reviewText": "These are hand-me-down generational quality toys! These Green Toys are absolutely the best, hands down! What's not to love? The minute you recieve one you realize the substantial and durable quality of them. They are easy to clean and I literally can not fathom any saftey hazards whatsoever with these toys (other than if the are used as a projectile, but that is the case with most toys that are not fabric, so obviously if there is a baby in the bunch with some older toddlers or so, you should still have your eyes on the kids). I love that they are all dishwasher safe for sterilizing. We have decided to keep all the Green Toys in a toy box in our main livingroom for 2 reasons. When we have company with children or playmates visiting, they can all just dive into these toys and we don't have the aggravation of my grandson's other toys being dragged out with multiple pieces, and those are not all small child safe, and we can not just throw them in the dishwasher afterwards as we can these. These are literally worry free toys when children are visiting (other than the aforementioned throwing, or maybe banging over the head, so yes you still must parent as we should be anyway). Second, after dinner, when there is just a small window of time for bath and playtime before bed, these are hassle free and the only toys we let him drag out because they are simple and easy pickup. BONUS, they are MADE IN THE USA, and of completely recycled materials. I have not seen that many quality toys like these other than ones made in the 1940's or so, where good craftsmanship (as these are) mattered, even in a toy. We have at least 2 dozen of these toys and they have become an awesome gift item especially when they go on sale, which is often. They are literally the PERFECT toys!",

I was getting tired of throwing out moldy squirt toys and this was just what I was looking for. The design is so simple, but still lots of fun. I love that the propellers actually turn when you move it over the water. We have a submarine toy from this company as well and it is equally great. I hang them upside down in a mesh bag after each bath and they dry out quickly and do not get moldy! The quality is great too, I can see these lasting for a very long time.

Boys of this age are the ultimate in testing the destructibility of toys. He enjoys playing with the plane in and out of the water. It's been given the bam-bam test repeatedly and so far, it's holding up well. It's easy to clean and there hasn't been any slimy mold growth. Hope to use it in the pool this summer.",

It's a solid toy other than the back hatch, which she somehow managed to get undone at the hinge and the release tab jammed inside\u2014not once, but twice. We had a hard time fixing it both times.

                "reviewText": "It was exactly what I was hoping for as a gift to my almost 2year old son. I made a strong effort to only buy Christmas gifts made in the United States this past year. Tough finding age appropriate toys made in US for his. This toy nailed it. I really like the simplicity of the box as well.I went ahead and bought him the car carrier that Green Toys makes for his birthday (next week). I will continue to buy these.",
