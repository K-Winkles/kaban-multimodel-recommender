At this moment they only know about the plane; they don\u2019t know about any of the accessories that came with it. So here\u2019s a tip if you have a child who is 2 buy this; it\u2019s only 3 and up cause of the small parts and you can introduce those part to them later on when they\u2019re older. Like all the accessories that came with this is unopened and probably be months before they get opened.Also I don\u2019t have any pics or videos I try not to be on my phone when visiting.",
