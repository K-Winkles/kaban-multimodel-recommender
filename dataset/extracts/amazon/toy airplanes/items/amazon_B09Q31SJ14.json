No batteries needed, no noise, these are well-made and very easy to use, just push and they roll surprisingly fast across the floor (hardwood or linoleum is best). They do light up and are replicas of real planes. Arrive in an attractive box. The planes are smaller than you might imagine, butjust the right size for little hands. Don't hesitate to get on the floor and play with your child, you'll enjoy it.",

Now, I don't expect them to last forever, but when our son opened them, I was truly impressed. It's hard to find toys that are not plastic these days. They lasted a month for our 6 year old before they started breaking - and he's not that hard on toys and they were played with 90% downstairs where there is carpet, as in, they were not being dropped on hard surfaces. Actually really disappointed because they were his favorite gift. But $40 for them to last a month. Bummed!*updated* customer service reached out and were so kind and offered to send him a new set which arrived today! I have an ecstatic 6 year old, hoping for a better experience and grateful the company wanted to make our situation right! Four stars until they've been played with, but great customer service goes a long way in my book!",
