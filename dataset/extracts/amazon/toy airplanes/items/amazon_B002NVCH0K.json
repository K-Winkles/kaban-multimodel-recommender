The low cost takes the pain out of the occasional broken plastic bit. When we're able to swing a plane trip somewhere, we try to pick one of these up to match the plane type an airline from our adventure as a memento. The UPS plane, however has a special place in our son's heart. Not sure why - he's simply UPS obsessed. Since we live in Seattle, we occasionally go sit at the end of Boeing Field in the afternoon and watch the UPS cargo planes land 10 feet over our head... usually with this toy in hand. Good times.PS would love to see Daron offer the UPS livery on a B757 or B767 since those types constitutes the majority of the UPS fleet.",
