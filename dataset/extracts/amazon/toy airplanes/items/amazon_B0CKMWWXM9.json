The motors are good enough that on a hard floor they\u2019ll go forward, do a ground loop, and then continue in another direction! Surprisingly fun. The wings are plastic, the bodies are metal, and the propellers which are free spinning are plastic. There are no sharp edges and there are three planes. This is for a grandson who is airplane crazy and I\u2019m sure will be a hit with him. Just be aware they give you the dimensions in the ad, but they also show them much larger than they really are.",
