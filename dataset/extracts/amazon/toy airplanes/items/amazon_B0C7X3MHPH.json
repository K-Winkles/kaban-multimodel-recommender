Some trial and error are needed to properly connect these, but please do not force these in, as the plastic connecting clip (latch) may break. Only the body and the main wings are LED-lit. The engines do not. Not a bad deal for the price. The noise level is high and has no volume control.",

This one is a bit difficult to rate...basically, I'm not a huge fan of this toy, but at the time of this review, it only costs about $10, which honesty, feels worth the price despite the faults. So, my review...What I like:\u2022 As mentioned earlier, price is great, and it's very competitive with other toys of this size and functionality.\u2022 The bump-and-go action is fun for my toddler (sort of like a Roomba).What I dislike:\u2022 This toy is super loud, and there is no volume control, so you're stuck with a cacophony of pain. The product states \"realistic sounds,\" but it sounds more like a warzone.\u2022 This takes three AA batteries. Three of them. This is a fairly small toy, and I'm not sure how long my batteries will last (luckily, I am using rechargeable ones), but they are not included either.So again, by far, not a perfect toy, but you can't beat the price. Probably more accurate to say 3.5 stars though.",
