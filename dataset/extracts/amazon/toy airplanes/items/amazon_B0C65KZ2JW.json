                "reviewText": "The launchers that come with these are why I chose it. I thought my kids would like these gliders and having a powered launch and I chose this because it uses a spring launch and not an elastic that can spring back at them. Still some chance of launching it into another kids face with enough force to hurt their eye so adult supervision is recommended for younger kids.Also keep in mind the launcher needs to be loaded before the kids try to push the plane down onto it. My 8 and 10 yr olds did fine with that the 6 year old struggled a little and at one point got a plane stuck on a launcher by shoving the plane all the way down first. Once I got it free we were careful to avoid that and the fun continued. Just be sure to use the pump action to \"load\" the launcher before putting as plan on it and it will work great.I expect the launchers may break first as they are fairly light plastic construction though so long as nobody steps on them or does any similar sort of abuse of them they seem like they will hold up well.Each of the planes worked really well with some variation that may in part have been due at least in part to how my kids placed the stickers on them. Some went straighter than others more consistently and in general reminded my of a paper airplane when throwing or launching for how it may curve or go straight depending on how its thrown. they tend to quickly dive and crash if thrown too hard. The wheels on the bottoms of the planes did allow them when gliding in soft and straight to kind of land on harder surfaces like a driveway or table adding to the fun.The foam these are made out of is pretty durable and in general maintains its shape. For how rough my kids were with them I'm really surprised they didn't break them yet and at the worst maybe just dented and scuffed the nose on some of them.With how many gliders are in the set it was a blast for me and my 3 kids and their Grandpa. We had a ton of fun. My kids also really liked the stickers that came with them and while sliding the foam gliders together required my help on some the stickers gave them a way to finish it themselves.These slide together pretty quickly though in the larger set it took a minute to figure out which wings are the the ones for the larger planes vs smaller ones since each plane has a bigger center wing and then a smaller one on the tail. This second one on the tail really helped with stable flight. I recommend doing a better job of matching them up before you start assembly as with them all together it would be easier to get it right. we kind of just grabbed pieces that looked the right size and had a few mismatches at first.",
