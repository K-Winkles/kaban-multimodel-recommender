                "reviewText": "These are excellent little toy gliders for kids of all ages. From my two year old granddaughter to my 21 year old son to myself we have thoroughly enjoyed them and gotten literally hours of entertainment. Great value at about 3 for a dollar. They are what I expected and hoped which is simple, sturdy little gliders like those I played with as a kid. Would make excellent party favors. For young kids they are perfect for holding and running around making airplane noises. 2 year old just \u201chelped\u201d assemble it and then spent 2 hours waving it and running around everywhere. As expected It\u2019s now bent battered and missing the tail fin but still being used with a giant grin and major airplane enthusiasm. For older kids and adults They actually fly consistently once you figure out they are designed for a hard fast upward (45 deg) throw and they will accelerate up then do a loop and gracefully glide 20 feet around to the ground. My grown sons and I spent at least an hour in the yard on Father\u2019s Day throwing our planes. Trying different techniques and seeing how they respond, seeing if we could catch them after the loop, trying to hit each other or each other\u2019s planes, etc etc. and that was with just the same first 3 planes we opened. So yeah an older kids or adult can expect to get plenty of use without damage as these are pretty sturdy. And I still have 20 in the bag waiting for my friends and their kids to come over and hangout sometime. The nose cone is absolutely needed for flight due to the weight it adds. The propeller changes the flight a little (slows it down) but can be flown with or without the prop. The nose come and prop have some very small parts so keep away from really young children. For toddlers and young kids you can also skip the small prop and nose cone parts and just let them play with the plane and run around rather than fly it (young kids won\u2019t be able to throw these well enough for good flight anyway). Plus then those small parts are not a hazard. Best $8 I\u2019ve spent in a looong time. Thanks amazon!",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR - If you're looking for an RC plane, this isn't it. If you want something to have fun with that won't break the bank, these are a win.THESE. ARE. AMAZING. \"Now hold on a second Jimmy. They're foam...\" I'm gonna stop you right there and let you know that you're getting 24 of these magical flying doodads (that you must not let your 4 year old know that you have 24 of). See the trick is you spread this gimmick across multiple days every time one breaks. We've only replaced one so far.Let's set the stage: We had them out in the snow. Now, while they weren't the same after our 10 minute escapade, they still flew for another 2 days. That's not a typo. 2 days!!! They still work even though they've been wet, had tape on them to repair them (some did not survive the \"repair\"), and been thrown into everything - including their mother and the dogs. Now \"still work\" is relative here. Do they glide 8 miles? No. Do they go 5-10 feet? Sometimes. And that's when they're new. But when they don't, you laugh about it and throw it until it breaks or you \"remember\" you saw you had another and have them chill for a second.I hate disposable stuff, but we're all stuck doing nothing and this was a nice reprieve from the mundane. No one is gonna wax poetic about how beautiful these planes fly. But you'll get some belly laughs when one of them flies into a mixing bowl or gets into the bathroom right before a sibling does.",
