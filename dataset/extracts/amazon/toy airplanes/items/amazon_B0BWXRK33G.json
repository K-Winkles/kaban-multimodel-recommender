But when switched on, they play this awful, brain-melting music along with the airplane noises. The music was so unnecessary and I'm not sure why they added that feature. However, there's a quick fix. You'll unfortunately lose the plane noises too but keep the lights. Remove 3 screws, separate separate the top and bottle at the nose of the plane. Right in the nose you'll find a speaker with 2 wires attached to it. With tweezers or something small, pluck one of those wires off the speaker. Close the plane back up and put screws back in. The power switch will now just turn the lights on and off. I'll post a video showing all of this.Now without sound.... love these little planes!",

They are incredibly loud and play the same short song over and over non-stop, completely out of synch with one another. My child would turn them all on at once, then walk away, leaving me to listen to this atrocious sound by myself. Then when I turned them off, my child miraculously appeared from out of nowhere and turned them all back on again. Just horrible. In addition to the sound issue, they are all identical, so it\u2019s pretty pointless to have 4 unless you\u2019re giving them away to 4 different kids. Even then, I wouldn\u2019t do it because the sound of even one of them playing by itself is enough to completely annoy the parent of the child to whom you\u2019re giving the gift. I guess just buy it as a gift for a kid or kids if you don\u2019t like the parents and want to annoy them a lot.",

                "reviewText": "The planes are a pretty OK size. I would appreciate them to be a little bit bigger for toddlers. But they work for a 3 to four-year-old. The only reason I'm not giving this toy 5 stars is because it literally never turns off. if the switch is on the music is on and the lights are flashing. Even if it's been left alone for an hour. it plays the same 5 second song over and over and over Again",
