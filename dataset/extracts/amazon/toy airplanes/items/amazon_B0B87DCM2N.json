It flies far and is super fun. Pay attention to instructions where it recommends shooting at an angle for best results.QUALITY: Foam feels durable, like the stuff used to make starafoam coolers but with a little flex. I read reviews about the wheels comming off but in my experience it\u2019s the pretend cockpit with the lights that popped off. I put superglue and that\u2019s doing the job for now, if that doesn\u2019t hold I\u2019ll just tape it down.Still giving 5 stars because this is an excellent kid toy and at a great price. $9.99 at the time of my purchase.",
