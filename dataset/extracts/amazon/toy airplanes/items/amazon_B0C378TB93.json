Everything fits in a child's shoe box, no where near the size of the picture shown by seller. The play mat is not big enough for a toddler to even sit on. The toy cars are just cheap, extremely tiny pieces of plastic that a toddler definitely will choke on. I went to Walmart and bought a VTech car garage for a similar price and was so much happier. This gift made me cry made me very upset when I received it for my son, was supposed to be one of the BIG items and everyone is struggling right now. Amazon refunded the money to a GIFT CARD so i can't even get it back into my bank account for groceries or to shop somewhere else (since I bought a replacement toy) overall, horrible experience, don't buy this product ever, they need to remove the seller.",

He will play with the plane itself but all of the little parts for the track are too complicated for him at this point. We will keep it and he can grow into it.",
