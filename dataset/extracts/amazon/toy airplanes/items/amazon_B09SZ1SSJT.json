They all fly differently. Orange one does circles (not as fun in my opinion) and the other 2 fly in a more direct path. The light up feature is cool but I\u2019m not a huge fan of the wires just being taped to the outside. Not dangerous or anything per se just not clean and secured.",

I mean talk about wasted money. I couldn't send it back because it broke when using. I just bought another one and called it a day. If you buy for a 6 yr old, make sure he pulls that Tigger with a delicate touch.",

Glue that held the top of the plane to the foam body pulled apart almost immediately, and unfortunately I don't own a glue gun to repair it, so it went in the garbage the next month. Heed this review, these are cheaply made and unless u want to deal with fixing them after a few uses, don't waste the money!",
