Now she keeps looking to the sky to see the planes. Was looking for a nice toy plane for her to play with but wasn't finding any luck until I came across these! She loves them!! She flies them around, rolls them around, and zooms zooms them! They are super sturdy and nice sized for small hands to hang on too.",
