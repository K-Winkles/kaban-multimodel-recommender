                "reviewText": "This plane is a great for children or those who are into airplanes and want to start collecting airplanes on a budget. The aircraft has rollable wheels underneath the belly, but the front wheel does not roll. The fuselage of the aircraft is made from die-cast metal and of course it is painted. As many reviewers have commented along with a few of my friends who have never seen this plane toy before, most of them thought that this toy is quite cute and adorable.This is a classic airplane from Daron/Realtoy that is now painted to feature quite some details of the Delta colors. Some planes distributed by Daron have stickers on them, which would mean that stickers would peel easily if the plane is heavily used by children especially. Fortunately, this Delta Boeing 767 toy has been updated to feature painted details and drops the stickers. However, despite the fact that it is now painted, it can definitely be vulnerable to damages. If you're buying this for children, be sure to tell them to take good care of their planes as the planes are quite prone to scratches and chips if they bump or drop (or crash) their plane onto a hard surface. If you're buying this to put on display, then you will have no issues with the plane being damaged.Other than that, I really like this plane as I've put it on display or occasionally fly it around for fun as a grown adult to heal my inner child. It's a great plane for the price, although it may be a little pricey for some. This plane now belongs to a close friend of mine, and this plane would make a great gift for your loved ones or friends who are into airplanes (unless they are serious airplane collectors, in which you should consider the more expensive models like GeminiJets or NG models instead).",

                "reviewText": "I recently flew on a plane and wanted to get my four-and-a-half year old twins these models of planes since they love toys like this and they wanted to see a plane that Mommy flew on! I flew on Delta for this trip and the gift shop I stopped in was out of all of the Delta planes like this but they had several other airlines so I saw the brand and knew what to look for. Of course, I turned to Amazon and found that they have exactly what I wanted so I ordered two of these while sitting in the airport terminal since I promised my kids presents!These Daron Delta planes are the exact same ones sold in many airport gift shops so you can always order them before a child's first flight or if you can't find the airline you want in the gift shop. I ordered two of these Delta planes and my kids really like them! They are made of die-cast metal and some of the parts are made of plastic. There are plastic wheels on the bottom so the plane always has its landing gear down and it can roll on furniture and take off, which is what my kids love to do. The planes look similar to actual planes except these don't have the wing tips on them like the planes I was on. They measure almost six inches in length, five inches wide (wingspan), and 7/8 inches tall. They are made in China and are rated for ages four and up. They come in a box which makes it nice to give as a gift.My twins were really excited to get these and love playing with them! I had to demonstrate how a plane takes off, flies around, and lands, which fascinated them. Like other die-cast toys we have, they seem durable. The body of the plane is made of metal but the wings don't seem as durable so I wouldn't suggest throwing these too hard or they might break. The Delta logo, doors, and windows are all on stickers which could come off so I've been smoothing them down. The stickers are placed in the right spots but I just wish they were painted on so it would look nicer. Still, I'm happy with this product and the price I paid. If you have a child who is flying for the first time, you are looking for a gift, or the gift shop was out of planes, you can still find them! Overall, I'm happy with this product and I would buy these again!",
