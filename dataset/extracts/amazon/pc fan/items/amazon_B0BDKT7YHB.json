                "reviewText": "It's good for cleaning dust that accumulates on surfaces, but you would want to wear a mask while cleaning, and vacuum afterwords. If you have computers and electronics, it can do a pretty good job of cleaning inside the cases, although it doesn't provide as strong of an instant blast that canned air, or an air compressor can provide. But it is sufficient for cleaning most things that canned air would, and is still pretty decent on it's fastest speed setting. It's also a very handy tool for inflating air mattresses without needing a 12v accessory air pump, or a vehicle to power that in case you are camping, or just need to setup an air mattress. It's rechargeable, has a USB-C port, and comes with several accessories which is great. It might remind you of a rechargeable hair dryer that doesn't get hot, but is much more compressed and an indispensable tool. I stopped using my noisy, cumbersome, and time-consuming air compressor for most common tasks now that I have this. But of course it will not inflate tires like an air compressor can, so get the right tool for the right job and you will be happy.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a mostly great tool for cleaning dust out of places. It works quite well for guitar bridges and electronic devices that have lots of knobs (likely guitar pedals). I appreciate being able to keep my electronics mostly dust free without having to get into every nook and cranny of the surfaces, even areas where there are cords and cables can be dust free with relative ease. For most dust-laden spots, the brush attachment is more helpful as a little bit of physical force is needed. The only down side for this, is that it is not quite as powerful as compressed air cans.Compressed air cans have a bit more force coming out of their nozzle, which allows them to clear dust in harder to clean places better. This does a very good job, but not quite as much force. This will probably get most of the dust off of surfaces though.I think if there was an even smaller nozzle (i.e. similar to the nozzle you get with compressed air), it would probably be able to deliver that force that's needed for some of the harder to clean areas.I very much appreciate the USB-C port for charging, that's one less cable/power supply that I need to manage.Also note that the initial setting when you've turned it on is not the most powerful setting. Once you've held the button for 3 seconds to start it, it is on the lowest setting, short press the button again for the medium setting, and once again for the highest setting.",

                "reviewText": "I got it for the vacuum needs. Needed a low suction vacuum for electronics and desk. It does the job just fine. The air blower is a convenience, not as strong as canned but still will do the job (unless you have decades of dust and buildup created, but then no ordinary cleaning equipment will do the job hahah)The only thing that annoys me is the light, when you use the vacuum part of the machine the light will shine in your eyes. The power button could be situated in a better position, you will press it at some point, turning the machine off by accident. Besides that nice compact vacuum/blower that you can use for small jobs.",

                "reviewText": "I considered buying this air duster instead of buying another pack of compressed air because I was tired of having to rebuy them over and over.I wasn't surprised to see that it was a great replacement purchase. I was able to clean my electronics with it. It comes with different nozzles and the one I liked was the one that had bristles. It helped me clean hard to reach places that I would often have to keep spraying with an air can.Charging is easy, like charging your phone. The little LED may be hard to see at first but it clearly shows when it's done charging.Keep in mind that this product isn't super quiet. I use it during the day and using it at night might not be the best idea. Other than that I see no reason to not see this as a great replacement for compressed air cans.Pros:- no more buying compressed air cans- rechargeable- not huge, easy to store (comes with a soft fabric bag to keep in)- different nozzles help redirect air (thin end, long end, brush end, etc)- has three power settingsCons:- not super quiet. not super duper loud but loud enough to wake someone up- depending on usage, may need to charge more often- air pressure is constant (sometimes canned air had more of a punch at first and later would fade out, dont expect that punch at first. the power is still decently strong to dust off things)- some of the nuzzles may be hard to put on at first (too tight)Overall, I would recommend this product as it'll save me money from buying canned air. Since I can use it more often than canned air, I can dust most often and therefore this serves its purpose well.For anyone thinking about making the switch from canned air, this would be a solid place to start",
