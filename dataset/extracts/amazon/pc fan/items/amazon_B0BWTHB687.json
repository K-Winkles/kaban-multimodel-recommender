            "[Material] - Made of silicone material, which has good flexibility and elasticity, high-temperature resistance, aging resistance, and high chemical stability, is not easy to break and tear and has a long service time to use.",

Silicone rivet is another solution to further reduce the overall noise and vibration problems of the fans in addition to the use of silent fans.",
            "[Easy to Use] - Just use hand to install. No extra tools are required. Pass the rivet through the screw hole, and pull out the rivet in place by hand on the other side to complete the installation. Silicone rivet screws fit fans better than normal screws.",
            "[Applications] - Fits most open cases fan sizes and PC cases, etc. for all non-connection-type screw-hole fans.",
            "[Notice] - Not recommended to use for long-shaped screw holes in case of unstable fan installation. Short fan card slot type mounting rivet is not fit for connection type screw hole."
