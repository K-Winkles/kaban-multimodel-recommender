                "reviewText": "For those who do not know, PWM means that these fans have a 4-pin connector instead of a 3-pin connector. That 4th pin allows for your motherboard to control the speed of the fan depending on temperature (or custom if you tweak this in your BIOS or motherboard fan control software). This can help a lot with noise. With a 3-pin fan, it's going to run at full speed, all the time. With a 4-pin (and motherboard that supports it) it's going to run at whatever speed the motherboard thinks is necessary to keep things cool; usually slow under little/no load and fast as things heat up.These fans are quiet and work well. I recently used them in an Antec C80 case build for a blacked-out build and they look and work great!",

For 5 PWM fans, the price is very reasonable. They function well at the same time. I used the included hub to connect all my case fans with the fan header from the motherboard and was able to set a reasonable temperature curve. The fans are overall quiet, even at max speed.I'm very happy with this product so far and thus would recommend it. I hope you find this review helpful and I appreciate that.",
