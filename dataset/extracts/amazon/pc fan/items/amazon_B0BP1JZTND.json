                "reviewText": "I built a huge PC that required 8 ARGB fans and 4 lighted heatsinks for my ram. I also wanted the convenience of a wireless remote because the wired controller I had was not able to be mounted in a convenient place outside the case. This unit solved those issues. Some of my fans were of different manufacturers due to being different sizes and used for different purposes. As long as they have standard connections for 3-4 pin motherboard fan headers and 3 pin ARGB connectors, you can connect up to 10 fans with both power and RGB on this one unit. Even if you have an older motherboard with a limited amount of fan headers, you can use this unit to expand your ability to add more fans RGB or not and it even includes a place to connect the CPU fan. The remote gives you allot of functionality including static and pattern schemes especially when your motherboard does not support ARGB computer programs. The only gripe I had about this unit was the fact that the ARGB plugs are a little cumbersome to plug in and remain connected. They are loose and a little challenging to line up. My biggest advice to you is that you make sure you have standard ARGB fan connectors on all your fans before buying. I had several other fans, but they came with proprietary connectors either to their own fan hub or their own controllers. In allot of cases, you can get them to work if some part of their connection is standard ARGB, but then you end up with allot of cable management issues. I like the fact that the connections are standard. There are so many fans and other RGB accessories that will connect with this unit perfectly. The colors and patterns all match and look great. Overall, I am buying more of theses for other builds. For the price, I really like what it offers and I would recommend it for builders who need allot of connectivity and RGB options",

                "reviewText": "Never heard of this brand but there isn\u2019t a lot of universal pwm/Argb hubs on the market. All the \u201cname brand\u201d hubs all work specifically with their stupid proprietary connectors. This hub works with normal/standard pwm/Argb connectors that are standardized with motherboard headers. Most brands fans have proprietary fan connectors and then the connectors from the hub to the board are standardized. This hub was plug and play with no software needed(for remote control use). I wanted a hub+remote setup because this was being used in a home Nas I built with spare parts+new fans running unraid and while there are dockers/apps in unraid for controlling rgb it\u2019s more complex than it needs to be so I wanted something I could control with a remote instead of software. I rolled the dice on this random cheap brand and couldn\u2019t be happier. My only small complaint is that the magnet really should be stronger with all ports populated the magnet isn\u2019t strong enough to hold it to the case. You\u2019ll either need to mount it with a command strip, another stick on magnet that is stronger, or tuck it away some where as the included magnet is very weak. Other than that this is a really good piece of kit. Disclaimer: I can\u2019t testify to how well this will work with motherboard software/3rd party rgb software since I am using it with the remote. It has responded and works well with the fan curves I set in my bios but as with most hubs you only get to set 1 curve per hub since all pwm functions correlate to the fan connected to the first slot of the hub.",

The hub itself has an inbuilt led that syncs with the fans which looks pretty cool. The included remote allows for a variety of color effects and works from several feet away through my metal case. It really brings my build together and I'm very pleased with how well it works for such a low price. Definitely recommend.",
