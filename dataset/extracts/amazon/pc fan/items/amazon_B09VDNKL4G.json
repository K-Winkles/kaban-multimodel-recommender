Contamination and high temperatures affect this bearing much less than ordinary sleeve or ball bearings. Therefore, the double ball bearing is the perfect choice if you want to ensure continuous operation at maximum speed. Please note that ball bearings have a physically higher bearing noise compared to conventional sleeve bearings. Extremely Wide Speed Range Building up on the success of the P12 PWM, the P12 Max extends the controllable speed to an impressively wide range from 200 RPM up to 3300 RPM. This enables a quiet operation when low airflow is needed and also an unprecedented level of performance on heatsinks and radiators. The P12 Max provides a significant performance boost to existing air and water cooling solutions. Maximum Performance - Without Compromises The P12 Max delivers focused airflow and high static pressure, making it suitable for all scenarios. The fan is optimised for use on radiators, heat sinks, pinholes and mesh. Therefore, the P12 Max is the ideal fan for enthusiasts and professionals who are looking for maximum performance with a long service life. 0dB Mode - Zero RPM The fan speed can be throttled down to standstill via PWM. This allows silent operation in IDLE and at the same time ensures maximum performance when required. Thus, the P12 Max allows an incomparably dynamic adjustment of the speed, so that the airflow can be perfectly regulated for every case.",

Great performance.The caveat is the dual-ball bearing design. It creates a very subtle high-pitched sound audible especially at low RPMs. I do not like the overall sound profile particularly, but I still like the fan because I really have to get close and listen carefully for it to be that noticeable when the fan is in my case when the case is fully assembled. Different story when my case is open and I'm tweaking things, obviously.I didn't run into the QC issues a lot of other people seem to have, so there's that. If you get a good one and are not irritated by the sound profile, it's one of the best values on the market.",

I was an owner of the original P12, and despite their positive reviews I was unimpressed. The original fans would produce a weird whine noise at lower RPM, and the quality seemed cheap to me. These fans shattered my expectations. They feel heavy duty compared to the old ones and the odd whine is no longer an issue. They are loud at higher rpms, but don't seem any louder than other fans I've used.",

At that, and only that, they succeed.I have six of them, and they all have the same pros and cons:The pros:1) If used as an exhaust or an unfiltered intake fan, they move a better than normal amount of air. You can feel the difference on your hand. As exhaust through a radiator, they work very well.2.) They are almost as quiet as a normal Arctic fan.3.) They are inexpensive.The cons:1) They don't suck through a filter very well at all. In fact, they are worse than a normal Arctic fan in that setup.2) At maximum speed, they have an annoying high-pitched whine.3) Like the rest of their Arctic brethren, they are fragile. You'd better use a pair of grill guards with each. Internal wire or external finger, if contact is made, you will lose a blade. Maybe even some blood, these things are sharp.Having said all of that, I like them. Any better fan would cost 3-4 times as much. I use them wherever I need a fan blowing into a restricted space or I need more air in an unfiltered location.Radiators, exhaust, air coolers, with grills where needed.Just inspect them upon arrival and treat them gently and you'll be fine.",

I did get a few with a bad and audible Bearing at low RPM's, the kind of noise i know from experience is preliminary to a failing and really squeaky bearing, but I will just buy more and continue till I get all Ace's.

                "reviewText": "I'm a huge fan (ha...) of Arctic's pressure optimized fans. I run eleven of them in my case; six on my 360mm AIO CPU radiator, four on my 240mm AIO GPU radiator, and one 140mm exhaust. Great pressure for blowing through radiators, quiet, and perform similarly enough to Noctua's offerings where the \"losses\" are negligible. Considering they all cost about $9 each, the Arctic P12 is a brilliant piece of engineering. So, imagine my excitement when I found out Arctic improved the P12, gave it a better bearing, higher RPM, and all the techtubers who reviewed it all said it beats Noctua in noise normalized testing... and it did it at the same price as the P12! I bought thirteen *immediately*. Ten for my current layout, two more when I upgrade to dual 360mm radiators, and heck... one for a spare.Regret.1. Out of thirteen fans, ten were plagued with noisy bearings. They would either whine, click, or rattle under LOW operation (30% RPM). No extra noise if they were running full tilt, but I don't need a leaf blower in my PC.2. The \"feature\" where the fan turns off at 5% PWM is wrong. The fans will completely stop at 25% PWM, so 30% is the lowest fan speed I can set. For the record, none of my current Arctic fans do this. They will change RPM as low as 5% PWM, they just won't turn off unless I set it to zero.I am of the mindset where I want my PC to be cool AND quiet, so I generally set my fans to spin at the highest possible RPM while still being almost inaudible at 3ft/1m away. For the Arctic P12, that's roughly 50% PWM (about 1000 RPM) which is as high as you can go before you get the infamous \"whine\" on the P12. Even then, at 50% PWM, my CPU and GPU stay well under 70\u00b0C when gaming. Cool and quiet.I did heed the reviews here and made sure to test each fan I got before installing them. Foolishly, I tested each fan at 100% RPM with an external power supply, but didn't think to see how loud they would be at lower RPMs. The noise made from the P12 Max convinced me that I just couldn't have my cake and eat it too, which sucks... because removing two radiators, installing ten fans, and cable managing the whole thing is two hours of time I won't get back.Arctic, I love you guys... but come on.",

La configuraci\u00f3n de la corriente de aire es de adelante hacia atr\u00e1s: 1 frontal, 2 CPU y 1 trasero.Pienso que a los usuarios a los que no les funcionaron los ventiladores quiz\u00e1 es porque sus Placas Base no son del todo compatibles con PWM... Habr\u00eda que actualizar el BIOS o comprar una PB m\u00e1s reciente.En resumen, me encuentro muy contenta con la adquisici\u00f3n de estos 4 ventiladores! El disipador torre que tengo nunca me ha fallado; por lo tanto, considero que Arctic es una empresa comprometida con la satisfacci\u00f3n de sus clientes; esto anterior, a pesar de ciertos comentarios, hizo que comprara los ventiladores.Gracias, Arctic! Ahora solo espero que duren funcionando los 6 a\u00f1os que ustedes prometen! Aunque quiz\u00e1 para ese entonces ya haya comprado otros m\u00e1s hahaha",

This fan is very popular right now and pretty hard to find and sadly there are sellers trying to take advantage of this.That said the P12 Max is a great fan. It's very quiet but still pushes a ton of air. I've found it more than competitive for most cooling tasks. Really for around $18 Canadian it's amazing.The bottom line is for 16-18 dollars Canadian I don't think there's another fan on the market that can compete with it. Of course if you need to push max air and decibels aren't an issue something like Phanteks T30 is obviously superior but for 80% of the people and use cases this is the fan to get imo - that is if you're not being gouged on price by a greedy seller.I hope you found this review helpful.",

Son ruidosos pero es comprensible ya que tiene unas velocidades muy altas (200\u20133300rpm), si los tienes sobre los 2000-2200 como l\u00edmite no suenan apenas. Adem\u00e1s se pueden poner a 0rpm por si no es necesario que giren. Por el precio que tienen son totalmente recomendables, pero si no vais a tocar los rpm tener en cuenta que van a meter ruido si van a altas velocidades.",
