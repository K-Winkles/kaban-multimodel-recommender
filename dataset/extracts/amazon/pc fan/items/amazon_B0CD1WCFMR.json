This fan did the trick on helping my modem/router lower its temperature and perform better.The fan itself feels of good quality and is very powerful with a nob to control the speed, the faster speeds do get just a little noisy but for the amount of air it pushes it's normal. It's been running for almost two months now and so far no problems, so very happy with the fan, and hopefully it lasts long. So for the performance, quality and use I give it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I go this initially to use to remove fumes when soldering electronics projects, and it does a great job for that, but there are so many ways to use such a versatile little fan. Being able to plug it directly into a 110v outlet just provides so many options, and the variable speed controller lets one tune the speed and noise level to the use case. Eventually I adopted this to use in a DIY 3D printer enclosure to remove fumes from the enclosure before they could escape into the room. It has been fantastic for this use case, and the slightly noisy high speed wine when being run at higher speeds isn't an issue at all in that somewhat noisy environment. I found the kit to be very complete with high quality feet and finger guards making it safe to use on the desktop as well as inside an enclosure. Having permanently mounted it to the 3D printer enclosure, I find myself needing another one for all the miscellaneous other things it is can be useful for.",

Effectively, this is the same package as the other, and at the time of ordering, listed at very similar prices. The differences boil doing to minute, mostly cosmetic, differences in the fan and *slightly* shorter feet. Both have been in operation for over a few weeks, and both reach the same brutal speeds of 4000+ rpm.Honestly, my conclusions over there apply the same here: these fans are more than the sum of their parts. They are not piddly computer fans; they move large amounts of air when turned up. They're super easy to use, stand up on their sides quite well. Huge variation in fan RPM, everything from fully silent to really going.I genuinely am surprised by all of it. Both have been in near non-stop use from the moment they arrived at my door--thats how useful this is.",

                "reviewText": "This thing pushes air. Lots of it. When I cranked the power up to max, face-down, it lifted itself off the table. Keep fingers away from the blades, it will leave a painful mark!I ran it at full blast for 48 hours to see if anything developed. No change. I stuck a pen in it at full speed, it stopped, no damage to the blades (but no auto shutdown or anything, so it was drawing full power still--worrisome). I dropped it. I used it outside (for testing--this is NOT an outdoor fan) in the dust/dirt for a few hours (ensuring it got dirty.) It didn't break, slow, develop new noises, etc.It's loud. I'd say on par with one of those 1U server fans.Satisfied that it pushed air well, I cleaned it up and then stuck it to the passive vents on my PC case, it vented enough air to help cool the GPU while gaming. I think I'd use a quieter fan, for a gaming rig or home office though.Currently mounted to a switch in my server closet, and keeping the temperatures down. Ultimately this will get mounted to to a flex-arm on the workbench for ventilating and/or cooling items.After playing with it, I'm likely going to get more of these and connect them to computer controlled power, so I can control fan speeds/throughput with standard barrel connectors.All in all, I really like this thing, except for the noise. I would not use this fan if you need it running full blast, in any noise sensitive environment. If you can run slower, it would be OK in an office, bedroom, terrarium, etc. But at full power, the noise of this fan is more suitable for industrial/server room uses.",
