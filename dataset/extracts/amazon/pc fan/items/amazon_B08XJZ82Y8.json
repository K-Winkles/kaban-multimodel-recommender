                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These fans are on the pricey side for sure but honestly they are worth every penny! I recently had to return these other coolermaster halo fans i had bought because after just 2 months of use they started making a very loud humming noise that made me want to rip my hair out. When i found these fans i knew right away they would be good since corsair products have always been great for me. You can barely hear these fans, even when gamming they are still quiet. The install process was not as bad as i thought it was going to be, it is pretty straight fwrd. I will say that the fans do have 2 cords on them though, one is for the power and the other is for the RGB lights, it was not a deal breaker for me though it just meant i had to get a little creative to figure out how to hide all the cords. I can not comment on the software for these fans because i have no desire to use it, the default RGB lighting pattern is honestly not bad. These fans also seem to move air well as my temps are staying in the safe zone for heat levels. If you are looking for fans that are good performance wise and look fancy along with staying quiet then buy these they are wonderful!update: It has been about 8-9 months since i got these fans and they are still going strong with no issues at all. The RGB lights are still working just as well as they did when i got them. I will most likely be buying more in the future to replace my non RGB fan in the back of my PC case and my non RGB fans that are on the top of my PC case. The fans are also still just as quite as they were when i got them too.",

I have a mostly corsair build so I just had to get some corsair fans for that extra customization feature to be well utilized. These bright fans look so beautiful and are even better when paired with other iCue RGB corsair products. As for cooling, these fans provide very good airflow in my case and keep things cool well under 50C. I actually bought 2 sets of these 140mm fans and compared them with 2 sets of the 3x120mm fans. The set of 120mm fans scored slightly better temperatures (1-3 degree difference from each temperature sensor) but due to the way fans work, the bigger fans still provided more air flow at similar speeds which made them win out in the end. The sound level seemed similar but I don't have a device to see which group of fans was louder.There are some corsair fans that are more expensive but I went with these as they were middle ground and matched the ones that came with my case (although different size than the 3x120mm that came with my case) they were the same model so the had the same RGB light style. In the future, I may give the LL series a try to compare but they are quite pricey when put up against the SP series. Other than that, I highly recommend these fans if you are thinking of a corsair RGB build for your next pc build. If you want just RGB, these still do great as corsair is a great brand but there are other great brands out there as well.",

                "reviewText": "This fan works flawlessly. I've used it for quite a bit now, and I can tell you this fan is worth it for the price. The fans are pretty quiet despite having all the same fans (except for the top ones in the photo). I honestly was expecting another air conditioner sound level when I'm gaming. But I've tested and maxed out the fan speed, and the noise was really impressive, definitely better than those cheap Lenovo Legion fans I used to have. My old fans don't compare to these Corsair fans. Depending on the chassis you're using, I would also like to point out that these fans are bright . . . with 4 of the same fans installed in my chassis, I don't even need an RGB strip to see my components inside the case. Also very fast shipping too, my new motherboard didn't even come in yet. Just make sure that you have a Corsair fan controller. Other than that, I have no complaints, and I am happy with my purchase.",
