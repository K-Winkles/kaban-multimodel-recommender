Just a little less performance than I expected.",

                "reviewText": "Update: RMA replacement was also defective with a noisy bearing at all RPMs. 2/3 working isn't a good stat...I bought these because mounting the 27mm P14 ARGB to a radiator is a pain when the screws are 30mm long. 3mm is not a very big margin if you need a pump mount or spacer attached.The noise profile is substantially similar to the P14 ARGB as is the performance. The P14 might be slightly higher performing but it also has another 2mm to work with so I give it a pass. The LED brightness is lower % for % against the P14 but is acceptable.Quality control seems to be questionable. All five fans vibrate slightly differently, 3 of them were nearly perfect, one vibrates a little more than the others, and one makes a bearing rubbing noise at all RPMs. The noisy one is getting RMA'd as defective.The frame sits flush with radiators on the rear, but the front of the frame is recessed and leaves a gap. I presume this is so the RGB can be seen in pull applications. If you are performance minded, you may want to tape this gap up.",

Maybe I will try a PWM sped controller to slow it down even more, but then it won\u2019t do the cooling task very well. Find another way.",

It has a great 0 RPM feature to be silent when your PC is idling, if you set the PWM percentage below about 15% it will stop spinning, not many fans have this easy to use feature. I control my fans with the basically named \"Fan Control\" software so I can have the fans be silent when my CPU and GPU aren't hot, I won't buy another fan without this feature, its great. I wish it had an extra PWM female plug so you could daisy chain fans together like my Arctic P14's but this is a more budget oriented fan. At regular price these are good but if you can get them on sale they will be great value. I hope Cooler Master makes a 140mm version of this fan.",
