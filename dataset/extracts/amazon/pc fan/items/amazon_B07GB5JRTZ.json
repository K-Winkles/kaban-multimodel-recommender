The fan assures extremely efficient cooling, even with increased air resistance. Therefore, the P12 PWM is particularly suitable for use on heatsinks and radiators. Extended Life Span A 10 \u00b0C lower motor temperature roughly doubles the life span of a fan. The new ARCTIC motor has a four times longer service life through its low coil temperature. 200 to 1800 RPM regulated via PWM Thanks to the 4-pin connector, the RPM can be regulated in a broad spectrum via PWM. In this way, noise is kept at a minimum while maximum cooling performance is assured when needed. High Quality Bearing Thanks to an alloy/lubricant combination developed in Germany, friction within the bearing is reduced and greater efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development as well as less bearing noise, which means you can enjoy a longer service life from your fan.",

I didn't realize how dirty my PC was at the bottom until I used a flash.Secondly, you can see that the top two fans are attached to a 240mm radiator. This is an NZXT Kraken X52. Since I overclock my CPU I need the fans running at 100% and the NZXT fans were quite loud and only chilled the CPU to 62\u00b0C under load.I purchased five ARCTIC P12 PWM fans (four for the back and front of the radiator and one for the drive bays at the bottom). The temperature dropped to 57\u00b0C and the sound is at least half as noticeable.I ended up moving the NZXT fans to the bottom of the case so they could force fresh air up into the GPU. Since they are being run at 60% speed, the noise is a little less unbearable. On the top and back of the case are Lian-Li SL120 Unifans running at 60%.I am planning on building a rig with zero RGB and I will be using 10 of these fans for the cooling. They are the best cooling fans I have ever used for static pressure.Case - Lian-Li Lancool IIMotherboard - ASUS AM4 TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (Wi-Fi)CPU - AMD 5600XGPU - ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 3070 O8G GamingRAM - CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 64GB (4 x 16GB) DDR4 3600SSD - Samsung 980 PRO M.2 500GBCPU cooler - NZXT Kraken X52 240mm AIOPSU - Antec HCG750 Gold 750W Fully ModularRGB fans - Lian Li SL120 Unifan",

The chain feature is very nice to reduce cable clutter where all are going to the same place and also to match the speed across the chained fans for easier management. The materials feel very nice as well.The only thing is that I wish the included screws were black instead of silver but in most cases, your PC case should include mounting screws that probably match the theme.",

The PWM feature is also a nice addition, allowing me to easily adjust the fan speed and noise level depending on my needs.What really sets this fan apart from others I've used in the past is how quiet it is. The motor is practically silent, even when running at full speed. This is a welcome change from other fans that can be loud and distracting during use. Wish it had rgb or led",

I use them in my 011-Air as a test once other RGB fans costing 3x failed and I'd recommend them in any application.They are better fans than what you could get for $20 each a decade ago.Only thing better are the Noctua redux for the price. Don't fall for the RGB hype. I've had 3 Silverstone AIO fans fail with the one below these 2 on it's way out! It'll be replaced by a p12 once it fails!Spend money on the things that matter. 1. PSU 2.mobo 3. The highest end CPU you can afford 4. A GPU that will leap frog the next gen(don't upgrade each release!) and last but not least.... Don't fall for the \"PCI Express Gen 4\" hype.There are many gen 3 nvme drives that outperform the cheap Gen 4 drives. Like my ignorance in buying an sn750se \"gen 4\"..... It's slower than the sn750 Gen 3 I was going to replace it with!I would also recommend that if you can afford it absolutely do not even think about hooking your computer directly to a wall or a surge protector! Just get one of the cheap APC battery backups as it will save your components and you will notice all of the random bugs and glitches and failures don't happen anymore because not only does your power supply clean your dirty power from the grid you've also got an amazing backup that might not run your PC for 10 minutes but absolutely absorbs spikes dips and everything in between.I wish I had learned that a decade ago. I would still have a 3Dfx voodoo 5 55500 if I'd not been gaming in a storm without an actual surge protector!I would gladly pay twice what they charge for these fans. If they release the maglev bearing version I think they could absolutely go head to head with noctua!",
