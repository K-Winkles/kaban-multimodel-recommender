                "reviewText": "I installed these new fans as soon as I got them, and so far so good. They look phenomenal and work perfectly with my build. I'm currently having no issues with them and the LCD screens look perfect.Despite them working perfectly, there are some things that you should know. First, the controller requires a PCIe connection so make sure you have an extra one. This is the same one that most graphics cards use. Thankfully my PSU had some spare connections for me to use, so I was fine.Second, the website states that it requires a direct connection to a usb header on your motherboard. Make sure you have one of those as well. You can technically use a splitter for this but it most likely needs to be powered to be able to function correctly. I have not tested this out myself but may do so in the future.Third, I've watched some previews of these fans from some tech youtubers and as they recommended, tested out the fans before installing them, because the fans need to be updated with the L-Connect 3 software that's required for them. When you do the update, sometimes one of the fans, will show a black screen. A restart of the software or even restarting your computer won't fix it. What you need to do is turn off your PC, and just switch the fans around in the link configuration. That's exactly what happened to my middle fan, the LCD just turned off but everything else was functioning perfectly. Switched the middle fan to one of the outside ones, relinked them, and turned on my PC and all the LCD screens were working perfectly. After that, I installed them and finished the setup.Besides those three little things, the fans function perfectly, the L-Connect 3 software for them is easy to use and you can easily change the content of the LCDs to static pictures, gifs, mp4 or other custom animations that they currently have. I'm sure they're going add more animations later but you can easily add your own.Make sure you get the right version though for your airflow needs. I bought the reverse ones because I needed them as intake fans and wanted the LCDs to face the correct orientation. Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "These fans work just fine from a practical standpoint: the provide good air intake for my case. However the main thing that makes them so unique is faulty or broken at best. LCD screens on the fans seem to have a mind of their own and will eventually switch to the default Lian li logo after a random amount of time. What should be seen is the cpu temp, gpu temp, and gpu load. Very disappointing considering how much these things cost\u2026.",

I\u2019m not a fan of the TL model in general compared to the SL-INF, but the TL LCDs add a new level of technology. Depending on placement and GPU size, the LCD screens might get covered up, but it looks so right with my build. Because of the screen, there\u2019s less surface area, but still moves a lot of air. When these were first announced, people thought they would cost 100s of dollars, so big kudos to Lian Li for developing these and releasing them at the price they are",
