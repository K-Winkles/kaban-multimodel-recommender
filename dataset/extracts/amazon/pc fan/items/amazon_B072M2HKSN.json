By adjusting the NA-FC1\u2019s speed control dial, users can either manually set a PWM duty cycle from 0 to 100% or reduce the PWM duty cycle supplied by PC motherboards in order to have the fans running slower than the automatic motherboard fan control would allow. While the brightness of the orange status LED provides visual feedback on the current dial setting, the push button allows the NA-FC1 to be switched into \u201cno stop\u201d mode, which prevents the fan from falling below a speed of 300rpm. Thanks to the supplied 3-way split cable and power supply adaptor, up to 3 fans can be controlled simultaneously.",

Power supply adaptor As powering multiple higher wattage fans from a single motherboard fan header may damage the motherboard, the NA-FC1 includes an NA-AC4 adaptor that powers the device directly from the power supply unit while simultaneously receiving PWM input from the motherboard and forwarding RPM information. This makes it ideal for controlling multiple high-speed fans such as Noctua\u2019s 3000rpm industrialPPC models. 3-way splitter cable The supplied 3-way splitter cable allows the connection of up to three 4-pin PWM fans in order to control them simultaneously. Even more fans can be controlled at once when using additional NA-YC1 splitter cables that are supplied with many Noctua fans and available as an optional accessory kit (NA-SYC1). \u201cNo stop\u201d mode If the small push button is pressed and the green status LED is on, the NA-FC1 operates in \u201cno stop\u201d mode, which means that it will not allow the fan to fall below 300rpm, regardless of the speed setting and the input PWM duty cycle from the motherboard, thus avoiding BIOS fan errors.",

Extremely useful for all kinds of fan speed applications. If you don't want to hassle with bios for a bit of extra air for a short time this product is great. Go from an external 12v power source to 4 pin splitters to these devices to more splitters and multiple fans and set up a major cooling set-up with fan speeds to suit your setup. Set up different size fans and fan speeds at different locations. Want to set up a fan/s to add cooling your old hot running laptop these are perfect for that as well.

It controls the speed from off to full, which is nice to shut the fan off without unplugging it.For this application, I did not want one of the controllers that has a set temperature, I just want to set the speed of the fan directly. Also the PWM speed control in the fan that this controller talks to is smaller and quieter than the linear voltage regulators in many alternative controllers.",

A SATA power adapter is included but I didn't need it.I wish these were cheaper, but I couldn't find anything similar on the market that had good build quality, a good reputation, and are so compact.",

                "reviewText": "I created a system to provide cooling for an AV cabinet in a closet. Components include Aventage, Emotiva and Oppo. The cooling equipment used includes:1. Noctua Fans (3) (model# NF-S12A PWM)2. Noctua Fan controller (model# NA-FC1)3. Noctua Extension cables (model# NA-SEC1)4. Cablemod's molex to SATA cable (model# CM-CAB-MSAP 45KK-R)5. Coolerguys AC power adaptor (110V AC to DC 12V Power Supply with 4 pin Molex)The fans are laid flat on top of the receiver and amplifier pulling air up through the units. Of course, the anti-vibration corner pieces protect the AV equipment and prevent the fans from moving around. There is approximately 4\" between the top of each AV component and the shelf above. This seems to allow sufficient air circulation.All Noctua components were packaged nicely and functioned perfectly out of the box. Connections are solid. Using the fans full speed, they are very quiet and are effective in keeping the components at less than 82F degrees. The Noctua Fan Controller is tiny -- about the size of a man's thumb.When setting up the system, I reached out to Noctua for some technical assistance. They were prompt and provided excellent guidance on connecting the power supply to the speed control (Cablemod's connector).The Cablemod's cable has solid connections and functions well. The only thing that would be nice is an outer sheath to keep all four wires together for a cleaner appearance.The Coolerguys AC power adaptor appears well made and functions well to power the three fans.Overall, the system has been running for about 1 month and I am quite satisfied with each of the components and would recommend them to anyone looking for an effective cooling system for an AV cabinet.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars I absolutely love this fan controller, but it has a few annoying design quirks.",
                "reviewText": "-One of the main reasons I love this fan controller is its compact package and ease of use. It is a little pricey for a fan controller, but it works very well and it has exceptional build quality. The dial that controls the fan speed does not wobble or feel like it's going to fall off, so I expect this controller to last a long time. It has been running for a few months now without any issues.-Although I love the NA-FC1 for the aforementioned reasons, one of my main gripes about it is the way that the fans plug into the controller. Since both plugs are on opposite ends, it is rather challenging to place the controller itself outside of my case, as the wires easily get twisted and want to bend back to their original shape. If both plugs were on the same side, then I could place the fan controller on top of my case with the fan cables extending from the drive bay.-It can handle 3 amps of current, which should be more than enough for people with normal case fans. However, I enjoy tinkering with powerful server fans, and I have had to limit which ones I buy due to the 3 ampere current limitation. 3 amps is somewhat of a middle ground; many server fans are rated for under 3 amps, although the most powerful can draw even more current that would overwhelm the NA-FC1. I have spent hours and hours combing through Amazon to try and find a PWM controller that can handle these fans that (and can be directly plugged into my computer power supply), but I have always turned up empty-handed. I am always led back to the NA-FC1 simply due to it being the highest-current PWM fan controller I can find that doesn't require any fiddling to get it working. I would love it if Noctua made a beefier version of the fan controller that could handle currents in excess of 6-7 amperes, but I don't know if Noctua (or any other company) is ever planning to make one like that in the future.",

                "reviewText": "This is aimed at 4 pin fans that utilize pulse width modulation (PWM).Other controllers sometimes use resistors to lower the voltage which can cause issues with some fans.This keeps the voltage at 12V and varies the duty cycle which is a much more precise method of speed control.Simply connect the supplied power cable on one end (sata or motherboard \"cpu fan\") and the fan to the other.I bought a cheap motherboard that ran the CPU fan at full speed all the time and it was very noisy (and not necessary to run the fan that fast), but the BIOS has no provision for fan control.This worked very well. I can run the fan to where the noise/speed is tolerable and the CPU stays cool.",
