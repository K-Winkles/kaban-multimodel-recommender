Instructions were inadequate and incomprehensible. No way to enter a fan curve nor is one already present. Steps the fans up a few hundred RPM when alarm temperature is achieved but not full speed. Of course by then the alarm is beeping which nullifies any benefit. The unit does not appear to employ a feedback loop which is essential for a temperature controlled device. The whole point of an automated controller is to avoid alarm condition not employ it as as a basic function. I will be removing it from my sight. These controllers appear to be all the same with different brands. If you want eye candy, place your order. If you're serious about controlling temps, look elsewhere.",
