The quick way is, when the logo sticker is facing you it will suck in air, and if the sticker is on the other side then it\u2019s the outtake. Do these fans come with connection cables or do you need to buy them separately? They come with connection cables but not include the hub. Can these be mounted to the case or only on radiators?

                "reviewText": "Based on the appearance of the plastic molding and the published specifications, these PinXun Model PX12025 fans, here offered under the name \"DARKROCK\", are the same as - or extremely similar to - the fans offered under another line. A claimed 47.8CFM with 32.1DbA noise matches up. The multipack sticker of \"CP-FAN-120BK3\" is also available under the PinXun name elsewhere. There was no \"DARKROCK\" branding anywhere on anything, other than the inventory sticker. I don't have a wind tunnel to validate the specs, but they seem pretty normal for a medium-low flow, medium-low pressure, medium-high noise lower-tier fan. OK if you just want to fill an empty fan space.",
