It \"feels\" light and possibly flimsy but actually it's construction is pretty solid. This hub is the best option to control the speed of multiple (together not individually) and addressable lighting with your motherboard's default software. This will not work with fans like Corsair or Liang Li's Uni fans that have a proprietary connectors. I'm using it with 7 Fractal Design Prisma fans and it's wonderful only using AuraSync to control everything.I only have 3 minor issues with the product. Neither of them I feel are deal breakers.1) The PWM sockets are super tight. It requires a lot more force than one would think to be necessary to unplug a fan. I was afraid of stripping the fan wires from the connectors stuck in the hub. Adversely, the RGB sockets are incrediblely loose.2) The PWM / ARGB signal-in cable at first was not receiving the RGB signal from the motherboard (PWM signal was fine). Even though that lead in to the hub had snapped in, the connection was not tight enough. Once again I had to apply more force to get it work.3) Would have been nicer if it had a magnetic strip than Velcro.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Once you get it to work, this product works as advertised. It connects your 3 pin RGB devices and 4 pin PWM fan power cords in one place which is useful if you only have a single addressable RGB header on your motherboard. It can even accept some daisy-chaining; I have four of the fans daisy-chained together and fed into one RGB port (those were power connected by MOLEX though in a separate configuration directly to the power supply, so you would probably need to actually connect the fans individually to the PWM ports for power).The tolerances are a bit tight on the PWM side and too loose on the RGB side. The worst tolerance though is the SATA connector. Plugging it in gives the peripherals power without any issue, but the data side where the RGB info is transferred just does not fit well with your standard SATA connection. It requires a LOT of force on the SATA connector in order for the hub to recognize the RGB. I would sometimes find that the connection would come loose and all the RGB disappears since that part of the SATA connection would no longer be recognized by the hub.Ultimately what made it work consistently was adding a large zip-tie shown (and tying it very tight) across the length of the hub to securely hold the SATA connector to the hub.It works great though with their RGB strips though, you could either daisy-chain them together or use a splitter to feed into the hub. My motherboard is an ASRock X570 Taichi and the hub is Polychrome Sync compatible, which is nice.Overall, I would recommend this once they fix some of the tolerance issues.Edit: After a month of use, I can't consistently get the RGB half of the SATA connector to stay connected, even using the zip-tie workaround. It would blink on and off at times, forcing me to fiddle with the SATA connection until it lights up again. Dropping a star as a result :(",
