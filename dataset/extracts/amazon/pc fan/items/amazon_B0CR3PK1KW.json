The reverse fans (RX120) have grey fan blades.If you don't want them to be an eyesore in your system, order 2 rx120s and hopefully your GPU will hide them enough. The AX120 match the rear case fan that came with the case. one other note, these fans come with rubber cushions for each mounting screw. One of the rear cushions was missing on 1 of the fans that I ordered, but fortunately the 4 on the front are spares. I used the \"spares\" to cushion the 4 fans that came with the case, as these fans have none.",
