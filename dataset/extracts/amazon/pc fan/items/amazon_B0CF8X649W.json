After buying RGB fans you will see different types of plugs, this hub uses the fans that have the normal small 3 pin female plug and also a larger wider different 3 pin female plug as a Y type cable from your fan. Make sure they are both connected in order to power the fan and lights simultaneously. If you only connect one side you will get only fan power, if you only connect the other side you will only get light control and fan will stay off. Make sure your fans have both connections on a Y cable coming out of your fan. Not compatible with Corsair fans due to that proprietary connections they use for their own hubs/controller. Cyberpower fans had the connections I needed for this hub. Overall if you have the fans and need a legit and reliable controller/hub and you are sure you have the multiple connectors coming out of your fans, USE THIS.",
