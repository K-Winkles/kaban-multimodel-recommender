These Okinos fans are pretty good with good airflow management, and good looks.

Also the hub that came included with it is pretty convenient.",

                "reviewText": "Usually very suspicious of off brand electronics, but alot of the major brands didnt have a 120mm fan with 4 pins, and near silent operation. I was over the led lights and fan sounds a decade ago and today the only fan sounds i find acceptable come from a gpu. And even then i look for quiet performance.These fans specs are fairly accurate from what i can tell. Only one of them seemed to stop before the advertised min voltage and that was only by like .2v so im not evem going to take a star off. The airflow from them both during silent and full operation is not what i would call impressive. However I would say the amount at silent operation is good (for the rpm) , and at full operation is adequate.No leds to be bright and annoying. Wish they came with rubber mounting grommets but not everyone is sold on them so i get it.",
