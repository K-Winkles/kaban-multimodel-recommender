                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely recommended",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the Anted Prizm 120 ARGB 5 fan pack with controller module. This kit is compatible with many manufacturer LED controllers/programming standards. In my case, I am using an ASUS mobo which uses the 'Aura' environment.Fans/LEDs The fans were easy and straighforward to mount in my case. The LED rings are bright, and the colors match across the other non Antec components in my system, from my LED RAM modules to the built in lighting on the motherboard itself. You'll be pleased at how these look. The fans are quiet, but move adequate air. In this particular build, I'm also using an All-In-One water cooling module and radiator, venting from inside to outside, so it's important that I push cold air into the system. These fans not only conform to the 'Aura' LED programming standard, but the controller module is capable of taking RPM programming input from a Pulsed Wave Modulation output pin. Essentially, your fan speed is dynamically controlled based on the temperature sensors on your CPU. As your CPU gets hotter, the fans speed up, and as the core temp drops, the fans slow down. In all honesty, I had to manually set the fans to run at full speed, in order to see how loud they were, because my CPU never got hot enough for these to ramp up. That said, I could hear the system from across the room, but I have the system in a very echoic room...linoleum floors, not much furniture to absorb the sound. Fan noise is not something that bothers me, as I'm a system engineer by profession, so essentially, even if it's there I don't really hear it. If you're building a system for audio or video production, however, you'll want to make sure you build your system accordingly...large 240 mm fans running at low RPM, and/or water cooling as I've done. Even with water cooling, though, you'll need ambient airflow in your case, and these bad boys will certainly do the trick, and will look fantastic while they're doing it.Controller ModuleThe controller module is slim enough to mount in the cable management section of your case, but if you can't find the room, it's all black and fairly small, so it won't be the showcase of your build. The instructions were a little opaque, but once you spend some time looking back and forth between your mobo manual and the module instructions, things are easy enough to install in the right place. The nice thing is, you don't run any risk of frying anything if you connect the headers to the wrong pins, so you shouldn't worry too much. The one thing you should know going into this is that due to how the control module works, you won't be able to individually program the fans...the same signal and programming gets distributed to all the fans attached to the module. If you want to be able to program fan speeds or LED effects separately, you'll need multiple control modules. That said, I'm more concerned with how the system performs under load than I am having a light show in my case.AccessoriesThe kit came with a double sided foam adhesive square for mounting the control module, and more than long enough cables for a mid-tower sized case. You'll want to get your own zip ties or velcro strips to tie up the wires, but unless you're doing your first build, you'll likely already understand this.Summary The fans move plenty of air, they don't rattle and shake the case to pieces when they are ramped up, and while you can definitely hear them, it's mostly the rushing air you hear, not the fan motors. This noise factor can easily be mitigated by buying larger fans, or by adding water cooling. The LED aspect of the fans matches color well, is nice and bright, and the fans are all controlled and synced by plugging them in to the included controller module. The module supports many industry LED standards, and is compatible with PWM headers on your motherboard. All in all, I consider this a fantastic product at this price point, and I am absolutely happy with it in my build. Unless you have unique requirements, you shouldn't bat an eyelid at buying this kit.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Best bang for buck currently!During this time, finding the fans you want can be a bit of a pita. This is what lead me to look for an alternative. The Antec Prizm fans were exactly what I was looking for but at a fraction of the cost. Construction is sturdy, colors bright and the controlled works as advertised with a cable to connect to your motherboard. Make sure to hold down the \"Mode\" button to connect the controller to the motherboard. I do see some other reviews that are misleading others.1.) No, the 140mm fans are NOT the same size(blade wise) as the 120mm. False!!! I measured both and even visually you can see the difference.2.) For those stating these are loud. They are loud at full speed(1700rpm) and if you ONLY connect the fans to the controller, you will NOT get a PWM signal to control their speed. Once these fans receive a PWM signal from the motherboard their idle noise is almost silent.3.) Daisy-chaining the fans helped consolidate my 9 fans down to 5 ports on the controller. Fans come with daisy-chain connectors. The Controller has great colors and effects. Transitions are smooth. Best part is that it uses SATA for power instead of the classic/old molex connection. Don't hesitate to buy. These are a great alternative if currently you can't find the fans you want or are looking for good, inexpensive fans.Buy with confidence. A++ on construction.***UPDATE***After using the fans for about a month I had both 140mm fans stop spinning(not able to even turnover). Upon further inspection and taking the hub off I saw that the PWM chip's(on the tiny PCB) tolerance is BARELY passable for the hub and rubs after some time in operation. The magnet on the hub is coated with a rubberized material. This is what rubbed against the chip while in operation. Once I cleaned all the debris out, I re-greased the bearing(used Automotive axle grease), installed the hub TWICE,(Install, remove and install again to where it clicks) and now my fans are back to running smooth and good as new. Only writing this because I saw many reviews stating the failures that plague the 140mm fans. THEY CAN BE FIXED! If it happens and you are out of the return window(my situation) you can fix them.",

                "reviewText": "These fans are nice for the price. Provide decent airflow, color rings are good, controller works. However, the controller design is suboptimal. With the number of wires, having wires connect on four sides is exceedingly difficult to manage. Especially if you put 2x5 pack kits in your build. I'm very particular about my wiring and there is just no way to dress these, even in a Lian Li O11 Evo. Fortunately they are hidden, but I still dislike the mess they make. Truthfully, if you need more than 1-5 pack, you would be better served investing in fans that snap together to reduce wiring, I know I will.",
