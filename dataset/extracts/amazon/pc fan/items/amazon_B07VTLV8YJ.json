It wasnt like this with my first set/hub, how annoying. The reset switch doesnt work with the older hub either so i cant reset them both.Very nice and pretty. Easy to install, hub is kinda chunky tho, and the adhesive doesnt always stay stuck in my case. Also when I have rgb color on, at one point in the spiral it looks like red disappears. (Seen in video) Doesnt bother me tho!!!Very nice woosh sound, not a buzzing fan sound. Case is kept very cool and they dont attract much dust.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these fans because I have a 120mm Uphere liquid CPU cooler. These fans do match up well, but I liked them so much I am using them on another build. I am extremely sick and tired of RGB. I cringe every time I see another rainbow technicolor mess. But I do like the ability to change colors to suit my mood. Implementation is key.The fans push alot of air, and the blades are oriented to provide decent static pressure. They include rubber grommets for the corner mounts to reduce vibration. Also there is a decent fan/LED control module, but this thing takes up quite a bit of space. However with this many cables, a hub is a necessity.As far as aesthetics go, they look good if not terribly amazing. The fan hubs are large, which is where the LEDs shine outward. Not my favorite orientation, but it is diffused well with low translucence frosted blades. the color accuracy is above average, with a white color that is not blueish at all. Most RGB devices have a hard time with yellow/orange and the boxed controller is no exception. The fans lent themselves well to motherboard control, both LED and fan speed.And now to the major drawback, and it is not inconsequential. Each fan has 2 cables, the 12V Fan Power and the 3 pin RGB lead. They have mitigated spaghettification by using thin and flat cables. However due to the tiny gauge wires, in my experience they can be easily pinched and broken through normal cable management. Be careful!Some other fan manufacturers have come up with ingenious designs to daisy chain multiple fans without all the wire mess. Of course those fans carry a price premium. But I believe eventually any RGB fan multipacks will include some way to minimize cables. So for now, this is a good budget option. Just be aware that many thin cables are in your future.

                "reviewText": "This was an easy install of 4/5 fans, the 5th fan I need longer fan screws to use than cane in the package. The package contained 5 fans, and new short screws, and a hub controller. The Instructions are terrible but you can figure them out if you\u2019re familiar with motherboard setups. Just be sure not to use the 12V RBG and use the 5V one.I had other LED lights in my case and I was able to remove them and this helped on cable management as well. I went from 2 to 4 fans currently but will add the 5th one soon.This will help with the other upgrades and heat from the new GPU. I would recommend this setup at this price.Update: I got all 5 fans in the case and they are running great. The red, really matches the Red on my Red Devil GPU and makes the entire setup look menacing. The only thing I have noticed because this is all daisy chained together into a hub your bios doesn\u2019t track but 1 can speed as only 1 fan port is used on the Motherboard. But they do a great job of helping to keep case temps down.",
