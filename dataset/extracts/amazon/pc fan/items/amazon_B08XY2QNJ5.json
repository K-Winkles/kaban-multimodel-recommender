                "reviewText": "This kit was purchased to double the number of intake fans on a white Corsair 5000X RGB glass case. They match the included set of three fans and plug into the included Fan/RGB nodes inside the case's wiring panel. These do not have fancy bearings or even rubber pads at contact points, they're just quiet iCUE RGB fans. These white fans have black mounting screws....and managing two wires per fan was a small irritation even with a case that has good wire management. They require iCUE controllers and software to light up properly, and the controller needs a USB header on the motherboard to plug into. Default colors before software installation were saturated and walked in rings from fan to fan, default colors after installation (in my case) were white at boot and then walking the rings once Windows loaded but the new default colors were far less intense. iCUE has extensive controls to control the lights.Fan performance is only adequate with a focus more on quietness than airflow. With six intakes, one 120mm rear exhaust and a top-exhausting AIO, I needed the six SP120s running at or above 60% to prevent the case heating up during a GPU-only stress test. Inside the glass case they are still extremely quiet, and not especially loud even at 100% fan speed. Always perform a GPU-only case heating test to ensure your CPU cooler (especially an AIO or other radiator) is supplied with cool air at all times. If you don't do this, it is possible that your case will heat up running certain games or professional workloads., and it could shorten the life of components especially any liquid cooling.For practical usage and for a setup with fewer fans buyers may want something that has a higher maximum rotation speed (RPM) and a higher airflow rating (CFM). For mounting fans on a radiator you may need more Static Pressure rather than pure CFM, it's a little complicated. Corsair ML fans have magnetic bearings and I consider them superior to these overall, there are also popular brands like Noctua, Cooler Master, Be Quiet!, and many others. A lot of fans from the same maker look almost the same so pay attention to the actual speed/airflow/noise ratings and check the reviews.And seriously unless you are planning for RGB from the start, just get fans with a single wire each and no extra control boxes. You can also attach one of your intake fans to your GPU if it has a PWM fan port, this would lower the risk of case heating under GPU-only loads. Play it safe and take the time to ask questions when building or upgrading for the first time.",

These bad boys are not prethreaded so you have to use a lot of elbow grease. Other than that, the cables were all white, everything fit perfectly. The iCue software was super easy to work with. If it wasn\u2019t for the threading being needed, I\u2019d give it 10/10 lol the cable management is just something you\u2019ll have to learn to fix at your own gusto. Id recommend invest in some Velcro straps-easy to install-very quiet-easy to use software-easy to connect-cons very rough to thread the new fans.",

BUT...BUT.. they are SUCH GOOD FANS!I had bought a Kraken X73 to plug on the top of my case, but my experience was not as fun as I expected. Their fans (NZXT) are SO noisy that I needed something quieter. I knew Corsair were almost silent but packed a punch with their cooling advantages, so I splurge with the money. I have 3 NZXT fans to sell if anyone wants them, haha.Now my computer is almost silent with (for the moment) 6 fans running wild and I almost don't hear them. Temperature wise, I am running a Ryzen Threadripper and the running temp as gone down almost 20\u00b0C on average.I would def' recommend!",
