When the fan is constantly ramping up and down and the knob is in the right spot it will go from 50% to 100% over and over and over again.It\u2019s an emergency backup, because it CAN control speed. There\u2019s just no way to dial it in that I can see.",

Not a big deal since I only needed 2 headers anyway. Horrible bright red led on the board that serves no purpose. Plugging 2 fans into a single channel (there are 4 channels on the board, each with 2 headers) appears to halve the power each fan gets, so really only good for 4 total fans. Speed control isn't very granular, seems to only be off, half, full. Otherwise it works well enough for what I wanted it for.",
