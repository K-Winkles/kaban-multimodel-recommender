And since I didn't want to repeat this process any time soon, I figured on replacing all of them at once.Wasn't expecting much for the price, but these fans were pretty quiet. And not a surprise, they don't seem to move a lot of air, but with a large PS fan, a good sized heat sink fan, and these new fans as well, my very overcrowded tower case seemed in good shape, and WAY less noisy than before. However, as I was buttoning up the case, I moved one of the new fan's power leads a bit, so it wouldn't get pinched, and got a large Snap of an electrical arc, followed by total silence. I blew my power supply.In looking into the issue, I realized that each of these new fans has both the 3-pin connector and a 4-pin Molex connector. That's good. However, the Molex connector is 2 sided. It has both male and female pins. So whichever type you use, there are exposed pins on the unused side. One of these exposed pins found something to connect to and cost me a new power supply. At the minimum. Just ordered one. Not a happy customer, but I assure you, I will tape the living hell out of those unused, exposed fan connectors when I rebuild it. At least a full day of un-needed headaches, if the thing even wakes up again, and another $75 for a new P/S, all for some budget fans.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a bunch of fans (Cooler Master 140mm, Rosewill 120mm, APEVIA AF58S-BK 80mm, and Arctic F8 80mm) to see which ones would give me the best airflow, and by FAR the Arctic F8 80mm fan *blew them all out of the water.*I was surprised despite similar design and larger size of other fans. I'm using them for hobby purposes and don't care as much about sound, but they were all pretty quiet (probably proportional with the amount of air they were moving (meaning the Arctic was louder at 12V, but the Arctic at 5V, was as quiet and moving as much air as the others at 12V).I know that it wasn't a super scientific test and they weren't even the same size, but it wasn't even close. Really surprised me actually.",
