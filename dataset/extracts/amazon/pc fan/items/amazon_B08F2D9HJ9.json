These are a great value, I got three fans and a hub controller for less than other packs that come without a controller.ARGB: My Mobo does not have an ARGB header so I'm able to have argb with the controller, there are many solid colors and combinations. the white on full brightness looks a little more yellow than when on lower brightness but it's not a big deal to me.NOISE: Not bad at all, no rattling and very quiet. I only noticed the air through the fans when on much higher RPMs but i don't mind that sound at all.FAN SPEEDS: I noticed that the product picture of controller showing to plug one fan on port 7 for PWM control is incorrect as I plugged mine on the white slot which is port 12 and the others on 11, 10 and so forth. I plugged the PWM cable to my Mobo 4pin sys fan 1 header and I can control speeds by temp.Overall, very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I like the fans. They look nice and are relatively quiet, the noise level would be better if PWM worked but the included controller, while being able to fit on a 4 pin PWM connector on the motherboard, cannot be controlled by the motherboards BIOS. In fact, the fans while spinning do not show in the bios at all. The controller on the Vetroo case I was using previously could be used with PWM. Needless to say, this aspect of the fans is disappointing, since I now have to purchase a controller, adding more cost to my build. Maybe for the price point, adding an extra wire is too much to ask",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased the Montech Sky One Lite case which had two intake fans and one exhaust in the rear. I initially ordered one Vetroo RGB fan to add on the top for exhaust. Afterwards, I decided to convert all the case fans to RGB and ordered four more Vetroo fans. I replaced all the Montech fans with Vetroo fans and I'm happy with the result. My current build includes 3 intake in the front and two exhaust fans.The air flow from the fans is good and the RGB is sufficient for my purposes. I certainly didn't want to go down the RGB rabbit hole with software that could cause conflicts, so I just used the remote to cycle through the variety of effects, finally settling on orange to match the case LEDs. The orange looks a little pinkish in the video but not when viewed live. The fans can display a variety of colors.My new build is an i7 13700k with RX6750xt graphics card, all white DeepCool AK620 and a Gigabyte Z790 motherboard. I have included the Corsair 32 GB RGB ram kit to finalize the build.",

For the money spent I'm really happy with the checkboxs these checked and can live with the ones they didn't... These are not proprietary, meaning they have a 4 pin connector for fans and 5v 3 pin led connector, each fans led connectors also has a pig tall son you could in theory daisy Cain them all from one led connector or you can just use them via the hub with sata power. Even thought connected to the fan header I can not control or see them in bios and they are a little loud. They do move alot of airEdit 04/11/2022: I have also used the white ones and quality is consistent. I did want to add that I almost didn't purchase them because of the grey shock absorbers on the corners that they are advertised with, I wasn't digging the grey for my color scheme, but these came with white and I like that. But they should consider properly displaying the product as I almost passed them by because of it.",

Installed all six in the case, then wired to the included single fan hub which was double sided taped to the back of the Cooler Master TD500 case. Fitment was not an issue with the rear cover door. Connected the single PWM 4-pin fan connector to the Gigabyte B450 AORUS M motherboard, then the SATA to the EVGA power supply connector for power. Gigabyte's AORUS has built-in RGB control from within the BIOS so no software was required to select different RGB themes. Tested the supplied Vetroo remote and it also can control the RGB lighting as well. Comparing these to my experience with Corsair SP120 fans, I was surprised that they performed nearly as well, but at less than half the price. Note: to have full PWM control, then use a fan splitter instead of the hub.",

I'm using them with an MSI motherboard and no issues with the light effects through Dragon Centre. The only issue is with the included fan hub. Works fine for argb but nothing for pwm.Found out after the fact trying to use PWM using the hub is useless as the pwm part doesn't get enough current so it isn't detected. PWM directly from fan to mobo works as it should but I now have to buy fan splitters because I don't have enough system fan headers. The included controller doesn't provide enough control for fan speed. Without PWM the default has them going full tilt. Loud like an aircraft carrier. Vetroo needs to improve their fan hubs so buyers can get full functionality without spending more money.",
