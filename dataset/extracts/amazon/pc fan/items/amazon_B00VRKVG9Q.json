                "reviewText": "The primary exhaust fan on my Linux gaming tower was on the verge of failing. This Thermaltake fan had both the low decibel rating I wanted as well as better level of airflow compared to the original unit.The fan exceeds my expectations. It was very easy to install. The four screw holes contain vibration dampeners, which I find to be a very nice touch. It is remarkably quiet (I have seven fan installed in the tower box) and the air flow is prodigious. The fan\u2019s price was much less than I was thinking I\u2019d have to pay for the quality.The lighted blue ring is a nice touch, although, since the fan is located on the rear side of the machine, it\u2019s not really that visible. So far I have nothing negative to say about this very well designed Thermaltake fan",

                "reviewText": "I have bought the both the riing 12 and 14 models. These are fantastic fans. With regards to the riing 14 models I have bought multiple of these fans over the last few years. They are very reliable and even my older ones are still functioning quietly and efficently. There are few things one should note before using these though.-These fans are more or less meant for being case only fans (I'm sure they would function fine as radiators for AIOs but they are still only 3 pin fans)-They are high static pressure so they are able to punch through a decent amount of filters with little to no issuesWith those things out of the way it is time to get into the bulk of my review and into my thoughts about these fans after using them for about 5 or so years. The first thing I noticed about these fans is that at 100% they are decently noisy, but this is fairly unsurprising given their size. However, this is where some of you might be worried to buy them. Don't less this dissuade you from buying these fantastic fans. Even at 80% power these fan pump out an absolutely tremendous amount of air (borderline ridiculous amount) and at 80% they are nearly silent. My solution to the noise was simply taking them from my molex powered fan hub and plugging them into a fan header and the default curve took care of the rest (Brought it down from 100% power and a fair amount of noise to 65% and perfectly silent). Alternatively you can also use the low-noise adapter when plugging it into a hub but you will have to make sure to place it somewhere where heat (55C was what I was seeing with my probe) doesn't have the potential to harm your system. The final thing I would like to comment on is that these fans have very nicely lengthed cables so there is no need for extension cables even on the most large of builds.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love the Riing series fans from Thermaltake. I originally purchased a blue one from Best Buy as an emergency replacement. I was greatly surprised at the design and look of this fan once installed. Sturdy construction, braided cable with molex power adapter and the \"quiet cable\" or whatever it is. I originally installed the fan with the quite cable attached, knowing only that it was supposed to limit the RPM of the fan, to keep it quite when on. Welp, idk if it is my motherboard or what but, with the quite cable connected, the LED light on the fan would come on but the fan would not spin. Took the quite cable off and the fan works beautifully. I loved the look of the fan so much that I decided to order a second one to replace the stock blue LED fan that came with my case. The Thermaltake fan looked so nice and the stock fan looked terrible next to it.Pros--Even at 1200 RPM, these fans are quiet.-The halo lighting around the fan looks 1000x better than the stand LED fans where you can see each of the 4 LED's shinning on the fan blades.-They provide enough lighting but aren't so bright that they light up your whole room when the lights are off.-They move a lot of air! and do so rather efficiently.-Rubber pads around corners means no vibration noises or rattling of anything.Cons--None really, other than the quite cable didn't work but that didn't bother me as the fans aren't loud enough for me to care.",

                "reviewText": "I bought both the Red and Yellow versions, hoping for a subtle and stylish single-color ring. However, the LEDs' brightness is lower than expected, resulting in an underwhelming effect. While the ring is visible, it doesn't illuminate the other components well. Additionally, the two units installed in the front and top panels of my case are nearly invisible through the mesh panel.Note: The LEDs appear brighter in the picture than they actually are in real life. But you can still see the front panels fan LEDs are quite dim looking. The GPU led is quite bright and noticable, and even appears to glow onto the components above it. Can't say the same for the other LEDs despite how the pictures makes some of them look.",

At 100% load you may notice them, but they also include a resistor to reduce the fan speed (I assume to around 1200RPM or so). You just connect it between the fan and the molex connector the PWM slot on your motherboard.They come with 2 different sets of screws which is actually what I needed. They come with the long screws for front case mounting and the small threaded screws like most regular fans do.The LED ring is fairly bright, but maybe could be a bit brighter if I was being picky. Good amount of air pushed vs. my old case fans and they run a bit quieter too.",
