                "reviewText": "Was going to give 3 stars but the quality is there. Reason would been from no control over the led lighting. For the price it's understandable and low cost so 4 stars. Sorry I was going to put my personal feelings in it and the reviewsshould not and only be on the product. Ok with that. The quality is on the light side where most fans seem to be made more durable in a way. This fan is made on the light side for weight I guess. It's not like hard plastic and seems that is anything interrupted the spinning a blade just might come off. Good thing packs are in 3 and most pc will use 2 of theses and a few of smaller ones. Having the plugs connect together is a cool way to power all of them at once just leaves wire in the open and harder to hide. Still not a bad thing. The fans when working are found to be quiet. Not sure what kind of bearings they use or if they are oil soaked bushings. Will be back to say when one gives out. Installing them is just like any other fan. Few screws and a plug. The appearance of the fan is actually pleasing. Just can't get the leds to match what the case does with the controllable lights that are themed in the case and memory and on the motherboard with other ones too so they kind of stand out. The do move air when they are on and should be the main thing here. They do have some noise just because they are not controlled so either on or off are the only options where my others are controlled be the motherboard on speed variation. Anyways for the price it's not bad at all.",

                "reviewText": "For the price these are pretty Good. The only issues that other should know about is that the RGB on this depends on the fan speed. If you plug it in via the 3 pin connector, you'll notice that the RGB turns on immediately at boot but then shuts down while the fan is still spinning. In order to fix this, assuming you want the RGB all the time is to go into the bios and change the fan speed to either full speed for the full, brightest RGB or change it to performance mode for full, but relatively dull RGB. Anything under that will not light up the full fan, silent mode will not light up the fans at all.Of course you can just leave it as it is and the fans will automatically pick up speed based on the Motherboard or CPU temperatures, whatever you set it at. Or skip all this and connect the fans via the molex straight into the PSU which will run the fan at full speed right from the get go. However this might raise the noise level.Personally left it at performance mode for full but slightly dim RGB and almost no extra noise.",
