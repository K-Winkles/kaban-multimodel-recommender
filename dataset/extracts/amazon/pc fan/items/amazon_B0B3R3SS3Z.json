I put 5 in my nzxt h5 flow (3 intake, 2 exhaust). I also added them to the deepcool Ak400 Zero dark plus in a push/pull config, and they keep my 5800x3d just as cool as a 240mm AIO would. First pic is with a 5600x, but i swapped it out for a 5800x3d about a week after. My whole setup together with these fans, and this case, and 3080 at full load, in a game, doesn't go over 70c, and the 5800x3d, sits right around 65c, at 1440p. I've had pretty much every fan, from corsair, to noctua, and nzxt. For the price to performance, these beat them all, and remain nearly silent while doing so.",

                "reviewText": "I recently built a new PC and purchased a case that included 3 fans on the front and one on the rear. After I had built the PC, I discovered that the fans in the case were actually relatively weak, with the front fans only rated for about 1200 RPM. Since I was going to replace the front fans with some rather powerful 2100 RPM fans, I figured I should put some fans that were almost as powerful along the top for venting to reach a near-neutral pressure inside the case when keeping the rear fan the same. I went with these fans from DeepCool due to their RPM and CFM ratings, and I don't regret it. I can hear the fans when they reach their max RPM, but it's only the sound of air moving, nowhere near the noise level of other fans that sound like jet engines. They do a great job of venting air from my case and, when combined with my cpu cooler and front fans, they keep my i7-13700K cpu in the range of 50-60 degrees Celsius under heavy load. The fans come with a magnetic fan hub to attach inside the case that allows you to power up to 4 fans off of only 1 chassis fan header on the motherboard, making installation and cable management somewhat easier. Something worth mentioning is that these fans are the exact same as the stock fans for the DeepCool AK620 Digital cpu cooler. Like I said, these are great fans, but beware Amazon drivers who don't care. I had to send my first set of fans back because the product packaging was not protected by anything like bubble wrap or foam, and the fans arrived damaged from being thrown around. For the second set that they sent me, they apparently learned their lesson and at least put the product in a bubble mailer. This, of course, has nothing to do with the manufacturer and everything to do with Amazon not thinking when packaging a product.",

No panel frontal perforado ni cristal.La temperatura fue medida con la app NZXT y HWMonitor.Temperatura normal 45-47, carga normal 54-57 y con cargar 66 no sube ni siquiera a 70.La carga es con edici\u00f3n 4k y juegos AAA en ultra 4k.Anteriormente tenia 3 Ventiladores en el Enfriador y llegaba a la misma temperatura, ahora con solo 2 hace la misma funci\u00f3n.Coloque el 3er Ventilador a la PSU (fuente de poder) y las temperaturas mejoraron extraordinariamente, antes se apagaba por calentamiento y el PSU estaba muy caliente pero ahora esta fresco.Y lo MALO, es que solamente uno llego con falso en cable, necesito hacer presi\u00f3n para que embone con el conector a PC. Siempre qu\u00e9 limpio tengo problemas con el cable qu\u00e9 hace falso, \"No es mi MOBO ni el accesorio que incluye\".Me molesta porque Por la caja que viene abierta y maltratada, creo que ser\u00eda porque revisan los Ventiladores antes de enviarlos pero es al contrario.",
