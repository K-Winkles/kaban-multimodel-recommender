Bought them because I was too lazy to clean my old ones and didn\u2019t want to pay the extortion-level fees of a Corsair. Worth the money if your primary goal is moving air through your system efficiently.",

                "reviewText": "These fans cannot be beat for the price. They provide more than adequate cooling, and look great. My only minor complaints are that the lighting is very centralized, it doesn\u2019t diffuse to cover the fan blades well. They also cause slight vibration of my case/desk at high speeds, though the cooling they offer at lower speeds is plenty for my 4070. Finally they will sometimes switch color profiles randomly, though this could be caused by one of my neighbors using an RGB/LED controller.Overall I would absolutely suggest this product, it is a great budget set of RGB case fans with minor issues.",

Only issue I had is that one of the fans makes a slightly noticeable clicking noise at the highest speed but at medium they are fine. If I had paid more I would have returned but the time to remove them all and replace isn\u2019t worth the effort. Wish I could replace just the one.Update: I decide to reach out to the seller regarding the one fan that was making a clicking sound. All I can say is their customer service is outstanding and they resolved my issue! They get an grade of A+!",

The fans stay bright white and spin full blast. If there was once a control on it, I might be able to switch modes, as the advertisement promised, but no , just a hole in the which states \"key\". But no key. Just a hole. No sweat was going to hook it to mystic on the MB or so a sane man would think... Yet that only worked for 36 hours and the fans turned bright white. To send them back, my machine is down. So what am I to do? Is bright white and full blast my future?I got a replacement today. LO and Behold, upon opening the box, there was a remote control. This was not in the 1st box sent. It makes a world of difference.",
