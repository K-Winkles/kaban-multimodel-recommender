Temps are low, fan noise is minimal, and the halo ring RGB looks really nice. The only reason i\u2019m giving these 4/5 stars is my motherboard doesn\u2019t support ARGB, only RGB, so I haven\u2019t been able to test out all of the ARGB features. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re amazing but I cannot vouch. However, i truly do recommend these if you want good price to performance, and value aesthetics.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised by the quality of these fans, they look awesome in my Corsair 4000D Airflow case and provide tons of airflow all while not sounding like a jet engine. They are completely silent below 1000 RPM (I personally keep them around 800 RPM) and I honestly cannot hear them even when the room is completely silent and sitting about a meter away from the tower, the only noise I hear comes from the AMD stock CPU cooler, but I ordered a better CPU cooler. The daisy chain system is awesome, I'm only using a single sysfan header and a single argb header for the 3 fans. Controlling the RGB with MSI Center is easy and straightforward. I would 100% recommend them for anyone looking for sleek looks, great airflow and silent operation. For 4000D Airflow owners especially, these are completely silent compared to the stock fans.",

                "reviewText": "I think these fans look great! I bought additional 1.5 inch round all black stickers to go over the fans label, gave it a nice stealth look.They perform well and are quiet.I unfortunately did get 1 dead fan, lights worked, but not the fan. They are so cheap, I just bought another one.After watching many videos on youtube, I know Thermalright has the best cheap fans.They have 15 LEDs per fan, and each is addressable in OpenRGB, which I like for now.there are a TON of wires. 2 per fan, then they split so you can daisy chain them, which makes it 4 connectors per fan, it's kind of difficult to manage, but it's a nice feature compared to splitters.",

                "reviewText": "I've been almost exclusively using thermalright fans in my build for a while now, so when I saw that they released some ring-light style fans, I had to pick them up. There's really not much to say, they're some of the quietest fans I've used and I personally really like how they look. I also appreciate how both the fan and rgb connectors are daisy-chainable. I actually only use a single rgb header for all of the fans in my case because of that. My temps are fine so they probably move a decent amount of air. I have a very high end build but I just can't see myself spending hundreds of dollars on fans when these do everything I could ever ask for, for $5 a fan.",
