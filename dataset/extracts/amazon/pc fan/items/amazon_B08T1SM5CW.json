For 20$ i really can't complain too much about it. The controller works just fine but you do have to be someone's close to the case for the hub to pick up the signal.I'm sure people would like a more customizable lighting array but I don't use rainbow or anything like that, just one solid color so it works good for my builds.It has a magnetic back to the hub and it's definitely strong enough. Also cool that the hub itself has built in rgb which I didn't know when I bought it.All in all, I'd recommend it for a budget option if you need a 4pin fan and 5v argb hub with controller.",

                "reviewText": "I use this as an argb 3 pin controller. My case has a fan/argb hub and also a controller built in, but i have 8 argb fans running and don't want to overload the motherboard connection and the MSI bios has no argb control, nor do I want to use the case controller which requires installing Cooler masters software.I just want a controller to display a static color and requires no software and also one with enough channels where I don't have to use a splitter plugging 2 or more devices into a single channel.With this I can plug each individual argb connection into the controller which doesn't over load the system (no dimming lights when using too many argb devices on a single splitter).I don't plug my fans into this controller, I just plug the fan argb connection into the controller and that is all, no connection to the motherboard.The remote works fine. The controller is behind a steel plate in my case which covers the wiring and of course, the side of the case, so the controller is behind two pieces of metal and the remote works fine from 5 feet away. All buttons work.The only thing I wish this had was a mode for the static colors, like pulse or swirl, I think this is a miss.I bought this because I didn't want to use software to control the argb and also because the mother board bios didn't have any argb control, so while the case hub was fine, when turning on the PC, the argb defaults to rainbow flashing, but with no way to change it.With this I have it set for a static color, no software and the device works really well, its solid.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Powered via SATA, not Molex.- Remote works.- 12 solid colors to choose from, you're unlikely to not find something for your build.- Magnet works well.- The unit itself has RGB, it's bright enough that you almost don't notice the hideous \"Cool moon\" logo.Cons:- I ordered black and received white. It was stickered as black at the warehouse. If you read through the reviews this has happened quite a bit with this brand, so maybe order a couple or be prepared to return/exchange.- It's quite a bit taller than I was expecting and may have trouble fitting in between the case and side panel or 2.5\" drive slot.- The flashy color modes are completely useless except for the default RGB puke. No color themes (purple and blue, orange and teal, etc) or single color with effects possible without software handling it.- All or nothing on colors, you can't control individual channels via the remote despite it having multiple ports.Bottom line: If you just want a single solid color changeable via a remote and no bloatware/spyware, this is basically your only option so long as you have room in your case. Buy multiple if you're worried about getting the wrong color. If you want custom effects and software control, go with a Razer Chroma Controller or invest in Corsair's system.",

Arrived on time and i like the original packaging, keeps the product secured.The Coolmon is a snow white shade of color, i have it located in the case back panel, it is a ARGB Hub, the with over 100 colors, very virbrant and bright, can be dimmed via controlling.The PMW features a argb connection and also multiple slots for fans and ARGB, the link system is simple to install, which i love.I own a Cooler Master TD500 ATX case and Thermalright ARGB Water cooling fans, also every LED you see is from COOLMON (Thats the brand of the Hub you're gonna buy)I suggest you get their products for its capability and compatibility are numerous.It can do what my COOLER MASTER CASE couldn't do, which is Switch colors at a push of a button. Which my Case has but lacks in functionality.Conclusion, if you meed a hub for extra fan slots and argb support, THIS IS THE HUB FOR YOU.It has a slot for reset cable so you can turn your case reset button into a ARGB led button.I reccomend. And thank you Coolmon",
