The materials don\u2019t feel super high quality, but for the price that was pretty much expected. Overall, the device works as intended and I haven\u2019t had any issues with it so far.

                "reviewText": "First, you should know this thing works fine. Takes 1 SATA power cable and includes an RGB cable to go from RGB header to device. Strangely the input port is not marked but, 12v goes on the left just like all the other ports.What I discovered *after* I bought this was I don't need it. It never occurred to me to look up how many amps my fans use on rgb, and that the average RGB head is doing 3 amps.My fans (7 of arctic p14 RGB) only use 0.2A each on RGB. So I could fairly easily fit 10+ fans off that one header (7 * 0.2 = 1.4A.. so even 14 fans would be 2.8A). Arctics website shows the power draw for both fan and RGB. I'm not sure about other manufacturers but I'd assume they'll have it listed too.Lastly, it's just a little thick, too thick to put between my side panel and backplate. So I had to stuff it inside a hard drive cage and meh. It just bugs me.I'll probably just get an RGB splitter cable to make cable management a little easier and remove this device. But it does work great if you need something like this!",
