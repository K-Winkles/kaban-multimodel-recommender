I read a review complaining about the flimsiness around the pins, but this is a very inexpensive product so you get what you pay for. The cord has a breaded cover which adds to your pc. Overall I have no complaints about this power supply hub, it would be nice if they added a small plastic housing around the pins. If you use the adhesive to stick them somewhere in your case then you'll be alright and wont risk bending the pins. 5 stars due to pricing mainly",

It worked well for the time being, about a day after I peeled the film off of it and stuck it onto my case it came loose and fell off. While I was re-routing it to his it in my case one of the wires broke right off on the board, rendering it useless. I would say it is amazing for the price and definitely does the job well, but it does has some cons that I have just said.",
