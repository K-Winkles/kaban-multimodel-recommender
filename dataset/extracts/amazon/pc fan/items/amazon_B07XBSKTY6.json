                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Super pleased with the quality, noise level, airflow, and lighting, especially for the low price!",
                "reviewText": "**I'll list pros and cons at the bottom if you don't want to read through**I really didn't expect a whole lot from a pack of 6 RGB fans for $50, but I have to say I love these things! After looking at a ton of different RGB fan sets, I decided on these for the cost, looks, AND they were the only ones with a fan controller that i haven't seen a single review about wires shorting or a fire starting.Unboxing them I could immediately tell they felt pretty beefy. Thick plastic, no flex or blade wobble. The fan controller feels paper light, which is usually a concern, but it's been working perfectly so far.It was easy to install everything, the included screws didn't feel difficult to screw into the fans, the double sided tape on the controller is strong, and there is plenty of wire length for even larger cases.Everything worked without a hitch. The colors and effects are absolutely beautiful, the transitions are super smooth and the colors are vivid, you can also adjust the effects speeds. The remote is very basic, and can take a bit to scroll through the effect options, but it's working perfect. Airflow is really good, and noise levels are surprisingly low. You can use the controller to set the speed to low, mid, and high, and all are pretty quiet. I haven't come across any bugs in the way everything works. And as a huge plus, these do keep your settings after powering off, or unplugging, some of the inexpensive sets don't.I don't really like the proprietary fan plugs, if the fan controller dies, you cant use the fans on anything else that i'm aware of, and I don't think any other fans would work with the controller either. There's also no PWM for controlling the fan speed, it all has to be done with the supplied remote. There's an ARGB header on the controller to sync with your motherboard, but I can't test due to lack of a header on my rig. The fan controller is SATA powered VS molex, which is nice and seems a bit safer thank the molex horror stories i've seen on other units. Even the stickers on the fan blades hubs are installed well, they don't have an annoying wobbly look that some fan decals have when they are applied wrong.In short, i'm pretty blown away with the value here, if I get even a year out of these I'll be really happy.PROS- Solid feeling build quality- Beautiful vivid RGB colors and cool effects- Tons of nice effects- Easy set up- Everything working and no bugs (so far)- 6 fans and a controller for $50!- Great airflow and quiet, nice blade design- SATA power instead of molex- Can hook 10 fans and 2 LED strips to the controller (though proprietary)- Can confirm the fans work good on a radiator- Good wire length- Saves setting on power off and unplugged- Full coverage RGB, has rings on the front, back and sides, and the blades are litCONS- Proprietary fan plugs- No PWM for speed control- If the remote were to break or get lost, there's no alternate way to change colors and effects unless you're using everything synced with your motherboard, and you wouldn't be able to change fan speeds.- Basic remote, works fine but takes ages to cycle through all the effects- Doesn't seem like you can control brightness unless you use a solid color- All fans run the same speed at all times. Would be cool to be able to control different fans speeds separately, like faster or slower speeds for intake or exhaustTime will tell how they hold up, but so far so good! Will update if anything changes.",

                "reviewText": "Great airflow, near silent on medium fan setting, beautiful rbg, and one of the only 6 pack kits you can buy online. My case holds 6 fans. For $50 dollars, I cannot complain. Build quality is okay, but be easy with it when installing. The cables are not going to handle any excessive force. The 3m tape for the controller does not stick on my metal case. It comes right off. I used some stronger tape that I had on hand.The fans come with a year warranty and this company actually makes a decent chunk of pc mods. Check out their website. How long will the fans last? That is the question. My recommendation would be to wait a month and see what you think of them. If you like them then by a spare kit to keep long term. These use proprietary connectors and fan controller. If it fails you will need another of the exact same, but can't complain for the price. They do sell an arbg fan set instead of the proprietary connector on their website. That way you can change out with any fan model technically. I didn't buy that one because it comes in a 5 fan kit.I've got everything paired to my arbg fan header on my motherboard. I've only got one fan header so had to use an arbg splitter to get my cpu fans and case rbg sync'd up. Works great. Some might consider it a con that you need the remote to set the fan speed. I prefer having a turn dial in my case like the old days, but get some velcro tape and stick the remote to your case. Problem solved. Most people set their fan curve to one setting and never touch them again. Put it on medium and forget about it.I'll do an update later on if I have any issues.",

                "reviewText": "These are some really nice looking white rgb fans.Pros:Good vibrancy on all the rings, even when set for for intake.Good, solid build quality.Easy to hook up with the included hub.Wires are a good length.Led strip port works with my waterblock.Quiet.Very reasonable price for 6 fans.Remote works wonders without an 5V rgb hub. I have it hooked up to one, and it went to the right color right away through the motherboards software.Cons:Modest air flow, but it states it on the fact sheet, but it works enough.Definitely not a radiator fan. I have noctua 12x25s behind the radiator.Only does a light blue and bright green, but the other colors pop.I decided to take a chance on these when going for a light build and decided to change out noctuas and silent wing 3s from a dark build.I'm happy I chose these fans. They look great, move enough air, and fit in perfectly. Their NVME heatsinks are really good and come in a variety of colors.This is after 2 days of long use, and will update if anything changes.",
