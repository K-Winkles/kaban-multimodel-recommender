Various state-of-the-art technologies and a record tight tip clearance of only 0.5mm, which is made possible by using the novel Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer material, allow it to achieve superb results in all types of usage: Whether it\u2019s in low-impedance, airflow-oriented applications such as case cooling, or high-impedance, pressure-demanding scenarios such as on heatsinks and watercooling radiators, the NF-A12x25 is a proven winner. The chromax.black.swap edition combines the NF-A12x25\u2019s signature quiet cooling performance with an attractive black design and a bundle of swappable red, white, blue, green, grey, yellow and black anti-vibration pads that allow the colour-customisation of the fan to match individual build colour schemes. For further customisation, a wide range of accessories such as coloured cables and anti-vibration mounts are available separately. Topped off with Noctua\u2019s trusted premium-grade SSO2 bearing and more than 150,000 hours MTTF, the NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.black.swap is the perfect choice for all users who value individual, focused build aesthetics just as much as class-leading quality and performance.",

This makes them ideal for enthusiasts looking for true premium-grade fans that can be colour-coordinated with popular build themes such as all black, black & white or black & red. Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer compound The NF-A12x25\u2019s impeller is made from Noctua\u2019s novel Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) compound that features extreme tensile strength, an exceptionally low thermal expansion coefficient and damping characteristics that are ideal for reducing resonance and vibration phenomena in advanced fan-blade designs. Ultra-tight tip clearance The NF-A12x25 has a record tight tip clearance (distance between the blade tips and the inside of the frame) of only 0.5mm. This highly ambitious design sets a new benchmark for 120mm fans and helps the NF-A12x25 to work more efficiently against back pressure, such as on heatsinks or radiators, by reducing leak flows through the gap between impeller and frame. Swappable anti-vibration pads in 7 colours The NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.black.swap comes with 4 white, red, blue, green, grey, yellow and black NA-AVP1 anti-vibration pads. By combining the various colours with black or going all black using the supplied NA-AVG1 anti-vibration gasket, the fan can be coordinated with most popular build colour schemes out of the box. Additional NA-SAVP1 sets for outfitting both sides in one colour can be purchased separately.",

                "reviewText": "These fans are really good, they are extremely quiet, can pull alot of air at low speeds and they remain quiet even at 80% speed which is around 1850-1900 RPM if I remember correctly. Only two problems about this fan is they're a little pricey and the cable is a bit too short and that can be a problem when building in larger cases which is my second complaint because you have to spend more to get an extended cable for it but overall everything else about this product is incredible. I would definitely recommend someone these fans because they are what you would call high-performance fans and they are worth every penny just keep in mind of the its 30 dollar price tag and its short PMW cable",

                "reviewText": "I stuck with Noctua fans for my Intel NUC, and it handles the tight compact case for a Canyon with an i9 and a 3060 in it, so I replaced more fans in a different PC with these as case fans.The case has an acrylic side panel, and otherwise doesn\u2019t have amazing airflow. These fans? Even with a bit of crowded cables in their way, the noise and cooling is far superior to the older fans that had been in there for some 6+ years.They\u2019re very versatile, and don\u2019t sound any more loud than someone quietly talking, so streaming with these even running at a pretty decent speed, you\u2019d never hear them on your mic.Even running demanding games, streaming, with RTX shader settings at high; these fans really haven\u2019t kicked up to a point where I could hear them clearly from several feet away. I really don\u2019t hear them; I head the GPU fans.That\u2019s the common thing honestly running Noctua fans in your PC cases for airflow; you don\u2019t hear them much or at all, you instead hear every other fan. You\u2019ll hear your AIO fans on the radiator, or your GPU fans, but not the case fans. That\u2019s probably the best problem to have, though, because they aren\u2019t having to run to a point where they\u2019re at full blast anyway. The PCs cool enough the temps are well below 70-80\u00b0C even with a heater running (it\u2019s winter currently).TLDR; get these fans, so you don\u2019t hear them. They work. Just get them.",

In terms of design, they are all black which is fits the color scheme of most PC builds. My main issue with this fan is the price and extras. At 45$, it cost 8$ over the original one. It doesn't come with a short extension and a splitter as well. Instead, you get more anti vibration feets and one long extension cable.For pure airflow and low noise level, these are probably the best fans on the market in terms of performance and looks. If you want Chromax fans for a radiator or to pass air through a mesh filter, the NF-F12 is a better option in terms of price.Overall, this is the best of the best in terms of performance, but you still expect more in the box given the price premium.",

Obwohl der Preis etwas h\u00f6her ist als bei anderen Herstellern, rechtfertigt die beeindruckende Leistung des L\u00fcfters diesen Aufpreis voll und ganz.Die K\u00fchlleistung des NF-A12x25 PWM ist bemerkenswert. Selbst unter starker Belastung bleibt die Temperatur im Desktop-System auf einem erstaunlich niedrigen Niveau. Die Konstruktion des L\u00fcfters, gepaart mit der hochwertigen Verarbeitung, erm\u00f6glicht eine effiziente K\u00fchlung bei minimaler Ger\u00e4uschentwicklung.Die Ger\u00e4uschkulisse des L\u00fcfters ist nahezu unh\u00f6rbar. Selbst bei h\u00f6heren Drehzahlen bleibt der L\u00fcfter erstaunlich leise, was besonders w\u00e4hrend intensiver Gaming-Sessions oder rechenintensiver Aufgaben von Vorteil ist. Die PWM-Funktion erm\u00f6glicht eine pr\u00e4zise Anpassung der L\u00fcftergeschwindigkeit an die Bed\u00fcrfnisse des Systems.Die chromax.black.swap-Version des L\u00fcfters verleiht meinem Desktop-System eine \u00e4sthetisch ansprechende Note. Die M\u00f6glichkeit, die mitgelieferten Anti-Vibrations-Pads und Farb-Akzente zu tauschen, erm\u00f6glicht eine individuelle Anpassung an den pers\u00f6nlichen Stil.Insgesamt kann ich den Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.black.swap L\u00fcfter uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen. Die Kombination aus erstklassiger K\u00fchlleistung, minimaler Ger\u00e4uschkulisse und individueller Anpassungsm\u00f6glichkeit macht ihn zu einer lohnenswerten Investition f\u00fcr alle, die Wert auf Qualit\u00e4t und Performance legen.",
