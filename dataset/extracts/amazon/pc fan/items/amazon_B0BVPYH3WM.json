                "reviewText": "This exhaust fan works great. I have had it and tested it for over a month now. It is very quiet, I wish bathroom motors were this quiet, next the power dial also controls the speed of the fan. the fan speed is completely adjustable this is a HUGE bonus. Most air duct exhaust fans are either on or off, this one has fan speed control. It hooks up pretty easy the length of the cord is about 6 feet which is good. The on off switch is the dial, so the only negative is the switch position. I wish the switch was closer to the outlet and further away from the actual inline booster module.",

I instead removed the controller completely and directly wired it to the plug! For my application this way works just as well!",

                "reviewText": "The fan ran for a few seconds after plugging it in, with the switch in the \"off\" position, and then stopped. After that, it would not run in any switch position until unplugged for a few minutes and plugged in again... with the same sequence/result. Assuming the issue is with some kind of self-resetting fuse/breaker inside the switch, combined with shorted/defective wiring. Returning for a replacement since I just got it about 20 minutes ago. Hoping it's just luck of the draw and I happened to get a bad one, but will certainly test the next one thoroughly before keeping it. Would recommend anyone ordering this product to unbox it and check it immediately, instead of waiting too long and finding out after it's too late to return it.",

The only obvious negative was that the diameter is slightly less than the 4\u201d stated. This may call for extra fabrication for ductwork in some cases. The unit has metal blades and housing that seem sturdy but lightweight. I am using it to provide negative ventilation for a CNC machine housing, so perfect for a modest air flow to keep fumes out of adjoining living area. I would probably by this brand again because it appears well made. I do not know how durable it will be as I just put it into service.",
