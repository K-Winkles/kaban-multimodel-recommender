                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Being new to PC building, I confirmed with the seller that the reason for the cluster of connectors is for daisy-chaining, eliminating the need for any hub! Since I\u2019ve done this, my build looks much cleaner and organized. Grab these fans while they\u2019re available, because I\u2019m sure they will go out of stock again at some point!I picked up these fans when I saw some YouTube reviews and was going to transfer all of my PC parts into a brand new case, where I had the freedom to choose what fans I wanted. I always loved the dual ring halo look on fans like this, but did not want to pay the hefty CoolerMaster price tag. Here comes PCCooler in the clutch with these cheap but durable quality knockoff fans. I love the braided cables, rubber corners, the brightness, speed, little to no noise, and overall performance of these fans. I didn\u2019t use the remote function or the hub that came with the 3-pack, but I purchased and used the much larger hub instead and that all worked with my motherboard.The only knock I would give this product is the two cables being chained together, creating a cluster of 4 connectors. It can be a wreck trying to organize but it\u2019s worth it when you think about how much was spent on these fans. Can\u2019t complain!",

Not too loud, gorgeous consistent, bright RGB effects, and the double Halo look from the sides is awesome. They can be a bit on the loud side at full rotation(1400 rpm), but most of us gamers are wearing headsets so not a big deal. They actually worked quite well as my radiator fans. It\u2019s also worth noting that they put some quality into their builds. OH! And let\u2019s not forget to mention they actually manage to center the fan stickers! I cannot tell you how many budget fan sets I\u2019ve tried out and had crazy wobbly Art going on in my build \ud83e\udd2a Give this company(especially these fans) a go and I bet you\u2019ll love them! \ud83d\udc95",

                "reviewText": "I Highly recommend these fans. They are very quiet, and the RGB looks great. They use a standard 3-pin rgb plug (not a proprietary plug) so you can plug them directly into your Motherboard if it has 3-pin 5v ARGB headers. If not the included controller works good too. The PWM fans work great with my Asrock motherboard fan tuning software. They run super quiet even at full speed. The only noise you hear is air moving, and they move plenty of it. They feel like a high quality product not cheap or flimsy. Definitely worth the money. Would buy again.",
