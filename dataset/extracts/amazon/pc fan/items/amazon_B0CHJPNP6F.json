The one remaining was loud but not noisy, you know? I guess I got used to it, but I'm pretty sure it has been getting louder.So I'm glad I got the 3 pack, which is a great deal compared to the single fans from the bigger brands. I replaced both fans - the really old loud one, and the newer loud one (ha). The old 7 blade fans are gone, in with these 9 blade jobs. More blades, ball bearings, maybe slower speed I don't know what's magic about them -- but these are SO quiet! I love the product description \"Quiet sound like falling leaves. \" I think I can hear the CPU fan over the case fans now. The air coming out is cool and at least subjectively, seems to produce about the same air flow.And they look darn good, too.I'm a fan.Sorry, couldn't resist the punny dad joke.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Worth $6-$7 a fan",
                "reviewText": "If you are looking at these, my guess is you just want to add some RGB to your pc, and maybe provide a little crossflow, intake, exhaust.These are NOT fans you would want to use to cool a CPU/Radiator. They are rated for a max of 1200rpm.You get what you pay for, these do NOT come with a hub/controller, but you can daisy chain them, just make sure you have one 4pin CPU_FAN on your mobo.Im giving 5 stars because I assume most people looking at these know what they are getting into. Please note these are not ARGB, they are RGB, but still add fantastic color to an otherwise dark setup.This is definitely not a negative review, I just want to make it known these are not high RPM fans that should be responsible for your AIO/RADIATOR/COOLER TOWER, but are a fantastic way to provide additional airflow at a very fair price, and also great for older builds that do not have 3-pin ARGB headers.Hope this helps, would recommend and would buy again! Easy to install.See attached pics-this is a 2016 build with an MSI MB i7-7700/1080 GPU. It had no RGB inside the case other than the little light strip seen in the picture.\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

                "reviewText": "Replaced my old front fan with two (case only came with one front preinstalled but had slots for 2) and installed the third next to the PSU to pull up air from the bottom to give some air to the GPU.First thing I did was feel the airflow because the fans don't have markings for airflow, and noticed it's pushing about as much air as a 3 year olds fart. Having more fans seems to be making up for the lack of flow from each fan, but will probably be upgrading later on down the road to some higher cfm fans, as you can almost not even feel the airflow from these just holding them in your hands.But, complaining aside, they are whisper quiet, literally can't hear any of these fans while at my desk, just wish they ran maybe a bit faster (they're all connected via molex). And they do push more air than the singular one they replaced, my computer is cooler.",

They look nice and they feel like they're solidly made but since they only have 3 pin and a molex plug I ended up returning them.So can't speak to the quality of the product but the store page should be changed to be more accurate.",
