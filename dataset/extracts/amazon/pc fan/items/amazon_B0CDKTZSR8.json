I replace my old HBA controller with a new LSI 9300-16i card to accomplish this upgrade. While this allowed me to double my storage, it also resulted in my server running much hotter. I started to receive random reboots of the server every few hours. To fix this, I temporarily placed a large external fan pointing into the server. These 3 packs of 120mm fans were ordered to replace my existing internal 120mm PWM fans that are no longer moving sufficient air to cool my server. This new set is moving much more air and has fixed my overheating issue. Using these fans, I am now running at the full 1200 RPM rate.",

I have NO idea why case makers have trended to not include enough fans in a case to give proper airflow...These 3 fans are a great value, and came appropriately boxed. I wish they were 4pin PWM, but the full fan speed isn't obnoxious.Gets the job done, plain black, low cost.Definitely recommend.",

The blades have a much steeper pitch than I\u2019ve seen before in a PC fan and as a result they tend to be a bit louder than another fan I recently bought to replace a dying fan in my every day PC. Nose quality aside, these fans should move lots of air and keep everything nice and cool. And the price is excellent as well.",

They have rubber isolate pads (peel and stick) and all the screws included to install into any case that supports 120mm sizes. Fans are very quiet and move a lot of air which is exactly why I wanted to try these out. Since the LED light craze took over almost all the fan manufactures it's been hard to find a decent fan for a reasonable cost. These Vetroo fans fill the void with everything you need with a perfect price point.",
