It\u2019s a very bright, very smooth looking LED ring, with 4 LEDs in the center as well (16 total). I have not noticed any noise, even using two as exhaust and they keep it cool at a steady 1200 RPM.I dinged this on installation due to the hoops (and $) you have to go through to set up the RGB. The fan will plug into any sysfan on the motherboard. However, unless you have a jcorsair header, you apparently can\u2019t run these on a regular RGB header. Especially not if you wish to use iCUE.I already had a Lightning Node Pro, but it turns out the fan is a 4 pin RGB whereas the Node only sockets 3 pins. So I then ordered the Commander Pro thinking it would work, but apparently the fan slots are for RPM control, not RGB. So I cancelled it.Turns out only the fan hub will receive the RGB cables. They sell this on Corsair\u2019s site for $10, but I did not want to wait. At the time of writing this, it has already been a week since I ordered. So what do I do? Buy the $130 pack of three fans, a fan hub and a Node. I had only intended to get one, but you need BOTH the hub and the Node to use the RGB...Absolutely ridiculous and expensive. I hate that I endorsed that but these fans do look good at least...",

If you want a slick looking computer with great cooling performance this is the way to go. I bought there for $90 a pack cause I got a deal from the U.K. Amazon. Great price for some pretty great fans.Pros: There are a ton of awesome lighting features.They cool very well.It's a ton of fun to show them off.Cons: The're pretty pricey.They are difficult to install because you have to pre drill the screw holes. This wasn't nearly as hard as it was for my Noctua fans though. Another reason it was hard was because I have a really big CPU fan that I had to take out and put back in several times.Depending on how well you want your computer cooled, for instance max speed on all fans, they can be loud (I don't really care about this but some people do).Final comments: One last note is that there are two wires per fan. An RGB and a fan power connector. I have six fans. Lots of wires means lots of cleanup. This can take a while, but I also bought the Corsair Commander Pro. This piece keeps all of the wires in one spot and it looks very clean in the front of the computer. All you need extra for the Commander Pro is an RGB hub which comes with the three pack of ll120 fans.Thanks for reading, hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "These fans are great and are plenty bright, but one you get to the back of the case that's when things get messy.Let's start with performance and sound, these fans are pretty quiet and on par with other Corsair fansin that regard, and as for cooling they work pretty well and push hot air out of my computer pretty quickly and keeps temps low, my GPU (RTX 3070ti) gets to around the mid 60's under full load and the CPU (i5-11600kf) In the 50's but that's with the ml series on a aio in the front. these temps are pretty comfortable for menow getting to installation and the wiring. Corsair is basically know for their mess of wires when it comes to their fans, and these are no different, actually worse in that regard. So these fans have the usual 1 fan cable and one RGB cable, and you have to plug it in to one of their fan hubs, normal so far. So I have already have a commander core and commander pro, I just plugged them in to some of my existing ports and I turned on the computer, they lit up for a second, then went back off and didn't show up in icue. So now you need the Manual. And apparently they need to be wired in sequence of each other, so for example these need to be plugged in, in spot 1-2-3 or 4-5-6, etc. They cant be split up by a different type of fan or RGB device, but once plugged in, in sequence they turned on and started doing the normal lighting effects. So these add a extra layer of complexity compared to their normal RGB fans like the ml series. But I guess that's the price you have to pay to be in the Corsair ecosystem.",

They are super quiet without even making a fan curve in the bios. The amount of cables I could do without, but I don't mind too much.**Keep in mind the usb 2.0 cable to go to your motherboard is VERY short. I put the led hub that connects the rgb hub to the motherboard too far away from a usb header and had to painfully rip it off when I had already put the adhesive on (don't worry, it doesn't rip off any paint). Other than that, I had a very easy time putting these in my pc. Would highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Score: 9.1/10Corsair's LL Series LL120 RGB provides a unique blend of style, performance, and customizability. With its dynamic lighting options and efficient cooling capabilities, this set of fans is an excellent addition to any high-performance PC setup, earning a notable 9.1 out of 10.Corsair's LL120 RGB fans are a perfect mix of aesthetics and performance. With dual light loops and 16 independent RGB LEDs spread across two separate light loops, these fans offer a vibrant visual effect that can elevate the look of any PC build. Whether you want a single color, a cycling rainbow, or complex light patterns, these fans offer unmatched customizability.Performance-wise, the LL120 RGB doesn't disappoint. With 600-1500 RPM speed and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control, these fans offer high airflow (up to 43.25 CFM) and static pressure, efficiently cooling your system while maintaining low noise levels.The inclusion of the Lighting Node Pro in the pack allows for easy customization of lighting effects and colors using the Corsair iCUE software. The software is user-friendly, allowing for synchronization of lights across all Corsair devices and the creation of unique lighting effects.The build quality of the fans is top-notch. The blades are designed to ensure excellent airflow, and the fan body is durable. Despite their performance, the fans run remarkably quiet, allowing for an unobtrusive PC experience even under heavy load.However, one drawback of the LL120 RGB is that the installation and configuration process can be somewhat complex, especially for beginners. The fans and the Lighting Node Pro require multiple cables, making cable management a potential challenge. Additionally, although the iCUE software is powerful, it can be overwhelming for first-time users due to its wide array of options.In conclusion, the Corsair LL Series LL120 RGB fans are an excellent choice for those looking to combine performance and aesthetics in their PC setup. Despite the slightly complex setup, the impressive cooling performance, stunning lighting effects, and build quality make this 3-fan pack a worthy addition to any high-end PC.",
