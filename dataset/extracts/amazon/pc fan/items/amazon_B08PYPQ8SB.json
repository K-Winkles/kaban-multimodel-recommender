                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastically bright ARGB Case Fans!",
                "reviewText": "I bought these to go into a rebuild that I was giving to my nephew for a Christmas present. I wanted to get fans that had ARGB capability, but that also weren't super-expensive. I settled on these, and have been quite happy with them.The fans themselves are solidly built, include great accessories, and are clearly designed with the budget enthusiast in mind. The RGB LEDs are very bright, and appear to project better color than fans at twice the cost. For ~$23 for three fans, I'd say that this is one of the best values going right now.If I was to downscore them for anything, here's what it'd be:1) I had one fan that had what I can only guess was a bad hub/bearing, so when it got up to speed, it sounded like either the world's tiniest weed-whacker or an angry cricket. My wife couldn't hear it, but I could from two rooms away. But, when you consider that I bought about 14 of these (between the CPU cooler and the three-packs of fans, that's not terrible).2) The ARGB plugs are a little chunky - although this is likely only going to be a problem if you're using specific manufacturers of ARGB fan hubs. I tried these fans with the Cooler Master device, and the ARGB housing was a little chonky - I had no issue with a different manufacturer, though. (You can also use the included 4-fan ARGB cables, although I do suggest using electrical tape for that extra emphasis on keeping them together, but that's a belt-and-suspenders-type idea, and not at all required or even necessary.)3) This isn't anything about these fans, but the ARGB connector as a whole is one of THE WORST connecters that I've seen in over 30 years of building PCs. That said, the ARGB connecters on these fans was FAR better than most that I've seen in the past.As you can see though, I didn't actually downscore for these items, because for me they were all easily offset small potatoes.End result, great budget fans, and I think that most folks will be quite pleased with this as a purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "Excellent value for money RGB fans",
                "reviewText": "One thing that may not be clear. These fans come with a power splitter cable and an RGB splitter cable. Basically, you can daisy-chain up to 4 fans from the 3 pin RGB header form a MB with one splitter cable and the other splitter cable can daisy-chain the PWM power for the fan power.Again, to be clear. When these things say 3 pin for the RGB, it's the 4 pin socket that has 1 pin missing. These are also called ARGB or the \"digital\" version. Basically, this is the 5 Volt version, which is the easier one to use as you can't get the cable the wrong way round. The other version, the 12 Volt one, can be a bit confusing and you can easily get the cable the wrong way round, which can cause damage.As for the fans. They are quiet enough, I've heard quieter and I have heard much louder. On slower speeds they are nice and quiet and it's likely that your GPU fans will mask any of the noise from these fans.The light is good, not too bright and not dull either. If you have 3 or 4 of these in your system you should be happy with the overall brightness and the colours look very good.As for durability. Of course, only time will tell but out of the box I have no reason to second them.All in all, these are excellent value for money and I will definitely be buying more for other builds and would totally recommend them.",
