Topped off with Noctua\u2019s trusted premium-grade SSO2 bearing and more than 150,000 hours MTTF, the NF-12x15 PWM chromax.black.swap is the perfect choice for all users who value individual, focused build aesthetics just as much as class-leading quality and performance.",

SSO2 bearing The NF-A12x15 features the further optimised second generation of Noctua's renowned, time-tested SSO bearing. With SSO2, the rear magnet is placed closer to the axis to provide even better stabilisation, precision and durability. Metal-reinforced motor hub With many larger-diameter slim fan designs, the shorter axis and bearing lead to a reduced running stability and lifespan. The NF-A12x15 uses a metal-reinforced motor hub, a measure typically found in high-speed industrial fans, in order to ensure Noctua\u2019s signature stability and longevity. Optional coloured cables Noctua\u2019s chromax line fans use a modular cabling system and come pre-fitted with a fully sleeved black NA-EC1 30cm cable. For refined colour coordination, white, red, blue, green and yellow 30cm NA-EC1 cables plus corresponding NA-YC1 y-cables are available separately.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't built a PC in over ten years so I researched and agonized over pretty much every component before I bought them. Any apprehension you have before spending money on these fans is totally understandable. They're expensive, but what I got in delivery was worth it.The packaging is quality, with the fan and connected extension, and a separate container tucked in the box for the colored anti-vibration pads.The fans are slender, heavy, and when you flick them they'll go for what seems like forever. The color anti-vibration pads are a neat touch and come in multiple colors. Kids wanted each to be a rainbow.Installation had some headaches because the provided screws didn't mesh well with the holes in my NR600 case. They required a lot of torque to tap into the plastic of the fan but tightened securely after that. Removing them, in the incredibly unlikely event that you might have a mental lapse and install the fan pointing the wrong direction, is a cinch.When the time came to turn my new PC on I admit I panicked because I couldn't hear the fans. With my ceiling fan going I can't hear them at all. These run a nearly silent low frequency hum that I can barely hear over ambient noise.There's a premium price to pay for silence with air movement but it's totally worth it. Just be aware that unlike the brown and tan version, there's no splitter included. You'll have to find your own splitter or a PWM header for each fan if you want speed control.Pros: Scary quiet. Moves a lot of air. Feels sturdy. Stickers!Cons: Expensive. Weird short cord with an extension attached. Expensive.",

                "reviewText": "These are some really fantastic (pun very intended) little fans. Their tone, and volume, output are all quite acceptable. They will get a little on the higher pitched side at full speed directly next to a mesh air panel, but at most operating speeds it barely makes any noticeable noise. They provide a lot of air movement, and certainly have enough static pressure output for being used on radiators. The all black aesthetic is great, took Noctua long enough!The only gripes I do have are very small and, in my opinion, don't merit a take-off of any stars. The first is that while I love the black-out look of the fan, the brass-colored fan hub reinforcement on the front fan surface is a little clashing. Secondly, I'm not sure what's up with Noctuas approach of have a female plug RIGHT at the end of the fan and then using an extension cable to actually plug it in, but I'm not a big fan of this approach. In my eyes it adds an unnecessary point of failure, or just bulk, to the fan frame. Considering these are likely going to be installed in VERY tight clearance areas, that's not what you want.Other than that, they're flawless. Would gladly buy more. I'll present a little scenario here that might help some people. Say you have around 50mm of clearance for a radiator and a fan. You were originally considering a ~25mm thick radiator, and a traditional 25mm thick fan. Or, you can get maybe a ~35mm thick radiator and one of these 120x15mm fans. I'd suggest the set up with the thicker radiator and this fan. The extra surface area of the radiator will allow for better heat dissipation, and the fan still has plenty of strength and ability to disperse the heat output of a radiator. It'd say the same if you're in a similar position with heatsinks as well, though that's a bit more rare.",

It's not the cheapest out there (by far), but if you're already looking at it, and you're here reading the reviews, it's cause you know what Noctua brings to the table.Yes, even at full speed, it's very quiet while also moving a lot of air. Go buy it already.There are no vibrations (rubber insulating pads), the fan ramps up and down at a steady pace and doesn't make any fuss about it at all, and it moves a ton of air. These slim versions are for top and rear exhaust in my system, and I have one 140x25 as intake, all Noctua. Even at full speed (1500 rpm) it's only as loud as ambient noice in my home office (internal room, pretty quiet itself). At 300 rpm the fans/my case is silent sitting on my desk, literally three feet from my head.I'm an engineering nerd so I care about reliability as much as sound and thermals and I will have long, LONG been done and past this case when these fans fail (iirc 150,000 hours MTBF? That's 17 years @ 24/7/365. They may outlive me). Black color scheme is complimentary of the case, and the different color pads that come with it give you options if you'd like.No RGB, extreme reliability, whisper quiet operation, and high CFM? I was put off a bit at the price per fan but now, honestly, I'm a Noctua fan for life. Which my fans might very well outlast.",

This was perfect.Now Noctua is a little more money but they are the best. I'm using it in my 3D printer for years and it's still quiet and run flawlessly. Thanks for making it in other color than Beige/brown. When it the time to build a show pieces PC, Beige / Brown doesn't work.I have to say, the little foam \"Accent\" is a nice touch and extremely functional.If you guys come out with a 120mm with addressable LED, I will not think twice and will replace all my fan with-it as long as it's not Beige / Brown ;-)I Love-it and I'm recommending this brand of fan more than any other out-there.
