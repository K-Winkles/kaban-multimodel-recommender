I leave them at 15-25% usually in SignalRGB to mitigate that.Nonetheless they're fantastic fans that are extremely quiet at 500rpm and flow a lot of air when you need them to.

                "reviewText": "This set of fans were not compatible with my front panel fan controller. You will probably need to get a controller specifically for PWM fans only, for these to work correctly. I used a different brand of PWM fan and they worked fine with my fan controller (and they were half the price). These also do not have interconnectability . You will need to connect each one individually, however they do supply an RGB splitter. I am giving them 3 stars because they do not have the same value for price as the others I used.",
