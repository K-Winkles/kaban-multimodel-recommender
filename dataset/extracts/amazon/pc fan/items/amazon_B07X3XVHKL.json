Also, a lot of thought went into them performing well as case fans as well. A little measuring shows them quite energy efficient (more so than the Corsair Mag-Lev fans I run, and quieter).Be Quiet, if don't know is an excellent company that makes quality, high-end products at reasonable prices. It shows here.",

I have four (3x 140mm and 1x 120mm) in my NZXT H500 and I have *never* heard them since installing them a few months ago. PWM function works great and I think these fans look super clean in a mostly-white build. The installation was AWESOME too because there are no screws involved, just little plastic pieces that are really easy to take on and off.I actually became a bit of a be quiet! stan because of these fans; since getting them, I've bought a new Straight Power 11 PSU and a Shadow Rock 3 (White edition) CPU cooler. Both of those products have also been completely silent and are worth the cost.TLDR; pricey but dead silent. 9/10",

While these are truly excellent and quiet fans and an incredible value in the case at the price point, I wanted an all white build. I grabbed one be quiet! Shadow Wings 2 white fan when Amazon finally had one in stock.I love it! It runs quieter at a higher RPM than the pure wings fan and looks great in my build. When the white versions become available again, I am going to pick up another one or two to replace the black fan that is still in my case. That said, my case is virtually silent as is, but I expect even with a 3rd Shadow Wings fan, it will be even silenter (if that is even a word).In all - I love be quiet! products and love this Shadow Wings 2 140mm white case fan.",
