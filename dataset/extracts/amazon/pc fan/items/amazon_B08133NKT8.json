They keep the shed very cool and comfortable! I would use them in a PC no problem.",

The only con that I could think of for these fans is the type of plug they put on the wire and they don't come with any type of plug adapter. So I had to do some wire cutting and splicing, but I specialize in computer work and electrical work with both AC and DC currents, so it wasn't that big of a problem for me. Other people though, that could be an issue. So I gave it a low rating on installation.",

If I tilt it one way, it stops making the noise, but when it's upright, it's making that noise. The other one is fine, but it's still a little too loud, especially for an 80mm fan.",
