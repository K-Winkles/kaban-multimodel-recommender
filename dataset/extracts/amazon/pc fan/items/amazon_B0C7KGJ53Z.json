The motherboard of each PC did not have very many fan headers, so this solution worked great. The color matched the rest of the build, as did the braiding on the outside of the wires. I always use 4 pin splitters for variable speed fans, which is why I specifically got these. They seem well made and sturdy, I don't anticipate any issues in the future. I will be buying more of these",

                "reviewText": "I got this two-pack to allow me to mount more than the 2 fans my motherboard supports connecting. While it does work and lets you connect multiple fans into a single header, I did have a bit of trouble getting them to behave, as only 1 of the 3 tail-ends is still 4-pin for fan connecting. Easy enough thing to fix if you have the time to set up the fan control, but not as plug-and-play as I had hoped/expected. Still would recommend in a pinch though.",

These have a bit of length on them, but you may need to consider extensions based on how far apart your fans are, or just length so you can cable manage. Material quality is higher than I expected for the price.",

One connector has 4 pins to detect the fan speed, while the others just match the PWM output. The cable has tough protective braiding.No complaints. Works as it should.",
