                "reviewText": "I had a cheap case with pretty thin metal for the front panel where I was mounting two fans. I tried 4 different sets of fans from brand like Corsair, Cooler Master, Arctic, and beQuiet! in this case, and could never silence an annoying harmonic buzz/pitch. The fans, especially the beQuiet 140mm, were dead silent, until mounted to this case. If I stopped either fan...the noise stopped. I finally decided to try these rubber mounts...and they worked! The harmonic noise is almost entirely gone, except at very high fan speeds (during testing only). The only thing I would change is the amount of material on the fan side of these. A little more material would disconnect the fan body from the case completely. However, for the money, I am very pleased, and will recommend these or similar products to anyone experiencing unwanted noise from their fans.",
