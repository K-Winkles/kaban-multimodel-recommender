                "reviewText": "I more or less expected what I received with this product. It's inexpensive, bare bones, and the quality is on the lower side. If you don't need anything fancy, it will probably do the job though. If the appearance of your system matters, or if it's cramped inside the case and short circuiting exposed pins is a concern, you'll probably want something with a plastic case over it and not this product.The first issue I had is that the connectors for the PWM and SATA power are not secured very well to the PCB. There are some tiny plastic pins that pop out with very little force on the SATA power end and then they tend to get bent/break with the stress of unplugging/plugging in the power. The power and PWM pins are soldered in well, so unless you stress it a lot, it's just an annoyance. One could always apply a couple drops of glue and that would likely solve the issue.The other issue that I had, which may depend on your hardware, is that the PWM only works on my \"System 4 Pump\" fan header on my Gigabyte AORUS z590 Elite Ax Wifi motherboard. The other headers have the fans running at full speed all the time. I was then able to map that header to the CPU temperature sensor in the Gigabyte software and so it ramps up all four fans in my system simultaneously, based on current CPU temps.The adhesive pad on the back may or may not be a convenience, but I just stuck it to the inside top of my case in one of the unused fan bays. If you want to mount it to a stand-off using the hole in the center, you might want to remove the adhesive.",
