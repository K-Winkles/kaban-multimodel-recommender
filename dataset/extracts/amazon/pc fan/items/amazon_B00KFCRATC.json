Thanks to the outstanding aerodynamic efficiency of the NF-F12 design and the use of a novel three-phase motor, the industrialPPC version provides superior airflow and pressure capacity while keeping noise levels and power consumption moderate as against comparable high-speed fans. While its fibre-glass reinforced polyamide construction and certified water and dust protection make the NF-F12 industrialPPC suitable for operation in challenging environments, the renowned SSO2 bearing technology ensures an MTTF of over 150.000hrs. Topped off with Noctua\u2019s trusted reliability, the NF-F12 industrialPPC is an ideal choice for highly demanding applications that require superior flow rates and ultimate dependability.",

Combined with the industrialPPC series' robust polyamide construction and advanced protection features, this makes the fan ideal for challenging industrial applications. Three-phase motor design While most axial fans use single-phase motors with 4 slots, Noctua's industrialPPC fans feature a three-phase design with 6 slots, which provides smoother transitions between the slots and thus allows for even higher running smoothness, further reduced vibrations and unprecedented energy efficiency. IP52 water- and dust protection Thanks to a special varnish coating that covers the motor and PCB, the NF-F12 industrialPPC complies with the ingress protection rating IP52. This means that it is not only highly dust resistant but also withstands dripping water equivalent to 3mm rainfall per minute. Fibre-glass reinforced polyamide construction Both the impeller and the frame of Noctua\u2019s industrialPPC fans are made entirely from fibre-glass reinforced polyamide. This material can withstand temperatures up to 140\u00b0C and makes the fans even more robust and break-proof than Noctua\u2019s standard fibre-glass reinforced PBT fans.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have a high-end Workstation (purchased in 2020) that has a Threadripper 3960x, 3080 FE GPU, m.2 SSD expander and 1600W power supply. When I bought the system, I really didn't consider the fans/ cooling because the cooling for the CPU was a ENERMAX solution which came with fans as well as the case a Lian Li Mesh Cool II and used those. This was the first desktop I've had since early 2000's and had been using laptops (workstations) for the past 8 years +/- since I graduated college/ grad school.Last week the ENERMAX cooler gave signs it was dying, had the pump ramped up to max and all fans to max and my CPU was still hot at 70-90C... Because I remember the attendant at Micro Center saying ENERMAX AIO had issues, but it was the only cooling solution in store that would be adequate with the CPU, I rolled the dice. It lasted me 3 yrs, I honesty thought it would have died earlier, so I wasn't caught off guard completely.So I decided to go all out with air coolers and found that the best was a Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3, Premium-Grade CPU Cooler for AMD sTRX4/TR4/SP3 (140mm, Brown) which brought me to research the Noctua NF-F12 iPPC 3000 PWM, Heavy Duty Cooling Fan, 4-Pin, 3000 RPM (120mm, Black) for the case as I wanted new and better ones that had no RGB. I considered the NF-F12 over the other Noctua alternatives for the sheer power, 3000 RPM and the volume of air it pushed just was un matched. I rather have the power and not needed than need it and not have it. So my biggest concern was that to keep all this hot hardware cool, all fans would have to run at high speeds and this would mean noise.To my delight after installing them, the entire system runs at 40C and below and the noise is not an issue as I can run these at 1k RPM and no real noise. I have 6 of these fans, 3 at the front (push-config - 800-1200 RPM +-300), 2 on top (push-config- 800-1200 RPM +-300) and 1 at the back (pull-config - 700-1000 RPM +-300) as well as having the NH-U14S with a 2x fans push-pull config 1500/1200 RPM.I probably get temps even further down if I tweak it further. But as it is... I'm very happy with the results in terms of both performance and noise levels. Yes if you run these at full 3000 RPM they are loud (not as bad as I feared either, but obviously loud) but the volume of air is also incredible.One little difference is because these are \"industrial\" the fans only come with 4 screws and that's it.I believe it was a good investment, specially because this machine is my daily driver for work (I'm a Data Scientist & Developer for SAS solutions). I got reliability and simplicity of air cooling as well as the brute power of massive air-flow if I need.I will definitely consider using Noctua cooling solutions on my next build when I decide to upgrade this machine sometime in the next couple of years.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful and quiet, if you know how to set them up!",
                "reviewText": "I love these fans! I was hesitant to order them because of some reviewers saying they're horribly loud and others saying they were quiet. I was willing to take the risk and bet on the fact that those complaining they were too loud just didn't take any time to configure them, and I am so glad I did!I installed 4 of these 140mm fans and 3 120mm in my new rig and I absolutely love them. I have 2 140's as front intake, a 140 as rear exhaust, a 140 as bottom intake next to PSU, 2 120's on my H100i radiator and a third 120 next to the radiator as exhaust. They all come with rubber brackets and I installed all but the radiator fans with Cosmos rubber rivets. Super easy! They all come with rubber sleeved cables that aren't too short and aren't too long. I did have to run a y-splitter for my two front fans because I ran out of pins on my motherboard, and it was enough of an extension to help them make it across the huge case to get them plugged in. If you have a large case and intend to put these near the front of your chassis, you will most definitely need extensions so plan ahead! I'd rather have to extend one set of fans than have 7 fans with super long cables cluttering things up.After the quick and easy installation, I powered everything on and I was shocked at how loud it was. It was loud enough that my 10 year old and I had to raise our voices to hear each other clearly when sitting 4-5 feet away. HOWEVER, using ASUS' UEFI on the Maximus VII Hero motherboard, I was able to use the built in Qfan to quiet them down enough to the point that I could tolerate sitting near it while I installed the OS.Once Windows was installed, I installed AI Suite (included with my motherboard, you may need to locate another fan controller if you don't have an ASUS board) and went into fan setup. It has 4 predefined modes to choose from with further customization possible if desired. Silent mode literally turns off all fans except the CPU fan, which it turns down considerably and the entire rig is dead quiet. Standard mode is a step up but still extremely quiet, even when sitting only 2-3 feet away. When on the other side of the room playing games on the TV, I don't hear it at all. The other two settings include turbo (around 1500 rpm) and full power. When all fans are running at top speed (about 2700-2800 rpm), it is extremely loud. Turbo is tolerable. The sweet spot is around 900rpm, which is enough to keep an EVGA GTX 980 Ti under 60 degrees while gaming and keeps my i7-4790k under 40 degrees, even under load. The result is a very stable, quiet and cool rig. I haven't found anything that can cause this system to break a sweat and I attribute it largely to these fans.I am so very pleased with these fans, I can't say enough good things about them. They are roughly twice as expensive as other popular fans, but I'd much rather take the cool, quiet performance of Noctua fans than have fancy loud LED fans in my rig. I'll definitely be picking up more Noctua's when I build my husband's rig next month.",

                "reviewText": "Love the air flow of this for my new build on my HYTE Y60 case, maybe noisy when temperatures rise but it does the job. I didn't want to buy loop system yet as I need to do a little more research. I got 4 140mm intakes with 4 120 exhaust fans. I have the 120mm Noctua fan on the back at high RPMs but it's pretty quiet for my ears. There's a Corsair H150i AIO on top for my i9-12900k. It can get noisy at high speeds but the air flow for computer fans is the best in the market. I was going to go with Corsair because I wanted RGB but rather have functionality that's efficient and keeping Temps under control. Quality is solid but I did wish the made it in solid white but that's no biggie. If I were to build a comp for a friend, these will be my go brand as the others don't compare.",

Despite being very loud, i had to limit them to 75% of their potential so i can keep my sanity during very intense workloads, unless if needed.(When the cpu reaches 90\u00b0c) They work as intended and blow air very well. Work flawlessly good with my new watercooling aio with 3 of them to cool my i7 13700k at 280w in the worst cases. it never throttles even during benchmarks such as prime95. For their power, the noise could be worse, but the fact that it's a noctua product makes it already reliable. I do believe that another 3000rpm fan from another brand would be much noisy. definitely the fans for a cpu heatsink to get the most out of it. With the right fan curve, they will still be silent and ramp up only when really needed.",
