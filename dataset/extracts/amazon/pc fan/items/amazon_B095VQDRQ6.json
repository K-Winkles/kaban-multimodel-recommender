I have 3 in each cabinet - 2 pack & 1 pack connected by a USB adapter, and have them plugged in. They\u2019re on 24/7 to provide air flow, and I haven\u2019t noticed them creating any heat. The adjustable speed is nice too - I keep it on the lowest setting.The price is great for what they do, and I plan on putting some up in my Ivar to push air around so I don\u2019t need to leave a regular fan on towards them. These fans are also super easy to install - I just use magnet hooks to hold them in the upper back corners and pointed slightly down. Zip ties would work fine too. They\u2019re small enough to fit anywhere, so I could add more if I ever need to without having to sacrifice any space.Although I\u2019m not using these for my computer, they work great for my plants!",

This fan is very very quiet you can't hear it on low at a foot away you can barely hear it on medium at a foot or two away and even on high you can hear it maybe five or six feet away and it's mostly just the air that you hear not the motor. This is in a quiet room also. Like library quiet.",

The fans I received have a black centre circle/logo with white text. I couldn't contact the seller directly to see if the full white fans were available so Amazon was great in dealing with this quickly and compensating me for the misleading product images.",
