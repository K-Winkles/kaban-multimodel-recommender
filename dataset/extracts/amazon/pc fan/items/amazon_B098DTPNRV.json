I've used these fans in like 3 PCs and never had a dud yet. I like how bright they get and the number of choices for lighting effects. Definitely recommend these at this price point.",

Rgb is daisy chain able to your other fans very easy to do, the hub works good plugs into an extra sata power wire, spits good air, overall if I saw these in a friends computer I would think they are a set of $80-$100 fans. I\u2019m giving a 4 star review because my shipping date was changed 3 times and they weren\u2019t received on time. Very good budget fan, hope this helped someone",

Really good airflow, incredibly quiet, more RGB, single or combined color and brightness options than you could ever possibly want, good cable length on the fans, a fan hub to connect all the fans to with a SATA power connnector and a remote control for your lighting preference! You really can't ask for more at this price, and yes, I'm aware that the fan hub does not connect to the RGB header of your motherboard so that you can control the lights via software directly from your PC, but then again, I refer you once more to the price. Want that feature? Go up 2 or 3 levels higher in price and you'll be set, but at this price range? Best in class, bar none. Five Stars! :-)",
