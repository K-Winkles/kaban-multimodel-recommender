I swapped the non RGB fan to the back while placing this product to the front as it is more visually pleasing.I didn't pay attention to the side profile of this fan as it is practically half the thickness of the non RGB fan I moved to the back end pulling the air that this product pushes through the heatsink fins. So naturally it didn't really fit but I found creative ways to make it work without marring the aesthetics. The fan has many small fins that are relatively close together, allowing it to move a lot of air without working hard. This makes the fan nearly silent as I hear the other non RGB cooler's wine over the operation of this product.My close loop water cooler with its huge radiator was taking up the space I need for the current generation of video cards that are longer and wider than the generations before it. I am considering getting 120mm versions of this product for the front of my case. Great aesthetics and performance for the price.",

I think the rubber corners definitely help quiet down the vibrations too. ID-Cooling has really impressed me as of late and I've been happy with their other fans and coolers. For less than $15 this is a really really great fan I think. I can happily recommend this fan for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to replace my boring brown noctua 92mm fan on my NH-L9x65 and being a fan of ID Cooling products, I was disappointed did not have very bright ARGB lighting. I'm posting a comparison with the Silverstone and you can see in the images, the ID is on the left, that the brightness of the Silverstone on the right matches the brightness of my other components, while the brightness of the ID cooling falls short. Like I said, I'm a big fan of ID Cooling, so I'm posting the review here. They have to do better with this 92mm fan.",
