These are cheaper per unit than my local home depot (1 dollar for a 3 pack) and my local lowes (1 dollar for a 4 pack). Kind of an overkill amount of screws, but this is insurance for stripping them, or dropping them and being unable to get them, or needing to install more fans, or mounting something else that uses these screws...It's a great deal for some good, quality screws.",
