At $15 for three of them, no, surely you jest.Do They Work? Absolutely. Ive gotten about 9-12 months out of them before the \"rattle\" syndrome rears its ugly head.To be completely honest, I am a Smoker that cleans my rig (i5 11th Gen, 32Gb, RTX3070) about every 6 months, so.. I keep them clean, and they last about 9-12 months. No complaints for $15 for three at all. Welcome to affording Cheap China. I get it.Im on my 3rd set in about 3-3.5 years or so.. Still, can't complain. $45 for 3+ years compared to the ridiculous prices of some more popular brands... F-it..Do they push a LOT of air? No... but if your rig is set up right, they Don't need to \"Push Air\" they just need to keep air moving.. and that they do, nicely, and quietly... for about 9-12 months... then its another $15 for 3 of em.. :)",

The brightness of the LEDS is controlled by the voltage of course and they are fully bright at around when the fan speed is at 1000rpm but at this rpm the fans aren't that loud so may as well just run them at this rpm all the time so that the PC is always kept cool.Good fans, worth the buy.",

However, in the description, the cable type was not mentioned and so it it\u2019s a 3 pin fan cable with a molex connector for the LED lighting, it is also very short so make sure that you have a molex extension in case your molex from the psu isn\u2019t long enough to reach the motherboard. Overall they are good fans and would buy again.",

These have the same 19 dBA rating as my original fan. They are really quiet. I can not hear them over my other existing fans. All the screws were provided, although they are not great, but they did fastened the fans and are holding well.",

                "reviewText": "The DIYPC case I purchased has a neat little RGB strip up front and a white reflective mesh to make the whole front end have color. So I figured, it's mesh, it can flow air, why not stick three 120mm fans down the front of it? Enter the upHere 3-pack of 120mm fans. I could've bought Rosewill or Cooler Master or any other number of brands, but they cost more money and don't do anything these can't do.These fans move air into my case, don't make noise, don't rattle, and have all black wiring, screws, and connectors. They look good (because you can't see them, but if you COULD they would look fine). They were no more difficult to install than any other case fan with 4 headless screws. The package included 24 little foam rubber pads to go on the corners. I only needed twelve of these for installation but if I need them for the other side later on down the road, I have extras.I will be purchasing another 3-pack of these soon, because I also put two 120mm fans on the top of my case for exhaust, and they were older Cooler Masters I've had sitting in storage since...uh...2010? So they have ketchup and mustard wiring, silver screws, shiny chrome stickers, and look hideous. I mean they work, and they are on top where I can't see them, but I KNOW they are THERE!Picture shows my computer with no front on it so show the fans spinning silently. If you put your ear to your screen, you can hear how loud they aren't.",

This product, in a three-pak, was less expensive than purchasing a single unit and has the added feature of illumination. Was a simple matter of removing 4 screws and unplugging from the motherboard. Check to see first if your fan is 3- or 4-pin and whether the pins are gapped or equal-distant, then order a replacement that matches what you have. This unit has provisions for both 3- and 4-pin connections.",
