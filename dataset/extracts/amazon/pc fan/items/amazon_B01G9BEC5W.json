I did lose some functionality in addressing the colors, but the fans work and the case is now cool.",

These have been very reliable and do not get warm to the touch either. I have them stacked ontop of each other to save space. Not many name brand quality fan controllers available these days I can vouch that these are safe so far and work. You cannot control each fan individually, it follows which ever fan speed is connected to the shiny/glossy port.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical at first when I saw someone caught this product on fire. I honestly laughed about it, as this product works great for my fans in my case. You just have to plug the header coming from the device into a fan header on your motherboard that isn't your main CPU fan header. READ YOUR MOTHERBOARD MANUAL before installing to a fan header on your motherboard. This product is great for my use and all the fans speed up and down as they should. Make sure you have PWM mode enabled for the specific fan header you plugged this device into so all fans can work properly. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a PWM fan splitter.",

This product is straight forward and works great. It extends the 4-pin fan support of my ASUS motherboard and gives me ample outputs for additional fans.",

This board should have magnetics to install not cheap velcro tape. The wire that connects to the fan controller on the MB is also loose fitting.

                "reviewText": "I desperately needed a Fan Hub after my Capacitor for the CPU fan headers popped. This stood in for a good while until I had to change they types of fans in the system. While it has many connectors for fans, it only has one to the mainboard. sadly it is only controllable up to the lowest speed fan attached to the device. (So if you have two types of fans, one 1000rpm one and two 1600rpm ones it only reads the theoretical maximum of the 1000rpm and the others aren't full speed.) maybe if not connected to the mainbaord it boosts all to max? but that would be too loud.Not complaining, only downsides, great device for what it does. Still highly recommended for similar zone control. (IE Front / Rear / Side) (Top / Top / Bottom) (Front x3 / Top x3) Its generally best to have the GPU sidefan on a separate controller to give it a more direct pressurized environment FYI.",
