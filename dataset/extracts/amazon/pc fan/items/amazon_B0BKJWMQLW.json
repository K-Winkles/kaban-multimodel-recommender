                "reviewText": "Loved these fans. I needed some cheap options for my case so I can drop the temps down during Cyberpunk Liberty.The noise change is miniscule compared to my single start fan in the front and my microphone is close by, can't even tell the difference.I googled a video of how to install these just to be safe and theres a grear video on youtube. There are 4 cords to each fan, 2 are for daisy chaining the power and the other two daisy chaining the color sync.The screws are horrendously bad to get in.At least 2 out of the 4 on each fan were so hard to turn in it feels like you have to make new thread in the fans. I had four screws from an old corsair fan to put in each of them to save my hands a little work, but I'm talking my hand got close to a few blisters from turning the screws in. So just be prepared that you may have to work hard to screw in these fans.But overall they are gorgeous, extremely cheap and feel durable. I'm excited to have them and would give these an easy 5 star.",

                "reviewText": "I got these for a recent budget build and was super surprised by how decent these are for the price. They're certainly nothing spectacular from a performance perspective, but they're mad cheap and spin well enough. The RGB works totally fine, no issues out of the box with an MSI motherboard. They stay pretty quiet as well, placed in the front of a Corsair D4000 airflow you really don't hear them most of the time. The cables are daisy chain-able, so while cabeling can get messy quick, you likely don't have to worry about running out of mobo headers. Overall I think if you're just trying to keep cost down as much as possible, you can't really go wrong with these!",

RGB is smooth, fans are daisy chained, it even has laser authentic stickers on the fans.You simply just cant find anything better at this price point.",

I bought 2 x3 packs and am currently using 4 fans for my Ryzen 7 5700G APU. Idle temps with low usage (YouTube, some browser tabs open) are around 28C - 32C with heavy load temps around 55C - 64C with just the 4 fans + AMD stock CPU Cooler (obviously depends on where people live as temps will vary with environment). When under load the noise level is still relatively low with the obvious air woosh increase. Best I can describe is when under load and my door is closed, you're not hearing anything outside. And if wearing headphones you're barely hearing anything.The only issue that was a bit frustrating was screwing them in as some of the screws would just be very hard to screw in.Overall for the price, quality and performance I highly recommend these fans.",
