                "reviewText": "This fan cost a little more than some other brands but you can tell is very high quality part. Also it included an extension cable, a \u201cY\u201d splitter cable, and a cable that lowers fan speed if running of uncontrolled header, all of which would cost extra if not included. My mother board only has one fan header for the CPU, with this I was able to use the splitter and run both cpu cooler fan and case fan off one header. A bonus of doing it this way is that the case fan is speed controlled by the cpu temperature so runs quiet or turns off when not needed and spins up when computer gets hot. No wasted money for RGB lights only whats needed.",

I had to remove the upper corners (with fan lying flat) as there is a shroud which goes over the fan holding it in place and it would not fit with the top rubber corners.The fan is silent and moves a good amount of air. I've used Noctua products in the past and have always been happy with them.",

You need to remove the rubber isolators from the fan body, but once you do that there is enough thread length on the stock screws to swap this fan in place of the stock fan. Same rated CFM without the low-noise adapter installed, and FAR quieter. Unlike the other fans in the ML30, the CPU fan is a standard 4-pin PWM header.",
