Vortex-Control Notches Noctua's signature Vortex-Control Notches split up trailing edge vortices and thus spread the fan's noise emission over a wider range of frequencies. This measure makes the fan sound more pleasant to the human ear.

Available in black, red, blue, white, green and yellow, these pads not only damp minute vibrations but also allow the fan to be colour-customised in order to coordinate it with popular build colour schemes!",

It neither needs, nor has, liquid CPU cooling.The case in which the computer was assembled came with two three-wire, fans installed. These fans were selected to upgrade to a 4-wire, PWM, fan.Installation was easier than easy and the direction of the airflow was clearly marked on the frame of the fan. The marking of the direction of flow was a nice assist for a first-time computer builder.In use the fans are completely silent and are readily controlled in BIOS. The computer never runs hot, the fans never run at max RPM, so the fans are apparently more than adequate for this build.They are not lighted, but the case has no transparent or translucent surfaces. Lighted fans spark no interest at any rate!In conclusion, these fans were a nice upgrade...noticeably more robust than the originals...for this build. The fans were a totally satisfactory purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I installed it as a case fan in my Antec build. The fan is silently quiet at 900 RPM when my PC is idle or light load, while I do can hear slight humming under my desk at 1300 RPM when my PC is under stress. The 1300 RPM humming is not bad though, but it shows its pale when compared to my other fans in the same build: Antec 3-speed case fans and Noctua CPU sink fan (yes same brand probably even same model ironically) which has no humming and also run at 1300 RPM. I think it might be individual parts difference. so I kept this purchase hoping this fan will stay at 900 RPM load mostly.Installation difficulty is moderate, because it was a replacement in a cramp space of the existing build. I didn't install anti-vibrating corner pads which would be a separate purchase shipment. I didn't know such pad thing exists for Redux mode until after. There are no review says it makes too much difference besides cosmetic so I am lazy to reopen the case for now.I believe in Noctua. The above the another Noctua CPU sink fan has been running ten years 24/7 (yes you read it correct) and still quiet at 1300 RPM. I am convinced.",
