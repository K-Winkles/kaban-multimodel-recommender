Sometimes the cheap ones are only 2 or 3 actual wires in the connector.I ended up needing to modify a couple of them & do some soldering to make a Y connector, project changed a little along the way. But! Worked great, can recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for a new computer build. Some of the fans came with very short cords, barely long enough to reach the connectors on the motherboard, and not long enough for the way I wished to route the cords. First, when I received these cords, I noted how good of a quality they were. Second, they allowed me to route the fan power cables the way I wanted to so that my computer had a much cleaner look. Made it possible to ensure I can add and remove components without the cords getting in the way. Very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "These do exactly what I needed them to do.One downfall is the heat-shrink tubing does not adhere to the sleeving well, and if you bend the cable end to a 90 degree in order to fit into a snug space, the sleeving will come out of the heat shrink. BUT, I have also used more expensive brands and occasionally they do it as well. So, for the money, it's to be expected.Good value with the amount/length of extensions in the kit.",
