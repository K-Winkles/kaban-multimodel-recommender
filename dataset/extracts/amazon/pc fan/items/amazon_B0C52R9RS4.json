Looking at the CFM (slightly lower than fans that come with my case which is perfect for positive case pressure.) and compatible RGB of these fans is what really made these a no brainer for me. Simple to install, especially with a Corsair lighting commander. Overall noise level is also wayyy lower than my previous ITD case fans.",

My motherboard had 2 system fan connections and one pump connection , so connected the two front fans that pull to Sys 1 & 2 and the rear fan to the Pump connector and then in the PC BIOS created a matching curve for them. The RGB connecter was a good fit to my mother board and connected up easily to the 3 fans using the supplied connectors. Love the RGB options however what I love the most is being able to hear myself think again .",
