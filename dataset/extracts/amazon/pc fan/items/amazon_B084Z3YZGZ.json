Not to mention the style & colors of this Fan has a very unique look. Once you figure out where the connections need to go it's easy to set up & install to your liking. I had this product for awhile now & it's still holding up strong with no issues. So at the time when I purchased this product it was going for $9.99. Maybe I got lucky with some special deal going on. But noticed that the Seller has bumped up the price. Regardless if anyone is interested in getting these RGB LED Fans you won't be disappointed.",

In my use case I was attaching to a designer board for Dell and while it did have a three prong pin out there is a chance that the third pin out wasn't intended in any way for lighting as the board also would notify of a disconnected fan if the third pin wasn't in some way attached as I found out when I had a two pin fan connected that I just clipped a corner off of to make it work in the space.",
