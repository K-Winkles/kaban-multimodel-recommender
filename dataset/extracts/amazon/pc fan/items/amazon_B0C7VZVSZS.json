However, I ran into the issue where the ASUS brand fans on the AIO would not fit in the fan hub. The fan hub is very well made to exacting measurements. The ASUS fans ARGB connectors are just slightly too fat to fit. The Master Fans connectors fit fine. Other issue is that some of the wires were too far from it and I'd need to get extensions to be able to connect them all. In the end, I didn't use the hub at all and used the motherboard supplied ARGB splitter that looks kind of like a squid. I had a second one from another build I just started and didn't need and also found that my mobo had a second ARGB port. I used the second squid for that. I can't comment on the functionality. For now, it's going into my drawer for when I need a fan hub.",

                "reviewText": "I have an iBuyPower PC from 2021 and the fans that came with it were terrible. Their fans are proprietary junk that has a six pin connector, making them next to impossible to find direct replacements to attach to their rgb controller. I had to replace every one of the 4 fans in the system TWICE OVER because they failed and developed a loud squeel(no hole to be able to oil them either). Every day, I\u2019d have to open the chassis up and stop the fan(s) and hope when the restarted, they wouldn\u2019t squeel. I finally had enough. I bought this to replace the proprietary fan controller and also for 4 cooler master fans.The install was surprisingly easy. I used the jRainbow 2 header on the motherboard and the same fan header the original controller used and everything fired right up and the MSI Center app saw the new controller and the rgb and fan speeds were then controllable, just like the original.I did keep the original controller in place(plugged into the jRainbow 1 port) to continue to power the motherboard and liquid cooling rgb leds and the MSI app sees both jRainbow 1 and 2 ports individually(giving me more rgb flexibility than I had with just one controller)Overall, this worked great for me on my Z490-A Pro MSI motherboard. Now, no more sqeeling fans!",

I changed the mode from DC to PWM in the Hardware Monitor (which that is what the connector attached to the MOBO is), adjust it to all the fans that applies, and bam the fans are quieter again. Hope this helps!",
