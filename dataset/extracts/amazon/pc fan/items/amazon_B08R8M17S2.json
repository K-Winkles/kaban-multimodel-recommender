They are so quiet that at first I thought I missed the motherboard connectors. I love they have rubber paddings to prevent vibration and they have significantly improved the airflow in my mATX case.I absolutely HATE these fans that are filled with LEDs, but if that is your thing, keep in mind these are BLACK, NO LED, type of deal. To me, that's a winning solution.I highly recommend. This s the best bang for your buck you will get on amazon!",

At the price of 13 dollars 3 120mm fans that at max speed are honestly not loud at all. they do however move a fair amount of air. I have all 4 fan mounts filled with these fans and i have no complaints. few months gone by and still quiet and effective. i will definitely recommend these and ill buy them again eventually. literally my one and only CON is build quality. the fans fell like they could snap quite easily if you bend them. again however i cant fault the product for that because no pc fan is ment to bend so all in all ill have to give it 5/5 even if they die in 1 year itll be a 5/5 because that price is unbeatable.",

I was surprised to see how effective the rubber damping pads were, and the wiring was nice and long. The fans also exceeded my expectations with how quiet they were, while remaining effective.I purchased another set for my TrueNAS build and they worked out so well that I recently grabbed another set and, you guessed it, they work great too!Pros: Very effective; Quiet; Rubber Damping Pads; Long Wires; InexpensiveCons: None.",
