The fan ensures extremely efficient cooling, even with increased air resistance. Therefore, the P14 PWM PST is particularly suitable for use on heatsinks and radiators. More Efficient Technology The motor is powered by a Neodym-Iron-Boron-Magnet, which allows the P14 PWM PST (1.44 W @ 1700 RPM) to run much more efficiently than its predecessors (F14 PWM PST: 3.6 W @ 1350 RPM). This saves energy and lowers the coil temperature without comprimising the performance. 200 to 1700 RPM (0 RPM <5 %) regulated via PWM With a wide range of regulation and the PWM Sharing Technology (PST), the P14 PWM PST fan speed can be controlled synchronously with all your other fans together. This keeps noise at a minimum while ensuring maximum cooling performance when needed. High Quality Bearing Thanks to a unique technology developed in Germany, friction within the bearing is reduced and greater efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development as well as less bearing noise, which means you can enjoy a longer service life from your fan.",

                "reviewText": "These fans are a German design and feature a very smooth bearing that Arctic developed. I have noticed that when I power the system off these fans coast down over a much longer period than other non-Arctic fans in the case (the AIO cooler I used is a different brand). That is an indication that the Arctic fans (this model, at least) should have a pretty decent MTBF. They move a lot of air, I pretty much don\u2019t hear them, and I doubt I\u2019ll ever need to replace them before the system itself becomes obsolete.These fans plugged directly into the motherboard fan headers and effortlessly interfaced with the motherboard fan control (I used an ASUS motherboard, but I expect the fan headers follow an industry standard - so Gigabyte, MSI, ASRock\u2026 brand shouldn\u2019t matter for this feature). These are non-RGB, so one need not be concerned with RGB control. Personally, I was concerned that too much RGB would make my system more clown car than functional. So interface was plug and play - I literally did not need to do anything else. BIOS adjustments will work through the motherboard so customization of the fan control is straight forward. These should just go along with any configuration a user sets up. Simply leaving the BIOS at factory settings is also an option - the point being; install to the frame, plug into the board, and no other action is required on the fan itself.Installation was pretty easy as well. These use an ABS plastic frame in their design - its durable, yet has some surface pliability. The installation is simply to use the provided screws which will cut their own threads into the plastic. So, while installation is simple, one needs to take care not to over-torque - these are not steel. One downside of this is that a certain amount of care and dexterity is required to maintain a straight line while initiating the threads or the screw can end up a little crooked. Not a big deal, but just worth noting. In theory one may be concerned that over time the screws would work loose from vibration and the ABS would no longer be able to accept sufficient torque. But these fans are so well balanced that their operation is glass-smooth. So I doubt vibration will be a factor. Should I discover this to change however, I\u2019ll revisit this post. For now, these fans have everything where it counts; simplicity, effectiveness, silence and presumed service longevity. I\u2019m pretty happy with them.And all at a bargain price, too.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 4 boxes of these fans (20 total). I am using 18 of these on a WaterCool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator. There were NO infant moralities, every fan worked perfectly (it's what I expect). And they function well -- they are quiet, they are good as rad fans, draw very low power and the PWM control works surprisingly well. When all 18 are running at 500RPM, they are dead quiet. My dog quietly breathing is much more audible than 18 of these fans.I am using a fan hub to fan out a single PWM fan header to all 18 fans. To be clear, when using a hub, the motive power that spins the fans is the 12V provided to the hub by a SATA etc. connection, NOT by the fan header. From an engineering standpoint, the load imposed by the individual PWM fan input signals of these fans is low enough that that a single fan MOBO header can drive all 18 PWM inputs.The PWM fan speed control must necessarily be provided by the fan header to the fans in response to the CPU temp and the fan rpm signal. Intel has published a spec on the maximum load the fan PWM signal can impose. These fans impose *far* less PWM load. I don't know how many of these fans can be controlled by a PWM from a single fan header. No doubt, it will depend on the MOBO but CPU fan header on an Asus Rog Strix 790-E easily operates 18 fans flawlessly.Despite the low cost, Arctic has designed a highly functional, quality fan product. At about $8 per fan is it s a bargain. Definitely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so installed these in my Helios case and all is well, except the rear exhaust fan is starting/made a rattling noise since it was installed. (Using a Noctua Fan hub atm since I didn't want to use too many extensions to get fan wires where they needed to be) Will probably swap the rear fan with the extra (case uses 4 140mm fans, 3 front intake & 1 rear exhaust) and see if that one is also rattling a bit. Will probably be a bit on that since I don't want to pop zip ties on the rear of the case until I know whether I want to add ARGB strips to the case (and whether that'll force me to put an ARGB hub somewhere)OVERALL: I'd say these are vastly superior to the 140mm 3pin fans that my case came with and definitely seem a bit quieter and move more air. Only thing may be QC of parts since that rear fan occasionally rattle at 700/800RPM (according to mobo) and definitely rattles at full speed (boot/no PWM signal detected)Side note: the 3 pin 140mm fans that the Helios came with were probably a bit thinner, or these are a bit thicker, either way, the front fan bracket had to be finessed (bent some holders) to go in with these fans.UPDATE: No actually, the rattle was getting annoying and appearing at lower RPMs. Swapped for the 5th fan in the box and it's running nice and quiet now. So only the one fan had a bad hub/improper balance(?)",

La tecnologia PWM Sharing ha semplificato l'installazione, consentendomi di collegarle direttamente alle altre ventole del radiatore senza l'uso di porte o adattatori aggiuntivi.Tre di queste ventole sono state posizionate dietro al radiatore, garantendo una sincronizzazione perfetta grazie alla tecnologia PWM sharing, senza richiedere spazi o adattatori supplementari. Le restanti due ventole sono state collocate dietro al case per favorire l'espulsione efficiente dell'aria. Pur essendo consapevole che, essendo ventole a pressione statica, non sono ottimali per l'espulsione dell'aria, l'acquisto del kit da 5 \u00e8 stato economicamente vantaggioso.Dal punto di vista estetico, le ARCTIC P14 PWM PST sono nere, prive di fronzoli e luci, rendendole perfette per una sleeper build. La loro presenza discreta contribuisce a mantenere un'estetica pulita e senza distrazioni. Il livello complessivo di rumore prodotto \u00e8 notevolmente basso, e le ventole rispondono prontamente ai comandi PWM. Nel complesso, consiglio vivamente le ARCTIC P14 PWM PST a chiunque cerchi un sistema di raffreddamento potente, silenzioso e dal design sobrio per una sleeper build impeccabile.",
