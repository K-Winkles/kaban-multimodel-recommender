                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. EDIT: I changed my original rating from a 3 to a 5. I wrote to Asiahorse and Asiahorse\u2019s customer service was super fast to explain about this being a new product release and that they are addressing this problem. They also are sending me the cables I need free of charge. I must say I was very impressed with how quickly this was resolved.EDIT2: I\u2019ve included a video of my final build. Also pic showing the fan speeds and CPU temp at 1000rpm they are keeping my 5800X3D nice and cool. The fans are much quieter than my original ones and provide ample cooling as needed I haven\u2019t seen my the notoriously hot CPU go over 75C since the update even with the big Aorus RTX4080 Master running cyberpunk2077 on ultra setting. I definitely recommend these fans and this company.Pros: The fans are great and the ARGB infinity lighting goes perfectly with my AIO cpu cooler. With the ability to use both the PWM and ARGB functions of your motherboard they really are nice. They also are quiet with good lighting effects. The airflow is pretty decent keeping my 5800X3D well within limits even while running a good workload.Cons: they are individual fans that are implied to be used as single or as a daisy chained set but in fact they can only be used as a set. They only supply 1 special proprietary fan/ARGB cable. So you can only connect 1 fan as a single, the other 2 are useless without a way to power them. I\u2019ve spent an hour searching online and I haven\u2019t found anything close to the cable input they use.I hated to do it but I gave them 3 stars because they are nice, but they don\u2019t deserve a 4th or 5th with such a big problem that almost seems to be done intentionally forcing you to buy sets of 3 even if you only need 1 or 2 fans.Bottom line is if you\u2019re looking for a 360 fan setup this is a nice option but if you want to split them up there are far better options available for much less money.EDIT: I just noticed all of the 5 star reviews on this are from compensated reviewers.",

Easy to install and the simple power adapter allows all your fans to plug into one PWM and ARGB spot on your motherboard.Where this product falls short is if you want to use a single fan for rear exhaust or have a need for less than three fans, there are no extra power connectors to work with. It would be a shame to buy another 3 pack for just one fan and connector.",

I have a 3-pack of them as case fans, and barely hear them. By comparison, when the AIO cooler kicks in (different brand), it's 3 times louder. I'm going to buy another set of these and replace the AIO fans with them.They're well-made, solid white plastic, not flimsy at all. The infinity mirror effect adds a classy dimension to the whole thing.Only 1 cable to route, the other 2 fans daisy chain into the 1st one. HOWEVER, this is a problem if you want to split the set - you can only use 1 fan, the other 2 can't be connected.It's not a design flaw, it's something I should have considered before buying, but I want to point it out. If the manufacturer wants to make adapter cables to convert the proprietary daisy-chain plug to regular PWM + ARGB, that would be amazing.",
