It takes up 2 spaces and moves a decent amount of air that otherwise does not move fast. Unless this is the only option, avoid it. I got this from Microcenter for $9 bucks and it immediately went into the trash the moment my return window closed as its a $11 drive in fuel to go to the store!You could wire it up to 5 volts but that defeats the point of having this.IMO just go with some be quiet wing 2, they move a ton of air and are more than half the coast of high output noctua's.If you do need this and you do not care too much for the high pitch noise it makes, its a great fan, the quality is decent, and is a good $ for what it is if you get it for under $10 bucks.",
