            "\u2714MOST EFFICIENT SATA TO FAN ADAPTER IN 2019\u2714 Managing multiple fans from a single case input has become easier for you now. If your motherboard lacks fan interfaces, use this neat & tidy way to add fans & expand fan interfaces designed for 12 V 4-pin fan. This PWM hub SATA accurately controls fan speed, you can slow down & speed up the fans up to the maximum speed. You need to connect the SATA & the 4 pin at the same time to run multiple fans.",
            "\u2714PWM FAN CONTROLLER TEMPERATURE CONTROL\u2714 The CPU Port (red port), would be the only port that can be controlled by the operating system. The other 9 black fan ports CAN NOT be adjusted in speed and will copy the power level of what the red port is at. Please note 4 Pin fan speed can be adjusted by temperature control as well. 3 Pin fans may also be used but have no PWM function and will stay at it's fixed speed after inserting.",
            "\u2714INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION\u2714 Simple installation & easy configuration, this fan splitter will work even if only connected to the PSU with SATA connector. You just plug the board into the CPU fan motherboard connection & then SATA for power. It has EVA double-sided adhesive tape at the back of the hub to mount to the case or any flat place. You can fix the screw hole in the middle of the PCB to facilitate fixing to a part of the chassis.",
            "\u2714STEP BY STEP SET-UP\u2714 You will receive 1 hub & 1 PWM connector in your package. The PWM interface is connected to CPU fan interface on motherboard by PWM cable & the red interface is dedicated for CPU fan. Connect 1 fan to the red port on fan hub then connect remaining fans. You then need to connect the fan hub\u2019s PWM cable to the motherboard. Connect the power supply SATA cable to fan hub before you attach/stick it on the chassis.",
            "\u2714MONEY BACK PRODUCT WARRANTY\u2714 Our product is backed up by manufacturer\u2019s warranty so feel free to contact us for any query or information.

Note: to avoid speed measurement confusion, computer crash, a multi-way interface to expand the interface, only show one of the fan speed measurement! 3: power supply can be directly supplied by power supply, which can reduce the load pressure of the mainboard 4. Scope of use: applicable to 12V motherboard 3pin/4pin fans. [3pin fan can also be used, but the plug is running at full speed, because 3pin fan has no PWM regulating function] 5: the hub PCB board is equipped with 3M backing adhesive, which can be pasted in a smooth place. There is also a fixed screw hole (the product is provided with a 40CM long PWM temperature control cable). This product is PWM governor, the function is to expand the single motherboard four-pin port into multiple ports for unified speed adjustment, if your fan is a 3-pin fan, you can also plug in, but can not achieve PWM control speed!

Good buy.The red pin does not need to be connected to the cpu fan pin. I connected it to chassis pin (instructions says not to) as my cpu pin is occupied by aio but still got it working. My motherboard supports controlling chassis fan as well via software.",

                "reviewText": "I use a 360mm AIO cooler in two cases. In each case there is only one fan header which should control the pump, and one for the three fans. So this is the solution. I plugged the three fans into this, one must go to the red connector, plugged the SATA power connector in and plugged the speed sense into the CPU fan header. The only issue is finding a place in the case where there's a SATA power connector and a flat spot to stick the controller to. Worst case I could have just installed another modular SATA power cable, or a SATA extension I already have. Powered up the case and now all the AIO fans are controlled by the single CPU fan header. Don't use this for the pump, that needs to run at relatively high speed. If you run the pump at low speed it won't move the cooling water fast enough and you won't get good cooling.",

                "reviewText": "Bottom line: This board provides a capability to add fans for case airflow if your MB lacks multiple fan plugs. I broke the SATA power port off the board because I didn\u2019t have my thumb on it to hold it, but it still works. The instructions on the Amazon sale page are the only thing you get, so it\u2019s not a beginner friendly item. A few notes\u2026 the 4-pin to 2 pin cable works. Two pins carry power, which the board gets from the SATA connection because the motherboard fan plug won\u2019t power more than one fan. The other two pins are temp and (PWM) rpm control (rapid on/off switch). These are the only two wires the board needs. However, it\u2019s a \u201cdumb\u201d board so every fan you plug in to it will report (temp/rpm) and run (rpm) through the MB connection as a single fan because that\u2019s all it can see or monitor.",

I used to successfully connect three additional fans (all 3 pin, although 4 pic is recommended) + the CPU fan to the adaptor, adaptor itself connected to the CPU 4 pin fan pinout on the motherboard and powered by a sata connection. Seemed handier to me than using a molex connection or daisy chaining.",
