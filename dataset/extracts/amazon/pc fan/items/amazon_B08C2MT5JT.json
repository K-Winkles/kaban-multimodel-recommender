Have been building gaming PCs for 22 years and have used every major brand of fans and I'm pretty shocked at how well these are performing for the price point I wasn't expecting much at time of purchase and was just getting these to put in my new case design prototype for testing and to my surprise they are actually really good love the wireless remote it has so many features with multiple themes , speeds, brightness, and can even select the mobo rbg controller to run them all at a push of a button even with all fans at almost silent speed they are moving alot of air and couldn't be happier with making these my daily PC choice I highly recommend these and will purchase again in the future.",

                "reviewText": "They are definitely RGB fans but I was pleasantly surprised the controller was SATA powered and not molex. The complaint being a cheap kit is the controller and remote. Very intermittent control with the remote. Half of the functions worked. The bright side? I reached out to HI PC and had amazing customer service. They were quick to response and without hesitation helped diagnose and are sending a a replacement controller and remote. Great customer care for sure. Hassle free. Product is easy to install and the fans look great for the price.Update: got the replacement parts and everything works great!",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my computer and wanted to modernize with a little RGB so I picked up this kit. The lighting is even cooler in person then it lookjs in the pictures. It's hard to capture the color changing in a camera still shot but it's really cool. Fans have good cable length and control box was super simple to plug in and stick on. You can spend over an hour just playing with the different modes. The remote is easy to use and makes up for lack of motherboard support pretty well.Wish it had a magnet instead of an adhesive pad but I did peel it once to move it and it wasn't that harsh to pull off and it stayed put in the new spot. Whatever that pad is, it's almost as good as a magnet though I wouldn't try to move it too many times. I would definitely recommend this kit, especially if you are on a budget but even if not it's still worth a look. They made my 8 year old case look new again.",
