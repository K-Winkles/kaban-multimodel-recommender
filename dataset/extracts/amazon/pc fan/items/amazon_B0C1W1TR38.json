                "reviewText": "I bought this to use an external fan to help pull hot air out the back of my computer near the power supply, and it works very well. There are several useful ways to use this thing. You could use it to help pull hot air out of the top vents of your monitor, or use it to cool a cable modem by pulling hot air out of it's vent holes. Those things can get very hot. Just a handy item. I am using it with a phone charger power adapter, which provides a little more power than a USB port does. But it's not necessary if you don't need that extra juice. A USB port will suffice. It will work with a 3 or 4-pin fan of various sizes.Feels like a well made product. Doesn't feel cheap at all. I like it and may even buy another one or two just to have around incase I were to need them at a later date.",
