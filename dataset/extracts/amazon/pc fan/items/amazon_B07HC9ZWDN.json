High Quality Bearing Thanks to a unique technology developed in Germany, friction within the bearing is reduced and greater efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development as well as less bearing noise, which means you can enjoy a longer service life from your fan.

                "reviewText": "I forgot to take photos *before* installing them but the fans are mounted to the top of my P400 case.I decided to get 2 140mm fans to replace the two 120s I had previously because I recently (about 5 weeks ago) I landed with an ASUS Dual OC 3060 Ti, replacing my much smaller in size MSI Gaming X 1660 Ti. With the new card, temps were hovering anywhere between 70\u00b0C to 78\u00b0C on some games and varying ambient temps. The below list are max temps reached during these games with my previous top 120mm fans and my current 3060 Ti:71\u00b0C Rainbow Six Siege78\u00b0C Apex Legends74\u00b0C DiRT Rally 2.075\u00b0C Monster Hunter World76\u00b0C Shadow of the Tomb RaiderAll games were tested for 45 minutes, max possible settings for each game on a 1080p 144hz monitor; Ray Tracing enabled for Shadow of Tomb Raider, Ultra setting. As mentioned previously, I have a Phanteks P400 case with a front-mounted NZXT X52 cooling a Ryzen 5 3600 paired with a 3060 Ti from Asus, the DUAL OC model and the two 120mm fans mounted at the top.These are my temperatures now with two Arctic P14 top-mounted fans:62\u00b0C Rainbow Six Siege64\u00b0C Apex Legends66\u00b0C DiRT Rally 2.068\u00b0C Monster Hunter World67\u00b0C Shadow of the Tomb RaiderBy no means were my previous temperatures bad as my GPU still performed below it's 83\u00b0C limit but there's real performance to be gained by dropping temps as much as I did; 14\u00b0C less on Apex Legends with the Arctic P14 fans, simply incredible and I can't explain how.I am no expert when it comes to airflow but I figured that now having a larger GPU in size, my old 120mm top-mounted fans were not exhausting enough hot air and a lot of it was recirculating within the case, driving my temperatures up. I'm running these new P14 fans at their max rated RPM of 1700 and the sound is personally not bothersome enough for me to slow them down.I hope my use case gives others an idea of what kind of gains you can get temperature wise and ultimately better performance by keeping your components cooler. In my case, this upgraded targeted specifically my GPU and it worked just as I expected.I will recommend these fans to anyone and everyone looking for super quiet, high performance fans at an incredible cost when compared to the competition.I will lastly like to thank Hot Deals 4 Less for the incredibly fast shipping from the US to Costa Rica, the fans arrived in excellent conditions. I will be happy to be a regular customer for them moving forward.",

Partially due to the high max RPM of this model.CONCLUSION:If you want great cooling performance and reasonable acoustics in your PC for the best possible value and you don't care about RGB, buy a full set of these and save yourself a bundle of cash. I have been an Arctic customer for years and the reason is that they have consistently provided the best cooling performance for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I got to say for a value product, the customer support for it was what I expected from a company that charges 4 times or better. It is hard to place blame for damaged products because of how many hands it touches from the factory to warehouse to reseller to the home. I bought this 5 pack really only needing 3 of them, however upon getting the package 1 fan was broken.I wasn't going to say to anything to amazon, because I figured I bought a value product and more then I needed so why go through the hassle. The manufacturer sent me a message through amazon in which I figured I would let them know, I was clear that normally I don't even leave reviews or reply especially when I have more then I need. The manufacturer however was insistent on replacing the broken fan, I took a picture sent it over and they sent me one probably faster then amazon got me the fans. I didn't have to go through a lengthy RMA, send the old fan back or any of the hoops a larger company makes you go through.This experience made me want to write a review. The product itself is a very decent fan, low noise, and good pressure as advertised. The support structure on the broken fan I had obviously had taken a blunt impact breaking the fan off of it's supports. The customer support was amazing, I would certainly buy from them again just because of that.",

                "reviewText": "As other reviews say, these fans do have a particular resonance at certain speeds but I have already gotten used to it. It's a different whir than my previous fans, but since they were dying or temporarily replaced with 120s, these new 140s ones are obviously preferable. I really only notice the sound when I first turn on my rig. I game with headphones on so not really concerned with noise anyway.With that out of the way, these fans are a great value and really move some air. Lack of PWM is irrelevant with my motherboard supporting DC fan control. I recommend that you check to see if you have DC option in your BIOS before buying.",
