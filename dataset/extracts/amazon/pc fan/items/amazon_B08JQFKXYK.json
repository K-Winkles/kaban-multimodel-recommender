However, I ran into the issue where the ASUS brand fans on the AIO would not fit in the fan hub. The fan hub is very well made to exacting measurements. The ASUS fans ARGB connectors are just slightly too fat to fit. The Master Fans connectors fit fine. Other issue is that some of the wires were too far from it and I'd need to get extensions to be able to connect them all. In the end, I didn't use the hub at all and used the motherboard supplied ARGB splitter that looks kind of like a squid. I had a second one from another build I just started and didn't need and also found that my mobo had a second ARGB port. I used the second squid for that. I can't comment on the functionality. For now, it's going into my drawer for when I need a fan hub.",

                "reviewText": "I have an iBuyPower PC from 2021 and the fans that came with it were terrible. Their fans are proprietary junk that has a six pin connector, making them next to impossible to find direct replacements to attach to their rgb controller. I had to replace every one of the 4 fans in the system TWICE OVER because they failed and developed a loud squeel(no hole to be able to oil them either). Every day, I\u2019d have to open the chassis up and stop the fan(s) and hope when the restarted, they wouldn\u2019t squeel. I finally had enough. I bought this to replace the proprietary fan controller and also for 4 cooler master fans.The install was surprisingly easy. I used the jRainbow 2 header on the motherboard and the same fan header the original controller used and everything fired right up and the MSI Center app saw the new controller and the rgb and fan speeds were then controllable, just like the original.I did keep the original controller in place(plugged into the jRainbow 1 port) to continue to power the motherboard and liquid cooling rgb leds and the MSI app sees both jRainbow 1 and 2 ports individually(giving me more rgb flexibility than I had with just one controller)Overall, this worked great for me on my Z490-A Pro MSI motherboard. Now, no more sqeeling fans!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this controller to help control my fans more so with their ARGB than PWM but was nice to have both, and seeing as i had 7 ARGB PWM fans and most controllers only supported 6 or less and looked very cheap this one stood out.Comes with a magnetic back(not the strongest in the world considering the weight of the cords connected to it and itself) but also is provided with the option of velcro sticky pads if wanted(was a nice touch which i didnt use)This controller works with both 3 and 4 pin ARGB fans but not 4 pin PWM fans which was great as i had 3 3 pin and 4 4 pin fansAll fans work perfect with Aura sync and controls followed the speed of my CPU fan(motherboard had a CPU output port which works great because my cpu fan wire was to short to reach the controller which is what was the recommended way to install)",

                "reviewText": "So to those who said the fans are too loud\u2026 before I thought of sending it back, I looked up as to why. Simply put, it\u2019s because of the BIOS settings. I changed the mode from DC to PWM in the Hardware Monitor (which that is what the connector attached to the MOBO is), adjust it to all the fans that applies, and bam the fans are quieter again. Hope this helps!",
