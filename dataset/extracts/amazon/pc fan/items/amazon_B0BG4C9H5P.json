The fan is very nice computer fan type, for which there are many standardized screens and mounts(+). I was able to get a very professional looking installation.(+). The fan has a standard 120v plug and fan speed dial, which is key\u2026no wiring or voltage step-down to 5.5v required(+). The fan speed is incredible at the top end. I probably only needed one of these as the highest setting just pushes a lot of air, maybe too much. (+). But the noise at the top speed is too much (-). I set the fan to mid speed and used 2 fans instead, for a quieter service. FYI. But I would recommend this product as it\u2019s quality.",
