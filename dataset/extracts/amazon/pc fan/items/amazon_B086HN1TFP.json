                "reviewText": "**EDIT** 18 Months later and the first set as shown in the photos are still going strong, quiet, and bright. Actually back to buy a few more for another build. I also used their ARGB fans.. equally as good.Got introduced to the SickleFlow v2 fans when I bought their also recently released version 2 240mm aio. The fans are super quiet and the RGB is nice and bright. I was not planning on doing the whole case with them, but I was so impressed that i bought 4 more to replace my intakes and rear gpu radiator fan. At $14 a fan.. I am extremely impressed!! I even bought an extra to keep on the shelf. Why not at that price point.They are super quiet and even at 1800rpm, of course they will make some noise, but its not irritating like the EVGA fans I just took out. These are waaaay better. They also have rubber on the corners where you screw them in to help eliminate vibrations.The fans RGB connections are also setup that you can daisy chain them if they are in close proximity and then have a single RGB run to your header on the MB or a controller. Nice touch!The cables are also braided.. these do not look, feel, or function like $14 fans. I will be putting these in my future builds! As you can see, nothing but good things to say. I will be back if I run into issues with them over prolonged use.Case is a Cooler Master NR400 w/ ODD... guess I am team Cooler Master now. Wasn't planning on that, but the quality at their prices is unbeatable.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Cooler Master 212 and later EVO coolers for years. I realize they aren't strong enough for real gaming systems, but for my needs they work wonderfully well. I don't really need a second cooler, but I like knowing that if one conks out I have some redundancy. And while I'm on the subject, the new V2 version of the cooler, though at $45 is long gone from the always-on-sale-for-$20-$25 days of a few years ago, is a delight to install, sooooooo much easier than the old model, both in terms of getting it right and not needing a 3rd hand.I bought this fan just because it matches the one that comes with the cooler. When I built my previous system (10 years ago) Cooler Master was selling 120mm \"Excalibur\" fans and I loved them. I used them for everything, as they moved a lot of air (if run at 100%) with reasonable noise, and still moved a lot of air if you turned them down (I used them in 3-wire mode) just a bit, and over the 10 years my old sysytem has been running with 7 of them, I just recently replaced one of them. I'm sorry they stopped making them but I seem to have been the only person who liked them.Anyway, for $10 for the black version of this fan, it seems like a good deal to me. They work well, move a nice amount of air (when required, they are being used as PWM CPU cooler fans) and I expect them to hold up well.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got a Hyper 212 RGB Black Edition. I liked it, but the fan was beginning to act up and make weird noises. Since the Hyper 212's default fan is actually an obsolete model that is no longer produced, I got the 4-pin RGB version of this instead. It performed noticeably better on my 5800X - about a 2 degrees C drop - while being significantly quieter. In addition, the frosted LED effect complimented my Trident Z RAM very well. I liked it so much I got another and used it to replace the stock exhaust fan that came with my case.Only docking 1 star because the price has since gone way up, and it isn't necessarily worth it unless they're $12 or less. At the time I got the fans, they were $8 each after a rebate was applied, which is a very good price for these.",

                "reviewText": "I have the cooler master hyper 212 black edition cooler for my CPU (Ryzen 9 5900x) and wanted a push/pull instead of just the one fan the hyper 212 came with. Went on Amazon, found this cooler master SickleFlow fan to do my push/pull and it works perfectly. The hyper 212 comes with a splitter for the CPU power socket on the motherboard so I was able to plug my SickleFlow into the splitter alongside the hyper 212 fan and it works great. The hyper 212 also comes with mounting gear that allows for you to install another fan as I did, so this worked out great for me. The RGB cords on these 2 fans daisy chain off of each other too because the SickleFlow has a splitter on its RGB cord that allows for you to daisy chain with another fan while you can plug the other side of the cord into an RGB socket on your motherboard. I do not plan on overclocking this CPU so that is why I went ahead and did this, so I can maximize the best possible airflow for it. Highly recommend you buy this fan if you are doing what I am doing. Great little setup and a good price too. Remember though, this is an RGB fan and not an ARGB. For those of you who do not know what that means it just means you cannot adjust the individual LED bulbs on this fan. All of the LEDs are the same color as one another.",
