(IF YOU NOTICE THE HUB IS ONLY POWERING YOUR FANS AT HALF YOUR DESIRED SPEED IT IS LIKELY BECAUSE YOU PLUGGED IN THE MOLEX UPSIDE-DOWN.) when the molex is plugged in the wrong way it will only deliver around 5-7 volts of power to your fans. Just make sure the beveled edges of the molex connector line up with the port on the hub, that way your fan curves work correctly and you can get the full 12 volts.

                "reviewText": "The fan hub works as advertised. As other reviews mention, the adhesive on the back isn't terribly sticky, but it's adequate to keep the hub in place. I ended up using the adhesive and also a mounting screw to the chassis of my computer to secure the controller. Also worth mentioning is that the only fans rpm that will be read on your motherboard is the one plugged into the red port. All the other fans will simply copy the commanded pwm duty cycle from the motherboard. Overall, well worth the couple bucks to take the current load off of the motherboard fan headers.",

                "reviewText": "Used this as I was running low on fan headers on the motherboard (had 4 attached, planned on adding 5 more).Read the instructions and had 1 fan on the slot marked \"CPU\", plugged in molex, slotted the included PWM cable to between the PWM slot and a motherboard fan header.All the fans work, and no issues on having the motherboard read the fan speed connected \"CPU\" slot, but I was not able to adjust the speeds (tried through BIOS, speedfan, and some other fan monitoring software)-- all the 4-pin PWM fans are read, and sound like they are, at 100% / 1700 RPM.Tried connecting each fan individually to the motherboard and I can adjust them when connected that way, so seems to be an issue with the fan controller, so giving it a 3 for having some of the stated functionality working.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this Installed so far for about 3-4 months now and have had no issues. install was easy. I wish it had a plastic cover but you could easily make one. my advice is to not plug in your CPU fan to the cpu fan port on this device and instead use and extension from another fan header that way your fans speed can be controlled separately from the cpu fan which tends to ramp up and down. yes you could set you fan speed to not do this but for me I like to keep a constant flow of fresh air in and out. If I'm taxing my cpu, my cpu fan can ramp up when it needs too. for 10$ its well worth it the standard corsair only has 6 ports. so you would need 2 controllers 2 setups and 2 times the amount of cables to run. of and they're 2 times as expensive. great easy way to control a case that has way more fans then it needs",

                "reviewText": "If you are reading this review then you are accustomed to having electronics devices such as this either hit or miss. I bought this originally with the intent of just having it sit at full power (this can be done as long as you don't plug the unit into the motherboard via the provided 4 pin). Originally I was very satisfied with this unit and it did a great job at powering the fans I put in (I am running 6 fans). However upon monitoring the sound levels I noticed that it varied far more than normal. It was at this point I noticed that it looked like the fans would suddenly slow and then speed right back up. Seeing as there was now real PWM functionality this shouldn't have been the case. When I went to resecure the connection and turned the computer back on. It seemed to have even less power going to the unit. At this point I decided to no longer mess with it and go to my old fan hub (which unfortunately doesn't sit as flat but that is fine). Don't buy this hub, it is not reliable.EDIT: Upon retesting the supposed dead unit (curiosity can really drive you) I was able to get a better connection and it seemed to power fan and work better. However, the verdict remains on if it can reliably deliver power to fans. I will update if anything improves but I can't guarantee that this will happen.",

                "reviewText": "It's an age-old problem. Motherboards tend to have (at least on the budget end of things) one or two chassis fan connections, and my case has three. Instead of making a spaghetti monster of splitters, I decided to try this hub and leave room for adding two more case fans town the line.I'm on my second hub - the first one arrived very bent and broken. But number two arrived in good shape. The connection to the motherboard works great via the 4 pin cable, and the adhesive on the back was fine for attaching the hub inside my case.I haven't been able to really test the PWM functions of the hub, since the fans in my case are 3 pin DC controlled, but they all power up just fine, and it seems to relay voltage levels to the fans just fine. So that part of the description seems to be accurate. I suppose I could have routed the CPU fan through it, but I opted to leave that connected directly to the header on the motherboard.If you're looking to add a bunch of case fans, and don't like the idea of connecting splitters to splitters to do so, this is an inexpensive option that also helps you manage your cables.Cheap. Simple. Works. 3 or 4 pin. It's a thumbs up from me!",
