The fan assures extremely efficient cooling, even with increased air resistance. Therefore, the P12 is particularly suitable for use on heatsinks and radiators. Lower Power Consumption A 10 \u00b0C lower motor temperature roughly doubles the life span of a fan. The new ARCTIC motor has a four times longer service life through its low coil temperature. High Quality Bearing Thanks to an alloy/lubricant combination developed in Germany, friction within the bearing is reduced and greater efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development as well as less bearing noise, which means you can enjoy a longer service life from your fan. Highly Efficient The ARCTIC P12 Case Fan is the ultimate PC-Cooler solution.",

                "reviewText": "I tested it at 5 VDC and 12VDC. It is nice and quiet.There is a link to the Arctic website, about halfway down the page of this item, that says \"User Guide (PDF)\".When you follow that link, it just shows you a scan code or URL to get to the P12 manual page. At the Arctic site, under \"Controlling A Fan / In a DYI Project\" there is a chart showing that the max RPM at 12VDC is 1000RPM. I have posted that chart here. Apparently that graph is not the correct one (read test below).Then I stuck it on my Gigabyte Aorus B450 motherboard and found that the speed sensor is not working, although I could throttle the speed up and down manually using the BIOS utility. Probably won't return it because I really do not need the tach sensor.I hooked it up to a ATX power supply and read the RPM with a laser photo tach.Result at 12V: 1840 rpm. So, I believe the 1800rpm rating.I also tested it while used in a solder fume extractor and it worked okay, although I do not have the activated filter installed yet.",

I think going forward, all future motherboards should have minimum of 4 + CPU fan headers.. Anyways, anyone buying this consider buying a SATA or MOLEX to 3/4pin fan adapter. It's cheap and solved my problem. These fans are so easy to install and work as intended. They're honestly quiet, most times I'm playing games or listening to music so either loud speakers or headphones on. I don't hear them. As for helping the temp of my CPU and GPU? I noticed -15 to -20 for CPU and -10 for GPU temp when gaming compared to my old setup. I am using 6 of these fans, 3 on the front for sucking, 2 on the top to blow out and 1 in the back to blow out. The side with sticker is sucking side. There is an arrow imprinted on the fan if you're unsure which way the air blows, look for it.",
