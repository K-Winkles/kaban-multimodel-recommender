The lighting is very nice but again not able to the patterns not having a mobo program. The controller has no way to change, it seems to just be a hub to connect and fire up.As for Coolermaster itself, it appears this company has fallen off the face of the earth, absolutely no way to contact them or ask questions. All links to them is non working!...IMHO this company no longer exists!! So, with that said, I highly doubt I will buy any CM products, except for fans, which are easily replaceable and not a major expense, but for other products....NO WAY at this moment!",

I feel like this product could have been way better if either both sides looked the same, or there was options to make 2 intake and 1 exhaust. (When facing the aesthetically pleasing direction, it\u2019s exhaust) If there is please let me know.Other than a backwards fan, looks awesome!",
