                "reviewText": "I've got a couple of places where I need some more dedicated airflow, but a box fan is not as graceful as I want. I got this fan array to build into a cluster enclosure to keep air clean and cool. I'll be mounting the switch control on the outside, along with a master power switch and Ethernet drop jack, so that the cluster enclosure can be like an appliance. But so far outside the box it gives some good airflow without too much noise (it'll be in the garage, with some filtration to keep dust and leaves out).",
