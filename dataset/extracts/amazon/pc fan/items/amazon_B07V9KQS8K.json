I was trying to spend as little as possible while still providing him a pleasurable gaming/computing experience. These met my needs. They look and feel cheap. I wouldn't recommend them if they are going to be in a situation where they are being handled or installed and uninstalled regularly, but if you are just going to slap them in a low end build and leave them alone, they are perfect. They move plenty of air if you are using them in a lower powered build like I did and you really can't even hear them run at idle speeds.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure what all the negative reviews on these are about, but I'm very satisfied with them. I run a very high end gaming system (Ryzen 9 3900X, RTX 2080ti, 32GB DDR4 3600Mhz). I bought these fans because my PC was running very hot with the CPU reaching temps of 90 degrees celsius and my GPU hitting the max temp I allow in my profile at 84 degrees no matter what game I was playing. The case previously only had one fan on the back with two empty fan spaces at the top of the case (not including the 3 fans mounted to the AIO radiator). It was scary hot. I installed these fans in a pull configuration on the top of my case (pulling air out of the case) and my temps dropped by 25-30 degrees in all previously mentioned areas. Not only that, the different connectors they come with make them compatible with pretty much any system. They are also dead quiet.",

I believe the 3rd (yellow) lead is for speed control. So you can hook one up with the 3 lead connector to the motherboard but if you are out of case fan ports (which I was) you have to get power from the first fan and then you can only use the 2 lead connector. So the second fan's speed will be static.",
