When trying to adjust the glue stick on the back of the unit, it came loose and pulled one of the soldered connections off. It became apparent that this is poorly made and not worth the money. Lesson learned and I bought a hard circuit hub.",

I used it on an ITX motherboard that had a liquid cooling loop with a few fans but the motherboard only had 2 fan headers. The only major downside I ran into was that my first time placing it wasnt as straight as i wanted and when i tried to adjust it the double sided tape on the back fell right off of the control sticking to the case better than the board. I ended up using some tape I had lying around.",
