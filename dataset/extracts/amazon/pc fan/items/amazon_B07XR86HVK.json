There are a lot of really good fans available, but if I had to pay $60 to $70 for fans, I'd put the money into a new case with modern features.I don't know anything about the Arctic brand, but these fans work as good as the previous fans I had which were Enermax Marathon. These fans are quiet and I've had no issues with overheating, I game on this system and it has an i9-12900K and Arc A770. If the fans last 5 years, they'll outlast the useful life of this system.The \"PWM sharing\" feature is just marketing for a built-in Y-connector that lets you daisy-chain fans together. It did allow me to remove a separate Y-connector from my PC, so I guess it was useful.",

Great deal. 2 fans went in without a hitch, secured easily and are very quiet. My power source fan is the only thing I hear as it's about twice the size. Sound wise, it's as if I never installed them at all. They seem like they push a respectable amount of air. Just what this old machine needed. Now as soon as I get the OS re-installed, it joins my XP, WIN 8 and Ubuntu machines in the guinea pig server so I can practice attacking it. CEH style that is. (Just need to set up a virtual server now with 2008 in there.) Excellent deal, as long as they hold up. I would recommend them. The only very minor issue is that others said that they came with rubber bumpers to keep them even quieter. I didn't get any bumpers, but they mounted up tightly and there is no danger of rattling etc. Satisfied, so far. Time will tell but 5 stars for now. If it changes, I'll let y'all know.",

                "reviewText": "These fans are untouchable for the price!Yes, there are 80mm that push more air, but they cannot do so as quietly as these run.I used these to replace a set of 4 Raidmax green led fans in my gaming PC. I was using my old case, opticals, and PSU to build a new PC, and decided to replace all of the fans during the build as a couple were no longer running properly. I used four of these and a 120mm Artic fan in the front of the case.I wired the 120 and 2 of the 80's to the motherboard. These fans do not come with 4-pin connectors and I had no adapters on hand, so I had to splice to 4-pin connectors to connect directly to the PSU.When I finally powered up the new machine, I freaked out thinking none of the fans were running. I'm accustomed to being able to hear the constant hum of 5 fans all the time, yet i could hear nothing. I ran my hand beside and behind the case and sure enough, just as much air being pushed as my noisy $20ea Raidmax fans used to push.I'm a bit saddened to lose the cool factor of my glowing led fans, but these do the job just as well and much more quietly.",
