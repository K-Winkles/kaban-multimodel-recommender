Absolutely silent, my Mac fans are louder than this and that is saying something because I f-ing love my mac. I like the ridges on the blades, it seems to help with cooling. I bought this to replace the old, loud stock fan on my spare PC a Dell Optiplex 780 SFF with Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650. I used Prime95 to stress test the CPU at full load and used Hardware Monitor to check the temps before and after the fan replacement. Under full load, it dropped my max temps a whopping 14 degrees from 76F to 62F and I never heard the fan. The OEM fan sounded like a jet engine at full load, which was completely unbearable.FYI if buying for a Dell, the plugs on the fans are different and Dell couldn't just do a straight pin out they had to twist the wires (typical Dell) so slight modification is necessary to plug into the board of the small form factor. You can just look under the sticker on both fans to figure out the correct wiring order, the boards are labeled thankfully but be careful you can fry your board or start a house fire!",
