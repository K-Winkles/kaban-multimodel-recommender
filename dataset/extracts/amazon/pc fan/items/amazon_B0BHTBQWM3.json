                "reviewText": "I've been using this particular 120mm fan for a couple weeks now and honestly it does its job exceptionally well! No RGB, nothing too spectacular, just a working fan that helps balance the air pressure for your system. I am currently using this as an exhaust fan, top side and it doesn't make any noise while spinning in my PC. Perhaps the reason for it being so decently quiet is the fact the average speed is lower than my front and bottom fans, highest it can do is 1300 RPM. Pushing this fan at its top speed made no noticeable noise besides the sound of air being pushed around, or inside the case. I once set this up as a front fan as well and it did great in that position too. So whether you want this as exhaust or intake, I think it won't let you down on either side. It is a fairly simple design and its plug-and-play ready. A great comparison would be the ASUS XF120mm, which I do own, and the only difference between the two is the ASUS is 500 RPM more, and $15 more. Both are great and can work together fine, but the Corsair seems easier to pick here. In the end, I just like this fan and it's still in my case as I make this review.",
