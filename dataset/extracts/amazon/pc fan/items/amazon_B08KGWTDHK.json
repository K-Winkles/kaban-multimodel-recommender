I bought these silicone mounting \"screws\", and while they were a little hard to get through the screw holes at first, but they've been holding tight for about a year-and-a-half.",

I couldn't be happier with this product.Nearly all fans, where the mount is not just a hole, will slide down to the rail to the lowest point in most cases. I didn't find this to be a problem though. I'm extremely happy with the outcome, I just can't believe it made such a difference, well worth it.",
