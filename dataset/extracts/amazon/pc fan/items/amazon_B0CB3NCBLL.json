I bet if you connect them to a higher voltage they would move more air but be louder. They are well made. The only real issue I can see is there is no protection for the cord where it comes out of the fan. With the USB end, you cannot get heat shrink around it to help. So to protect it from breaking I added liquid electric tape. Ugly but works.",

The YouTube DIY projects I saw used a fan like this hot glued to a perforated tube, but I'm just keeping it simple/trying the fans \"as is\" before I try to get all craftsy/make something more inconvenient to pack along on rides.",
