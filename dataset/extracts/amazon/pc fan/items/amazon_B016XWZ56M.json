The perfect choice for silent home and office PCs as well as gaming and multimedia systems. Silence-Optimized Fan Blades Thanks to its surface-optimized fan blades the airflow is enhanced, noise-generating turbulences are minimized and the air pressure is increased. This feature is the key to effective cooling. Variable Fan Speed Function Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) allows compatible 4-pin controllers - including those built into many motherboards - to intelligently vary the speed and thus the noise level of the fan. With PWM your system can ramp up the cooling when it\u2019s needed, or operate in maximum quiet mode when it\u2019s not. This feature especially recommends the fan for heat sinks and radiators.",

Two are front intake, one top intake, and one exhaust fan.For now it does the job and the fans match my Dark Rock 4 Pro. I just built my new rig at the beginning of the year and the temps have been cool. We will see how it does in the upcoming summer months.",

                "reviewText": "I have extremely good luck with Be Quiet CPU coolers (air cooling using a heatsink/fan) and case fans. I just built a brand new system (its been about 6 years). So a Fractal Torrent case, Be Quiet Slim cooler (180W) on a 7800x3d. I added this fan to the back of the case to help pull air out. Be Quiet fans are as the name implies \"quiet\" and you just do not hear them. This is the perfect fan for the rear of the case that I needed!",

There is zero noise and works exactly like it should. It moves more then enough air and installation was extremely easy. I will be using this brand of fan for all my builds. The seller was quick and friendly with all questions and answers. Will buy from them again.",
