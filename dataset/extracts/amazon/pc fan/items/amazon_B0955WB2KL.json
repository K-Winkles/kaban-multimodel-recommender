The stock fans were fine, but I wanted to try some higher quality fans to upgrade the cooling. Installation was... well, easy. They're just fans and I already had a daisy chain for my other fans. The hard part was getting the metal clamps on the cooler, but that's normal.The fans are super quiet, even at max speed. My gaming temps dropped by around 10c. I used to get 80-90 degrees (don't worry, it's a 7900x which is designed to stay at 95c). With these fans, I'm getting around 70-80c! If it goes under a big load while loading a game, it did get into the 90s for a split second, but otherwise these fans keep my pc at a much cooler temp while gaming. They look great too!

                "reviewText": "The ASUS XF120 fans really are one of the better, quieter fans in my collection of PC fans.For a couple of weeks, I have been using a pair of these ASUS fans in comparison to other brands I collected in the mail; Noctua, Arctic, Corsair, etc. The initial goal was to find what most people are buying these fans for, air pressure and silence, and in the end, these ASUS XF120 do indeed deliver the results!At first, I made my quick doubts, only purchasing them for the half-off sale that lasted a week or two, believing the 'whisper-quiet' sales pitch would be exaggerated. I am glad to be wrong, after setting these up after some comparisons, these do make some noticeable changes, good changes in air and noise. I put my doubts to rest and aim to use these as my final fan setup.To those on the fence about these, I wouldn't stress on buying these fans with doubts in mind as I have. These do make promises in performance, making my Celsius temps sustainably lower during gaming and cool idle temps too. In my experience and opinion, these make great exhaust fans for 120mm sizes, as the heat is rushing out at faster rates, keeping it cooler inside as air going in. They do great as intake as well, but I mix things up with another brand for now. I bought these at a lower cost than base price, being $15 individually, which is very well worth it. I hope you and everyone finds these at the similar price point!",

I used 6 of these non RGB fans for the top and bottom of my case to create a chimney style air flow. I also use an NZXT Kraken Z73 and 1 additional NZXT RGB fan for the rear. They stay nice and quiet at all times and keep the air flowing. Oh, and install was super easy. I used the screws personally but it comes with rubber screws also if you prefer.I deducted one star for the price. 30 for a non RGB fan is very high but at the same time they are the best. Even still though, its a fan.",

I personally thought the 15 bucks per fan was too much, but after getting them in, I am sold on buying quality fans.",

                "reviewText": "Realmente es un ventilador muy silencioso con un buen empuje de aire, ya sea en cuanto al flujo o a la presi\u00f3n. El empaque est\u00e1 genial y los accesorios incluidos tienen una gran calidad. Algo que me pareci\u00f3 un detalle a tomar en cuenta, es el largo del cable, de unos 40 o 50 cm. Por otro lado, tambi\u00e9n tiene una toma doble para usarlo en disipadores o para conectar 2 a un s\u00f3lo puerto de la MB. Ambos cables est\u00e1n cubiertos por una malla fina y suave. \u00a1Me gustaron! :DQuiz\u00e1 el precio sin el descuento sea un tanto alto, s\u00f3lo un poco m\u00e1s bajo que un Noctua y, aunque estos tienen una estupenda calidad, sigo considerando a Noctua como superior. En fin, con ese descuento, por supuesto comprar\u00eda m\u00e1s.",
