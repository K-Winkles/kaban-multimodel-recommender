                "reviewText": "These fans are ok. I have ordered a total of 4 now because they are by far the cheapest fans that aren't total garbage. They seem well made and like theyll last a long time, they are as easy to install as any other fan and they are surprisingly quiet.The reason for the 3 star review is that they just aren't powerful. They move very little air, although its obviously better than having no fan at all. Also, they only have 3 pins instead of 4. I would say if you only have a few bucks to spend on fans then these are a totally workable solution. Otherwise, if cooling is important to you, spend a few more bucks and get something with 4 pins that can move more air. I ended up replacing 3 out of 4 of the fans i bought because they move such a small amount of air.",
