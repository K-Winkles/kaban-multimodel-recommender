                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Cooling my modem and router",
                "reviewText": "My last cable modem up and died after just one year, I'm pretty sure because it got so hot all the time. It was a modem+router so extra hotty-hot-hotness from all the circuitry packed into one case. My son thinks this is sort of normal lifespan for routers and modems - he expects only 3 to 4 years. Well I got 8 years out of one of my last modems and 10 out of the other (same modem, WTGS54 whatever that was, it was a very good modem for its time and I got more than enough throughput from it for my needs, including streaming video, I was still running one up until 2 years ago).So *I* was shocked at its short lifespan (especially given the cost, over $200) even if he wasn't.There is just more electronics involved in these tasks, packed into less space, than the older modems. They are GOING to get hot. So in order to keep that from happening again I bought this USB fan kit, comes with 2 fans hooked together, to replace the floor fan I had aimed at the new modem and separate router. I was getting some of these anyway to put on my LED grow lights to cool them (they will ALSO last longer if you keep them cool) so I took one of those and shoved it under the router (because its a flat design, give me vertical any day) and stood the other one up next to the cable modem (which is vertical).I've got them on low and they are cooling both devices very well. On low the router gets barely slightly warm, and the better design of the vertical case for the modem leaves it totally cooled down with this little fan. If I had it to do over I'd look harder for a vertical router as well, its easier to keep them cool. AND they take up a lot less space! I've got a bunch of old computer cases with fans going to waste, I will likely make some USB fans from all those old bits and pieces, but they are likely to be a lot louder. This fan is extremely quiet even on high. I can't hear it at all on low.Also these fans in particular are optimized for humid environments so I wouldn't use anything else in my grow room. A lot of people use the other dual fan kit with the larger fans but they are using them to move air over microgreens to cut down on mold and fungi, I don't have that problem, I just need to cool the lights to improve their longevity, so I'm trying these smaller fans (take up less headroom over the lights, giving me more space under the lights because I can move them further up).I highly recommend cooling your router/modem/game console whatever electronic devices you have sitting around generating heat with some kind of fan, and these are very quiet, easy to assemble (as in plug them in), and very effective. I've seen some people insist that you shouldn't do this because it might \"blow dust into the case\" - where do these guys live, in the middle of death valley? LOL! Just do it. I've had a floor fan blowing across my very very ancient laptop to keep it from overheating for about 5 years now (even laptop coolers can't cool it enough) and its still going strong. I can even play (very very old) games on it still. Heat will kill your devices WAY faster than whatever tiny specks of dust these fans probably won't blow into the cases anyway.Also, if you have one of those stupid refrigerator closet things where they've built an enclosure all the way around the fridge, that is trapping heat and shortening the life of your expensive stainless steel fridge - you can use these fans to draw hot air out of that too (though I'd go with the larger version for that). Personally I'd tear that crap out but failing that, install these in a side or back wall and pull that heat out of there. Your fridge will thank you. Your bank balance will be the better for it over the long haul.",

                "reviewText": "RE: AC Infinity AI-MPF80A2 Quiet Dual 80mm USB Fan for Receiver ...PURPOSE, FEATURES, & QUALITY: Bought this pair to keep an Onkyo receiver cooler in a partially enclosed cabinet. The fans' switch is also a nice feature. When opened the shipping box, impressed with the fans apparent build quality, especially at this price (~$16). My fans were pre-assembled, but apparently some have needed some assembling. Time will tell how durable/reliable they are over the years.ON-SITE FUNCTIONING: Tested the fans on an open table in a large room and could barely hear them and they still put out a decent breeze. So, placed the fans on top of the receiver towards the back, about 11 inches from the open-front-edge of the cabinet, angling them so the breeze flowed over most of the top vents of the receiver, placed the wiring, turned on the fans, and cranked up the volume on the receiver. The receiver stayed almost entirely cool, a substantial improvement from the level of pre-fan heat. The fans' breeze can barely be felt at the front-open edge of the cabinet, but it appears to be doing the job -- if you plan to place the fans much deeper into a cabinet, you might need a stronger fan. Since the fans are black and placed at the back of the receiver inside the cabinet, they are inconspicuous enough. (Photo of fans' placement attached)NOISE LEVEL of the fans in the cabinet: With the receiver off and the fans on, can hear the fans from a few feet away but not annoying or intrusive. With receiver on and playing any audio, I can't hear the fans at all. (Qualifier: I have some hearing loss, especially in one ear.)CONCLUSION: These fans are doing exactly what I needed at a reasonable price and their noise is not distracting where we have them located. So far, I'd definitely buy again for this purpose.-ADDED ON EDIT, 5/18/2015: For my purpose, these fans worked so well, I have ordered another pair of them for an Onkyo in another room.",

                "reviewText": "I did not realize that this is an inseparable set of 2 fans that cannot operate independently of each other. There is only a single USB plug. Maybe I missed that fact before purchasing but the Amazon listing does not make it obvious either.But, I was able to find a use for the set. I use one to cool my cable modem and the other to cool the router. Since they are located near each other, I can use this as a set. I am not sure how this will work out if one of the fans fail but will just cross that bridge whenever.The set of fans is well made. As mentioned, there is only one USB plug for the power source. I am using the USB jack on the router. But, there is a female USB jack built into the wiring harness for the fans that could be used to provide power to another device. I am not using that but it is a nice-to-have feature.The slide switch for the fans provides OFF, LOW, MEDIUM AND HIGH settings. On LOW, the fans are silent but do not move much air. On MEDIUM air movement is reasonable with only a slight sound. On HIGH there is a good air flow but the sound is clearly audible.This is a good product if you need a SET of fans that work as a pair. I will look for a single fan from this supplier since the fans work so well and the rubber feet make them even easier to use.",
