The fan assures extremely efficient cooling, even with increased air resistance. Therefore, the P12 PWM PST is particularly suitable for use on heatsinks and radiators. Extended Life Span A 10 \u00b0C lower motor temperature roughly doubles the life span of a fan. The new ARCTIC motor has a four times longer service life through its low coil temperature. 200 to 1800 rpm (0 rpm <5 %) regulated via PWM Thanks to the 4-pin connector, the RPM can be regulated in a broad spectrum via PWM. In this way, noise is kept at a minimum while maximum cooling performance is assured when needed. High Quality Bearing Thanks to an alloy/lubricant combination developed in Germany, friction within the bearing is reduced and greater efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development as well as less bearing noise, which means you can enjoy a longer service life from your fan.",

                "reviewText": "Hello Everyone! I\u2019m here to review the Arctic P12 PWM PST fans so please allow me the few minutes of your time to go over why these fans should be your next purchase!First things first, I want to make it clear that this is not my first rodeo with these fans, I\u2019ve actually purchased these fans many times, in all variations. For the sake of this review, I will be reviewing the White variants though the Black ones, ARGB ones, RGB ones, and opaque ones also apply to this review.The Shipping:I bought these not long ago, they took a couple days to get here but not long at all! I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived a few days early. I bought 6 with this order and they arrived in a bag with absolutely no damage.The Build Quality:These fans are (mind the language) sexy. They\u2019re classy and robust. The fans and housing are a little thicker than normal fans but they\u2019ll still fit in most cases. Actually, I found them extremely easy to install lol. While I forgot to take a picture of the fans themselves, I\u2019ll leave a picture of what they look like inside my case (I have 3 in the front, one in the rear, and 2 on each side of my cpu cooler).The Performance:These fans are legendary. I build computers for a living and I do a ton of research into parts that perform well without costing a fortune, I\u2019m happy to say that these fans are basically the crem\u00e9 of the crop when it comes to price to performance. These fans are just extremely high end fans with a budget pricepoint. I\u2019ve tested these against the \u201cworld renowned\u201d or \u201cgold standard\u201d Noctua A12s and Noctua P12s and I was completely astonished by what I saw. These fans perform very similarly to these enthusiast-level fans but are considerably cheaper! My aforementioned addition of these fans to my cpu cooler has provided me with an insight on how great these fans pair with budget coolers. I have a SE-224-XT White (which I also wrote a review on) which is a very budget cooler that pulls its own weight and thought it was great but felt off with only one fan, I replaced the stock fan with 2 of these (one on each side as pictured) and my cooler went from great budget cooler to absolutely phenomenal budget cooler. I won\u2019t get into specifics this time around because I went into full detail in the review of my cpu cooler but all you need to know is, my cpu cooler now performs like a higher end cooler because of the amazing performance that these fans provide. These fans are also extremely quietThe Value:As I\u2019ve said in the last section, these fans perform like higher end and higher priced Noctua offerings. These fans cost me $9 a piece and perform like they cost twice as much! The actual performance per dollar here is absolutely unbelievable.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars If you're looking for silence at a value, look no further",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this set to replace a number of fans that came included with my Fractal North case after noticing some unpleasant noise. Running these at 40% speed (~900 rpm) these are near silent and work well for my system at idle (R5 7600X / RX 6950XT). Even at 60-70% they push a good amount of air and help keep things cool under moderate gaming loads. I try to avoid the highest end on these fans since the noise is much more noticeable but they push a ton of air if you end up needing it. Your experience will vary based on your tolerance for noise and willingness to adjust fan curves. Personally, I love having the option for a nice silent curve with the option to max out under loads. All the other reviews praising the value of these fans aren't wrong. If you're not in the market for the likes of Noctua, these are your answer.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Arrived broken, but replacement within 24 hours satisfactory",
                "reviewText": "UPDATED: I ordered a 5-pack of Arctic P12 PWM PST 120mm fans. All 5 fans were broken on arrival. I sent them back in exchange for working ones, which Amazon delivered within 24 hours. The replacement fans are in perfect condition. I also ordered a single Arctic P12 Silent 120mm fan that arrived in new condition. All 6 fans passed some basic testing, and seem to be functioning normally. Very quiet! Once I get them installed, I'll do some more tests, and I will update this review.UPDATE: I've been daily driving these fans for a few days now. I switched to the Arctic P12s from the stock CUK fans that came with my CUK case. Those old fans were 1500 RPM, and were extremely loud, even at lower RPMs. My initial observation was that these P12 fans are much quieter, which is surprising, considering they spin up to about 1800 RPM. P12s seem to be moving air very effectively.I installed three of the P12 PWM fans in the front of the case as intake, and two of the fans in the roof of the case as exhaust, pushing air through a Lian-Li Galahad 240mm AIO radiator. I 3D printed some gaskets with TPU to fit between the fans and the radiator to maximize airflow efficiency. I installed the single P12 Silent (not PWM, locked at ~1000 RPM) as an exhaust in the rear of the case.I noticed that the P12 motors are much smaller than the motors of most other fans that I've used. This led me to some other observations: The first is that, because the motor is smaller, the fan blades can can be much larger and more efficient; they can scoop more air. Also, because the motor is smaller, it takes noticeably longer for the fan to spin up. This means that the change in fan noise volume is gradual, and therefore is inherently less noticeable and less disruptive. As far as performance goes, the P12s are managing my temps just fine, both moving the hot air coming from the air-cooled GPU out of the case, and also pushing air through the AIO, keeping the CPU cool; at 100% load and 100% fans, my overclocked Ryzen 7 3700x eventually settles in at around 86\u00b0C, and my overclocked EVGA RTX 3070 FTW3 settles in at about 77\u00b0C. Ambient temp is about 21\u00b0C. Not too bad at all. All of this is subjective, I know, but I figured I would note it.Some reviewers say that there is some vibration that is a audible at certain RPMs. I do hear it, it is there, but I really don't think that it is a deal breaker for me, especially considering the volume of the old fans that I am coming from. The P12s are very very quiet. I may 3d print more gaskets for the other 3 fans to see if that makes any difference in the noise. I'll report on that if I ever get around to it. For now, it's really not bothering me.Overall, I love them!",
