Vortex-Control Notches Noctua's signature Vortex-Control Notches split up trailing edge vortices and thus spread the fan's noise emission over a wider range of frequencies. This measure makes the fan sound more pleasant to the human ear.

Available in black, red, blue, white, green and yellow, these pads not only damp minute vibrations but also allow the fan to be colour-customised in order to coordinate it with popular build colour schemes!",

                "reviewText": "Notuca has done it again, producing a great product and this time at an even better price. This fan is very good in several categories with no real downsides.These are premium high end fans, so it vastly outclasses stock case fans.Material quality is great, just by touching it and holding it, the whole thing feels much more premium. Right out of the box it feels good.Noise level is great, but do be sure to set the fan curves in your BIOS, otherwise they will be running with a bit of noise on full RPM, which is overkill. They move so much air as it is, there is little reason to run them so hard and it creates an unneeded noise level. So do set a fan curve, for sure.Highly versatile! It\u2019s got great static pressure AND great airflow so you can comfortably use them on radiators or as case fans. Not all fans can say the same in terms of versatility.They do look alright to the eye, not some fancy RGB, but they are about functionality. Noctua has never been known for being flashy, but I highly recommend their anti-vibration pads for a nice accent as well as mitigating the vibrations for even less noise.Above all, the price point is what knocks it out of the park for me. There simply is no better fan for this price. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be outperformed, but anything that would do so would easily cost more than twice as much. Performs like a $20-$30 fan, yet cost nearly half that.Unless you are able to or willing to, shell out anything for PC performance I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t use these. For most enthusiast, this is certainly sufficient and effective. Unless you are some mega enthusiast with a 3 grand rig in the tower, this is great.Great for enthusiast looking for premium cooling without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "This fan runs well, but runs a little louder than other Noctua fans I've used (e.g. NF-F12). Lower speed noise level is good. It does not come with the nice rubber pads that their other fans do. Overall, still recommended when a slightly louder fan is tolerable, or you can stand to throttle this fan down a bit and only crank it up when necessary. If you want silence, I'd recommend you go with NF-F12 instead.",

                "reviewText": "I utilized these fans as case fans in a TrueNAS build featuring a Supermicro motherboard. I opted for these fans due to their high ratings and quiet operation. However, upon installation, I began receiving incessant alerts regarding fan warnings related to IPMI alerts for critically low fan speeds. Initially, I disregarded these alerts, but eventually decided to address the issue. It's important to note that this was not a fault of the fans themselves, but rather an issue with the Supermicro board and its default thresholds in the IPMI settings, which did not accommodate fans spinning at lower speeds.After conducting some research, I discovered the appropriate commands to resolve the issue. Specifically, I executed the following command via an SSH session for each Noctua fan I installed (please note I have removed my configuration information such as IP, username, password, and fan name):ipmitool -I lanplus -H <your_BMC_IP> -U <Your_Username> -P <Your_Password> sensor thresh \"<FAN_NAME>\" lower 100 200 300Following this adjustment, the alerts ceased, the BMC GUI indicated that everything was within the acceptable range, and I was no longer receiving alerts from TrueNAS.Returning to the product itself, the fans perform admirably, and I would unquestionably purchase them again for future projects.",

                "reviewText": "The quietness depends on the speed of the fan, which, in turns depends on how you set up the bios.At its lowest speed - whether in PWM mode or in DC - this fan is quieter but it produces an annoying hum. The hum is ever so slight, but, in a very quiet environment, it dominates the background noise made by three other fans: the CPU fan, the GPU fan and the fan in the power supplyThe three-pin steady-speed Antec Tri-speed that this Noctua replaced is at least as low-noise as the Noctua. It keeps the system at about the same temperature during days of non-gamer computer use. However, it produces no hum.I'm cured of the notion that a four-pin case fan with bios-regulated variable speed is better for every day computer use. In practice, my brand-new MSI board never drops the rpm of Noctua below 900 The Antec is steady at 1050 rpm.I should have followed the adage \"let not the perfect be the enemy of the good...\"Back to the 10-year old Antec. The one drop of machine-oil I added will let it to run smoothly for several more years.",
