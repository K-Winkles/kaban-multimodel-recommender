That being said, it is so close to being the correct size to mount in a 2.5\" or 3.5\" drive slot that I really don't understand why they couldn't make that an option. The included adhesive strip is pretty large and looks strong, but it came already stuck to the bottom, even though the bottom still had the protective film on it.Ultimately when I go to permanently install this I will probably take it out of the acrylic and 3D print a mounting bracket for it instead.",
