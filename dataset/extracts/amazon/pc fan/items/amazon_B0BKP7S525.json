These fans are simply incredible, 1500RPM is more than enough if you intend to use them as system fans, They are completely quiet, I have my PC sitting on my desk about 20 inches away from my head and they are silent.The move PLENTY of air even at 25% I tested this buy putting my hand over the fans which you shouldn't do. I have 3 of them on the bottom of my case acting as intake, they do so well that my GPU fans stay idle most of the time even in this hot summer we're experiencing 2023. I do appreciate that NO warm air builds up in my case thanks to all 4 fans.The price for the 3 pack is great although I wish they had a 4 pack option as I had to buy this +1. Quick suggestion I suggest getting a fan HUB for the ARGB just incase your MOBO does not have enough connectors, I think you can daisy chain the fans together in that scenario but I didn't test that, I just got pretty sweet and easy to install fan hub by \"XMSJSIY\" an $11 fan hub.",

I do plan on upgrading to Corsair fans in the future, but these helped save money on my initial build. 100% Recommend if you need good fans and plan on upgrading them latter.",

                "reviewText": "Shipping was ok, took around 2 weeks for me to receive them in Singapore. They work as intended, no defects. Fan and Argb cables can be daisy chained. Argb cable can be connected to standard argb headers on the motherboard or controllers and then we can control their lighting via software in windows. Airflow was average, not anywhere near the highest airflow fans on the market. I bought 6 fans and used 5 of them to fill out my hyte Y60 case.All in all for the current price less than $20 usd for 3 fans, it is amazing value. I would love to see anyone find another decent argb fan that can beat this in value.",
