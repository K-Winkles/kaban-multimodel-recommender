                "reviewText": "Got these fans and was able to install them into my PC with little to no issues, after installation I tested them. At full speed these fans are pretty loud but do push alot of air for intake or exhaust. I usually leave fans on Full Speed while gaming which if using a headset with decent noise cancellation you can barely hear them and when you are just hanging out browsing the web or whatever and just lower the RPMs these fans are pretty quiet when they are not in full speed mode and the RGB with Icue app is very cool ans customizable.I also installed the 120mm versions of these fans on my AIO pump radiator, these fans are much quieter even in full speed mode and they seem to work well for cooling my CPU even through the radiator. These fans are a little bit more on the expensive side but they do work very well and have very nice RGB. There are definitely cheaper options out there the main reason I picked these ones were for the speeds which at Max RPM the 140mm model gets 1500 RPMs and at Max Speed the 120mm model gets 2100 RPM at max speed.Overall so far I am very happy with my purchase I was not sure at first because of the noise decibel levels but it is very easy mitigated by adjusting the fan speeds.",
