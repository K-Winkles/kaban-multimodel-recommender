                "reviewText": "I bought these fans (2 sets of 3) because they have the extra set of reversable blades, which I wanted for a show-piece build. The supporting frame of the fans won't show when using them for intake fans, when you change to the reverse blades. Bottom Line I highly recommend them if you are controlling your fans from the motherboard's PWM and ARGB, and not using the \"controller\" others' have complained about. I have nothing bad to say about the controller, it is just that I did not need it for my build, since my Z690H motherboard controls and syncs PWM and ARGB for all fans.The fans are well built and solid; they light beautifully and run smoothly; and they are quiet at low to medium speeds. At full speed (my testing) they can be heard, but I cannot imaging needing to ever run them that fast.I also like that the fans swap easily - without tools - between forward and reverse blades. Also, the fans connect to each other magnetically, as well as the cables connecting magnetically.Now to the only minor installation issue. Some others have alluded to it also. If you do not get the magnetic cable connector aligned perfectly to the fan, the pogo pins on the fan don't connect to all the tiny disks on the cable, opposite each pin. My first install, the fans were Dead - no spinning or lights. So, I needed to \"wiggle\" the connector around to get it aligned. It took me about six tries on one fan, to get the alignment correct, because the magnets are so strong they tend to pull the parts together quicker than the alignment can occur. This is NOT a reason to avoid these fans, I see the strong magnets as a good thing because once you get the alignment correct it isn't going to move. I also had the same mis-alignment with the magnets coupling the 3rd fan to the 2nd, until I simply \"wiggled\" them to align perfectly. THERMALTAKE should take note, and do a little redesign work so the magnetic connectors work more precisely, else they may get some complaints and returns, from unaware buyers, that the fans just don't work.Bottom line is, I really like these fans and the are my new 1st choice for reverse blade fans.Highly recommended !!!",

But the fans were not spinning nor lightning. No manual nor youtube video could describe how to debug it. I tried to fix the SATA power connection and, as its pins are so loose, they short circuited and burned the controller.I do not know why they use such terrible SATA connectors. Power supplies have so many other options with more power and better plugs. Also, the controller should have better electrical protection.Do not buy it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent, but overpriced",
                "reviewText": "Don't get me wrong, these are some of the prettiest fans money can buy. They have more LEDs than just about any other fan outside of the Quad version of the same brand. However, that doesn't mean they aren't overpriced. In fact, I almost miss my old Thermaltake Premium fans. The Rings on this are so bright, you can hardly tell the actual fan itself is lit up, and the lighting on the blades actually is one of the nicest looking parts (I included one picture of the old fans for comparison). Even if you dim the rings, the blades still don't show as good, and they only have 5 addressable LEDs for that portion, so it gives you way less options for effects. And while the LEDs can be changed individually for every single one, the software doesn't have any options to add layers like iCue from Corsair does. To top it all off, it's really irritating you have to spend $160 just to even have an option of white fans (Because $140 isn't enough already...).Overall, they push a lot of air, which keeps your system cool, if a bit loud. The software isn't quite as bad as some make it out to be in my opinion. I actually like the options you're given for effects more than what's offered by iCue or Synapse (Razer), Asus, MSI etc (outside of the no layers thing). Installation was super easy, as with all case fans. You plug the wires into the controller, and the controller into a fan header and a USB 2.0 port. There is quite a bit of cable (too much for most ATX towers), so be prepared to figure out routing before hand.I don't necessarily regret my purchase, but I do think these should be cheaper, and offered in white.",

Otro peque\u00f1o fallo es que para que el RGB se ponga del color que yo le hab\u00eda puesto tengo que abrir el controlador para que se pongan del color que yo les puse, tal vez lo del fallo del RGB de mi ventilador sea un error de fabrica, pero omitiendo eso preferir\u00eda que los ventiladores se pusieran del color que yo les puse cu\u00e1ndo enciendo la PC",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The idea of this product is very very cool. I bought one three pack set for my younger sister's rig and while they are very nice and tidy fans, I feel as if theres a few issues with the product that buyers should take note of:- The connectors can be rather finicky. After installing them in the case, we took the PC to my sister's room to do a test run to see if it was set up correctly. On the first boot with the fans installed, the fans did not light up or spin. This resulted in around 20-30 minutes of me researching and seeing if anyone has had this same exact issue; which there was a couple people with kind of similar issues (but as a new PC Builder I had no idea about specific things or if I happened to miss something in the install process). I reseated cables multiple times and nothing worked until I swapped the connectors on the controller from spots 1 and 2 to spots 5 and 4, and then reseated the magnetic fan connectors. Finally, they came to life.- When I reinstalled the back side panel, the fans on the side of the case lost RGB but still spun. Reseating the magnetic fan cable again solved this issue.While the idea of these fans are super cool, they do take a lot more troubleshooting and effort than regular case fans. For some, it may be a good idea to wait until this idea is more perfected.",
