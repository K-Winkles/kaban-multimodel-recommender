The generator has an external exhaust pipe, but there is always some leakage, plus the cool air brought in from the vents keeps the heat from building up too much. We've not had to use the generator more than a couple of hours at a time this season, but the fans have done their job so far.",

                "reviewText": "What you need to know at a glance:* This is a good quality USB powered cooling fan (2 fans actually)* It has three fan speeds* It is USB powered* The 2 fans work together - they cannot be operated separately* Removable feet* Can be mounted to blow or draw air awayI ordered the Qirssyn Electronic Cooling Fan because the fan on my graphics card in my PC has failed. The Qirssyn fan is USB powered and so I was able to plug it into an available USB port on the back of my computer and use the Qirrsyn fan to blow air through the rear vent and out through the front vent. The fan is not silent, but is very quiet. Both fans turn on together and run together - they cannot be operated separately. I tried each fan speed in turn and finally settled on using the highest speed. I tried using the fan to draw air out of the case and also to blow air into it. I settled on blowing air through the computer case. When I placed my hand in front of the front vent on the computer, I could feel the air being blown through the case. The feet are removable which meant that I could position the fan behind my computer without having to have a large gap between the machine and the wall and it still draws air very well. My computer internals are now well cooled. I have no doubt that this fan would cool a router, Playstation, AV equipment etc. very effectively. There are so many ways in which this fan could be used and it works very well. For the price I think this is a very good fan.",

I attached a drier vent hose to the back and use this fan to create negative pressure, forcing air out of the box and outside. This keeps the smells down, which as you know if you have cats, even if you keep them clean they can still smell pretty bad from time to time.This fan is simple to use and to power. No electrical knowledge needed!",

                "reviewText": "So, I used a small fan, about 1/4 of the size of the Qirssyn fan, to cool my work computer. My office faces the west so my office and work computer gets hot during the midday. The small fan was doing a decent job, but I was not too fond of a few things about the smaller fan. The main issue was that it wasn't USB-powered, and since I use a standing desk converter, I needed an extension cord to reach the plug (I'm 6'1). The length of the cord from the controller to the fan was too long, and the controller was as big as the fan itself. Although it provided strong airflow, the air distribution was minimal and didn't cover the whole surface area since it was a small fan.The Qirssyn fan is oversized for the mini desktop I got from work. It is wider than the computer, so I placed two wood pieces on both sides of the computer as a base for the legs. The fan comes preassembled, but I wanted to blow air towards the leg, so I had to disassemble it and flip it around. I like that this fan is USB-powered and has low, medium, and high settings. I initially thought the air was not blowing as strongly as my smaller fan, but I was wrong. It provides strong airflow and distributes the air sufficiently to cover the whole surface area. My computer is a lot cooler and running smoothly now. I also like that it is completely black, even the metal guard. This fan is exactly what I was looking for.",
