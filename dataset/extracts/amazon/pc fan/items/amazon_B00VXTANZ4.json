SSO2 bearing The NF-A6x25 features the further optimised second generation of Noctua's renowned, time-tested SSO bearing. With SSO2, the rear magnet is placed closer to the axis to provide even better stabilisation, precision and durability. Flow Acceleration Channels The NF-A6x25 impeller features suction side Flow Acceleration Channels. By speeding up the airflow at the crucial outer blade regions, this measure reduces suction side flow separation and thus leads to better efficiency and lower vortex noise.

It moves an okay amount of air for its size, temps have gone up several degrees vs. the much louder fan it replaced (also replaced two others with larger Noctuas). If you need maximum cooling, this probably isn't your best option. But if you need adequate cooling with near silence, this is the ticket.Installation was as easy as any other fan. The included cables help a lot with hooking it up to whatever pin connectors you have available. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Even with the reduced airflow it keeps the computer within a safe temperature range.",

                "reviewText": "I like'em! (see pics) Got two for my pc (HP P7-1010) to get more air moving in there. Also bought one of the 40x40x20 little guys to get some air coming in the side vent on my tower. These things do not move very much air. But that's OK, it's all I could really do for my tower. And who cares about the color? I think they look awesome. If you want more air movement I would get the Bgears fans. Those things are about 50% more powerful than Nactua's. I know these fans are rated at 3000RPM, the Bgears I have are rated at 5000rpm and they destroy Nactua's fans. BUT! they're louder. Not annoyingly loud, but definitely noticeable. But cmon you can't spin at 5000rpm and be silent... If you look at the picture of my side panel you'll see what I did. My pc was bought all in one at Staples back in 2011. I've upgraded everything possible. Best cpu my mobo will take(AMD Phenom II X6 1065T 95watt)(32gb RAM Kingston Hyperx Fury)(2gb EVGA Nvidia GeForce gtx 750 Ti)(two Solid State Drives by Western Digital, a 500gb, and 1TB)(Seven USB 3.0 ports (pcie card))(an Antec A30 Heatsink fan)This thing is my baby. I know it's not a custom build. But I've had it for almost 10 years and it runs fine still. I can run almost any game as of 2020 without issue. Audio and Video editing (Pro Tools & Sony Vegas Pro HD) run flawlessly. I've turned a manufacturers system into a monster. And I hope to get another 10 years out of it. But I do plan on finally building my first custom build next year. Sorry for the rambling lol I don't know why I do this on reviews lolNactua is probably the best in quality. I recommend you buy these bad boys. Or whatever size you need. Get'em!",

Server was close to my desk so I wouldn\u2019t use it because whenever the fans will spin up it was uncomfortably loud.I kept reading about the Noctua fans being quiet so I figured I\u2019ll replace them if I didn\u2019t like them I could always return them.Now in my server there are 6 fans including a cpu fan cooler.I replaced only the CPU fan and I was so impressed I replaced the rest.Now, on my video the phone is right up to the server so that\u2019s the sound you hear. At the time of the video recoding the fans were spinning fast as there was a high load on the server. However I could say the fan on my network switch is probably louder than the server.Once the server returns to regular load and the fans RPMs go down it gets even quieter.There\u2019s even an adapter to make the fans even quieter but I didn\u2019t use it as I don\u2019t think they are needed.I am blown away with how quiet these fans are. Totally worth the investment. I\u2019m happy with my server as I can now use it.If you have a computer or server right in your office or work space, do yourself a favor and get these fans. You will hear all kinds of noises that you didn\u2019t even know where there. Lol !Five stars for Noctua !! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
