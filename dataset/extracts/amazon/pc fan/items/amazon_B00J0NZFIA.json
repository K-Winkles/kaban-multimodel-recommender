                "reviewText": "Used in a trailer for the bathroom roof vent. Being 12V, and having it's own shroud, I was able to just drop it in place and use it.Pros: Quiet, works fast enough. Definitely better than the Heng or Camco options. Theirs have the worst blades I've ever seen! We'll see how this one deals with sunlight and heat for a few years, though... Comes with free screws to mount to standard PC cases or heatsinks that accept this size of fan. The larger size is precisely how they're able to stay quiet at that flow rate. Lower RPMs per CFM, you know?Cons: Wish I could get a less quiet version of the same kind at that price, with higher airflow.Oddity: You'll have to splice these with wire nuts and a pair of electrical (cutting) pliers, or order some 3-pin header if you want to go modular. These are intended for interior use (i.e. inside a computer case), so do NOT use where they can get wet or in direct sunlight. Either way, you broke the warranty the moment you used them for this application. At the low price they have compared to 'official' ones of similar quality (not the ones typically installed that are about the same price as this one, we're talking a few times more) for these vents, this is not much of a loss. ;) Avoided the 'RV tax' by using these!",

                "reviewText": "I have the ThermalTake Tower 100 and I love it but I noticed the top was a semi trap for heat. With all the mesh, cables, and everything else the heat just kinda swirled around up there.....SO I bought this fan with the intention to zip tie it to the top panal. had the hopes it would SUCK all the air through the top \"mesh\" a bit better and it definitely does that. Was worried about the noise......overall its really not NEARLY as bad as I thought it would be. Yes it does put off noise..I mean its a fairly large fan but it's is fairly quiet overall. It's no worse than one of the smaller fans. As it is sitting eye level I wondered if the LEDs would bother me or be a distraction...not at all. They all are either blurred with plastic or facing the other way, but this is not to say that they don't light the area up! A really nice addition to the case and it would be pretty sweet to see ThermalTake consider forming the top around this type of thing to really push the vertical case air situation. Could add a little lip around it make the case 2 inches taller and it would be AMAZING for the air movement!TLDR: Fan really moves air with a nice glow thats not too bright.",

Although not using it for a PC case (they make cases this big?) they are better for static pressure than high flow airflow. -Which might be better or worse depending on your usage so don't get the idea that you might start making drones out of these lol. I am giving it 4 stars due to how fragile the blades are as I found out when I broke a blade one off when I got a little careless figuring out which way they blow. Luckily enough glue on the broken blade helped balance the fan out.",

My system is in a separate cubby hole so the noise of the fan is inaudible but even when I'm right over it it's not that noisy. I'm powering it with a cheap 300W computer power supply (there are videos to show you how it will work without being plugged in on a computer ) Very happy with it.",
