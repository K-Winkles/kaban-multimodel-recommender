                "reviewText": "These fans are a fantastic deal when you consider you are getting 5 fans at this price point.I cannot say how they are after extended use as I have only just installed 2 in my computer within the past day.I have 3 fans in my computer case. One had recently started making noise again. Rather than oil it as I have done in the past when this happened I decided to replace it.I really only needed one fan but, when you add shipping to the lower priced fans that are sold individually the price is a bit too high. And, the average price of budget fans seems to be around 8 dollars for one. That is why this is such a great deal! Five fans at 8 bucks each come to $40 bucks and that is before shipping is added.I got free shipping on these making the deal even better.The lights are far brighter than I expected. I did check out the photos in other reviews but, I must say none of the photos accurately represent just how vivid the color is and how bright the light is.After seeing how the lights looked when I swapped out the noisy fan I decided to swap out the fan in the front of my case even though that one was still working fine. I thought it would look night having more visible light coming through the front of my case (the original fans are the kind with a couple of blue LED's in the center the light pattern is different with these new ones but far more visible through the structure of the case.I did not replace the 3 case fan as the last one is in the back and I really don't see that under normal circumstances.So, I have 3 spare fans in case I need them.Yes, there are better fans on the market but you will pay far more for them.These look great and work as expected.I opted for blue as that is the color of the LED's in my original fans (I had no choice of color when I built my computer, I just bought the least expensive fans they had). Over the years I grew accustomed to that color. However, if the green and red are as vivid in person as these blue ones I think either of those would have been a great color choice too (though that is just an opinion of aesthetics).They are quiet but far from silent.If I have one criticism of these fans it would be the rubber anti-vibration pads. Given that they are part of the structure it is not as if you can test how well they work by using the fans without them compared to with them. Also, the anti-vibration pads are not especially thick so, once you tighten the screws you will tend to compress them enough where I think it is doubtful they have any actual effect when it comes to canceling vibration. A couple of rubber washers could accomplish the same thing in my opinion. Though it would be harder to get washers in place while installing a fan. So, being an actual part of the fan design is good in that aspect.To sum up, if you are in need of some fans these are a very good choice. they are decent fans at an excellent price.",

However I know from a previous system that dusting these fans is very difficult due to the large amount of surface area and crevices on the fan blades.Overall these fans are still a great value for the money.",

I got these expecting the same level of noise but man was I in for a surprise. These things are like ninjas in the night! The extra padding on the fans makes a BIG difference. I can't tell for sure the amount of air they are pushing though but when I'm running BOINC for SETI@Home they crank up and even at full blast are a lot quieter than my old ones. I'll come back later and update the review when I've got a good time-til-death of how long they actually last. The only thing I would caution about is the light level. These things are pretty bright. With the 8 in my rig, I can light up the room at night and not have to turn the light on. They make a great nightlight for downstairs though so it works for my house. Just be aware they might blind you over time. :)",

                "reviewText": "Good price point but 2/5 of the LED rings on the fans do not work all the time. One plugged directly into the motherboard on one PC will turn on roughly every other time the PC is on. Sometimes it will start working after 30 minutes or so and sometimes they just stay off. When the LEDs turn on with the PC, they stay on. On another PC, I have installed a couple of these from my 5 pack and one of those does the same except it is plugged in with a splitter to a molex connector. The fans themselves are quiet and work fine. They are not silent but not terribly loud either. Overall I do like them, I just wish the LEDs were on all the time. Nice and bright when they are on and working.",

                "reviewText": "These are literally the sexist computer fans I have ever seen. Just looking at them not on, they are made of some really nice looking, high quality plastic. The blades look really cool, and the fan body has some really interesting geometric shapes that might actually make them stronger but ultimately just look really cool. The anti-vibration pads are an interesting feature that I have never seen in a computer fan before. The pads seem to have some dampening effect and I found that they helped a lot with mounting as they act as non-slip pads as well. The lighting is a another level of amazing. Instead of four LEDs in the corners of the fan they have ribbon LED strips around the circumference of the inside of the fan. They create literally the most amazing lighting effect I have ever seen in a computer fan. The pictures don\u2019t even vaguely do them justice and I know I can\u2019t explain it, but they take on this really fascinating three dimensional vortex of light awesomeness. The power cable was not as nice I might have liked considering how nice the rest of the fan is but it has all the connectors you might need. Finally the price for all five, I think, is a steal considering that five, not nearly as awesome, fans could easily be ten to twenty dollars a piece. Overall these are the best, coolest, and dare I say, sexist fans I have ever had the pleasure to stumble over.",

Overall a very satisfactory purchase especially considering the price.",
