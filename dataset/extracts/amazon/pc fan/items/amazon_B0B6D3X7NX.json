                "reviewText": "I've been waiting for the right time to land this case because I'm all about the TUF line of products made by ASUS.I'll make this review shorter than my normal lengthy reviews with a simple PROS/CONS list:PROS:Cost - At $129.99 (on sale) I felt this was a reasonable price to pay for a style of case that catches my eye.Ample space - This case has lots of space for airflow, components, and LEDs. I'm not used to working with LEDs but there are also connectors for the built in case LEDs (front fans). The headspace for a radiator and a full water cooling systems is generous as well. With this case, you won't have to worry about cramping things into a tightly confined space.Screens/Filters - The case comes with some very nice screen and filter features to keep dust to a minimum. My house accumulates dust with people and dogs (and a ball python!) so I'm a stickler for having space for filters.Fans - Plenty of provided fans that are quiet, move air handily, and the front fan LEDs are a nice touch.Enclosed PSU channel - This is a nice touch. This IS a PRO, but I'm a little disappointed that there's no rubber passthrough grommets. They're located to the right of the motherboard mounting space but I think the PSU channel's opening should have them as well. Keep the PSU isolated as much as possible is my thought.CONS:Cable Management - It's a defacto standard in most all cases now, and while this is addressed, the right-side panel seems short on zip-tie anchor points. I would like to see more of a lattice of anchor points, even if they're affixed to the base instead of being punched through. Asus included a good number of zip-ties however. So a small CON and not too glaringly annoying. It's a personal wish so I'm not deducting any stars.Width - While there's lots of space in this case, a little narrower of a design would be good. I know cases are handling larger and larger GPUs and water cooling, but I think ASUS designed this one overly generous. It encroaches on too much of my desk space and I didn't realize this prior to buying it. Should I have measured? Yes. Did I? No. My fault. But it's still pretty wide.All in all, I'm happy with the case. It's a nice change from my black case without any RGB. I don't need a lot of RGB but his provides just enough to keep things happy and not too distracting. I would recommend this case to any PC builder that wants a very cool looking case, likes the ASUS brand, and wants to customize a PC that fits an individuals varying tastes in components, cooling, and lighting.",

                "reviewText": "This pc case is a beast that makes my 3090ti look small. Built with quality that\u2019s for sure! Glass and back panels remove easily and feels durable. The way this case is built, it allows you to access areas that would normally be annoying in another pc case. Take the tiny power wires that everyone hates because they are small and usually fit at the bottom of your mobo. Well with this case, you can remove the bottom and plug away.Pros:DurableSpaciousGreat fansNot too expensiveHas carrying handlesComes with zip tiesIncludes everything neededCons:Rear fan does not have RGB (strange when the front three fans have RGB)Can take up a lot of desk space (was not an issue for me)",

Although it does come with 4 built-in fans, they're only 1400RPM each. You may want to upgrade them in the future with 1900+RPM fans. That being said, the case stays cool with the default fans. The RGB looks great to! For $120, you can't go wrong! Highly recommended!",

El producto se notaba bien empacado y su transporte pareci\u00f3 ser muy cuidadoso. Excelente vendedor Zegucom c\u00f3mputo.La calidad del gabinete es excelente, su construcci\u00f3n es robusta y cuenta con suficientes espacios tanto para la gesti\u00f3n de cables como para un buen flujo de aire. En mi caso la CPU y la GPU no exceden de los 45 \u00b0C en carga de procesado pesada (jugando Cyberpunk 2077 con gr\u00e1ficos Ultra en 2k).Aparte de los 10 ventiladores visibles se pueden montar tres adicionales en el panel met\u00e1lico lateral. En la parte superior soporta el montaje de radiadores AIO 360, en mi caso un Aorus Waterforce X 360, cuyo radiador mide 39.5 cms.Cuenta con una pieza cuya funci\u00f3n es soportar el peso de la tarjeta gr\u00e1fica.Tiene filtros antipolvo magnetizados f\u00e1ciles de remover y limpiar.Los paneles laterales y frontal son muy f\u00e1ciles de remover y volver a montar.En general, su montaje resulta muy sencillo por los buenos espacios que tiene y las pocas herramientas que se requieren, en mi caso s\u00f3lo requer\u00ed utilizar un desarmador de cruz (para la MOBO y ventiladores).",
