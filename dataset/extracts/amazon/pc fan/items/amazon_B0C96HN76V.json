                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice desktop fan at a reasonable price",
                "reviewText": "Was looking for a standard 80mm size desktop fan with decent airflow that didn't use excessive power. This fan seems to be meeting my demands.The airflow isn't quite a high as some similar-size fans I've had, but it's enough to do the job and only uses a fraction of the current and power of those other fans. Granted, I don't typically max out my computer resources. I mainly use the computer for surfing the web. If you're doing hardcore gaming, it's possible that you may benefit from a fan with greater airflow, but this is more than enough for my needs. It also has a wide range of operating voltage to control the speed level, from around 3v to as much as 14v....At 3v, there is very little airflow and the fan is silent. I can start hearing a light wind sound around 6 or 7 volts with a light breeze. In the 12 to 14 volt range, it's a decent breeze and that's definitely audible even from several feet away. I don't think the noise level at this range is excessive or unexpectedly high given the size of the fan and airflow amount. 80mm is not a very large size and to force any decent amount of airflow through a space that size is going to make some wind noise, so that's unavoidable.It also has a metalic protection shield to prevent you from touching the blades and getting your fingers cut. I've had it happen to me many times with computer fans and it doesn't feel good! So that feature is definitely a plus to me.The price is also fair and it seems to be made of decent quality. I can't speak for how long it will last, but It's been running non-stop for the past month and a half and showing no signs of any issues thus far, so I'm hopeful it will last a long while.",

                "reviewText": "I've used these fans as part of an aquarium top that I've built after my last fans had an issue and needed to be replaced. So far they've exceeded my prior fans and they run almost constantly. They are not the most quiet fans that you'll find but that is all going to depend on the voltage that you are running through them via your fan controller. In my case, I am not running a variable speed and so they're running full open at a constant 12V through a temperature control relay.45CFM is fairly good airflow for a 80mm fan, there are certainly ones that push more and there are a bunch more that push less. They do make a bit of noise (32 dBA) but they're not loud enough to bug anyone or rather really even hear it unless they're closer than 5ft away and since this is specific on the aquarium, it's not really a large deal at all since we're just using it for providing a cooling function (one fan pushing air in, one pulling it out).As far as overall value, it's a great affordable option, is proving to be durable and would certainly go with it again.",

                "reviewText": "I originally got this fan as a DIY laser engraver enclosure ventilator fan. However, even though the 2 pins looked like they'd fit my laser's connector, there wasn't any way they'd fit.Plan B was to add it to my desktop PC to provide additional cooling. Turns out that the motherboard only has 4 pin connectors, as shown in the photos of my existing CPU fan and the case fan photo.I hate to only give 3 stars, considering that I haven't even been able to power on yhe fan to test it. However, without being able to power on the fan, I can't comment on its utility or whether or not it is quiet or loud.Here's what I know: I would have to spend at least another $4 to buy a 2 pin to USB power adapter to be able to power this fan, assuming the adapter I found online actually fits the connector.Second, a search for reviews comparing 2, 3 and 4 pin fans revealed that 4 pin fans tend to be the most powerful and to have variable speed control, whereas 2 pin fans usually don't.It doesn't make sense to me to add a less powerful, downgraded fan to my PC or to buy an adapter to power it. Hopefully this review will inform other buyers to check the number of pins on a fan before buying.",
