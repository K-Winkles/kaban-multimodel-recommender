                "reviewText": "Kind of disappointed with some of the hardware that goes with it. The controller for this and the one for the fans that came with the NZXT liquid cooler take up some space. I would have preferred rgb that connects direct to my motherboard like the fans on my case which are also NZXT brand (weird). Did get it all concealed in the back but omg it was a mess of wires to dig through when I was troubleshooting a fan not turning. That\u2019s my first issue. Second is the software for the rgb setup. Overall I like it and the layout of the PC Monitoring screen. The problem with it is it doesn\u2019t accurately show the load on my CPU. Might be because my CPU is a 14th gen i7 but it\u2019s been out a few months now. Even with these two minor gripes I love the end result. Wasn\u2019t a fan of NZXT before but I might be warming up to them.",

Been rocking older out of date NZXT fans that were a little loud for my liking - just switched 1 of the fans to this 140mm and wow day and night difference. I also noticed there is less LEDs in this version than my old version so I was a bit worried \u2026. NO NEED TO WORRY!!!!!!! Honestly it looks so much BETTER than my older one and has less LEDS but somehow is brighter ! No complaints and a great great huge upgrade from the older versions. I have now ordered more to switch out my other fans!! I recommend if you have NZXT motherboard and/or a nzxt hub controller it will make it a breeze to use these fans.",
