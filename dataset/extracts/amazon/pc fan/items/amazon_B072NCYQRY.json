I have a fan controller and they all seem to play nicely together. Very happy with this choice!!",

                "reviewText": "I am somewhat disappointed in this fan. It is advertised as being variable speed depending on the voltage. Input voltage between 5v-12v. I had hoped to be able to control the speed of this fan using a PWM controller. I realize this is not the intended use for this fan, because the PWM controller does not actually vary the voltage but rather the duty cycle of the negative lead. but I was hopeful because another reviewer stated he was using his in this manner. It did not work. In fact I had to turn the POT on the controller all the way up before the fan would move at all. Turning down the POT even slightly and the fan shuts off. I'm not going to give the fan a low mark because it did not function as I had hoped, because I understand it was never intended to be used in this fashion. I will say the fan is very quiet and seems to push a fair amount of air. But I will probably be sending it back because it doesn't function any differently than the fan I'd hoped to be replacing.",
