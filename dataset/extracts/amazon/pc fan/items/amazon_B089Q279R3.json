I love that it clips to my headboard and is fully swivel for my individual needs. The only down fall is the safety cover can easily be fall off which I rectified with a twist tie. It's easy to clean and maintain. It's compact for travel but really puts out the airflow as needed. I will look to this company for all my future fan purchases.",

                "reviewText": "What a perfect little fan for a desk or a bedside table. Super adjustable - you can angle this thing however you want. And it gives off a surprising breeze for its tiny size. And it\u2019s super quiet. On its lowest two settings you can barely hear it. On the highest setting it gets a little noisy but the middle setting is all you need. Again, it\u2019s best for clamping on a shelf at your desk or on your bedside table or headboard - don\u2019t expect this thing to cool off your entire office or workshop. But it does it\u2019s job as a tiny personal fan. And it does it well. Great product.",

I used this while traveling, as I have to have a fan blowing on me to sleep. In the end, I was happy with the small size as it fits nicely in my luggage.",

I\u2019m always sweating, so my manager felt bad that I was always melting and found this on Amazon and sent me the link. I thought we\u2019ll why not I\u2019ll give it a go. Brought it into work on wendsday, it plugs into the computer with its USB port, clipped it onto the counter and faced it towards my station. I\u2019m right next to the desk. Turned it on and it\u2019s pretty powerful. I love how I can just turn it in the direction I need it in. It\u2019s fantastic. I haven\u2019t had to tie my hair back all week. That\u2019s a big deal. It kept me comfortable all week. The girls are happy I\u2019m not turning on the air conditioner and I\u2019m comfortable with my little fan. I\u2019m so pleased. The claw is strong to. I\u2019m surprised it is able to hook onto larger things. Anyway love love love it.",
