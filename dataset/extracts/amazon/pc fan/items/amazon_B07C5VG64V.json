Ultra-tight tip clearance The NF-A12x25 has a record tight tip clearance (distance between the blade tips and the inside of the frame) of only 0.5mm. This highly ambitious design sets a new benchmark for 120mm fans and helps the NF-A12x25 to work more efficiently against back pressure, such as on heatsinks or radiators, by reducing leak flows through the gap between impeller and frame. Metal-reinforced motor hub The centrepiece of the NF-A12x25\u2019s motor hub is made entirely from steel and the axle mount is reinforced with an additional brass structure.

Temps are better than the stock fan that came with my CPU cooler. I have 13 fans in my PC case. All the other fans in my case are ARGB, but this is ONE fan that I can appreciate for what it provides over stupid ARGB lights. The cooling this thing provides for a small 120mm AIO CPU cooler, at a completely silent audible level, is absolutely amazing. I would have filled my entire case with Noctua fans if they weren't so expensive, but that just goes to show how much a single fan can make a difference in a PC case FULL of fans.",

                "reviewText": "This is actually too good for me. I bought two of these to put on the rear and bottom of my Raijintek Styx case. The build has a Tuf Gaming B660m-plus WiFi board and a 12700k CPU and no GPU card. I figured a CPU as hot as this is supposed to be would make keeping the case cool difficult even with my crazy Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240 AIO I also bought and left the stock fans on.Right out of the box these fans are hefty. There's some meanness just in holding onto it. Much heavier than I'm used to, no doubt about it. They exhibit a lot of weight just on the blades themselves. Give it a flick and notice how long it takes to stop. It's not quite a fidget spinner but closer than anything else I've tried that calls itself a computer fan.The cable sleeves are a nice touch. corner Bumpers are nifty. Not too hard to pop them off and install the included gasket thing that you can use to block all air from escaping around the sides (between the corners) (recommended for use on high pressure applications like Radiators). The included and pre-installed bumpers cause a gap of about 1mm all along the sides that some air could escape through otherwise. Another solution is just to remove the bumpers from the corners on the side that you will have against what ever it is this is going on. In theory that'll result in more noise but a tight seal is assured.The anti-vibration mounts are little rubber tubes that you can pull through the screw holes. the longer end goes through the fan all 25mm and sticks out the other hole. The shorter end you pull through the screw hole on your case or what ever. The ends of these are tapered, you pull hard on it until the wide part pops through. I wouldn't use that to mount it on a radiator. I didn't use them on the case either, but some might prefer it. I think this is ideal for a temporary install though. You can pop them back out, hopefully not breaking the tube off in the process and easily reuse elsewhere. These do stick out a ways. If you're gonna use it somewhere there's not room for the little rubber tube to stick out you can cut it off once you have it installed, but doing so will make a future installation using the same mounts more difficult as you no longer have anything to pull on.My setup lets the CPU package have 144 watts at all threads max load, 4.7ghz p, 3.6ghz e. The darn AIO which I have on top pushing air out is so mean it's keeping the whole case cool all by itself. Meanwhile, I can stop the fans on the AIO and these Noctuas are mean enough pushing air into the bottom and back of the case to passively cool the AIO's radiator, lol. My CPU idles around 72f, temp sensors on the Motherboard between 72 and 93f while doing light load tasks like web browsing. My case is cold to the touch.I put one of these on the other side of the radiator from the stock fan, set it to half speed then gave the stock fan a flick with my finger, it wasn't being powered. It got enough force from the Noctua all the way through the thick radiator to keep spinning, with the Noctua at half speed!This is one mean fan! I did find that if I put my ear right up against the back of the case with the rear Noctua spinning, I can hear the blades going by like you can hear if you go behind a box fan and hear if you talk through it. It's a rather obvious and loud pop every time one of those many blades go by. But at anything more than say 5 inches you can't hear that part of the sound at all.I have no trouble hearing these in the Styx case if I turn them above 40 percent but they really move an incredible amount of air even at low speeds, so if you need quiet, these can do it, just use the included LNA adapter or set the curve in the bios or using a third party program like Asus AI Suite III or Fan Ctrl. These are probably a good investment even if you will limit the speed because their pressure and airflow is so great.For my purpose, the cheaper Redux1700 option would have been fine. I put those on another build I did a while back and they work well there and are not noisy.",

                "reviewText": "These are definitely among the best low noise fans in the world for radiators, period. These are inaudible under 1000 rpm and very quiet under about 1400rpm. At 2000 rpm it is definitely audible but it is not annoying and it is noticeably more quiet than other 2000 rpm fans. Maybe it's just the nerdy side of me that appreciates the engineering that goes into things but I actually find these fans to be fairly attractive (especially with some rgb side lighting). I previously used 5x Noctua nf-p12 redux 1300rpm fans in my build and while I think that at full speed those fans had a more pleasant sound than these do at full speed, these a12x25 don't ever need to get to full speed. The highest these generally sit at a full gaming load is about 1000-1200rpm and they keep temperatures at the same if not immeasurably lower than the p12's did. However unlike the p12's these are basically silent at that load and if I crank up these fans to the full 2000rpm, then I get a nice 5 degrees Celsius knocked off of those temperatures (With that said, I can knock 7 degrees off of my temperatures by removing the front panel of my segotep phoenix case). To my ear, the a12x25 at full load is quieter than the p12 redux 1700rpm, way quieter than corsairs ml120 pro at full bore, quieter than the corsair ll120's, but louder than both the 1500rpm f12 and the 1300rpm p12. Though with that said I have found that the f12 tend to just always have a buzzing sound coming from them after 1000rpm so these are quieter than those at lower rpms as well.TLDR: If you really need that last little bit of performance or silence, these are truly the pinnacle of fan performance right now and are 100% worth it! If you need something that is about 90-90% as good and way cheaper, then the p12 redux 1300rpm are absolutely worth their considerably lower asking price. I can only recommend the f12 chromax if you really need black fans.",

They were starting to show their age with even more noise so decided to finally get some replacements going and choose these. Jumped right into the bios after install to ramp at full speed (sound checking) and was honestly in shock. They pushed more air with far less noise. With the old fans, had them on silent profile which of course isn't the best cooling solution, was fine doing normal task but lacked while gaming. These I can run on performance profile and are still quieter than the previous. Might be making a full switch of the case fans after the impression these are leaving. The case is a 4000D so these get plenty of airflow to move. For those wondering, these fans are on a 280mm rad cooling a 5800x and playing Rust while the cpu sits at a comfy 54\u00b0c-58\u00b0c",
