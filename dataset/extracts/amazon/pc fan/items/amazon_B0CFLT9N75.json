I currently don\u2019t have a case so these are just added as a temp controller until I figure out my own case design. I\u2019m going to 3D print my case to custom fit these fans into the case.The temps were way higher when temping with an infrared and by hooking up 2 of these it dropped the temp by 40+ Celsius. The fact you get so many is awesome too! I\u2019m going to make a big case with 5 fans to run my Raspberry PI to the max.If you have a 3D printer then make sure to make slots for all 5 fans. You\u2019ll have the mothership of Raspberry Pi\u2019s.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this 6 pack of mini fans. One of them did not work. I notified the seller to request a replacement for that one and they quickly sent a replacement, not just for one, but for all 6 fans! Very happy with the customer support they provided.As far as the fans go, they're your basic, miniature 40mm fans for small electronics (processors, certain graphics cards, some laptops, etc.) Obviously, they don't have the airflow of a stanard 80mm desktop fan, but still a decent enough airflow considering that these are half the size. More than enough flow to cool most small devices. While you can certainly hear the airflow blowing when you're close by, it's a very \"low noise\" whisper sound. Inside of a computer case, you probably would not hear it at all (or if so, just barely).Not sure what kind of life expectancy they will have. Considering that one was already defective on arrival, that concerns me a bit about motor quality. But they seem sturdy and quality-made. Plus, for this price point and the seller willing to stand behind the product should it fail prematurely, I'm willing to try these in a few of my devices. Granted, any fan can fail, so it's always a good idea to keep an eye on them regularly to make sure they're still running and/or have monitoring alarms set up on devices that are prone to overheating without a running fan.Will continue to test, but as long as the failure rate stays low, I'll be satisfied.",
