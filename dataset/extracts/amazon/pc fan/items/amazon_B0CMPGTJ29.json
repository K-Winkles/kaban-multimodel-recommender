The power supply can be directly supplied by the power supply to reduce the load pressure of the main board. The temperature control line PWM is connected separately from the main board, so that both power supply and temperature control are correct.4. Suitable for 12V motherboard 3pin/4pin fan. (3pin fan can also be used, but it runs at full speed when plugged in, because 3pin fan has no PWM speed control function)5.
