I bought them 8 months ago in March, and they show no signs of bearing failure like in my old fans. The installation process was easy and fit my existing mount perfectly. The fans barely make any noise, and I was surprised at how good of a deal they were for their low price. I have the AMD adrenaline monitoring software and regularly use it to check my GPU and CPU temperatures. I have an average idling temp of 33 Celcius and typically reach only 55 Celcius during my normal gaming sessions. The highest I've ever reached was 70 Celcius, but that was from playing a heavily modded game of Ark Survival Evolved. In summary, these fans work great!",

                "reviewText": "These fans look very nice and keep my case circulated well enough, but after a month I started noticing that one of the fans sometimes would make a light clicking sound. A few months later it got quite a bit worse.Here I am nearly six months later after using these fans and two of them still work fine.However, the clicking sound on the third fan got so bad, that I had to take it out as it quickly became so noisy that it wasn't worth putting up with the noise, even for a budget build. In fact, it started clicking so loud that I could tell it was about ready to fail, so obviously, I immediately removed it.So for the price, I got two good fans that work pretty well and one very bad one. Would I use these fans again? For a serious build, no, probably not. For a temporary get-by build until I can get something a bit better, I might, depending on the price at the time of similar items.Overall for the price, it wasn't a bad deal as I got two good working fans, but I still feel a little gypped the third fan turned out to be bad. So so far out of three fans, two have lasted 6 months, and 1 has failed and was making irritating noises throughout its very short lifespan.I will update later down the road when these fans die, to let other buyers know how long these other two fans were able to last.PROS:They look very nice (are NOT ugly some other cheaper brands of fans)Good length of cordPush enough air for a budget build (if you know how to correctly install them so they circulate the most air, depending on your ATX case)Were cheap when I bought themCONS:One of the three fans quickly started making noises after installation and later within a few months started to fail.",

The PC is old and I will be retiring it in a year or so when Win10 is near done. Thus, I did not want to spend much money for ventilation. I added two of the Case Fans from this package of 3 fans to the case . The temps now on the SSD are about 41C under normal use.The fan speeds are constant [only 3pin], however I found them to be very quiet in my case, which is a bonus. The case is mid size and nothing special. I am satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "Needed more intake fans in my Corsair Carbide 275R Tempered Glass case. These were very affordable and do the job excellently. The only downsides I've had is that the included screws were the slightest bit too small to fit through my case (would pop through the metal on each side when trying to tighten). However the screws included by my case did the job perfectly, so I don't think this is an issue with the fans as much as it is the case being weird. The other downside is that the fan cables have a very large MOLEX connector attached that's not removable making cable management a tad harder. The one fan I NEEDED to use the MOLEX connector in place of the 3-pin connector, I could not get to fit. The connector feels very cheap and the pins kept getting pushed out the back of it. I had to avoid using the attached MOLEX connector and use a normal 3-pin to MOLEX adapter to get it to fit. Which as you can imagine looks very ugly now.If I could change anything about these fans, I would remove those MOLEX Connectors and instead include 3-pin to MOLEX adapters in the box. Even for a few extra dollars this would make these fans even better value for money.",
