                "reviewText": "This board is not a PWM fan controller.It seems to use voltage on the base of the (pnp?) transistors to control how much voltage goes to the fan, which results in a narrow range of control. Would not recommend even for 3-wire fans.Your best bet if your stuck with this board is to just remove all the useless components (Transistors, Potentiometers), place a jumper from pin 3 to pin 2 on where the transistors were (bypasses 12v directly to fan), and add your own 5v-tolerant microcontroller with 25kHz PWM output to pin 4 of each fan connector.I also bought another PWM fan controller off Amazon and it fails to start my Noctua fans. You would literally be better off building your own PWM fan controller if your budget is anywhere below $75.",

                "reviewText": "(Video shows the adjustment range for the fan speed, look at the line on the graph behind my hand, the lowest the blue line goes is lowest fan speed, and the highest the blue line goes is the max fan speed, notice how little the knob moves to get this range)Tried to use this to control some 4 pin noctua fans. (PWM fans)The fans would only work if the knob was turned to max, then turned down until you got the speed you wanted. (To overcome the extra voltage needed to start spinning the fan)After a computer shutdown, the fans would not spin back up since they did not have enough voltage (more on that later.)After further inspect of the PCB which includes nothing besides an amplifier and a potentiometer (the knob you turn) there is no way for this to create a PWM signal to control the speed of the fan correctly, which is why i'm confused there are 4 pin fan connectors on this product.After further inspection with an oscilloscope i found out that it does nothing besides vary the 12V signal from 0V to 12V (in a very small adjustment range, see the video).Would not recommend this product if you are planning on connecting 4 pin fans to this. This might work OK with 3 pin fans which are DC voltage control only. Product shouldn't lie about being PWM capable along with putting 4 pin connectors on it.",

I don't understand why it was acting this way, because it should be gradual adjustments, so I sent it back as defective. I bought a front panel one from a different company, and it worked perfectly when used with the same fans.",
