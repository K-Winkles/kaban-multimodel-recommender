                "reviewText": "I bought this fan to replace a 2 speed name brand clip-on fan whose clip broke. I gave this one a shot and have NO regrets. In fact, I LOVE IT. It is the perfect personal fan to set by a table side and direct or oscillate the air. Having 2 separate blades seems like a plus, as on all speeds it provides impressive air movement. The highest speed is enough for a small bedroom. I have found the lowest speed prefect for tabletop use next to the couch. I also use it when I'm on Zoom calls, simply place it behind my computer and I have a constant breeze. The noise level on low speed is quieter than most other fans but still present. However, it's never heard on my computer calls. Highest speed I can see being good for low white noise. Oscillation feature is great bonus, and timer as well (which I haven't really used). Could have a slightly longer cord. Overall, super pleased with this item, and would buy another, as long as it doesn't break. Definitely a perfect step up from an electric personal clip-on fan.",

This totally fit the bill.There are 3 speeds, the real high one is a little loud, but moves some air. I usually keep it on medium, it makes for a nice mix of quiet and still works well. I liked it so much, I bought one for my shop.I can't vouch for longevity yet, but they get a lot of use.",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered this Dr. Prepare fan, I thought it would be a bit bigger so when I received it, I was quite dismayed with the size. Just look at the picture I attached, which shows a comparison of how big and tall this Dr. Prepare fan is along with a bottle of Dasani water and a Monsterarts GMK Godzilla toy. It's as tall as two Godzilla toys and 1 and 3/4 of a standard Dasani bottle. I thought it would be a very weak fan. Thankfully this Dr. Prepare fan proved to be much better than what my initial disappointment led me to believe.It has three levels of fan speed, low - medium - high. The only one that matters to me is the high setting because it provides the best cooling experience for me. The high setting can actually be felt from a few feet away, which is good!As for the noise level, there is barely any sound coming from it at the highest level at all. It's an extremely silent fan so you can easily fall asleep if you want peace and quiet. When I tested this on the first night of getting it, I actually forgot that it existed because I couldn't hear it.This fan oscillates at quite a slow pace. Due to how small this fan is, I consider it more as a personal fan, so the oscillating function isn't really something useful to me, it's simply there as an extra option.As for the timer, I don't use it. I prefer having the fan on at all times until I find the need to turn it off.The only fault that I can find about this fan is how short its power cord is. I estimate it's only around 5 or 6 feet long so you can't use it very far away from an electric outlet.In conclusion, although it's a small fan, it does perform its job very well. The air coming out from the two fans is refreshing and quite strong at the highest setting. There is really no noise that can be complained about, it's really a very silent fan. Because of its small size but satisfying air flow, you can easily put this anywhere you can, as long as there is a nearby power outlet.Since it performs way better than what I expected it to be, this Dr. Prepare fan gets a perfect score from me.",

It is more of a personal fan that needs to be closer than most to feel the air. It\u2019s not for cooling even a small room or circulating air in a space. However, it is perfect for my upper body close to my desk as it cools my face and is quiet. It only lasted a couple of years which is why I bought the new one but to be fair it as on 24/7 365. I had tried a small USB fan but it didn\u2019t even last a year and I hardly used it as I go into the offices once or twice a week and don\u2019t need it most of the time. I use this at home and most of the time it sits right next to my husband in our sun room focused directly on him while he watches TV. It is quiet.",

I only used it at lower speed as it\u2019s more than enough for what I need it. I got a very cheap one first with similar characteristics but had to return it right away as you could nearly feel anything. The only problem I found, is that if you have it on a timer, when it turns back on, it turn on high speed and no oscillation until you change it manually. Would be nice if started in the same settings that was turn off.At low speed is very quiet and it gets a bit more noisy at high speed but not as bad as other fans I tried for the amount of air you get.
