                "reviewText": "I have had 6 of these (along with some of the 80mm versions) running basically all the time for several years with no issues. They are quiet and perform well in both air-cooled and water-cooled applications.They are also a good value, because every fan comes with an extension, a splitter, a low-noise adapter, 4 fan screws, and 4 of those rubber things you can use instead of screws -- and all of those are high quality too.Some people think these are ugly, but when I see these in someone's PC, it tells me they have good taste.I don't see any reason to consider other fans anymore. Unless you really want RGB.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: - High static pressure at low RPM, perfect for radiators - Focused airflow, meaning strait air path for better dissipation - PWM 4-pin fan connector, which is always awesome and great to have due to its optimal adjustments depending on the temperature scenario, and regulates fan speeds perfectly and with ease - Very quiet, seriously plug into you mobo's cpu 4-pin and let it flow! you won't hear it anyway at anytime... until after 1200rpm - Rubber grommets available for use, as well as padding on corners for reduced vibration - Cabling, all throughout from 4-pin connector to extension cable very well braided with rubber and sealed perfectly and with quality - Top of the line and beyond quality everywhere that was touched by anything related to Noctua, they really care and pride the quality from components, to aesthetics, to performance and most noticeably sound.Cons: - Price is definitely a downside, with prime the 2 fans i bought for my H100i were $45 - Color... I know this is their brand image, but at least allow some small customization options like Corsair did with fan rings... - Cabling, despite being very well braided with rubber cover and seals all around the connectors, are very difficult to connect to motherboard 4-pin headers when placed in tight corners or places, putting force on the pins and possibly damaging them in the long runOther Thoughts: This product is the best in its category, and should be considered in a class all of its own. The attention to the flow of air and balance between performance and quietness is the shinning grace of this fan, and truly makes it the best options for heatsinks and radiators of any kind that fit 120mm fans. If connected with the PWM header to the mobo and left as is, the idle speeds will be 600rpm, and will go up to 1200rpm gradually until temps are so high it must go to full speed. If you are like me, and believe in performance at all times, you will set this up to be always at full speed, which still maintains a much quieter profile than any other cooling fan out in the market and at unmatched dissipation at this rotation speed. A must have for radiators, heatsinks and pressure-demanding locations within the PC, and the extra connectors and accessories that come really make this product worth the higher value no matter who owns it and where it is placed. BUY IT NOW!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this freestanding fan to add to the other side of my Noctua NH-U12S heat sink. Wanted to create a push-pull arrangement to bring temps down a few more degrees. I read you can get another three degrees of cooling doing this, but for me it was about five C cooler under heavy load.Designed in Austria, built in Taiwan, there's no \"made in China\" feel to this product. If you get a sense of satisfaction from things that are well designed you'll like this. They've done everything they can to make it hard to fail. This product ships with the little rubber corner guards to block the transmission of vibration, as well as the quick install rubber pull through snaps for installing on the back of your case. If you don't like the rubber pull throughs, there's a bag of four self threading screws if you know how to use a screw driver. Other than that option, you shouldn't even need tools. Comes with two handy wiring extenders, should you need them, both enclosed in a sleeve. One allows you to join with another fan, one just expands your reach. Similarly, I didn't have to worry about easy snap on clips to attach to my heat sink because the Noctua heat sink came with an extra pair.. just in case. They really don't want you to fail.Bearings are milled out of brass with a CNC machine. Thus the 6-year warranty and the quiet. Very artful engineering on the fan blades to dampen resonance and break down the turbulance that might arise. The box says the motor is designed to suppress any start-up hum and I think they got that right too.Mine runs at about 750 rpm under normal load using the standard PWM header on my motherboard for the CPU and it goes up to about 1400 when all 8 cores are maxed out at 100% stress testing with Prime 95. I did learn that my case itself needs better ventilation to take full advantage of these fans, so I'll be adding a port.Worth every penny in my book.",
