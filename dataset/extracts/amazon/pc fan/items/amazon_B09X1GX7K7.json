Most impressive is the cables come with a braided sleeve which classes up the install even more. The color is great. The only thi g I would like to se added is light on both sides of the fan. The lights are only on the intake side. I have ordered them several different times for different build due to the high quality and great performance the 5 pack comes with a controller hub also.",

                "reviewText": "I love these fans. They work great and color is awesome. I would recommend others to buy them. The ONLY complaint I would have is that the color is only on one side. So in my case, in order to get the proper air flow, some of the fans are facing the wrong way to see the lights. That is kind of disappointing, but not enough for me to stop using them. As long as you are ok with that, then they are great. I can't speak on how long the fans will last since I just installed them, but they are working great so far. The pricing was great as well.",

                "reviewText": "I ended up getting a 5 pack of these, then a single, and then a pair of the 140mm fans too. I have dual fan 120mm coolers that are from another company as well, The 5 pack of the 120mm fans and the 2 pack of the 140mm fans came with controllers, and since I am using a server mobo, a Machinist X99 D8-Max, that was needed since I do not have an RGB controller of any type on it.The fans are very nice and quiet. The controllers are easy to connect and mount. As far as power for the fans themselves you do not need to hook them to the controller, just hook them in as normal with CPU fans to the proper place and the rest of the fans to wherever provides the proper 12 volt power and has the connections needed, otherwise they will run full speed.With the controllers you can also hook in ARGB fans that are from another company. I have 3 of the 120mm fans and both of the 140mm fans hooked into one controller, the other 3 120mm fans and the dual fan CPU coolers ran into a splitter on each and back to the other spots on the other controller. All of the fans are connected to the motherboard itself for the actual fan power.To get to different patterns with the fans you will click on a button on the controller so make sure you have things set to where you can get to them to change settings. There aren't a whole lot of different ones, but there are enough patterns to make things look really cool. I went for the one that goes through all of the colors, but didn't quite get them synched up. You honestly aren't going to beat the quality, airflow, and quietness of these fans for the price.",

Unfortunately Corsair at this moment doesn't have fans that are appealing to me. I purchased these and they are exactly what I was looking for. They are bright, fairly quiet, they cool just the same as my Corsair fans, and go perfect with a black case like mine.I also purchased an adapter so I could plug them into the Commander Pro and now I can control them through iCue which in my opinion is the best RGB software. I have a Gigabyte mobo and RGB Fusion is garbage for controlling RGB, one simple adapter solves that issue.I am 100% satisfied with these fans.",
