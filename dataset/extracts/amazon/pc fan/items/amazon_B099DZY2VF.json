As I have no motherboard space for these fans, I wanted to power the new fans via molex. I want to try this configuration out before trying the mutil fan adapter that connects to the CPU fan pins on the motherboard - I don't know if I want all fans to be directed by the CPU needs as I have a CPU cooler that does very well.Simple solution was this adapter which I found was fine. The only quirk was what another reviewer said: the 2 pins on the molex side are not specifically mounted to the exterior plastic so take care in plugging into the female molex coming from the PSU.Last comment is that a ziptie or twist tie was helpful when done connecting - the cords are long enough for anything in the main case, almost long enough to put behind the panel that holds the motherboard - my case case a false back with some slots to run long cords away from the main space.",
