                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very happy with this purchase! Based upon some Amazon reviews I was a little concerned when ordering but I need not have been. The fans arrived in fine shape, they\u2019re well built and work! At 12 VDC they made a tiny bit of noise so I run them at 9 VDC\u2026 at that voltage the fans are for all intent and purposes silent and they still move a lot of air! Five of these fans just sip electricity when driven at 9 volts\u2026 just around 6 watts, 144 watts per day.Obviously I\u2019m not using the fans for their intended purpose inside a computer case or electronic equipment. These little box fans allow a very simple approach to keep rooms that are distant from our fireplace heated. For my project I built some wood frames, routed a channel into the frame, wired them, set some hooks in the top of the doorway and DC power from a cheap transformer, hung them up, plugged \u2018em in and there you have it.As said in the old HBO series Game of Thrones\u2026 WINTER IS COMING!",

                "reviewText": "With a fervent heart filled with zeal for technological prowess, I embarked on a quest to seek out the finest fans that the market had to offer. Lo and behold, my pilgrimage came to a triumphant culmination upon my encounter with the Arctic F12 fans, a testament to ingenuity and craftsmanship. Permit me to regale you with a tale of my profound experience, wherein I shall extol their virtues in great detail.First and foremost, let us discuss the undeniable allure of their affordable price. Amongst the vast array of fan options available, the Arctic F12 stands proud, bearing the mantle of an attractively modest price point. A boon to those with discerning budgets, this fiscally prudent choice in no way sacrifices quality or performance. Nay, it boasts an exceptional value that casts an enchanting spell upon all who seek premium cooling solutions without breaking the coffers.The narrative of installation unfolds as a tale of ease, evoking nothing short of admiration for the designers' astute considerations. I, a mere mortal with limited technical prowess, found myself pleasantly surprised by the simplicity with which these fans were affixed to my system. A seamless process that, much to my delight, required naught but the most basic of tools and skills. Oh, how the fates smile upon those who bask in the breeze of the Arctic F12.Yet, as with all great journeys, there lie trials and tribulations in wait. For those, like myself, whose motherboard lacks sufficient fan connectors, a word of caution: an essential component thou must secure, lest thou find thyself bereft of the full blessings of these wondrous fans. A case fan splitter or a case fan hub shall serve as the key that unlocks the potential of the Arctic F12's cooling prowess, rendering any previous impediments as mere trifles in the grand tapestry of your computing experience.In the realm of acoustic harmony, these fans prove to be virtuosos, emitting nary a cacophonous note to mar the serenity of your abode. In my hours of meticulous scrutiny, I discovered no discordant whispers of excessive noise, but rather, a harmonious symphony of silent efficiency. Engulfed in this tranquil reverie, I basked in the reassurance that my computational haven was undisturbed by the clatter that oft plagues lesser fans.Venturing forth into the realm of airflow, I found myself enchanted by the Arctic F12's prowess. Mighty currents of cooling air surged forth from their supple blades, encapsulating my beloved components with tender care. The perils of inadequate airflow, a bane that can undo the noblest of systems, found no foothold in the face of these formidable fans. For assuredly, they have been crafted with an unwavering dedication to unyielding performance.Lastly, my fellow admirers of simplicity, rejoice, for in the Arctic F12, you shall find the epitome of elegance. Embracing an understated aesthetic, these fans stand as paragons of sophistication, free from the distracting allure of gaudy lights and ostentatious embellishments. Their simple black attire befits any system, harmonizing with a myriad of configurations, thereby bestowing upon thee a timeless allure that is both chic and unpretentious.Thus, dear readers, in the Arctic F12, I discovered a revelation\u2014a treasure trove of cooling mastery that surpasses all expectations. Herein lies a sage counsel to heed: let not thy gaze wander further, for no greater marvel shall be found. Embrace the Arctic F12 and witness the metamorphosis of thy computing experience into a symphony of efficiency and tranquility.",

I ordered 5 more to complete second system (for 2 channel mono audio amplifiers). I saved resources by using these, in testing and modeling. 3-400 wpc, A/B push-pull amplifier**I am 15 feet from my refrigerator, and 3 feet from fan/cooling system... which falls way beneath the noise floor of the room or adjacent kitchen with fridge. (it appears) this cooling system (x2) will be buried in the ambient noise floor of the room, well beneath music. I have to be a few feet away, directly in front of the system to even hear/sense it blowing on me... and a stick of burning incense to detect air velocity. Stunned by the silence!!!Four of these mounted in a p/p with 240mm \"radiator\" fairly hard mounted with M4 hardware, and some rubber decoupling... these fans run quieter then when I was static testing, I could not be happier... much lie ahead in testing the entire water water system, I imagine the mass of the water will further dampen overall system function.LOVE these fans, need upwards of 25 or 30 for multiple projects, further builds and modeling. I am grateful these are inexpensive and very good for my application. In strict audio / audiophile settings; fans have ~always~ had multiple penalties... I am re-thinking this, based on experience with these Arctic fans.",
