                "reviewText": "so Ive Purchase two 3 packs of the fans and i most say this was the best purchase ive made.reason why i purchase this was. I was looking to purchase Lian Li 3 pack Uni Daisy-Chain ARGB LCD fans but they are in pre-order so i had the singles but it was sold out. so as i was on amazon to see if amazon had the new fans that was available ive stumbled on this. Actually it was another fan that looked like this i put that item in my cart but then as i was about to order it this fan popped up. what made me not buy the other well. i wanted something that looked just like the Lian Li UNI Fan 120 Infinity Mirror Module Daisy-Chain ARGB Fans and this was a perfect copy of it. the connection is just like it and what shocked me was the fans comes with 2 sets of connectors the connectors can be used with all 3 fans which you only need to use 1 connector if you wanna use 2 fans and use the single 1 you can use the 1 connector plug that into your motherboard Jrainbow 5v port and use the other connector & plug the single fan onto the other header of the connector. BTW the connectors have 2 ARGB male & Female 3 pin headers 1 PWM header and another 3 pin connector that can be connected to a controller hub or a 3 pin ARGB led strip.Also this is a very cheaper way to get the look you want without paying a lot just for a name brand.the fast connection is what i always wanted to do with out always having to undo my cable management unplug the fans from the hub unscrew the fans 1 by 1. when all i need to do is unscrew 1 set of fans unlink them and thats it. doo to the fans not having any plugs and being used by a uni link and only using 1 cord makes maintenance and replacing easy. BTW they also have a reverse JM-V2 fans that has the Infinity Mirrors on both sides so you dont have to worry about flipping your fans around and seeing the logo not with the reverse Infinity Mirror you can enjoy using your fans in a intake or exhaust hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "I've only ever used fans that connect individually to the fan controller and ARGB controller. This was my first experience working with interconnecting fans. I must say, I wish this was invented years ago (or maybe it was and I was an ignorant shopper). It's just plain sensible to have the fans connect in this manner. It simplifies wiring and looks a lot cleaner when done. The fans run very quiet, and the lighting effect is pleasant and unobtrusive.",

Fans work exactly as advertised. I was able to connect 4 fans together and use the cords on the end to connect to my fan hub. Fans appears with no issues on the RGB Fusion 2.0 software. Fans are very bright, brightness was able to be controlled through the software as well. (The review picture has them on the lowest brightness btw) I can confirm this works with new PCs. All of my parts were manufactured in 2023. Mobo is a GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS ELITE X. I just want a reverse intake version now.Update 1/30/24Swapped out the GigaByte parts for Asus ones due Gigabytes software and Bios issues. Fans work with Aura Sync and have even the same colors as the Asus ones. I was able to daisy chain another 4 fans for the top with no issues.Added 2nd photo of updated build.",
