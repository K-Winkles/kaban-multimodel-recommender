                "reviewText": "I recently added the Noctua NF-A4x20 PWM to my server setup, and the performance of this 40x20mm fan has left me thoroughly impressed. Noctua's reputation for premium quality is well-deserved, and this fan is no exception.Firstly, the build quality is exceptional. The brown color may be unconventional, but it's a symbol of Noctua's commitment to quality. The construction feels robust, and the attention to detail is evident. This fan exudes durability, assuring me that it can handle continuous operation in a server environment.Now, let's talk about the noise level\u2014or rather, the lack of it. This fan is remarkably quiet, especially considering its size. Noctua's focus on providing a quiet solution without sacrificing performance is evident here. Whether my server is working at full capacity or idling, the NF-A4x20 PWM operates silently, contributing to a peaceful and distraction-free environment.The PWM functionality is a standout feature. The fan's speed is dynamically controlled based on the system's temperature needs, ensuring optimal cooling without unnecessary noise. This adaptability is a game-changer for maintaining the right balance between temperature control and acoustics.Installation was a breeze, thanks to the included accessories and clear instructions. The fan integrates seamlessly into my server setup, and the 4-pin connector allows for precise control over its operation.The performance, reliability, and quiet operation make it a top-tier choice for anyone seeking a compact, high-quality fan for their server. In my book, it's a solid 5-star product, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to add performance and lower the noise level of their server or PC.",

Because they spin slower than the OEM fan, the switch DOES throw a fan-fail light. I have not had any drops in performance though, or overheating.",

I read another reviewer that said the point of these is so that you don't have something that sounds like a terminator moving. Very accurate, and is what made me purchase. I don't care about the less air flow, because it is located close to people, so the temperature will be pretty steady and reasonable. I can not hear any noise at all unless I get within 2-3 feet of it, and even with my ear right next to the fan, it is very quiet.I wish that they labeled the cables somewhere. I had to swap 2 of them, but it was a little trial and error. Having a diagram of what each color is (power, ground, pcm, rpm) would have been nice. It was nice that they included some splice connectors to make the job easy.I would prefer less packaging. This was a retail type package and looked very pretty, but for a drop ship item, it isn't needed.",

I really appreciated that.When I tried to go directly into the fan jacks onto the Cisco switch, the fans would not spin, and I smelled a bad smell. Fortunately, it doesn't seem I ruined anything.Luckily, Noctua in their wisdom, included an adapter, with a red & black wire coming off. I snipped off the jack from the original Cisco fans, and spliced the wires, red -> red, black -> black. I left yellow unconnected, and cut it short to keep it out of the way. Wrapped the connections in some electrical tape, of course.Bam, they worked when I plugged them in. They are not the exact same size as the original fans, but definitely close enough to work fine.Swapped out all three Cisco oem fans and they are completely quiet now. I can't hear a thing.10/10 would recommend.",

Used the whole bottle of dye and just enough boiling water to keep the fans I was dying covered, kept at almost boiling for an hour, washed them with clean water, and then dried them over night. Fans still work great, but they still have a very slight hint of brown color. I may try again using a the synthetic blue or just more dye to make them darker, but unless you look at them under bright light you would say they are black. Noctua I will pay a few $ more if you just make these in black so that I don't have to make a mess with dye.",

Comparandolo con un Nidec no tiene nada que hacer el noctua, pero Nidec hace ruido y vibra como un mototool, aun a bajas RPM, en entornos industriales donde no importa el ruido Nidec es superior pues tiene mayor rendimiento ya que gira a mas altas RPM, Pero esque el noctua al 100% hace menos ruido que el Nidec al minimo que deja el PWM y no vibra nada, a similares RPM mueven el mismo aire, pero Noctua no se escucha nada, y nidec pues parece un mini taladro.
