                "reviewText": "I got this mostly for the functionality of cooling my PC and it gets the job done well. Easily connects to my motherboard and was able to get the RGB lights to light up. It doesn't make much noise, at least that I can notice. Though fan noise has never really bothered me. There's not much to say about it. It's a fan for your desktop PC and it looks pretty when it lights up.Next time I need to get a case fan I'll probably get another of these, or one from the same company since I know that it works well.",
