I rated them for stars because they\u2019re a tiny bit loud but the LED work really well and are pretty bright. One thing I did not like about them was they use a two pin connector and you can\u2019t connect them to your motherboard. Overall, the fans are really good for the price and I\u2019m looking to use them for my next builds. I just really hope that they can fix the sound issue because they can get a little loud.",

                "reviewText": "These are decent case fans for a PC. They are not controllable, either in terms of the fan speeds or the RGB, so if you have a system like I-Cue or Chroma, these fans will light up but will only cycle the colors and will not correspond with the rest of your lighting. They also will only operate at the preset speed of around 1200 RPM, which is adequate for a case intake or exhaust setup. They connect via a 4-pin Molex connector so getting them power shouldn't be an issue and as long as you do not have a long cable run for your fans, you should be OK. My case already had some cycling fans so the addition of these did not take away from my killer RGB setup (Sarcasm intended). I am more concerned with having adequate airflow, and these are fairly quiet and do provide a good amount of airflow for the size. At this price, if you are not worried about the RGB being a static pattern, go for it. They get the job done and are pretty quiet comparatively.",

                "reviewText": "So the cables are rather short. I barely got the setup i am using. (Replaced a dying fan and removed the plain case fan, went from 1 intake and 3 exhaust. To 2 intake and 3 exhaust.The RGBs have no controls and no connections to the motherboard. They connect directly to the PSU via 4 pin connectors but only use 2 pins. The other 2 holes are empty.Because of the short cables, and lack of even a on/off toggle i feel that these are worth a 2.5 but the system lacks those half marks.",

                "reviewText": "This is a basic set of three 120mm fans. The fans themselves have no way to control their speeds. They connect with the 4 pin Molex connector. They don't use PWM or standard fan headers. The RGB is static and there is no way to change the lighting. It's always the same, so if you're wanting to use one color at a time these fans aren't for you. These fans don't move a ton of air because they spin at 1200 RPM. They are slow, quiet, but don't move much air. They are okay for a budget builds, but for a high end RGB build these would not be the best choice.",
