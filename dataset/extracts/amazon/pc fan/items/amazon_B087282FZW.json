                "reviewText": "Being that this brings me up to a total mix of seven fans I can't say much about the noise level. They aren't as quiet as the others I think but only by a little. The big downfall is that the air volume is very sad compared to the fans that came with the fractal node 804 case. Holding my hand in front of these is a very faint breeze while the fractal ones are more of a light Breeze if that makes sense. Still they provide some air pressure and with 4 incoming and three exhausting i have good flow which was my biggest concern.Update 08.29.23A few months ago I noticed one of the fans was starting to get a hum. Pulled the case apart to see why it was running louder than usual and narrowed the sound down to one of these fans. Unfortunately it had something wet on one of the blades which I can only assume to be oil from the bearing assembly. Found this same oil in a lesser volume on one of the other fans. Didn't appear to have splattered anywhere else internally so I replaced it started it up and had a hum touched the blades slightly and it seated enough to reduce noise. Just added some more ram to the server last night and on power up the hum wad back just as strong for about 15-20 minutes. Didnt even bother to check about oil. Long story short I don't expect it to last much longer which doesn't encourage me in the other two units. Will be researching replacements with better airflow and quieter performance.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the basic black and white PWM 3-pack.My main complaint is the vibration dampers. They are too thin to be effective (unless you double stack all the pads on one side of the fan like I did). They are basically thick rubber stickers that you have to peel stick. Not a deal breaker, but some thicker pad material would make a huge difference, even if it were only 1-2mm thicker.I don't know if they meet their advertised speed or flow rate, but they sound pretty fast at full speed and they move a lot of air. I put all 3 fans on the front of my case, and at full speed, there is so much air blowing out the back, it feels like the case might start to slide. I put my little 120mm AIO liquid radiator on the rear exhaust and blocked the top case vent so the majority of the case air has to exit through the radiator and PCIe slots. With the front fans off so the cheap NZXT fan that came on the radiator is the only thinkg moving air, it feels like a light breeze coming through the radiator. With the case closed up and front fans blowing at full speed, it feels like a gas powered leaf blower is pushing air through the radiator.They are not quiet at full speed, but I wouldn't expect three fans at 1500+ rpm moving that much air to be quiet. Overall, these get my recommendation.",

The thermaltake fans I paid $10 more for with my old case are way noisier than these.Yeah sure they aren't argb but honestly I don't really care or need them to be addressable.There is some assembly required, but it's literally just installing the noise dampening pads and was stupid easy. I replaced by case fans with these and so far the airflow has been leagues better than the stock fans.I can highly recommend these fans to anyone who wants some RGB in their case but doesn't need them to be argb.Price is also exceptional for what you get",
