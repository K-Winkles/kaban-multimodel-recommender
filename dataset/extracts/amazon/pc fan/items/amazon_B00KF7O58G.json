Vortex-Control Notches Noctua's signature Vortex-Control Notches split up trailing edge vortices and thus spread the fan's noise emission over a wider range of frequencies. This measure makes the fan sound more pleasant to the human ear. Colour-customisable with NA-SAVP1 anti-vibration pads The fan\u2019s frame can be outfitted with Noctua\u2019s chromax line NA-SAVP1 anti-vibration pads. Available in black, red, blue, white, green and yellow, these pads not only damp minute vibrations but also allow the fan to be colour-customised in order to coordinate it with popular build colour schemes!",

                "reviewText": "Let me state this first. I absolutely hate noisy fans and then I hate underperforming ones. If your case FANs are underperforming or doing excessive noise, then this is your chance to make it right.Noctua has been a long time friend in my life now. They keep saving me from having to suffer the horrendous high-pitch noise that can be heard on other FANs. Trust me when I say this, I'm completely bend on silent PCs. The problem is that I also like performing PCs and having to cool down an Ryzen 9 3950X with 128GB of RAM and an RTX2080 Ti is no easy fit.I've purchased a couple of P14 (3 in fact) to replace the current ones in my shiny new NZXT H710i case. The default FANs were silent enough but they were definitely underperforming, also, when turned to max power they are noisy too.I've replaced the 3 intake front fans with 2 of these P14 beauties and also the rear FAN. Put in tandem onto the same controller the front and the read are incredible powerful. When on idle I've set them to 600 RPM. Trust me when I say this, it is impossible to hear them work, it's like you do not have a PC connected at all.I'm using a Silent Corsair power supply so the only noise I hear from my PC now is the actual pump from the watercooler. As soon as I throw a heavy game into the mix those fans will speed up to a max of 1570 RPM. Yes, they can be heard at this point but the whole idea is that they throw power when needed and be silent when they are not.At max power though they are less noisy than the ones installed on the case and since I'm now have 3 FANs in total compared to 4, it's much more quiet too. The peformance has also increased. My GPU is now at 78 full load compared to 81 with default FANs and the CPU is also cooler by 3 degrees.For me the whole point about using this FANs is to reduce noise and still have competent FANs in the system. It was no surprise that I've ended up with a better performing system that is now dead silent when on idle.Noctua never dissapointed me. I could get the premium version of this FAN but this one was better looking for my case so I went with the REDDUX which is a cheaper version in grey. The technology is about the same and the results are similar, it's just these FANs do not have the premium parts such as the low power adaptor and noise dumpeners, fortunately I had a couple of dampeners from my other Noctua FANs so paying more for the premium versions was not required in this case.If you have any doubts that these fans could do good to your system, doubt no more, they are also beautiful !If I ever change the case again, swapping default FANs for these is a must. Nobody can do FANs the way Noctua does, they are so passionate about it and it shows. Their products are TOP quality, you will not be dissapointed.",

                "reviewText": "So these fans are quiet if you compare them to other fans who don't have any interest in being quiet at all. This will also depends on the type of case you have. I utilized them on a G500a case as 3 140mm intakes, and 1 140mm exhaust.These are quiet if you have 1 exhaust and 1intake.However, I added two more intakes to the front of my case and the sound was loud. It was annoying and didn't make for a quiet environment. I tried to keep them at 600RPMS and they were still relatively distracting at that level as well.To be fair my previous case had sound dampening foam on the front and back panel, and the intakes on that case were Two 140mm's rated at 12.5db, compared to these that are rated at 23db.It's too loud for me to ignore and instead I have gone with the \"BeQuiet! 140mm silent wings 4PWM\" which are rated around 13.5db at max rpm.I thought 23db was quiet but I guess it was not quiet enough for me. I may have gotten used to the luxury of a silent PC setup.Anyways, these Noctuas are decent fans just not good enough for someone who wants a really silent PC. I would rate the Noctuas as a \"midrange\" silent PC fan. They are a silent as a duo or maybe even trio setup, but in my particular gase with the G500a, they were not silent running as 3 140mm intakes, even with RPM's turned down.",
