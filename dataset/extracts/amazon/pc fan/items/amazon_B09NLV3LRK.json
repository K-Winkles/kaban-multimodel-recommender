You've 75w available to power your fans.Traditional motherboard headers are limited to 1A max on the 4-pin or 3-pin fan header. They can't power high rpm server grade fans.Typical use cases involve server component cooling or crypto mining.You can power these from the server PSU with a breakout board. RPM control via. PWM is using the blue knob on this board.The main reason to go for PWM control is for efficiency. Traditional fan controllers, control fan speed using a potentiometer which causes heavy power losses == heat. PWM is much cleaner and this board has implemented the same with a 555 timer based circuit.",

Especially like that it doesn't use up a valuable SATA connector for power. Super simple fan controller, just plug in fans and turn a potentiometer knob to set the speed you want. It's tiny, and backed with 3M adhesive, so you can stick it anywhere in the case that's convenient. (Or just leave it randomly hanging in there like me. Windowless cases, ftw!)",
