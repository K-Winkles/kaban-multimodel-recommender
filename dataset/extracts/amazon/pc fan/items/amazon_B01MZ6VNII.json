The gateway seems to run hot as the passive cooling isn't all that great and this leads to overheating issues with lost connection or downgraded speeds. Been using these fans now for a few months and it helped the very first day and has since. Gateway now is cool to the touch and not excessively warm as it had been. Have one fan for intake and the other for outtake, works quite well. Would recommend this to anyone looking to keep their gateway cool or other electronic devices that need to remain cooler.Overall the fans are great. Noise is almost non existent in my use. Installation is simple enough with USB connector. Material is far better than I thought it would be. Very high end quality plastic and metal guards over fan.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these fans in order to cool down my media cabinet that has a PS4, Roku, and surge protector; it has 3 shelves. I recently put my PS4 in a cabinet to keep things less cluttered and noticed instantly that the PS4 ran pretty hot, which lead me to leaving the door opened to the cabinet. The issue of overheating is what pushed me to find ways of combating this issue.The install-Everything was very easy! Their wiring took all the guess work out of the install. All you have to do is plug it up to a USB, and yes I recommend using their USB plug, it does make a difference. These are meant to be stood up, but my plans were to mount them. I disassembeled the fans and used the wired vents to trace it out onto the back of my media tower which is made out of that hard cardboard stuff. I used a jigsaw to cut it out and drilled (4) holes for the (4) screws that keep the fan together. Luckily, I had (8) screws that were slightly bigger than the holes in the fan, so I redrilled the holes to fit the new screws. I placed the fans on the backside of my cabinet, while using the wire vent on the inside of the cabinet and used the rubber feet to keep everything together. Surprisingly enough, the unit is tightly fastened to the cabinet with just the screw and rubber feet. I have (1) fan bringing in cold air from the bottom, while (1) fan is sending out the hot air from the top. (In the process of covering a 3rd hole that is used for wires with a circular outlet that has silicone wedges.) I have it hooked to the thermal remote and sensor. I have the thermal sensor behind the internal PS4 fan.Function-Noise: what noise? Even at max, theres minimal noise! Very surprised. I have had no issues since installing, it just works on its own. It pumps in/out so much air! (I have the fan speed to max.) I wouldn't recommend buying fan filters, it will hinder how much air is being pushed. I tested using one, and noticed an 80% reduction (at least)! (It couldve just been the filter). The thermal remote turns on the fans when it hits 88 degrees, and when it goes below 88 degrees, it shuts off.Overall-I am very happy with the product! The value and quality are on point! AC Infinity just made it too easy to use and install their products! The products just work, I have no worries about the performance or longevity of the units. I recommend their products 100%.",

                "reviewText": "First off, two things: not mounted as intended and not using on AV equipment. But please read next paragraph.These fans and my AC Infinity blower are awesomely very quiet, not silent and not unheard especially if they were in a quiet room, but very quiet. Having have built custom cooling for my older AV cabinets and PCs for years and now needing a custom cooling solution for my home network gear yet not wanting the 80mm PC fan screen, and 120mm PC fan whispers, I stumbled across this brand and some solutions others had employed for their network gear. I was attracted by the PWM (DC power equivalent of VFD for AC) since I was very interested in a high, yet controllable, flow and this brand delivered: flow, control (O/L/M/H or optional controller), quiet. I am not disappointed.I have been studying and comparing this brand and their components and systems for nearly a year and I could not find a reasonable product on the market in the performance and price point as these. And, while they were not a perfect mounting fit for my needs, I was able to easily devise a secure, reliable and effective mount for each.Note: the twin fans have a limited, max distance placement due to being factory wired to the same harness. Not a problem in \"as intended\" installs, but definite consideration for custom uses. The equipment mine are mounted to are just under 12\" fan-center-to-center and still have slack in the harness.9-days of use and counting summary: my equipment is running FAR cooler than it ever has, and there seems to be far fewer (heat related?) Gremlins in my wired and wireless networks. Very Satisfied and KICKING myself for not getting sooner. Already planning to now install controller, and will be buying more ACI cooling equipment VERY soon to show my AV equipment the same love. Loving it.",

                "reviewText": "These do the job as advertised but there are a couple things I dont like:1. they are wired in series (wired together as one unit). I needed 2 fans independent of each other as the things i needed to cool are further apart than the supplied power cabling.2. the fans are rated at 12v so a faster speed can be applied but the provided brick is 6.5v so the fans will be under powered depending on your use case. I think its 6.5 volts because the inbuilt pwm control might short out at or above 6.5v.3. all of the available mounting holes are populated by rubber feet on both sides of the fans so mounting options are limited without modification.The intended use for these is to place them on top of vent holes of a dvr or stereo system, etc. My use case was for mounting into a server rack which is not a practical application for this particular cooling solution. With some DIY modifications these fans will meet my use case.Overall they are a solid build which will probably last a few years. At full output (6.5v) there is no audible fan noise.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve bought many products from ac infinity over the last 3 months and am very pleased with their products so far. This particular S7-P model is very nice. I\u2019m using it in a grow tent that I have in my bedroom daisy chained with 1 other standard S7 set (one fan in each corner of the 2x4 tent, I drilled small holes in the corner brace plates and zip tied them to the poles) on the night cycle to keep air circulating and they are very quiet, even on the highest setting. They run for 6-12 hours continuous a day and they\u2019re still doing great after 1 month. The air flow will be a little low if the inlet is blocked, ie. placed against a wall, or if the device it\u2019s sitting on doesn\u2019t have good open airflow vents. But in the open it moves a reasonable amount of air (you can feel it from about 5 feet away on the highest setting) and on the lowest setting you can\u2019t even hear it run, even in the quietest rooms. Overall build quality and packaging is great too.Can also be used as a bedside fan for anyone looking for an extremely quiet fan with a light breeze, and with the added flexibility of 2 fans.Pros:- quiet, even on the highest setting- low power consumption with dc motor- great build quality and packaging- able to daisy-chain up to 6 fans- rubber feet are soft and grippy- will definitely keep devices cool- 6.5 volt adapter can be used on other things as well, just make sure you don\u2019t burn out 5v motors after prolonged use- for $35 cdn and free 1 day shipping I\u2019m very pleased, would buy again and recommend- fast shipping and nice packagingCons:- the 6.5v adapter makes the fans loud enough to hear on the highest setting but the room has to be very quiet to hear them. Overall still very quiet- would be nice if the cord between the 2 fans was the standard 3 feet but the 2.5 feet is still very good and accommodating without leaving too much extra cable laying around, but sometimes limiting based on the path/bend of the cable- not really any cons though, overall a great product and company so far5 stars. Would recommend.",
