The three cables from the NA-SEC3 set can be combined for a total length of 1.8m. 4-pin connector The NA-EC3 cables feature a 4-pin connector that works with both 3-pin and 4-pin PWM fans. As such, the cables are fully compatible with all current Noctua 5V, 12V and 24V fans as well as many third-party models. Additionally, thanks to the keyed design of the connector, there is no risk of misaligning 3-pin fans. High-quality black sleeving The NA-EC3 cables come with Noctua\u2019s signature sleeving that is highly resistant against mechanical wear as well as heat and flames (UL 94 V-0 classification). As such, the NA-EC3 cables are suitable for use in critical applications and harsh industrial environments.
