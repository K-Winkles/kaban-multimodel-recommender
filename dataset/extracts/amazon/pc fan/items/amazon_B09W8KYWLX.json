These work great and look good; airflow is decently moderate and sound idk :)Would buy again.Update (5-14-23): All 3 fans have atleast one bugged/glitched LED. Would be a deal breaker for me but I personally don\u2019t stare at my pc; I\u2019ll still give 3 stars for their customer service and price standpoint.",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with these fans. I purchased them for use with an older mATX motherboard that sports only a single 3-pin fan header. This kit comes equipped with a generously long 1-to-3 3-pin fan header connection splitter. The control module is powered by a SATA plug, so you can ditch the old-school Molex connector to a 3-pin header adapter to power your fans if you're short of fan headers on your motherboard like I am. The control module case sports a built-in magnet so you can securely place it in a convenient location in your case. The control module is capable of supporting up to 4 fans, so if you have an ARGB fan on your CPU heatsink, you're all set. It works with modern ARGB motherboards like Gigabyte's RGB Fusion or Asus' Aura solutions. But, for folks sporting non-ARGB motherboards like I am, all you need to do is press the button on top of the control module, and you will cycle through multiple colors and multiple lighting display styles, such as: solid, spiraling or pulsing. As you can see in the images, I opted for a solid rainbow color pattern. As far as noise level goes, they are quieter than the 92mm Artic Cooling CPU heatsink fan, so comparatively, they're silent. ;) The fans themselves are built well. Not as good as some high-end $30 each Corsair I've used, but they are leagues ahead of the fans Cooler Master included with my MasterBox NR400 case. As a nice bonus, all 4 corners of both sides of the fan shroud have rubber to help eliminate noise from fan vibration.It would have been nice if the fans had rotation and airflow arrows on the shroud. The instructions could have been a bit more thorough.",

                "reviewText": "I like these fans, but I opted on my other fans I had previously. While I do like the effect these offer with the mirrored hub, the lack of outer led's was a deal breaker for me. Still, for someone not as obsessed with MORE led's, and wanting a different take on an ARGB fan, these are the perfect fit for that scenario. I also think with these being just a standard 3 wire DC fan, and not a PWM 4 wire fan, you are limited to just using these as air intake and exhaust fans. Which would be fine for a lot of applications, but they are not something I'd use for everything.",
