In fact, it works very well.The cable length is a bit long for my use case, but it I just wrapped the loose ends with some cable ties.The connector is to a usb type a, which is nice because it can be used on most laptops.The connector is compatible with 4 pin PWM fans, but it only has 2 pins, being 12v and ground pins. It uses a potentiometer to control the voltage to the fans.The build quality is quite rigid. Little to no cheap feeling. The controller feels heavy duty, but not water proof or dust proof. It does feel like quality parts were used, however, I noticed that there is some coil whine when using a fan that requires more energy. It's not loud or bothersome, but just something to note.",

I'm assuming the amps just aren't there after the 12V conversion, and I know the issue is not my USB source(s) I've tried. I can't find the amp supply anywhere on the product info as well, sadly.There's also an audible electronic ticking noise that comes from inside the speed controller that is persistent and obnoxious.Just seems underpowered for a 200mm fan.

Die L\u00fcfter gehen an wenn der Laptop angeht und gehen aus wenn der Laptop aus b.z.w. in den Energiesparmodus geht. Man kann mit dem R\u00e4dchen die Geschwindigkeit steuern, was bei meinen L\u00fcftern auch tadellos funktioniert obwohl es eigentlich PWM-L\u00fcfter sind.",
