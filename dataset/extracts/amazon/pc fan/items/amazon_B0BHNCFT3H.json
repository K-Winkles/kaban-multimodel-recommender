                "reviewText": "I bought a pair of these Taidacent 2510-4P fan speed controllers to build my own cooling system for an older ISO Rack that houses my studio PCs. The old system was clunky, noisy and ran 24-7. So I bought two of these to control a pair Noctua 120mm fans in conjunction with a thermostat controller. This allowed me to set the fan speed on each fan to control the airflow and moreover the noise. These worked perfectly and now the enclosure is quieter, cooler and only runs when the temperature exceeds the threshold set on the thermostat. These fan speed controllers are high quality, well packaged and very straight forward to install. Thank you for this excellent product that made my custom build possible!",
