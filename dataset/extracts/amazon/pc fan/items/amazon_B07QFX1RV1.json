                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really good fans for the price. Bright RGB. Low noise. Zero vibration.",
                "reviewText": "These fans are beefy. They feel very sturdy and well made. The 3 fan speed modes make it nearly silent on the low RPM mode. Medium and high speeds can be a bit noisy but with headphones on you can barely hear them. So far they have nearly zero vibration with all 5 installed in my Thermaltake N21 Snow Edition. They definitely move some air on even the lowest RPM mode.The cable management was a nightmare in my case but thats hardly the fan/RGB controllers fault. Set up was super easy just make sure you pay attention to where you plugging cables into. Also I noticed that some of my RGB lights were not working when I set it all up. It turned out I had to flip over the RGB cables that went into the RGB controller. It doesn't have any markings to show how they should be oriented so keep that in mind if you have RGB lights not working. Just flip the cable over.So far I am very happy with these fans. The lighting is pretty bright my only con is you cant adjust the brightness of the LED.On to the MSI Mystic Light Sync: So when I hooked up the 4pin 12v RGB connector to my MSI Tomahawk B450m 12v RGB Header. Things got a bit weird. The LED lights began to spaz out and randomly flicker. But I updated the mystic light software and did some tweaking and WAS ABLE TO GET THESE FANS TO SYNC TO MYSTIC LIGHT. However I can only get them to sync with solid colors. And they seem to be a few milliseconds behind. For example if I set the RGB to breathing. The rest of my RGB will go from red to blue for example. Then then these fans will go to blue about a second after the rest. Then the rest have already moved on to a different color before these RGB fans. So I kind of gave up on getting them to sync correctly and just decided to use the included remote. Luckily my CPU Heatsink RGB is Synapse 3 compatible so I used that to sync everything up. And set the case fans to match.All in all I like these fans. I just wish everyone would decide to get together and make a decision on what RGB header everyone will use.",

                "reviewText": "Comprehensive review below, if you want it short - good performance and appearance for a reasonable cost, along with a good customer service team. Recommended.Had to contact seller to get a replacement controller box and cable - turned out to be the cable not the box. It did take them a about a week to get a replacement to me, but they did and everything works great now. The email support was helpful, responded quickly when contacted and solved my issue without any problems. Really, what more can you ask for when it comes to customer service. A+As for the fans themselves they are quite good for the cost. They have a quality feeling to them, heavy, well made, have some type of nylon around the cables, thats a nice touch. The controller on the other hand is a bit cheap feeling but it does the job. They blow a reasonable amount of air, especially considering the cfm most argb fans have, which is the most important part. I'm using them on an air cooler without any issue. They can unfortunately get a bit loud at higher rpms. At lower speeds they are pretty quiet while still doing a fine job.aesthetically they look fantastic and work great with asrocks argb utility. The stock settings using the controller are actually pretty good too surprisingly. They have a bit of a unique look that I really like personally over the full ring from other brands. The transitions aren't as good as say corsairs, but they're also half the cost so there's that.Cost is what it really comes down to with these fans. They are very reasonable for what you get. They aren't the quietest fans, but they aren't annoyingly loud even at full speed. Along with customer service that actually responds and tries to rectify issues I can absolutely recommend getting these. The box is a bit cheap but considering the quality of the fans and the fact that it does work pretty well its not difficult to overlook that flaw.Original review : Well the controller box on the 5 pack of mine is busted. 2 of the ports cause flickering and two don't work. Tried contacting seller to see if they'll send me a new controller box, if not I'll be returning. I'll say the ones that do work look good, but pretty pointless if they don't all work...",

I have tested these on radiators against other similar styles and more well known brands like noctua and these win out big time time. Ths air they push out at such low dB is amazing to me. Best fan I have tried for rads and case. The leds aren't as noticeable thanks to good diffusion and the colors are nice and vibrant.I did have an issue where one controller of the three I purchased was not registering on the motherboard so I could use pwm mode. Hopefully the replacement works fine. Edit: turns out the pwm fan cable that comes with the controller was the issue. new cable fixed it. Other then that that these are amazing fans. Well built, solid, heavy and a great value.",

I would also like to mention in this pictures I know the LED lights seem dim. I did this because when I turn brightness to maximum it shows LED SPOTS in the picture. Keep in mind it is seamless in real life. The Camera does this. when I Dim it shows no LED spots on the ring in the picture. Either way It is seamless and they can get very bright(bright enough to light up inside case and show every component easily) fans. Very clean and classy. I recommend.I have been using for 1month now, So durability wise Idk yet, but they are high quality so it should be fine.",
