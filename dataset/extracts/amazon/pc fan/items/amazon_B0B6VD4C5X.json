This is a complete mix for me.I actually had ordered this pair twice.The first time it worked great, all the fans light up, good and quite fans, plus the controller worked great, however on my second time. The fans refuse to listen to the controller, and while they work and turn on, and after re arranging cabling, plug ins, and other things, it refuses to work, so I just took away the rgb cables, at least the fans do work.Another note is somehow my mouse also stopped responding to my pc? So now this this whole thing is a mess. Actually quite a lot stopped working, I nearly thought my computer broke.... don't get these fans, spend your money and well known brands.",

Enough to do nearly any PC build (maybe with a fan or two left over depending on your case size)These fans are quiet & actually \"ARGB\" (ARGB = \"Addressable RGB\") in short, ARGB does a LOT more than just \"RGB\" in lighting effects.The RGB around the sides is cool. Plus this pack comes with a neat remote & the controller & all the mounting hardware needed to boot.Very quiet, smooth running well made 6 ARGB fans plus controller. Excellent value.",
