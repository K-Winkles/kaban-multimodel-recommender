                "reviewText": "I have this set up in front of a mist fogger to circulate the humidity in a grow tent for mycology experiments and growing cactus and vegetables. I have the fan and the fogger connected to an Inkbird humidity controller. Bam. There it is, it completes the system. The noise is barely noticeable outside the tent, but of course if you set it on high speed it makes a bit more noise. But overall I am happy with how quiet it is, and the fan speed controller is fantastic also. I also love that the fan and controller connect with a plug, so if either of them go bad, you can easily replace with no wiring necessary. 2 months so far and still working great. That's what you needed to know, right? Happy growing! Helpful?",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for a radio base station which has a tendency to run a tad warm on 45 watts output. Added the fan on top and it keeps cool air flowing through the vents of the radio and power supply. It takes a minute or two to add the upper and lower screen and the rubber feet. The speed control is a great addition to both change the speed of the fan up and down which ties into the fans noise. I run the fan at a little less than halfway (low noise) but turn it up for long transmission times (loudest). It appears to work great keeping the radio components cool. It does not move from its position sitting on the rubber feet on top of the radio cabinet. The radio is just beneath the top which is vented. The power supply has its own fan on the bottom of the cabinet. The radio is a Kenwood TK-8360hu-k and the cabinet is a Samlex SEC-1223-TK3 (23 amp) with a Kenwood KMC-35 IP55 microphone. I would buy this again for another radio. Note: on high speed, the fan noise isn't all that loud and it does provide a comfortable cool breeze around the cabinet as well.",

                "reviewText": "This fan is bigger than I expected, even though I saw the dimensions before ordering. That said, it's working exactly as I hoped it would, cooling some computer equipment that tends to run warm by blowing some air across it. I chose this particular fan because of the controls, which are not part of the brick that plugs into the outlet and are fully adjustable from very low RMP to very high. The fan is quiet, but as you turn it higher (i.e. higher voltage/RPM), the fan does get louder. But that's the nature of the fan. This is basically the same type of fan you'd find in a computer, modified to connect to AC power, with two metal screens and some feet. It\u2019s nothing pretty to look at, but functional. The main reason I'm only rating it 4 stars is that the brief instructions that were included are not relevant to this product, so essentially there are no instructions. It's not that I couldn't figure it out, but I'm an instruction guy and expect something basic.",

Keeps the radio much cooler. I am very happy with this product. The price was so reasonable I didn't have to take the time to manufacture something myself.
