The buzzing from my fridge is louder, so we don't really notice this slight noise unless we get up close and personal with the air purifier.I have left this thing running since the day we got it (2-3 months or so ago). I'll note that we haven't had a significant illness sweep through our house since we've had it, so I'll go ahead and use that to justify the price. Can you really put a price on your health?I discovered the Puraclenz when we were on vacation in St. Croix....the hotel room had one running and my husband noticed that I slept much better with the white noise this unit produced. I noted what it was, then came home to research and consequently, spent all of our kids' college funds on this small unit. \"For the health of the family\", I said!I liked that it touted the idea of sending ions out to kill mold spores. We haven't noticed any mold in our house, so that's good. Also, upon coming home from a week-long trip, the house smelled fantastic! I guess this was able to really clean the air while we were away.All in all, it's hard to know if it's just a gimmick or if it is actually helping improve our air quality (I don't have a fancy way to measure that!). My mental health is on the up and up - just by the thought of this thing keeping our house's air pure and clean. And for that, it's a peace of mind that I think was worth the cost.",

                "reviewText": "I was shocked when I received this purifier. I bought it for my basement, which is just under 1,200 sq ft.This purifier is supposed to work for 1,500 sq ft but I'd be surprised if it could clean air in a closet, must less a room.I gave it a try for a week, plugged it in, the green light came on. I didn't detect any air movement at all.After a week I unplugged it, as this item doesn't have any switch for on off (what a joke).The filter was pure white as if never used. And I had this in my basement, which has plenty of dust.I returned this and thankfully got a refund.Currently I have these two types of room type purifiers -1. Holmes True HEPA Allergen Remover Mini Tower Air Purifier with Optional Ionizer( I don't use the ionizer because of Ozone). This purifier has a true HEPA filter, on off switch, 3 speed settings and is a work horse. It's not fancy, but it is dependable and affordable. I keep the one in bedroom on all the time. One for my office and one in living room. You can literally see a reduction in dust (I don't have to dust as often) and I breath so much easier!2. The PuroAir HEPA 14 Air Purifier for Pets - Covers 1,115 Sq Ft Also affordable!because of it's HEPA 14 filter. Have this in my (large) dining room area. I keep it on all the time.It has multiple switches, is attractive, and this room has much less dust in it now.It's still too soon for me to just this filter, after just a few weeks, but it seems to be doing a good job, does move air",

                "reviewText": "Our house has pretty good airflow, but our partially finished basement has always had a musty smell, not mold from what tests show, but we have dogs that hang out down there, and it just smells like a basement I guess. I saw these advertised on Facebook and heard they were good from some friends who have one, so I decided to try it out. I was skeptical because it's so small, like really, really small. I got the middle size unit and put it in the finished part of the basement. Within two days, there was a notable reduction in the smell. I moved it into the unfinished area, which has more of a smell, but within a couple of days, that smell was gone.I'm shocked at how well this little thing works. I work from the finished basement area and while it was in there, I could hear it but it was quiet enough that it was barely noticeable. I have no doubt that it's working because the basement no longer smells. I just wish they had something that could be installed on my HVAC system :)I've used larger purifiers before, and they're usually large, loud, and I never felt like they worked. This one has got to use less electricity than those, it is pretty quiet as mentioned above (at least the middle size one is quiet), and its compact size makes it easy to move around and keep out of the way.It does come with a mounting plate, so you could hang it from a ceiling or wall....I don't think I'll use that, but I'm sure someone has a use case for it.If you're on the fence, get one of these, I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the mid-size unit P1500 and am pleased with its performance. I use it in conjunction with a number of HEPA filtration units which cover a considerably smaller area than the Puraclenz. They perform different functions.I am a smoker and this unit performs well in removing smoke particulates from the air. While Amazon's community guidelines do not permit health claims in reviews, the air in my home smells fresher and I am no longer the subject of complaint in our household.I encourage you to give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "After the initial order kept getting delayed via Amazon, it eventually never got delivered. I contacted Amazon and its was \"lost\" in shipment along with another model of the same I too ordered. Amazon then sent them out and 2-days ago they both arrived. I plugged it in and in less than a minute the green light turned red. I unplugged it, and it went green only to turn red again. It is not working when a red light displays. Very disappointed considering the cost and I have now purchased 3 of these product, the larger having the problem",
