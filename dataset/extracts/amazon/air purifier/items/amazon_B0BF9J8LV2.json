                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Pro Large air purifier by Galanz is a wonderfully modern and effective purifier. With its super quite auto mode and highly effective purification, you should definitely consider this one. Here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned while owning it and things to consider before buying.I. Features \u2013 It can adapt to changing air qualities on the fly. The auto mode, and HEPA filter combine to really clean the air out. The sleep mode is great if you are using it in your bedroom, you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s on and it turns the lights out. Only downside is I forget sometimes that it\u2019s on and leave it on all day, while I\u2019m gone. The best feature is the auto mode, that will go high if needed, but once the air quality is under control, it\u2019s so quite you won\u2019t even hear it usually. It also has a light on the top with different colors to represent different air qualities in the room.II. Quality \u2013 It feels like it\u2019s made out of good quality materials, that I would think will last a long time. The leather lift handle is a nice touch and look good, but the white plastic exterior doesn\u2019t live up to the price tag.III. Size \u2013 This thing is big at 20in. tall, but it also comes with big performance to match.Overall, despite the size of this purifier it\u2019s worth it. I own many purifiers and this one goes in my bedroom, because of the features and performance. I just put it on auto mode and it takes care of the rest quietly and efficiently, always providing me fresh, clean, great smelling air. I highly recommend this one, unless the size is an issue for your application. So far everything has works as they intended, but if I ever start to have problems with it, I\u2019ll be sure to update this review.If you\u2019d find it helpful to see a visual inspection of this product, I recommend you watch my included video in full screen. They say a picture is worth a 1000 words, well it\u2019s a video!You can trust that this review is simply my honest opinion that is attempting to provide you with helpful insight that I wish I had before I picked this product. Hopefully it was helpful in your decision.",

I replaced the filter as I\u2019ve read this can be a notifier that it\u2019s time to replace the filter, but the beeping is still occurring. I wish I could continue to use this because it is great white noise for sleep and it works well for the price, but the beeping is too annoying for me.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve mainly known Galanz for their stylish refrigerators and microwaves and was not surprised to see that their personal air purifier was also very attractive. It looks so modern and beautiful - especially with the carrying handle. While the handle does not look like real leather, it does seem like it is durable. I\u2019m also very grateful that it does not light up with blue, purple or other obnoxious lights like some other air purifiers. I like my appliances discreet. All the better to blend in with my decor.I\u2019m very impressed by just how quiet this Galanz air purifier is. I have another large air purifier (for 700 square foot rooms) that is wonderful but louder. I barely even notice the Galanz is in the room and running most of the time, and am almost surprised to see it there. That\u2019s how quiet it is. It\u2019s great for bedrooms, for this reason.Set up is really easy and took only a few minutes. You just have to unscrew the air purifier, unwrap the filter, and put it back in.You also have the option to add your own scent to the aromatherapy pad in the scent chamber. However, this was perhaps the least impressive feature to me. Perhaps I have become spoiled by my aromatherapy diffuser but I didn\u2019t feel that the scent chamber made much of a discernible difference. I added what must have been 15 to 18 drops of Cedarwood essential oil and neither my husband nor I could smell anything (we started with 8 drops and kept adding more and more, but nothing made a difference). We felt that we wasted our essential oil in the end.So far, the Galanz air purifier seems to work well for our bedroom. I have a lot of allergies (animal dander, dust, tree/grass/flower/weed pollen, etc.) as well as asthma. Both my allergies and asthma have been doing well with the Galanz personal air purifier in our bedroom and our larger air purifier in our living room. This is with two cats in our household as well.Our bedroom also seems to smell better because the air purifier seems to neutralize stale smells.I\u2019ll update if anything changes but so far, I would recommend this as a personal air purifier.",
