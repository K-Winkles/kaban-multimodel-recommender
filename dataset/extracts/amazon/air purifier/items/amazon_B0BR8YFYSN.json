                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Air purifiers are niche products nowadays but you won't realize the advantage of having such a product in the home until you use it at your home and see the dirt being collected in the filters while doing regular cleaning of the product. I already have 2 bigger air purifiers in my home that clean our living area and bedroom respectively. Got this to use in our small office room since we tend to use that room regularly due to working from home. I have used it for the last few days now and here is my take. I would highly recommend this product. It is one of the fanciest small purifiers I have ever seen.My 2 cents below:Pros:- It does the job of an air purifier very well as we can feel the difference in the dust in the office room- Different levels of fan control. You won't hear anything when on speed1 or in sleep mode. Very silent- 3-layer filtration in this product air purification\u2013 \u0421apture smoke, dust, odors, and allergens- Very fancy looks and gives a great aesthetic to the home while in use- Timer functionality is nice to have with 6 settings (2h/4h/6h/8h/10h/12h) available- Overall it is quiet, even at the highest fan speed. Refer to my attached video- Aromathy pad section that lets you add essential oils in it for fragrance. This is something that I have seen very first time in any air purifier- Great build quality and feels very premium- Detailed manual with all steps and troubleshooting details- The manufacturer provides a 1-year warrantyCons:- I wish it had smart WiFi connectivity to control it remotely or at least a remote control was included- No real-time AQI (Air Quality Index) numbers are displayed to keep informed. Both of my other purifiers do show those and it is convenient to have a track on it. No auto mode in these purifiers, so I believe it misses the sensor that detects the air quality index",

                "reviewText": "I've had this in my basement bathroom / washroom for over a month now, and it does exactly what I need it to and does it well. Unfortunately, our downstairs basement bathroom does not have any sort of fan to turn on so any smells tend to linger. On top of that there can be some funny smells from the shower drain and this filter purifier fixes that right up. I really like the control system and all the different options and button layout. The silent mode really is extremely quiet but still can get some work done while at the same time the highest setting can clear out the smell from a room very quickly without being insanely loud. The design looks really nice and the handle is appreciated. The little scent tray is nice and with just two drops of an oil that'll last up to 3 days, it just depends if you're constantly running it or only turn it on when you need it. I also really appreciate the ability to check how much time is left on your filter so you know once it has essentially expired.",

                "reviewText": "One of the standout features for me is its effectiveness in combating pet odors and allergens, making it a must-have for households with furry companions. The purifier's sleek design seamlessly integrates into any room decor, and its compact size is perfect for bedrooms or smaller living spaces. What sets it apart is its thoughtful timer function, which allows me to set it for specific periods, ensuring that it's not running unnecessarily throughout the day.For someone like me who's conscious of energy consumption, this feature is a game-changer. It strikes the perfect balance between efficiency and functionality, ensuring optimal air quality without wasting electricity. But perhaps the most significant benefit is its impact on air quality, especially for those prone to allergies or asthma. Since incorporating the Tolife Air Purifier into my bedroom, I've noticed a marked improvement in air freshness and overall respiratory comfort. It effectively captures airborne particles and pollutants, creating a healthier indoor environment for rest and relaxation.For anyone seeking relief from allergens or pollutants, or simply looking to breathe easier at home, I highly recommend the Tolife Air Purifier. It's a worthwhile investment in both comfort and well-being, supporting a cleaner, fresher living space for you and your loved ones.",
