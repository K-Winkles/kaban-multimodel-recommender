Just looked and \"official\" Mooka Replacement filters, are like $46 bucks, but you can get the same on amazon from others for like $22. Instructions say change every 3 - 6 months. Me being a smoker (trying to quit), I will probably change every 4-5 months. The blue light is a nice touch. The aromatherapy diffuser doesn't seem to be doing much for me, and I soaked the hell out of that pad. I noticed there is no holes at the bottom for air to flow through the pad, so I guess suction from air passing over is suppose to move the aroma. I am tempted to drill a few tiny holes, maybe heat up a needle and poke some tiny holes, I'm not sure yet. I can live without that part anyway. Plus me being a smoker, I may just not be noticing it. Anyway, I like this product, and may get a couple more for two other rooms.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to get an air purifier for my home because of lingering cooking smells and just a general musty odor. I decided to give it a shot the other night when making dinner. The whole 1st floor smelled strongly of garlic and onions, so I figured it was a good starting point. After 10 minutes of running the food smell cleared away. Even after having to leave the house for a while, when I came back it didn\u2019t smell. I also ran it overnight and noticed a massive difference the next morning in that the room didn\u2019t smell musty anymore. The instructions are clear and this is very easy to operate. It\u2019s not too loud on the highest setting and would be great to have in a bedroom as well.",

                "reviewText": "This air purifier works great, I love how compact it is so it's great to sit on a shelf, bookcase etc. It may be small but it's mighty, the timer function works great, and the night light is genius. The night light is blue light and can be turned on or off while the machine is running I prefer on because it provides a nice ambiance. We keep air purifiers in our home since we have a pet and this one is great.",
