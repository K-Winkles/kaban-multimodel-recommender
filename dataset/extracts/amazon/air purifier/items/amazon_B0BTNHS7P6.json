Ended up being good timing as the air quality went from green to brown category in two days! It did a pretty good job of keeping the air quality better off for them.I was glad to hear considering her, the little nephew and niece would have an easier time of the horrible air quality! Even though it doesn't move the most air the filter seemed to do a great job over some other filters I have when it comes to some of the stuff given off by forest fires. Having said that my impression of the thing is pretty good. Fires and smoke are a good gauge and it did great!",

                "reviewText": "Dust and such is everywhere. My belief is the more you can capture and lock away the better it is for you, your home, and more important these days is it better for your electronics and appliances. I've tried a number of different brands and styles of air filters over the years. But as they age, parts break and filters become impossible to find. And you'll find yourself in need of a replacement unit.There is one test I like to perform on a new air filter unit when I first get it. This is the \"smoke\" test. This isn't all that scientific. I use an incense stick to create smoke so I can observe how far away a filter can pull in the smoke. I also test it from different angles. The other part of testing with smoke is it creates a odor and which can help test the carbon element in the filter.I'm happy to report this filter met my expectations. It could pull the smoke from more than a 1 foot away (might not sound like much, but it's good). Also after about 10 minutes, the aroma had noticeably been reduced; a good sign that the carbon filtering is working.All in all very please with this unit. It compares well to brands like Levoit (Vista series) both in terms of upfront pricing as well as performance.One feature which I have used on this unit but is not a feature I have on any of the other room filters I own presently is the aroma therapy. Just 1 drop of essential oil into the sponge area for this can fill a room with a fragrance of your choosing. Not only will your air be scrubbed for you and your guests, but you can help set the mood for the evening.Please note: I was not able to readily locate replacement filters as of yet. I'm hopeful the vendor will make those available shortly. However for this reason, I'm unable to comment about the total cost of ownership.",

                "reviewText": "This air purifier is promoted for use in large rooms to filter out unwanted air particles and remove odors. It can also be used as a night light. It comes with three fans and has three timing functions of 4, 8, and 12 hrs.We use it in our bedroom next to my wife\u2019s bed for at least 8 hrs every night. My wife has significant allergies during the pollen season. Her allergies are disruptive to her sleep because of breathing issues. At the time of this writing, we\u2019ve used the Fitnate air purifier almost three weeks. During that time, my wife complained less about her nighttime allergy troubles than before we started using this air purifier. Her comfort level is the only way I have to measure the effectiveness of the air purifier. The air seems a little cleaner and her allergy complaints are down.Things we like:When we turn it on high, it\u2019s less noisy than another filtration system we occasionally use in our bedroom. The emitted sound at any speed is a satisfying background noise for sleeping.The three timing functions let us \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d I don\u2019t have to run back to the bedroom to check if I turned it off before leaving for the office.Things we don\u2019t know:Besides the vendor\u2019s filter, we don\u2019t know if an alternative replacement filter is available. We couldn\u2019t find one online using the vendors' filter number.We can certainly recommend this air purifier to others.",

It makes a huge difference between regular air purifiers and I like its 2 in 1 functions. I think it does its job well besides some little improvements. First, The power cord is in the middle not on the bottom of machine. I think usually we have it set on the bottom for a cleaner design. Second, timer and wind speed share the same light indicator. I\u2019ll get confused if I set up the timer or not. Most machines have separated light indicators for timer and fan speed. The least time of timer is 4 hours which is too long, my other air purifier has at least 1 or 2 hours timer setting. Third, the light is inside the machine and only on and off setting which is not very useful. But it\u2019s not a big issue since I have a night light on. Overall, I like this 2 in 1 air purifier.",
