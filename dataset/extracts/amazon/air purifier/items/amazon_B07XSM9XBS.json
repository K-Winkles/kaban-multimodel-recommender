                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet, powerful, smart HEPA device.",
                "reviewText": "I bought two of these to help keep the air in our home cleaner especially with wildfire smoke in late summer/early fall and having a purifier with a HEPA filter is necessary when you\u2019re dealing with that. My favorite things about it is it was easy to put together (take plastic off of filters and unit) then plug it in and let it run about 30 min for the first time. It\u2019s got an Auto feature that is sensitive to changes in air quality indoors and will auto adjust the fan power and display a different color to indicate the air quality. I like how quiet it is, and how it auto dims when the room is dark so the bright display light isn\u2019t a bother, either. As others have mentioned you can put the unit right against the wall because it draws air in through the front of the unit and out the top, which is great if you don\u2019t want it in the middle of a room where you have to worry about tripping over a cord. I chose this unit over the next model up from Bissell because I felt like having an actual AQI number displayed might make me obsess over having that much info and I felt like having a color system was a bit more calming \u201cblue = good\u201d \u201cyellow = moderate\u201d \u201cred = unhealthy\u201d sometimes less data is a good thing - plus you can always look up the AQI online easily if you really need to know (some websites even offer AQI forecasts so you know when you may need to bust one of these babies out to use them!)My only qualm with the unit is there isn\u2019t really a super easy way to carry it from room to room because of the design of it. If they redesign these at any point they could make a kind of sneaky indented handle situation in the recessed areas on the front and back of the unit so you can carry it with two hands would be good.",

                "reviewText": "This filter does its job, and it does it incredibly well.This investment, to protect your lungs during a respiratory pandemic, is absolutely a no brainer.Having real time air quality data, via the color light indicator, is an absolute perfect addition.It's a data driven approach, being able to know the air is of good quality or not.The filters are thick, heavy duty, and way more impressive than others on the market.I did significant research, and looked extensively into similar options at slightly different price points.However, you will not find an option, with better filters, which cost this little to replace.$35 every 6 months? Are you kidding? Look up any of the cheaper, other brand name top sellers here on amazon, you'll usually find a cost of $60 to $80 for a single filter replacement, which, regardless of filter, is generally replaced on a semi annual basis. These filters are quality. Bissell isn't messing around.Additionally, I'm a huge fan of good design. I was considering paying $100 more for the white version, because I have a very modern sky rise apartment, which keeps me keen to consider design always. However, after reading another review, I realized that having the actual *number* of your AQI versus a simple color, would probably make me a little neurotic. I like knowing the air is either good, moderate, or bad... but seeing the actual number... that might actually make me a little too obsessive.I did want to talk too about the sound. On the highest setting, sleeping with it right beside my bed, it's blissful. It sounds like a white noise machine and never gets too loud for me. I love it. I generally prefer the second to the highest setting. I'd like to add that there's an incredible night time feature, which I think auto detects lighting or something, but all lighting on the unit turns off when the surrounding lights are off. I'm beyond impressed. It's so nice to not have to cover any lights up on the unit.This product, is an absolute design award worthy product. The quality, the consideration of each component, the technology and the effectiveness have me shook. Great work Bissell. I'm a huge fan.I'm incredibly satisfied. I have a 700sq ft apartment but am considering a second unit just for the hell of it. Feels like I'm living in a Tesla model X on the bio defense air filtration mode.An incredible purchase. Don't hesitate.",

                "reviewText": "APPEARANCES:It\u2019s big. The size immediately stands out when you open it. But that\u2019s something understood for a purifier that\u2019s purifies up to 800 sq ft. It\u2019s sleek and beautiful. If you can find a nice place for, it looks great.SETUP:This equipment is extremely easy to setup. Install the filters it comes with. Plug it in. Press the power button, let it automatically calibrate and then it\u2019s good to go.PERFORMANCE:It has 5 manually modes. When all the way up on 5, the fan can be heard. It\u2019s a bearable sound though, like a nice ambient sound. At the lowest fan speed, you can\u2019t hear it at all. It\u2019s definitely whisper quiet. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to run it at the highest fan speed 99% of the time. The automatic mode is the best option. The particle sensor that is said to detect air quality seems to work pretty well, and it will automatically adjust fan speed based on its readings.Almost two weeks in, and the difference is noticeable. I\u2019m in an apartment less than 700 sq ft. Two people. The accumulation of dust on furniture has been significantly reduced. I\u2019m not an allergy sufferer, but my partner is. It appears to be helping reduce the allergens causing her flair ups, but more time is needed to solidify this claim.OVERALL:I\u2019ve never spent money on an air purifier, let alone this kind of money. But I bit the bullet and gave it a try, and it\u2019s well worth the money. Between the purifier and the top of the line Honeywell Filter I use for my HVAC system, the air quality in my apartment is optimal",
