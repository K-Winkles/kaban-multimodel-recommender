                "reviewText": "I like this purifier. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure how to measure if it actually works, but I do feel like the air just feels fresher. My twins started kindergarten in the fall and I felt like we were constantly getting sick so I was looking for ways to help with that. Our bedroom also seems to get dusty very quickly. I still don\u2019t know how to quantify how well the purifier works, but it does seem to help.The buttons stay lit up while on, which give a night light type of glow (cool white, not warm amber color light). If you like total darkness while sleeping, just be aware of that. It has two settings while running. The first level provides a nice airy sound that is a perfect little white noise to help sleep (it\u2019s not a buzz or a hum\u2026it\u2019s more like the soft sound of air flow). Personally, the second level is too noisy for me so we just use it on the first level and are happy with that.It\u2019s not tiny, but it\u2019s isn\u2019t a huge appliance either. Should fit easily on most night stands. I do think it is stylish, no weird shapes or colors. Very plain, simple, classy design. Overall, happy with the product. It does come in a set of two. I\u2019d rather buy one at a time based on my needs, but we could always use it in another room.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to order these air purifiers as I wanted my rooms to feel refreshed. My gym uses powerful air purifiers and it never has the smelly gym atmosphere. I figured I wanted my home to have that fresh feel as well. These purifiers do an excellent job in that regards. It operates in a quiet fashion and does the job without notice. It has 3 modes (Hi, Low and Sleep mode). I love the sleep mode as when I wake up in the morning, my room just feels very clean with that fresh air feel about it.These purifiers come in packs of 2 and are a breeze to set up and actually look pretty cool. Some of my friends have commented on the high tech look of them. I have seasonal allergies and maybe its my imagination but I feel my allergies are minimal to none since using this item.It also has a area on top where you can add fragrance oils if that's your thing. Personally, I like the no scent fresh air. What else can I say about this product other than if you're in the market for air purifiers for your home...then these should be on the top of your list. Happy breathing :)",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for an effective way to improve air quality in multiple rooms, the CHIVALZ Air Purifiers HY1800 is a great option. This model comes in a convenient package of 2 compact yet powerful purifiers designed for small to medium-sized spaces.I've been running a unit in both my bedroom and home office for the past couple of weeks and have already noticed a reduction in dust and allergens. The true HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns, while the activated carbon filter helps remove odors.These purifiers operate very quietly, with noise levels as low as 24dB on sleep mode, so they don't disturb me at night. I love the modern, minimalist design and intuitive touch controls. At this price point, getting 2 effective air purifiers with true HEPA filtration is an incredible value.If you're looking to improve the air in multiple rooms in your home, I highly recommend picking up the 2-pack of the CHIVALZ HY1800. It's a great affordable solution for cleaner indoor air and better health.",

                "reviewText": "I recieved my two filers packaged nicely. They are smaller than I expected so very sleek and modern looking. They did not stand out in my room which I appreciated!I put the first one in my teenage sons room (because theres all kinds of unknown smells in there!) And I noticed within 24 hours that there was a considerable less boy stinch in his room! After 10 days it smells like the rest of the house!The second one I put in the back room where we keep our dogs. We have 4 extra large breed dogs and my biggest fear is my house smells like dog! So when we are gone they are crated in their own room. Again, the same thing, a couple days in there and I immedately noticed a lack of dog smell. And to be honest I have noticed less dust on the floor as well! So much power from a little box!Seriously considering getting two more for the living room and master bedroom. I will say, dont set it close to a scentsy because I bet it will neutralize that too! Super impressed and Highly Recommend!!",

Love the aromatherapy feature where you can add your favorite drops if you enjoy pleasant, atmospheric scents wafting through your room. We use one in the kitchen where the dog eats and sleeps. Masks/eliminates food and pet odors very effectively. 3-stage filtration with HEPA gives you confidence in a cleaner, healthier environment. Simple touch controls make it a no-brainer if simplicity is important to you. Highly recommended, especially at this price. it it's a winner.",

The sleep mode is nice because the little light on it will turn off but it still runs. I have two cats in a small apartment so it gets stuffy sometimes with all of the living bodies, and these have made the air so fresh. It\u2019s also snatching some of the cat hair from the air which is nice. It\u2019s obviously not gonna work like the big $200 air purifiers, but for the cost, and the fact you get two, I\u2019m more than satisfied.",
