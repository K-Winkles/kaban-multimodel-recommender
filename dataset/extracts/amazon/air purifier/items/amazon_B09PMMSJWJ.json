It comes with a 1 year warranty so it is also safe to say that there won\u2019t be any problem until a year. I\u2019m not sure how long it will actually last but from the build quality and proper handling, I\u2019d say it should last a good 2-2.5 years. I checked the filters and i can estimate that we need to change these once every 4-5 months of 8 hours/day usage (based on my usage). Obviously, it depends on what kind of environment you\u2019re using the purifier for. Also, it is pretty quiet at the medium setting (sound level is around 12-14 dB). It could be a little annoying for some people at high setting. But overall, it is what one can expect from a product if this price range.",

                "reviewText": "A comparison would be with the Winix 5500 that I currently use in my apartment.The device has a compact footprint and looks quite stylish and modern. Dyson handheld vacuum for comparison. It was easy to set up. I only had to remove the plastic wrap from the two filters inside of the air purifier and plug it in.When running the air purifier at low, it is nearly silent. The noise ramps up as you go from setting 2\u20134 at the highest it is comparable to the noise of the Winix at level 4. Of course, air exchange cannot be directly compared; this is half the size of my other air purifier. The airflow at setting three on my previous air purifier is about the same as the highest on this one.I don\u2019t think I would be using the lights since it is in a bedroom where excess light is not good for sleep. Did not try the app or Wi-Fi connection since I put the air purifier on the automatic mode. Cannot comment on the sensitivity of the sensor quite yet at this time. May update it later.The air purifier consumables apparently last about three months per the labeling. The carbon and HEPA filter are not separate so you would have to exchange both at the same time. There is a pre-filter on the HEPA side rather than the carbon side, which may cause the HEPA filter to clog before the carbon filter is exhausted. This is the opposite of the Winix air purifier. The plug is also a transformer which can take up more space on a power outlet. I also hope that future purchases of the replacement HEPA filters will not be an issue with a smaller company.",

I noticed it was never changing off of 10, which, you know, things change and that should at least vary a little. Especially in a small room with a litter box. So I intentionally sprayed some different cleaners near it, which used to set it off...nothing.I went to get new filters, thinking maybe that was the issue. They'll take weeks to get here and are outrageously overpriced. There doesn't seem to be any officially compatible brand, and I don't want to pay half of what I paid for this every six months max.Maybe I got a dud. But, my cheap purifiers seem to do much better work.---I got this for my basement, a space with so much dust in the air that people have had asthma attacks from just being in there. This says the air quality is great! DEFINITELY not.Meanwhile, I put it in a room with totally normal air quality, no issues ever, and it has a number so high you'd think I had it in an animal shelter where someone just burned popcorn, so there's smoke everywhere. Like, \"how are you not dead?\" bad quality.And when I originally did it in this room just yesterday? It was at 10, which is really good quality. Today, it's shown at at over 700. I understand variations, but sheesh!The manual offers no troubleshooting suggestions, and their website doesn't offer help for this product.So, I just don't think I trust it. But I do think it's purifying the air, so returning it may be more of a hassle than it's worth?Adding: Put a photo on. It's in an enclosed closet that stores paint, glue, etc. and probably hasn't been cleaned in over 10 years after being left like this by previous owners. It's got spiders, dust, mouse poop, some evidence of mold, and, of course, paint fumes. I wanted to take care of the air before I dug in. It says 9, which is superb air quality. In my regularly cleaned living room, it said the quality was so bad I should probably be dead. Again...not sure I trust it.",

I bough it for my one year old baby, since sometime the neibor smokes and the smell always flies in the baby's room. This purifer only take 10 min to refresh the air of the room. The purifier is very compact but it has two filters which doulbles the air flow and refresh faster than I though. Furthermore, it has a night light which is very usefule at night and it looks very nice! They clean the air beautifully. I am beyond pleased with the results",

The device doesn\u2019t compromise on looks either - its stylish design fits nicely into modern interiors, proving to be not just functional but also pleasing to the eye.An added bonus is the accompanying app, which offers a convenient way to control the purifier. It runs smoothly and seems well-integrated, providing a user-friendly experience.The one area where I harbor some doubt is the trustworthiness of the PM2.5 sensor. While it\u2019s hard to verify its accuracy without professional testing equipment, the device seems to respond appropriately to changes in air quality. So while I\u2019m unsure about the precise accuracy of the sensor readings, it appears to do its job adequately.Overall, I would recommend this air purifier for anyone in search of a device that blends effectiveness, good looks, and tech-savvy features. The sensor\u2019s accuracy might be a question mark, but it doesn\u2019t deter from the purifier\u2019s overall performance.",
