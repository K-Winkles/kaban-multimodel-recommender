Its compact design makes it suitable for smaller spaces, effectively reducing allergens and odors. The user-friendly controls simplify operation, with multiple fan speeds catering to varying needs. The filter replacement process is straightforward, ensuring minimal hassle in maintenance.While the purifier performs admirably in removing common pollutants, a slightly quieter operation would enhance its appeal. At higher fan speeds, the noise level becomes noticeable. Nevertheless, the sleep mode is a thoughtful feature, providing a quieter option for nighttime use.The energy efficiency of this air purifier is praiseworthy, contributing to its eco-friendly profile. The aesthetic design seamlessly blends into any room decor. However, a filter replacement indicator would be a valuable addition for timely maintenance.Overall, this small room air purifier strikes a balance between performance and convenience. With some refinements in noise levels and the addition of filter replacement alerts, it could easily earn a higher rating. It remains a reliable choice for those seeking an efficient air purifier tailored for compact living spaces.",

                "reviewText": "This thing puts in WORK!!!We had a cat in our home who would pee literally everywhere. Even after paying over $200 to have the carpets professionally cleaned AND ripping up the carpet pad underneath and replacing, it STILL smelled like pee in our home.We positioned the purifier near the most offensive area, put two drops of a \u201cclean\u201d scented oil, and you cannot smell the urine AT ALL. This thing genuinely saved my sanity.It does make sound, but it\u2019s not incredibly loud. It\u2019s like a nice ambient background noise. Quieter than the dishwasher or washing machine, probably as loud as a small desk fan.Doesn\u2019t take up too much room either. We put it in the corner and it\u2019s never gotten remotely in the way.",

The essential oil part is more of an eh, it is nice to use it, but doesn't hold scent like an essential oil diffuser does. It is quiet and easy to clean, able to vacuum the outside and the filter for the loose hair. Nice to have in both the bedroom and the office.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to help with the air quality in my old home due to my allergies. I was looking to replace a small tabletop air purifier with this one. I got it on sale for $36ish , down from the original of 60 something. If I had paid full price I'd have been very disappointed, it's quite a small unit. I was not aware it was another table top size. That might be my own oversight, but disappointed nonetheless.The essential oil diffuser indeed does not work, I'm not sure the UV is really a UV.Yes, the unit does work overall, only moderate noise on the high function , and it did seem to improve the air quality in the day or so I've used it in my bedroom. Can't speak on longevity of item as I haven't had it long. In a pinch for a small area it works, but I feel the original price is much too high considering the size of item.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased three of these for my home and other than the fact that recently (after my purchase) they increased the coupon from $5 to $10 off costing me $15 more I am still very pleased with the purchase. I must admit that I did not realize that if I did not set the timer that the units would run continuously which is what I had wanted. The fan on 2 or 3 does have noticeable ( though not disturbing) sound but at 1 is almost silent. Filters are super easy to replace and cost far less than most for these devices. I have monitor to test particulates etc. and so far these appear to be doing what I want. In my bedroom for some reason dust accumulates faster than rest of the house and after a month of use notice a significant reduction in the dust in the room. In fact none where usually would have to dust every week. This unit will only cover 254 square feet of room so keep that in mind if considering. If your use is like mine then I can high recommend this unit. Recently one of the three units stopped working and I was afraid that I would have to use warranty but realized that I needed to hold the power button down longer as I had apparently turned unit off accidentally as wall switch shut off current to the outlet. Working fine again. Also I noted comment about the aromatherapy tray. I do not use that as there are warning about using these if you have pets. I did before knowing that try one and I also noticed it seemed to cause me sinus issues. The aroma was very slight but noticeable. Now with my dog I would not use this out of concern for her.",
