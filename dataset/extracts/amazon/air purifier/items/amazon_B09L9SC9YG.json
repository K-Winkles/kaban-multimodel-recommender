                "reviewText": "I just received this unit two days ago and placed it in my new home office/studio. First, it is a bit noisy, but all blowers make noise or they wouldn't circulate air. I placed it in the far corner and set it on \"Auto\" mode which is advertised as the setting that controls the unit - according to the quality of air in the room. Here's where it gets very interesting. I have a globe bulb lamp in my special studio that is opaque inside with a glossy surface outside. It's quite beautiful and diffuses the light perfectly. After about a year, the globe had a 2\" round dark spot inside so I had to remove and clean it. The challenge with the cleaning is that the globe drys water-spotted inside so I use Isopropyl alcohol to rinse it eliminate spotting. I reinstalled the globe which was obviously still wet (inside) with alcohol... which I allow to self dry. Lo and behold, the air cleaner turned Red and went into Turbo mode all by itself. The lamp globe was 3' away and on top of a 2' table and the cleaner was on the floor. I timed it and it ran 34 minutes before returning back to low speed auto mode. The sensor worked! BTW: I like the \"white\" smell along with a minor \"white\" noise...all good. Update: The Pre-Filter (I bought a pack of 4) is not the \"T\" filter which is what I wanted for pet odors and VOC removal. After way too much time searching herein, I had to go to Honeywell site and buy one there...$36. The \"T\" filter fits against (in front of) the main White filter so, altogether to obtain the ultimate filtration, this unit must have Three (3) filters installed.",

Being happy with the quality & durability of the 1st unit, made sense to order a smaller one.Junior sits pretty quietly in the corner, doing its air cleaning duties. Only twice has kicked into overdrive for a few minutes during the day. This coincided with the increase of road construction equipment & truck traffic about 1/2 block away. Noticed a big difference within 3 days, with dust levels down significantly. I'm not so sniffly with seasonal allergies now too first thing in the morning.",

                "reviewText": "I use this purifier to keep the air in my home office clean. I recently grilled some meat indoors and the kitchen got too smoky (almost set the smoke alarm off). The smoke went almost everywhere in my house, including my home office, which is about 200 feet from my kitchen. I turned on the purifier and set it to auto, to test whether it would detect the smoke and pollutants in the air. It did:. It cycled through its colors at the top of the unit until it settled on green, then upped the fan speed and changed the color to yellow. After running for about 30 minutes, the color changed to green. The office smelled a little like smoke before I used the purifier; afterwards, it smelled a lot less.This purifier has three fan speeds, and the lowest speed is loud. I have a bigger Honeywell HEPA air purifier where you can barely hear the lowest speed (it is labeled \"GERM\"). The lowest speed on this purifier sounds like the \"ALLERGEN\" speed on my bigger HEPA filter (\"TURBO\" being the loudest). If you like white noise or you don't care how loud it is, then this purifier is a very good choice, because it uses Honeywell filters which are widely available. But if you are looking to use it in an office setting, I would look for another one where only the higher speeds make noise.",

So far they do what I need them to do, and I run them 24/7 for the most part. Only turning off when we have windows open(after allergy seasonal height which is spring for us mostly).Don't forget to remove the plastic on top of the unit. It'll make it shinier and you won't have \"scratches\".",

                "reviewText": "Overall a decent air purifier. It is a bit louder than other models but I use it in my bedroom and I always sleep with white noise, so I don't mind at all. I do wish low was a little lower, as it's still moving a ton of air on low and that would probably help with the noise. In auto mode it is very fast to react to changing air conditions, much faster than the Shark models I have elsewhere in the house. All in all a pretty solid unit.",
