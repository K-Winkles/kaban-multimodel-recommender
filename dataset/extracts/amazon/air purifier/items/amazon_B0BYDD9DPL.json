I say surprisingly because it's so small, but I noticed a major difference in the smell of my room (had not been keeping up with the cleaning recently as I got sick recently) and I sneeze a lot less, right away once I started using it. So I know it's because of this purifier. I HIGHLY recommend it! Works perfectly and it's the perfect size!

                "reviewText": "It just stopped turning on soon after I purchased it due to the badly designed mini USB port that makes it too vunerable, because the USB cable sticks out too far when inserted. This creates a combonation of leverage, and weight on the USB cable that puts strain on the port and begins to wear it out everytime it is touched and even when it is just sitting there with constant preassure on the port. First it was intermitent, then it became fussy about the positioning of the mini USB cable in the port, then when I would put it down after changing the positioning, or if it was touched or bumped even a little, after putting it down, it would turn off. The return window closed right as it crapped out. Next time I will get one that has a proper attached electical cord and not a mini USB port. It does't work well on a device like this because even though I was gentle with it, the port is too sensitive. I have many devices with USB ports and have never had any problems, but the only way to make sure you don't have a problem is to avoid the USB port if it is not necessary. On something like this, you do not need USB and a regular attached cord is sturdy and more appropriate. This was a cheap way for the manufacturer to cut corners. UGH!",

This little thing is GREAT. It is not loud so he can have it running at night and what a difference with the cat hair in the room. Would recommend!!!",
