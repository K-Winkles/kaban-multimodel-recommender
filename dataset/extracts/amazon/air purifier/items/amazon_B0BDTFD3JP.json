It circulates the air in a 305 square feet room four times per hour or every 15 minutes. What is CADR? CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate. CADR helps tell you how much of a particular contaminant is removed from the air within a specific period of time. A high CADR means better air circulation. Why are air changes per hour (ACH) important when shopping for an air purifier? If you\u2019re not moving the air, you\u2019re not cleaning the air. Experts recommend at least 4 air changes per hour for optimal removal of airborne particles from the air. What kind of areas / rooms are best for AirDoctor 2000? AirDoctor 2000 is perfect for small living rooms, medium/small bedrooms, nurseries, home offices and more. How quiet is the AirDoctor 2000? On the highest fan speed, the AirDoctor 2000 has a sound level of 55 dB. On the lowest fan speed, it has a sound level of 40 dB.",

It takes care of any odors, reduces allergies/irritations, and makes a nice white noise sound to sleep to. I have it in my bedroom. You can turn on night mode which turns off all light indicators on it, so it doesn't bother you when trying to sleep. I can't sleep without it. I just leave it on auto-mode 24/7 in there. Haven't noticed any change to my electric bill because of it. I actually wound up buying the biggest one AirDoctor has (5000?) for our kitchen/living room (open concept). It completely gets rid of kitchen smells, which is great so our whole first floor (again open concept) doesn't get stinky from the food we cook. The big one is super quiet compared to this, barely makes any sound at all. Refrigerator is louder. But it is a lot bigger if you are comparing sizes to this one, which is more compact.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We\u2019ve had the air doctor for a few months now and it\u2019s great. The auto setting perfectly adjusts the mode/speed of the purifier based on the environment. We also have a cat who sheds a ton and this does a really good job of filtering out cat hair as well! We have had no issues with it so far and would recommend to anyone looking for a great low maintenance air purifier!!",

If I add cat litter to the litter box in the bathroom down the hall and around the corner from where it is, the filter senses it and it\u2019s on red right away, clearing the dust out of the air. If I spray Febreze or air freshener- sand thing. The filter senses it and goes on red until the air is clear. Really amazing. It definitely helps reduce dander and smells from the cats and dust too.",
