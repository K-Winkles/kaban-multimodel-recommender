I ultimately decided on this one, because of his great reviews..Overall I am very happy with this purchase, I find it\u2019s totally worth the price tag.. it does a terrific job at clearing up the cigarette smell.. before owning it the smell radiated the whole house, my kids were going to school smelling like it and All.I placed this purifier in the hallway outside of her room, and it has completely alleviated the problem.. It\u2019s also extremely quiet as well!The filter itself lasts quite some time, this machine has filtered out of very good amount of smoke over the past 3 weeks .. my mother smoke 5 packs a day, and The filter is still going strong . The replacement is very easy to find and also extremely easy to replace.. when the time does come. it\u2019s also helped tremendously with dust, this has been a problem in my older home for quite some time, I am considering purchasing another one for the first floor just for this problem.The colorful lights are an added bonus really cool and create a peaceful mood..This air purifier, is an amazing machine! Totally worth the price! Highly recommended",

Out of the box, this is made really well, good solid design, good motor and fan system, and one of the best air filters that I have ever seen where it has good thickness and at the same time, the motor can actually push air through it...where this is amazing in itself. The controls are touch sensitive and work flawlessly. The fan is super quiet, even on higher speeds. Love the variations of light, and the timer is a big plus too. No cons, can't think of a single one where I am very happy with the purchase.",

I love the lights. Are usually keep it on one instead of having the lights change. It\u2019s a great option to have for the ambience of the room .",

I have pets, dogs and cats! I also have asthma and allergies to just about everything!I usually get pretty congested in my lungs, and do a lot of coughing, plus do nebulizer breathing treatments often, but since this has been running and cleaning the air, I've felt that I'm breathing much better, and my cough is almost nonexistent. This is just in one day!Yes, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It's very easy to set up and use. Nice and quiet. If you put it on the sleep mode, you can't even hear it!I saw that it's still on sale, so purchased second one yesterday \ud83d\udc97",
