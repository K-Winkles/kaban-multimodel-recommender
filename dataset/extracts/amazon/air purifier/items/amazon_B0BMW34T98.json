                "reviewText": "Small but mighty. I bought 4 for my house. They aren\u2019t for huge rooms ( I got a bigger one for my living room ) . But these are great for my kitchen, bedrooms, sunroom. 3 speeds. I use it on the 2nd setting . option to light it up and it changes color. I can use it for a night light. Low speed at night and it\u2019s really quiet. Less dust, breathing better, sleeping better. No more sore throats when we wake up.. we just generally feel better. We haven\u2019t done anything else so I attribute some of the positive things to this little Beauty. Filters are easy to check and change too! I run the units constantly and my electric bill is hardly noticeably any different.All in all great unit.I bought 2 more for Christmas gifts for family family w/ asthma hoping it helps them too",
