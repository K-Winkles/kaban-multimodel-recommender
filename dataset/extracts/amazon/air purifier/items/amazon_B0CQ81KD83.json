I really like how easy it is to get to the filter. A plus with the Wi-Fi option but the touch screen menu on the product is simple to use, has many different options to choose from. With it being 2000 plus compatible that makes it worth the buy, I\u2019ve tried many others over the years but I really like all the thought with the design of this one. So far it\u2019s been really handy. I like to use at all times so I never honestly ever cut mine off, you know it\u2019s working when you are cooking or unwanted smells. Ultimately I believe I will grab another one for my basement. If your looking and searching I would recommend it for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I'm going to start with the stuff I don't like, so we can end this on a high note. The stuff I don't like is very minor. But it's why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5.I'm not a fan at all of how the filters are changed in this. Most air purifiers, whether they use a circular filter or a square one, have a hatch or door that you open, usually on the back, that facilitates filter removal and installation. With this one, you have to...hold on to the bottom with your feet, basically...and twist the entire top of. Which, of course, leads to having to precisely line up exactly where the 2 halves go back together. With marks that are difficult to see. This could have been done better. So make sure they have the physical capability to physically hold the base and remove the top, as well as have good enough vision to line up 2 difficult to see marks to put it back together. This is my only complaint about the air purifier.What do I like about it? Well, lots, actually. But I'd like to touch especially on what makes this a good unit. When I opened it up, I took a good look at what moves the air in this thing...specifically, the impeller. Most \"budget air cleaners\" will use generic squirrel-cage blowers or...shudder...simple fans. The impeller on this is more like something I would see in a racing turbo charger...or a centrifugal-compressor jet engine. As someone who's actually a certified jet engine mechanic, I kind of know a good impeller when I see one. I was impressed with the...frankly, very advanced design...of the impeller in this air cleaner, so much so that I made it a point to discuss it here. This...beautiful piece of artistic aerodynamic machinery...is obviously the center of why this air cleaner is, in fact, so wonderfully quiet, even at higher air flow rates. Of course, you're always going to have noise, because you're moving air. But comparitively speaking, this is a very quiet air cleaner, and it's due in no small part to one of the coolest looking impellers I've ever seen on an air cleaner.If you choose to buy this, I recommend opening it up, and really taking the time to take a good look at the impeller on this air cleaner. You'll see what I mean. It really is a very advanced piece of work, and is worth taking a moment to appreciate. I would say quite a bit of trigonometry went into its design.Everything else is pretty standard fare...it has an app, which I chose to ignore. I don't want my air cleaner sending me messages and I don't find the need to check on its progress. Just...sit there and filter the air. Shhh. Aesthetically, the outside is almost as attractive as the impeller on the inside, and it's a really attractive air cleaner.And, it arrived undamaged from shipping, and was fairly well packaged, with I'd say about 4 layers of thick cardboard between the air cleaner and the cruel, uncaring world of \"shipping\". Good job.In short, there's really only 1 thing I don't like. The way you have to change the filters. But, at least that gives you an excuse, nay, an opportunity, to study the beautifully designed impeller that makes this thing go. It's quiet, works very well, has great engineering behind it, and even has an app...for those of you so inclined. 4 stars, and a recommended buy.",

                "reviewText": "I am impressed with this (Crecolife) air purifier! I love the app connectivity via wifi and the real-time air quality assessment & display. Just to clarify, you don\u2019t have to use the app or mess with wifi connections to enjoy all of the features of this air purifier if you don\u2019t want to mess with it, it\u2019s just nice to be able to control the unit remotely.So, if you\u2019re like me and either didn\u2019t receive the instructions or simply lost them while unboxing the unit (likely the latter) you\u2019ll want to know how to enter pairing mode. Entering pairing mode is as easy as turning the unit on (be sure to open the unit to retrieve the power adapter and remove the plastic from the filter) and then holding your finger on the fan icon \u201cbutton\u201d on the top of the air purifier for about 3 seconds until it beeps. That\u2019s it, you are now in pairing mode. You\u2019ll do the rest of the setup in the \u201cTuya Smart\u201d app or the \u201cSmart Life\u201d app, as they\u2019re basically the same app. The rest of the setup is easy once you\u2019ve registered an account with the app. Just click the plus button at the top right of the home screen of the app once you\u2019ve entered pairing mode on the purifier as described above. It should find it fairly quickly and once it does, that\u2019s it other than optionally renaming the purifier to your preference.The purifiers auto mode seems to be the best mode for most cases as it adjusts the fan speed based on air quality. It is fairly quiet under normal operation but it does get relatively loud if you prefer to crank it up manually to \u201cturbo\u201d mode. While it is pretty loud, it also really moves some serious air volume on turbo too. It\u2019s also worth noting that if you\u2019re one of those people who needs some sort of white noise for sleep, this is great for that while on \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cturbo\u201d.I love this air purifier. It definitely works, and I was kind of skeptical if these things even do anything aside from wasting energy. I haven\u2019t sneezed, or had itchy eyes since about 15-20 minutes after it was turned on. I didn\u2019t think much more about it until I realized I wasn\u2019t miserable as usual. This realization probably took me 2 hours to figure out. I have 3 cats and a dog and the cats\u2019 fur and dander has really started to become a problem for me over the last two or so years but, being my fur-babies and all, I\u2019d never even consider not having them around. We\u2019re talking about a guy that moved out of a really nice apartment with the cheapest rent I\u2019d ever seen because the manager used to tease my dog (R.I.L Lorelei) and so naturally she hated him after a while and would growl and bark at (only) him. That idiot decided to say Lorelei was \u201cvicious\u201d, which was laughable to everyone who had the privilege of meeting her. \u2026ummm, where was I again? Oh! Yeah, that\u2019s right, the air purifier.The bottom line is that this \u201cCrecolife KJ402F Series\u201d air purifier is a serious winner! One of my favorite scores from Amazon, or anywhere else, to date. Needless to say, I absolutely recommend it!",
