                "reviewText": "11/17/2019 UPDATE: I've been using this air cleaner now long enough to give it a fair review. It works great. The air is noticeably cleaner. I have a large pet parrot and the feather dust is a challenge for any air cleaning device. It's doing a great job. Also, I contacted customer service about the light and they were very helpful. There's a video in the video section of the listing that shows you how to remove the LED lights. Also, customer service told me that they are upgrading this model to another one that has a light shut-off option. Even though it's too late for me, at least they are listening to customer feedback and making necessary changes where needed and wanted by customers. Overall, I'm happy with this unit. Thank you customer service for your help.It's hard to rate this honestly, because I've only been using it for a month.1. The noise level is good. It's alot quieter than previous air purifiers I've had.2. A big negative for me: The light is extremely bright BLUE AND YOU CAN'T SHUT IT OFF. Why would they make this machine with a light so bright that it says on all the time? I use this in my bedroom, so I had to shut it off for the night! Defeats the purpose.3. The instructions are hard to understand; poor English4. It doesn't look like it's going to be easy to change the filter when the time comes5. There was a weird smell that came from the machine when I first ran it, but it was gone within a day. It's fine now.6. I tooks like there's no way to disconnect the top and bottom of the machine to replace the filter. I read a review where the customer said that they tried to replace the filter (removing the bottom) and it fell apart. He also stated that when he contacted customer service, they never got back to him to help in any way.I wish I had read that before I bought this machine. I think I'm going to stick to getting things like this from stores. At least you can return them for a refund if the manufacturer won't respond to defects in their products.MY REMEDY FOR THE HORRID, GLARING BLUE LIGHT: Cloth electrical tape around the middle (tape I got from Amazon for another reason). When all is said and done, I don't expect much out of this machine. If it lasts 5 months, then I got my money's worth and it will go into the landfill where all other substandard products go.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this air purifier for the laundry room where we keep the cat's litter box. It works surprisingly well to control orders and keeps the air fresh. It's small and compact, quite running and easy to set up. The reason I gave it 4 stars was the USB plug with no charger block. It seems like this would have been an inexpensive addition. Also, make sure you order the correct size replacement filter. It uses H13 compatible with P40 air purifiers. We installed 7 weeks ago and plan to change every 3 months. So far, so good.",

                "reviewText": "First day review. Just to be safe, I selected it to arrive in Amazon packaging which helped protect the inner packaging. The unit arrived in perfect condition and was packed nicely. The purifier is the perfect size for my desktop and doesn't take up a lot of room. It's about the size of 2/3 of a 2 liter soda bottle. It's nicely made and attractive on the desk. Even on high speed and 3' away the fan is pretty quite and the white noise is soothing. I ran it all night long w/o using the timer. The night light was pretty cool too as seen in the photo.I'm not so sure it would purify an entire bedroom but I didn't buy it for that. Just for my immediate work area. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

If you don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s an allergic reaction causing my stomach and esophagus to get inflamed when I come in contact with things that I am allergic to. It could be something I eat or an inhale allergen. When this happens I can easily choke on food, have severe stomach cramps, and break out and severe eczema. Not fun.This little guy is easy to pack in my suitcase and even fits in my work backpack. So if I have to travel for work, I can still have an air purifier wherever I\u2019m working and even at the hotel. It works great is easy to use and I definitely have a lot less issues when I remember to take it.",
