I've had a mediumish size of purifier, and large size. This one has out classed them. It may be rated for a smaller room size then my others but I honestly think it could cover bit more than is listed. Within about 5-10 mins of being on in my room, there was a noticable difference in air quality.I don't any run purifiers 24/7, but it could be. They also have settings for how long you want it to run at a time, filter levels. I'll have to okay around more to refine my favorite settings. I bought it because I have anaphylactic allergies to weed, and bad reactions to a lot of scents/perfumes. I got it because live in California and sometimes some people smoke in the neighborhood I live in. this little powerhouse has already helped with that. I also have roomates and has helped keep my room safe from fragrances they use in their soaps or what not.Definitely recommend grabbing if you want a efficient little guy in your home. I got it on sale so was definitely worth the money. I'd say even off sale, since it owrks better then any of my past bigger and more expensive purifiers.",

We have one in our bedroom and one in the common area of the house. The white noise isn't too overwhelming, and the sleep mode is great! I do like that it tells you how much longer the filter is good for, based on usage.",

We live in Arizona and it's dusty outside ,inside ,everywhere. We purchased 2 of this product one for the master bedroom and the other for the main living area. This purifier helped clear dust and allergines from the air. In addition the box came with 1 replacement filter. The filters lastest longer then I thought and only needed relaced every 3-4 months. So I would recommend ordering 3 replacement filters for the year.",

                "reviewText": "This air purifier does an excellent job of cleaning the air in my bedroom. You know it's bad when you can see your air, and in a home with birds it is unavoidable. I decided to add a compact air purifier to every room in the house, and it made a noticeable improvement to my indoor air quality. I keep it on the low setting at night, and can barely hear it. Quiet, compact and effective. The only issue I have is that I am unable to find replacement filters at this time. I contacted the manufacturer and was told they would be made available by the end of November 2022. I would rate this unit 5 stars, if they provided a link for replacement filters, and will update my review accordingly.UPDATE:The manufacturer has posted a link for replacement HEPA air filers as promised, and sold them at a reasonable price, but I noticed the electronic fan speed controller was starting to fault and would reset itself to the highest fan speed after ten seconds after about three months.. I took the filter out, unplugged the unit, and it continued to adjust the power by itself until one day it just threw an error code and stopped working after 6 months. I got it to work once again, but you have to be quick on the controls.It's an inexpensive air purifier, and I have another one from another manufacturer that costs only $10 more, and it continues to work well, so the inexpensive price tag shouldn't be an excuse.The warranty is one year, and I did contact the seller, but got no response. I replaced this with a more reliable brand.",
