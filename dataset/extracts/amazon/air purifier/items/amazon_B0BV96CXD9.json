                "reviewText": "It took a perfect storm of events to make me spring for the Air Mini+. I\u2019m spending far too much time indoors. Concerns over CoVid19. Moldy odors in my living room. Allergies to bushes that grow outside my bedroom. Oh, and I\u2019ve got two big hairy GSD dogs that love to go in and out of the house bringing in all manner of dust. So I finally decided to buy this. It arrived in two days. It\u2019s very nicely packed in a specially fitted box with a beautiful one page set of directions on brown Kraft paper plus another booklet (that I didn\u2019t read) and it\u2019s own drawstring bag. Within a few minutes I had twisted off the top, taken out the plastic wrapped filter, put the filter back in, twisted the top back on and had it plugged in; it came right on. I downloaded the app, entered my wifi password and the app immediately recognized the device. Took maybe all of ten minutes tops from box opening to registering on the app. So does it work? Well I thought it would be weeks. I just had it running while I sat watching tv. It was like 3 feet away. Within 2 hours I could tell the air I was breathing in was so fresh and clean. Like wow! It works and super fast too. I think even my dogs liked it as they usually lay in different areas of the house but they both napped within 2 feet of it. The app and physical device design are both well thought out. For the app, I can easily turn it on, off, adjust fan level, or see if the particulate matter is good or bad. If you don\u2019t already have your phone in your hand, like when would that ever happen? You can also just touch the center of the grey circular part of the purifier to do this which is cool but is not intuitive (seriously, at first, I was looking for an on button to push, LOL). I guess I could\u2019ve read the directions. The handle/strap is a nifty way to take it from room to room. It doesn\u2019t weigh that much. I also like the ingenious cord wrap on the bottom so I can uncoil a longer length or recoil it to shorten to reach the outlet with a just right amount of cord. On auto-protect, the fan is a quiet white-noise level. I was watching tv and it did not impact my hearing of Voldemort\u2019s hissing whispers. If you turn the fan up to level 4 or 5 it does make more noise but why would I need that? Maybe for when I cook those campfire smoky meals. If you couldn\u2019t tell already, I\u2019m overall impressed and happy with this purchase.There are less expensive air purifiers out there but this is the only one I saw that killed viruses. Take that CoVid19. Everyone needs one of these.",

                "reviewText": "This VOC air filter includes a hepa filter which can also trap COVID. Needed a VOC filter because new apartment is full of particle board cabinets in kitchen, bathrooms, doors, door frames, laminate floors, baseboards-there\u2019s no real wood anywhere. The place is filled with toxic chemicals & I have autoimmune interstitial lung disease, so must protect my lungs as well as my body. VOCs off-gas for years. These gases contain formaldehyde, neurotoxic chemicals & carcinogens, ie: \u201clegal poison.\u201d I like the compactness of the unit, a neutral white. Attractive, lightweight, & easy for me, in a wheelchair, to move from room to room. Others complain of noise. I\u2019ve had other filters that were horribly noisy, in fact so noisy that I didn\u2019t want to use them. I don\u2019t find this filter to be noisy. The highest fan speed of course is more loud but I\u2019m sure people set their TV volume much louder. I\u2019ve not yet gone through the process of connecting it to my smart phone. If it\u2019s difficult, I\u2019ll get my computer saavy friend to do it for me. I bought 2, one for bedroom, one for kitchen/living \u00e1rea. I usually keep it on fan speed three, 24/7, because the apartment building is totally new-I\u2019m the 1st occupant in this apartment. The Molekule is a bit pricey, but remember, it\u2019s actually 2 filters-a VOC filter & a hepa filter.",

Haven't used my inhaler since I plugged it in! One negative.... For some reason, I can't get my phone to connect to it via WiFi. Not a deal breaker, but would be nice to have the app assist.EDIT: Had this thing for four months now and it no longer works. Changed the filter 3 times already. It turns on and runs like normal, but the air isn't being filtered. I'm back to waking up with a stuffy nose and asthma symptoms.Check their Better Business Bureau LONG list of complaints. I'm not even going to bother with trying to return it. Not worth the hassle or trouble everybody else has had with them. I'll just buy a better brand of air purifier.DO NOT waste your money on this junk!",

I was looking for one that would destroy mold particles in the air and purify the toxins from a new building space once we move. The first Molekule we received was broken. I had to call and troubleshoot and was super disappointed that something soooo expensive was broken upon arrival. I sent it back and got a replacement, and was very happy the new one worked! I\u2019ve had it for a week and can tell a difference in my room. My kids love keeping an eye on the color coded sensor for particles in the air and I can say that we are are breathing better. The only cons are what others have said: 1) the off gassing smells terrible for the first 24 hours and 2) the noise on level 4 and 5 really does sound like an airplane taking off! All other levels are good though. Oh and I love the look!!",
