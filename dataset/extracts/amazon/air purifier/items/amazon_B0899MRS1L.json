                "reviewText": "I approached the purchase of this air purifier with initial skepticism, given the plethora of alternatives from lesser-known brands boasting similar or even greater coverage at significantly lower prices. However, upon its arrival, my reservations were quickly dispelled by the unit's impressive design. It seamlessly integrates into any room aesthetic, becoming a stylish and welcomed addition to every corner of my apartment.What truly impressed me further were the noise levels, which proved to be nearly inaudible on two out of the three fan settings. This feature has undoubtedly contributed to a more peaceful and undisturbed living environment. Interestingly, I discovered that others have successfully incorporated this air purifier into their smart home setups using a smart plug. Nevertheless, I've personally opted to keep it on \"Auto\" mode, appreciating its real-time air quality monitoring and responsive adjustments.The impact on my living space has been tangible. I've noticed a marked improvement in both the air quality of my home and a reduction in my allergy symptoms since incorporating this air purifier into my daily routine. In essence, my initial skepticism has transformed into a genuine appreciation for the effectiveness and aesthetic appeal of this unit. It has undoubtedly proven to be a valuable investment in enhancing the overall atmosphere of my living space.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased the Coway Airmega 230 in dove white. I was looking for an air purifier that worked with a smart plug...meaning that when you cut power to it and power it back on, it \"remembers\" the settings and comes back on automatically. This one does...with one small caveat.When power is restored via the smart plug, the unit comes back on at the same fan speed as it was at when power was cut. However, the settings for the lights on the unit are not maintained. Meaning, if you have the lights turned off, when you turn the smart plug back on, all the lights will come back on. A small annoyance but overall happy with the fan speed being maintained. The video on this review shows this scenario.I was also looking for an air purifier without an ionizer - and this one does not have an ionizer (I confirmed with Coway support before ordering).Something else that I didn't realize before receiving the purifier was that the Sleep mode this unit has seems to use a combination of a light sensor as well as the particle sensor. Example - if the unit is on Smart mode and the room gets dark and the air particle sensor doesn't detect an increase in particles for a small amount of time, the until will automatically go into Sleep mode, which turns the fan down extremely low. When the lights come back on in the room, it automatically comes out of Sleep mode after a few minutes and goes to one of the other 1-3 fan modes. This was a nice feature for Smart mode that I didn't really see advertised / explained anywhere for this particular model (some of the other Coway models have a Sleep mode described like this which is how this model seems to function too).The only downside so far with this unit are the lights on the top - especially the air quality light. It is extremely bright and in a dark room it lights up the whole room. It's nice you can turn the lights off though with the button on the top (you can turn just the air quality light off or all lights (including the mode lights). Not so nice they come back on after toggling with my smart plug, but I will solve this minor annoyance with some white tape.Overall I am very happy with this air purifier - it works great, it looks great, and I have it integrated with Apple HomeKit via a smart plug. I have as \"smart\" of purifier as I need from a very trusted brand now.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two 230s and 2 150s, for a 1790 square foot home. Downstairs is hardwood flooring, upstairs is fully carpeted. I have one 230 unit for all of downstairs since the dust is already minimal on that floor. A 230 in the master bedroom as it's a bigger room and typically the bigger units run quieter. I put the 2 150s into the other bedrooms that my wife and I utilize as office spaces. Upon unpackaging and setting these up (which was a total breeze by the way, documentation provided is perfect), they immediately went to work cleaning the air. The air quality sensor is extremely sensitive and the color scheme is easy to understand and the LED is bright. We kept all of our units on auto initially, and they immediately go to work cleaning the air, LEDs changing color as the air gets cleaner, the unit also getting quieter until the light is blue and the unit is whisper quiet. If the air is clean for a while the unit goes into sleep mode to save power. But as soon as we cook or do anything that may disrupt the air quality the sensors detect it and kicks the unit into gear to clean up the air. We haven't had them long enough to notice if the levels of dust have been reduced, but we can already notice an improvement in the air quality. The air is fresher and there's way less smells left lingering, especially after cooking which we do a lot of. Bacon smell was gone after a couple of hours. Maintenance seems easy enough and the company has a good reputation for support and reliability so I'm hoping these units last a good while. So far very happy and would highly recommend these if you want to clean up your air and cut down on dust and smells.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Dyson HP09 in my bedroom that cost over $1000, and I use the Coway to clean the air in the rest of my apartment. My building uses a scented cleaning substance in the hallways and the smell drives me absolutely nuts + gives me headaches if I'm around it for too long. I am very sensitive to scented chemicals and perfumes and can catch the tiniest little whiff, but the Coway succeeds at removing all perceptible traces of the smell within my unit.While I recognize that part of the cost difference is in the fact that the Dyson it also heats / captures formaldehyde / has a fancy LED display, the fact that this little guy is less than a quarter of the price and outperforms it at cleaning air is pretty crazy. On its auto mode when the air is at steady state clean, it's also much quieter than the Dyson's equivalent auto mode.It processes odors and particulate matter much faster than the Dyson and seems to be way more sensitive - in a good way. I spray some cleaning fluid on the kitchen counter, it revs up. I heat up some food, it revs up. Someone who smokes walks into my place - it revs up. I open the apartment door for a second and let in a whiff of hallway air - it revs up. Smells never linger very long when this little guy is running, and the air quality in my unit has become noticeably fresher and cleaner. Headaches are gone.Definitely the best $250 I've spent in a long time. Sure, the Dyson looks a little cooler - but if you're after performance and value for money, the Coway Airmega 150 blows Dyson absolutely out of the water. What a wonderful little unit! So grateful that Coway made this. :)",
