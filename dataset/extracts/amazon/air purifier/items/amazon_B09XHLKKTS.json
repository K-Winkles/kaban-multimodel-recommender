As someone who suffers from allergies and asthma, having a clean and fresh indoor air environment is of utmost importance to me. This air purifier has truly made a noticeable difference in the air quality of my home.The design of the air purifier is sleek and modern, blending seamlessly with my home decor. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in any room without being obtrusive. It also pushes out as much air as my standard size house fan which was a pleasant surprise for its small size.Additionally, the air purifier boasts an activated carbon filter that tackles unpleasant odors such as cooking smells or cigarette smoke. This feature is especially beneficial for individuals with sensitivities to strong odors or those living in urban areas with high pollution levels.In terms of performance, I have found this air purifier to be exceptionally quiet even on higher fan speed settings. It operates silently throughout the night while I sleep without causing any disturbances or disruptions.The maintenance is hassle-free thanks to its intuitive filter replacement indicator. The filters are easily accessible and straightforward to replace, ensuring the device continues to function optimally.I highly recommend this purifier.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Air purifiers are niche products nowadays but you won't realize the advantage of having such a product in the home until you use it at your home and see the dirt being collected in the filters while doing regular cleaning of the product. I already have 2 bigger air purifiers in my home that clean our living area and bedroom respectively. Got this to use in our small office room since we tend to use that room regularly due to work from home. I have used it for the last 5 days now and here is my take. I would highly recommend this product. It is one of the fanciest small purifiers I have ever seen.My 2 cents below:Pros:- It does the job of an air purifier very well as we can feel the difference in the dust in the office room- Different levels of fan control : 3 levels + sleep. You won't hear anything when on speed1 or in night mode. Very silent- 3-layer filtration in this product air purification \u2013 \u0421apture smoke, dust, odors, and allergens- Very fancy looks and gives a great aesthetic to the home while in use. The dimmable ambient light looks very appealing and makes it premium in design- Timer functionality is nice to have with 3 settings (2h/4h/8h) available- Overall it is quiet, even at the highest fan speed. Refer to my attached video- Filter replace indicator is available too that lets you know when it is time to change the filter- Great build quality and feels very premium- Detailed manual with all steps and troubleshooting details- Manufacturer provides a 1-year warrantyCons:- I wish it had smart WiFi connectivity to control it remotely or at least a remote control was included- No real-time AQI (Air Quality Index) numbers are displayed to keep informed. Both of my other purifiers do show those and it is convenient to have a track on it. No auto mode in these purifiers, so I believe it misses the sensor that detects the air quality index",

I haven't used the aromatherapy pad yet but going to get some essential oils for that. The size is great, I have it on our bedroom dresser next to the TV and it fits well. It's not clunky or heavy at all. I have the power knob somewhat in the middle and the sound doesn't bother me at all. I also love the changing colors of the light and the ability to stop on one color. The filters look like they will get the job done and after having it on for a few already feel like the air is clearing. Purchased two of these so I can't wait to setup the second one.",

The allergies that make breathing difficult are made so much better with this unit.The timer is a great feature and easy to use. About an hour before I'm ready for bed I press the clock button until 8 hours is displayed. This cleans the air in the bedroom all night and turns off automatically in the morning to save electricity and filter life.There is a nighttime feature than turns the fan way down and the indicator lights off. I don't use this feature as I like the extra filtering, but it could be super helpful for a really light sleeper. The nightlight feature works and has three well designed brightness levels.The display and touch buttons are simple to understand and use. It is full of features and a great price. Highly recommended for small to medium rooms.Note: the internal filter comes sealed in plastic to keep it fresh for the purchaser. Removing the package that seals the filter is easy but has to be done for the unit to filter the air.",

                "reviewTitle": "Variable Speed Fan gives you clean air at 2 Watts, perfectly silent.",
                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research on small air purifiers for my Tiny Home, and this one really stands out head and shoulders above the rest. Here's why: Pros:\u2022 The fully adjustable fan speed knob is a huge improvement over 3 fan speeds. You can dial in \"silent\", \"white noise\", or whatever level of sound you need. This is crucial for me because I'm sensitive, and I sleep with it in the same room. I turn it up when I leave the house to circulate more air, and down when I'm sleeping to maintain air quality.\u2022 The directional nature of this is more useful to me than the general \"circular\" systems many units use. At night, I point this at my head, from ten feet away, on totally silent mode, to take the C02 I exhale away, and replace it with fresh, clean, oxygen-rich air. When I first turned it on, I noticed the difference immediately. It feels great. No stuffy nose.The directional feature also helps so you can place this just off a wall in the middle of the room, to fully circulate air around the room. Do the circular units really pick the air out of the room corners? Who knows? In summer, I can aim this at wherever I'm sitting, or lying, to cool myself with fresh air. I had some nice small fans before, but I got rid of them, because this is better. This is a fan with benefits.\u2022 The filter inputs area is twice the size of the output area. As an industrial designer, I appreciate this extremely intelligent design, because the HEPA filter slows air down, so other units where the input area is identical to the output area create friction through static pressure, which chews electrical energy, creates noise, and reduces flow. I can feel the air from this fan from ten feet away on the super low setting, but I can't hear it. Smart!\u2022 The filters are the standard modern blend of pre-filter, HEPA filter, and then carbon filter. Nothing revolutionary here. They are well made, but slightly on the expensive side. The company says you can vacuum the pre-filter to extend life, which is nice of them, but I clean mine by blowing them from the HEPA side out to the pre-filter side with compressed air, every few months, so they last virtually forever.\u2022 Using a 24V DC brushless motor is also very smart, so the energy use is as low as possible. I have a watt meter for testing. This unit draws 2 watts on low, 24 watts on high. I never run it on high, at most, I run it on low-medium, about 10 watts, which does my airtight 20' x 10' x10' Tiny Home just fine. The variable speed control produces zero, and I mean zero, \"electronic control whine\", like dimmers on LED bulbs etc., used to.I only wish there was a 12V adapter so I could run this directly off my batteries, instead of hopping my 12V electricity up to 120V in an inverter, and then plugging this in for the (included) adapter to drop back down to 24V, which is inefficient. But \"inefficient\" at 2 watts is no big deal. Literally 2.3 watts to make 2 watts. All the same, a 12V adapter option for the RV/Tiny Home market would be nice.\u2022 Small things: The filter area is easily accessible. The feet are perfectly soft but \"sticky\" so the unit stays where put, doesn't vibrate, and doesn't mark furniture. The unit looks nice, and doesn't take up space. I don't use the aromatherapy option, because I'm allergic to VOCs.A Note On Sizing: People wonder what size of unit to get. There is no real perfect system for rating CFM to room size. It depends on how fast you want to treat the air, traded off to how much noise you want to put up with. A bigger unit will allow you to run the fan on a slower speed, which is quieter, but moves the same air as a small unit on a high speed, which is noisier.My space is 200 square feet, is airtight, and this unit does me totally fine, and is virtually silent. I appreciate the small size, in my Tiny Home. If you are doing a room, or even a bigger room like a kitchen, this will do you fine. For a whole house, or a first floor of a house with 4 rooms, I would get something bigger. This company has this unit in 4 different sizes, which is smart.All in all, I love this fan. Perfect!",

It\u2019s cleaned the environment up inside a few days, the air is fresher and hay dust/smell of musk is removed. Very quiet for constant use, can kick it up quite a bit to filter hard while doing feeding chores then bring it back down for daily maintenance of the air. Arrived fast. Good price. Easy set up",

Additionally, the sleep function is extremely quiet but I like that I can turn it on high when I'm away. My apartment can get stuffy in the winter and I think this improves the air quality a bit.",
