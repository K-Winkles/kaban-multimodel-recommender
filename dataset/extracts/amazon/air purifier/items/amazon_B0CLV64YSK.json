                "reviewText": "This air purifier is really compact, smaller than I expected, but able to move a lot of air quickly. It is very easy to transport from room to room. It requires clear space on two sides to draw in air. I keep it turned sideways near a wall, which allows it to pull air from its front and back sides, which are now turned sideways to the wall. By drawing in from two sides, it keeps the filters clean twice as long, compared to a unit that pulls air in from one side only. My other purifier draws air from only one side, and the filter needs to be cleaned ever week. These filters can go for a couple weeks easily before I vacuum them, just to keep them at top performance. They are very easy to vacuum, taking only about a minute to do both. Features are pretty basic, with a simple timer and fan speed. There is an aromatherapy option, which is simple to use, but I have not tested.",

                "reviewText": "I want to preface this review by saying I've never owned an air purifier before and have nothing to compare it to. It's packaged securely and the instructions were clear. There really wasn't anything to set up or install because the filters are already inside. It turned on easily and the different settings work. I can't tell if it's actually doing anything or not though. I'm hopeful. I suppose I wouldn't be sure about any model I bought, but I have no reason to believe this isn't helping. Based on my research it would have been nice to include an extra filter or to have the screen on it that can tell you just how effective it is being. That being said I'm pretty happy to have it running in our bedroom because I'm hoping it might help with nighttime congestion. It can get pretty noisy depending on the setting you select, but it also mentions that. The sleep setting is low enough to not be an issue in our bedroom when trying to sleep.",

Is it an expensive placebo?I've had it in my nursery for awhile, near the dirty diaper wet bag. I don't think it's made it smell any better. True, I haven't put any oils in it, but I wanted to test the actual purifying powers, not just the strength of my essential oils to cover up the scent.Objectively, there are some neat features about this machine, like the dual air intake on the sides and the diffusing scent part on the exit. In the product description, there are easy instructions of how to order replacement filters.I guess even if I don't fully trust it, it makes an okay white noise machine and diffuser combination.",

I like that it can also be used as a sort of diffused. It came with extra pads for putting the essential oil on. I wish the air purifier had come with a couple extra filters instead of just the two that were already inside it. It would also be nice if there were a display of the current air quality so we know it's doing its job. Otherwise, great product!",
