                "reviewText": "I have had a Levoit EVOIT LV-H133-RF for a while and it has been great. It started making a noise and I think the bearings were wearing which can happen. Levoit customer service replaced the unit with a new one within 2-days. These highly efficient air purifiers and the large capacity filter drum, readily available on Amazon, has a 3-stage true HEPA Filter. It filters air free of 99.97% of pollutants as small as 0.3 \u00b5m such as dust mites, pet dander, and pollen trapping dust and micro particles and passes air through a final carbon filter. One of these towers works in a room up to 83m\u00b2 which great for a large room. The best thing about this is it uses a small internal detector to monitor air quality and will adjust itself automatically to clean the air. I use mine in the bedroom on low speed and it is silent. Even on high speed the fan is quiet, I have a second Levoit in the living room and a Levoit automatic humidifier. I recommend Levoit for excellent quality products and the best customer service there is which is why I only buy from them. Cannot fault them.",
