                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Serious piece of equipment",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace a low-energy, non-intrusive Shaper Image Ionic Breeze that had finally failed. Although there is an easy argument to be made that ionization of oxygen (O3 - Ozone) is a pollutant, for indoor smokers it is often the lesser of two evils. Ozone is tremendously effective at attaching to smoke particles and neutralizing. It is not a scented cover-up, but an actual neutralization, and it works great. As you may know, lawsuits against The Shaper Image's claims that the Ionic Breeze was an \"air purifier\" drove The Sharper Image to insolvency. So I needed a new solution, and I am fully aware of the harmful effects of ozone, and I, as a consenting and informed adult, accept the risk.The Ivation is indeed a hardcore ozone generator. It is FAR more serious than even the largest of the Ionic Breeze-style machines. There are two controls on it. The first is the ionization level, and the second is the fan speed. As an example, if I cordon off several rooms in my house and run this little box on high-ozone and high-fan, it will effectively load those three rooms, about 500 square feet, full of a high concentration of ozone in about 8 hours or less. How high? High enough that you will need to move rapidly through the rooms to open windows and extricate yourself from that environment. If you take too long, and need to take a gulp of air, beware. You'll be sucking down what smells and tastes like chlorine bleach. That is ozone. Depending on your tolerance, you may be able to take it, or you may feel nauseous. It is that strong.That strength is a good thing. Remember, you have the capability to dial-down the ozone generation. So if it is too strong, dial it down to a lower level. If you are an indoor smoker, this will definitely go a long way towards removing that stale, cigarette smell. Almost no one can tell that I smoked indoors throughout the winter, with closed windows.This is NOT the type of air purifier I would use if there are people in the room. It is an after-action clean-up type of purifier. Use a HEPA air filter when you are in the room. It's loud, but there are no noxious, ozone gas to deal with.Be aware that ozone can damage all sorts of things. That free oxygen atom wants to bind; it is a chemistry fact. It will not only bind with other pollutants, but also your books, artwork, silverware, et al. For this same reason, never run this the same time you are running a charcoal prefilter on another air filter. You'll waste that charcoal filter in no time. Charcoal loves to bind - ozone loves to bind - the ozone will quickly render your charcoal prefilter entirely used. Know your risks. Be aware.All that said, I am highly satisfied with my purchase. That I can smoke inside, and the place has a sterile, clean smell, is rather incredible. I would recommend you understand exactly what this machine is good for, and make sure it meets your needs. For most people, this may not be the right match. But for those that it is, you're probably going to love it.",

                "reviewText": "I should say first that I've had trouble with ozone generators in the past.The first was my own error. I once had an ozone generator (OG) which had been given to me by my father. I liked how it got rid of smells and seemed to freshen the air. So I ran it at full intensity while working in my home office, with the door closed. I'd heard that ozone breaks down into oxygen and thought, for some vague reason, that this meant it would be fine to breathe it. (Not smart, I know.) This was decades ago, before it was widely known that ozone can be problematic. But I still should have done more research before using it without ventilation.After several weeks of doing this, I found abruptly that I couldn't breathe... could not get air into my lungs. I ended up taking a trip by ambulance to the local hospital. They gave me oxygen and I recovered.Based on this (expensive) experience I learned that it really, truly is good to NOT breathe ozone. You might be able to breathe a small amount in without a problem, or think there's not a problem, but if can be dangerous, so it's best to avoid breathing it in, especially in a concentrated dose.Five years ago, I bought a new ozone generator from Amazon. I'd learned by then not to breathe the ozone, but missed the air purifying qualities of the OG I'd owned. I planned to run it when I wasn't home.But the one I bought was terrible. The \"ozone\" or whatever it was producing smelled like burning plastic. It reeked, and made everything in the room I had tested it with also reek. I actually had to throw a bunch of clothes away, because they stunk so badly. Ozone does have a sharp, acrid smell but it shouldn't smell like toxic waste. Whatever that OG was producing was not pure ozone. I returned it to Amazon.A few months ago, I bought this one.And... it's great. Unlike the weird one I bought five years ago, this one makes real ozone. I recognize the smell.But of course, I don't breathe it. Instead, I put it on sometimes when I'm leaving the house, using a timer so it'll shut off production of ozone an hour before I get back. And I leave a ceiling fan going. That gives the ozone time to dissipate and degrade into oxygen. The house smells fresh and clean, all odors gone, when I get home. I don't know if ozone kills all viruses; I suspect it may; but I know it kills some, and using one (when not home) is a good way to clear them out of the air.The other feature this one has, besides a highly effective ozone generator, is a very potent ionizer. It's on a separate control, so you can use it on its own. As far as I know, it ONLY generated ions, not ozone, when you use that knob. I do use this feature when I'm home, because I'm in wildfire-smoke-country and it helps clean the smoke out of the air. (I also have a Winix air purifier that I usually have going at the same time. Together, they totally clear out the smoke.One funny note: when the Winix is on auto, if I turn on the ionizer on the ozone generator, the Winix detects the ions in the air and comes screeching on to try to get rid of them. So I run them in opposite sides of the house.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Late December 2022. Product seem to work fine at first. Made house smell good and clean. But then......in March, 3 months later I discovered that it was emitting a Black soot. It did significant damage before I realized it. You could not smell it. It didnt smell bad. I am NOT a dirty person. All my walls was washed in November for the holidays, we do not smoke nor do we have any wood burninf stove of any sort. No fireplace! So all this Black you see is from This Air purifier . Apparently it has black carbon it uses to clean or purify. Whatever the case may be. This caused Black soot to be all over in several rooms. This soot was nearly impossible to get off walls and decorations etc. So disappointed. I reached out to the company and they wouldn't respond to me. I made 2 attempts.I spent 8 hours washing and scrubbing walls, to no avail. It was like trying to get cement off a wall. I will have to have several rooms repainted.Do NOT BUY!! If I could give it negative stars I would. And FYI, I never leave reviews. I just wanted everyone to beware so you don't have thousands to shell out from Damages it will cause! Buyer beware!!",
