                "reviewText": "For placement purposes, the cord is about 7' long, which will make its way to most locations desired. It's a quiet unit, though I like white noise and prefer the higher speeds. It's super easy to set up and operate, just remove the bag from the filter it ships with and replace the filter, done. There is no remote control, but it does have some features for a timer, and the display can be completely shut off so the blue hue doesn't disturb you. Otherwise, it acts as a low-level night light and I do not find it disruptive.Overall, this unit works well. If you remove the filter cover while it is running, it powers off for safety. This is good for anyone with \"little fingers\" that may come along.",

It is efficient and easy to operate. It has a nice display so it is easy to read the air quality level. You can also set the purifier to automatic so it is effortless to maintain good air quality. It is rated for around 1,000 sq ft which is surprising given its smaller stature. I use it in my home office where my three dogs always stay nearby me when I am working and I like knowing that is working on controlling the doggy particles/dander that gather specifically in that room. It is a good value and the product performance is very good.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was shocked at how easy this is to put together. Basically, it already came put together with the small exception that you must remove the HEPA filter and remove the plastic bag that it comes in and then snap it back into the filter and power up. It is so quiet I barely noticed that it\u2019s running, it has several different settings including an auto settings. What I like about that auto setting is sometimes we don\u2019t know if an area in our home is not the best air quality. This makes it simple it does it for you and much to my surprise, parts of my home did not have the cleanest air, and then the setting allows itself to filter at the highest Possible filter setting, and will auto adjust itself as the air gets cleaner. I\u2019ve never owned a personal air purifier, but this is probably my new favorite thing as far as HomeGoods. It\u2019s also very quiet you can\u2019t hear it and at night if you like white noise, you can also turn it on a medium setting, and it will provide great white noise for a cleaner and more Comfortable sleep",
