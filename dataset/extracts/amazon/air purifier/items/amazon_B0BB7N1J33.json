                "reviewText": "Totally my fault for not realizing that this needed replacement filters and they were not reusable filters. I do think that this works great, just not for the space that it claims to be good for. I used it in my 12X12 room and it worked great there, but in my living room which is around 24X36, it didn\u2019t work well at all. It isn\u2019t loud at all and you can put scented oil in to help blow smell around, but it is a little difficult to clean out the spot for oil and it only came with one oil cushion so if your oils do not match, you will get a strange smell from the diffuser part. It is a great concept, but I wouldn\u2019t buy this again unless it came with a reusable filter that you can clean and if there were several cushions for oil or another way to deliver the oil. If these issues don\u2019t bother or worry you, then this is a great buy. It really does pick up dust and grime. I would just rather get one more economically friendly and that didn't cause more plastic in our landfills.",

It is a compact purifier that comes with even advanced features at its price point, offering more powerful output than some larger models. The automatic features work smoothly, and you have plenty of options to adjust them to your liking. Includes the carbon filter, which is super helpful for odors and pet dander. Goes in our room, and I've noticed better sleep after having turned this on as well.",
