                "reviewText": "This air purifier is not that small it's pretty decent in size for a desk or nightstand. The filter is a good size it could be used in a small living room if put on high. The low setting is whisper quiet the light is a good feature does not disturb me while I sleep. This is not a novelty by far but it is a very good air filter that will suck air and filter it. I'm currently using it in the kitchen counter which is very great. Just an ordinary person looking for it air purification because I moved into a house and kept sneezing in. I ordered two big ones from other companies for my living room and bedroom just because I tend to overdo it but I really want this air to be sucked through these filters through all means necessary. But I began to think all I needed was the small one because it's pretty efficient.. lol. So far since I've had it in less than 24 hours I stopped sneezing nearly completely but as I left the room that the air filter was not in I sneezed once almost immediately.. crazy it must be working but I really do feel both my nostrils cleared and able to breathe a lot better.. like I said this small one will surprise you definitely! I live in Florida by the lake there's a lot of pollen covered on our cars and I keep my screen door open so this is going to help if you have those issues. Sorry I do not have any videos or pictures.. the video would be boring... I seen two videos on this it's just self-explanatory. Definitely get this if you're on a budget..",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. UPDATED - After about a month there was an awful ticking noise. I contacted MegaWise, chatted with the customer specialist. They walked me through a few ideas on what could be making the noise and how to possibly fix it. After several tries and the noise is still there. They are sending me a replacement unit. It is very refreshing to have a company stand behind it's product !!! We live in a small mobile home, 600 sq ft, have pets, cook a lot and smoke. I hate coming home from work and the house smells of whatever was cooking that day and stale smoke. We had an air purifier that worked awesome, but now it's discontinued. The previous lite up so it was like a night light when you walked into the living room, that was a big factor for me getting this one. I keep it on low most of the time, however when we are both leaving the house I will put the fan on high, and I noticed the difference just after a couple days of it being set up. I am hoping it stays this way and doesn't weaken with age.",
