                "reviewText": "I bought a few of these to put in our bedrooms when covid hit our household since our other air purifiers are very large and noisy so they sit in the hall/living room. I liked them so much I bought 2 more to replace the old ones as well.They are so quiet on the lower settings that I often put my hand over it to make sure it's still on. The lights are pretty bright, but if you hold the power button a few seconds they turn off. The highest setting is a lot louder, but it's also a nice volume for some white noise while sleeping.Since they are so small and quiet I was not sure they actually work or move as much air as they say they do, but when I'm in bed about 10 feet away I can feel a little breeze, which I don't get from our other ones that are about half the capacity.",

                "reviewText": "We live in an older house and it has always had a certain smell to it. On top of that we have two bigger dogs and a cat. So needless to say we have all kinds of smells going on. I use to walk in the house after work and get knocked over by the smells. I was so self conscious about having guests over. I shopped around for a while for an air purifier. I wasn\u2019t prepared to spend a lot of money on one, although I knew I would probably have to get a good one. But then I found this one. Read all the reviews, price was fantastic and I was excited. Shipping was quick. I loved how easy it was to set up and it\u2019s quite even on high. The timer is an added benefit. After a few days of having it running, the smells were gone!!! I come home from work and can\u2019t smell the old house, or animals. I would highly recommend this. Also the filters are super easy to change and inexpensive. Great air purifier all around.",

                "reviewText": "I read the reviews and was eager to figure out the light situation. Other than the lights, this little guy got rave reviews PLUS it\u2019s marked down to his pennies with all the coupons on Black Friday/prime day. I figured out you have to hold down the power button on top for a solid 5-6 seconds or more to turn the top blue light off without turning the whole machine off. Problem 1 solved.Problem 2: the lights on the front. I loved this machine plus the little white ones are nice looking, sleek\u2026and I\u2019m fine with the lights because I sleep with an eye mask at night, my special needs son\u2026not so easily persuaded. I configured 2 thin elastics (used in sewing), both tied in a bow around the circumference. Then attached a black thick ribbon (my choice of pirate theme) and hot glued it to the part of the elastic that goes over the blue light section. Basically a little purifier G-string. It\u2019s moveable to access the controls if needed and holds tight against the light. Works great! I attached pictures for ideas to work off of but NOW\u2026this machine is perfect!I would have given the machine a 5 \u2b50\ufe0f BUT the front buttons for a machine that should also be able to be run at night should have the option to turn off. Anyway\u2026.Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "I live in a retirement community. My apartment is close to the kitchen and dining room, and unwelcome cooking odors often permeate my space. The Mooka has handled the odors perfectly. I turn it on only when I detect the cooking odors starting and turn it off in the evening. It keeps my apartment odor free. I usually keep it on the medium setting, and I don\u2019t hear it running. On high it has just a slight hum, but you have to be up close to hear it. I like the blue light because it reminds me to turn it off at night so I\u2019m not running it unnecessarily. It\u2019s a great little unit and well worth the money.",
