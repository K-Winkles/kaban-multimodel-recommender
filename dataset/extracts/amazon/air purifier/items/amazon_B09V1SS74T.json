The best thing about it is the display showing the percentage of clean air within the room. And also the filter life being much longer than so many cheap models, which end up not being cheap from changing filters so often.",

I decided to try this Shark Air Filter, after I saw an Ad for it on tv and after watching a couple of YouTube video reviews on it. I\u2019m glad now that I choose this one. We purchased it to help with dust, pet dander and mainly to help us with our allergies in our 36ft RV. So far it has worked flawlessly. I love how you can choose an auto mode where it automatically adjust to what it senses is needed to clean the air. I also like how it has a visible readout screen on the front so you can keep and eye out on the air quality, especially when it changes colors. I had cooked some battered shrimp on the second night we had it in our air fryer and honestly, within 30 mins, you could no longer smell the shrimp in our RV. That really impressed me. Overall I would highly recommend. It is a little pricey but well worth the money. I also like that it tells you the percentage of the air filter, so you know when it needs to be changed. Great air filter so far!",

                "reviewText": "The sensor only ever seems to read as less than \"100% clean air\" when there's smoke, like if we burn something on the stove. If run in Auto mode, that's the only time it will kick on.It seems incapable of detecting ordinary everyday dust. It will claim the air is 100% clean (and, if left in Auto Mode, basically shut itself off) even where there are dust particles visible in the air (as revealed by, for example, a bright flashlight beam).If you want it to actually suck dust out of the air most of the time, you'll need to run it in manual mode at Max or 3/4 power. Auto mode can't be trusted to actually filter out dust.It still gets 4 stars because as long as you run it in manual mode and don't trust the sensor there's nothing wrong with it. It does run more or less silently at 3/4 power or below, and at Max it is still reasonably quiet.",

                "reviewText": "I had an air purifier back in the day but questioned if it worked. It's one of those basic bedroom table one with a dial to remind me to change the filter. Haven't looked back until recently, when there were more dust accumulating on my tables, desktop, laptops, and even my phone despite only being a day.Looked around Amazon and found Shark's Air Purifier HP102. Had to review each air purifier before deciding which one fits my budget. Upon receiving mine, I left it on for 48 hours on auto, and I immediately notice a difference in air quality. It's much lighter and I can actually breathe without having to use a tissue. My dry eyes symptom also reduced significantly.I would upgrade to the larger one for 1200 square feet, but since I'm mostly upstairs in my office doing work, 500 square feet is more than sufficient. The air quality indicator gives a nice touch in my air quality in real time. The lowest it ever gotten was 83% today due to cooking downstairs in the kitchen in a 2400 square feet home.This would not work if dust already settled on the ground. A vacuum will be needed to remove that. To confirm that dust is removed, I did the sun shine test, where opening the curtains will reveal dust particles flying in the air. Noted that some may be from the curtain itself, which is no problem washing it.",

It is a compact unit, easy to put in a room, and not taking up much of a footprint- which I love. Shark products seem to be of high quality-I have several small appliances- and the prices are reasonable. Filter replacements are readily available at a nominal price.",
