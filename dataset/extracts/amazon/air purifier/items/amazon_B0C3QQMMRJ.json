Just grab it from the top and rotate off the bottom to remove the plastic and simply reinsert the filter and plug it in. I have it running continuously on the sleep mode, and it is very quiet.I have a bunch of allergies and need to take Loratadine every day, but I do think this is effective. I'll update back later.Anyways, there are multiple settings that you cycle through with a press of button, and you can control it with your phone (it must be a on a 2.4 ghz band, so 5G will not work. This isn't really an issue if you are not far from your router). I'd say it's a great product for its cost but do note that light for its specified setting is always on, but it is very weak, so you won't really be bothered by it even if you were trying to sleep. I have it raised up since it is more effective that way. To reiterate though, it should only be used in a small room.",

I definitely recommend this product for your small room! My only complaint is that it's on the 2.4ghz WiFi and most people have 5ghz so this means that I couldn't connect via WiFi, which ultimatelyMeans that I can not control it or get updates while I'm not home.",
