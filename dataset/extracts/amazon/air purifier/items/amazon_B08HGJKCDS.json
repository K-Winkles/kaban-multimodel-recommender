                "reviewText": "This is definitely the best air purifier I\u2019ve owned. I previously owned a Germ Guardian AC4300WPT that had significant shortcomings. The Purezone Elite does everything the Germ Guardian couldn\u2019t do.First off, airflow! The Purezone directs air in a forward motion enough so it doesn\u2019t immediately recycle the exhaust.Next, functional UV-C. It\u2019s clear that there is a long UV (replaceable!) tube light that gets exposed to the air the whole length of the air intake.Then the air quality sensor! I\u2019m impressed it's working and not a gimmick. Whenever I cook and something gets a little burned, the air-quality sensor reports poor air quality (as it should!). Paired with the auto mode, the unit becomes efficient and quiet, doing heavy work only when it needs to.Finally, the ionizer. After I finish cooking and eating, I like to go out. When I return, I\u2019m always amazed by how my apartment smells like the inside of a brand new water bottle! Clean and sanitized!There are also some fantastic QoL features I appreciate, like the night mode that turns off the lights. There\u2019s the HEPA *and* PRE replacement light indicators. The design of this unit is exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for; something modern, sleek, and clean looking.",

                "reviewText": "First, let me say that this Air Purifier is probably the best purchase I have ever made for my home. It was hard to decide on which brand to buy because there are so many. But these in particular had incredible reviews & since I rely heavily on intuition which was screaming that this was the one...I made the decision. They arrived quickly, packaged well, easy to set up, easy to use, easy instructions. But most of all, they worked! I'm pretty sure within 2 days of setting them up (I bought 2), I walked into my house and immediately asked my husband \"why does it smell so clean in here?\". Not that my house \"smelled bad\" but an occasional cigarette would be smoked if we had company, we would turn the air up before going to work so when we came home at the end of long days it would take a while for the house to cool down and it to smell lived in again (we live in Florida!), and it's been about 8 years since we've put a fresh coat of paint on the walls of our living room. Not to mention my husband eats seafood and that is a smell that I just can't tolerate. I literally have to go to another room until he's done eating, and then the vent fan above the stove had to stay on for about 2 more hours, and it is so loud! Plus I have a strong sense of smell and when he cooks any stinky foods like brussel sprouts, hard boiled eggs, cabbage.....I just don't like when my house smells like that. I was spending, and this is not an exaggeration, $60-$80 per week in candles. I would buy the large 3-wick and light 2 at a time and as soon as they'd burn out I'd light the next two.Long story short I have been so happy with these machines! They aren't big and bulky but actually slender & modern looking. They can fit in a discreet corner or they're good looking enough to keep out in the open. My house smells so clean, even 5 minutes after someone smoked a cigarette. It has cut down on dust and I no longer spend crazy amounts of money on candles, but have one little scented oil burner on a little table on the order side of the room. I had Chinese food delivered last week and when I opened the door the delivery person took a big whiff and told me my house smelled beautiful. Such a nice compliment.They come with a 5 year warranty, and though this was another factor in purchasing these machines, you never really know what is gonna cover. Well, after more than a year of use, the clean air indicator light stopped working on one and the other started to sound a little louder to me. I contacted the company using the details from the Amazon store where I made the purchase, they emailed me back within 48 hours asking me for the purchase address and the purchase details from Amazon, which was all easy to retrieve because it's in my order history, and a 5 second video of each one...LITERALLY, 5 SECONDS! The day after sending them this information I got an email that 2 new machines were already on their way to me... and I didn't need to return the old ones first for that to happen! Honestly, I can't think of a time EVER that having an electronic replaced was so easy! Their customer support is TOP NOTCH! I was helped by a very nice woman named Abby, and from the first time I made contact I felt like a priority!If you're thinking of purchasing an Air Purifier(s) for your home.... there really is just no better brand to buy! Money well spent & a level of customer assistance & standing by a product that just doesn't exist anymore.Thank you so much Abby and Pure Enrichment for making life so much easier for me! And I absolutely love your product!",

                "reviewText": "Recently my eight year old air cleaner stopped working. So I when decided to look for a replacement I looked at several brands. Since I had recently purchased a Pure Humidifier and liked it a lot since it didn't make any mess, was silent and worked great I decided to look at their air cleaner which I had remembered from seeing on their product page when I registered my humidifier. In most regards, the Pure air cleaner was identical to my old one in all important aspects: HEPA filter, charcoal filter, dust filter, catalytic filter and UV light. Pure added an ion generator, greater CFM air flow and Energy star Rating for about 60 percent of the cost of my old air cleaner and added a Five-year warranty. The replacement filters are a lot less expensive as well and easier to change. All in all, made it an easy decision to switch. Controls are simple and easy to use. Just like my old one, has an auto-mode plus a timer mode for people who don't want to run it all the time. Just like my humidifier, very quiet. Hard to go wrong with this choice if you are looking for an air cleaner. I didn't even mention that it looks a lot better than my old one which was the size of R2D2 from Star Wars, lol. I had submitted this review before but they posted it under the filter I purchased at the same time. By the way, sleep mode turns off all the lights on the machine but one very tiny pinhole light on the top for those that are bothered by lights at night.",
