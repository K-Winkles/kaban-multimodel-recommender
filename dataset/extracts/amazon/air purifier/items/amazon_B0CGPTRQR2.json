                "reviewText": "I have 2 cats and 1 dog, so the hair is crazy in my apartment. I wanted something that could help with the situation. I searched for an air purifier on Amazon. After scrolling down several pages, I decided to purchase this one because it is a new product and has a modern minimalist design. Also, I like the size and its price. Even though I was a little hesitant since I usually go for products with the most reviews, I thought about what I really wanted \u2013 a new product that is affordable and compact because my apartment is small.It is really compact, so it fits my apartment well. After using it for about two weeks, I feel a great improvement in air quality. Definitely a good buy.",

Current impressions: loving the sleek and simple design, it's easy on the eyes. What really surprised me is how quietly it operates in modes 1, 2, and sleep mode \u2013 seriously impressive. The powerful airflow definitely adds to its charm, making sure the air stays refreshingly clean. So far, so good! Excited to see how it holds up in the long run.",

So it\u2019s perfect for me when I sleep. And I can also turn on and off the night light function which is very helpful too. Level 3 and 4 are very powerful, so a bit more noise is understandable. The air in my bedroom has been significantly better since using this machine! High recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my bedrooms nursery nook, and it does look just as it does in the product images. I have two long hair chihuahuas who shed like crazy, so my hopes were that this could help cut down on any that was flying through the air along with any dust. It does a fantastic job filtering dust but there wasn\u2019t a lot of pet hair collected (it may just be too long to suction). I\u2019ve attached some photos of the filter after a few days of use, and one with it lit up in the dark. It\u2019s very quiet when on the lower fan settings, but if you intend to use it at max you\u2019ll hear it - though to me it sounds like white noise and isn\u2019t much of a bother. The design is sleek and modern, would have loved it in black, but I\u2019m quite happy with it thus far. The filter is underneath the bottom compartment and is easy to access for filter changes. I haven\u2019t needed to change it as of yet, but it says the purifier will glow red when it\u2019s due for changing which is nifty. I also really appreciated that they included a specific search key phrase for when the filter needs a replacement! Pasting it here in case someone needs it. Search for B0CH7VVB1J to find Airspark replacement filter for AS200 / AS300",
