It arrived in good shape and was extremely easy to assemble. It is light, easy to maneuver, and has a small footprint. Very versatile in terms of where you could put it. Just follow the provided directions to be sure you have the filters in the proper sequence. We ran the unit nonstop for 2 weeks. When I opened the unit to clean the pre-filter it had a noticeable amount of dust on it. So it was doing its job and seemed to help my friend's allergies. When it gets to be wildfire season I'm going to be especially glad to have this. I would strongly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I have used air purifiers for many years living in Los Angeles (City of) where dirty air is an issue. I have many allergies and can suffer from the occasional bout of asthma/bronchial asthma, so an air purifier is a necessity. I bought this after reading many reviews, because the one I have is many years old and I though with newer technology an upgrade was needed. I love this product! It is whisper quiet, nice to look at and you forget it is there. I turned it on and within 2 hours could feel the difference in air quality. Very user friendly to set up and use.I did purchase replacement filters with the unit, since reviews said they can be difficult to find sometimes. And great price for this product. I've paid a lot more for others. I've only used the 2nd level clean once to clear the odor of paint, worked like a charm. I highly recommend.I use in a space of about 425 - 550 sq feet.",

Something about the air feels crisp now.The only issue I have is the filter needs to be replaced. Although one can be washed, it\u2019s a series of a few filters and the one that prevents mold needed to be replaced. I thought it all could be washed.The filters are not easy to find either and costly. I needed to replace mine after 2 months, but it may be because I had water issue.In the end, I think it is worth it.",
