Like the older ones, it's a bit on the noisy side, but it does a great job removing dust and allergens from the air. I have quieter purifiers and while they have similar performance in terms of odor elimination (via activated carbon filters, which is an optional accessory for this Honeywell product) they simply can't match the dust/pollen/etc. reduction of this unit. Sure it's a bit louder, especially at higher speeds, but it's also more effective at those speeds than those other ones are capable of.",

                "reviewText": "I had the previous model, the HPA 100, for my daughter's bedroom and it worked out really well. I went with Honeywell because it seemed to have good features without creating ozone which was important for me. I decided that I wanted to get one for our bedroom too. Lo and behold there was a new version available. The new version is a little slicker looking, though, the clear plastic portion looks a little cheesy / will probably be prone to scratches. It is also a bit more efficient. However, the older model actually may cost less money to run because it uses less electricity / is smaller. This is also a bit bulkier than the old version, though the trade-off is it does purify more air. The real sticking point, though, was the low-level hum that this unit and the bigger models emited. It seems that the actual fan noise might be a little bit lower, and maybe I am just not used to this particular frequency of noise, but I just couldn't get over it. I also tested the noise volume between the new model and old model with a DB app and it did confirm that the new model was about 5 dB louder. This is in no way a scientific comparison, but it confirmed my anecdotal feelings about it. I have lots of fans, and music products, and none of them emit a hum like this. I usually associate a hum like this with some sort of grounding issue. Ultimately, I was disappointed and I returned it.",

                "reviewText": "My other 2 work fine but I decided to add a third to use in another room. They work great, they all use the same filters, easy to use, etc. Like others have mentioned it does show auto in the picture but this model didn\u2019t come with it. Not a huge deal as my old ones don\u2019t have that but it would have been a nice feature to try. Also the older ones have handles on the side so you can easily pick them up, this one doesn\u2019t have handles. I was tempted to give it 4 stars but for the price it performs well and I am happy with it.",

It is quiet and also really pretty, this version has a clear backing that lights up for the mode it\u2019s in. Don\u2019t worry, you can dim it! Highly recommend this brand of purifiers, it\u2019s the best bang for your buck!",
