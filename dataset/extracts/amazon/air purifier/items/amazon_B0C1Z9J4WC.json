                "reviewText": "I have this in my living room which has vaulted ceilings and stairs going down to the door, so there's alot of Sq ft to cover. I also have an air quality monitor. When the monitor shows that the air quality is going down, I turn this air purifier up and it brings it back to a healthy level. We also have a bunny who loves his dusty hay. On level 2 or 3 it makes some noise like a small fan, but I like white noise, so I'm good with it.",
