                "reviewText": "Update: my dog peed in my carpet. Two days after using this purifier, the terrible odor was gone. See as how I tried everything for a week before this and the odor would not go away, I like to think it was indeed this purifier that did it.----I ordered this because I already have one that emits ozone for odor control, which I use only sparingly because of the ozone. I'm not sure how this Coway purifier really does handle pet and food odors, but the product information says it does and the filter gets dirty when I run it, so I know it's doing something :)The timer is great (1hr, 2hr, 4hr, or 8hr). The night light is awesome. You can turn all lights off. If you're not using this on high speed, the purifier is very, very quiet. The control panel on this purifier is very simple to use and you do not even have to read the manual to know how to operate it.THE FIRST thing you want to do when ordering these purifiers that are manufactured and sold outside of America is to make sure the replacement filters are going to be made available. This purifier is listed on the company's Amazon store page, but I don't find the filter for it on Amazon. The filters for similar purifiers that appears on the company's wesbsite go for $30, and they only accept AmazonPay. Only accepts AmazonPay??? I called the company about not being able to find the filter, and they said the filter for this Airmega 100 should be showing on their website some time in March.Their office is in California. Their phone number is listed on their company website under \"Support/products & order\", and they do have an email address. And they did answer the phone. So this is all good.The price of this purifier on their website is currently listed $35 higher than the present one on Amazon at $93.66. This purifier is very light. But there is no handle anywhere on it to help you move it if you want to move it to another room. A handle could have been just a little indentation in the side of the body, but there isn't one.FROM THE MANUFACTURER manual: \"Coway air purifiers have been proven to trap dust, pollen, dander, viruses and bacteria in the air based on KCL (Korea Conformity Laboratories) testing.\"This purifier and its filter looks absolutely no different from the other purifier that I have, so I trust that it does what the manufacturer claims it does.",

                "reviewText": "I already own a few air cleaners by different manufacturers and one particular brand is actually quieter than this one. However, the quiet one had some strange smell to it. I really like the cool light changing feature (you can turn it off) and how it does not emit any smell. This air purifier does make audible noise but it acts as a very nice white noise machine. I am using this in a 600sq ft. room and it seems to clean the air well. The housing feels sturdy and well made. The whole unit feels like it has good weight to it which I really like. My previous air purifiers were lighter than this even though they were higher in price. I would definitely recommend this air purifier and I may get another one for the kids room.",

(haha) I like that it has a colored light indicator of the air quality. (Blue - Good, Green - Moderate, Orange - Unhealthy, Purple - Very Unhealthy) It has an automatic mode which adjusts with air quality. There is a sleep mode that is very quiet.
