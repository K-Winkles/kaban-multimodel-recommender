Does Clarifion require installation? Just open the box and plug it in! It starts working as soon as it\u2019s plugged in, so you\u2019ll have it releasing negative ions in less than 60 seconds. Will it work on any outlet? Yes! It works in any standard outlet, making it incredibly convenient to use in any room, even in hotels and offices! How noisy is it when on? It\u2019s nearly silent as it works, so you\u2019ll never hear it. Plus, customers love the discreet blue nightlight.",

However, I recently came across the Clarifion unit, which I have found to be a valuable addition\u2014remarkably user-friendly. Upon receiving the unit, I simply unpacked it, plugged it in, and that was it\u2014no more hassle. This eliminates the need for purchasing expensive air filters and is particularly suitable for a mid-sized room (mine is placed in the family room). I intend to acquire additional units for the bedrooms and kitchen.The unit operates silently, and its functionality is indicated by a discreet blue light. Say goodbye to dust, dander, pollen, and unwanted odors!I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't really had this long enough to know whether it works well, or not. I bought it for my bedroom, that gets dusty & stuffy. However, I don't believe I'll be able to use it because the power light (blue light) is so bright that it lights up my whole bedroom and keeps me awake at night. Blue light is not good for you while sleeping. So, I'll either have to unplug it at night, which kind of defeats the purpose, or move it to another room, which also defeats the purpose, so I'm a little disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a small bathroom that can occasionally smell stale. I saw reviews that said it was amazing in a large room, so figured a small bathroom would be great. Nope.In fairness -- the use is extremely easy -- open the box and plug in. I was even able to plug it into an outlet approximately 4 feet from the floor - close to the \"ideal\" 5 feet from the floor (which would be very unusual in a non-bathroom.) I closed the door and left it overnight and most of the next morning. I walked in close to 24 hours later - no difference at all. OK, it's a small device.... maybe it takes some time? So I left it for 2 more days - plugged in, 24 hours/day, no one in or out of the room. MAYBE there was a slight difference in the air at that point -- SLIGHTLY less stale? But definitely not $40 worth of change, especially if it requires multiple days to make even that slight difference. So I decided to unplug it to package it back up for return.That's where things got a bit frightening -- the device was HOT to the touch -- not just warm, but HOT...hot enough I had to drop it onto the counter after unplugging it. I was shocked (figuratively, not literally electrocuted). This is a device you are supposed to plug in and forget about -- the \"warning\" said to wipe it down every 10 - 14 days, but this had been 3 days and it was HOT. I can't imagine where it would be after 14 days?! I got online in surprise and discovered the reviews about it catching fire -- I have ZERO doubt or surprise. I can't imagine if you plugged this in and left it for a month or more -- which it would be easy to do!Bottom line? It would be great if a small plug in device could ionize the air and make the room air fresh and pure...but it's definitely NOT worth burning down your house to get that fresh air!",
