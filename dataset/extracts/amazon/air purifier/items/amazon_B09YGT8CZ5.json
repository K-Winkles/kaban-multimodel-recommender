                "reviewText": "I purchased this air purifier to cut down on dust and improve air quality in my home. I live in the middle of 3 very busy roadways close by, no matter how often you clean it, there's dust. I put it in a small bedroom where family was visiting. I had no idea when I purchased it that we would have a horrible week of air quality, smokiness everywhere due to a wildfire within miles of us. I do not own an air conditioner, so this really and truly helped the air quality for my family members, including a baby and toddlers. The smokiness was everywhere and ash and soot could be seen on everything outside of my home, even small black particles floating through screens in my home initially. The weather people told us to keep our windows closed, but on some of the muggiest days that was a challenge itself. I was very impressed by this small but mighty air purifier. It saved the day. In all honesty you could still smell some smoke on the worst days, but overall it made the air so much better. My family members were pleasantly surprised also. I don't know what we'd have done without it. I purchased others as well. If found the price reasonable and shipping time very good. I would recommend this air purifier, as you honestly never expect things to happen, but you'll be glad you have this when they do. I find the sound is fine, that didn't bother me whatsoever or my family members even as the baby and toddlers took naps or went to sleep at night. I'd recommend this to others. Thank you.",

Even if you turn the light off it still beams through where the little light indicators are for the fan and power. It's terribly bright when you are trying to sleep with the purifier in your bedroom. If the light hits your eye at a certain angle it is just blinding. Overall though it does work to filter the air. It doesn't pick up a lot of the dust but the air does feel cleaner. I ordered replacement filters for it from the same seller, Aeroeve brand, and it has been 17 days today and they still have not even shipped. Yes, I am quite disappointed in that.",
