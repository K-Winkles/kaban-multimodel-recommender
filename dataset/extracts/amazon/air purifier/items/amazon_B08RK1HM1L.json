                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Cat Allergy Sufferers, Quiet Operating, Covers Large Area",
                "reviewText": "My wife has been suffering from allergic reactions (red, itchy, gunky eyes) to 4 cats that we recently adopted (we had never had cats before as adults), and putting a couple of these in ours house have helped with her cat allergies quite a bit. We put one of these in the fairly large \"cat room\" portion of the house, which is where the cats always stay, and one in our bedroom. Those two rooms also seem to be a lot less dusty now. The manufacturer recommends cleaning the filters twice a week, but we've found that cleaning them just once a week works well for us. The filters are very easy to pull out to clean. To clean them, I take the filters outside and brush them off (the top side only) with a fairly large, soft brush, which is quick and easy. The manufacturer says that you can also clean the filers by holding a vacuum cleaner hose near the filters to suck out all of the dust and particles, but they also give a brush cleaning option, and that works great for us.The instruction manual is simple, well-written, and easy to understand. It tells you everything you need to know about the unit. Things that I especially like about this air purifier: (1) It automatically senses how dirty the air is and automatically adjusts the fan speed accordingly; (2) It is extremely quite, even when the fan is running at high speed (we have one of these in our bedroom, and we sleep just fine with it on, and almost don't even notice that it's on); (3) It has a button lock feature that allows you to lock the buttons so that children or pets can't accidentally turn it off when you want it to keep running (very important in our \"cat room\"); (4) You can easily turn off the light inside the unit and dim the control button lights with one quick press of a button (especially good if you're using one in a bedroom like we are); (5) This unit is surprisingly small for an air purifier that works in a such a large area (which is another great feature of it), since it is effective in a room or area up to 547 square feet in size.This unit seems to be of high quality, and we expect these air purifiers to serve us well for a very long time. The manufacturer recommends replacing the filter about every 3 to 6 months. We've only had our units for a month, so we haven't had to replace the filters yet, BUT we did go ahead and order a couple of replacement filters so that we have them ready when we do need them. I would recommend that you do this also, since they seem to go out of stock from time to time. (SEE: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0972N3G4L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 )NOTE: If you have a power outage, even a brief power interruption that only lasts for about one second or so, these units will automatically turn off, and will still be off when the power comes back on, which means that you will have to turn them back on again after any power interruption. (We discovered this recently when we had a short power-off blip in our home.) So, it's always a good idea to check them from time to time (especially if you've been gone from home for a while) to make sure that they are still on, like you want them to be. This is easy to forget about doing, since they run so quietly.We are very pleased with these, and we highly recommend them.",

I also have a large expensive model (Germ Guardian) but it makes a lot of noise and is not suitable for the bedroom. This YIOU unit was by FAR the quietest and this is why I am buying a second one - for the bedroom. One thing I noticed when taking the plastic off the filter (do not forget to do this) is how junky the construction of the filter was - the paper edging of it was falling apart - but that didn't seem to relate to the function of the thing so I am still buying another of these.",
