                "reviewText": "I've got Coway Airmega AP-1512HH, Mila Air Purifier, BISSELL air320, BLUEAIR Blue Pure 411, and now a Dyson Big+Quiet. -- Yes, too many.BISSELL fan is annoyingly loud with a tiny rattle to it. Dislike it, put it in garage.BLUAIR is just tiny and when fan spins up is loud... you gotta have a tiny room for it to make sense, I guess.. Coway is just so much better in every way.Mila is fine, I have it in an office. Filters seem expensive for size, but the auto fan control works well.. 90% of time its totally silent. If someone burns something in kitchen its quick to ramp fan and gets a bit loud, but that's what you want, to get air clean and ASAP and it then gets silent again. It'd be great if not so pricey.Coway seems best value for money. Fan moves a lot of air for how quiet it is. Filters are cheap enough. Its very quiet on low speeds, does get loud at max fan but it moves a lot of air. Only has like blue/green/red light doesn't give exact numbers for particulate.. only downside, but its so cheap can't complain. Auto fan control works. Its just hard to beat the Coway the value is so high.But then we've moved into a new house with a big open floor plan and 12ft ceilings.. its just a big area. None of others really handle that much space, so got a Big+Quiet. And no regrets.- It is big, so normal rooms probably silly large. But in big enough room it doesn't look out-of-place. And IMO it generally looks good.- With fan at 10/10 its quieter than Coway/Mila at max fan while moving more air. With fan at 5 its quiet, but audible if room is otherwise silent. But if couple people are in room doing anything they'll be making too much noise to hear it at 5/10. When fan is on auto and drops down to 1-2 its really hard to hear even in a silent room.- The app works fine. Remote works. I prefer app.- The wheels are nice. Not that you'll move it often, but when you do it glides effortlessly. We've been testing out how it looks in different places and wife rolls it around and doesn't ask me to move it for her. Longterm probably won't move it often, but still nice feature.- I like how long the filters claim to work. Don't mind paying a lot for filter if it'll last awhile. Mila for example has a $59-99 filter they want you to replace every 6 months, its just crazy expensive. Dyson says up to 5 years for $170 filter.And I really nothing to complain about. If you have large area this is air purifier to get.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical and hesitant to purchase this unit because of the steep price tag. But it turned out to be one of the best online purchases I\u2019ve made. It is powerful yet very quiet. The air quality sensors are quite accurate. It detects changes in the air when my wife cooks and self adjusts the speed accordingly. It works well in a large room (mine is ~1500sqft) and I could feel the breeze 20+ ft away. Setting up was easy and with the MyDyson app you can view different parameters including Air Quality, PM2.5, PM10, VOC, NO2, formaldehyde, Humidity and Temp. Highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This is, without a doubt, the best air purifier I have used. There are a few things I'd like to see changed, added and improved but I still think that it was very much worth it. Addressing some of the positives first:- I personally love the modern and classic Dyson design and styling. This is very much subjective but I'm a big fan even though it may strike some people as a very sleek trashcan.- Build quality is fantastic and all components of the design are clearly well thought out and addressed. It has wheels making it easy to maneuver around the house and to adjust directions.- LCD display is easy to read and intuitive.- Air purification has so far been fantastic. I don't have the means to measure it precisely, but I have air purifiers in rooms directly adjacent to the living room where the Dyson is situated and since using the Dyson my air quality readings on the other purifiers shows a drastic improvement in air quality.- In addition to what I mentioned above, the effective area of this purifier is fantastic. It easily covers my entire living room. From a pure performance standpoint, this is an excellent purifier and is the main reason why I am so happy with it. Filters are affordable and long lasting.Now to address some of the negatives and other observations:- No smart home integration which seems like a big minus here, even though it is not advertised as such. There is no remote/smartphone control at all which I find very surprising. It would be great to set it to a schedule or have it adjust based on air quality. However, I wouldn't be surprised if this could be addressed via a firmware update if the hardware is capable of doing so but that is purely speculative.- Air quality reading is limited to Co2 only and there are only two power levels. It would be nice to have more data available and have more fine tuning abilities.Besides those few things, I still think this air purifier has made a great addition to my household. The wide area of coverage and filter lifespans make this a superior air purifier. Even though it is a significant investment, it is worthwhile if you are serious about a top performing air purifier.",
