I have it in the middle of our top floor (we have a split level home, top floor is about 1000sqft by itself), close to the kitchen and as soon as I'm cooking something, this picks it up fast and goes to work quickly! Definitely feel the air is cleaner and the smells from the food is quickly gone. We also tried the \"fragrance\" air freshener it comes with, but it didn't last much, I think they should have included at least 3 of those little discs as a starter pack, the one it came with only lasted like a week then it stopped providing that fresh smell. Still a great investment, we check the filter often and it definitely picks up a lot from our air. Will buy another one for our bottom floor for sure!",

I just wanted a smaller unit to make my place to have as much clean air as possible.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because of the \"never change\" feature. However, after doing a little research, it appears that Shark does not have replacement filters for it. I'm debating sending it back because it will be useless after a few years. I doubt that the filter in mine will last 5 years because I have 3 cats and the unit has been running for 12 hours and still is not above 75 air quality. That number reduces when a cat walks near it, when I cook, or when I open a window.I do like the air freshener and the fact that you can adjust how much is used. It has a nice smell and is not too overbearing.So, I'll try it for 2 weeks to see if it can get above 90. Hopefully, Shark will stand behind their product and let me return it for a full refund.",

                "reviewText": "Like the AUTO mode where it adjusts the fan speed based on the dirtiness of the air. Does a great job. Good for a room or two. Don't think it will do the sqft listed by mfg. I wish they made a separate lid to direct the air (sideways) like an me sleeping in bed etc.. It seems to say the air is dirty when there are large particles in the air, including water.",

                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews of SEVERAL air purifiers on the market I chose this SHARK Never Change unit primarily due to the reusable side filters and the projected 5-year HEPA filter.We like it so much we bought this one in grey/black and moved our white unit to our basement. Right out of the box we set the unit on Auto Mode and it started out at Blue 96%. Whisper quiet it took approximately 45 mins for the display to show Blue 100%.Very much appreciate the almost completely silent operation and the choices of Bright, Dim or No illumination for the readout.Was skeptical at first whether it was doing anything but it does change from 100% to 95% depending on if our 3 Bernese Mountain dogs are walking past or playing near it or if an outside door opens etc.I believe the 1300 sq ft to be fairly accurate as we have ours in our \"Great Room\" with 30' ceilings on our main floor. It seems to be drawing in from our Master bedroom, study and sitting room.We have noticed a visible difference in dust for sure! We have a lot of black shelves and tables and the lack of normal dust was more than noticeable after two days. Can't make any guarantees that you'll never dust again, but you won't need to as much.I highly recommend trying this air purifier out for yourself. We had been researching buying one for over a year and the biggest drawback is the price of replacement filters which seem to need to be changed every 3 months. Not cost effective. This unit utilizes 3 filters with the two side filters easily removable for quick cleaning. These filters will capture dog fur or any large airborne debris which helps the HEPA filter do it's job.The Fragrance Pod is exactly the same as in our SHARK vacuum. Very light and not overbearing.There are also several HEPA filters that can be used to replace the original 5-year filter from SHARK or on Amazon.I highly recommend this unit for yourself.",

                "reviewText": "Bought 4 of these to replace my older units thinking newer would be better. Got all four of them setup and put them on auto and they turn off after 5 minutes (Eco Mode) and never come back on. They sat off (in Eco Mode) for four days showing 100 air quality and never came back on. I verified with a tissue that no air was moving through the unit for four days. An \"air purifier\" can't clean to air if it's off and not moving any air. They work fine in manual mode but stay off in Auto Mode (once in Eco Mode).My old purifiers (Winix 5500-2) would always be on when in auto mode and it increased the fan speed when the air quality decreased. To test, I placed my old Winix 5500-2 next to the Shark and the Winix said there was poor air quality and cranked up to level 3 while the Shark showed perfect air quality, remained off (Eco Mode), and never came on.Crazy to spend $300 each to have them sit off and not be cleaning the air. I suspect thats how they claim 5 year filter life, the units are off in Eco Mode and not using the filters so they last forever.Can't speak to how they actually clean the air since they never ran for four days I had them out.",
