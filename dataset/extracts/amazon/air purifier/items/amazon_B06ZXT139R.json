That has worked really well but there are no air vents in there. This caused the air to stagnate and dust became a problem in there. This little machine removed 90% of the dust (even from surfaces) in 24 hours. After a few days it was completely gone. I feel like it also moves the air and pulls air in the room if only a small amount. It is a great device. It is very quiet and my wife can take phone calls with it on high about 3 feet away. We have a Honeywell HEPA in every room and I can't imagine life without them!",

Noise level... on HIGH I don't mind... lower settings I honestly do not notice it.I changed a filter after a recent VERY dusty home improvement project and it was amazing what the Filter looked like! REALLY caught ALOT from the air. VERY Happy with the Purchase and in the Kitchen it really helps to eliminate the cooking odors...",

The noise from the machine isn't bad at all I keep mine on medium, high makes a little more noise than I like. I sleep just fine with it on medium at night and the noise does not bother me at all. The low setting you can barely even tell its on. I'm going to be buying a few more for my other rooms.",
