                "reviewText": "This air purifier is ideal for my studio apartment and accomplishes what it claims. It's really quiet on speed 1 and 2, a little more sound on 3 like a normal fan. It does not keep me awake at night, and I find the blue indicator lights to be soothing. I was sneezing and blowing my nose a LOT due to pollen, etc, until I began using it, and now my apartment air must be much cleaner because I'm rarely doing either!... even when I open a window for fresh air for a time.I pretty much run it all the time when I'm home, as the affects are so noticeably positive.The only sort of cons I found were that the control buttons are super sensitive. Initially I was pressing them harder than was necessary and they weren't working consistently. It was by accident that I discovered I should barely touch them. The buttons are made of less quality material than the rest of the unit, but it doesn't really take anything away from the unit's appearance. And the other thing is that the buttons are completely white, with no type of contrast, so until you know without looking which is which, they can be hard to differentiate.The unit is a good size and has a clean, modern look so it is a nice accent to the decor. A nice looking unit that is totally functional! Bravo!",
