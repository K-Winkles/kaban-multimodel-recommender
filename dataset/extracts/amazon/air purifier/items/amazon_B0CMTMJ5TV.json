                "reviewText": "I bought the MORENTO Smart Air Purifier to replace another brand that I had for many years. After using this air purifier for over a while now, I would highly recommend this for anyone desiring clean fresh smelling air inside your home. I have to say that the Moento Air Purifier not only replaces but performs much better than my old unit. I have health concerns and need to make sure that I breathe clean air as much as possible. With this device I can. This Air Purifier has HEPA filtration that effectively prevents even the smallest particles in the air that are harmful to your health from remaining in your environment. I have a dog and am allergic to many airborne pollutants. I have noticed a big difference in the way I can now breathe easier, my room seems to smell better and accumulate less dust on flat surfaces.The Morento Smart Air Purifier is small enough to fit into almost any room in my house without seeming to be out of place yet large enough to get the job done well. I love the smart features that allow me to read and adjust features from my smart phone. As well as being able to control the device from my phone, I can use the control panel on the top of the purifier. It comes with a LED screen that tells you exactly what is going on with the purifier from Air quality, WIFI connectivity, filter status and other things. It will allow you to choose different air/fan speeds manually or allow it to control the air speed based on the quality of air. This is the setting I prefer as it constantly monitors and controls the purification of the air. It has a sensor on the rear of the device that reads the air quality which is how it knows how to automatically choose the air speeds.I keep this particular device in my bedroom keeping the front and back 15 or more inches away from walls and surfaces. I love the fact that it is so quiet in sleep mode that you don't know it is running. It also dims the display so as not to disturb your sleep. During the day I typically leave it in auto to let it do its thing.Setup was a breeze. You download the app to your phone, and a minute or so you are up and running. You can control this device through Alexa or Google to make it even more convenient.Well thought out product that I hope will keep my air cleaner for years to Come. I have researched the replacement filters that you may need to replace after about 6 months use, I find that they are reasonably priced on Amazon and other vendors at reasonable prices.",
