Clears the air quickly, and the smell is gone within a small amount of time. Love the noise to cover fireworks for my pups to be able to sleep and not get upset during the firework displays. We also, love the night light on the purifier. Easy to set-up and use right out of the box! Super glad I made this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I've never used an air purifier before, and it's a little larger than initially expected but still highly mobile and fairly lightweight. I could tell quickly that the living room felt less stuffy and the air seemed crisper and thinner. So the machine seems to be purifying well, but I wouldn't say it covers the SQFT that it claims it does (but that seems to be a blanket advertisement claim among air purifiers). It isn't as quiet as I thought it would be when running at full speed, but it is very quiet running on the sleep function.I am quite disappointed in the 'aromatherapy' portion of the machine (and that's the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). I used 3 different brands of essential oils to make sure that the oil I initially tried wasn't the problem. But even if you completely drench the pad, it's not going to last very long or smell like much in the room. (I would need to use half a bottle of oil to get it to produce any scent throughout the day, and that's not worth the price of oil.)Overall, it seems like a good choice for the price and a decent air purifier (just don't count on the extra feature).",

I love the three settings on it and the option for the nightlight. My grandbaby recently had the flu. Cranked it up while babysitting. Maybe just a coincidence but has been 5 days and no one else in the house got the flu. I removed the filter to see how it does with pet hair and it is working. The filter has a good amount of dust and dog fur captured!",

After just one day, we could tell a difference in our home. There was less dust collecting on our floors and fewer particles in the air. We recently added a second dog and had seen an increase. We have a two story house and had been moving the one we had to and down but decided to get another to have one for each level. We run it 8 or so hours per day. It\u2019s quiet and easy to use.",
