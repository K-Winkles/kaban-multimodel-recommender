                "reviewText": "This is a small portable travel air purifier with UV-C from Homedics a trusted home brand. There is only one power button which has the unit off, low, or high. When the unit is off, the blue power button is lit up. When the unit is on low or high, the entire top of the unit emits on/off glow effect of blue light. You cannot turn the light on or off independently. The amazon listing at the time of my purchase stated \"Power Source Battery Powered\" but unfortunately this is incorrect. There is actually no battery built into the unit, and it must be plugged in to power on. For some people this is not an issue. I had intended on using it for travel, so that rules it out for me as I would need to then also pack a separate battery which negates the portability of the unit for me. However, if this doesn't affect your use, it's a very quiet and nice purifier. Bonus points for coming with a USB-USB-C cable and the unit is UL certified for safety.",
