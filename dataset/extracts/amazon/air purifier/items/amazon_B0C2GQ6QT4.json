One of the standout features of this air purifier is its quiet operation. Even when running at higher fan speeds, the noise level remains minimal, allowing for undisturbed sleep or work. The HEPA filter effectively captures and eliminates common airborne contaminants such as dust and pollen. This air purifier helps to reduce my symptoms of allergies a lot. Maintaining the ABC Air Purifier is hassle-free. The filter replacement process is straightforward and doesn't require any complex steps. Considering its affordable price point, this Air Purifier offers good value for money.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this unit for only four days but I didn't want to wait longer to share my opinion. I have loved this air cleaner from the first minute I saw it. The LCD display is a great feature and shows fan speed, filter change and real time particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) which should be between 0 - 12.A too high amount of PM2.5 can contribute to respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease and cancer.I did challenge the air cleaner and smoked inside. The PM went up to 999 but it cleaned the air down to 12 in no more than one hour. On fan speed one you can hardly hear it running. It also has a timer to turn on or off. It would be nice if it came with a remote control though. I can't say anything negative about this air purifier. The filter last about 6 months but I can't confirm that yet. They cost 30.-",

Now the air stays crisp. When I first got the machine, my air quality was not terrible. It was in the teen digits. Now, it stays in the single digits (3-4). And, it has taught me that some food I cook are real pollutants. I did not realize. I cooked pork bacon, and the machine rose to triple digits. It was working overtime to clean the air back, but within 30-40min it was out of the red and back in good quality air. I may reconsider bacon going forward. That machine doesn't lie about air pollution. Even when I fried chicken it go to the 50s but never triple digits like the bacon. This machine covers about 1300sq ft.",
