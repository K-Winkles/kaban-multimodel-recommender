                "reviewText": "I noticed the air is cleaner. I have to dust more because the dust or floaties can't float in air but I breathe better. Mine is in the bathroom and I never had to dust much. Once I plugged it in soon there was dust. So I'd rather dust than breathe stuff in the air. The negative charge works. When the sun shines in you can see all the floaties, especially after a remodel with drywall sanding. That always bothered me but I didnt know how to clean the air. I'm hoping it helps with static this winter. I recommend trying it. Will buy more for other rooms.",

I plugged this unit behind her place on the couch. She has neither complained nor sneezed as much. I used a multi-plug receptacle above our regular socket to give a greater distance between the wall & the ion-generating wire so as to not blacken the walls paint. This has to be done on these cheaper units. You get what you pay for.",

                "reviewText": "I noticed some difficulty with my vocal chords while speaking. I use my voice in my profession so I needed to get to the bottom of the issue. I realized the problem was the pet dander I\u2019m around and I needed relief. This small ionizer has worked like crazy amazing. I sleep with it on in my bedroom at night and the difference is absolutely incredible. I had to write this review.",
