It has been wet and anyone with pets knows the \"wet dog\" smell when they come inside. With this unit I do not have that at all. Would definitely recommend purchasing this unit.",

                "reviewTitle": "Works great for keeping dust under control",
                "reviewText": "One of the biggest reasons I've always wanted an air purifier is because I have a wood stove and every time you clean ashes out of a wood stove, it gets Ash dust everywhere. This air purifier has helped a lot with that.Air purifier has a triple layer filter in it that catches bigger debris, smaller debris, and even particles as small as what you find in smoke gets gathered by this thing. I've been using it off and on for 2 weeks now and when my mother came to visit just the other day, she noticed just how much fresher it smelled in the house compared to before. I do have a cat that uses litter box from time to time and that does keep it a little smelly and this has been doing a great job of keeping those odors down as well.The main reason I got this air purifier was for dust that kicks up whenever I clean out my wood stove. I actually put the air purifier in between my wood stove, and my computer to minimize the amount of dust that gets into the computer. In the winter time I normally have to blow out the computer about once a week whenever I clean the ashes out of my stove, these past two weeks I haven't had to clean it out and there's hardly any dust or ashes in it. It's easily reduce the amount of ashes that are spreading through the air normally by 90 to 95%.The air purifier filter itself is very easy to replace, the back flap just pulls off by grabbing onto one side or the other and lightly pulling and you just pull out the filter and put in a new one. And the manual they do tell you you can clean the filter out by blowing it out, but it will eventually need changing.The air purifier has an automatic setting that detects when there's more stuff in the air and revs up the fan to compensate and pull stuff in faster. This seems to work well as it's mostly what I use. When I start cleaning up the ashes after about 15 to 20 seconds I'll hear it start kicking up and the fan starts going faster to pull in more ashes and other debris in the air. With the automatic setting selected, the air purifier is pretty quiet overall unless it has to rev up the fan to suck in more debris edge of the air. Then it can get to be as loud as a normal desktop fan on a lower setting. Still a lot more quiet than I was expecting it to be.Even works well for smoke. Sometimes when you open a wood stove, a plume of smoke will come out. This happened to me just the other day and the sensor number that is on the air purifier to show you the quality of the air shot from one, which is practically perfect there up to 112 as it was sucking in the smoke. As it cleared more more the smoke out of the air, the number eventually went down until it made it back down to one.Even while cooking this purifier ends up picking up particles out of the air and sucking them in. I have the air purifier in my living room which is one room away from the kitchen and the fact that it's able to suck particles from one room to the other and nullify them actually shocked me. I never even thought of that as a possibility.This is the only air purifier I have ever used, but I can say that with my first experience I am pleased with this. I would have loved to have had something like this 10 years ago while I still living with my father as he was a heavy smoker and I personally cannot stand cigarette smoke. This would have helped keep the air filtered a lot better than nothing did.If you're looking for a strong air purifier that seemingly has a lot of power to pull in particles, this is a pretty solid option. Between the auto settings, the timer that's on it, and it's ability to show you the quality of the air at a glance of the display, it's nice to know that I'm breathing fresher air thanks to this air purifier. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a air purifier.",

                "reviewText": "I previously had a basic air purifier, which only included 3 fan modes and auto mode. The features on this air purifier are blowing my mind. The idea of the UV light is very interesting although I can't really tell if it works or not. I will say the sensor seems to work very well. Whenever we are cooking or vaping near it for example the air quality will briefly change as the purifier works harder to clean the air. I also really like the sleep feature. It's a nice feature to use throughout the day to help clean up the overall appearance, since there is so much going on without the sleep feature on the display panel. One of my favorite features is the child lock. Simply hold the UV light button for 3 seconds and the settings will be locked until you unlock it using the same method. This is crucial, being within reach of my toddler. She hasn't figured it out yet. It typically runs on the lower fan settings, seeming to have no difficulty keeping the air clean in my home. The fan noise level is mind blowing. If you air is more prone to be contaminated and the fan will run higher you will experience a little more noise. Shockingly quiet on the lower settings though. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "For something so small (roughly about the same size or slightly bigger than an original PS5), it performs exceptionally. Every day I've had it running, and I barely even notice that it's on; it's super quiet! While I don't hear it running, I do notice the noticeably improved air quality. There's way less dust and allergens in the air (both of which are pronounced during these winter months since all windows are closed and people are forced to stay indoors to keep warm) than usual, and that really helps. Operating it is super easy as well; all the icons and their functions are pretty straightforward and it's easy to set up things like a timer and Night Mode.After-sale customer support is yet to be determined. The manual does indicate what model number the replacement air filters have, but I'll have to check whether or not Amazon carries these filters. For now, it seems to work without issues.",

It's like having a little ninja that silently fights off the invisible bad guys in the air. On one hand, it's quiet enough not to scare the fur babies and has this cool color indicator that changes faster than a chameleon when the air quality shifts. Plus, the UV feature? Neat, even if it feels a bit like overkill.On the flip side, the whole \"easy-to-clean\" promise falls a bit short, especially if you're not keen on replacing filters that cost almost as much as a small treasure chest. And if you're expecting it to react to every little thing, like a spritz of hairspray from across the room, you might be waiting a while. Think of it more as a chill friend that's got your back, not a hyper-alert guard dog.In a nutshell, this purifier is a solid pick if you're looking to clear the air without needing a manual the size of \"War and Peace.\" Just don't expect it to perform miracles on command. Good for keeping things fresh, but keep your expectations grounded.",
