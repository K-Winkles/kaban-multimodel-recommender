                "reviewText": "I have animals- cats that are totally inside and dogs that are inside /outside. The smells of dirty, wet dog compete with the cat litter. I also have an adult special needs son who lives with us and likes to keep his door shut. His room gets that funky smell after awhile. I plugged in one of these downstairs near the animal room, and one in his room. I have noticed a tremendous improvement in the air quality. They are really quiet and don\u2019t take up that much room. I recommend them.",
