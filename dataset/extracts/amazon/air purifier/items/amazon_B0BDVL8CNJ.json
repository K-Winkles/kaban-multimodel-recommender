When it's set to the other modes it's extremely quiet, also the app gives me the ability to see filter life percentage, and change a few settings while also controlling remotely!So we moved into an old house, it was pretty musky and I'm sure once we tear down some walls we'll find something nasty. But after running a full day the musky smell is completely gone! It really filters out the air and makes it fresh. It does run a little loud but honestly it doesn't bother me. I enjoy the white noise. I also vape inside the house, and what ever side of the room I'm at I can see the quality change as it pulls the vapors right to it. Honestly I'll probably buy one for every room to save my windows and electronics from vape build up.I'll definitely buy my second one once we're ready to start demo on the walls.Short and sweet:Works well, fresh air in one day!Funk smells are gone!Works phenomenal in the Sq footage advertisedPulls all of the air even from far away.Accurate air quality detectionMild white noise",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Dreo Air Purifier for my large bedroom through Amazon, and it has been an absolute game-changer in terms of air quality. It effectively removes allergens, dust, and other impurities from the air, allowing me to breathe in a cleaner and fresher environment.Unfortunately, after about a week of usage, I encountered an error code (EU) which prevented the machine from turning on. However, I reached out to Dreo's online support, and I was pleasantly surprised by their prompt response. The troubleshooting techniques they provided were helpful, but it turned out to be an internal board issue. Without hesitation, Dreo swiftly arranged a replacement air purifier to be shipped to me.Their customer service was truly exceptional. Not only did they respond quickly, but they also demonstrated a genuine concern for resolving the issue. The replacement arrived promptly, and I'm delighted to say that it works wonders, just like the original unit did.I must commend Dreo for their dedication to ensuring customer satisfaction. Despite the initial hiccup, their swift action and commitment to resolving the problem left a lasting impression on me. It's reassuring to know that a company stands behind its product and genuinely cares about its customers' experiences.Overall, I highly recommend the Dreo Air Purifiers for Home, especially for large rooms and bedrooms. The purifier itself is highly effective, noticeably improving the air quality, while the exceptional customer service provided by Dreo ensures a positive ownership experience.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these due to the great reviews. Neither of them are working. They both are giving me the same \"E U\" error message. Nothing in the manual covers what this means or what to do about it. I called customer service and spoke to a live agent that took my information and told me to wait on an email with further instructions.Update:The company did call me a couple days later and did act to repair my purifiers by sending an update to them which fixed the issue. They were very diligent about calling me to resolve after that point. They also sent me two free air filters $100 value (free shipping) to rectify the issue.I am satisfied that they did their best to resolve this issue and my air purifiers are working well.I did purchase another item from them since they did fix this issue and demonstrated they have good customer service protocols.",

                "reviewText": "This unit is exactly as described. iPhone app was easy to download and install and set up. All unit functions are available from my phone.The reason I decided to try this unit is that I suffer from some allergies that affect my sleep. I only get about 4 hours uninterrupted sleep at a time. I have been running unit 24 hours a day for 2 weeks now and I definitely notice the difference. It has operated efficiently and quietly. My sleeping has improved immensely and I am getting 6-7 hours now.To me Factory Support is as equally important as the operation of the unit.I was quite disappointed with Amazon. Three (3) days after I received the unit and started using it, there was a price reduction (on Amazon) for exactly same the same unit. Even though I purchased on Amazon, paid Amazon and Amazon got benefit of the sale, and the profit mark-up, I was told they would not \u201cprice match\u201d. So I was stuck with the higher price that I paid.So I contacted the manufacturer, a ticket was opened, and I was contacted by a customer service agent (Ian).Ian was very courteous, knowledgeable and assured me he would take care of the issue. A solution was agreed upon and implemented in a timely stress free manner.DREO AIR PURIFIER \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0fDREO CUSTOMER SERVICE \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0fAs I mentioned, customer service is as important to me as the actual product. So it lead me to check out all their products on the Dreo website. I was not aware of all the products they manufacture. Given this present transaction, I would be very comfortable buying from them again.One in particular that I am interested in is the Dreo ChefMaker Revolutionary Combi Fryer Oven.",
