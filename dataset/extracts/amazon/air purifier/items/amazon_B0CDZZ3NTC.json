                "reviewText": "I love these - bought 4 of them for each room. With several cats, these are a must! Love the speed, time, and light settings. The night setting is very quiet. I am a light sleeper, and it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. My favorite part is the diffuser inserts. I use them for different essential oils. I took one star off because at first these purifiers were giving out very strong plastic/chemical odor. It took 2-3 days of running them on high setting in a vacant bedroom, and a drop or two of the aromatic oil in the diffuser helped. Also, the replacement filters are on the pricy side, but hope they last.",
