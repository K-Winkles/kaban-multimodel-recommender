The air feels cleaner, and my allergies haven't flared up, it shows this purifier works like a charm. The machine itself is attractive and much larger than it looks, so it has a strong effect of cleaning the air, and it has three nice colors of light that make it look modern and sleek.This purifier is also very quiet, it sounds like a small fan running in the background, and the sound doesn't interfere with my ability to fall asleep and listen to TV. It especially runs exceptionally quietly in sleep mode, with noise as low as 15dB, so sleep mode really works.I would recommend this air purifier and will keep updating this review later with its usage and longevity.",

I set up for subscribe and save and when they come, I'll replace them.But very happy so far. 2nd Vewior I've owned and unlike other models, they seem to keep the same style or at least keep selling the filters for a reasonable price.

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my daughter who is always staying sick, stuffed up, sinus problems, etc. I also bought a First Air Quality Monitor to work with the purifier and compare the two readings. At first, when in auto mode, the purifier cycles the same 7 numbers over and over again. Like it wasn't measuring anything, just making a cycle of random numbers. I did start to notice though, when I would come in from outside smoking, if I got within 10 feet of the unit, it would change colors and kick on instantly. So I assume the cycle of the same numbers over and over again is just due to it being idle in auto mode. Eventually I picked up a smaller one for my daughter's bedroom and keeping this one in the living room. It's really quiet while idling, but if picks up on a scent that's not supposed to be there, best bet it kicks in instantly and stays on until it's all clear. Definitely helps.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR in 4 easy pins:\ud83d\udccc The blinking filter light is supposed to tell you that you have less than 100 hours left in the life of your filter. While the purifying aspect of the machine seems to be great (judging by how much less I'm coughing) the filter light is a liar. From what I can tell, it will blink after 2 months regardless.\ud83d\udccc To stop the blinking, press the filter light for 3-5 seconds.\ud83d\udccc I have no idea how to tell if the filter actually needs changing. Maybe when the air quality light turns red and stays red. Or maybe set whatever organizer you use to remind you in six months.\ud83d\udccc Posting a photo of \"old\" filter next to new filter. Little to no difference. Also posting an excerpt from the manual._____FULL REVIEW:Since I am pretty amazingly allergic to...the world, there are several air purifiers in the house running 24/7 (doctor's orders). The house is basically a breathe-safe bubble.This one is quiet when all is well and not even that loud on full blast AND has an auto mode, so it won my bedroom area. For two months, everything was peachy. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdThen the filter light started blinking. I thought that was oddly soon but bought a new one. Thought I got allll the luck on a heavily discounted two-pack. A family member had to switch it out because I'm supposed to limit my exposure to certain contaminates (dust, pollen, etc etc etc) as much as possible or things can get really bad. Like ER bad.But honestly the old filter looked just about the same as the new. Posted pic of side-by-side comparison with my remaining filter. OoTwo month timer, I'm guessing?Plus, replacing the filter DID NOT STOP THE FILTER LIGHT FROM BLINKING. You'd think pulling out a filter then putting in a new one then locking the bottom lid into place would trigger a hard reset, but you'd be wrong. And it's not some sort of safety feature to keep you from trying to trick the purifier because all you have to do is press the blinking light for 3-5 seconds and it stops. New filter or old filter.My purifier didn't come with a manual but I figured it was meant to be looked up online like so many of them are these days, especially since there are so many instructions in the Amazon product page description itself. Good news: there are manuals online, including the official Vewior site. Bad news: none of them quiiiite match up with the Vewior A2 (aka the Vewior Air Purifier CleanAir-A2), even when it says so. One of them told me to unplug the machine, then to use the control panel to reset the light. Like... what? My xude, the control panel doesn't work without power. That freaking paragraph had me searching for a secret compartment. \ud83d\ude11Found out while writing this review that you can download the manual from Amazon. Go to ORDERS \u27a1\ufe0f PRODUCT SUPPORT \u27a1\ufe0f INFORMATION \u27a1\ufe0f PRODUCT DOCUMENTS, then you can download the pdf. It doesn't specifically say, but I *think* the blinking means you have 100 hours left in the life of your filter and you're supposed to touch the light to see the countdown.Except...my filter light has been blinking for well over a week and if you see the photo I took, the old one still looks new. 100 hours \u2797 24 hours \ud83d\udff0 approx 4 days, right? Right\u2049\ufe0f Or is my math that bad???So yeah. I love the auto feature and the light that tells you what state your air is in. I love that you can turn off that same light when you're ready for bed. Purifier actually cleans the air, and a lot of them don't. All great features.But the filter bit is kinda the most important part, yeah? Expensive, too. OO",
