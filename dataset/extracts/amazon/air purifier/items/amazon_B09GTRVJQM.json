                "reviewText": "Product came as advertised, and works great with no issues. Besides air quality, I use it for some white noise at night on the middle fan speed and it's a nice volume. The high fan speed is a bit loud but I can see some folks using that speed for sleeping too. The aroma pad is a nice touch, though it's no replacement for an actual essential oil diffuser. I don't run it constantly, I don't have pets, and the air quality where I am is decent already so I'm coming up on a year of using this, cleaning the pre-filter ocassionally, and the check filter light has never come on. I'll replace the filter eventually but in my case I've already gotten 2x the life out of filter than the expected average lifespan (4-6 months).",

I keep it running on low, and it has stayed fresh for a couple months nowSome reviews have complained that it does not remove dust. I agree, but I don\u2019t think the point of the product is to save you from dusting. It is to freshen the air, and for that, it works great!It is very quiet. On the lowest setting you can barely hear it. On the highest setting you can hear the fan but is not at all loud. It also has a nice unobtrusive design.",
