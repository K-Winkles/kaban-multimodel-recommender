                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this purifier because it is HSA/FSA eligible and I was intrigued by the NCCO technology which I have not seen offered on more popular purifier brands. I got this because we have cats and dogs, and live in a rural area with lots of pollen producing oak trees that leave a yellow pollen layer on everything in the springtime. I end up getting sinus infections and spend oa week or two terribly sick. The basement in my house has a damp moldy smell because the air is stagnant. I plugged this in my 12\u2019 x 20\u2019 basement bedroom. In an hour or so there was a very noticeable difference. When I wake up in the morning, I am no longer congested. I have used another air purifier and noticed improvement, but not as much as with this one. The air smells clean. I think the ncco and hepa combination is very effective at removing pet and damp odors from the air. I ran into the problem that other reviewers have mentioned when the display malfunctions and the EE notification and NCCO light turns red. I emailed support and they said to do this:Air Purifier Fixunplug the unit for 30 seconds or longerplug it back in1. Power the machine off.2. Then hold the power button down until you hear the click. Once you hear the click release the power button and press the fan speed up button. Speed will go up from 3 to 4 and code will appear on the display and unit will shut off.3. Repeat step 2 but when you hear the click , release the power button and press the fan speed down button. Speed will go down one level and a code will appear and the unit will shut off.4. Just power the machine on and the light will be blue.5. If the letters on the display seem off, have the customer unplug the machine and re-plug it. This is to be done after the machine has been reset if necessary.That worked for me and I haven\u2019t had any problems since. I have also tried this upstairs in the living room and it works great. I cranked it up to 10 since there is a lot of open space square footage. After a few hours the air quality is noticeably improved. My nose is less runny and animal odors are gone. This purifier is a bit noisy running on high, but it is a nice white noise so it doesn\u2019t bother me. The video is of the sound running on level 10.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using one since July 14 and am impressed with its performance.I am on the road in a truck camper and , being asthmatic, havebeen concerned aabout air quality. Initially, my concerns were regarding dust and pollen. Recently heavy smoke from wildfires affecting NE Washimgton have resulted in dangerous air quality for me.I am astounded at how good the air is in the camper compared to the smoke, ash, and dust filled air outside. I can occasionally smell a hint of smoke in here after I open the door but the purifier takes it out faster than I could have hoped.I even placed it on the bed, aimed at my face, while I sleep. I no longer wake up in the morning feeling like I've smoked a pack of cigarettes in a smoky bar.Thank you for.this product. You have saved me from the emergency room, and have made my living conditions exponentially better.I just ordered a second unit in case this one fails.",

                "reviewText": "The future of air purification is a mix of both active (emission and use of NCCO, PCO) and passive (HEPA filtration). Westinghouse offers a great option here with NCCO which requires little maintenance and does the trick well to purify your air while actively attaching smells, bacteria, viruses, and more. The design of the unit itself is a bit bland and needs improvement but has a daily small footprint and is easy to use.I intend to either wait for Westinghouse to release new models of these air purifiers or will purchase another within a few months as it's a better investment all-around than passive air purifiers.",
