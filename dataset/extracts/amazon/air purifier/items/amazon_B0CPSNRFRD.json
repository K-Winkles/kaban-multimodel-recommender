The filter is incredibly durable and made from high quality materials, and the machine operates quietly even at the highest setting. The blue night light is a greatly appreciated feature! We have a parakeet, a Great Pyrenees, and a cat, and naturally our living room can get a little musty, but ever since we set up this air purifier the entire living room/dining room/kitchen (a good ~800 sq ft of our open floor plan home) feels light and fresh, even cooking odors (we use A LOT of spice) are gone in a flash. We haven't used the aroma therapy feature yet because of the bird, but I'm looking into safe essential oils because I can't wait to test that feature! The child lock is a huge bonus, as well; my youngest loves to push buttons and is obsessed with anything that looks like a fan, so this was definitely a huge hit with him. Great value for the money, I plan on getting another for our bedroom!",

                "reviewText": ") I really like the design and build quality of this Purifier. It has a soft blue glowing light that you can use as a night light (or turn it off if you don\u2019t want it). It has 3 fan speeds, a timer button (useful if you want it on for a certain number of hours, then it will automatically turn off), a child lock-out button so little ones won\u2019t inadvertently turn it on, and a reset button. The reset is for when you replace the filter after 1440 hours of run time. The machine is fairly quiet, even on high fan speed, and it blows a gentle air from the top. I do not have measuring equipment to verify how much dust/allergens are removed from the air, but the filter is built such that I would believe the manufacturer\u2019s statements. I did place it near the kitchen when we had fragrant food cooking, and it did eliminate the smell within 10 minutes, so that was impressive. It also comes with aromatherapy diffusers, if you like to do that. Replacement filters can be bought off Amazon\u2026..just search for B-D02U filters.",

I usually run it on low with the night light on. On that setting it makes no noise at all that I can hear. High fan setting gets me fan noise but nothing loud or bothersome. I came with all the filters necessary but I unfortunately can't find any information on how to order replacement filters which I will need to do in about 3-4 months, or when the purifier indicates that I need to replace the filter. That's a problematic omission.",

                "reviewText": "A closed up house, in the winter especially, can have a stuffy closed up smell, but not after running this impressive air purifier only one day. Ours is set up near the family room, living room, and kitchen area of the house, and after 5-6 hours I began to notice how fresh the air seemed. To test, I added some lavender essential oil in the air and put the setting on high. Within just a short time, the lavender smell disappeared. Works very well!I found the replacement filter listing in Amazon, then created a List (see below the pricing information on the item listing, click the \"Add to List\" drop-down arrow, create a List - I named mine \"Electronics\"- and now the item is saved and available anytime I'm ready to order it.)We're thinking of ordering a second unit to put near the bedrooms. The unit is very quiet and we like the idea that the air we breathe every night will be clean and clear.",

This purifier has 3-stage filtration by preliminary filtering through outer fabric, then pass through the HEPA filter and finally purifies by the activated carbon filter. There is indicator light to remind the replacement of filter after it has been used for more than 1440 hours.The purifier has three levels of fan speed to select according to different conditions and air quality. Moreover, there is a top aromatherapy diffuser for placing aroma pad so that essential oils can be dropped to create fragrant air. There are totally three aroma pads are provided in the package.I like the night light feature of the air purifier. In addition, there are timer and sleep mode for selection so that the purifier will run quietly with all indicator-lights off and automatically stops after the selected hours. In fact, even it runs at the high-speed fan, the sound is low and won\u2019t be annoying.",

Everything from fan speed to timers and it can be used as a nightlight as well. I have been running it for a couple weeks straight and maybe its just me but it smells better and no dusty smell. I recommend this product because it does everything it says it does. The price point is right and I am happy with my purchase.",

It has several modes of adjustment so that I can run it at full blast during printing or slow it down when I\u2019m just working in my office.The air purifier has a great presentation as is well made, it does come with aromatherapy diffuser pads, it\u2019s a great idea but I have no need of those.
