There was never any huge issue with smell from the litter box before, just very faintly if I forget to clean the scoop trap for a few days. However, I thought I'd throw this in there to potentially fully eliminate any odors and keep the air clean. This small thing works SO well and is very quiet. I run it on Medium continuously and can't smell a single thing in that closet. Love it!",

Although it doesn't filter a large portion of the area, it does enough for where I sit in the living room to keep my living space air-filtered. I like the simplicity and modern design and size. It doesn't look like an eyesore and is very quiet.",

I was giving this as an XMAS gift and was very unhappy about this. The power cable had its twist tie untied, and was stuffed in the box, and the unit smelled dirty.Even if this wasn't the case, I think it's extreme loud for being advertised as something that is meant for a bedroom. This is on low fan too. The fastest speed is so loud it might possibly wake our upstairs neighbors!I would have returned this right away, but it's a large item, and I don't have any boxes large enough to fit it. So it looks as if I'm stuck with it...FULMINARE Direct storefront has since reached out and taken care of this situation. So I wouldn't worry about ordering another.",
