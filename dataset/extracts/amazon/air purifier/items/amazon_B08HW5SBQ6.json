                "reviewText": "I bought this air purifier as I have a mid-size bedroom (~120 feet; large enough that many smaller purifiers were not rated for that room size). I was also looking for an air purifier with HEPA filtration for allergies and filter changes that were reasonably priced. The official replacement filters run from about $45-50 depending on where you get them and last around a year (aftermarket filters are available and can be had for significantly cheaper, if you're willing to take your chances on those). Many other smaller air purifiers have filters that last for much shorter lengths of time and/or secondary pre-filters and end up costing more per year to run, so in the long term this filter will save you a little money there. Filter changes and cleanings are easy (you should vacuum or otherwise clean the filter every 2 months to extend its longevity), but the directions were a little unclear about how to orient the filter. Based on what I've found, the solid black side of the filter labeled BOTTOM should face the bottom cover of the machine.Noise levels with the filter are reasonable. The lowest speed on automatic is quite quiet and serves as nice background noise. Medium speed is louder but tolerable. High speed is loud, but it's never kicked on automatically for me.Note that this comes with PlasmaWave, which generates some ozone as a byproduct (though from what I've read, this is well below harmful levels). PlasmaWave can be toggled off. However, by default, whenever you turn the purifier on or wake it from sleep mode, PlasmaWave turns on. I would NOT recommend this model if this is would annoy you, but it's a non-issue for me.",

                "reviewText": "Super great product, and a good value for the money imo. We have 2, one in the master bedroom and another in the living room.There are three manual modes, and admittedly each one is pretty noisy; I never use these modes.Auto mode is always quiet, and will only pick up when it detects something in the air. I was skeptical of this at first, thinking it would just activate randomly. I noticed however is if I was cooking and there was any smoke, or cleaning with more potent chemicals the air purifier would kick on. We did some painting and sure enough, both our air purifiers kicked on for awhile and eventually slowed back down.Night mode will shut off all lights on the device, and will stay in the quietest mode all night, regardless of air quality. We use this on our bedroom purifier and turn it back to auto in the morning.I don\u2019t have any air quality meters, and I haven\u2019t run any scientific tests on these, but they have been a nice peace of mind for us. I have cleaned the filters as well and they are obviously picking some stuff up! Fortunately they clean super easily and buying new filters seems pretty accessible (several stores sell them, and on Amazon).Definitely recommend",

I thought I'd try going the cheaper route and picked up a pair of Druiap air filters. What a major mistake that was! Now I've replaced my old filter with with the identical model. I use this in a small bedroom and it works great! I sleep so much better with this brand. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very quiet",
                "reviewText": "I like that this has a sleep mode, whereas it is extremely quiet (my fish tank motor is louder) and only the light from the power button is present, which doesn't seem to light up the room but may bother someone who prefers pitch black to sleep. Also, the air smells more crisp and my daughter, who has allergies, has been having far less attacks. It is also light weigh, the filters last forever, it's easy to clean, and you can turn off plasma wave (which I never use because it can be problematic for asthmatics). My only complaint is that I'm not sure how well the air quality sensor works. I've set my son's poopy diaper right next to it and it still said the air quality was good. It also said the air quality was good when I could smell a strong smoke smell from my neighbors burning. However, any time someone is cutting onions in the kitchen, a room away from where the purifier is, it says the air quality is poor to very bad. Other times it randomly says the air quality is poor/bad for no reason discernible to me, and without there being any activities that may have effected the air quality. All in all it does its job and does so very quietly, which is what was most important to me due to having sensory processing issues, especially related to sound.Edit: air quality sensor seems to be working. It's picking up b/o and flatulence.Also, my son has knocked it off the shelf several times and it seems pretty sturdy.The coating on the wire is coming off near the machine.Also, I kept noticing a faint helicopter noise coming from the machine where it does atop a book shelf (not recommended distance from the wall). I was worried it was the fan and quite irritated by the sound. I realized that what was causing it was the slight movement from the fan leading to the wire moving back and forth against the wall where it was pushed between the wall and the shelf. I pulled up more slack and moved the unit out from the wall as much as I could and the sound stopped.Only real complaint : I wish that plasma mode had a lock on it. My kids keep turning it on, which is an issue for the asthma and allergy havers in this house.",

Not bright, but just enough where you can sleep and if you need to get up you won\u2019t trip or stumble over anything. The light is actually very calming \ud83d\ude0a",
