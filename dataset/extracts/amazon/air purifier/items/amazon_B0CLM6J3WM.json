I have been impressed with this air filter on many levels. It is reasonably quiet (but will provide you with adequate white noise if that's what you're looking for). It has also done a good job of filtering the air as evidenced by my lack of recurrence of dip flu.I have found that this is not super intuitive to use... You'll definitely want to read all of the directions to get the maximum value from it. It also does take up a decent amount of space but not more than other similar air filters that I have used in the past.Currently, the price is $129.99 and a $40 off coupon is offered. I feel like that price is reasonable for what you get. I'm not sure that I would be willing to pay full price for it though.",

                "reviewText": "I have numerous Air Purifers. Moreover, I have another Yiou Purifer, a smaller unit, and I have been very pleased with it. Consequently, I decided to acquire this unit, the M1. The M1 is a very nice machine, and it performs admirably in the pursuance of clean air. Specifically, this purifier has a PM 2.5 Air Quality Monitor built in and has a clear, easily readable display. Furthermore, the M1 can cover a large space, area with ease. In sum, the machine is quiet in operation, it has numerous levels of operation, low, medium, high and an auto mode. The auto mode allows analysis of the air actively, and therefore adjust speed levels up or down as warranted. The current price point of $129, less a $50 coupon, for a net price of $79, is an exceptional deal in view of the performance level. I highly recommend the purchase of this product.",
