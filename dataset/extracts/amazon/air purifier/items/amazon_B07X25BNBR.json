        "description": "Levoit air purifiers avoid using UV-C light, an air cleaning method that research has shown can produce harmful ozone and secondary pollution. Please follow the details and FAQs below.Q: How safe are UV purifiers?The biggest issue with UV purifiers is that they emit varying levels of ozone. Even very small amounts of ozone in the air may result in chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, and throat irritation. In fact, The World HealthOrganization (WHO) has issued a warning against people using UV light to sterilize their hands or any other part of their skin.Q: How effective are UV purifiers?Not very. Microbes have to spend some time in front of the UV light before they\u2019re destroyed. The EPA explains that microbes must be exposed to the light \u201con the order of minutes and hours rather than the few seconds typical of most UVGI air cleaners\".",

                "reviewText": "We moved into an incredibly dusty townhouse, I have terrible allergies, and we discovered our neighbors are chain smokers. We now have 3 Levoit air purifiers in our home: Vital 100 (non-smart version), Core Mini and Vital 200S.I initially bought the Vital 100 and put it in our bedroom because I have terrible allergies. It collected a ton of dust and helped a lot with the allergies. I thought I didn't need the smart version but in hindsight the availability of specialty filters and the remote control would be very helpful. It's relatively quiet although on high it's too noisy for me to sleep with. I absolutely love that you can turn the all the control lights off. We tried using this for the cigarette smell but it wasn't very effective except when the smell was very light. It did completely abolish cooking smells though. If I could go back in time I would have ordered the 100S instead but this one works fine.The smoke smell from the neighbors comes into our house through the laundry room which is a very small room. I bought the Core Mini to try to combat it. The Core Mini doesn't really do much to get rid of smells and was definitely overwhelmed by the smoke so now we move it around the house now when the pollen level is high. It works ok for dust and allergens but the range isn't great; you need to be right next to it to notice a difference. On low and medium speed it's barely audible and high is relatively quiet but overall the fan isn't very powerful. The lights on this one automatically turn off after a few seconds making it bedroom friendly. If I could do it again, I would have skipped this one and bought one of the larger ones sooner.Lastly, in an attempt to mitigate the smoke coming from next door, we got the big boi Vital 200S with the add on smoke specialty filter. So far it isn't able to completely remove the smell but it does cut down the severity and will clear it eventually provided the source stops for long enough. It's amazingly quiet on all 4 speeds and the fan moves a ton of air around. I'm disappointed that the auto mode doesn't detect the smoke smell but I can use the app to turn it to high speed as soon as I smell it. You don't have to use the app but it's really easy to set up and connect. The app allows you to set schedules which is really handy and as I touched on earlier, it works as a remote control. As with the others, you're able to turn the lights off completely so it's good for bedrooms. We've only had this running a few days but I'm pretty impressed with what it can do.",

This controls both the short hair that he sheds as well as \"big dog\" smell. Every house guest we have tells us how unbelievable it is that we have a big dog in the house because there is no hint of odor and no hair everywhere. I attribute that to vacuuming regularly and this air purifier. Also, it is small and unassuming so it is perfect for a smaller space.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this air purifier in my bedroom for the past few months. Overall, it's a solid unit that improves the air quality and provides soothing white noise for better sleep. The simple touch controls and digital display allow me to easily adjust the fan speed before bed. I like that I can also set a timer so it automatically shuts off after a few hours.The filtration seems effective and I've noticed less dust in my room since using it. My only real complaint is that the touch controls can be finicky at times. One night, I went to turn it on and tapped the power control, all the light lit up, but nothing happened. I tapped the speed control and it took the unit 1-5 mins to start producing airflow. Had to unplug and plug back in to reset and eventually fixed itself. It might have something to do with software.Other than that minor hiccup, I've been pleased with the air purifier. It's quiet, easy to use, and seems to genuinely make a difference in air quality. For the price, it's a good value in my opinion. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable way to filter dust and allergens from a medium or large room. Just be aware the touch controls may be temperamental on occasion. But it continues to run well for me as a nightly air purifier and white noise machine.",

                "reviewText": "When I moved into my apartment in an old building, it had a kind of dusty smell, my throat was getting dry, and I was coughing a bit. I thought it had to do with the dust levels in the place or the previous resident's pet dander. I got this air purifier and within a day or two I no longer was coughing and it's been great. Sometimes when I don't turn it on for a while my coughing starts up again mildly, but turning it back on solves the problem. It's also pretty effective on cooking smells.On the 1 setting, the purifier is practically silent. On 2 you might hear it if you're close to it and on 3 you'll definitely hear it from across the room but it's not an unpleasant sound -- just like a quiet fan. I've seldom needed to turn it up to 3 (except for the time I burned some toast). It's pretty light and has a built-in cut-out to pick it up with one hand to move around.",

I was a little surprised when it arrived with an American plug, but it came with a converter so I thought nothing of it. Later, when the replacement unit had gone the way of the first in only 2 days of light use, I read the specifications and saw that it\u2019s not made to work on the UK 240v circuit. It\u2019s only rated for 110v, so no wonder they kept burning out, I\u2019m only glad they didn\u2019t start a fire!Thankfully the seller was very god and even sent me a power converter - 240v to 110v - to get the unit working. But please be aware if you buy this unit that it\u2019s not safe for use in the Uk with just a plug adapter.So 3 stars and a warning. But I\u2019ll try the new unit with the converter and hopefully can say lovely things about it, it did seem to work nicely the first time before it burned out. I bought it to keep me safer from catching covid at home or in the office with my 2 coworkers.",
