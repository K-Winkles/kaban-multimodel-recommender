                "reviewText": "We live in a big city so air purifiers to help reduce air particles / dust are important. We also have 2 cats and 2 kids and a good friend with a cat allergy so need something that works well. We bought this unit for our living/dining/kitchen area which is just about 1000sf. Out of the box, this unit was super easy to get started and immediately began clearing the air - the sun was shining through the window so we could literally see the dust flow towards the unit's 2 filters!Here are the PROS IMO:1. Filters are super easy to clean and change - the covers easily pinch to pull off (though would not be easy for a small kid to do) and the filers have a tab to pull out. I vacuum the layer of dust that collect on the outside of the filter, then change every 6-12 months). The outer cover can also easily be cleaned with plain soap and water since it is 100% removable.2. Sound / speeds - there are 3 speeds on this unit. The first level is almost totally silent yet you can still feel a slight breeze from the output. the second is what I would describe as a light fan sound. The third speed is definitely louder and output stronger so we use it when cooking / cleaning or need to purify the entire room quickly for guests. What I do like about the 3rd setting is that it creates a good \"white noise\" for sleeping and drowns out \"city noise\" and other background noise.3. Portable - this unit is light weight and easy to carry from room to room. We transfer it to the kids rooms when they have friends over then back to the kitchen area when cooking, then to the bedroom at night.4. Cost - this was less expensive than many other comparable units that cover large rooms5. Style - this has a nice, clean, modern style that can blend into any room.CONSwell, none yet! If there was an additional feature I would like to see it would be a sensor of just how clean the air is.I highly recommend this unit!",

                "reviewText": "The Medify does do a great job of air purification. Less sneezes and sniffles but it comes at a high price. Basically a glorified PC/ vent fan in a plastic housing with a timer (remind us to buy the filters) and basic fan controls.Would I buy another one? Maybe it truly depends on the price. Someone would have to explain why it is 299 bucks though.Sorry I seem like a grump. I am mostly mad at myself for thinking this would be something gloriously complicated and a major plus in my longevity checklist. It is just an air filter system. Plain and simple.The other thing that set me off today was the change filter indicator went on. I changed the filter with an actual Medify MA-50 filter then I realized I had to reset the indicator.How do you do that? The box didn't say. The filter bag it came in didn't say. I don't see it on the case itself (if it is, it is hard to read/find).Solution; Google it/or Check your Medify FAQ page under MA-50. (Hold the dimmer button for three seconds or at least until it turns off the change filter nag light.Medify: I would up this review if you at least put the instructions on the replacement box instead of more commercials on why I should buy the very same box I bought.I reduced the review to 3 stars after seeing the price go up yet again.

                "reviewText": "I have bought several of these. Very few HEPA air purifiers are usable for extended time periods in normal conditions on the high setting due to the noise level. These are the quietist I have been around on the high setting (@53 dB rated by company confirmed with measurement in house using NIOSH app on phone). Still obtrusive, but you can have a conversation. Think somewhat loud dishwasher. Some others are about 10 dB louder but without providing more effectiveness. On the middle and lower settings they are nearly silent, although they don't move as much air, but good for small groups or small rooms - it would be nice if the company provided CADR data for the lower settings. These are excellent for bedrooms and small to medium living rooms and family rooms. They are lightweight and easy to move around so can be moved to rooms with an immediate need. We use them at home and in a classroom. I think they are a key reason why we have not had any transmission of Covid-19 in the house or classroom when an individual was known to be infected but nobody else caught it. OEM filters are expensive, but Fette and others provide after market filters at a substantial discount. In larger rooms, we use several of these instead of one large air purifier because you can clean zones of air in a room locally instead of drawing it to one central point and quickly reposition them in critical locations based on activities.",

                "reviewText": "My older air purifier (different manufacturer) had failed and, after a few months, I detected the air quality in the house was suffering. The Medify MA-25 was rated the best quality model of its size in an independent comparison I found online. While slightly more expensive than others of similar size, I chose this model because the quality of construction and cleaning effectiveness were rated the highest. After a few weeks, I am very satisfied with the performance of the unit, so much so that I went back and purchased a second unit for use in other rooms. Selection of fan speeds and shut-off timer are good, and work well. Removal of odours (e.g. cooking smells, pet smells) was also immediate due to the carbon filter. The room air seems \"fresher\" and allergic effects on sinuses have bee significantly reduced. I like the clean and compact design, and the ease of changing filters on each side of the unit. My only criticism is that the third (high) fan speed is fairly noisy if you remain in the room. At the second speed, the low noise is almost unnoticeable. I like the units very much and would recommend them for rooms of 1000 sq ft or less.My biggest criticism is of Amazon and its pricing. When I went to reorder the second unit, the price for the white model had increased by $80. So, I ordered the black model at the original price. One week after the black model arrived, the Amazon price for the black model had returned to its original level. That's not a big issue for me, although I would have ordered both units in white, by why the pricing trickery?",
