Regular Filter Replacement: Check and replace filters as recommended by the manufacturer. This ensures that the air purifier continues to function at its best and maintains efficient air purification. Keep it Clean: Regularly clean the exterior of the air purifier to prevent dust buildup, which can affect its performance. A clean unit operates more efficiently. Allow for Air Circulation: Ensure proper air circulation in the room. Avoid placing the mini air purifier in areas obstructed by furniture or curtains, as this can limit its ability to purify the air effectively.",

You do need to take the filter out before you start it up, the filters wrapped in plastic. And you will need an input for a USB-A connection. As far as it being quiet, it is fairly quiet but not as quiet as they say it is. If I remember right I think they said it's about 22 decibels, which is absurd, because a quiet room is about 45 decibels. But even on high it's not very loud, I normally sleep with a fan on anyway so I like the noise. But it is pretty quiet. I just don't know what you're supposed to do with it once the filter gets bad. There does not seem to be a replacement filter for it anywhere. The filter itself is 5 in by 4 and 1/2 in by inch and 3/8. I guess considering the price once the filter plugs up you just throw it out and buy another? And it's also very light, it's just over 1 lb so it's quite easy to move around.",

Few things I wish were included: instruction on which way the filter should go in (not included on instructions nor the site) two different sides not sure which should go up or down, where to order replacement filters, and lastly a wall plug option not just USB option. I would have given 4 stars but since unsure if beyond the one filter use I will be able to use any longer since no replacement filter included nor where to order more filters plus unsure if I even have the filter in correctly due to lack of instructions on the instruction sheet. The air purifier works from what I can tell and sound is minimal. Great for a small space or near desk at work.",

                "reviewText": "This is a neat little air purifier that is the perfect size for a desk or nightstand. It works on a USB cable, making it easy to plug it instead of a phone charger. With one button, there's nothing to setup or fuss with, and it operates pretty quietly. You can barely notice it if you have another machine or PC running. It's hard to judge how much it cleans, but it must, and with air quality these days, getting some help with cleaner air helps peace of mind a lot.",

It was easy to set up, you just take the bag off the filter and replace it in the unit and then plug it in, you're good to go. There are 3 settings for how much air you want it to move. It does seem to clear the air well. Overall, it works well.",
