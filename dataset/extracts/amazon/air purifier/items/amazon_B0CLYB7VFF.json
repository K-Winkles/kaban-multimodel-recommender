                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars a good little (with an emphasis on *little*) air purifier",
                "reviewText": "I've got pretty bad environmental allergies (pollen, mold, dust, you name it...), and I've found that having an air purifier running in the bedroom at night can make all of the difference in how I feel for the rest of the day. The air purifier that I've had for the last several years isn't great (it's huge, and loud), so I decided to give this one a try.First off, I have to say that this air purifier is considerably smaller than I expected. Yeah, I get that it says \"mini,\" but I didn't expect it to be quite so mini. Of course if I'd read the size on the page I'd have had a better idea, but I didn't do that, I judged by the pictures. Particularly the one with the dog, that looks like a samoyed. These aren't generally small dogs, which would seem to indicate that the air filter sitting beside it is larger than it actually is. Either that's a very small samoyed or, well, someone used Photoshop and didn't worry about proportions. (EDIT: They seem to have removed the picture with the dog that I was referencing here. So there's that.)But anyway, maybe you want a particularly small air purifier, so that's not necessarily a bad thing. My biggest problem with it is that it doesn't say anywhere here on Amazon, or on the packaging, what size room it's rated for. The room that I'm using it in is fairly small, so I can hope that it's adequate, but it would be nice to actually know.All that said, I set it up in that room a few hours ago, and I do feel like I notice a difference in the air quality when I walk in there now. It does seem to be having at least some effect. Maybe not as much as my old larger (too large for the room, really) purifier, but at least it's not doing nothing.The air filter has four speed settings, labeled sleep (actually, a moon icon),1, 2, and 3. I can't honestly tell a big difference between sleep mode and mode 1, other than that it turns any lights on the unit off when it's in sleep mode, so they may or may not be the same. On that speed it's so quiet that you can't even hear it unless you get right up next to it. But air movement is also very minimal, so I'm not convinced it's really very effective. Mode 2 is a bit louder, but still tolerable. Mode 3 is louder still, but even it isn't as loud as my old purifier on its lower settings.One thing that concerns me is that as of this writing, I have no idea where I'd go to purchase a replacement filter. The company offers filters for several of its other models for sale, but I can't find filters for this one on Amazon or on the company's own site. It's a little bothersome. Hopefully they'll rectify that soon enough, but I honestly might be hesitant to purchase until they do.But, assuming they do eventually make the filters available -- if you've got a small room that you want to filter the air in, this is probably a good choice. If you have any doubts about the size of the room, though, you may want to go with something a bit larger. Hopefully the company updates their listings to say more about what to expect.",

So I have a vast, and very helpful, selection of air purifiers.Like the rooms and nooks and crannies in my houses, the air purifiers come in every size imaginable. This one is small, not intended for multiple rooms. I do not even recommend it for the 315 square feet the product page says it will cover, at least if you have the type of odor issues that I do. However, for an average sized bedroom, say 12 feet by 16 feet, it works like a charm. Definitely a good choice.",

It's great cause I have the purifier powered by my Wireless router, which is low voltage and therefore saves power.Its also very silent in the lowest settings, Since I have it pluged to my wireless router usb port it does not run on full power and that is quite alright, it still runs smoothly an quiet.",

                "reviewText": "I've really only used this for 2 things, soldering and 3d printing (PLA and PETG). It is small and compact, and not really loud, but when I'm using it soldering I see it suck the smoke up quickly and the room doesn't smell like I've been using solder. Obviously no smoke when 3d printing, but absolutely no smell at all. Game changer for soldering and 100% recommend this!!",
