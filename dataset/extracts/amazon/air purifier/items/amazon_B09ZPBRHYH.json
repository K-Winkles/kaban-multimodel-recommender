                "reviewText": "Got this to help with air purification in my car. I drive a small car that already has a good cabin air filter, but wanted a little extra. Once I received it, I got it out and set it up in my car. Within about 5 minutes I couldn't smell any of the outside smells (it was summer so there were plenty). it's a bit noisy if the stereo is turned all the way down but or my purposes it was fine.Where it really shines is on long drives. My commute is half an hour every day and I honestly think I'm breathing easier by the time I get home or get to work. Once when I was driving home I drove through a construction zone and wondered how it smelled. Yes weird but I noticed I wasn't smelling anything even through they were laying asphalt. So the next day I checked by cracking a window as I passed through the zone. Sure enough, hot oil smell.So the fact that it kept that smell down in my car is good enough for me. Having a pass through USB port just makes it that much handier.4 stars only because I'm not seeing nearly the same effect in my wife's SUV, but it's got a cabin almost 3 times the size of my car, and my car is probably sealed up better. So it struggles in a bigger vehicle, but I can still tell it's having an effect on odors.",

Considering the makers were chinese, I bow to you. This was made with the most respect and skill. I haven't seen anything from China made this well in a very long time.I advise the manufacturer to sue the fan manufacturer because that company that made the crap fans, destroyed an entire industry. You can not find these things anymore. Last year there were hundreds of these products by multiple manufacturers. They went out of business because of the company that produced the fans. The fans failed and it made the products look like they were junk. This was a product when I took it apart, looked like it was made by Sony back in the 1980's. Skill, quality and respect. I bow to you, I truly do. What you made is a masterpiece.Take that fan company to court and sue them.Old reviewI want a Negative Ion machine, I buy five different ones from five different companies and they all died within two months.This one from this company, I purchased one of these and received it on September 15th. Today is October 24 and its already dead.When you make a product, you don't make everything. You buy parts that are made by other companies. Table fan for example. Table fan company makes the fan, but they buy the switches, buttons, and motors from other companies that makes those things. It's not the fan companies fault if the buttons break or the motors are bad. (unless they keep using those faulty products by those cheap companies.)Back on track. Ive purchased six of these things this year by five different manufacturers. Including this unit by this company. All but one have broken and the exact same part failed on all of them. The little blower fan. This tells me that there is a company out there that is selling these Negative Ion companies really crappy fans. The sad part is that it is making the entire industry look bad. I want a Negative Ion maching, I buy five from five different companies and they all died within two months.Ive been reading a lot of reviews all over Amazon about products from multiple types of devices all having failures due to faulty tiny fans. So somethings going on.",

                "reviewText": "I bought it for my car because I don\u2019t like inhaling pollution, while I\u2019m driving. It makes such a huge difference.!!! The air is amazingly clean, and so easy to breathe! So I bought the same one for my bedroom and it works perfectly. In fact, I have another air purifier where I need to wash filters, and I\u2019ve noticed that since I\u2019m using this little device, my other air purifier never gets dirty at all! I used to wash it every month and it was dark water coming out of it. Since I started using this little device, my other filter is always clean, but I still use both just in case. I\u2019m going to buy another unit for my living room. I live next to construction in the building so I run air purifiers nonstop . so far this little device works perfectly for my car and for my bedroom. Such a difference in the quality of the air when I\u2019m running it. highly recommend.!",

                "reviewText": "So ive used an hepa air purifier for about a year, it does ... clean the air from odors, smoke and dust,But: this ionizer provides a 'out sidish' kind of airNot only the odors and smoke are gone, but you feel as if you opened a window even in a close days in your car or at your window less office... its amazing, and you dont have to spend money on filters for about 5 years!Whats not to like... that it have no batteries? But you still have the ability to charge your device via the usb port and you still can operate the product via power banks...impressive!At the few first minutes of use on a dirty air, it produces some noises... but nothing more than 3 minutes... nothing to be worried about.Edit: after several months the air purification IONs is too much and only if i open all 4 windows for 15 minutes, i start to smell the natural seat's leather and perfume.. Something is weird in the air its produces. Its feels like it's not gonna fade away soon from the environment. I'm stopping the use of it.",
