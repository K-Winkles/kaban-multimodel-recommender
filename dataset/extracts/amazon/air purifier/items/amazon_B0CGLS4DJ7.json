                "reviewText": "***UpdateIt worked fine for a week, then the top part stopped moving and it started making a horrific grinding noise so I shut it off and checked to make sure all the parts were still together tight, but no matter what it won't stop making that noise or start the fan moving again, and then it started shutting off if you had it on for more than 15-30 seconds. Which is too bad, because I liked the look of it and how easy it was to get the filter in and out of, etc.------------I needed an air purifier for a small room where I have my bench for working on electronics and other small projects in it, and the room doesn't have any windows in it so it can feel stuffy and/or smelly when I have been in there a lot on certain days during the summer, etc. Plus I needed something to filter out dust and other particles for when I am painting things by hand and want the surface to be nice and clean and smooth, and this is working out perfectly so far. There is a noticeable difference in the amount of dust that I am seeing building up on surfaces, even after just using it for a week.It was simple to set up and use and has plenty of handy features too. I wish it would have been black, but that is just a personal preference and not something that affects the way it works or anything other than not matching my other black stuff. lol",

It is limited to 1,2, or 3 hours timer run time or left to run non stop. The lights can be a little bright for the bedroom if you want complete darkness. My only complaint is that the filter is not designed to be cleaned and reused. And ordering filters from China for this machine is not desirable. I will do my best to clean the included filter or find a suitable substitute I can buy locally. That will not stop is from using this air filter as it works well.",
