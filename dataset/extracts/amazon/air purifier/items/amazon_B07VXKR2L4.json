It destroys over 100 more air pollutants than big HEPA air purifiers. New studies have found that indoor air is 10 times worse than outdoor air. There are hundreds of pollutants in indoor air that can cause serious illness and even death, especially black mold which puts deadly spores into the air we breathe. Mold also contributes to allergies and asthma. The EdenPURE OxiLeaf II Thunderstorm destroys black mold air pollution which has been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer and many other serious health problems that HEPAs do not destroy. Most homes have black mold air pollution which is mainly produced by air conditioner condensation. It also destroys over 100 harmful pollutants that other air purifiers do not. Old-style air purifiers such as HEPA filters and static air purifiers do not destroy over 100 dangerous pollutants. The EdenPURE OxiLeaf II Thunderstorm does destroy these dangerous pollutants through oxidation like a thunderstorm in the air and on surfaces. Old-style air purifiers require the air to be brought to the unit. But the worst air never comes to the unit. The compact EdenPURE OxiLeaf II Thunderstorm produces and sends out safe levels of ozone molecules, that attack all pollutants in every square inch of an area, including behind objects. These O3 molecules destroy up to 99.9% of air pollutants and turn them into harmless vapor and ash. No matter where the pollution is, it cannot hide from these super-oxygen cleaners, including surfaces. This super-oxygen cleaner, or safe ozone, is the way nature purifies the air. It is produced by the Sun and thunderstorms.",

The EdenPURE OxiLeaf II Thunderstorm produces activated oxygen, or ozone, which has a distinct smell and lets you know it's working. This smell may be irritating to some individuals with sensitive lungs. If you experience any issues, only turn on the OxiLeaf II Thunderstorm when you are NOT in the room and turn it off when you return. Before using the room again wait approximately 30 minutes for the activated oxygen smell to dissipate from the room. This will still give you the amazing benefits of clean, fresh air without any irritation.",

But out of 4 of them in two different homes, only one seemed to crap out after a week, and a second one seems a bit weak in performance. But this uncertainty should only be concerned at $20, not any product over $100.But one home has a serious mold problem and I walked in recently not coughing like a chainsmoker after using these devices, so I'm not sure if I can recommend or not. Some are saying they notice the smell but no cleaning result... Well, my experience is that the smell will fill the air first. When I come back hours later, sometimes the smell is there or not, but normally the air feels completely cleaned out and is easier to breathe.",

Super easy to opperate and its a very small little unit but it works well even in decent sized rooms.",
