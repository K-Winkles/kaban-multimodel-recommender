Therefore, it is ideal for large rooms such as living rooms or bedrooms, more depending on which room is based on necessity.It does aromatherapy and has a night light function so even at midnight you can still see where it is and it's still running. Plus, the purifier operates quietly and won't interfere with your night's sleep or your daytime reading. Three fan speeds can be selected according to your needs, and automatic mode means you don't have to always press a button to control it.Additionally, the four timer options are thoughtfully designed so you can set a timer without worrying about forgetting to turn it off and causing it to keep running.Although I can't see the allergenic ingredients with my own eyes. HEPA filters capture allergies, pet hair, smoke, pollen in the bedroom, providing air quality for healthier living and easier breathing.A good air purifier to improve air quality seems like a no-brainer to me.",

                "reviewText": "My home's living room needed an air purifier because I noticed an increase in dust and snow salt powder lately. I ordered this air purifier two weeks ago, and it has exceeded my expectations. I believe it's the best air purifier I've ever used, featuring many functions I hadn't seen before. The purifier has a display showing its operational status, including a PM2.5 level indicator in different colors representing air quality. With high purification efficiency, it can purify a space of 240 cubic meters within an hour, covering a large room of up to 1740 square feet. Placed in my living room, after about three hours, returning home felt like entering a new house with incredibly fresh air. What I enjoy most is its aromatherapy function, a feature I hadn't experienced before. While purifying the air, it releases a pleasant fragrance, filling the living room with aroma in about 30 minutes \u2013 far more effective than scented candles or diffusers. Our entire family appreciates it for allowing us to live in an environment that is both fresh and fragrant.",

                "reviewText": "The air quality in winter is always a concern, and how to improve indoor air quality is a question that every family must consider. Fortunately I have solved this problem very well. This air purifier uses H13 HEPA air filter, which can effectively filter dust, smoke, dog hair and pollen. A high-quality filter can purify an indoor area of 1740 sq ft. One filter is enough to purify the air in my entire apartment. Its control screen can display the detection value of PM 2.5, allowing me to try to understand the indoor air quality. Its working noise is very small, especially in sleep mode, it is only 15 decibels, which is almost negligible. Air purifiers are a must-have item in the home and play an important role in health that cannot be ignored. You won\u2019t be disappointed if you choose this air purifier, it\u2019s great value for money.",

First of all, it is excellent in filtering odors and particulate matter, which is especially suitable for my house(we have a cat and a dog). Pet hair and odors are much reduced in the air, creating a fresher indoor environment.I especially like it's aromatherapy function. By adding my favorite essential oils, the room is full of pleasant aromas. This not only improves the air quality, but also adds a pleasant atmosphere to my home environment.At the same time, its children's lock design brings me an extra sense of peace of mind. This design can not only prevent children's accidental operation, but also make me feel more at ease. Overall, this air purifier is nice addition for my family, providing us with fresh and safe indoor air. I'm satisfied with it!",

Concerned about the dryness caused by winter heating leading to itchy skin, I purchased the LUNINO H13 HEPA Air Filter. It features a PM 2.5 display air quality sensor, allows for the addition of fragrance, and has an aromatherapy function. This air purifier effectively removes dust, smoke, dander, pet hair, and pollen. It's easy to use with a simple plug-and-play setup, and I've placed it next to the exit aisles of several rooms. Since using it, my skin no longer feels itchy, and the discomfort is gone. Additionally, my nose no longer experiences frequent nighttime bleeding due to dryness. I am highly satisfied with its performance.",
