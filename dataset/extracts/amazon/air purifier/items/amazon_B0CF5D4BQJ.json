                "reviewText": "This air purifier is great! I put this upstairs in the hallway for my family and it seems to work nicely. I've used sleep mode a few times and it's quiet, you almost don't hear it if you don't listen closely. I wouldn't recommend putting this inside your room and closing the doors though, because it did make my throat a bit dry. It isn't a big problem and can easily be avoided if you open the doors. I also liked the smart features which can automatically detect and adjust fan speed according to air quality. The air quality indications are another plus as they tell you how bad the air currently is. It also clears cooking odors quite well, which is a plus as I cook quite often.",
