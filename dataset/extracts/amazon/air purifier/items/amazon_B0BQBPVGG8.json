I cooked bacon one day and it got a little smoky so I turned this baby on high opened a window and within 2 hours you could barely smell the after effects. It did in two hours what would normally take three days to do. Not to mention I leave it on low daily and I feel like the air is so much cleaner in my house. I don\u2019t see any particles /dust in the rays of sunlight shining in like I always did before. Love this! Buy it you won\u2019t regret it.",

The intuitive controls and clear instructions make it user-friendly, even for those who are not tech-savvy.Overall, the this has been a great addition to my home.

The purifier itself is an amazing product it is very well built it is pretty quite can be alittle loud if you have it on full blast. The filter actually traps all the cat hair inside I did not think that it would but it has more then enough power to do so and all you have to do is pop the cover off and clean off the filter. The app also keeps you notified on any maintenance the machine might need as well. All in all it is a super well built product and very user friendly.",

Super easy set up. Very small / slim size.I have other Govee products and have loved them. I\u2019m going to chalk up this bad air filter to a fluke and try again. Stay tuned for update.",

                "reviewText": "I got this on a discount, which made me finally try an air purifier, and turns out I really like it. My home includes a small cat, and two cannabis smokers. Oh, and a Mexican chef ;-). When you look into HEPA filters, you\u2019ll notice that the H 13 is considered medical grade and traps very fine particles. This is a model that you want over the 11 filter type. I also like the fact that this model uses a square filter, which should be easier to replace into the future, and the appliance itself is very lightweight, but moves air very quickly and quietly, and the built-in particulate sensor seems to operate well.",

                "reviewText": "I just want to say we have a lot of animals at our house. This thing takes the dander and hair out of the air and traps it in the filter. This is a godsend one of the best products I have seen and it helps eliminate the pet smell we have been using it for quite a while and I love how the outside felt piece of the filter is washable. There is a pet lock on there that you should definitely use because pets will turn it off. I love that it has a quiet mode as well. I can have it run while the children are sleeping. My life is better since I bought this product",
