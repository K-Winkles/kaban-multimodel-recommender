The sleek, modern design fits seamlessly into my home decor, and the built-in air quality monitor sets it apart from other purifiers.The real-time air quality display provides valuable insights into the pollutants present in the air, allowing me to monitor and adjust the purifier's settings accordingly. The HEPA filtration system effectively captures dust, allergens, and most importantly dog hair, resulting in a noticeable improvement in air quality.What impressed me the most is the purifier's adaptive mode, which automatically adjusts its fan speed based on the air quality data. This ensures that the air remains clean and fresh at all times, without the need for constant manual adjustments.Its super quiet allows me to enjoy purified air without any disruptive noise, and the programmable timer adds a layer of convenience to its usage. The filter replacement indicator is a helpful feature that ensures the purifier continues to perform optimally.After using this purifier for several months, I can confidently say that it has made a noticeable difference in the air quality within my home. I no longer have to worry about indoor air pollutants, thanks to this advanced air purifier.Blue air purifier has exceeded my expectations with its air quality monitoring capabilities and efficient purification technology.

Some rooms will go more than a year before they need filter replacement, other busier rooms around 9 months",

                "reviewText": "I needed to set up a filter in my home office once I started sharing it with a parakeet, and decided to go for this model, as offering a good combination of size, appearance, and functionality. I also splurged on the 411i (internet connected) just to try it out.I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying the connectivity. Not that I NEED to be able to adjust fan speed from a thousand miles away, but I could!! More importantly, this gives me the ability to program a schedule - lower fan speed when I'm working, higher in the evenings / weekends. It also lets me set intermediate fan speeds, e.g. 2.5 versus 3, or whatever.Noise: I have it set to 1 during the day, and I genuinely do not notice it unless I deliberately listen for it. When I'm in the office later, it is louder - but it's just white noise, so it's not bothersome. And my allergies do seem to be slightly better.HEPA filtration: The manufacturer uses the term HEPASilent, not true HEPA. Doing some further reading, this is because the unit's filter is NOT a true HEPA filter, which by itself traps 99.7% of particles of 0.3 microns (and supposedly, even more for larger or smaller particles). Instead, this unit combines a barrier filter with an electrostatic unit - presumably this is responsible for the low noise level and the energy efficiency. Having used true HEPA units in the pasts, the BlueAir unit is definitely quieter.Because of the electrostatic component, the device will emit a small amount of ozone. As it falls within all regulatory limits, including California's tough rules, this seems to be low enough that it is not worrisome. If you are particularly concerned over ozone, and/or plant to use this in a closed room without adequate ventilation, it's something to consider.A note on the filtration efficiency: BlueAir claims that their unit removes 99.7% of particles 0.1 microns in size - which would seem to be even better than the HEPA standard. However, since the HEPA standard says that they will likely trap MORE particles larger and smaller than 0.3 microns, it is certainly possible that the BlueAir doesn't work quite as well. I don't know if that's the case, and I suspect that for household uses, it would not make any difference for practical purposes - the difference would be trivial.",

I like too that I can control it via smart plug (on/off) and do routine, contrary to my old serie 500/600 that has remote control and it is impossible (Attention: i love my old 500/600 that I have for many years and I am happy with). Hoping the quality has not changed with the time. It is quiet and I like the concept capturing circularly contamination and pushing clean air only vertically on top. All around fabric cover could be easily washing.I am concerned about the set point when it is in automatic mode. In 3 weeks of use, I never saw changing from automatic mode to hight speed clean air. I think the sensor are very bad contrary to serie 500/600 that easily detect smell, contamination and quickly pass from automatic mode to hight speed clean. That could be improved seriously.Finally , I saw purifier increase speed at higher level when the numbers on screen at PM2.5 reached higher that 36.Led light in front of device changes colour: 0-12 blue, 12-22 green, 22-32 yellow, higher than 33 red and speed increase.",
