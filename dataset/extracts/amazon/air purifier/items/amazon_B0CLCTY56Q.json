                "reviewText": "This air purifier has a powerful fan compared to others its same size. The airflow on the lowest level of the three is about the same as the max airflow of some other single-room air purifiers we have, and on the lowest setting it is very quiet, probably where they come up with the 24db sound power rating for this unit. On medium and especially on high you can hear the fan running and the air moving, but it is moving much, much more air than the other purifiers. I would say it will purify the air in a room much faster than other units because of this higher air flow.The filter is very easy to change and doesn't require any tools. The base of the until unlocks with a twist revealing the filter which can be removed by hand. It comes with a 110V 2-prong power supply plug instead of the USB connection that other room-sized purifiers have, and this may be the reason the fan motor is so much more powerful. It needs to be plugged in to work, as it does not contain a battery.The only complaint I have about it is the display on top, which is relatively straight-forward with an on/off button, a fan control button that cycles between the three fan speeds, and a timer control button that allows you to set the unit to go off after pre-set amounts of time. The issue is that when the unit is powered off, the power button light flashes, and flashes, and flashes to let you know the unit is plugged in and ready to go. When it is on, the power light is solid. I don't know why I need to have the power button flash when it is off. I find this very annoying when the unit is in a dark bedroom to have a light flashing all the time in the dark if it's not on. I ended up putting a piece of electrical tape over the LED light for the power so I can't see if flash. Other than that, it is a nice, very powerful little air purifier.",

I felt like a game my office a crisp clean refreshing feeling after it was done running. I'm pretty sensitive to machine noise and this really didn't bother me so I think it's a good product overall for what it does to filter dust or small pollen or whatever out of the airIt has its own filter that you'll have to get it from the manufacturer and hopefully they'll be around available when it's time to replace it. I would say that is the only risk of this product that might give one pause. Otherwise it's a solid product for the price.",

It's so gross to look at especially knowing that without using this machine we'd be breathing in all that extra crap in the air. Just makes my skin crawl thinking about it. I really can't wait to get my camera fixed so I could take pictures of the uglyness of dust and crap we breathe. Definitely worth every penny, highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This is a lovely little air purifier. I wanted to get an air purifier because my studio apartment has a lot of dust and dander. I had a cat staying in my apartment for the last 6 months, which left a lot of hairs. I also just like the idea of inhaling cleaner air. So, I got this air purifier to keep by my bed because I spend a lot of time working from home in bed and, of course, sleeping. I usually wake up feeling kind of groggy and congested, but found that I feel a bit less stuffed up since I started using this. The fan is powerful, yet quiet. I can keep this right next to my bed while sleeping and working without feeling disturbed by the noise from the fan. It is very easy to assemble and operate. When first setting it up, the power cord is actually located inside of the purifier, which can be opened by twisting the console. The filter then sits inside the console, and no further set up is required. I was able to operate this almost immediately without having to use any tools or instruction guides. For the price, this feels like a bargain. It comes with a HEPA filter and I think it even has an aroma infuser, which is a nice plus. This has been great dealing with the cat hairs and dust ever since the cat left. It doesn't really take up much space. Also, it automatically lets you know when the filter needs to be changed by having all the lights light up. Definitely recommend!",

The higher intake airflow the higher output. Filter is easy to change. It is a decent air purifier especially for the cost.",

                "reviewText": "This is great as a budget friendly option for a \"Small Room\" Air Purifier!!!So far, so good - I've been using it in our bedroom, which is pretty small, and its worked splendidly! The first day, after a few hours, I noticed NO SMELL in our room!! Which was pretty amazing as its an older home (70s) and after fixing a water leak we'd been struggling to get rid of this mild musty like smell coming from the window area. 4 days later, continuous use, and the smell is STILL GONE!! So it is most definitely working!!!It's pretty quiet, though there is a slight sound. It's similar to white noise to describe it best and personally find it soothing at night. I also LOVE that you can optionally use essential oils for added fragrance during use, or choose not to, which is pretty great.This will work best in small bedrooms, bathrooms, closets and RVs. For the cost, it is ABSOLUTELY worth it and I highly, highly recommend this purifier! It works great!9/10!! Thank you!",
