My room is pretty big. 13x13 square foot in dimension..after about 15 minutes most of my sinuses clear up and it helps filter the air pretty well. It is also very cheap for the size, definitely get what you pay for. Not perfect, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap option this one is great!

                "reviewText": "The air purifier is great for small spaces & barely takes up any space on a desk or table. My problem is that it's actually kind of loud. I was planning on using it at work, but my office is very quiet & I didn't want to disturb my co-workers so I took it back home. It does make a great white noise machine, but even then I put it far away from my bed so it wouldn't be so loud. I'm not sure how well it actually filters the air since it is so small. The filter came out easy to it would be easy to change when it comes time. Replacement filters were going for about $12.99 on Amazon. There's an option to run it without a light on or to run it with a light that changes colors gradually from yellow to orange, to red, purple, etc. It came with a decently long charging cord. The part that connects to the machine is USB-C & the other end is USB so it can be plugged into a computer or a charging block. When I took it out of the box there was a small rattling noise coming from inside so there is something loose in there which is a little concerning. But the machine turns on & makes noise so I guess it's working.",

                "reviewText": "KIKI Pure A1 is a mini HEPA filter air cleaning device made for travel ideally. Powered by USB-C which a cable is included, the small size of this purifier makes it easy to discreetly set up in an office, nursery, RV, or anywhere a space needs some air scrubbing. The small space effectiveness of this air purifier is really obvious after about an hour, odors both new or lingering begin to fade away. The device does have a somewhat annoying color change pattern which might be appealing to some (but can be turned off easily) and a wall plug for the USB-C isnt included. The reduced noise level output is minor, and blends in to the background similar to white noise. All together, if you are looking to freshen the air in a small space and dont want to spend a fortune, grab one of these from KIKI Pure.",
