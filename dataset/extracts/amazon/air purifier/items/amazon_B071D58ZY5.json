        "description": "Levoit air purifiers avoid using UV-C light, an air cleaning method that research has shown can produce harmful ozone and secondary pollution. Please follow the details and FAQs below.Q: How safe are UV purifiers?The biggest issue with UV purifiers is that they emit varying levels of ozone. Even very small amounts of ozone in the air may result in chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, and throat irritation. In fact, The World HealthOrganization (WHO) has issued a warning against people using UV light to sterilize their hands or any other part of their skin.Q: How effective are UV purifiers?Not very. Microbes have to spend some time in front of the UV light before they\u2019re destroyed. The EPA explains that microbes must be exposed to the light \u201con the order of minutes and hours rather than the few seconds typical of most UVGI air cleaners\".",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this little thing! I live in a very humid & wet climate so I have a lot of trouble with mold and pollen which wreaks havoc on my sinuses. A friend suggested an air purifier so I came to Amazon for one. Based on a lot of positive reviews, I ordered this one and I have been SO pleased. It was incredibly easy to set up which was a plus. It has 3 fan speeds which I love, the lowest speed is barely audible but I have been using it on the the highest speed and it is great white noise for sleeping. I also LOVE that you can turn all of the lights OFF on the unit. They are bright at night but a simple click turns them off and then it is no issue. I also love the sleek look of it- not that that matters but it\u2019s a nice bonus! Most importantly, it really works! I have been using it every night for over a month now and my sleep quality has improved drastically. I used to wake up with sinus headaches and a terribly scratchy throat most mornings and I have not had this issue once since I\u2019ve started using this. I have also noticed that the air in my room smells super clean now that I use this purifier, something I hadn\u2019t even noticed was an issue before! It is the perfect size for my bedroom, which is only about 10x12 - gets the job done perfectly and then tucks away nicely into a corner when not in use. There are some super pricey purifiers on the market but this was an excellent find and now that I\u2019ve used it a while, I think the price point is excellent for the output. I highly highly recommend this little purifier!",

                "reviewText": "HIGHLY recommend this purifier!I bought this for use in a 10x12 room and it works perfectly. I bought it directly from LEVOIT after buying 2 lovely pink Himalayan salt lamps, which made me fall in love with the brand. Both lamps and this purifier seem to be made extremely well. They have great, simple designs and my mom and I both still love our lamps too. I think I've had the purifier for about 2 years now.We have a bunny in the 10x12 room/office, and the hay \"dust\" kicks up our allergies, so this purifier steps up in between vacuuming to filter the air, BEAUTIFULLY. I'm also a medical marijuana user and it even works when I move this around to different (larger) rooms temporarily when I'm vaping.The sound is very soothing and the 3 fan levels are great for different noise-cancelling options - 3 to drown out louder noises outside like mild/moderate rain storms, and 1 is great for a nice, quiet white noise effect for sleeping. If I need to clean the air in the room, I set it to 3 and let it run for 30 mins to an hour for maximum effect, but it improves the air pretty quickly even on 1 or 2. The sound is really soothing and I have great hearing so I'm pretty picky about sounds.The filters are easy to replace and pretty cost-effective. It's also very easy for me to flip over the purifier and take a peek at the filter to see if it needs to be changed. I also clean the foam filter at least once a week. (Not sure if that's recommended, but it's been working!)We'll be buying a larger LEVOIT purifier for the living room next! Great products!",

                "reviewText": "2nd EDIT: August 17, 2019. LEVOIT noticed from my original review that I was not completely satisfied with this product because it was sometimes noisy. Almost 2 years after my original purchase they contacted me through Amazon messaging and informed me that their engineers continually work to improve their products and they were going to send me the latest version of this air purifier for no charge. The new unit arrived a few days later. It is absolutely quiet, works perfectly, and I am completely satisfied with it. I am impressed by their diligence and I highly recommend this product and this company.EDIT: May 6, 2019. The unit made a distracting grinding noise for many months. I would kick it or bang on it and the squeaking grinding sound would go away temporarily, but would return minutes or hours later. One day a couple months ago I got so frustrated with it that I slammed the thing down repeatedly on the floor on its side. I doubt the manufacturer would recommend this. But it fixed the noise problem. It has run silently since then for the past few months. I have it on 24/7. I changed my rating from one to three stars.ORIGINAL REVIEWI loved it for the first week while it was quiet. Little by little it began to squeak. Now after about 10 days of use it's howling loudly on all fan speeds. There is a big construction project happening next door to my house with loud power saws etc. From where I sit, this Levoit is much louder than all of that construction noise. I can gently tap the side or top of the unit and the annoying squealing will go away temporarily. But then it starts howling again after a minute or two. I had to get up in the middle of the night last night to shut it off because it woke me. If the manufacturer or a customer can advise me how I might adjust it to eliminate the squealing noise, I'd love to keep this thing because the air purifying function seems to work very well. Otherwise, this product gets a big thumbs-down from me. I wanted two things from this unit: I wanted it to keep my indoor air quality safe during the Thomas Fire in the Santa Barbara area, and I wanted it to do so quietly. I'm sad this product can't do that. FAiL!",

It\u2019s gotten noisier since I got it even with cleaning and replacing the filter.It keeps the air quality pretty good but when the air quality gets really bad (trickles from other parts of the house or outdoors), I think it struggles to keep up a bit.Definitely good for the price though.",

I set it up in the main floor, and it is doing such a great job cleaning the air in this large space. I can breathe much easier and notice less dust in the room. I also notice it is whisper quiet, even on the highest speed. I will be moving this one to the bedroom and have ordered a second larger room unit for the main floor.",
