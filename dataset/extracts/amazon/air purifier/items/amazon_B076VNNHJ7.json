                "reviewText": "Very happy with the product and service.The Service: The first one we received only worked for a couple of days. I didn't worry about it because I had actually met the owners of the company at a convention a few weeks prior and I knew they were a company of integrity. So when my filter stopped working I simply emailed them and told them what's going on. That same day they emailed me the things I needed to ship the product back. I was back working in just a couple of days with the new one. I understand that there are going to be some duds when manufacturing electronic equipment so again, I didn't worry about it, especially since they have a 3 year warranty. They stand behind their products.The product: It's amazing how this can detect the air quality. When we cook bacon the unit will register low air quality and start blowing at high speed (this is if you choose to set it on automatic). I love the UV light and sonic feature. Even though you can't \"see\" anything that it is doing, I know the air quality is better because I know what UV lights can do. As a side note, we bought one of the UV lights for our HVAC system and within in a few days noticed a HUGE difference!! I know the UV light on this unit isn't as big as the one in our HVAC but I'm sure it is really helping with the air quality. It's quite on the low speeds (you can barely hear it on level 1) and gets louder as the unit blows faster. It can seem noisy on top speed but you can still have a normal conversation with it at that level. So, I highly recommend this unit.",

                "reviewText": "This air filter is awesome! The fan is a little loud when it reaches speeds 4 and 5 as other people have mentioned and it it's not as fancy as some of the other purifiers on Amazon but for me functionality is more important. I'm a smoker and every time I light a cigarette it will detect the smoke from across the room and springs into action cleaning the air, then gradually slows back down as the air gets cleaner. There is a meter measuring the air quality and if your curious what the numbers means, Google AQI (air quality index). I have attached a chart I found online to share.I read the reviews before buying and noticed people talking about how it doesn't detect things like \"cat poop\" and I thought I should clear that up for future shoppers. As far as I can tell from using this purifier and reading about air quality online it doesn't detect smells, it detects pollutants that can creat smells. This thing doesn't even like some air fresheners and will clean them out of the air, which I thought was funny.If you smoke, cook, paint or do anything inside that creates fumes or questionable air quality I highly recommend this unit. I tried a couple different ones (in this price range) before Oderstop, but they didn't measure up when it came to keeping the air clean!",

My vent hood isn't worth a good *** **mn, so when we cook, food hangs in the house. So I read the reviews and bought 2 of these things in hopes of managing this issue.I run them all day and nothing changes, the air may appear to be clearer, but cooking food smell still hang around no matter how long you run them. Just beware that the odor part may not work for you, it didn't for me.",

We\u2019ve noticed the air quality rating fluctuate with cooking, so it seems reasonably sensitive. The Amazon price was comparable to Lowe\u2019s but I could get it much faster via Amazon. Overall, happy with my purchase and would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "You can\u2019t beat this for the price given all of the features it has. I replaced a Honeywell with this one and moved the Honeywell to my office at work. It\u2019s incredibly light and the filter is very easy to take out and either vacuum out with a brush attachment or take it to your shop and blow out. I don\u2019t see any reason why the filter wouldn\u2019t last indefinitely. New ones are kind of expensive, so I hope so.The coolest features for me are the UV light and all of the information it gives you, like filter life. You can also turn the bright lights off if you use it when you sleep as I do. This little thing is well worth the money. Great value.",

                "reviewText": "Seems to be working pretty well but not for 1000 sq feet as advertised. The Manual says it is rated at CADR of 160 m3/hr [thats a Cubic Meter per Hour rating]. If you go to a web calculator for CADR and put in 1000 sq ft with 8ft high ceilings and at only 1 full exchange per hour it says you need a cubic meter per hour rating of 226 m3/h. So this unit will not do 1000 sq ft in 1 hour. It falls short of that. Based on that it is more suited for 700 sq feet, and again that is only 1 total air exchange per hour. That is not a lot. If you are talking multiroom areas you would need multiple units also. Bottom line is, I suppose you could put any number of sq ft on any unit's box as it will eventually cycle through but it's more about how many times an hour it can do this. Based on this, this unit is over priced.",
