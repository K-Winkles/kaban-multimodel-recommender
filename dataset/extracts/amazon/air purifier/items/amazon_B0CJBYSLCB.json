                "reviewText": "I recently moved and wanted an air purifier for the guest room and this one works pretty well. The first thing I will say about this is that the air purifier is that it is fairly small size. It is great for smaller rooms but definitely nothing like living room size. This also worked great for my resin printing area when I need it. The air purifier does a good job and this really gave me peace of mind. I no longer have bad air or the smell from say my resin printer. I did use this as well in my kitchen once and it does a good job with removing most of the cooking smell which is great. For the most part, I do enjoy having this device in my house and the compact size makes it great for moving around as needed. This is a very good air purifier to have and it is very quiet on the first setting but it can be noticeable on max setting. It does have a very simple LED light system to show that the device is one. The LED light can be a bit bright but not distracting. I get around this by just turning the led light towards the wall. This smaller size air purifier will not take up too much amount of space. It does a great job with giving you less bad air in smaller areas. Obviously this is not something I would put in my living room. It really does a good job with getting rid of the smell in the house if you happen to be cooking. I would be cooking and I turn this on before I go to bed and it gets rid of the smell over night. The controls for the most part are very simple as it is just a button press to turn on. It has very few fan functions. The filter is fairly easy to change and clean out as needed. It does not run hot or anything. The sound on this is very hard to notice when on the lower setting. Even at the highest setting the fan noise just becomes white noise for me. One thing to note is that all the cables are inside the air filter when you first open this. You have to remove the plastic film around the filter anyways so you should find that when you try to find the power cable. Overall this air filter is a good product if you keep it maintained. That means that you need to change the filter and vacuum the fans every month. If you do not it is not being run at the optimum efficiency. The white plating is also prone to yellowing if you happen to leave this in the sun. Part of my filter is actually yellow because of the sun light hitting the corner. It is easy to setup and easy to use for the most part. It is not very loud so you do not have to worry about it being distracting. It is a very compact air purifier so great or small rooms.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this air purifier for our bedroom during smoke season in central Washington state. We've been running it full time for the past two months, and it's made a noticeable difference for my boyfriend, who has acute COPD and emphysema. He said it's definitely helped make our bedroom a safe haven from the smoky weather. I think it's a little noisy, but it's a white noise, so very easy to fall asleep to. It works pretty well where it's locate and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs a budget purifier for a medium size room. Though we haven't had to replace the filter yet, installing the filter was a cinch through the bottom. Very easy to operate.",

                "reviewText": "I like this product a lot. Only issue I had with it was the light was blinking red after four months of use. I had a similar fan do that to me and I had to throw it out. I took the filter out and cleaned it, and then put it back back in and held down the power button until it blinked pink instead of red. Then I held it down again and the white light returned and was pulsing and the fan running idle the whole time. After giving it a few minutes I put it on full blast and it is back to working. I use it every day which is probably not what the manufacturers planned on, so the red light incident might be because it\u2019s already got a lot mileage. Use it intentionally, and if it blinks red while idling try what I did, hope it helps. Other than that, great product for the price.",

I sought after a decent air purifier for a single room, on a budget. A fan and motor inside funneled air through a mesh grate, which got the job done, pulling the source of the smell out of the air and into the filter. The quietest mode works fine, and I can hardly hear it. Also, their customer service is responsive and kind. Highly recommend for the price!",

So far, it's working perfectly for both of those things! I can definitely tell a HUGE difference when I walk into his office now, if he's been running this for a while (even on low). He sometimes adds a few drops of lavender essential oil to the \"oil pad\" in there, which adds a very nice but very subtle scent -- not too strong. I am VERY happy that I ordered this little machine and am thinking about getting one for my son's room as well. I'm also a bit jealous because I have a much larger air purifier by a different brand in my office that doesn't allow me to add essential oils, and I wish it did. I think it would be nice to add eucalyptus oil when you have a bad cold, too.",
