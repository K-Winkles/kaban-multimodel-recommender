                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice working air purifier with lots of features. Nice!",
                "reviewText": "I have been wanting to replace my older model of room filter/purifier for quite a while.The VEWIOR Air Purifier with Air Quality Display so far has been a great choice.Upon receiving it I found the air purifier was packed well and compactly, in a nice-quality box. Inside the box, there is the purifier and nothing else visible except the small manual, secured with packing foam. The manual gives you a quick overview of how to unpack the purifier and how to use it.The bottom of the purifier has a hatch that unscrews to get to the rest of the parts. Inside is the power pack, and the filter in its plastic protective bag.The filter fits into the bottom and the hatch goes back on. Replacing the filter is super-easy and quick.The power supply is a standard-looking transformer that plugs (non-polarized) into a 110-volt wall outlet, with a nice long fairly thin cord (carrying only about 5 watts at 12 volts - pretty standard stuff and low voltage) that allows you to position the air purifier a good distance away from a wall outlet and snake it to where you need it. On the cord is a warning about not using the air purifier in extreme conditions and on the other side of the tag is the VEWIOR customer service info.The whole unit itself weighs only about 2.82 pounds or 1.28 kg and measures about 6.30x6.3x9.96 inches. So pretty light, and fits almost anywhere.So that's all there is to setting it up, outside of finding a suitable place to place it.Air is drawn in from the sides of the lower half (so you don't want to block the sides) and blown out the top. Even with the fan at high speed, there's not a huge amount of air movement so if you don't like it to move your curtains or something like that it shouldn't be an issue.The small control panel on the front is straightforward with a display across the top and flat-panel buttons underneath.The top-left button is the manual fan speed, there are three fan speeds.The top-right is the timer button, which allows you to set timer periods from 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours to shut it off after that period. If no timer is used it stays on indefinitely, of course.The bottom-right is the power button - which of course turns the whole thing on. Turning on the power sets it to auto mode, automatically.And the bottom-left button is the automatic option, which as I mentioned above the purifier defaults to.If you manually have set the fan speed then pressing this AUTO button switches back to the automatic settings. With the automatic setting turned on it will adjust the fan (and thus the filtering performance) according to pollutant conditions in your room.In my home office as well as the rest of the house the air seems to be pretty good and the fan settles down to its lowest setting after about 20 or so seconds after turning the power on.You'll hear the fan run at an intermediate speed for a bit until the sensor analyzes the air in your room and sets the fan speed automatically. A quick informal test of this showed that it works quite quickly to detect changes in the room pollutants, upping the speed to filter the contaminants out.The display is bright enough to see in a bright room and the buttons also illuminate. After a short time both the display and the button backlights turn off, for power saving but the air purifier chugs along fine. Pressing any buttons turns the display and button backlights back on.The display itself shows the particulate level in the room, fan speed, and if there is any timer on.In my home, the particular display; the PM2.5 display, shows about 11-15 \u00b5g/mg. I assumed that was pretty clean because the fan speed immediately drops down to the lowest setting but I did have to educate myself a bit about this display and what the numbers mean. You'll find a lot of references on the Internet.So the display is showing a pretty safe reading for my home.This VEWIOR Air Purifier uses a three-stage system of filters consisting of a pre-filter, an H13 HEPA filter, and an activated carbon filter. Each stage in turn does specific filtering, from cleaning pet hair and dander first to removing 99.97% of particles down to .2 microns like pollen and smoke, and then purifying against benzene, VOC's, and other pollutants of that type. Air pollution of any kind is filtered, including from wildfires and cigarette smoke. It even traps odors in the activated carbon filter.It's made for what I consider a normal-sized room, about 600 square feet or 56 square meters, according to the specs.It has three fan speeds so I am guessing that if you had to clean a somewhat larger space cranking up the fan speed might eventually clean a larger area.But ideally, you might keep to the room size recommendation as the fan movement tries to clean the entire volume of air in a 600-square-foot room five times an hour. Using it in a larger space likely is going to decrease this number and effectiveness. But likely would be better than nothing!The lowest fan speed is pretty quiet, producing a gentle white noise - about 18 dB, while the two higher fan speeds each are proportionally higher in volume but not appreciably. You could even use this unit as a white noise generator while working or sleeping if you needed to. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the lowest setting is pretty quiet if noise does bother you.The VEWIOR Air Purifier also has a little door that can be opened in the center of the top, which has a little sponge sort of thing that you can drip a drop of essential oils fragrance in for aromatherapy or if you just want a nice scent in your room. Make sure you check on which fragrances and oils can negatively affect pets before using them - there are a number that are not safe nor good for pets, don't take any chances.The company recommends replacing the filter every 3-6 months. After looking at other air filtration systems similar to this it seems to be a pretty comparable price.So to sum up - so far I have been really happy with the performance and use of the VEWIOR Air Purifier and I have no complaints or anything negative I can say about it at this point, but will update this post if anything changes.The unit sure looks and feels high quality, as if it should cost a lot more, and is light and fits in almost any place I think. You'll barely notice it's there doing its job too. Highly recommend the VEWIOR Air Purifier.",

I bought this air purifier for our family room because it looked compact and attractive, and would fit in on obtrusively to any decor.But the main reason it\u2019s appears to me that the family room always does smell fresher when I walk in from the other rooms. The three level fans are excellent. You can\u2019t even hear when it\u2019s on level one and level three is not a big distraction.I like the PMI feature and also the timer that will turn it off one set for the right timeI\u2019d like this, so I bought another one for my bedroom for the very same featuresThere is a filter that suggested to be replaced every 3 to 6 months, so I\u2019m eager to see when it\u2019s time to replace if there\u2019s any significant difference in the color of the filter. There is a small absorbent pad in the top where you can add a fragment oils to give a light to the room. The price was excellent.",

I have 2 cats but I don\u2019t have allergies to them so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s making that better (pet dander) but what I can say is that at level 2 of the air flow it is great white noise for sleeping. And my cats were curious about it. Nice, compact, and as far as I can tell, it does the job. Air was already pretty clean as it is since I don\u2019t smoke inside or anything like that, but I\u2019m assuming since it\u2019s on, it\u2019s doing the work.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This seems to flow air well, very quiet and easy to use. Touch buttons seem a bit firmer than a touch, and I\u2019m not sure I completely trust this. As video shows it consistently flows between the same numbers and hasn\u2019t ever changed otherwise. I\u2019m contemplating finding something I can fully have faith in. Also the size is good, but it\u2019s honestly feeling more trust worthy in my small bedroom vs living and kitchen area (260 square feet), as I have two of these (one was a gift). May update in a couple of weeks when I check filter. Overall, purchase for a small bedroom seems likely again, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really cleaning the air, certainly doesn\u2019t help cooking odors.Update about a month later: no change in the way it works, small amount of dust on filter, oil scent put out is good when used, high setting is loud, sleep setting is perfect, as is level 1, with 2 nearly as loud as setting 3- high. Doesn\u2019t help clear air smell of cooking in anway. Overall still don\u2019t trust the things. I used nail polish beside one and it detected up to 50s and slow count down back to the same rage as it flows stead through daily. Used nail polish beside and it didn\u2019t detect anything. It puts off a small cold air near the area where the purifier sits. I\u2019ve only kept these for the actual quality of design and dust factor in a small apartment. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for anyone truly concerned with air quality and also not for large areas. Over pretty disappointed because we had a mold concern and this doesn\u2019t cut it for that reason. Clorox has a purifier I\u2019m already trusting and interested in buying.",

The PM2.5 Display starts at 500 ug/m3 and starts counting down ...then flashes 12 , 18 , 20 , 10 and like clockwork Back to 500 and the process begins again ...OVER and OVER and OVER The reason I gave it a three ........is BECAUSE it seems to be working as a AIR Purifier ... which is what it really is ... all the added accessories that they added to help the selling point do not work (or Exist). If the Air Quality Monitor is so sensitive that it breaks with normal deliveries and normal household Usage then it is obviously a very POOR set up to begin with.",
