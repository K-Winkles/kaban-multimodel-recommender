It\u2019s pretty much silent, has nice color selection, and the modes are nice for heavy/strong cooking and using potent cleaning products. Works great!",

                "reviewText": "Happy with unit and it does move more air than another model unit that I had. Can't complain about it so far and easy to setup. Multiple light color choices are just an added benefit. Strangely I would have liked the sleep mode to have the option for the light to use as a nightlight but light only works in Hi and Med. modes the light is shut off for Sleep mode. That is my only nit with it. Overall a great value and on Sleep and Med. fan noise is very acceptable. In Hi mode fan is supersonic :) and I don't use that mode. Looks like a well built product time will tell.",

I could never sleep right because I was always laying down with a stuffy nose and couldn\u2019t breathe. This had gone on for as long as I can remember and Ive had my animals for at least 6 years now. I seriously couldn't take it anymore. Here i was, at 4am - looking at air purifiers. I noticed a difference within the first day and that I can actually breathe in my own home. Not to mention there is no more lingering odors now from trash and other things like the litter box. Now I need to get a second one for the bedroom because right now I have been moving it in there when i go to bed.",
