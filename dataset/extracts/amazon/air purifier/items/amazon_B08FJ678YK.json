        "description": "Levoit air purifiers avoid using UV-C light, an air cleaning method that research has shown can produce harmful ozone and secondary pollution. Please follow the details and FAQs below.Q: How safe are UV purifiers?The biggest issue with UV purifiers is that they emit varying levels of ozone. Even very small amounts of ozone in the air may result in chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, and throat irritation. In fact, The World HealthOrganization (WHO) has issued a warning against people using UV light to sterilize their hands or any other part of their skin.Q: How effective are UV purifiers?Not very. Microbes have to spend some time in front of the UV light before they\u2019re destroyed. The EPA explains that microbes must be exposed to the light \u201con the order of minutes and hours rather than the few seconds typical of most UVGI air cleaners\u201d.",

                "reviewText": "I had this out of the box and working within a few minutes. The instruction manual is clear and the controls on the air purifier are clear and easy to use. It looks nice and has a clean look to it. Note: The instruction book says it should be situated 15 inches from anything (like a wall) on all sides. I didn't see that anywhere in the listing and I had planned on setting it in a corner so I had to rethink its placement a bit. It's probably more of an efficiency thing than an absolute as the intake for the air is all around the lower part of the unit and the air exits out the top but you will need to give it space to work effectively. The same company makes non-round units that can probably sit next to a wall if this setup doesn't work for you.There are three fan settings. On the lowest, it is peaceful and quiet. It's not silent, but like a very soft white noise machine. I get bothered by noise and this doesn't bother me. The highest setting is somewhat loud but the great thing is, you can set the timer on it and just have it do the high setting for a short time (like two hours) to get the room air circulating and cleaner. Then it can cut back to the quiet level.I used a very simple sound meter on my phone to measure volume and standing right next to the unit I got about 34 dB (decibels) at low level fan, 44 dB at medium level, and 54 dB at high level. For reference, a whisper is about 30 db and an average conversation is about 60 dB unless you are particularly expressive.Overall I'm happy with it and it has received good reviews as a less expensive option that is still very effective. I'm using it for our second, small room which functions as an office...and as the kitty litter room. I can turn it on high when the kitties are visiting their bathroom in the morning and partying in the dust, and then turn it down for the day while we are working and it's a soothing low level background sound. I have two litter boxes so we'll see how it does over the next couple of months but so far I am very happy. It really does look nice in the space and will make the air healthier for all of us.",

I also purchased the 300 for my kitchen and dining room and I am glad that I purchased the 200 for my living room because it is smaller and quieter than the 300. The only feature that the 300 has that the 200 doesn't have that I wish it had is the automatic mode. In the automatic mode, the 300 automatically cuts on and shuts off based on the quaity of the air in the room that it senses. This is an energy saver and a filter saver. To compensate for the 200 not having the automatic mode, I simply set it on the timer feature to clean the air in the room without wasting electricity or filter life.",

                "reviewText": "This air purifier is amazing, and has definitely set a high bar for what an air purifier should be.One of the awesome features of this air purifier is how quiet it is. I barely notice it's on, even when it's running on its highest setting. This is amazing for me, cause I use it in my room at night. It's just a really quiet whir that helps me sleep. It has a \"sleep mode\", but honestly the low setting is quiet enough. If you're really sensitive though, sleep mode is barely audible.I've also noticed a huge improvement in my allergies since I started using this air purifier. I live in Texas, and I swear the outdoors is trying to kill me through my allergies. I've definitely noticed an improvement in my symptoms (take that, Oak trees!!).Another feature I really like is the fact that I can control the purifier with Google Home. This makes it super easy to turn on and off, and change the intensity without even getting out of bed. I will say, sometimes it disconnects itself from the levoit app. I'm not sure why. Luckily it's simple and fast to reconnect it.The filter has lasted a really long time, too. I bought the purifier in September, and the app says I still have about 14% left. Paying ~$25 for a filter every six months isn't too bad!!Finally, don't mention this to my girlfriend, but she farts a lot. She has IBS, and the mornings can get stinky. Well. They used to. Now, I don't have to hold my breath for a few moments every once in a while. That saves me my nose, and her from getting offended!!Overall, I highly recommend this air purifier. It's quiet, effective, and easy to use, and I definitely think it's worth the price. This is the first air purifier I've bought and it has definitely set a high bar for what an air purifier should be. I'm definitely not going to go back to a purifier-less life, and once I can afford another, I'll definitely buy one by Levoit for the living room.",

                "reviewText": "It's a good product, I don't think I personally saw too much change in air quality so either that means my air is already fine or too bad to notice \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f like that it worked with Alexa though I kept it on more often than not so didn't use that feature much, but setting it up to do it was fine. If I was to purchase again I would search for one with a reusable filter because replacements are $26 which just seems excessive if replacing every 6 or so months and having to just add that to the list of things to buy. It does make a quiet fan noise that worked out well for low white noise though so plus for me.",

                "reviewText": "Es un producto que definitivamente recomendar\u00eda para habitaciones que suelen tener bastante acumulabilidad de polvo/contaminaci\u00f3n, y sobre todo quienes tienen mascotas que sueltan mucho pelaje (tengo un gato cruce dom\u00e9stico mexicano bastante lanudo). Si bien a una semana que llevo us\u00e1ndolo he notado una gran diferencia, ya no hay malos olores y el aire se siente tan... \u00bfligero?... ojo, no sustituye por completo el hecho de limpiar y/o cepillar a tu mascota.Estuve pendiente por algunos comentarios que le\u00ed del producto antes de comprarlo, as\u00ed que dar\u00e9 mis referencias conforme estuve usando el producto:- El bot\u00f3n de control para mascotas s\u00ed me funcion\u00f3, sin embargo a diferencia de los otros botones \u00e9ste lo tienes que mantener presionado para activar/desactivar.- El filtro tal cual es una sola pieza, bastante grueso donde aparenta tener las diferentes capas que el diagrama en el instructivo anuncia (no hay forma de \"desmontarlo\"). S\u00f3lo voy a decir que al menos en calidad del aire, olores y polvo se nota la diferencia y con eso estoy satisfecha.- Sobre el gasto de luz actualizar\u00e9 ya cuando llegue mi recibo (yo lo necesito mantener encendido todo el d\u00eda usando los distintos niveles, incluyendo de mode sleep).- En 1 semana not\u00e9 que por encima de los \"hoyitos\" comenz\u00f3 a acumular ligeramente el pelaje de mi gato que iba recolectando, s\u00f3lo es pasar de vez en cuando un trapito o toalla h\u00fameda y listo.- Sobre el ruido, la verdad es bastante obvio que a mayor velocidad del ventilador har\u00e1 mas ruido (y creo yo que cualquier dispositivo similar lo hace, es inevitable), a\u00fan as\u00ed es bastante tolerable, es s\u00f3lo el sonido del \"viento\" que hace m\u00e1s que el propio ventilador. Completamente distinto a una aspiradora, por ejemplo. El modo Sleep es silencioso, el nivel 1 normal solo se escucha ligeramente, y as\u00ed sucesivamente.",
