                "reviewText": "What a find. As a person that travels most of the year for work, this has been PERFECT!! I had a stay at an extended stay hotel that had severe odors all the time. I searched for a solution and found this. The design and look is really great and the ability to put drops of oil in is genius! The scent isn't overwhelming and the design makes it last for a long time. On high, the noise can be a bit louder than expected, but the noise is constant and actually relaxing while trying to sleep. The great part is that the fan speed can be adjusted while I am in my room for noise reduction and I can crank it up when I leave for the day. If you travel for work and spend time in hotels, or are looking for a smaller space, do not skip over. Hits the perfect spot of price, design and works great. My single suggestion is to make sure that you carefully order replacement filters as it is very easy to order the wrong ones like I did and get hit for the charge. My mistake, but read carefully.",

I haven\u2019t tried the essential oil function but I think that would be a great addition as I prefer it not to smell too outdoorsy fresh. It is really quiet and I love the touch button. I\u2019ve used it in my bedroom and kitchen, and feel comfortable moving to any section of a space I want to smell fresher. It helped freshen up cooking smells and the smoke from neighbors, and kept the bedroom air fresh for nighttime. I think it is a great product for the price especially for apartment living. It is quit small so you would probably want something bigger if you had a bigger space.",

It works really well in the bathroom especially with the essential oil sponge. It\u2019s not always very quiteTho. Noise level is noticeable. On two of them it is loud enough it takes my attention. The one in the bathroom is not noticeable with sound. This is after a few months of use.",

The small footprint allows it to be placed anywhere.The air purifier clears food and stale odors. The tech light blue accent light and three stage fan easily cleanses the room's air. On the lowest fan speed, the purifier is completely silent. I purchased a couple replacement filters for the future, since I plan to have this gadget for quite some time.",

                "reviewText": "Edit: they reached out to me and rectified the problem, so I am very happy with the customer service, and I can give it a positive rating and am satisifed that I bought it. Just be careful not to run it on high continously, or for too large of a room, but its decent quality and should do well on low/ish settings, and in a small space.This thing is cheap, but seems therefore...cheaply made. If you want to run it on high a lot, it does not seem to hold up, as it pretty quickly began making weird noises as it ran, after only a few weeks running it on high consistently. I upgraded to a better model (levoit) which is more than worth it. (Those last all the time on highest setting, and never make any squeaking noises....ever. these cheaper made units might only be useful when using more casually/only on low setting, but does not hold up well over time.)Also even after vacuuming the filter, the air coming out still smells bad, wheras larger purifiers you can vacuum filter + make it last longer. So it's another 10-15 bucks for a tiny filter, on a unit that makes noise, and doesnt last well. Just spend a little more money to get a levoit, which you can vacuum those filters and it evens out that way, for way better performance, and no noise.",
