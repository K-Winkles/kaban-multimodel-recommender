                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Love this product. It works as it should love the different settings. This two pack is perfect I have one in my office/cat room and the living room. I use the higher setting in the office area due to the cat litter and cat trees being in there and it works wonders. This is a must have if you're a pet owner. Completely takes away any pet smell that's in the room and reduces dander and dust. The two pack makes it convenient to place one in different parts of the house one can filter enough square footage for more than the room I'm using it in! Another feature I love about these compared to others is the color of the night light. Many other brands use that bright blue light but this one offers a warm orange color that's extremely comforting at night time. Gives a relaxing feel.",

                "reviewText": "The fact that you get two for the price is great but these really aren't that effective. They work okay but I wouldn't really say they eliminate smells/smoke/ect. I have one in a small bedroom and it works okayish. Helps with some pet smells but only kind of. The other is in my living room and it doesn't do much out there but it could be the size of the room. One also runs extremely loud vs the other. Both are set up correctly and are barely weeks old so they certainly shouldn't be making much of any sound. Personally, I'd just suggest you buy a better air purifier.",

I am a big fan of these air purifier units.They have a small footprint and can easily fit on a bedside table or on a corner stand in any room.As you will notice from the video, they are exceptionally quiet even on the highest setting, yet our powerful and moving a great amount of air. The ultra quiet fan technology is quite exceptional actually.The filters are easily replaceable and can be found on Amazon as well.It comes with a cord long enough for convenient placement next to an electrical outlet. I also like that it\u2019s designed with USBC as opposed to the older micro USB technology.It used to be well-made of high-quality materials and carries with good warranty and customer service support.Very reasonable value especially for a two pack of machines and I feel that I paid a fair price.I\u2019m very happy with this purchase and would purchase again",
