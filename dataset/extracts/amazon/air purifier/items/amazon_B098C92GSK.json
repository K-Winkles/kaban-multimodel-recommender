It has worked well and I like that you can choose auto settings to let the purifier determine when it needs to come on, or you can choose yourself to turn it on and off when you want.It seems to have really helped! Sleeping better! The LED reading on top will show what your current air quality is, when you need to change your filter, and you can choose to dim the panel display. The unit is quiet enough and doesn't disturb our sleep. Happy to have this!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 3 other purifiers before deciding on this one. One was a mini tabletop one that ended up just not having enough power, and the other 2 had a weird motor noise/rattle that I couldn\u2019t get past. I am sensitive to sounds so it was important I ended up with either a silent purifier or one where sound wasn\u2019t annoying.-The indicator works very well. If I cook or light a candle it senses it quickly and the fan turns up as needed.It is surprisingly good at filtering odors. This seems to be hit or miss with air purifiers. The filter has an activated carbon layer that does not look thick but seems to work. I have this next to a litter box cabinet and it does a good job at filtering out the odors. Granted I do a good a job at keeping it clean, but I do notice an improvement.-Finally, the noise. The low setting is pretty quiet. You can hear it in a quiet room but almost any competing sound will drown it out. I keep it in a 10x10 guest bedroom/office. In a quiet room it\u2019s a nice quiet white noise. The next level up just sounds like a little louder version of the white noise. It\u2019s a typical fan noise.For under $100 (for medium) it\u2019s tough to beat.",

                "reviewText": "This was supposed to be a NEW purchase of this air purifier. Evident that this was an open box return, absolutely NO documentation/manual/warranty information etc. The box was re-taped, and the bag over the unit was torn and not taped. The purifier/manufacturer box was placed in an Amazon shipping box over TWICE as large as the item box, with ABSOLUTELY NO PACKING/PROTECTION!! It was a major miracle the the item was delivered without any apparent damage, only damage to the outer box. AMAZON, BE BETTER THAN THIS!!! Your shipping people suck! Do not know if the unit functions normally, it did power up, but has not changed on auto run for over 2 hours so far. The unit is pretty quiet on the lower 2 (of 4) fan settings, when on Auto, it defaults to the lowest speed until the air quality sensors detect impurities and kick the speed up (or so I'm told). Will try to update this review with an actual performance review.Three week update:After all the reservations above, this air purifier has become one of our favorite appliances in our home.It quietly goes about its job, and does a great job cleaning our air!Last weekend we cooked hamburgers on our kitchen range, and the unit kicked up to speed 3, and the light changed from green to red (in the living room). After about an hour it started slowing down, and by the next morning it was back to low speed (on Auto). Food smell was gone. We even bought a desktop air quality monitor to check the reading on the unit, it tracked pretty closely! Review for the unit function and operation is now 5 stars! Might get one for the basement too.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this during wildfire season in BC. We also own some Medify air filtration units, but we bought this because it has an ion sensor and it is automatic.This system works GREAT! In automatic mode, its super quiet until the particle detector senses in increase. (like when we open the back door when its smoky or when we are frying something) As it senses more particles, it ramps up through various stages depending on how bad it is.Once the particle count does down, it ramps down again. (back to super quiet)Our other units are always on, and do not have sensors. So they burn through filters every three months. This only works when needed and once it's done its job, it gets quiet again. Saying that, its still not as loud as our MA-25 at high speed.So I definitely recommend this unit. Its keeping our air clean on our main floor (open plan) and it was very reasonably priced considering its firepower. The next time we need to buy filters for our other units, we may just buy another one of these instead.",
