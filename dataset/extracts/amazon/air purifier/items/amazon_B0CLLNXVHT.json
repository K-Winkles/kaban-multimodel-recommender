                "reviewText": "This is a four stage air purifier--being that it has a washable air filter, the HEPA filter, the charcoal filter, and the UV light filter. The charcoal filter is attached to the back of the HEPA filter as one unit. The true HEPA filter can remove 99.97% particles and the the charcoal filter assisting by also removing particles and odors.I wish I would have had this air purifier last year when we had all those wildfires up north. Hopefully I won't need it for that this year. The UV filter I personally could do without---as UV filters tend to create ozone and I also have hydroponics likely creating some ozone. That can actually worsen some asthma conditions. I have been using this at night without any issues. It did freshen the air and I had a better sleep.I liked the setting options, particularly the sleep and auto sensor. It has a timer and 3 fan settings, I usually used the fan at the lowest setting, as it runs quieter. This air purifier can check air particle information, which you can also manually check. I sort of wish it could have an ozone level check too.I liked the good cleaning information, but there wasn't any mention on changing or cleaning the charcoal filter. I'm assuming that would be part of the HEPA filter cleaning as one unit.All in all, with the environmental issues these days, its good to have a good air purifier around.",

                "reviewText": "The Aroeve air purifier was packaged for transit and arrived in excellent condition. A plastic bag protects the inner filter and must be removed before operating this appliance. Out of the box, this unit has a noticeably compact size, which makes it fit discreetly into most any room. Compared to other similar purifiers rated for approximately 1400 sq ft, the compact size makes this unit a more ideal fit. This air purifier has multiple functions controlled by the push button interface, including an automatic mode, which chooses a fan speed based on the detected air pollutants. So far \u2013 on the automatic mode - this unit has operated only on the low speed and is very quiet. The filter for this unit is multi-staged, including a washable screen for pet hair and bigger airborne debris \u2013 a feature I love because it helps to prolong the life of the inner filter. Another positive is the inside MK07 filter as it is easy to access and replace (and at an affordable cost). This purifier is mainly designed for removal of dust, allergens and pet dander \u2013 all of which it has seemed to perform very well at my house. The unit apparently is able to remove strong odors, but I haven\u2019t yet been able to assess this function, but the filtered air flowing from the top of the unit definitely smells clean. Highly recommend this unit for anyone needing to improve their inside air quality.",

                "reviewText": "I am so, so pleased with how well this air filter works. I have the smaller, one room version of the Aroeve filter, but this is such an upgrade. Here are the pros and cons...Pros:1. This isn't as big as I expected it to be. Sure, it's got some weight to it and it's noticeable in a room, but if you put it in a corner, you're not going to notice it.2. It has several different modes that include a sleep feature to ensure quiet operation. It doesn't run constantly unless you want it to. When it's on a quieter mode, you won't hear it. When it's on a louder mode, it's like a sound machine, although not overly loud. You can block it out pretty easily.3. It filters different size particles, and you get to choose what size it filters. There are three different options, which is nice, because it can be customized for your environment. I filter out dog and cat fur, along with some allergens native to my area. The room smells SO much cleaner and I haven't had to take an allergy pill since I've ran this thing.4. The filter is washable! You can spray it down in the kitchen sink or vacuum it when it's a little furry or dusty. It's useful up to 3000 hours, which is impressive.Cons:1. Honestly, none. It cleans my entire apartment twice in an hour, which is impressive. For a larger house, this is perfect. For an apartment, you'll never notice funky smells and allergens again.",

This compact unit really packs a punch when it comes to cleaning the air. It's 4-stage filtering technology assures every square inch of our air is cleaned to the max. Replacement HEPA filters are available on Amazon for around $30. The many features of this machine are amazing.
