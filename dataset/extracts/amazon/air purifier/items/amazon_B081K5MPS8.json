                "reviewText": "PROS:- I set the unit in a central area of the house between the living room and kitchen so that it can cover multiple areas. On auto setting, it kicked on very quickly to remove polluted air and any smoked from cooking.- After a few months of usage, I've noticed a considerable difference in the overall reduction of dust and my seasonal allergies have been noticeably reduced.CONS:- When the fan kicks on to maximum, the fan noise is noticeable. When operating under low or medium speeds, it's fairly quiet.- Smart app instructions included for troubleshooting were lacking. I couldn't get device to detect & connect to my WiFi. After doing some research on Reddit, I found that changing the router encryption setting from WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK to WPA2-PSK solved the problem.- May encounter issues when trying to sync Google Home with Mi Home app.TIPS:- I recommend buying disposable filter cloths to wrap around the unit's filter. It should prolong the life of the filter and keep it clean...and perhaps save you money in the long term. https://www.amazon.com/DHVIJA-Compatible-Anti-dust-Kimberley-Electrostatic/dp/B0BKLJK242/ref=sr_1_5?crid=9XTUY16470H8&keywords=xiaomi%2B3h%2Bair%2Bpurifier%2Bfilter&qid=1683256753&sprefix=xiaomi%2B3h%2Bair%2Bpurifier%2Bfilter%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-5&th=1",
