I have it in a room next to my kitchen and love how reactive it is when I\u2019m cooking. It immediately kicks on and measures the air quality totally removes the smell from pan frying.",

                "reviewText": "We have dogs, and I surely could have used this years ago, when we had FIVE. I bought so many little plug-in machines and spent so much on monthly filters for them, I could have bought a big bag of dog food per month with that money! Our older dogs are not with us anymore, so we have two. But if I don\u2019t vacuum every other day, I can see all the dog hair when the sun comes streaming through the glass door! How in the world? I am really, really hoping that this air purifier will cut down on that. PLUS, we live in the Texas Hill Country, which is NOTORIOUS for cedar fever this time of year! I was shocked when we moved up here and saw a coating of yellow, on cars that sat in place for a couple days! And you should see the YouTube videos what cedar trees look like when a helicopter lowers itself close enough: LITERAL CLOUDS of yellow, billowing upward! I am happy to have this Shark air purifier, and am looking forward to cleaner air inside the living room, where my husband spends most of his time. We are senior citizens, and I want us to stay as healthy as possible.First thing I saw was the \u201cquick start guide,\u201d which I immediately loved\u2014and it was not written in microscopic writing! Thank you, Shark! On the unit, I read the yellow strip, because I had to figure out how to unscrew the housing, and had to turn it upside down to remove the filter and take it out of its plastic. After reassembling, it was just a matter of plugging it in and turning it on. I decided to just put it on \u201cauto,\u201d because it said the machine sensed the air and adjusted accordingly. I like the indicator on the front, also, that tells you the current clean air quality in the room. Right now, it\u2019s pretty good, because I just vacuumed and mopped yesterday. Let\u2019s see what it does in a week. :) I recommend this, as there are so many things around us that we don\u2019t need to be breathing, ESPECIALLY indoors!\ud83d\udc4d",

I love the fact that you can just set it on auto mode, it monitors (and displayed) air quality, and increases and decreases speed automatically as needed BASED ON air quality. It's also much quieter than many of the air purifiers that I have used that are rated for 500 sq ft. At under $200, I would call this a good buy, as well. I really love it!",

                "reviewText": "This Shark air purifier is quieter than my TRUSENS or Holmes brands that I have. This is the easiest to exchange the air filter also. To replace the filter, you just unscrew the bottom of the unit. The filter easily slides into the frame. I like also that I can buy aftermarket filters at a much more reasonable cost which saves money. Filters are where companies make money. The controls are easy to operate. I like how large the display is for reading air quality. This is also an attractive purifier. My purifier only came with a quick start guide, but the buttons are easy to figure out. There are temporary stickers on the outside of the air purifier that explain the buttons. The stickers look nice enough that I plan to leave them. There is a decal you can scan for more info. Pushing the gear turns off or on the air quality measurement. Pushing the auto will automaticaly adjust the fan speed according to the air quality needs. Pushing the \u201ci\u201d shows the particulate measurement. Pushing the picture of the cylinder with wavy lines tells the filter life left. There is a child lockout button too. This also has a color code ring that tells the air quality at a glance.",
