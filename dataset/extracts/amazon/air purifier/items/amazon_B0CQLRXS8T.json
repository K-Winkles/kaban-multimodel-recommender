Our house will smell for hours and hours after cooking even if we use the hood vent. We have been using this purifier near the cooking area and it's worked very well. Our kitchen is about 500 sq ft so it seems to be good enough for thar.It does have a few features including a timer, fan speed, and filter percent. I do wish it has a air quality indicator. I can't really complain as our house smell pretty clean even after grilling meat and cooking bacon. It's also a pretty small unit, so finding a spot to place it is no problem.",
