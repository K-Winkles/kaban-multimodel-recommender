While on the cruise I ended up accidentally discovering that you are able to operate it while it is charging the battery, so you can benefit from the around the clock purification without having to stop to charge it.I walked into the cabin to find white lint floating around in the air, revealed by the room lighting. I plugged my purifier in, left for dinner and a few shows, when I returned the lint was clear and the room smelled a lot fresher.This is a very tiny but powerful device. I would definitely say it is worth the buy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this air purifier for on the airplane. I have to say I was very impressed. The air smelled so much fresher. I purchased a 3rd party case separately to store it in my carry on. It fit perfectly. I struggled to keep it on the tray table due to handle. So I just held it.I also used it in the car that I borrowed that had a bit of \"funk\" smell. It worked great for making it smell fresher. The only struggle I had was that most of the vents were blocked by the cupholders, but it was still able to work well.Pros: This little machine is powerful for it's size. It clears the surrounding air quickly. It is a little louder than I expected, however still fairly quiet. (The video is with my bathroom fan on as well.) The battery lasts a long time.Cons: The handle that is provided fits loosely. It also does not provide a stable surface for it to lay on its side as shown in the photos. The power button can be easily turned on if not placed inside a case (which is sold separately). The vents are mostly blocked if placed inside the cupholders in your vehicle.Overall, this is a great product and I love the company who makes it. I have loved all of their products so far and would recommend to friends and family.",

It made me feel so much better to know that I had an extra layer of protection from any sniffles or bugs that might have been floating around.The battery life is also very solid for such a little unit: I ran it on high nearly the whole day at the hospital and it lasted around 8 hours. It's so petite that I can fit it in a standard car cup holder (or the one at the movie theater), and it's quiet enough that I have run it in a theater without it disturbing any other patrons.Over all, I consider this totally worth the purchase price and I'm considering getting another to keep in my office.",

The hassle of always charging this and the noise level didn't make it worth it for me to keep using when it obviously was not doing anything. Also it seems the air only flows in level 2 or 3.",

I wanted to use it consistently before reverting about it's functionality, quality, etc.I got this for my cube at work as my coworkers and I are certain there's something in the airducts causing us to have nasal congestion/allergy like symptoms.The make is sturdy feeling for a portable unit and it's compact design means I can lay or stand it pretty much anywhere in my cube. I have a convertible standing desk so I hang it from the shelf next to me while it's up and infront of me when it's down.It was simple to set up, clear and easy instructions. I let it charge for a few hours via my laptop dock and set it to the first setting for the rest of the day once it was fully charged.It isn't too loud, which is great as I have Teams/phone calls throughout the day. The battery lasts my entire shift on a daily basis after charging overnight.I feel like in the last three weeks I've not been going home as stuffy feeling and I'm not sneezing as much as I have been while in office. So it seems to be working well and with noticeable results! Very happy I gave this a shot.I plan to buy some more units for my coworkers for the holidays!",

Very pleased with how relatively quiet it is compared to other brands. It\u2019s pretty, inconspicuous and fits in my car\u2019s cup holder. Great for carpooling in the winter when windows are rolled up and lacking fresh air. We are going on a cruise this Summer and plan to take it traveling with us just for that extra protection and peace of mind in our cabin against the cruise ship\u2019s recycled air. So impressed with the performance and reasonable cost we are going to buy a second one!",
