                "reviewText": "We've got this Medify air purifier for our son's bedroom who is very sensitive to airborne allergens and pollen and to make matters worse, our home is surrounded by very large trees that release tons of pollen and since one month or so we've been using this air purifier in his room .. his allergies are much better with less runny nose and watery eyes . So from a pure functional perspective this Air purifier does its job very nicelyDESIGN & FEATURESBut this air purifier as not just about functionality alone .. it looks very well made and has a very pleasant and easy on the eye design- The shape of the purifier is a rounded rectangular cuboid with a smallish profile which means it can be used on a table/nightstand or on the floor just as well- It has touch sensitive buttons on the top panel that control features such as speeds , timers, child lock as well the ablity to turn on or off its UV lightAIR PURIFICATION- This air purifier sucks in air from two HEPA filters on either sides and releases it from the top- Only the two sides vents where the filters fit are functional air intakes , the other two are kind of fake vents and more of a design element- True HEPA 13 filtration and the results are visible in the reduction of allergies of our sonINITIAL SETUP AND ALEXA INTEGRATION- The initial setup and integration with Alexa is super easy and convenient , and as simple as scanning a barcode- After the initial setup , you can control the air purifier via voice commands- I was not able to figure out if we could set the timer modes via voice commandsQUIETNESS-The air purifier is quiet at lower speeds but it does get a bit louder at its highest speed which some may find disturbing for sleepLIKES- Beautiful design- Alexa voice controls- True HEPA 13 filtration- Since this is a mainstream Air purifier brand .. this means you are also able to buy generic off-brand filters for much cheaper than the OEM filtersDISLIKES- Only two sided air intakes. many air purifiers have 360 degree all around air intakes- Premium price tagFINAL THOUGHTSOverall this is a very nice looking and functional air purifier from a reputable brand which means you get the actual advertised air purification for your family. The availability of generic filter replacements and the alexa voice controls are the cherries on top that make it more practical.",

                "reviewText": "(First, I am now convinced there is a lot of competitor sabotage showing up in the reviews.. I was shopping for something yesterday and I was surprised at some of the negative reviews (overall rating of 3,000+ reviews = 83%).. and then, I wanted to get some replacement filters for this purifier - and now I KNOW the negative reviews are bogus - except for the random unit that is defective...I have three of these purifiers - this one, the M40 and the M14.I had serious allergies - I mean serious, throat closing up one night, etc. Was on medication and used netipot daily - for Years....I had tried a few other purifiers and returned them. Now, at last I am all in to say these purifiers are 100% amazing in cleaning the air - to the point that my allergies are pretty much gone (no kidding). No more medication. I use the netipot maybe once every couple of months.ALSO - all three units are WHISPER QUIET. Period. (Go away you negative negatives)And, I have had them for 5 months. This unit I have in my bedroom and leave it on pretty much always (on low setting)Now I know that when the vast majority of reviews are positive and then comes a slew of negative reviews (and most all are one liners) - ignore the naysayers. They're probably the competition attempting to bring down the ratings.I highly recommend Medify. I've tried at least 4 other brands and they are not worth even trying, imo.",

                "reviewText": "purchased this air purifier on a whim. I just moved into an older house and even though I got the ac and ducts cleaned, it is still dusty to me. I bought this to see if it would help with the dust and just maybe, maybe my allergies. This air purifier is wonderful. I never realized that my house had a smell and not a good smell. I unboxed the filter and set it up on the counter between my kitchen and living room. I turned it on high and went to work in the garage. About 2 hours later, I came back into the house and the smell was AMAZING!! It was clean and fresh. I have the ionization on so there was a faint smell from that but I can not believe how well this works. My son made popcorn (as you know very strong smell) and I was in my bedroom and I never smelled the popcorn. How great is that? I loved this so much that I bought 2 MA-15 for each bedroom.If I have one small complaint it would be that it can be kind of noisy. On sleep or low it has a low hum that does not bother me at all. On medium, I would have to turn up the volume on the TV. On high, it is too noisy to watch TV. I run it on high when I am not in the same room and then I run it on medium or low the rest of the time. The noise is because it is blowing a lot of air. I definitely recommend this air purifier.",

                "reviewText": "My husband has just been diagnosed with lung cancer. We bought this air filter to hopefully improve the air quality in the bedroom. This difference is amazing! We noticed the air was much fresher about an hour after putting it on. So thrilled that hubby had his first good night's sleep in ages - minimal coughing now and sleeps soundly. It's been in action for about 2 1/2 weeks and we love it. It's very, very quiet, so easy to set up, and also very nice looking. We made sure we followed the directions on placement in the room and keep the door and window closed while it's working. The bedroom is only 110 sq. feet and the MA-14 would have sufficed, but we chose the MA-15 due to the fact that it has longer lasting filters. We plan to buy a few more for the rest of the house. Highly recommend!",
