        "description": "The Scosche AFP2WT-SP FreschAir is a portable HEPA Air Purifier and deodorizer that you place inside your vehicle\u2019s cup holder or stands it on any flat surface, to create a comfortable, healthier environment. If you suffer from sensitivity to dust, pet dander, or odors, this is a must-have accessory. With two modes: automatic, which switches on when you start your car, and a manual mode that offers two fan speeds, you can set it and forget it. The portable design makes it easy to move from one car to another. The 3 stage H13 HEPA filter captures 99.5% of *PM2.5 small particles and dust plus also quickly neutralizes and releases clean, fresh air. Although designed for in-vehicle use, its small, compact size and its ability to purify an average-size vehicle in 15-20 minutes and up to 100 sq. ft of space in approximately one hour make it also great for cubicles or small offices. For best performance, replace the HEPA filter every 3 to 6 months, depending on use. Use the included USB-C charging cable to power the FrescheAir, and you can also charge a second device using the standard USB-A port on the side panel. For use in the home or office, the charging cable can be plugged into a USB home charger or into your laptop\u2018s USB Port. NOTE: *PM2.5 are fine inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.",
