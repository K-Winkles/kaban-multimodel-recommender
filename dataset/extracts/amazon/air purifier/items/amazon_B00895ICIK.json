                "reviewText": "Slim design fits in a room without being bulky or very noticeable as far as size goes. I have the tall and short machine. It is loud such like a fan on medium/high when it is on its high setting. I've set mine on power 3 (which is like the medium setting) and it seems to do the job. This is why four stars but these things are going to make noise but it becomes ambient. I have it in my master and my kitchen next to the rabbit hutch.It has cut down the odor from kitchen garbage and rabbit liter box exponentially. Also im not seeing things flying in the air when I sweep such like before. I have two dogs as well and dust has been cut down. Cuts down dander.About the smell: After a week with full garbage and rabbit liter pan, the smell before air cleaner was an 8/10 as far as those smells progress as the week goes. Once using the air purifier it is a 2/10 after a week if i did not exchange the liter pan and have a full garbage and/or dirty dishes. Definitely worth the money and I think it is very fair priced. I did not skimp on the filters as with any nock off it compromises the efficiency of the product.Used in open floor plan about 750sq. Ft with single rabbit and two dogs that use the laundry room as their space which is also open to kitchen/living room. Single women house hold, one kiddo in country.",

That\u2019s my fault has I didn\u2019t read the dimensions. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d tall and this beast comes up past mid-thigh.It\u2019s very quiet on the lower speeds so it works well when I\u2019m watching TV or have the radio on. Of course the higher the fan speed, the louder it becomes.I have a dog and two birds, so I looked for soemthing with a special pet filter. This machine has an impressive amount of different filters.I noticed a difference in the air within an hour.The only complaint I have is about the freakishly bright lights on it. When the UV light is on, there is a very bright blue light around the front top of the unit. There is no way I would be able to sleep with that light on in my bedroom. That feature can be switched off but the really bright red light (indicating the unit is on) is on all the time.Other than the two lights, I\u2019m happy with the product.",

This is by far the best air purifier I've ever had and believe me I've tried a lot of them. I tried the Winix that cost almost twice as much as my Germ Guardian but it came no where close to working half as good. The filters aren't to expensive and last. I even bought a different air purifier from HSN with no luck. I will be staying with this Air Purifier. The one thing It has is the UV light that others don't have and with that combo it cleans the air better than all the other kind. If you can't decide on which Air Purifier you want just go for this one and you want regret it.",
