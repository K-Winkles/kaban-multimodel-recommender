                "reviewText": "I bought this for a 14 x 18 bedroom with attached ensuite bathroom and I liked that it has the capacity for cleaning the air in larger rooms when needed. The automatic setting uses the air quality sensor to ramp up the fan speed when it notices a reduction in air quality. This function works great in the bedroom, but I select medium or high when I use it in the living room with a vaulted ceiling because the low/automatic setting will not move enough air to be useful. This is to be expected with larger or dirtier rooms and isn't a fault of the product.Overall a 5 out of 5 stars at $94. The fan is quiet despite having high capacity, the UVC function works without generating a large amount of ozone, and it's nice looking. It also helps that the filter replacement costs are reasonable.Update 1: I have since bought two more units at $90. The performance on high punches way above its weight, nearly matching the CFM of a Winix 5500-2 or AW80 for half the price but with about 50% more noise (the AW80 is unusually quiet at the highest speed). Medium has more than enough throughout for most bedrooms and is quiet enough to sleep with it running. On a less positive note, the two recent units did exhibit more chemical off-gassing than the original which is a bit weird. The smell dissipated within a few hours after running the unit on high in a closed room. I only mention this for those who are sensitive to these chemicals like I am.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve purchased many different air purifiers over the years and this one stands out as my absolute favorite. In sleep mode and level one it is whisper-quiet, but I can pump it up to high when I need a quick clean. A couple reviewers complained about noise - of course you\u2019re going to hear the fan on high \u2013 guess what \u2013 that means it\u2019s working! The design of this little guy cannot be overstated \u2013 it is beautiful. It is small enough to be easily carried from room to room but large enough to know it is cleaning! The one-button control is refreshingly straightforward and a testament to how user-friendly and uncomplicated technology can be when given some thought. As a pet owner and someone who suffers from year-round allergies \u2013 I have noticed a significant difference in the air when I have this running. I used to wake up in the middle of the night sneezing but no more \u2013 I set this on sleep mode and am out like a baby! I also love the peace of mind I get by going with the Germ Guardian brand. I just realized they are an American company out of Ohio, USA which gives me that additional peace of mind in knowing I am buying a quality product and supporting my neighbors. For anyone in the market for an air purifier, this one is a no-brainer. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I used this air purifier during the June 2023 east coast smoke-pocalypse (due to Canadian wildfires). The sensor definitely works as it turned red that day (I left my window open not knowing what was going to happen). Cleaned the air pretty quickly at the highest setting. Noise wise, the lowest setting is whisper quiet (I believe it is the same rate as night mode - but on night mode the sensor light shuts off). It does get progressively louder as you turn on more fans / sections (3 power settings in total). The unit is pretty nice overall. I also have the Bissell MyAir and the GermGuardian feels / weights way more substantial (also a little bigger to be fair) and has HEPA and UV (the UV can be turned off and on independently as it is separate button). I have used the UV and I didn't smell ozone. There is a \"new\" / plastic smell in the beginning regardless of UV or not, but I think that's true with all new air purifiers. I had the same \"new\" smell issue with my non-UV Bissell also (and the Bissell was even stronger in smell).I think the only complaint is that there are actually quite a couple purifier settings and you MUST rotate through it via clicking (it's auto, low, med, high, night, off I believe). The Bissell MyAir only has 2 setting so that interface is less annoying to use. That's the only gripe I have with this unit. If I could I would have given 4.5 stars, since this is a really minor issue and I feel I could shortcut better if I read the manual. Also if you are the type who just have it on auto all day I don't foresee this as an issue.Also, after reading the manual, it is possible to replace the UV light bulb (Model LB1000). There are instructions in the manual (which can be found on the Lasko website). There's no link of the product page, but it appears that LB1000 is sold on Amazon (I just searched for it).",
