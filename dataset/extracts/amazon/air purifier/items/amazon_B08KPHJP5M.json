                "reviewText": "Having an AQI sensor with an auto mode is pretty rare for purifiers at this price range. BlueAir is really cool for creating something inexpensive to be a set it and forget. I\u2019ve tested and tried many different air purifiers and while I have a favorite already, this one really deserves its praises. For starters, I want to say this is definitely a bedroom-centric purifier and isn\u2019t meant for larger open concept spaces (Opt for the 311 Auto for bigger area). The 411 auto is virtually silent on level 1. Level 2 is also pretty quiet but has a very gentle breeze sound (personally my fav for sleeping bc the white noise is calming). Level 3 definitely is a jump in sound but is good for brief quick air cleaning. Auto mode is pretty accurate with detection rate. I put out a candle that was relatively close proximity to the purifier and the sensor light turned red and gradually revved up to sift out the smoke. In another test, I blew out a candle that was further away from the purifier across the room. The sensor did take longer to begin revving up the fan (about 5 mins give or take) but nonetheless still managed to detect. I find dissipation of odors and smoke to be pretty decent. Today I was indecisive about outfits and tried on many diff things while looking in the mirror and I guess all the dust and lint kicked up and got the little guy revving up. All this to say, the AQI sensor and Auto Mode is great!Other positives:-low power consumption. It\u2019s gonna be so inexpensive on your electricity bill. Only 10watts of power max!-stylish! The prefilters are very attractive I\u2019m in a very modern minimalist space with black and whites and grays. The default pre filter it ships with fits perfectly! Diff decor? They have many different colors for you.I have to say, I doubted this thing for a bit because of its seemingly lacking power. It reminded me a lot of the Levoit Vista 200. However that model is awfully weak and not worth the money. I believe the reason why the Blue Pure 411 Auto works so efficiently well, is because it is 90% filter. There\u2019s no plastic unibody or restrictive intake grills. Just fabric and filter. Because of this, less fan power is needed to pull in air through several layers of plastic holes and super dense materials. Pretty innovative and a true example of \u201cless is more\u201d. Highly recommend for those who want a stylish, efficient minimalist air purifier for a small space.",

                "reviewText": "I have four Blue Air purifiers - one large one and three smaller ones. The large one works perfectly, but the other three (411a Max) required a gamble in getting one that works properly. I've had to return/buy a few because a couple of them made audible ticking like noises, and one of them smelled so bad I couldn't stand it. Not what I expected from Blue Air, but if you get one that works, they are great! They operate quietly and the fan kicks on higher when it detects particulants in the air. They look attractive too. I just wish quality control was better.",

Three relatives have purchased this purifier and are very satisfied with its performance. We\u2019ve had ours for a couple weeks and run it 24/7. It really has improved the air quality in our home. No more stuffiness or sneezing from pet dander, dust, etc. and it is very quiet as advertised. We set it on auto which is the recommended setting, and have it in our dining/living area. Our 411a Max is a smaller purifier bc our home is around 1,000 sq.ft. Works great! Would definitely recommend.",

In the morning, I ran our far more expensive Dyson. Initially it claimed the air quality was poor\u2026but within moments it updated to good air quality\u2026so the Dyson was satisfied with the air quality from the blueair device. The auto sensor even detected fumes from my hair color.NoiseIt\u2019s a bit loud on the highest setting - not too surprising as the Dyson is loud at high too.OverallIt\u2019s visually appealing for an air purifier. All around happy with it and compared to the pricey Dyson, great value. Going to buy a bigger one - 211 - for the main area of our home.",

My understanding is that the benefits of this unit are: 1. looks good, 2. uses washable fabric prefilter to take some of the work away from the hepa filter, 3. contains an air quality sensor, 4. has a night mode which is quiet and where the light is dimmed, and 5. probably more importantly, uses the high quality hepa filters from Blueair. My wife trusts the Blueair filters and this is probably the most important differentiator for this product. In other respects, it is similar to other filters which are available. If you like Blueair, I'm happy to recommend this.",
