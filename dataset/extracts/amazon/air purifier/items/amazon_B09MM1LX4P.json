It is quiet, although when putting up the fan level you can hear it. Truthfully sound is not a bother to me on this but it could be at the higher levels for some. The controls are easy to use, the only area I have an issue with is locking it from the child lock which could be a user issue moreso then the device. I've been impressed with this machine and how much it really has changed the air quality for how small it is in the large area it is in. I'd purchase this exact one again.",

I'm sure you can Jimmy one in the font, but the price of new filters makes it hard to justify the effort.",

This unit is placed in the living area, approximately 1000 sqft next to the pellet stove. It\u2019s done a phenomenal job thus far, proof is in the filter picture, which that filter is 6 weeks old. In terms of sound it\u2019s very quiet. Overall great product!",

I got this and a Levoit at same time and levoit is still working great! Customer service was good but could only offer small discount on a new one so I passed. Should work longer than 1.5 years.",
