I have mine in the living room and I think it clears the air on the entire floor, including kitchen and dining room. I can hear the fan but only from less than three feet away when the room is silent. It does not bother me. But it might if it was in a bedroom. Normally it runs on low but automatically runs higher if it senses more pollution. So far that's only happened once that I've noticed in about three months, due to cooking in the kitchen. It may have produced a slight scent in the first few days but I haven't noticed anything since. Unlike some reviewers, I can't say that I've noticed any significant improvement in the air in our house. I bought it as we've been having issues with smoke from forest fires in late summers.",

                "reviewText": "I'm in California and this past summer was bad in terms of wildfires and it's impact on our air quality. It's the first time where the smoke affected us INSIDE our house. It was so bad where we were that it was a thick fog of smoke at ground level for a week. We're working from home with kids and a dog. And there were days when we could see the smoke inside the house, meaning we could see haze inside. My wife was coughing and sneezing. I ended up buying two of these units, one for each floor of our house during the day and used one in our bedroom during the night. The auto mode feature is pretty cool and the sensor is pretty sensitive. Basically, it autodetects the air quality and adjust the fan speed accordingly. It not only detected smoke but it detected odors like fried fish that we made one night, which is pretty cool So it's good to remove cooking odors as well. I did test it out on a smoky day and it did detect poor air quality and upped the fan. Within 30 minutes it cleared out the air. Yes, these purifiers DO make a notable difference. They are not a gimmick. On the lowest fan setting they are VERY quiet and pretty unnoticeable. We had one in our bedroom on auto mode and it was whisper quiet!!! On the higher speeds the noise is more noticeable but not that bad. It definitely can move alot of air and I trust the sq. ft. rating. It can probably handle larger to be honest. Lastly, I like the nice touch sensitive touch pad with indicator lights to adjust fan speed and turn the unit on. It's pretty cool and futuristic.The CON... as with many reviewers, I can confirm there is a weird chemical like odor from the purifier itself. I think it's from the filter. After awhile you don't notice it but it is there. It's not super strong but noticeable. It's also pretty expensive. I'm sure there are other cheaper and maybe better options. I bought these in a rush as availability of other purifiers at the time was very little. We are happy with them overall and will likely continue to use them. They are a nice small form factor and fit well with our decor.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet and uses less energy than other air purifiers",
                "reviewText": "First, a general rave about this brand: For all of my adult life, I've had air purifiers of all kinds due to seriously bad allergies. The BlueAir Blue series are the ONLY ones that I've had that are easy to clean. I had a smaller BlueAir Blue 411 for years in a small bedroom that was great! With other brands, the expensive pre-filters either had to be thrown away when they got dirty, or I had to resort to using a toothbrush to clean the plastic framework that they were a part of. I admit that because of these annoying issues, I replaced or cleaned them less often than I was supposed to. With the Blue series, you just slide off the fabric pre-filter (it's a lot like sliding off a sock), and then throw it in the washing machine. A clean pre-filter captures the larger stuff like animal hair and dust, extending the lifespan of the main filter. A clean one therefore saves you money in the long run because you won't have to replace the main filter as often. More than anything, an air purifier that has a dirty filter probably doesn't do anybody much good, regardless of the specifications on the box.Secondly, I bought this particular model because of its capacity, air quality indicator, and because it uses much less energy than other air purifiers (only 4-38 watts). I keep it running 24/7 in a large bedroom, so energy use and noise are important. When it's in Auto mode, it comes on only when its sensors detect particles in the air, and triggering the air quality indicator LED to subtly let you know. When it's in Night mode, all of the lights on the unit turn off, it's whisper quiet, and the fan is on Low. It also has an Everyday mode (It's equivalent to a Medium setting), and a Boost mode (a High setting). It does an impressive job of cleaning the air, as well. My sinuses really appreciate it!!!",

Very quiet in night mode and acceptable during higher settings. The HEPA filters can be replaced easily however they are still okay after about 100 hours of use in the medium speed setting and with closed windows. The touch controls are neatly integrated and unobtrusive however we would prefer simpler ergonomic buttons or nobs located on the side because it is not easy to find the right setting without numerals or idiot dots. Please redesign the controls to earn 5 stars.",
