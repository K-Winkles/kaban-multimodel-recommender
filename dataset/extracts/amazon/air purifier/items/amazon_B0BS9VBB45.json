                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The hepa filter in this is good and the fan clearly works. It does get a little too loud sometimes, but I have it in a hallway where it usually doesn\u2019t matter. If I\u2019m trying to talk to my daughter from the other end of the hall and this thing is on high, there is no way I\u2019ll be able to understand her response, or even if she said anything. We would have to shout over it. That\u2019s a little annoying, but it can be set to a more quiet mode, so that doesn\u2019t matter to me a lot. TBH. I haven\u2019t even bothered with the app yet, but I will because I want to know if the air quality matches another one I have in the house that shows me on the purifier screen. I think this one is sensitive and kicks on to clean the air whenever it senses anything foreign, so it\u2019s doing its job and it also looks nice! I like the matte surface.",

The filter is a bit weird to change, but works.One thing to note, when you open it there's a sticker that shows you something about the filter. It was a bit confusing, but you have to open it up and remove the plastic sheeting and then put it back in. I found that sticker to be confusing.However, the App works, it's meh - like most of these types of forced to be smart devices. I find an air purifier is one of those set and forget type of things - just give me a notice on device when I need to change the filter, that's about all the smartness I need. Doesn't need to be \"smart\" - but its there if you are so inclined.",

Again, I have never had one before so I do not have anything to compare it to. I do notice us sneezing less and our air quality in our house seems more \u201cfresh\u201d. I know I\u2019m not using it to it\u2019s full potential yet, I\u2019m still learning, but it\u2019s been great so far and I\u2019m sure it will only get better once I really dive in deep learning more about it!
