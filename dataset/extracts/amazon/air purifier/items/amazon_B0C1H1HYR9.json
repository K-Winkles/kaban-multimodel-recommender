            "Enhanced HEPA Technology: Our H13 true HEPA filter adopts medical-grade materials and can achieve a better purification effect than traditional general HEPA. It traps 99.97% of fine airborne particles down to 0.1 microns such as pet dander, pollen, dust mites, viruses and bacteria. Allow you to be more at ease with your loved pets.",
            "High-Efficiency Activated Carbon for Pet Odor: The premium granular activated carbon filter improves deodorant ability and absorbs unpleasant pet odors, cooking smells, smoke, and VOCs without worrying about second-hand pollution, which makes it a good choice for homes with pets, kitchens, and smokers.",
            "Cost-Effectively: Using a 360\u00b0 air intake and up to 4x the filter surface area, the HEPA filter has an all-around performance that more efficiently aids in the removal of 99. 97% of dust, pollen, smoke, odor, and pet dander. This filter is exclusively designed for Welov P200S air purifiers to maintain peak performance, with a cost-effective price to save much cost for your all-year-round air cleaning need.",
            "Capture Large Particles: The ultra-fine pre-filter adopts advanced lower-density structure technology, with higher efficiency and less pressure to ensure maximum performance. The air filter captures large particles such as pet hair, dust, lint, fibers, which helps to prevent clogging and maximize the filter\u2019s life.",
            "Maintenance Tips: The filter is sealed to extend its service time. Please remove the protective bag of the new filter before use. It's recommended to replace the filter every 3-6 months, depending on how often you use your air purifier. Using your air purifier in an environment with relatively high pollution may mean you will need to replace the filter more often."

Then my husband fired up the smoker and grill - the smoke drafted into our bedroom and immediately the fan began turning faster and the light went yellow. After a few minutes, all went back to green. This unit is so very quiet, we don't even know it's on.",

Bought on March this year, already replaced the filters twice. Today the filter light is on again. Way too expensive. Will consider buying other brand as there are a lot of good air purifiers with reasonable price replacement filters.",
