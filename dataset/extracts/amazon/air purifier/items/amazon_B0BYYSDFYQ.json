            "H13 Purification Efficiency: AROEVE air purifier features a detachable and washable grille, and a HEPA filter with pre-filter, HEPA, and activated carbon layers. It effectively filters 99.9% of particles as small as 0.3 microns in the air, including dust, smoke, pollen, hair, and more. With a 1095 Sq Ft expansion area, it helps protect your family's health by providing cleaner and fresher air.",
            "Extreme Purification: With a 360\u00b0 circular air inlet design, pollutants have nowhere to hide.

Breathe easy and enjoy a cleaner, quieter environment.",
            "Unique Product Design: The suspended and detachable design adds a modernist touch to the air purifier. The transparent central body with added light creates a hovering effect. The detachable body design makes it easy to clean, simply unscrew the bottom to rinse.",
            "Boosted Power for Greater Air Flow: With a bio-inspired inclined tongue design and a triple shock and noise reduction multi-wing fan, this air purifier boasts strong and efficient power to quickly and quietly reduce harmful particles from the air, promoting clean air to rapidly spread throughout the whole area.",
            "Quiet and Restful Nights: With multi-dimensional noise reduction processing, this air purifier operates quietly. When switched to sleep mode, it produces noise as low as 24dB(A), ensuring a peaceful sleep until dawn. (Reminder: The air purifier is equipped with a 2000-hour cartridge replacement reminder. Replace the filter cartridge every 3-6 months for optimal performance.)"

                "reviewText": "So, I got this cleaner on Sunday and was surprised on how easy it was to set up. I am not sure the description is correct as it says it cleans a very large room and this thing is very small, but we will see. Twist the two cylinders take out the packaged filter place back in and twist back together. I work in a hospital and have a large office. I sat this up on Monday and put it on the #2 setting and left it running all day and overnight. The #2 setting was very quiet and did not bother me at all. The high setting was pretty loud, but I just turned it down. When I walked into my office this morning the smell was fantastic. The air felt cleaner, the dust had seemed to dissipate, and I was very relieved on how well the room smelled. I think this will be a good unit if it last very long. I did go this afternoon and look for replacement filter, but they seemed to have disappeared. Overall, in the short time I have had this I give it 5 stars. The only issue is it says 2000 lifetime and I am concerned that it will make you buy a new filter at 200 hours, but we will see. For the price you can't beat this machine.1 question is the blue light functional or just a pretty thing?ps. I did buy the Amazon extended warranty as I couldn't find a manufactures warranty. Will update if anything goes wrong.",

With this Air Purifier i have now a really good air quality in my house. No \"bad\" smell of standing air anymore. I bought a second one for my bedroom and what should i say - its really quite i have a very light sleep but i can sleep and i feel really better, can better breath and have a better sleep in my opinion. 10 stars from me and i love that this one is for large rooms.",
