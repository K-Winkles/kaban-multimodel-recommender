Have it by home HVAC air intake and combined with those filters, keeps the odor fresh. It\u2019s near my bedroom and the bright blue light is obnoxious, so keep that in mind. (Place a tape over it or move it. Does make a nice nightlight). I love the fact it alerts when needs cleaned (so far, haven\u2019t needed) and wipes with damp cloth. My first one died after a great, long life of 15 years. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I love this thing.. I have had several of these things.. They do wear out, but takes a long time.. I have two of them now.. They work great.. Having said that, the biggest complaint I have heard is that they make noise, they shut off when they should not, etc.. I went through all that years ago.. So I understand how unhappy people can be with this product.. So, why do I like mine so much when other people almost hate theirs???? I learned how to clean them.. The people who sell them do not give you instructions for the proper cleaning of these units.. The secret is rubbing alcohol. I am not sure the instructions I wrote for cleaning this thing is still on Amazon or not, but if not, here is a short version. When the red light comes on, or the machine starts making the cracking zapping noise, unplug it. Take the blades out, grab a few paper towels and a bottle of plain ole rubbing alcohol.. Soak the paper towel in alcohol, or at least put a lot on it so that it is very wet, then wipe the blades down.. Lots of crap will come off the blades.. Keep doing this until the blades are clean. Then wipe with dry towels.. Then, let the blades sit for a half hour or so and dry out.. You want them really dry... Second step is to clean the wire in the back of the unit.. It is hard to get to.. I advise people to wrap a paper towel around a toothbrush handle, or similar, attach with a rubber band, get the towel very wet with alcohol, then wipe the wire up and down with the wet towel.. Then let this dry for one half hour, or until you are sure it is dry.. REASSEMBLE and turn it on.. It should work like a charm. If it does not, then you did not get it clean.. Repeat the process until it is working properly.. Went it is working as it should, it does a great job of pulling dirty stuff out of the air.. I mean a lot of dirty stuff..... Ok, get one, keep it clean, and be happy.. Better yet, get more than one!",

Maybe I'll call the company, but it's not under warranty anymore so I don't know. If I do give them a call and it works out, I'll change my review. However, for this thing to have worked for such a short time and then just be... unfixable... I'm SUPER disappointed. Especially at this price point.

It takes up VERY little floor space, it makes zero noise, and what I didn't realize - at time of purchase - is that, though it has no fan, it MAKES ITS OWN BREEZE by quantum electromagnetic phenomena to suck air through! Talk about effectiveness ..with its ionizing system it is essentially guaranteed to capture virtually every single particle of smoke in the vicinity. HEPA filters are a FAR cry from that exemplary capability, and they make noise, have fans. The only lament - but one can take measures to combat it - is that: though it captures each smoke particle there are millions of molecules, I guess, constituting each particle; so the matter stuck to the ion blades are capable and do release plenty of stink. You combat this effect by turning the machine facing with the breeze going AWAY from you. If you can place it close to one of your homes forced-air intake grates, odor will be quickly dispatched. I was fortunate where my easy chair is situated, next to such a grate. I simply set my thermostat's circulation fan to ON instead of AUTO. (My forced-air system's fan is in the basement, so whisper quiet.)",

                "reviewText": "Changed Review from one star to three stars. Unit is not a complete piece of non-functional garbage, yet lacks the quality of the older models (200 sq. ft.). The removable and cleanable blade is an excellent feature, however, my opinion is the blade to the 500 sq. ft. model is of lesser quality. The blade appears to be manufactured out of a different metal and does not clean the air like the older models with the super shiny blade. The machine is a bit louder (static sound) even with cleaning. After removing the unit from an extremely dirty environment, the machine still smells new, which is impressive considering the air quality it was residing within was absolutely disgusting. It's not a machine I can highly recommend but it's not a complete piece of junk either. If you're looking for a top notch air purifier this is probably not the unit for you. Amazon seems to send me used/junk items which is extremely disappointing to say the least. If you don't like the unit you can always return it. Hopefully this review was helpful. Thank you for reading and may it smell better in your environment!",
