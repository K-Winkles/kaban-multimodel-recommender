                "reviewText": "To be honest I'm not really sure whether this is working effectively or not. I guess I probably won't know just how much it's filtered out of the air until I change the filter, and I'm not sure exactly when I should do that. My house has so much pet hair and dust (especially in the winter when we burn wood and the smoke and ash causes extra dust) that I'm guessing I should change it more often than the average household. The room I put this in is a bedroom, but it's not exactly a small room - it used to be two rooms before a wall was knocked out and they were combined into one. Also I wasn't sure about positioning - I've got it on a nightstand right next to my bed, but I'm not sure that's the best idea, since I don't want it pulling all the dust and allergens over in my direction. I haven't noticed much difference in my congestion level while sleeping when I've been running the purifier, but since some nights are always worse than others it's hard to judge. I do like the noise it makes, since it's very soft and steady, like a white noise machine.",

Oh, and make sure if you do have one of these, that the filter is still in a package, inside the machine, so you need to remove it, take the packaging off, and reinsert it before using the machine.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In the video you can hear the sound volume as the speeds change. There are three intervals:Low: suggested for night timeMedium: suggested for daytime useHigh: suggested for quick purificationYou hit the power button once to change each speed. Hitting a fourth time will turn the purifier off. With the small size, this will work in a smaller room best.It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space and I use it in my laundry room where I temporarily have the cats. A wallflower helped but scent mixed with cat after a while and I needed something just a little extra.No batteries or charging required you plug into the wall. Please note the wall plug in is NOT included only comes with the USB cable. However, any standard box will do.",
