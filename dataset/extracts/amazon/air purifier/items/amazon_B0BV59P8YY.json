Even after letting the pieces air out for days, they still were stinky.. so I caved on this Dyson during prime days. The app breaks down different types of crud sensed in your air and graphs it, plus the machine is intuitive to use. The air flow even gets really strong while remaining quiet; this is my quietest filter unit! I love it but not enough to replace all my existing HEPA filters for the price tag; it was necessary for reducing formadehyde furniture off gassing and has done a good job at it.",

                "reviewText": "I've been eye-ing this product for awhile and I'm SO glad I purchased it during Amazon Prime Day Sale. Biggest concern I had was the high-pitched noise that everyone was complaining about. I had a $40 fan in my room before this and honestly, Dyson's \"high pitched noise\" is nothing compared to the cheap fan noise I had before.Filter is SO easy to put in, mobile app is so nice to have, and the little display on the fan itself showing different levels of particles, NO2, HCHO, etc is really nice too! I honestly didn't think I'd need Formaldehyde filtering but to my surprise, my room had high levels of it!I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has limited space and can't have both a fan and an air purifier in the room without losing floor space. Personally, fan function works good enough to cool me down at night.",

                "reviewText": "I had seen the reviews talking about a high pitched noise that people were experiencing with their units. This initially made me hesitant to purchase this unit. However, I saw Dyson's responses somewhere talking about how lifting the unit by the upper loop part is what causes this issue to start happening. I thought that I'd try buying one of these and make sure not to lift it by the upper fan part. First of all, it's super awkward to lift and move this unit by the base since there is nothing to grab on to. Most importantly, not lifting by the upper fan part and only lifting by the base didn't matter at all! The unit started making the dreaded high pitch noise everyone is talking about within a month of use on the 'auto' setting. Don't take the chance on buying this unit like I did!",
