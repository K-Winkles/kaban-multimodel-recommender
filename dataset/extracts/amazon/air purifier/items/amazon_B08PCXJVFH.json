You can just tell the difference when you breathe! Sleep and medium mode are almost completely silent. High sounds like a small fan. None are disturbing to us. Small, lightweight, powerful. 10/10.",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered this, I was expecting something bigger based on the square footage the description said it could handle. While I didn't use it in the intended space because of the size, I placed this in a bedroom and was pleasantly surprised at how well and how quickly it worked. I live in a condo and have been experiencing air quality issues because of a neighbor's smoking. I put this in the bedroom and ran it on high for a few hours. The smell was gone in no time. It's pretty loud on high so I wouldn't suggest using that mode unless you're not in the room. Sleep mode is nice and quiet and the medium isn't much louder than a tower fan. It's lightweight and easy to get up and running. You have the option of turning the lights off, which is nice; however, there's still a tiny indicator light that shows which mode you're in. I wish there was a way to turn that one off at night but it's a minor annoyance. Overall, this is a great buy.",
