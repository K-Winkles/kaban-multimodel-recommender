Well not all of them last 20 years so read the manual.The auto feature worked great for a month then stopped working. I did my best to clean the auto sensor and had no success getting it to work as well on auto mode. That said I just use the app now from my phone to control its features.Best air filter I\u2019ve had. When my roommate cooked with oil or if any smoke occurs this thing really does a good job.

                "reviewText": "First impressions of the NuWave air purifier, big, powerful, nice looking and very quiet on lower settings. Even on top setting where it blows a heck of a lot of air it isn\u2019t impossible to sit next to it.The Nuwave is a lot bigger than my Sans but with comes with obviously a much more powerful fan and has the added flexibility of an app to control it. I decided to get a second purifier for the main part of the house and use the Sans in my often dusty bedroom. I like the Sans but was drawn to the NuWave as it has several filters and a couple of them are washable and they provide spares of the other filters. There should be no filter replacement costs for five years at least. In fact when I got it there was a sticker saying if I registered my NuWave they will send me figure spare filters for free. I will update the review if anything changes but right now I am delighted with my purchase. Let\u2019s see how it performs over the coming days!",

                "reviewText": "We love our Nuwave OxyPure Smart Air Purifier. It cleans our whole house, 2700 sq ft. We have had a lot of construction lately in our house which resulted in sheet rock dust everywhere (repiping) and dust from installing 10 replacement windows. Once we received it and set it up, we have been extremely impressed. We notice a big change in the air we breathe now and are excited to know it is cleaning our house. Two years ago, we bought 2 small air purifiers for our bedroom and den which we were very happy with, and still are. But now, just to have the Nuwave cleaning all the rooms we are very excited. It was so easy to set up and we love that it's on rollers and easy to move should we choose. We placed it in the center of our house and it easily tackles the big jobs. We laugh when we are cooking, especially fish. Once the aroma reaches the Nuwave, it gears up and tackles the fish smell, which disappears in minutes -- which is amazing. No buyer's remorse here, just wish we would have bought this long ago.",

                "reviewText": "This unit is easy to use and works when you need it.We have it in our restaurant seating area which is about 4800 cu Ft. This unit is supposed to take care of 2500 cu Ft, I believe. However, it works great in our seating area of 20X20X12.I noticed it instantly detects foul orders (dirty mop buckets, garbage cans rolling next to it) and instantly kicks into another gear to clear the air when in auto.The turbo button (not sure it's called \"turbo\") is a a good way to prep the area if you know you'll be working in the area. We just opened and this came in handy during and after our restoration.It is quiet and looks really nice. It is easy to move and has many control options. We use the auto mode while open and manually turn it off at night. It has a timer and scheduler but we've not used those features yet. There are a lot of filters and many extra filters. That's a nice bonus.A little on the pricey side, but for the volume of air we ask it to clean, and all its features, it's worth the investment.Strange this is, after I've been working all day and stand next to this unit, it kicks into high gear and the indicators show \"dirty\"... Maybe it's trying to tell me I need a shower? ... I take it that the sensor is tuned to sense humidity and sweat and reacts to conditions in the air.Love this unit, I recommend purchasing.",
