                "reviewText": "I bought this air purifier to replace a cheaply made, loud Holmes model that I bought from Walmart. To be fair, it did a decent job, but I wasn't impressed at all. So I ordered the Guardian because, I won't lie, I loved how it looked in the pictures and, more importantly, it had received universally great reviews. After using the Guardian for the past three days straight I can personally attest to the great reviews. This machine is quiet, works wonderfully, and is by far the most aesthetically pleasing air purifier I've ever seen.The only unfortunate thing I can say about it, and others have touched on this issue as well, is that there is a burning plastic smell that I noticed for the first several hours upon turning on the power. My room is medium sized, roughly 75-80 sq. feet (if I had to guess), and the smell was quite potent, especially for the first hour. I remember wondering if the thing would be kind enough to suck up its own smell, but the answer of course was no. Luckily, the smell soon faded and this purifier has been great ever since. I've read other complaints about the glowing blue light keeping people awake at night. I'm glad I'm stubborn and ignored these reviews, because those complaints almost kept me from buying the damn thing. I wouldn't say the light is exactly bright, more of a soft glow, but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing (as I very much am) you can simply turn off the U.V. while you sleep. It will continue to work amazingly without this feature running, although I do leave it on during the day while I'm at work. Does it actually do anything? I have no idea.Finally, I want to add that in NJ, where I live, this is currently prime allergy season, but when I wake up I feel completely neutral, as if the air outside weren't saturated with pollen (and God knows what else--it's NJ!). It's actually quite amazing.Pros: great for allergies, strong quiet suction, aesthetically pleasing beyond belief, will keep your space smelling nice, virtually no dust anywhereCons: that damn smell for the first several hoursBe back in a few months with an update!!",

The look is great, it\u2019s not too big or small, it\u2019s quiet on the highest setting and in the course of a few hours we immediately notice a better quality of air in the room we keep it in! Wether you have pets or not, maybe you just like a fan blowing clean air while you sleep this purifier is great. Keeps air clean, cools you off while you\u2019re sleeping or awake, doesn\u2019t bother you by sound, the size is perfect and the price is right. Nothing to not like!!!",

I have 2. 1 for bedroom and 1 for living room. Not an eye sore either. Very sleek in appearance and modern style. I can definitely tell a difference in air quality. I am no longer in sneezing fits.

                "reviewText": "I hate being wrong, but when I am, I take ownership of it and try to make it right. I initially gave this a three star review because I felt like that it was doing a good job of filtering out the particles in the air, but not so good at filtering the odors. I think that I expected too much, too fast. As it has been running in my daughter's (and her two ferrets) room for several days now, it is doing better. It does not completely de-odorize the room, but it is doing more than I thought at the beginning and is worthy of four stars.I am still looking for a filter that can reliably scrub the air of ODOR as well as particles. This is definitely an improvement over the room without the air filter. The odor is lessened a great deal. Not 100% but I would say between 2/3 to 3/4 of the odor has been removed and now, instead of an overwhelming ferret scent when you walk into the room, it is about 1/3 to 1/4 what it used to be. That's GOOD. Not great, but GOOD. Upped to four stars - the original review follows:--------------------------------------------------------------------I am sure this thing probably filters the air of many allergens and small objects of dust and other debris, but that is not REALLY why we bought it. You see, my daughter REALLY wanted a ferret as a pet. She set her mind to getting one and eventually conned my wife into saying that we would \"consider it\" and that she could \"possibly get a ferret.\"Then my wife did research on them and told her that she wouldn't be able to get one because they are social creatures and it would be better to get TWO ferrets.At this point, I was consulted!?!?! I may be dumb, but I am not stupid. I could clearly see that my daughter had already won the war and any battles I fought at this point would be wasted energy.So, we got Bojangles and Nibbles (short for \"likes to eat your toes and fingers\").We knew that ferrets have a musky scent (read: strong odor) but we were sure we could keep it under control. We thought that we would bathe them regularly and clean their litter box regularly.Let me give you a quick education on ferrets. 1. You cannot bathe them very often, it is bad for them to be bathed more often than once or maybe twice a month. In fact, over-bathing can cause their bodies to produce MORE OILS and more \"scent\" to try and make up for the drying of their skin that you do if you bathe them too often. 2. Ferrets have an AMAZING biology. They have a very fast metabolism. Simply put, this means that they go from Mouth to Litter Box in under four hours. That's right, they eat, and they poop. A lot. A whole lot. So there is no \"keeping up with the litter box.\" You basically clean it twice a day - morning and night, and it still stays full of poop. 3. Ferrets have sensitive respiratory systems. This means that they can only have certain, non-scented and non-clumping kinds of litter. Basically, they cannot use litter that would help with the odors.Long story, well - long - these ferrets are quite odor-iffic!That's when we thought of Amazon. After all, we had shopped here for hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of ferret cages and supplies, why not find an expensive air cleaner for the room and put an end to this madness?Well, it is my experience that so far, we haven't found the air cleaner that can handle Bojangles and Attack-Ferret - I mean, Nibbles. We tried a less expensive model of another brand that didn't even have charcoal in it that I could see, but it had lots of very good reviews - even from people with ferrets. It made no difference.Then I came looking with a better idea of what we needed. I checked both the reviews and specifications and this has it all - UV-C, Hepa Filter and Charcoal. I thought maybe that would be what we needed to make a difference. Well, we have been running it on HIGH (5) with the UV-C light on for three days straight now, and I cannot tell a difference. Not even a small imagined difference.We will give it another week, but likely will pack it up and send it back and try something more expensive.One last note, I'm not certain our GermGuardian AC5350B 28\" was brand new. It didn't have any plastic film anywhere and the cord was not wound nicely. It had a twist tie on it, but it did not look or feel as though it had been wound by a machine. I suspect our unit was used by another person who tried it briefly and decided it wasn't going to work, and neatly repackaged and returned. I may be wrong, but if I am wrong, then the packaging is not very professional and that's a strike against it as well.Sorry for the length, I wanted to make it clear what we had done and what was happening. I believe it probably filters a lot of stuff out of the air, but it is not clearing the odors like I had hoped at this price point. Hopefully I can help others out there. I will likely be leaving a review on another air filter/cleaner/ deodorizer soon - and I pray that will be a five star review. Sadly this one is not.",
