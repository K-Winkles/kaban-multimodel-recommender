                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I already have one air purifier in my home but wanted another one for our baby room to keep it dirt free and with better air quality. Decided to go with any brand that is known to me and ended up with this after comparing multiple features and I am loving it for the below reasons. This one definitely does a better job of purifying air faster than the other one that I have at home.Have been using this product for 1+ week and below are my 2 cents :Pros:- It does the job of air purifier very well. It changes from red to blue to green pretty fast. While cooking it shows cranked up AQI number and cleans fast. Smell normalizes in the room pretty fast. 3-Stage True HEPA Filtration- Different level of fan control : 3 levels + Auto. You won't hear anything when on speed 1. Very silent- Misses night/sleep mode but at fan speed 1, it is definitely with very low noise but not as low as night/sleep mode does on other purifiers- Real-time air quality index with color-coding- Has front display instead of being on the top, so easy to see the AQI's from far as well- Timer functionality of 1 to 8 hours settings is a nice to have feature too- Sleek and modern design giving a great aesthetic to the room- Reasonably priced for the functionality and efficiently- 12 months warranty with 18 more months extension after registering the product. This gives a long term peace of mind and also shows that the manufacturer is confident in his productCons:- Missed night/sleep mode- There is no smart WIFI connection feature and so can't be controlled remotely. I wish it had one for this price as I do have it with my other air purifier at home. It is so convenient to control it via app or voice control- Filter replacement is a little costly but it's the same for all brandsRecommended if you want to be within a $200 budget and with good air-purifying capability.",

                "reviewText": "Had it for a day. Took a chance and bought 4 of them for the bedrooms.Very quiet even on fan speed 3.Sleek modern design and because the intake air vents are on the side, the unit can hug a wall... Have mine four inches out. I've been running the units on high now for a day and it shows blue consistently now. Blue is rhe best, green is moderate and red is not so good.First day the blue would turn to green and sometimes red. Today it is consistently blue. Progress!My intent is to place each unit on auto and have them run all the time, ramp up when the sensor detects poor air quality or orders. Auto mode and level 1 fan are probably about the same and can't hear anything really. Sleep mode could have used an actual button. You have to cycle through the fan settings 1 through 3 and after 3 is sleep mode where the fan works silently and the front display is off except for a dim white light that let's you know the unit is on and probably so you don't trip over it in the middle of the night.So to get to night mode, press the fan button four times. Beep beep beep beep... Yeah a dedicated sleep button is in order.Other than the lights going off for sleep mode, the fan speed is about the same as auto or level 1. Now the dilema begins... I like the white noise at night so level 3 is great and it is soothing, however the led display is pretty bright in a dark room.I'm okay with it but don't think my wife will be. Also, sleep mode is not pushing out a lot of air. I like the idea of max cleaning while sleeping, but will have the bright lights. To make this unit perfect, dedicated sleep button and a dedicated display on/off so people can run any speed of fan and turn off the led lights.The units are great for bedrooms, or a small living room etc. We are getting a larger unit different manufacturer, to handle the downstairs and upstairs open air design. Between having the bedroom units and the larger capacity unit in the shared living spaces, I think we will be breathing very good air! A must for allergy and asthma! I do notice the difference in air quality when going into the bedrooms now. And did sleep much better last night.Yay! Air purifiers rock!I looked at a lot of air pruifirers before deciding upon this one. So far so good!Filters are thick and you can see the actual granulated carbon pieces in the honeycomb filter back side. Very good!Next is trying auto mode 24x7 to see if the air quality maintains!",
