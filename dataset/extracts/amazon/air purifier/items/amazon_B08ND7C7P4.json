                "reviewText": "Missy important take away from this review is to ignore the suggested filters Amazon shows and ONLY ORDER the filters from Membrane Solution! I ordered the filter Amazon showed for this air purifier, that didn't work. Tried another that said it was for MSA3 Air Purifier and again a no go.I searched Membrane Solutions and found that their filters are only ones that will work with their air purifier.Now I do like it and feel like it works. I have 5 animals and so notice difference in odor. I also notice less dust...I have two in my 1200 sq. ft. home. I have had to change the filter every 3 months... again, I have 5 animals so I feel that's responsible.It's very quiet even on high which I keep it in that mode almost 24/7.I do wish I had the app or even a remote for it, but I don't think it was worth the extra for the version that has the app. There is a timer so that works well as long as I remember to turn back on which I do forget every now and again.Overall, I would say great buy. As I said I have two which I got the second after two months of having the first.Good deal for what it is and I don't think it'll disappoint as long as you know to buy the actual Membrane Solutions filter\ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "Update 1 week. Working great, off the flonase and pataday eye drops, still taking zyrtec and will probably always have to since I'm never going to not be allergic to my dog. Albuterol use is down quite a bit. Has been on Turbo 24/7. Noticed A LOT less dust accumulation in my fully carpeted apartment. I've decided to make the 2nd unit of my planned purchase, another msa3. Cannot beat it for $100! Very happy so far. Will update again in a few months.The 1st two settings are about identical as in zero noise and minimal suction if any. Setting 3 & Turbo are about identical as in exact same fan/motor speed & noise. Essentially this has 2 settings 1/2 Almost Off & 3/Turbo Medium. Have had it on Turbo for about 15hrs now. Air quality is noticeably better. I have extreme asthma, pet & outdoor allergies. We recently received a gifted \"hypoallergenic\" puppy (there's no such thing btw) and I've had to over load on nasal spray (Flonase), eye drops (Pataday), zyrtec and albuterol. Am going to let all meds wear off & monitor how often I need albuterol to see which meds I can do without having this air purifier running 24/7. If this fails to work good enough I will have to use this as a bedroom unit & by a Winix. I know for SURE the Winix worked like a miracle for me while dating someone with an extreme dander producing pit bull. Within 24 hrs of the Winix going in there I could stay for days AND breathe. I got this Msa3 because of the $40off coupon making this unit only $100. The winix is $170. I intended to end up with 2 air purifiers anyways but figured I'd try this msa3 1st to see if the 2nd will also be an msa3. So far the settings and suction power are just not impressing me like the winix did. I will say even on Turbo, its VERY quiet. I still need a box fan for actual sleep noise. The blue lights are not very bright but I can see how some may think it's too much light for sleeping. I will update this review in about a week, after narrowing down meds and deciding if the 2nd unit will be another of these or the winix.Update a year late but better than never \ud83e\udd2a I love this unit. The replacement filters are expensive, however, I am able to GREATLY extend the life of each filter by simply vacuuming both sides and pressing the reset button. The 1st time I replaced it was at about 5 months and I'm ordering another just now, about 9 months later. It's still on 24/7 but I use the Turbo setting during the day and turn it down when everyone else comes home at the end of the day. Runs like a champ and you can absolutely notice the difference in air quality if it is off for any period of time.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: My house is not high traffic and I only have 1 small dog that does not shed. I do the regular, not over the top vacuuming of the floor and furniture. I have not done any frying or heavy cooking. The filter is only 2 months old and is down to one quarter of life left. Knowing that an air filter is just a fan and filter, my next purchase will be a less expensive brand with cheaper and maybe universal type filter. I have noticed less dust on the furniture and electronics (dust magnets!) but think smaller units, with strategic placement might do the job as well. I still compliment the manufacturer for making a good product, but filter cartridge life is no where near what is advertised. I purchased the smart model, my dumb move as it was impossible to pair with my Android phone even after Customer service and I tried every workaround. I was refunded the difference in price. The customer service was honest in telling me there was no difference in the units. I have been running it on Auto since my purchase about a month ago. I hesitated reviewing until I saw if it made a difference in dust and if it actually covered the square footage as advertised. It has made a difference in dust and helps eliminate cooking odors that linger. It is very quiet even on high fan. The indicator seems to be accurate turning from green to yellow to red as air quality diminishes and changes back to green. You can notice the difference in the air smells. Since the coverage area in less than stated, I will be purchasing another to put in the larger master bedroom. Bottom line, don't look for miracles. Make sure you dust and vacuum before your initial startup. Unfortunately it won't suck the dust off or out of furniture; you have to do that yourself. Since I'm purchasing another, that's testimony enough to the fact that this air purifier does help. The filter cartridges are not expensive and seem to last. Remember, as in all air purifiers, they are just fans and filters.",

                "reviewText": "Really liked the fact that the setup was so simple. The ability to shutoff the system lights is a nice touch. I recommend sitting the purifier on a table where the airflow to the intakes are not restricted. At first I tried it on a low end table in my living room, but the furniture around it seemed to block the intake and it wasn't working as well as I expected. I then decided to place it on a high table with no air restrictions and it works much better. Clears cigarette smoke immediately and removes the smell. It also removed the dog smell from my apartment quickly. I can definitely tell a difference in the air quality in our home after just 2 days of use. The air smells crisp and clean now.",
