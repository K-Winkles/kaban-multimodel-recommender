This machine, of which I'm rocking 3 now, has not let me down one bit. The small filter quickly fills with gunk, the air quaility sensor works perfectly, and quite mode is hardly audible(I cannot sleep with light or sound in my room) I love the quite and lights out mode for sleep, and auto with lights everywhere else. Replacement filters could be had for as low as 10 dollars even! The build quaility is something everyone comments on, and its sleek design fits right at home with me. I love the brand now, and their extended warrantee is such a nice touch. I doubt I'll ever need it though:)",

However, after 6 months it came time to replace the filter, and they are impossible to find. Not only are they very hard to find (and expensive), all the ones I\u2019ve found, despite bring an exact replacement DON\u2019T WORK. The filter button constantly goes off, even if I\u2019ve changed it 5 mins prior. All in all, if filter replacements were easier, I\u2019d totally recommend this product as it is very good and easy to use, but it\u2019s not worth considering buying another to get around the filter problem.",
