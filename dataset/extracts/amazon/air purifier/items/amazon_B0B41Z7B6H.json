I had been putting off buying one not knowing which one would accommodate my large living area and into the kitchen. This one does it! I am amazed how clean and fresh the air feels and smells. When I have it on the highest speed, it is semi loud but it just sounds like a large fan. in the background which doesn't bother me. I have 1 large and 1 medium sized dog and apparently I just got used to the normal dog smell because now I can really tell a difference. I am still shocked on how different the air quality feels.I am disappointed with the aromatherapy feature. When I initially add scented oil, if I stand over it I can smell it but it does not last and does not cover the room. It's okay, though because the air smells so fresh having it on. If I want scented air, I can continue using the assortment of plug-ins I've been using.I definitely recommend this! On a side note, it almost is like an air conditioner making the air cold which I love even more!",

The auto feature is great running more when there are odors and turns low when the air is clean. The sleep mode is very quiet. Even the loudest setting is not that loud. Easy to use and because it is small it doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space.",
