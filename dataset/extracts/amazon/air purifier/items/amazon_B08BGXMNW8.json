The Bionaire Medium Room True HEPA Air Purifier purifies the air using a 360-degree air intake system to efficiently capture air from all around a room. The 360-degree filter works to clean your air in 3 stages. The first stage captures large particles like hair and dust in the pre-filter. In the second stage, small particles as small as 0.3 microns pass through the True HEPA filter, which removes up to 99.97% of airborne allergens from the air including smoke, mold spores, pet dander, pollen, dust mites, and bacteria. Finally, in the third stage, the carbon layer eliminates common household odors such as cooking fumes and pet odors. This True HEPA air purifier can clean the air in spaces of about 155 square feet, making it ideal for most bedrooms. Features a low/quiet setting that allows it to continue cleaning the air throughout the night without disturbing your sleep.",

I got it during covid when I was sick with a cold and was living in an apartment that probably had mold. At any rate, I was indoors a lot and needed cleaner air. This purifier works great!One thing I've noticed is that a lot of reviewers are saying they can't find any replacement filters. But I've been buying replacement filters on Amazon and they seem to work great. I do think maybe they don't last quite as long, but it could just be that I live in a very dusty house. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So here is the link for all y'all.Bionaire Genuine 3 in 1 True HEPA Air Filter for BAP9921 Air Purifier,White https://a.co/d/gvMllPuI hope this helps y'all out!",

Put one in the bedroom, and we are sleeping better. The reduction in the amount of dust is fantastic. Out sinuses see, to be more clear, and we aren\u2019t waking up feeling clogged.The fan is not exactly quiet, so we have it on medium, and it acts as a white noise machine.The filter doesn\u2019t need to be changed but once a year.I so highly recommend this.",
