                "reviewText": "I was excited to get the air purifier to circulate and clean the air in a small office space. Once I opened the package, however, I knew it was a scam. The product is too light to be able to function in any way that is advertised. I thought however, that I would try plugging it into a USB power outlet to test it. It took tapping the power button several different ways before a light indicated that it was powered on, but nothing happened. I moved it to another outlet, and I couldn't get it to power on again.",

                "reviewText": "Ion generators generally run $40-$200. This is a $20 ion generator and I want you to keep this in mind as you purchase this. Its light and made of very basic plastic. Its the sort of thing that you can find in any five or ten dollar store, so don't expect iPhone quality. That being said, It looks nice, it seems to work ok. The fan moves air, but isn't noisy. The night light feature isn't too bright, which is nice.Two things that surprised me was; 1. The buttons are marked in Chinese with the english translation being in fine print beneath the Chinese. (not a big deal.) 2. The USB cable is part of the machine. Meaning that you cant replace the cable.All in all, does it do what it says? YesDo I think this will last a long time? Probably not, but for $20 I'm not too disappointed.EDIT:Ok, I actually decided to test this. I Vape, and anyone who knows about vaping knows that we can produce huge clouds of smoke, so I took a clear 2 gallon plastic jar that I have, filled it with smoke to the point you could not see the unit inside it, then timed it. This little unit actually impressed me. It removed the smoke in just under four minutes.To get an idea how long it would take the smoke to settle without the machine, I redid the experiment without the machine in the jar. I stopped timing it after twelve minutes. The smoke really didn't settle much by that point, so it proved to me that it was the machine that had cleaned the air the first time.Again, I'm rather impressed.",
