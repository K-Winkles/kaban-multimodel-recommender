Slevoo BS-03 H13 True HEPA air purifier is exactly at the end of the affordable spectrum without having to sacrifice on the filtration. The distinctive black exterior with a top turbine outlet is very pleasing. At a compact cylinder shape of 9.6 inches in diameter and 17 inches in height, it is highly suited for places with bad air. Complementing that is the lightweight 3.2 pounds that makes room to room purifying and for traveling an effortless task. Moving to usability, Slevoo BS-03 front controls are clearly laid out and easily visible for a quick setup. You can adjust the fan speeds, reset the filter change indicator, lock the controls from children and pets, and light dimmer button that turns off indicator light for night use. Adding all that is a fragrance sponge slot underneath the turbine that you can insert your favorite essential oil (not inculded) like Citrus, Honeydew Melon, Musk, Vanilla, Orris or Vetiver to freshen the air. With its cylindrical base, the Slevoo air purifier can pull in air from all directions in your room. This provides better overall coverage. The air outlet is from the top surface of the air purifier. The outlet is slightly slanted downwards so that the air does not escape directly upwards. Clean air flows into your room smoothly as a result. VERY IMPORTANT: While the air purifier will arrive fully assembled, the filter will be encased in protective plastic. Unless this plastic cover is removed, the air purifier will not work even if it is turned on.You should replace the filter every 3-6 months, depending on use. In the product's graphic introduction from the brand, there is a guide on how to buy a genuine replacement filter of BS-03 Air Purifer, which is only under 20 dollar for two filter and expect a recurring only under 50 dollars in cost a year.",

                "reviewText": "I am so impressed with this tiny purifier. Sleep mode is quiet and it does purify air in my bedroom.Like that I can also use Essential oils to diffuse. Easy to put together. Don't turn on until you take out the plastic on the filter that is located inside the filter. Replacement filters are affordable and durable.",

Seller contacted me and offered to send me a replacement without requiring me to go through the hassle of packaging and sending the old unit back. The replacement unit works as expected so I'm perfectly content with my purchase.Overall this unit could be much better if there was more QC on the fan. The one I received has a fan that makes a rattling sound when it runs at higher speeds.",

I felt like it collected dust from the air and helped keep the room smelling neutral. I noticed it had stopped working at the end of August I didn\u2019t have time to look at it then and I thought it was probably come unplugged or user error. (Me). When I had time to look at it closer and try other outlets, checked the filter which it had a new one and I realized, it\u2019s done. I definitely expected more than 5 months of out it. I could have a bad one and it wasn\u2019t that expensive. Just disappointed.",
