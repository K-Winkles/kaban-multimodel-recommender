After the first night, I noticed that my nose wasn't stuffed up in the morning, and I also had a better night's sleep. I love that I can diffuse my Lavender with it, which is really a bonus. It's absolutely quiet on the Sleep setting, and I really appreciate that there's no light on during the night. I've been using this every night for 6 months, have gently vacuumed the filters a couple of times, and hand washed the diffuser pad, and it still works great. I plan on ordering extra filters and pads, but so far haven't really needed to change them. Considering the price for this model, I'd say that overall, it has performed beyond my expectations, and I highly recommend it!",

Some days before a dog bath you can smell that dog smell, or when you're frying that after smell, those take awhile to disappear. As soon as this item arrived I plugged it in and it was amazing. Smells gone, dander reduced and best of all it doesn't take up much space. I've read other reviews about a plastic smell but follow directions and remove the plastic on the filter, that's the only step then done. It sucks the air and blows out the clean air so as a note sitting in front of it is like a fan, you'll feel the cold air. It works so well I bought for other rooms as well as for my mom and brother.",

It\u2019s a great size, has a couple control setting levels, and looks great! Easy to setup & get going.I had something smelly in my kitchen that was lingering, brought this guy up to set in the kitchen, and it helped a TON. It\u2019s a larger open space so it wasn\u2019t perfect but it was very effective in filtering out whatever was in the air.",

                "reviewText": "I think this does a great job of cleaning the air. My office is about 99sqft, so on the smaller side, so it definitely makes a difference. It\u2019s pretty quiet, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a 8.5 / 10 on silence scale on the highest setting which is the only setting I use to blast away those germs! Low and sleep mode are basically silent 10/10. My office building is older and when I started working here i had stuffy nose and nose bleeds and sneezed all the time, now I don\u2019t! Also, several people have gotten sick in my office building, colds and cv19, and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to steer clear of all that! I do also wear a mask and wash my hands often when wondering outside of my office, but I keep my mask off on my air purified area ! I recommend it for small office spaces and imagine it would work great in bedrooms - I\u2019m unable to speak for larger areas. Great buy for reasonable price! I haven\u2019t used the infuser ontop because I have a separate air freshener, but I\u2019m sure it works great.",

Ya en 6 meses mas comprar\u00e9 los repuestos.El Purificador es de tama\u00f1o ideal, ligero, con materiales de calidad, resistentes, de textutra y color agradables.Dise\u00f1o sencillo de usar, simplemente lo volteas, sacas los filtros para quitarles la envoltura pl\u00e1stica, los vuelves a colocar, cierras, conectas, enciendes con un ligero toque y listo.MUY SILENCIOSO, no s\u00e9 porque otros compradores se han quejado, yo lo puse en la velocidad alta y casi no se escucha, mucho menos en velocidad baja o en sleep; realmente funciona sin ruido.Inicialmente lo puse por 3 \u00f3 4 intervalos de 25 minutos para no cansar tanto el motor de un solo golpey si, poco a poco fui sintiendo el cambio en el aire. Al principio produc\u00eda un olor t\u00edpico de pl\u00e1stico nuevo, pero horas despu\u00e9s ya se fue disipando.Ya por la noche lo dej\u00e9 en la velovidad baja por tiempos de 1 o 2 horas y si duerme uno mas c\u00f3modo, el aire se siente ligero, limpio, despierta uno con una sensaci\u00f3n de descanso y una respiraci\u00f3n mas completa y relajada.Lo \u00fanico que lamento es no haberlo comprado desde hace 30 \u00f3 40 a\u00f1os, porque cada d\u00eda la ciudad donde vivo est\u00e1 mas y mas contaminada y ahora me doy cuenta de lo importante que es tener un Purificador de Aire.",

                "reviewText": "This a great little air purifier for a small room. Its simple and modern styling means it doesn\u2019t stick out in your room and because of its small footprint, it doesn\u2019t take up much space. It\u2019s very quiet on \u201clow\u201d and barely noticeable when on sleep mode. The lights go off so it keeps the room dark and doesn\u2019t disturb me even though I\u2019m a light sleeper.The filters are easy to fit. Remove the bags and insert both filters, replace the lid and you\u2019re set.The air definitely feels fresher with this in the room, and less dust collects on the surfaceThe only downside is that it defaults to \u201coff\u201d when turned on at the plug so using a timer plug won\u2019t work with this machine. I tend to leave it on continuously instead as it only uses about 5w of power so it costs about 3p a day to run full time.These are a good enough price that I\u2019m willing to buy a couple of more for my office and living room",
