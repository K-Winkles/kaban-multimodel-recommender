                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with the air filter. I bought it for my bedroom. It has 3 fan speeds and yes you will hear the fan but it isn\u2019t an annoying sound or that loud. It has a nighttime mode for the lighting in it, which is nice because I don\u2019t like a lot of light at night. It also has a timer if you want to just run it for awhile. I have it sitting on my dresser but the floor is fine as well. Very well made.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought 3 of these off Amazon. Some have been gifts; and I am likely to buy at least one more.I am currently using 2 small ones on each side of the bed. They work very well together on low speed without having just 1 of them and running it on higher speed which causes more noise. I am glad that generic filters are now being offered at a lower price. The cap-1000 offers UV light protection to kill viruses and the smaller unit does not. .. It is still a great Air Purifier. Even if the UV light in the Cap-1000 stops working air filtering will still take place bc of circulation of the air through the filters in the Cap 1000 - only UV virus protection is affected. I guess that would be a customer service issue. I guess a person could look into buying a UV light for different rooms. Both of these Cuisinart air purifiers are of very good quality. I am sleeping better at night and my sinus issues from allergies are much better. The Cuisinart air purifiers also filter out odors. They have timers that can be set by touching the clock symbol by tapping it for each hour you want it run before shutoff. They are also easy on the electric bill... 5 Stars.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m typically not one to write reviews but am so pleased with this product I just had to! I have been in the market for an air purifier for a while since my last one died (after only 1 year)! I came across this Cuisinart one and since I\u2019ve had luck with their other products, I thought I would try it out. I am so happy I did! My daughter suffers from many different allergies including pet hair, dust, mold, and whatever else seems to be in the air! She takes medication yet still ends up with itchy eyes and sneezing fits. We have only had this air purifier for a short while but her eyes have cleared up and she hasn\u2019t been sneezing! This is the only change we have made so I have to give credit to the air purifier! Besides the main benefit of clearing the air so my little one can sleep better, the sleek design is also appealing. I really appreciate that Cuisinart doesn\u2019t only take into consideration the quality of their products, but also how it will look in your home. A few of the other features I thought I would mention that I\u2019m loving are the soft night light, the timer, and how quiet the sound is. This is a well thought out product that I would highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this purifier due to brand loyalty as I knew nothing about this product but love Cuisinart. Right away after opening the box I pulled this straight up and out then plugged it in. It was running in less than 5 mins! The replacement of the 4 sided cartridge is so easy. I won\u2019t need to worry though as they are good for 2500 hours of use. A red light comes on to let you know it\u2019s time for replacement. Super easy slide out and slide in the new filter assembly. I can wait to start getting some cleaner air in my home. The blue uv light will also add another level of purification. The control panel lights up nicely and is easy to understand. Super quiet I think fan setting 2 and 3 will be perfect for me. Speed 4 moves a lot of air so if it\u2019s in a really big room 4 would be a good choice and it\u2019s not very loud either, a big plus. Good luck on your decision. I hope I was able to help you with some needed info for your own decision.",

I purchased this because of the horrible air quality over the summer during the Canadian wildfires. I'm sure we will be having more of those events, unfortunately, so I finally bought a purifier. I may buy a second one if it helps.",
