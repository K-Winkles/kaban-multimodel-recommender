When you tap the power button to supposedly switch between low, medium, high, and super speeds it makes a beep sound but the fan does NOT change in any way. Either I received a faulty unit, or this is complete trash, and as another reviewer said, \"This is landfill fodder.\" Well said, mate.The only way to turn it off is to unplug it.The unit is also larger than it needs to be, which is really just a waste of plastic. No wonder this is the cheapest air filter I found on Amazon - my bet is it'll be discontinued if it isn't already, and soon deleted from the marketplace.Perhaps my biggest frustration is now I have to go out of my way to a Kohl's and stand in line for 15 minutes while I wait to return this junk. I miss the free UPS Store returns - Amazon should bring that back.",

                "reviewText": "Listen up, my fellow air-breathing buddies, because I've got a game-changer for you. This Air Purifier is here to rescue your lungs from the clutches of indoor pollutants and turn your space into a haven of fresh, clean air. Trust me, this little powerhouse is like having a personal superhero battling invisible villains for your respiratory well-being!Let's dive into the nitty-gritty details, shall we? This air purifier is specifically designed for larger rooms, making it perfect for living rooms, bedrooms, home offices, and even small-sized offices. It's like having a tiny air-cleaning maestro silently working its magic in the background. Now, let's talk about the star of the show \u2013 the H13 True HEPA filter. This bad boy doesn't mess around when it comes to capturing those pesky airborne particles. Dust, pet dander, pollen, smoke \u2013 you name it, this filter traps it. It's like having a vacuum cleaner for the air, ensuring you breathe in nothing but the freshest of fresh air.Also! This purifier boasts not one, not two, but three modes to cater to your every need. There's the Sleep Mode, which operates with a whisper-quiet hum, allowing you to snooze away while the purifier works its magic. Then we have the Auto Mode, which adjusts the fan speed based on the air quality, ensuring optimal purification at all times. And finally, the High Mode, for those moments when you need a turbo boost of air-cleaning power. It's like having a selection of speed settings for your very own air-purifying race car!Another thing I love about this purifier is its portability. It's compact and lightweight, making it a breeze to move around. Whether you're traveling and need a breath of fresh air in your hotel room or want to bring it from your living room to your bedroom, it's as easy as carrying a fluffy cloud. Plus, the sleek design blends seamlessly with any decor, making it a stylish addition to your air-purifying arsenal.",

                "reviewText": "I have this down in my family room near where I sit. As far as I can tell, it does seem to remove some order in the area, though not fantastically. I can still smell things coming from the kitchen for a while, despite having this right next to me. I assume that it just can't handle that level of odor permeating the room. As far as dust and stuff, I'd assume it's removing that too, but I have no way to really gauge how well it's doing that. It could just be that despite having it next to me, the room it's in is just to big for it to work at all. The other thing is that it's loud. The only setting where you don't hear it much is the lowest setting. But that's not very powerful. I have it set to the 3rd highest level and it's noisy, but at least the fan isn't high pitched at all and has a consistent hum, so it's very easy to tune out. Overall, I do think there are better models of portable purifier out there that I would consider first.",
