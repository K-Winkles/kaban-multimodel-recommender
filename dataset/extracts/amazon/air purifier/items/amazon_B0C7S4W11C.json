                "reviewText": "I already liked the Shark brand, but these features made me instantly fond of this unit. I can read the pollen count in a room! Pollen! I cannot start to tell you how important this is for me. When I turned on this filter the pollen count was a seven. A seven in a bedroom with the door typically closed. Yikes! The air quality was yellow on the unit and that surprised me too. My only concern is the odor unit that goes on top. I have allergies to many scents and this one is bad. I\u2019m hoping it dissipates or filters out or I\u2019m going to wind up taking that piece off the top. I think it\u2019s supposed to be some sort of linen fresh scent, but I am dreadfully allergic to everything like that. Then again, part of its performance may be that it can filter that out of the air also! The overall performance is nothing short of miraculous, and better than anything else I have used so far! The QR code is important. It goes to the website which leads you to any and every video that\u2019s important about this unit. Briefly watching those gave me the complete rundown on every option on this unit. Bravo! So well done! It\u2019s also a bonus that it can work as a white noise generator because that is also needed for that particular room. G Go ahead and order an extra it sometime this next week because I don\u2019t want to not have this running ever again. Worth more than five stars.",

                "reviewText": "This purifier is small but it is a workhorse. We have a lot of smoke int he area, and an exterior door in near our nursery. When the door is open too long the purifier picks up that there is smoke in the air and turns itself up to start cleaning. It is really quiet, but you can hear the fan going on the highest setting. But even then it is quiet compared to my GermGuardian air purifier. Another feature I like is the scent guard that neutralizes odors. You can adjust the strength of it, it does have a slight smell to it when it is being used, a fresh scent but some people might not like the scent it puts off.",
