DON\u2019T BE LIKE ME lol Open the hatch on the bottom, pull the filter out, remove packaging, then reinsert the filter. Boom. Strange sound disappears like magic. \u2728The auto mode setting and air quality laser sensor definitely work. When I turn my essential oil diffuser on in the same room the purifier light turns red (signaling bad air quality) and it audibly cranks the air purification up to high mode, so it\u2019s clearly sensing the diffused oil particles or mist in the air. I don\u2019t want the diffuser and purifier work against each other so I may have to alternate times or move one to a different room.The machine is pretty small and would be perfect for any small apartment. I lived in a 260 square foot studio in college and this is much smaller than the air conditioner I had to fit in that place. It\u2019s lightweight, much lighter than two arms full of grocery bags. You could move it around your house all day if you needed to. However, I\u2019m gonna keep mine seated by my kitty litter box to suck up those lovely little lion scents.The low mode is pretty darn quiet but the high mode is noisy, however I don\u2019t mind it because I like white noise/ fan sounds.I got this hoping it would help with my very annoying indoor allergies (dust mites, mold, cats & dogs) and to reduce the odor from my cat\u2019s litter box. I\u2019ve only been using it for 5 days near the litter box and I\u2019ve definitely noticed a reduction in odor, whether or not that\u2019s simply from increased air flow idk lol. I have noticed a slight difference in allergies, but that effectiveness could be masked by the fact that I let my pets sleep in bed with me and it\u2019s prime outdoor allergy season here in Michigan, which also plague me.Only con is that I haven\u2019t been able to find any replacement filters for this yet and the manual does not give filter specs or brands for when it\u2019s time to replace it.Overall, it\u2019s working for me so far. Seems like an affordable small space solution to some big problems. I will continue to update this review as time goes on. If anything changes I\u2019ll be back :)",

I don't understand how the auto mode is really supposed to work. We have a couple of these and when I put my air quality monitor next to it and pound the carpet to raise dust, nothing happens. See photo. I've had the dylos air quality monitor above 300 which is noted as \"fair\" air quality on the Dylos, and the Yiou does not kick into a new gear. We will be returning at least one of these since I'm in the 30 day window. Might keep one for a smaller room since the price is good and replacement filters are cheap. We will not depend on auto mode or air quality monitoring with any remaining units.",

                "reviewText": "I got 2 of these for my home and will likely purchase a third. My spouse is allergic to dogs so I got one of these for our bedroom and one for the living room. My house is just under 1100 sq ft and it covers majority of the space. I do run my EufyHome vacuum every day and my normal vacuum and mop every Sunday and so far my spouse has been good with his allergies. He did test the purifier and blew vape smoke into it to see if it would do anything and within 5 seconds, the lights turned red and the purifier kicked into high gear. I\u2019ve witnessed it do it when I blow out my candles in the house and also when I spray Lysol.It\u2019s nice and quiet. The feature to be able to turn the light off in our bedroom is also a plus to keep the room dark. We can barely hear it running. Same with the one in the living room.The third one I will get will be for my kids\u2019 bedroom, which is also where the dog sleeps. It has a slight doggie smell to it since the dog sleeps there also, so I think this will help in that room.A lot of the people that come into our house have said they can\u2019t even tell we have a dog because it doesn\u2019t smell like one, and I think it has a lot to do with the air purifiers. Our dog is also a Basset Hound, which are known to be pretty smelly. So, the comments on not even knowing we have a dog due to no smell makes me pretty darn happy.I almost splurged on a $300 purifier and I\u2019m really glad this came up as suggested from Amazon. I got a $20 off coupon to use so it was a steal. Super happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This air purifier is easy to use and the sleep mode is very quiet. There are different modes and timer settings. It also has a night light which can be turned off easily. I usually set it at auto mode so I don\u2019t need to check on it.I bought this air purifier because I noticed my dogs have been sneezing a lot. They go outside three times a day and whenever they come back in, they start sneezing here and there. I figured it\u2019s because of the pollen outside and the dust indoor. I turned the machine on as soon as I received it. The air quality sensor lights on both sides were yellow at first, then about 10-20 minutes later, the lights turned green! After a few weeks of use now, I do notice my dogs sneeze less now, so I keep it near my dogs\u2019 area on auto mode that way they have fresh air all the time. Overall, I\u2019m happy to have bought this air purifier!",
