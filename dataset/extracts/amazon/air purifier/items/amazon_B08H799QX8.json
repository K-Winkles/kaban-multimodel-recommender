We bought our first one a couple years ago and it\u2019s still working great. We usually keep it in auto mode but do turn the one in our bedroom down to low at night or when we\u2019re watching tv bc it\u2019s right next to our bed. The one in our living room never seems too loud because it\u2019s not right next to our seating. Since it\u2019s so easy to change the speed both with the app and on the filter itself, it\u2019s easy to set it to a level that works for you. The lowest speed is quite quiet and the top speed is a little too noisy for my taste. We buy replacement filters via subscribe and save. We don\u2019t have to replace them TOO often but they are definitely dirty when we do. The filter kicks into a higher speed when our windows are open (and also the time I burned something in the kitchen, ha).The filter seems extremely sturdy and well-made.",

                "reviewText": "Quite sleek and tall, this can be mistaken for a premium tower fan. But it does so much more than just blow air - it blows clean air that it purifies, while being able to connect to its app on your phone so you can control it with such if your the lazy type like me and don't want to get off your couch once you've sat down.What I like specifically about the Filtrete are all the smart functions and features, since how can you really tell any other air purifier from another if you're working better or not? But what was cool was when the house next door had their roofing redone and all that clitter clatter of about ten guys kicked up a bunch of particles and particulates in the air. The Filtrete was able to pick up on the air quality, and that helped me out a lot as I was able to close enough windows and turn it on full blast to help control my allergies, which it also magically did since I have the most sensitive nasal allergies.So for me from my own experiences, I'm glad to say both features worked for me, as well as being able to control the purifier with my phone, and for all that it deserves five stars. In the beginning I was hesitant since I feel the price was rather high, and how some generic brand purifiers this size could be found for half the price. But this is the second purifier I have had the pleasure to review, and both have turned out excellent, so I can vouch for the quality of this brand, which in the beginning I have never heard of and also thought it was a generic brand.",

About 2 weeks later I received a new air purifier. The company was very good with customer service.",

                "reviewText": "This is by far one of the best investments I've ever made. I suffer from chronic lung disease, and needed something to keep the air in my 1200 sq ft home clean as I live near the desert and the air is often dusty outside. I've had this air purifier for 8 months, and it has never failed to keep my entire home air pure, even though it's only rated at 310 sq ft. This is a very sensitive system. If I leave my patio door open for a few minutes, even on a calm day, I'll get an alert to my iPhone that the inside air is worsening. Same thing when I cook. I live alone, so for a home with small kids running in and out, could be challenging for this air purifier. But, if you have an ill family member that needs really clean, healthy air, this is the system you want. I also use high performance Filtrete filters in my central heat/ac system, which makes it even better. The app for the iPhone works flawlessly and gives you alerts when it's time to clean the prefilters in the unit, change the bio filters inside, and even tells you when its time to change your central heat/ac system filters. If you want, you can even have it automatically order new filters for you when it's time. It is a beautiful design, and quiet too. Highly recommended!!! Thank you, Filtrete!!!",
