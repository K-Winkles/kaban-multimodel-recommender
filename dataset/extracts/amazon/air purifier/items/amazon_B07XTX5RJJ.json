                "reviewText": "I should start by saying I am (unfortunately) experienced when it come to air filters. I have bought so many with amazing reviews and were EXPESNIVE, but when I get them, they blow out almost no air and make no noticeable difference in my home. This Bissell air filter is much different - when you set it to high, it really BLOWS and actually circulates the air around it. It is almost funny how easy it is to use - just plug in and turn the dial. I don't typically use the \"auto\" mode, but it seems to be very intuitive. The air quality sensor is pretty accurate - I will be cooking in another room and the numbers in increase detecting the cooking smells and particles. The filters are HEAVY DUTY. I am not sure if you can get them here on Amazon, but you can find them on Bissells website and they are not too expensive. It has made a difference in a few days with my indoor allergies.PROS: actually works and circulates a TON of air when on high. Auto mode which will increase fan speed if air quality drops. Beautiful design and actually looks good in a room. I like the cloth \"pre-filter\" on the front of the unit. I feel like it captures some of the larger / easily removable hair, dust, etc. which helps extend the life of the filters in the unit.CONS: Loud (see below). A little expensive but worth the investment. Filters are harder to purchase - not sure if they can be found on amazon. Heavy.WARNING: this filter is NOT quiet. On the two lowest settings you can barely hear it, but on medium and high this thing if LOUD. I do not really mind it as I almost see it as a white noise machine, but this this is pretty loud. You have been warned!",

                "reviewText": "I have a Dyson tower fan/purifier that I have been using to combat the smoky air created by the California wildfires. Despite running that purifier 24/7, I slowly watched my indoor air quality (as measured by the Dyson app) continue to deteriorate over the last several days. I noticed the decline in my breathing as well and then I started coughing. Things weren\u2019t good. The Dyson simply wasn\u2019t getting the job done.So I ordered this Bissell purifier. It arrived this morning and now everything has changed. It took 30 seconds to set up (simply remove the plastic from around the filters inside) and I immediately put it on full blast. My PM2.5 reading was in the 70s. Within 10 minutes it had dropped to 50 and the air quality readout on the Dyson improved from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cfair\u201d. In just 10 minutes! Awesome!So I left it on high speed for 2 hours and the Bissell particulate metric continued to drop down to 22. Then I set it to \u201cAUTO\u201d and it has stayed in the 20s ever since. I can breathe easily now and I\u2019m no longer coughing. Tada, problem solved! All thanks to this product..Here are some additional thoughts:1. NOISE LEVEL: This machine was quite loud when I had it on full blast. It would be really disruptive to keep it at that level all day every day. But the minute I switched it to \u201cauto\u201d the fan slowed way down - it is nice and quiet now, like a very low speed fan or humidifier. It won\u2019t be disruptive at all to keep this on auto all the time, even while sleeping.2. SIZE. It\u2019s big. About the size of a mid-sized suitcase. But unlike some other purifiers with air intake and/or fans in the back that prevent them from being placed flush against a wall, this purifier only has the the sensor in the back so you can tuck it away without issue. Big jobs require big purifiers. There\u2019s really no way to avoid it.3. SIMPLICITY: One dial. That\u2019s it. And one single readout that measures PM2.5 (the one for smoke). Zero assembly. Filter changes are simple. Filters are readily available and less expensive than many competitor filters. Everything about this machine is easy.4. EFFECTIVENESS: it works! Beautifully.I\u2019ve only owned this machine for a few hours and I\u2019ve already recommended it to two others. I couldn\u2019t be more satisfied.",

Looks good and works great. I was concerned about the noise after reading reviews but it is Really queit on low and on the other settings it sounds like any other fan, which is to be expected. My only concern is it only puts air out from the left side of the top. I am not sure if this is how it is supposed to be or something is wrong but i am still happy with the performance. The insides are rather simple and i dont see anything that would prevent air coming out both sides but i also dont see it being a problem with it only coming out on one side. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f over all i have decided it is not an issue and affects nothing. I have seen an immediate differance in my allergies (why i purchased) and it definately cleans the air of smells quickly! I plan to buy a 2nd one for the other part of the house. I kind of want the black one but the white one is a better buy as it cleans more sq ft and on sale is cheaper!",

Quiet on low, moderate noise and tolerable on \u201cmedium\u201d. It\u2019s quite loud on high, but very effective at reducing particulates in the air, very quickly. Then it quiets down again once the room is clear. The biggest flaw I\u2019ve discovered so far is the particle sensor which developed a super annoying high pitch whine. I disconnected the sensor for now and just running the machine manually. I\u2019ll reach out to bissell and see if they send a new one. It\u2019s meant to be removed/ replaced as evidenced by the door over the sensor and the JST connector. Easy to remove and replace. I wonder if I can get the part though? It\u2019s a decent air filter despite the major fail of the sensor, whining noise and the fact that I can\u2019t run it on auto (I know when it needs to be on high so maybe it\u2019s not a big dream as long as I\u2019m around.)",

                "reviewText": "*** UPDATE: I moved to a 550 sqft studio apartment recently, and this has really worked well in keeping my apartment air clean, especially with the smoke from the forest fires. Time to change the filters which costed me $75. I still think the cost is reasonable. I change the filters every 6 months. ***To be honest, I bought this because of Covid and I want to make sure I keep my home safe from airborne particles. This airpurifier takes up little space beside my kitchen island and another plus is that it doesn't look like a typical air purifier. Looks very modern. It works really well in the kitchen area for when I'm cooking. Detects right away when there's particles in the air when I'm cooking and I could hear it ramp up to clear the air. This is so much more effective than my exhaust fan in the kitchen. I tried to cook one night with lots of garlic, onion, spices, etc. I turned this up to maximum for the night and the next morning, I couldn't smell the garlic around the house! For someone like me who doesn't like any scent/smell, this is a god send.The filters also seem to be at reasonable price. That's one of the reason I chose this air purifier. It's also very easy to replace.Portability -- -this thing is light. I take it upstairs sometimes to freshen up the air upstairs. Upstairs is 700 sqft, and downstairs is the same.In it's lowest setting, it's a nice white noise -- about 44 dB beside it measured using an apple watch. Highest setting is 72 dB using an apple watch .Overall this is a great buy! I'm debating on whether I should get another one to have as permanent for the upstairs area.",

It is absolutely amazing, my allergies finally cleared up, it covers 1,000 square feet (more then double what other purifiers cover), it has 3 filters (one you never have to change - the exterior one, and the 2 filters that require changing, are only changed every 6 months or possibly longer (whenever the indicator light tells you to replace it), vs every 3 months with every other purifier. Plus be very aware, the cost of filters on most purifiers are between $75 to $150 per filter (something that unless you research the replacement filters, you would never know, and they all need to be replaced every 3 months, that would cost you a fortune!! The Bissell filters are under $30 each. The unit is well worth the initial extra money to buy. Plus the sound level, I barely hear unless I am standing directly next to it, and even then, it is a whisper. It has also reduced my dusting in my home by half!",

I think the Air 320 is a wonderful device as you get instant feedback of your air quality with the LED dot display on the front. It also has a re-washable pre filter which is sustainable and is a good first line of defence for purifying air. I recommend this product if you're looking for a good air purifier, as well recommend this over the Air 400 because of the reusable pre filter, same features at a lower price, and ability to purify up to 1000 square feet in an hour.",
