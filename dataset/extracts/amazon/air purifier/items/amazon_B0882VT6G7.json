                "reviewText": "I have been using this little machine for a month now and couldn't be happier. I have another air purifier in the house by a different brand that I was running all day now that we're working from home but my husband would complain of the noise, especially when he'd take calls, and shut it off mid-day.This new one by TaoTronics, even at full turbo runs on a low hum and can barely be heard by him (or me!). I run it on high to help eliminate the smells in the kitchen from grease, burned foods, or other food smells that I don't like permeating throughout the house. If I need to take a call, I like that I can switch the setting to \"sleep\" so that it can still run with less noise and I don't have to shut it off and forget to turn it back on. I have noticed a great difference in the clarity of the air. The light feature is nice and has different levels as well and gives a calming look.The look of the device is modern and looks high end. I prefer the small size as it makes it easy to leave in the floor or on a desk top without being overbearing. It was very easy to put together straight out of the box - be sure to remove the plastic from the filter before installing it - and the bottoms are easy to understand without needing to review the instructions. I highly recommend this device.",

                "reviewText": "Recently I bought several air purifiers for work, to use in various sizes of lab and office spaces, so did a ton of comparison shopping. This was one of the air purifiers I bought for a smaller conference room space. When shopping for air purifiers, I looked at a number of factors -- price, good air exchange rate for the intended room size, adequate sq ft coverage for the intended room size, low watts, low dB sound, at least 3 settings, air intake from all sides of the machine, and clean air flow out of the top.This TT-AP001 model fit the bill very well. It's priced very reasonably, especially when there is a coupon. Air exchange rate and square foot coverage were more than adequate for the room it was intended to go in. Note that it's better to get one with higher specs than you think you'll need, since air purifiers are measured at their highest setting, but you normally won't have it at its highest setting that much. Low watts is important to save on the energy bill. Low dB means less noise disturbance. I actually found this air purifier to be fairly quiet even in Turbo mode, which was a pleasant surprise and not at all common for air purifiers. Lastly, air intake from all sides ensures that the old room air will be drawn in from every direction and not just 1 side, while clean air flow out the top is the best direction for moving the clean air all around the room.Not that it matters so much for an air purifier, but this one is a pretty neat-looking (though admittedly not quite as nice as its big brother TT-AP005) with its staggered height air intake holes, and spiraled air flow vents. The matte black top and blue night light are soothing to look at. We never actually looked at it at night (since it was used at work), but somehow the light provides a comforting feeling that the air purifier is there and is actually working to clean the room air, which gave myself, coworkers, and visitors a sense of relief during these COVID times.The only thing this air purifier doesn't have that I wish it did, was a timer feature. But I think that's a matter of \"you get what you pay for\", as you're unlikely to find any other brand of air purifier with these specs and at this price point with a timer feature, and Taotronics does make other models of air purifiers at higher price points with additional nice features including timer (disclaimer: I also own big brother TT-AP005 for personal use in larger spaces of my house, and really like it).",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m glad I decided to get this one over others. Couple reasons behind that: I have been using Taotronics devices such as Bluetooth receiver and had a positive experience with those devices. I\u2019ll admit I was skeptical till the day I started using it. Big fan of HEPA since I have it in my Car as well.How it helps me with my allergies: I\u2019m allergic to dust mites, fine dust and various allergens in the air. Before using it, almost every morning, the first thing that happened to me immediately after I woke up is sneezing. (I had that my entire life.) After I started using it, it solved my problem. As a person that has been bothered by allergies my entire life, this purifier works for me. (To be clear, I\u2019m not saying it cured me.) We have a 1000 sq. ft living room and it almost covers our living space (sofa, tv etc.) and get rid of the cooking smell as well.Sound level: It\u2019s quiet. I am very sensitive to noise as well. The machine sits in my bedroom (at night) and it doesn\u2019t bother me at all when it turns on level 1. At level 1 speed, the fan volume is fairly low. Even level 2 sound is a minimal hum. Only when it\u2019s on level 3, then the fan volume is more audible, but still way quieter than a kitchen fan. Also has a sleep mode that turns off the device automatically. The blue LED is a good show-off as i'm into RGB lighting, but if you're minimalistic you can also turn it off!Energy consumption: I leave it on at eco mode all day every day even when I am out at work during the day (I am an essential worker during these stay-at-home times). Didn't notice any increase in my energy bill. In fact, I used less electricity compared to the same period last year, so I guess when it's at eco mode, it won't consume a lot of electricity.Odor cleaning: It works really well and surprisingly well. Once my room is filled with burnt food smell because I overcooked some meat in the kitchen. I turned the purifier on to level 3 for a few minutes, and the air was clean again. No more lingering food smell from the kitchen.Filter Replacement: It provides an easy access to the HEPA filter, by turning the knob at the bottom side of the purifier.Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to other buyers! This is one of the best air purifiers I have tried and comes with 12 months warranty and you can extend it to 30 months by registering on their website. This on top of 60 day return period is awesome for new buyers!",
