                "reviewText": "I purchased these about one year ago for a new house. They were on sale and a great price for two small air purifiers. They worked right out of the box, super easy to use, and pull a lot of dust and pet hair out of the air. I have a large dog and three cats so it can be quite dusty. They have multiple modes to make them quieter. I keep them running pretty much 24/7 in my small office and living room. I clean them with a vacuum to get the dust and pet hair off the filter, use a bit al all-purpose cleaner on the plastic cap, pop it back in, and it's good to go -- takes maybe 5 minutes for both. They're small and fit pretty much anywhere, even a night table. I plan to purchase more in the future for other parts of my house.",

                "reviewText": "I get allergies year-round, especially when the weather starts to change drastically. We live in an older building on the top floor with just one A/C Wall Unit for our whole condo. As one can imagine it can get pretty stuffy and humid in here quickly, especially when it is warmer outside. This causes us to leave the windows open a majority of the time. With that, my allergies start to flare up a lot because of the stuffiness being inside and the outside air coming in and it gets real bad. This includes watery eyes, stuffy/runny nose, and sneeze attacks. I\u2019m talking used tissues everywhere, constant sniffling, mouth-breathing, 10 sneezes in a row (with no breaks in between) bad. In addition, we raise a 2-year old cat who loves to cuddle at night when my allergies are at their worst (she is terrified of loud consistent sneezes).I couldn\u2019t take waking up in the middle of the night with sneeze attacks anymore and being unable to properly snuggle with my cuddle buddy, so I started looking for air purifiers (at a reasonable price). I needed something that would get the job done ASAP. Low and behold I came across this product, the Druiap air purifier. It seemed like a majority of people were satisfied with this product compared to other products, plus it was on sale for less than $50. I couldn\u2019t refuse a good sale, so I went ahead and purchased one to try it out.Best purchase I had ever made! We put the first one on the ledge of the kitchen bar window and started it up. After just a few hours I was able to breathe better than I have in a long time. It wasn\u2019t loud (almost unnoticeable) and the buttons were pretty self explanatory. I wanted to get a second one right away! My boyfriend thought I was over exaggerating (he does not get allergies like I do) and that maybe it was all in my head. How did I prove him wrong? He is a very light sleeper at night, so my surprise sneeze attacks always wake him up. At this point, we only had the one air purifier in the living room/kitchen. We tested out me sleeping in the room vs the living room with the window or sliding patio door cracked open and our cat snuggling with me at night. Of course, my allergies were more active in the room and once I got into the living room area my nose instantly started to clear up.To make my point even more valid, my sister visits from time to time and she loves her cat niece. The biggest issue is that she has very severe allergies to both dogs and cats. When she spends the night it is worse than mine. She came up unexpectedly at just the right timing when we were performing this mini experiment. She quickly noticed how her allergies did not flare up like they usually do. She was shocked when I told her it was the new air purifier we got that changed our lives (she will now be visiting more often than I anticipated). We ended up getting a second one after all for the master bedroom within the span of a few weeks.I am happy to report that I am breathing like I got a new nose and I can snuggle my lil furry baby every night without scaring her off. I just love how it counts down until a new filter needs to be replaced, how minimalistic it looks, and how amazing it really works. Still trying to convince my boyfriend to just get one in the second bedroom, his home office, so I can hang out in there more while he works from home during the week (he has not budged yet). Now that it is colder outside, the humidity is lower and my allergies are nonexistent for the moment. However, it is still useful for strong smells. We keep our cat\u2019s litter box in the corner next to our non-functioning fireplace (our bathroom is tiny and there was no other place to put it). Unfortunately, her litter box does not have the little door attached anymore since it kept locking her inside for some reason. Now she LOVES her wet food but it does cause her to make a more noticeable odor when she uses the bathroom (it was 10x worse during warmer days when it was stuffy in the condo). When you entered the condo, it really hit you in the face and no amount of cleaning could make it go away. Now we hardly notice the litter smell or strong odors at all anymore every time we walk into our home. Smells that used to linger from cooking are now gone within a few hours and/or just super minimal than before as well. For the price I got it at, it really can\u2019t be beat. This is a wonderful and miraculous product! Thanks for my sense of smell back!",

                "reviewText": "We bought this air purifier to give it a try specifically because we were close to bringing a baby home and wanted to have clean air and worry less of the condition of the air our baby was breathing. We had looked into a few other purifiers including the Hepa filter ones that everyone was purchasing due to covid, but the price on most was out of our budget. My boyfriend while searching found this purifier and decided to purchase it as it was in our budget and had pretty good reviews. All I can say is This air purifier works great. We keep it in our living room, as it\u2019s for a big enough space. We also have another one in our bedroom. We love how this air purifier has different settings, it also has a timer so you don\u2019t have to leave it running all day and all night, you can set how long you want to go on for. It also has a sleep mode, and a display screen that tells you the time and most importantly how clean the air is. We turn it off quite often when we\u2019re not home and turn it back on when we do get home and it\u2019s quite impressive how fast it works to clean the air, those numbers go down pretty fast, so we know it\u2019s working. Something that we also love about the purifier is that it doesn\u2019t make any noise whatsoever. As you can see on the image I keep my baby\u2019s swing next to it and he sleeps perfectly fine. He doesn\u2019t get startled, and is a also by our door that leads outside. That\u2019s how we know it works. Overall we are extremely happy with out purchase, so happy we ran into it. We highly recommend, especially if you also want clean air with no noise.",

It's easy to use, quiet and does a great job of removing pollutants from the air.",
