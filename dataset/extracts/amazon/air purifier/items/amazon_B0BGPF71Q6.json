                "reviewText": "We have 3 Levoit air purifiers in our home. We bought the Levoit Vital 200S with the add on smoke specialty filter to try to combat the smell from our chain smoking neighbors. So far it isn't able to completely remove the smell but it does cut down the severity some. It will clear the smell eventually provided the source stops for long enough. It's amazingly quiet on the lower speeds. The higher speeds are a bit loud but the fan moves a ton of air around. I'm disappointed that the auto mode doesn't detect the smoke smell but I can use the app to turn it to high speed as soon as I smell it. You don't have to use the app but it's really easy to set up and connect. The app allows you to set schedules which is really handy and as I touched on earlier, it works as a remote control. As with the others, you're able to turn the lights off completely so it's good for bedrooms. We've only had this running a few days but I'm pretty impressed with what it can do.I initially bought the Vital 100 and put it in our bedroom because I have terrible allergies. It collected a ton of dust and helped a lot with the allergies. I thought I didn't need the smart version but in hindsight the availability of specialty filters and the remote control would be very helpful. It's relatively quiet although on high it's too noisy for me to sleep with. I absolutely love that you can turn the all the control lights off. We tried using this for the cigarette smell but it wasn't very effective except when the smell was very light. It did completely abolish cooking smells though. If I could go back in time I would have ordered the 100S instead but this one works fine.The smoke smell from the neighbors comes into our house through the laundry room which is a very small room. I bought the Core Mini to try to combat it. The Core Mini doesn't really do much to get rid of smells and was definitely overwhelmed by the smoke so now we move it around the house now when the pollen level is high. It works ok for dust and allergens but the range isn't great; you need to be right next to it to notice a difference. On low and medium speed it's barely audible and high is relatively quiet but overall the fan isn't very powerful. The lights on this one automatically turn off after a few seconds making it bedroom friendly. If I could do it again, I would have skipped this one and bought one of the larger ones sooner.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the LEVOIT Air Purifier, and I couldn't be more pleased with its performance. There are two standout features that have truly impressed me.Firstly, the small microfilter in the front is a game-changer, especially for pet owners like myself. It effortlessly captures pet hair and can be easily taken off and washed periodically. This feature not only makes maintenance a breeze but also ensures that the air purifier continues to work efficiently.Another remarkable aspect is the whisper-quiet operation during sleep mode. I was initially skeptical about running an air purifier throughout the night, but the LEVOIT model pleasantly surprised me with its almost silent operation. It creates a peaceful and undisturbed sleep environment, allowing me to wake up feeling refreshed.The efficiency of this air purifier in removing dust from the air is truly commendable. I've noticed a significant reduction in the amount of dust that used to accumulate in my room. It has made a noticeable difference in the overall air quality, creating a cleaner and healthier living space.In summary, the LEVOIT Air Purifier is a reliable and efficient solution for anyone looking to enhance their indoor air quality. With its user-friendly features, low maintenance, and impressive performance, it has become an essential part of my home as I now have three of them running all the time. I highly recommend it to fellow pet owners and anyone seeking a peaceful and dust-free living environment.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased an Inofia Air Purifier a few years ago and was very happy with it until they stopped making the filters. It became a paperweight as the filters were clogged and there was nowhere that carried the filters for it anymore. I purchased this filter 2 months ago and I am absolutely delighted with it. It is very quiet, you don't even know it is running unless you turn it on high. The automatic function works exactly as it is supposed to. When you are cooking or frying something you will notice the power light turn red and it kicks the speed up a bit. It is just cleaning the air. I have severe allergies Seasonal/Pet and was going crazy with allergy medicine and ever since I put this in my home I no longer take medicine everyday. You will be doing yourself a favor ordering this and the price is very reasonable for the build and quality of the machine!!!",

                "reviewText": "Ever since a certain something went legal in New York, my neighbors have been celebrating nonstop. Being sensitive to smells, headaches and migraines started happening. My sister suggested this purifier (her husband has lung problems & the doctor recommended it). It\u2019s amazing, it keeps the air clean and I smell nothing! I know it\u2019s the machine because when I leave my apartment I can smell the celebrations, but inside there\u2019s no smell. I leave it on auto & most of the time it runs on low or goes into sleep mode. It\u2019s very quiet and even at its highest speed it sounds like a fan on low. Can work from an app on the phone or Alexa or the controls on the device. Really was one of the best purchases I\u2019ve made.",

                "reviewText": "With two dogs and a bird it can get a little smelly in the house at times. This air cleaner fixes that problem right away and it's very quite about it. Smoke from cooking is detected and cleared away almost instantly too.It was very easy to set up and easy to clean the pre-filter. It just snaps right out. setting up the app was easy but as with everything now it's 90% selling you services and other devices and 10% controlling the filter. But it does that really well with a lot of other features available to you. It can also be connected to an Alexa device if you have one.The only thing I don't like really is it has a little click at low fan speeds, like the fan is hitting the side of the housing or something. It's not bad but just enough to drive you crazy if you are sitting close to it.All in all I would recommend it.",

Finally, my son has no further problems with stuffy nose and is able to breathe much better. Where have you been, so wish I had purchased your units years ago. Thank you very much, this has made me one Happy Mom!!",

Took a bit to learn their software, but if you look carefully (swipe upwards on air quality screen very gently) it will show you what/when it is detecting. Matches our cleaning. and/or breakfast making (attached).Super great, actually works, measurable, bought 2 now. Feel it's an amazing, actually working product !!!We use the 100(s) for the upper bedrooms, and the new 200(s) for the main floor near the kitchen.It also has a great 'auto' mode, and a light sensor to turn off the LED display at night.SUPER well thought out design, and makes a notice difference.Filters last nite a while... very reasonable. Enjoy !",
