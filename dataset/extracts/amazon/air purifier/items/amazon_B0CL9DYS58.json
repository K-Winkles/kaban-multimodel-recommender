                "reviewText": "I got this today and I'm already feeling a difference in my bedroom. I have similar units in my home but I really needed one in my bedroom. We have indoor/outdoor cats and we live in a very dusty area. It can really affect my breathing even with frequent vacuuming and dusting. This unit is quiet but not silent. It is smaller than my other units, but you can really feel it moving the air. The carbon filter and hepa filter come as a single piece, so cannot be replaced separately. The unit only came with one filter. The cord and plug have a nice little storage cubby in the bottom of the unit when not in use. However, I will be running mine around the clock. The control buttons are touch sensitive instead of buttons. Sleep mode turns off the display and lights and puts it into a very low power mode that is extremely quiet. I love this as I am a light sleeper. There are 4 fan speeds controlled by the fan icon. The next icon is the automatic function. This will detect the filtration level needed in the current space and turn the fan speed up or down. There is a timer function that has various settings between 2 and 24hrs. It also comes with a UV filtration feature that claims to kill bacteria in the air. My first impression is that this is a well made and powerful air filtration system. There is a noticeable difference and you can feel the air being moved in the room.",

It has a display that tells you what the air quality is at the time; blue for great and red for bad. I have bought several air purifiers in the past and this one seems made of much better lasting quality. I would highly recommend this product to friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "The air intake on the machine is in the BACK. I hate that, really. It should be in the front instead. If you flip it around and have the air intake facing in the room instead of on the wall, you can't see the display, This has a DC motor which means this uses less energy. It has 3 speeds, L, M, H and uses 10, 20, and 30w on those speeds. You will never notice this on your electric bill even if you left it on high, 24/7. On my bill that would be about $3 a month taxes included.The most concerning issue I have is finding replacement filters. It's not like a brand name that you can run into Lowes or Target and pick up some filters for this. The machine is quiet, the LCD is bright and it has a timer and UV light as well along with a sleep mode. In sleep mode, it is nearly silent and only uses 5w. If you can find affordable filters and the price of the machine is good, I would buy it.Unless you have smokers in your home, I find the recommendations for changing filters are excessive and unnecessary. You can vacuum the dust off this flat filter every few weeks and then it should last you 2 or 3 years on the same filter.If you hate to dust as I do, this helps.",

                "reviewText": "I have 4 air purifiers, including a white one of the same brand and model. This make and model is by far my favorite! I breathe easier, it doesn't take up much space, and I love that it displays an actual reading of the air quality. It works great even when up against the fur of four indoor cats. I prefer the black one because it blends in well with the rest of my furniture and doesn't stand out too much.I am very happy with this and would definitely recommend it to others. My only issue has been finding replacement filters. It has been a while since I looked for them, but it is definitely something to keep in mind.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As indicated in the video portion of this review, I have four other purifiers and honestly, this Afloia blows the others out of the water as far as looks, features and filtration. I have one that does read out the parts per million but the thing is a really tall and very obtrusive. This Afloia is elegant looking, feature packed and highly sophisticated plus the filter is very easy to change, which is NOT true on the others I have.The changing colors meter for particulates is a highly useful feature. You could see that from across the room negating any need to walk over and look at it. It's easy, you plug it in, press the power button, press Auto and ignore it. Take a glance once in a while and see what color the bar is. If it's blue, you're good to go. If it was red, I'd probably take it out of auto and set the fan speed on high until the air clears out from the offending particulate contaminants.Highly RecommendedFive Stars * * * * *",

It combines the best features - auto mode, a digital readout showing the level of particulates in real time, and even an internal UV lamp to kill bacteria, fungal spores, etc. (particularly appreciate this feature).Set up is very easy. Pull out the filter and removed the protective plastic bag, pop the filter back in, plug in the machine, power it up, push the \"auto\" button, and let it run. The included manual is very complete (see photos of selected pages). Five stars!",
