                "reviewText": "I received my Bissell purifier just over two weeks ago. I was impressed with the simple, minimalist packaging - the unit was well protected but did not come in excessive amounts of packaging. The instructions were easy to follow, and the unit was able to be set up in a matter of minutes from receiving.The unit itself is very sleek and modern looking, it doesn't have the industrial plastic look of some of the other models on the market. It blends into both my office and bedroom well without sticking out, and is small enough to be placed on a nightstand, dresser, or can stand alone on the floor.The unit has 3 different speeds. My only note is the highest speed is a little loud for an office, but it works great as white noise to sleep to. The middle speed is barely able to be heard, and the lowest setting is completely quiet. The unit can also have a night light turned on with two different brightness levels, or it can be completely dark.The filter on the unit is very easy to get to and change. I have already noticed the Bissel Air Purifier helping my allergies, and I wake up each morning feeling less congested.Overall, I am very happy with the unit, and have considered getting a second so I can keep one in both my office and bedroom instead of moving it back and forth.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this purifier. It has a sleek look so it doesn't stick out, and is a good size ( not too small or too large). It works really well. There is no noise on two lowest settings and the highest speed has a fan sound but it isn't obnoxious. People expect no noise at all which is weird because I have never seen any kind of fan that is completely silent. The only down side to this is the price of the filters. Especially when they need replaced every two or three months.",

                "reviewText": "I receive the BISSELL MYair+ Air Purifier just before a weekend away. Upon my return, I noticed my apartment smelled of mildew and dust after just a few days without fresh air. I decided to set up the purifier the minute I got home, and much to my surprise, it was so simple to start! The instructions are concise and use helpful images to show you what you need to do before turning it on - which basically consists of removing the plastic surrounding the filter. Once that\u2019s done, you just choose a spot and plugin! We chose to set it up in our living room. I was nervous about the noise it would make as we read, work, and watch tv in that area, but it is so quiet. It\u2019s barely audible. Actually, I had to turn it on and off a couple of times to make sure it was actually working! The BISSELL MYair+ Air Purifier is sleek and modern and I appreciate the neutral grey color. It sits like a small piece of furniture that is easy to overlook, but pleasant to spot when your eye does land on it. A few hours after set up. I realized the mildew smell was completely gone and the air (combined with an AC unit) felt fresh and light. It\u2019s common in an old apartment to actually feel the air. Humidity and dust can settle like a fog in those small spaces. With the BISSELL MYair+ Air Purifier, I can hardly feel it at all. My only problem with the BISSELL MYair+ Air Purifier is that now I need one more for our bedroom!",

                "reviewText": "I have only had this product for a couple days, but I can tell it is working already. One thing my wife and I like about it is it's design. This item can be displayed for all to see as it has a cool design, but is compact enough to tuck away. Also, it works really well. Within a couple days my wife and I have noticed that the air in our living room has \"freshened up\". When living in our own home you get accustomed to your house smell. We have definitely noticed a difference. Also, this machine is very quiet on the medium setting. High is a bit too loud for our liking. This would be a great white noise machine for someone, just not me. All in all this is a great product!",

I have respiratory issues that are service-connected. I can\u2019t find a way to do anything about the cigarette smoke coming through my vents, but this air purifier has been amazing. I used to wake up and feel like I had been at some hole in the wall bar all night. Like back in my 20s. \ud83d\ude02 Now this air filter clears the smoke smell out of my bedroom fast as I sleep and I wake up to no cigarette smell in my hair. I have noticed it\u2019s helped my dog as well because she was waking up with serious eye boogers because of this smoking neighbor and now those have minimized tremendously. When the neighbor isn\u2019t smoking in their apartment this air purifier works so well that my bedroom smells like when I\u2019ve lived out in the country and could smell pure fresh country air.",

I really like the style of it, and after getting it and taking it out of the packaging, I'm happy with my purchase.Couple of things to note:--IF you don't read the user guide, make sure to take the plastic wrapping off the filter before you use it--I had to turn it upside down to get the bottom back on after taking the wrapping off so I could align the 'unlock' & 'lock' - a little finicky, but didn't take long--I like that it has a night light and a USB port to charge your phone--It has three levels, level 1 and 2 are pretty quiet and level 3 is a bit louder but it's almost like a natural sound machine for the baby's room which I likeIn short, I recommend buying this air purifier if you're looking for something for a bedroom or smaller room.",
