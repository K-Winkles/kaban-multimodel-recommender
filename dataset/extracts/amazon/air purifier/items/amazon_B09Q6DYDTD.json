                "reviewText": "11JUN23 - Received the Clarifion plug in air purifier today. Immediately read the instructions, plugged it in my bedroom, and set it for high. Before I go to bed tonight, I'll relocate it to my living room. I like the blue light; the sound level on high (to me) is quite bearable. The item was well packaged but it did come in a larger box with other items I had purchased from Amazon. I paid $35.84 with a 10% discount for anyone comparing prices. Since I only just received this, I'll write another review in a few weeks to let folks know how this mini air purifier works out.18JUL23 - Noticed a price jump to $39.99 and no discount today. Been using this Clarifion DSTx purifier for a few weeks now and it has worked better than expected. I do not have allergies but I do have a dry cough that would occasionally wake me up in the middle of the night. I've been using this unit in my bedroom and would run it on high, with the higher blue light setting, from the time I woke up in the morning to about 10pm at night. Then I would unplug it from the wall and go to bed. I actually sleep through the night without coughing. I don't know how to explain that there is a distinct difference in the air quality after this unit is used. The air smells fresher and, after taking a really deep breath, it's like the inhaled air reaches all the way down to my toes. Doesn't make sense, I know. However, this mini air purifier DOES work quite well and I do recommend it highly. Since you're probably asking why do I unplug it before going to sleep? The first few days I let it run all day and night. Then I went back and read all the reviews. Well, a lot of those reviews stated some folks experienced smudge marks on the unit as well as their wall outlet and showed photos as proof. I got the impression that folks were letting the unit run 24-hours a day, 7 days a week most likely on the highest setting. Because of the smoke drifting down southward from the Canadian wildfires, I can see why this unit was run constantly. But since I didn't want to experience any smudges nor take the chance that this unit would burn itself out, that's why I turn it off, unplug it from the wall, and let it \"rest\" until I plug it in the next day. I'd rather be safe than sorry, but the unit does work and I want it to last a good long while. Good seller, highly recommend this unit.",

                "reviewText": "I've been surprised and pleased with how well this works. My office is 6x8 with 11ft ceilings so 528 cubic feet and that's what this unit is designed for. I would always have a weird smell from the carpet and our janitor started using a very high potent floor cleaner that would just knock me out, but this made everything okay. I really like it a lot. I used to work at IQAir and know a lot about air filtration. Was very skeptical about this unit, but it exceeded my expectations. I've been using this for about 3 months. It's a little loud.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This air purifier is a must have for the house and travel. While its not for a large room uts perfect for a bedroom, bathroom or any other room in the house where you want to help with allergies or just filter and purify the air. My husband and I were getting allergies from a lot of remodeling happening in our home, when I heard about this small air purifier we knew it would be great for all our bedrooms. Its been the best purchase of the year! Within a day our home smells better, our allergies started to clear up, and it\u2019s super cute and easy to plug in and move around the house. My daughter likes the nightlight feature, which you can dim or even turn off completely within the two different fan speeds. It is a bit bulky when you first open it but once plugged in it looks sleek and ends up being a conversation piece when noticed by friends and family. I also love that we can take it when we travel to use in hotel rooms which never seem to have great breathable air!",

                "reviewText": "I started noticing my allergies after we got our dog a year ago. She sleeps on the ground right next to my side of the bed and I was waking up sneezing and congested. The Clarifion plug-in air purifier has made a significant difference in how I feel in the mornings. I plug it in right next to the dogs bed and I have not had those allergy symptoms at all since I started using the purifier just over a month ago. Not only is it effective, but it is compact and has multiple settings (light, no light, quiet mode, high speed, low speed). I have also used it in the kitchen after cooking fish, plugged it in after dinner and couldn\u2019t even tell fish had been cooked the next morning. Highly recommend!",
