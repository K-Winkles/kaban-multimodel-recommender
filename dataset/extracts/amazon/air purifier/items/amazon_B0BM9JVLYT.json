                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this air purifier with double-sided inlets and I am extremely impressed with its performance. I have been using it for several days now and have noticed a significant improvement in the air quality in my home.The double-sided inlets are a unique feature that allows the purifier to draw in air from both sides, which increases its overall efficiency. This means that it can clean the air in a larger area much more quickly than other purifiers. I have a large living room and this purifier is able to handle it with ease.One of the things I love most about this air purifier is how quiet it is. I often forget that it's even on because it is so unobtrusive. The sleek design also makes it a great addition to any room in my home. The touch panel controls are easy to use and allow me to adjust the settings as needed.Another great feature of this air purifier is the automatic mode. It detects the air quality in the room and adjusts its speed accordingly. This means that it's not working harder than it needs to, which saves energy and extends the life of the filters.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of this air purifier. It is efficient, effective, and easy to use. The double-sided inlets are a unique feature that sets it apart from other purifiers on the market. I would highly recommend this air purifier to anyone looking for a high-quality solution to indoor air pollution.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the white. Like the look. Like the 2 filters. Really only hear the fan on medium and high. Night mode is very quiet (almost silent) and the light dims. Very easy to operate. Has many options such as night mode, auto, low-med-high fan, child lock, filter reset. Only thing I do not like is that when you push the button to turn it off, the light blinks (I guess to let you know it's off), but I would prefer it to not blink. Liked it so much I bought a second one for another room shortly after the first purchase. FYI - air quality is the number on the front and when I googled it, websites say it should be 12 or below to be good air quality.",

It detects smoke and automatically kicks into high gear or you can put it on manual mode or night mode, where the lights turn off and it gets super quiet. The double filters are something you don't see in other purifiers of this price. I have used it only for a couple weeks and liked it so much I bought another one.",

On days when the air quality is in the unhealthy range it is a relief to see the air in my room is well within the healthy range.",
