                "reviewText": "This air purifier seems to work well. I ordered it mainly to remove pollutants and allergens, and these are typically odorless so I can only assume the unit is working as intended. That is, I can't say the air smelled any fresher or cleaner.I like the white color and smallish size. The product description says you can toss it into most carry-on luggage to take with you, but honestly it's a little too heavy and big for me to seriously consider doing that. I could see taking it on a car road trip or packing it into your RV, but I personally wouldn't fly with it.The unit is definitely whisper quiet on the lowest setting, tolerable on the medium setting, and downright loud on the highest setting. So if you're expecting quiet operation on all three speeds, that isn't the case. I plan to keep it on the lowest setting during the night when I'm sleeping, and use the other settings when noise isn't a concern.The product description says this cleans 857 sq. ft. in about an hour, but it doesn't say which setting. I assume on the highest setting it cleans that well, so I could have used more information about how long it takes to clean that area on the medium and low settings.Which brings up another question: How do you tell when you're done and can switch off the unit? In the interest of saving electricity and prolong filter life I'd want to use the unit only until the area was \"cleaned\" instead of having it running all the time. I wish there were some sort of indicator light or gauge that would let me know the current cleaning status. This is my first air purifier, so I don't know if this feature is available on any air purifier. Maybe you just have to guess with all of them.All in all, I'm pleased with this unit and expect that it will perform as promised.",

                "reviewText": "I've been running this in our bedroom for a few weeks and really like it. It is extremely quiet at medium and low settings and easy to sleep with. I haven't really tried high but believe it may disturb me trying to fall asleep.Our big Lab sleeps in our room and spends plenty of time getting filthy dirty. The unit helps with the odors and the air is overall much improved - even on the low setting with the door open.It's a relatively small and unobtrusive unit which is nice. For it's size, it packs a nice punch and is a great way to improve the air quality of a bedroom or similar sized room.",

I wish it has UV to kill germs but it is fine for your dust clearing needs. I like it.",

The number of times you press the button adjusts the fan speed. We had it unboxed, registered, and running in less than 15 minutes. You just have to make sure to remove the bag around the hepa/carbon filter and lock the base back in place, plug-in, and purify. The manual suggests changing the filter every 6 to 12 months, which Amazon also carries and right now they\u2019re only $16 (regular price is $22, which still is very reasonable). When you register the product you can opt in for a free1 year warranty. I am very happy with this air purifier, so much so that I plan to order more for other rooms in my home,",
