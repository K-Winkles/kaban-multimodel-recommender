                "reviewText": "I wanted to wait on writing a review until I had actually had the chance to use it and compare the changes.First some back story, My boyfriend has really severe seasonal outdoor allergies and is allergic to my cat. VERY ALLERGIC. Since the cat was here first though, the cat isn't going anywhere =^..^=. I just moved into my new apartment and I waited about a week before I brought my cat over. In that week my bf was over and he was mostly ok with his allergies. AS soon as I brought my cat and he was there for one day, the allergies began (thankfully the bf doesn't live with me). Now I am very clean person. I vacuum the carpet and furniture in every room everyday and wipe down all surfaces. My cat gets bathed 2-3 times a month and brushed daily with the hopes of keeping the pet dander and fur to a minimum. It just didn't seem to be enough though.The cat was in the apartment for about a week before the unit arrive and within a week you could tell the apartment was starting to develop a 'smell'. It wasn't necessarily awful, but you could smell that people (my roommate and I, with guests and cat) were occupying the space. The smell of feet after a long days work would hit your nose as you entered (shoes are off at the entrance) and the range didn't do much for removing lingering food odors.The unit has been running on high with the UV light on for about 2 weeks non stop and there has been a notably MASSIVE improvement in the entire apartment in smell and allergies. Before, my bf would walk in and within 5-10 min the allergy symptoms would start. The itchy watery eyes, sneezing, swelling of the nose and throat, mucus; the whole enchilada. Now he can comfortably be in my apartment for hours and not be completely miserable. He has even spent the night several times now! The first place I set the purifier in was the living room. Although its not recommended for that much square footage it really did make a difference. Within 2 days I noticed the smell of occupied space had completely disappeared. It was running on high for about 5 days before my bf mentioned there was a notable difference in air cleanliness in the living room. Afterwards, I moved it to my bedroom; as that's where the cat spends most of his days sleeping, and again within 2 days the air was pure enough for my boyfriend to be able to spend the night. I still vacuum everyday and wipe down all the surfaces to continue the reduction of allergens, but this air purifier has really been a godsend to him and the apartment.I wont go into too much detail on how to use the machine, since there are plenty of other reviews that do. Once you slip the filter out of the plastic the magnetized lid pops back on and just plug n go. I love that the purifier has many different settings based on your needs, such as duration, speed, sleep and UV. The replacement filter reminder probably being one of my favs as I tend to forget everything. The low setting is insanely silent, the medium is but a whisper, and the high is a great low white noise or standard fan sound. The High setting really moves some air though. I opened the unit the other day to check the pre-filter and I was astounded by how much cat hair and my hair was stuck to it. I lightly vacuumed it and let the unit resume its duty.The unit is a perfect height (about 4 inches below the knee) and so aesthetically pleasing. It seamlessly blends into the apartment no matter where it is placed.This air purifier works like a dream and I'm very happy with my purchase. The only complaint I have is that there isn't a larger sized unit approved for bigger square footages as I'll have to go with a different brand and do more research. Hope this review helps!",

                "reviewText": "This was just delivered today, 04/13 & after 4 hours, on the 2nd setting, we noticed it was working! We made a pie & baked some french fries & there's no lingering food smells, which usually stays around into the following day. BTW, the 1st & 2nd fan settings are Super Quiet!!! Didn't have to turn the TV volume up. The 3rd setting is a little louder, so we use that setting as needed & run it for a shorter period of time; higher settings will always be louder in any air purifier. We got the gray color & it blends nicely with our living room furniture. Another nice feature, besides the design & being compact, is the HEPA filter only needs to be changed every 6 months. (We had a big box store air purifier that required changing every 2-3 months & those filters were expensive).Will buy another one where the cat boxes are kept. With an increase in the frequency of summer & fall fires nearby, tons of allergens in the air, pet dander, food smells, etc., every household can benefit from an air purifier(s). Thanks PURE!",

                "reviewText": "Works great! We have two large dogs that shed a decent amount. I usually vacuum the floors about twice a day and Moo the floors regularly to reduce dust and dander from the dogs since we have allergies, but there seems to always still be a lingering dog smell around the house which leads us to use plug in air fresheners that usually bother my allergies as well. But, this unit made the air feel and smell so clean! After a full day of running it in our open floor plan home I was able to unplug the air fresheners and there was no dog smell! My dogs are indoors and get bathed once a week so they don\u2019t ever get really dirty (except when they go on adventures but they get baths after that). Even after cooking, the unit was able to get rid of any food smells within an hour or so. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with pets and allergies. It\u2019s easy to use and move from room to room. In the lowest setting it\u2019s pretty quiet and we had no issue sleeping with it running during the night.",

                "reviewText": "Updated: There isn't a big difference between the lowest speed and the middle speed so I take the rating back to 4-star.Original: This air purifier is HEPA rated. It can be set with a timer, and has a built-in UV-C light sanitizer. The pre-filter can be cleaned easily. The warranty is good for 5 years. Just recently, this air filter stopped working. I contacted Pure Enrichment, and they sent me a replacement promptly. The unit looks very elegant, but at highest speed, it's somewhat noisy.I updated the review from 4-star to a 5-star. The only gripe I had was that the unit was somewhat noisy at the highest speed, but the new unit that I just received is quiet at event the highest speed. Good product with a good warranty coverage.",
