                "reviewText": "I\u2019m Huge on air-purifiers, I have 4 at home.What's NOT Included: For $250 it's a bit expensive for these not included.-A remote!!! You have to purchase as an add-on accessory.-Indoor Temperature, Relative Humidity displayed-VOCs, NO2 sensors (not a deal breaker)-It does NOT oscillate but the fan is very strong.-You cannot monitor air quality or remote control device via app. It\u2019s not WiFi-connected.What\u2019s Included and my review:I\u2019ve had the purifier on auto-mode for 4 days in the bedroom and my office. I feel pretty firm on how I feel.1. It didn\u2019t have clear instructions - just a quick start guide. You will need to scan the QR code for full instructions.2. The touch is very responsive and impressive.3. A dust screen to protect the HEPA filter, similar to any other air purifier (in my opinion-ie Honeywell, Dyson). Extra external \u2018cage\u2019 to catch dust and needs to vacuumed but should notify you when.4. This HEPA filter is not reusable, nor washable, it will need to be replaced and its suppose to last 5 years. It needs to vacuumed. I will absolutely come back and update how long the filter last. One of my non-brand purifier filter lasted 4 years by vacuuming. I\u2019m sure this will too, if maintained.5. The Odor Neutralizer - it smells like floral and unnatural. I immediately had a headache opening it in the package. I put it in, left it in for 30 on \u201coff\u201d but the smell still lingers on off mode. Giving me a starting headache during my work day. I took this out. It\u2019s similar to an air diffuser. Not a fan.I noticed how clean the bedroom/office was within the first hour comparing to my Honeywell. very Impressive. Amazing air detection- your cooking, he toots or he hits a pen in the other room, this thing kicks on max gear auto mode, in between 3 walls in my apt. Its amazing.MAX fan moves the air very well in the bedroomCONS:Its loud. MAX is as loud as the fan in bathroom or stove fan. It\u2019s very notable loud when it switches fan settings.What\u2019s even more annoying is the fan on auto when it switches back and forth. Its like the sensors are uncertain meaning whatever setting your looking at ex: air quality percentage.. it\u2019ll drop to 83%-yellow at medium fan, then switch to 86% at MAX fan. The fan switches back and forth, the percentage goes up/down/up down until it stabilizing. My Dyson is constant and fan decreases, as it cleans the air and quieter.Cannot fall asleep or difficult work when it suddenly switches back and forth! But you get use to it.I tested this when I was cooking dinner, we compared to my Dyson, please see pictures for more info. It\u2019s pretty much 1-1 almost (not AQ!)I don\u2019t know if others experience the same cons. butI love love my Dyson purifier. I'm really in love my shark vacuum.and I like this purifier. I wish it had the temps displayed.2 week Update- as an air purifier I\u2019m very satisfied with the overall AQ. I don\u2019t need my inhaler as much at night (I had the 6 year honeywell in here). Plus the screens to collect dust\u2014 I removed these after 2 weeks exactly running it on auto, you\u2019d be surprised with how much it collected!! Impressiveair suction.I\u2019ve gotten used to the fan noise when I\u2019m sleeping.During work it\u2019s kinda noticeable without background noise.I have walked into it a few times since it\u2019s on the floor lol.It\u2019s great, but expensive. I still like it (a lot now) \u2014impressive AQ.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've been using this air purifier for a few weeks now and it is a great product and very accurate.This air purifier is amazing. It will measure three particle sizes: PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 and you look at the main display on the front and you can cycle for a reading on what it is reading in the air for the three particle sizes or an overall general clean air score from 1% - 100%.There are filters on the side that need to be cleaned that will catch hair and other larger debris.The air purifier will read the air quality continuously in auto mode will adjust the power to clean if it senses the air quality has degraded.For background - I have another air purifier in the house and when there is smoke from cooking or other particles in the air, it kicks on high to clear it. This air purifier is in another room and when the other air purifier kicks on to clear the air, the Shark also notices particles and will display it on the front and kick on higher to clear it.When you plug this air purifier in it is very quick to come back with a reading of air quality and adjust power accordingly.This air purifier is very quiet on it's normal mode. If the air quality degrades the fan will kick on higher to clear the air and at that point it is louder. You are able to take the air purifier off auto and adjust the speed as needed.If you use this air purifier in your room at night, you can adjust the brightness of the display to bright, dim and off. This is awesome if you love to sleep with a dark room but you still want an air purifier to clean the air.The box said it comes with a remote. The product description doesn't say it comes with a remote. I reached out to Shark, who sent a remote at no cost, but it was not the correct remote for this unit and did not work. So I'm not really sure if it has a remote made for this unit?It doesn't connect via WIFI or to an app but I'm not sure that is necessary.I did NOT use the odor cartridge. It has a bunch of warning labels on do not touch it with bare hands etc and when I did open it, the scent was very strong. I decided not to use it at all in my unit.Overall, I love this unit. I think it does a great job reading air quality and cleaning the air.",

                "reviewText": "We've got 3 dogs and I was looking for a way to reduce the smells in our living room (the room we spend the most amount of time in). This air purifier has done a great job with that. It's pretty quiet, even when the fan is running. It was easy to set up and get running. I like that there are mesh screens you can brush off or vacuum off, to get rid of any big stuff (like dog fur). And the \"never change\" filter looks pretty great. I was hesitant to get an air purifier before, because the maintenance requirements seemed cumbersome. But this is very easy.My only complaint is the odor neutralizer packet has a scent that reminds me of cheap bathroom air freshener, from a gas station or fast food bathroom. It's not a very sophisticated scent. I'm hoping maybe there are other options I can buy to replace it when the time comes, that will smell a bit nicer. Even a standard vanilla would be better than this scent.",
