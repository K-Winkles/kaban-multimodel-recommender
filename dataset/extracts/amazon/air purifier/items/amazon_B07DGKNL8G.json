Adding moisture to filtered air can help relieve allergy symptoms, stuffy nose and sinus congestion. Helpful to relieve dry skin and reduce asthma symptoms by clearing mucous from airways. Super-efficient evaporative humidification makes for a more consistent humidity level and won\u2019t over-saturate the immediately-surrounding area.",
            "TWICE THE AIR, HALF THE TIME: With a dual suction system the Revive is able to move through more air faster than comparable sized machines. Moving air through dual True HEPA filters, that remove 99.97% of particulates and allergens larger than 0.3 microns, makes your air cleaner and fresher so you can breathe easier. Dual intake also creates better airflow, the Revive will refresh the air in a 627sf room 3 times every hour.",
            "ACTIVE CARBON AND SPECIALIZED FILTERS: The Granulated Carbon Filter traps and removes odors, harmful gases, and VOCs. The Off-Gassing Reduction Filter effectively removes invisible substances like formaldehyde and VOCs that contribute to \u201cSick House Syndrome\u201d and can cause health and respiratory issues. Other Specialized Filters are available for purchase separately.",
            "EVAPORATIVE HUMIDIFICATION: With the Evaporative Humidification Method, the water particles used to humidify the room\u2019s atmosphere are small and light-weight. The smaller particle size can travel through the air more easily and efficiently, providing an even humidity throughout the room. Evaporative Humidification is self-regulating, as the room\u2019s atmosphere determines how much water evaporates from the humidifier into the air.",

The self-regulating Evaporative Humidification Method utilizes small, light-weight water particles to evenly humidify the room. The water tank holds 3.5 Liters of water for a full day of humidification. Auto-Adjusting Humidifier Both a Humidifier Filter and a Humidity Sensor work together to control the amount of moisture released based on the room's temperature and humidity level. Four Operating Modes In Auto Mode and Eco Mode, the air flow speed is automatically controlled based on the air quality in the room. In Allergen Mode, the fan speed automatically goes to maximum, quickly removing pollutants in the room. In Fan Speed Mode, or Manual Mode, the fan speed is set to your liking, regardless of the air quality in the room. Air Quality Indicator The Air Quality Indicator is a light that changes color in real time to indicate the air quality of the room, as measured by the Air Quality Sensor.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this last year and are still happy with it. It's cut down considerably on how much dusting we have to do, even in spring pollen season, as well as stuffy-winter-house smells. While it's a little bigger than we imagined, it's light enough to move to different rooms when we have visitors.We loaned it to our sister-in-law when her son (vaxxed and tested, but ...) visited, and she liked it so much she bought one for herself. And we just got a second one for ourselves to cover more of the house.And it's quiet. Mostly it runs at medium speed, but even at high speed, it's still not loud - you're just a bit more aware of it.In the dead of winter, when the air is super dry inside and out, the humidifier isn't quite enough on its own, but perhaps the second unit will help with that.",

Also, the water tank is very poorly designed as well - when filling, the rounded top slides in the sink and I have to wrestle with it each time I fill it so it won't fall and crack or empty the water - very hard to hold.

Now that it is cold and dry weather I would like to be able to use the humidifier but I cannot find the replacement filters. Amazon used to have them but they are currently unavailable and when they do have them they\u2019re extremely expensive. So I have a $500 system that is worthless to me!!!",
