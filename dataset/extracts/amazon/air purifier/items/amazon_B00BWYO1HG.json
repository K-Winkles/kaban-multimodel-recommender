The pre-filter should be replaced every 3 months for optimal performance. 3. The HEPA filter continuously captures up to 99.97% of the particles that pass through it - as small as 0.3 microns. 4. Cleaner and fresher air is returned back to the room. Easy to Maintain Replacement Filters The Pre-Filter B (model HRF-B1) needs to be replaced every 3 months. The HEPA filter H (model HRF-H1) should be replaced once a year. A filter light reminds you when to change the filters and they are easy to replace - no tools required. To ensure stated product performance, use only Certified Honeywell Replacement Filters What is Particle Pollution? Airborne particles less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter are so small that they can get into the lungs, potentially causing serious health problems. When inhaled, larger particles (2.5 microns and larger), tend to stay in the upper respiratory tract. Fine particles (2.5 microns or smaller) stay airborne longer than larger, heavier particles which increases the chances of being inhaled. These microscopic particles are considered more harmful because they can move deeper into the respiratory tract.",

These HP HEPA air filters enable her to avoid taking allergy pills. The HPA060 is great for smaller rooms. We also have an HPA200 and an HPA300. We keep them positioned in different room around the house. We have three cats, and they mean the world to us. With these filters my wife is able to breath normally, even when the cats are around and active.Can go about a year on the HEPA filter. The charcoal filter will stop neutralizing orders after a few months, but it still works well as a pre-filter for particulate. We vacuum it off once in a while to extend the pre-filter life. Filters are not that expensive, after market filters are available too. Operating cost is low. Noise levels are tolerable. They are pretty quiet, with multiple speed settings when cleaning is more important than quiet. We are finding we do not have to run them constantly.They clean the air of both particulate and orders very effectively. When the sun is coming in just right and you can see all the particles in the air, turn this on and you can watch the particles get sucked in and the air clears up in minutes. My adult son's room used to smell pretty bad. Now, with the HPA60 running in there a few hours once in a while, there is no odor in there.",

                "reviewText": "This is great little true HEPA air cleaner. It will sit nicely on a nightstand and looks modern. The packaging was excellent and it says it is Energy Star compliant.ME:- Light sleeper- Sleep apnea- PTSD (combat vet)- Severe allergies (I get weekly shots)- Owner of two cats that sleep on the bedLIKES:- It works. The air in my bedroom smells cleaner- On \"high\" it literally pushes a lot of air...I mean a lot- True HEPA paper filter and prefilter foam- Indicator lights to detect when to change both filters- Effective even on \"low\"NOT SO GOOD:- Wish I could leave it on \"high\" at night...but it is too loud (sounds like a small vacuum cleaner)- Woke me up one night...strange up/down fan sounds (I am an extreme light sleeper)- Have to run it on low at night and still have to have my other fan on to sleep.- Don't think it will work very well on rooms larger than a master bedroomOVERALL:- Does the job and cleans the air of pollutants to include smoke, pet dander, allergens, and funky smells. I need \"white\" noise while sleeping, but this machine is actually too aggressive sounding when on \"medium\" or \"high\" setting. Other than that...great product/price",

                "reviewText": "My room is small and oddly shaped, and very very old. Think early 1900's post earthquake San Francisco old. The carpet is gross and I can only imagine what kind of stuff is in the air from the surrounding city.Not to mention, I don't have the inclination to dust. I vacuum some, but not as often as I should.So in picking an Air Purifier I went through a lot of research and options. Ionizers were out because of Ozone and that I'd have to replace the light bulb, plus so many said that it simply doesn't even work. Germs are not my problem anyway, dust is!I would wake up morning after morning with my sinuses struggling until I got moving outside on my way to work and they cleared. It was then that I realized I had a problem.Enter the Honeywell, at a great price-point with included permanent filter (just have to vacuum it once in a while) and a charcoal insert pad. You don't have to buy the overpriced HEPA pads either if you're willing to cut the charcoal to size from larger ones.To me, that's perfect! I wanted something average cost, low maintenance. But the most important part... does it work?I can say YES, at least for dust. I do not have pets or allergies but since this is catching so much dust, I imagine it would catch those as well. It works by sucking air in over the charcoal pad, through the permanent filter, and blowing it out the other side. Within one day of constant use I could see some dust build-up on the filter and, maybe this was placebo, I think the air in my room smelled cleaner as well.If I had to make some points against it, and they are minor, it's that the size is not suitable for any large rooms. Mine is small, so it's great! The dial has several settings which have names like 'germs' and 'allergen' but really just mean low-high power. I'll have to see, down the line, if the lights telling me to replace my filters actually work.If you'd like to modify it you could add scented things to the place between the filter and the charcoal, I imagine.Now I wake up breathing easily and not scratching my eyes in irritation. More than I expected from Honeywell, I'm glad they delivered.",
