In fact, I am now able to breathe through my nose when I sleep. I do not have this unit for 2 weeks. It is very quiet on sleep mode. I sleep with it on #1 fan, and it acts like a slight bit of white noise. This has been a game changer for my sleep and comfort.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this long enough now to judge it. I have no complaints. It was super simple to set up. The instructions are clear and it's made to be easy. Filter slipped right in, locked into place and it was ready. I set it on Auto (a feature I highly recommend you look for) and haven't needed to do anything since. I hear it speed up from time to time but mostly I don't know it's even running. Good size, nice looking (if it has to live here, that's a plus) very quiet. I'm not sure what else you want. All in all, a good buy. I would let you know that the filters aren't cheap (for any purifier) so look around for the best deals. Definitely a good purchase. I recommend it.Update: I still love this unit. The update is the filters. These filters are not easy to find. There are 2 sellers here that have them, but keeping them in stock seems to difficult. I'll add the links and suggest you grab them when they're there.https://www.amazon.com/PUREBURG-Replacement-Compatible-ClearAir-A2-High-efficiency/dp/B0C1N1MFH8/ref=pd_ybh_a_sccl_3/140-3338014-2494630?pd_rd_w=HR4VB&content-id=amzn1.sym.67f8cf21-ade4-4299-b433-69e404eeecf1&pf_rd_p=67f8cf21-ade4-4299-b433-69e404eeecf1&pf_rd_r=MTS6KEBD066BPA43MM3C&pd_rd_wg=XkC4M&pd_rd_r=412e4957-830f-4349-a4ae-13cb77f3abee&pd_rd_i=B0C1N1MFH8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4JML8W8/?coliid=I55I4TI9G665P&colid=2M10JJ5HDOQL2&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it",

I like that you can put essential oils in the little spot on the top, but it doesn\u2019t last super long because the sponge is so small. It is also kind of difficult to clean out the little oil part if you want to change the smell. If these things would not bother you, then this is a good buy. I wanted something where I could clean and reuse the filter since I am trying to go green, so I don\u2019t really advise getting this.",
