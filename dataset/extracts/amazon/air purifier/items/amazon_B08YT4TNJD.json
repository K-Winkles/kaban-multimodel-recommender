I bought it on 12/2022 and stopped working in September.It does not turn on or respond to any buttons anymore . It just stopped working in the middle of a night. It was not physically damaged as far as we can tell.We tried calling/ msging and emailing Afloia without any response.",

Nine months later, the unit stopped working\u2014 it would turn on for a couple of seconds and then shut off. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent a replacement free of charge! However, 2 months later the new unit had the same problem. We will not be asking for another replacement. Clearly this is not a reliable product, as we have followed all of the proper maintenance and use of both devices. Buyers beware! The rarity of a combined humidifier and purifier may be a clue that such a device isn\u2019t functional. We\u2019ll be purchasing separate humidifiers and purifiers going forward and will avoid this brand altogether. However, I give their customer service 5 stars for sending a speedy replacement the first time.",

I could go into a long summary relating to this support but, all I can say is the follow up offer to me was excellent. They are sending me a replacement unit, which is a different model, but one they suggest would work the best for my situation.. I will always be a customer of their products even if the price may be higher, as the customer service they offer is priceless!!!Thanks to Whitney who was the individual who contacted me.",

The bucket of water is fine on top but it proibably doesn't do much. Don't expect it to provide the humidification that you would get from a real air humidifier, so just buy both separately.",
