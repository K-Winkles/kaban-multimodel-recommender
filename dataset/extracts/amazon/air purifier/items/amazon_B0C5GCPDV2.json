The set up was quick and easy, less than 3 minutes for me total. The only part that was a challenge was the bottom was stuck and did not want to remove at first. I tried twisting it to unlock, but it would not budge for me. I had my husband remove it and had it set up and running quickly. The controls are easy to figure out for programing. I tried out all of the settings and really like the blue light feature. I left it running from this morning to this evening and noticed the difference in the air already. The air is clean and fresh. I like the option of the timer, but will leave it running as the fan does not disturb me, it actually reminds me of white noise which I enjoy and find soothing. Overall, I love the look, the customizable options and how quickly it cleaned the air in my room. Two thumbs up!",

                "reviewText": "This air purifier arrived very quickly and was an incredible value! It is the perfect size for our bedroom night stand and was not too loud at all on the medium setting. Perfect for helping to keep the air clean for my wife and the included essential oil sponge was a great bonus that my wife already had a use for.BTW I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about when he or she said there was no power cable included. Unless they legitimately did not have a power cable included, the power cable is stored inside the unit and you have to open up the unit and remove the plastic from the filter before you can use the air purifier for first use. After you do that you will find the power cord.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the size. And the filter actually makes the difference. I believe it works well. What seriously ruins it in my opinion is the incredibly loud high pitch tone it makes when you touch a button (even in the \u201csleep\u201d mode. Which makes the fact it turns its light off totally pointless because the beep is what will be disturbing you. It\u2019s really loud, especially in the midst of the night. It\u2019s a shame I\u2019m gonna return this over the \u201cBEEP\u201d alone but\u2026. (Update) two weeks laterSo I decided too keep it because the return is a hassle. And this air purifier has overheated and melted. I don keep it on constant only during night time while I sleep and today I woke up to a plastic smell and seen this thing had melted itself inside and on top. This is a serious safety issue I\u2019m lucky the thing didn\u2019t burn my house down while I slept.",
