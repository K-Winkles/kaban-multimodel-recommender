                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is now our 2nd Blue air purifier. I originally bought the smaller Blue 411+ for our bedroom and I was very impressed with how having that in our bedroom improved my lifelong allergies that I take a daily pill for. Prior to getting the smaller 411+ I would very often wake up with a stuffed nose. Yes, we do have 2 dogs but they are not allowed in the bedroom due to my allergies. I honestly didn't have high hopes for the smaller unit but after a couple days of it purifying the bedroom air, I noticed a huge difference. I began waking up with clear sinuses and the room smelled \"different\". Not a bad smell but maybe just NO smell? Anyhow, after giving the little Blue a good 30 days to prove itself, I knew I needed a larger one for our living room. This is also where our dogs (golden retriever and black lab) spend most of their time with us when they are inside. And having these 2 dogs and allergies doesn't make life super easy as cleaning goes. I have to vacuum daily or every other day (minimum) and will at times pull up what looks like a small dog inside my vacuum canister. Especially, when my golden is blowing her coat.Finally after comparing, I went ahead and ordered the Blue 311 Auto for our living room which is approximately 420sf.I also bought a separate filter cover that's shown in my pictures and an additional filter to have on hand.The unit arrived well packaged and without damage.It came with a main filter installed and a a light gray filter cover but tbh, I will use the light gray cover while cleaning and drying the dark gray cover I have on it now. I as I prefer the dark (name is actually Winter Reed) over the lighter gray. I also like the quality of the upgraded cover. It's a bit thicker and looks nice.The set up was simple. It's really just plug it in and go.I like that this unit has 4 mode settings and indicator lights to show air quality and when the filter needs replaced.I have noticed one time when out of nowhere the air quality sensor light briefly turned from blue to orange then back to blue.The light sensor color indicators and level info are Blue (good), Orange (moderate), and Red (polluted).The main filter change sensor is supposed to switch on after 6 months of use but I haven't had it long enough to confirm if that works yet.For maintenance, I do run my vacuum brush over the outer filter cover once a week to clean any dust off of it which, there always is. This was also an immediate indicator to me that this fella is doing its job!I will also run a damp cloth on the the plastic exterior at the same time just to keep it clean and in the best working condition.Noise Level:This 311 Auto unit has 4 modes.\u2714Auto Mode: (fan speed will change depending on the air quality it senses).\u2714Night Mode: (whisper quiet, low speed)\u2714Everyday Mode: (medium speed)\u2714Boost Mode: (fastest speed and very loud).Boost mode is like, wind tunnel loud! Way too loud for us to watch TV in the same room if it was on. But this mode is not for everyday use. The only time I've used boost mode is when there is a specific reason i.e.,dogs came in from rain or I may have cooked/baked something that has a lingering smell, etc. I would just turn it on boost for 10 minutes or so to dissipate whatever the odor issue may be.We typically have it set on auto mode or everyday mode and it's very, very quiet. I would say auto mode is more quiet or no louder than an average fan that's on it's lowest speed and everyday mode is maybe as loud as a fan on medium setting.\u25aa\ufe0fPlease see video I took of the different modes to show the sound difference between all four settings\u25aa\ufe0fI have now had this particular unit running 24/7 for about 2 months and we love it! We live in Washington State so when it rains and our fur babies go out for break, any \"wet dog\" smell is gone in minutes if I kick in the boost mode but everyday mode will also take care of that within an hour or so.Sadly, I also know fire season will soon be upon us for summer and I have no doubt both units will do a fantastic job at keeping the quality of air inside our home filtered, clean and smelling fresh during the seasonal bad air quality.We will be tackling a full home remodel next year which we'll be adding central heating and air but even then, I plan on keeping both these units up and running!Would I recommend this Blueair 311 Auto?Absolutely 100%.Summary: All in all, if you suffer from allergies/asthma like me, have animals, or simply a home without filtered air and are teetering on whether or not to purchase, go for it! You won't regret it! Personally, these air purifiers have honestly changed my life! I wish I would've found this company sooner! I HIGHLY recommend!If I must find something negative, I guess I would have to say their OEM filter replacements are pricey but this was not a deterrent for me. They also offer an auto ship filter service for a discount.I give this an easy 5 star!(I was NOT paid for this review and was not asked to leave one. I have no affiliation with this company other than being a new-ish forever customer)!Hopefully this will help someone!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these because I wanted one in the bedroom and one in the living room.Living Room - I have noticed a dramatic decline in Dust in the room. Everytime we Dust, it would take about 2-3 days to have a coating of Dust again on tables, end tables, etc... (We have alot of electronics in the living room & 3 dogs) Now it takes about 11-13 days to be visibly on the same level as before.Bedroom - When we wake up we noticed a big difference after the 1st night with it. Our sinuses were alot clearer and breathing just felt better. May be a bit bias and maybe I was looking for it and noticed it but, we have been with it for a couple months now and I am still happy with them.I sleep with noise from a TV and the living room one also has a AC in the window near it so, I may not be the best to determine the noise level tolerance. When it is Red and using the high fan to really clean the Air, you will hear it though but, to me that is just it doing its job. Doesn't really bother me even when watching a movie or anything either.In conclusion- Noise Level - perfectly fine to me- Maneuverability - Soooo Easy to move where needed- Cleanability - Cleaning the exterior cover filter is as easy as vacuuming and/or tossing it in the wash. Interior HEPA filter needs to be replaced to be cleaned and right now its about 40 bucks for a replacement but, at about 6 months a replacement I feel it is still worth its while.Honestly, will be getting 2 more when we finish the basement.",

I was finding it impossible to keep up with vacuuming and sweeping all the time with the dander and miscellaneous build up all over the house. We also had new rugs installed that took forever to de-shed, adding to the problem.We've been so happy with the filter as I've seen a dramatic decrease in dust bunnies, and the house smells clean- like paper or something very neutral.It is somewhat large, but it's the tradeoff we are making for an easier time keeping the house a cleaner, healthier place for my kids. I'd definitely consider another purchase down the road and consider buying one for our family that has more pets.",

This would help a great deal if they didn't nickel and dime to try and get people to pay for other systems. In addition they really need to change the controls for this device. It's terrible. Change it to either an electric or knob. The current control \"panel\" is a nuisance.In regards to noise, I don't find it bad. . BUT that may be due to the fact I always have fans and other devices on while up and about. Relating to size, the picture is quite deceiving . This particular model is bigger than it looks in the picture. I'm not complaining. I like the size because it helps clean faster than a small room only system.",

Its a lot bigger then the 411+ but the fan sound is just as quiet if not quieter then the original 411+. It\u2019s just the right size for the living room/kitchen. We always leave all of them running on second speed and you honestly don\u2019t hear them at all but the air quality is much fresher and cleaner. Cooking smells are gone within an hour and lot less dust during the winter months when the furnace is running and no allergies in the summer months. Would recommend any of the blue-air filters when they go on sale from time to time or even buy an warehouse deal open box one on Amazon as most of the time it\u2019s just a return that someone changed their mind. The only con is the original filters can get a little expensive but you can buy third party for a lot less if you choose too but I did notice a difference in the air quality from the original filters vs third party so just a heads up if choosing third party filters for any blue-air air filters.",
