                "reviewText": "I am amazed at the high quality and how heavy duty this air purifier is! It is good size, not heavy but solid and sturdy. The fin on top are th\u00edch and solid so I won't have to worry about the it breaking like some cheaper purifiers I have before. The overall design of this unit is awesome and it really has a lot of power to it.I love the 360 perforated intake holes around the entire unit for quick and efficient air filtering up to 2200ft\u00b2. The 3-stage filtration which includes a pre-filter, high efficiency activated carbon filter and H13 Hepa filter really make a difference in air quality when I have it on during strong smell cooking along with my pet in the house. My house was build in 1959 with old plaster and window and I was amazed with the amount of dust the machine collected and filter. At night, I moved it to my son room and it really help with me son allergies. He is not having stiff and dry sinus in the morning anymore.The unit is very quiet compared to others I have and the control panel on the top of the purifier is easy to access and view. The machine supports 4 fan speeds as well as sleep mode & auto mode that are very quiet at night.I love this air purifier and will buy another one. What a great investment, worth every penny for me and would highly recommend this amazing air purifier machine to everyone.",
