Only runs when it detects dust and ran after I made oyster stew so the house didn\u2019t smell like fish. Follow directions on how to set it up, set it how it told me, and never touched it again. Love the fact that I can wash filters or brush vacuum 2 of them so I\u2019m not storing tons of filters. Love it so much, I ordered another one for our other end of the house in our bedroom to keep dust at bay. And who wants a dusty bedroom. 5 stars with no issues. Easy set up. It does run loud when the dog gets the zoomies and stirs things up. Recommend this product as it\u2019s all but eliminated the dust on my glass top stove. No more wiping dust before I cook.",

The odor sensor is so sensitive,when I added a few drops of essential oil to a diffuser across the room, it activated the air purifier and nullified the aroma.I haven't tried to clean the filters yet (only had it for a month so far) but I bought this model primarily for the washable filters so I hope it goes as promised.The house truly smells like nothing when you enter. With two dogs, that is impressive.It is a bit loud on its highest setting so we have to turn the TV up a bit in that case but I still love it and would recommend it.",

No wasted money on buying filters. Only thing I don\u2019t like is if it losses power, or you have an internet failure or you unplug it to move it, you lose WiFi connection etc you must manually reconnect the unit to your WiFi. Having to manually reconnect to the WiFi is why I have it 4 stars.",

My two favorite things about it is when the purifier is set in AUTO mode, it goes active to clean the air as soon as it detects odors. Examples = Food, Cigarette Smoke or the lighting of a Fireplace. I have also noticed a significant decrease in the amount of dust in the house, and the fact that ALL of the filters are washable, is a huge plus. I should have bought this thing years ago.",

I ran it continuously and the air quality was great.In January 2024, all of a sudden the motor seized. For nearly $400 and it doesn't last a year? Piece of junk! I bought it because it said you didn't have to buy new filters. Well - save your money and buy one that is half the price and deal with buying new filters every few months. You'll be glad you did.",
