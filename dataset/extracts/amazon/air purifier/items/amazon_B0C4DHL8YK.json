Very quiet and the fact that you can add essential oils is a great perk.I put this in the room where the kitty litter is and it works great. I highly recommend! Just a note to pet owners, cats and dogs usually don't like citrus smells (lemon, orange, grapefruit, etc.) But just like us they have scent preferences as well. So if you're using this to control pet odors near a litter box you may want to do some research as to what scents animals like and don't like so you don't accidently repel your pet from their litter box or sleeping area. Or, of course, you may opt out of the use of essential oils in a pet area if you are unsure. Either way, it works great. I just know some people buy this because of pet odor so I thought I would mention the oils.",

Can smell it working now and I\u2019m in another part of my home! Like that it has a light than can be turned off if you dont like light shining at night! The light just makes the room just bright enough that you don\u2019t have to turn on your over head light to see! So far I liking this unit no issues worked great right out of the box! Would highly recommend! Just wish the other colors had been available on Amazon! Would love to have had the Lavendar one! When I hey ready to order another one maybe that color will be on the site! Really like the fan speed and the timer control! Can set for 2,4,or 8 hours or u can bypass and run it continuously! Great little unit",

I have set it up near my air return in my house on medium and run it for 8 hours during the day and 4 hours when I get home at night. I have not used the sent compartment where you can drop scented oils because I don't have scented oils; however, I do use wall-scented plug-ins and have placed this air filter near my air return and scented wall plug-in, I can honestly say this has moved the good smell throughout the house. I live in a small home, a little over 1000 sqft. but this size is perfect for my home. I highly recommend!",
