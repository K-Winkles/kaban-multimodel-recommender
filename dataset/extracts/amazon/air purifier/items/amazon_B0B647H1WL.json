                "reviewText": "Not battery-powered or rechargeable. Requires power from a USB port. Current draw is about 0.25 amp. Has a USB \u201cC\u201d port. USB \u201cA\u201d to \u201cC\u201d cable provided (approx 1m), but no charger or power source. In the pictures associated with the product description, the item is portrayed as running in a bedroom, office, car and living room, with no sign of a power cord. (see fifth picture)The video associated with the product description shows it quickly cleaning up smoky air inside a jar that I would estimate to be a about 2 liter volume.One push of the button turns the unit on, along with the multi-color night light. A second push turns off the night light, and a third push turns the unit off. There is only one speed.The unit is quiet, but you can definitely hear it running. It is not unpleasant, in fact it's pretty close to the lower settings on a \u201cnoise machine\u201d my wife and I use when we're travelling.Floor area is listed as \u201c36 centimeters per second squared.\u201d I'm assuming this means an area of 36cm^2 , which would about be 0.13 square meters, or about 1.4 square feet. In the user manual, the coverage space is listed as <= 10 cubic meters. It is possible that instead of floor area, they mean the flow rate is 36 cubic centimeters per second.The user manual recommends filter replacement every 6 to 9 months, but does not provide any information as to how to find a replacement filter. The filter does not have any marks or numbers. It is 5 cm OD x 6 cm tall. Plastic fittings on either end are about 3.8 cm ID. The text description does say that replacement filters are available. Replacement filters shown at the bottom of the product page appear to be for another product. It is not clear that they will fit this purifer. Assuming they do fit, they are $9.99 each. There does not appear to be any gasket or seal at the top of the filter, where it mates with the fan. Definitely possible for air to bypass the filter, especially if the filter becomes clogged.This will probably fit into a cup holder in most cars, but I'm not sure I'd use it that way. The air intake is in the bottom half of the unit. Putting it in a cupholder would likely restrict air flow.The bottom line is that the unit does work, it is relatively quiet, but only capable of purifying the air in a relatively small volume. It is not rechargeable and requires an external power source, I intend to use it in my small travel trailer, which has an internal volume on the order of 700 cubic feet, or about 20 cubic meters. I'll power it from a USB port on the trailer's 12 VDC system or from a USB power bank. I'm considering a second one to get adequate coverage.",

                "reviewText": "This is a bargain priced air purifier, and it works, but replacement filters are going to set you back $10 USD a piece. So where'd that bargain go?It's small size means it can only be effective in small spaces. Notice, it's a little over 5 inches tall, but in some of the pictures it has been photoshopped into, it looks significantly larger than that. They suggest you can use it in the car, and it is true that it would only be effective in a space the size of a car or smaller. But the thing about cars is that their doors open and close often, bringing in new batches of air each time. So if you are using this for allergens, it's not likely to help much in the car. A better bet for the car is a HEPA air filter on your car's AC system.Could it be effective in a bedroom, living room, etc? Nope, those spaces are too large. You'll want to invest in a heavier-duty HEPA air filter for such spaces. Is it worth $20? Sure, but it's probably not going to be a good long term investment once you start replacing the filter.",

                "reviewText": "This little air purifier is tiny. It measures just 5 inches tall and 2.25 inches wide. It's very quiet. When you turn it on, it lights up around the top inner part. There is a button by the charger where you can turn off the light so that's a plus if you're into a lit purifier. You have to have it plugged in to have it work so it's not a chargeable purifier. I'm using it in my study which is about the size of a small bedroom. I can't honestly say it's made any difference. I can feel the air out of the purifier but I'm not sure it's big enough to make a huge change. Overall, I think this is great for something smaller, as the description said, for a car or maybe a powder or small bathroom. It's just so darn cute though.UPDATE 3/11/2023: I meant to update sooner. I've moved the rating from 4 to 5 stars because this little thing can handle a bedroom-size study/office. I still love how tiny it is but now love it even more at how powerful it really is.",
