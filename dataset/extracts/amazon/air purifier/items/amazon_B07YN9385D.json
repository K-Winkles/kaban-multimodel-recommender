Does Clarifion require installation? Just open the box and plug it in! It starts working as soon as it\u2019s plugged in, so you\u2019ll have it releasing negative ions in less than 60 seconds. Will it work on any outlet? Yes! It works in any standard outlet, making it incredibly convenient to use in any room, even in hotels and offices! How noisy is it when on? It\u2019s nearly silent as it works, so you\u2019ll never hear it. Plus, customers love the discreet blue nightlight.",

Lasting less than 3 months, in my opinion, is not acceptable.I also find it interesting that the Amazon purchase site does not have a contact for the company that it is purchased through. I would prefer a new one be sent rather than a refund.UPDATE JUNE 1While Clarifion company refused to do anything (China). After a Lot of discussion with Amazon they finally agreed to send a new one and I returned the original. Thank you Amazon, you are the best and still provide customer service to your customers.",

                "reviewText": "Not sure if this thing does any good because the wall area around the electrical outlets are black!Following directions to remove the \"dust\" do not work. I will have to repaint the area.The ion cleaner is supposed to make the dust particles larger enough to stick to the surface then to bevacuumed or mopped up. As stated, the only dirt particles are on the wall and they are impossible to remove. I did not notice dust particles on the floor, only the wall. Also, the power indicator light is bright blue and it lights up the bedroom. I did removed from the bedroom and will try another room.",

                "reviewText": "We assumed this product would work for several years. Now, after less than 2 years, each unit stopped working - No more blue light. Customer support said the units should last 1-3 years...well, this fact was not advertised anywhere on the website. So, buyer beware. You could be wasting your money every year. We recommend doing more research and finding alternatives. Unfortunately, we didn't buy any warranty and no one will stand behind their product. What is our world coming too??? Very disappointing.",
