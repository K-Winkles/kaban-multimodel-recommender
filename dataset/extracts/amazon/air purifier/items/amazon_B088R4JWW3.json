                "reviewText": "We recently purchased the Afloia Max air purifier on Amazon. It has the digital readout version which changes colors and air speed according to how dirty the air is. We found out that we have the newly updated version (one without the holes shown on Amazon or talked about in the manual). Afloia Support helped us figure this out. They have told us that the user manual has been updated for the next batch of shipments, and the product detail page will be replaced soon. Afloia Support has been very quick, patient, and helpful with figuring out these changes and any other questions we have. We feel that we could get help anytime if we need it. We really like the unit. It looks nice. It is quiet on the normal setting, a bit loud on the highest setting. It has a night mode for bedrooms and such. It is easy to move around with the handle on top. Enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this air purifier April 2023 and I\u2019m really happy with it. I don\u2019t have a large home and my kitchen and living room is open concept so when I burn something the smoke is everywhere. This thing clears out all of the smoke really well. The light at the top is red when there is a lot of pollutants/ dust or whatever and I have a really old home and it\u2019s dusty and this thing has been helping with the dust. It doesn\u2019t help 100% because I need one in the bedroom for that reason specifically but it\u2019s awesome. It helps with odors, dust , food smells and smoke. It\u2019ll notify you when it\u2019s time to change the filter, the filter light is not on yet but I opened it up to look at the filter and it is definitely collecting a lot of debris and dust. I intend to buy a smaller one for the bedroom. Also, it provides great white noise for sleeping.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Afloia Air Purifier about nine months ago, primarily to improve the air quality in my open concept condo, which often felt stuffy and was prone to accumulating dust.Design and Build:First impressions were positive. The unit boasts a sleek, modern design that blends seamlessly with my home decor. It's not overly bulky, which is a plus given its capability to purify large areas. The build quality is sturdy, giving a sense of durability.Functionality:The true star feature is the H13 True HEPA Filter. Over the months, I've noticed a significant reduction in airborne allergens, particularly during the high-pollen season, the difference in air quality was palpable. The unit effectively removes pollen, and even cooking odors.Noise Level:I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet this air purifier is. This makes it ideal for use throughout the night. On high setting, its very loud but we get use to it.Smart Features:The air quality sensor and auto mode are excellent. The purifier adjusts its fan speed based on the current air quality, which is not only convenient but also energy-efficient. The LED indicator, which changes color based on air quality, provides a quick visual cue about the room's air status.Coverage:It's advertised for spaces up to 2,615 ft\u00b2, and it lives up to this claim. I tested it in different room sizes and noticed consistent performance. It's especially effective in my living room, which is about 1,000 ft\u00b2.Maintenance:The filters are easy to replace, and the unit reminds you when it's time for a change.Pros:- Excellent air purification with H13 HEPA filter.- Quiet operation, suitable for bedrooms.- Smart auto mode for energy efficiency.- Effective in large spaces.- Easy to maintain.Cons:- The initial cost is on the higher side, but it's a worthwhile investment for the quality.- The air quality sensor can be overly sensitive at times, triggering the highest fan speed for minor quality dips.- Very loud on high setting",

                "reviewText": "EDIT: the seller reached out to me and informed me that replacement filters for this unit are now available to buy through Amazon.The customer service has been absolutely amazing. I had already returned my unit since I thought I would be unable to maintain the unit properly after a few months. It looks like that won't be an issue any more now that they are on Amazon. They also sent me a brand new unit free of charge which I couldn't be happier with! They just really went above and beyond.Thank you!So overallSo this air purifier is amazing. However, after a couple of weeks I noticed that the replacement filters aren't readily available for purchase (not sure if they are discounted or just not available for me).If you have access to replacement filters, would definitely recommend this purifier. I would have given 5 stars otherwise. I am a smoker in a small condo. I can smoke close to it, light goes red pretty quick. I have immediate it and it takes about 12 minutes for the light to go to blue (aka best air quality).So all in all I really love this item and wish I could continue using it, however it just doesn't make sense if I can't buy replacement filters every 3-6 months as suggested.",

I live close to industry and fugitive emissions as they call it ( cement factory and Quarry )This unit works incredibly well and there is a huge noticeable difference in the air quality. Ive only been running it for about 2 weeks but wow so far it's great. The difference is noticeable Within minutes..The unit is quite easy to use and I love how it gives you a coloured indicator on air quality it's also light and easy to pick up and move. Im only giving it a lower rating on maneuverability because one of the tiny rubber nub \"legs\" came off but its easily pressed back into the bottem and seems to stick. I could see it coming off again if i was to rotate or slightly drag/move the unit without picking it straight up and down so i might add a drop of adhesive. Hoping this stays as effective in another month or two as it has been! so far so good and ive owned lots of air purifiers in the past and have another that's nowhere near as effective as this one.",
