                "reviewText": "I am not sure, Gentle Reader, what made me expect, upon looking at the photos, a device maybe three inches high, but I was considerably surprised\u2014though not, I hasten to add, in a bad way\u2014by the substantial bulk of this device, as seen in the photo above.I have, ever since I was a wee small lad, been plagued by allergies. You name it, I'm allergic to it: pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and almost every other airborne thing you can name. While I've only had it for a few days, this has, at least subjectivelly and purely anecdotally, improved my quality of sleep.Ah, sleep. Speaking of which, the manufacturer touts how quiet this air filter is, and that's true...when it's in low-speed \"sleep mode.\" It's considerably less true when it's in what the makers call \"turbo\" mode, which filters a lot of air but is...I'll be delicate and say significantly less noiseless.I don't understand why the makers of air-blowing gizmos, everything from computer fans to air filters, don't use asymmetric fans. These break up shockwaves and make anything powered by a fan much less noisy. If the makers actually wanted to prioritize noise reduction, a simple asymmetric fan would likely go a long way toward quieting this down even further...but I digress.That aside, it does exactly what it says on the tin, and quite admirably. I like it.",

                "reviewText": "We live in a very populated city, so the smells and the smog are strong at times, as well as a ton of allergens. I got this to try to improve the air quality of the upper floor of our town home. We have been using it for about a week, and I am noticing drastically less smells and fewer bad allergy days. The essential oil pads work okay, but they do not seem to diffuse into a very wide area.It is a little bit louder than what I had expected, but not terribly so. If you are a light sleeper, you might want to concider the placement and any necessary measure like white noise or being willing to turn it off at night.I don't know if this is the best air purifier for the price point, but it is getting the job done so we're very happy with it.",

The sleek light-weight design fits every office or home decor.I like its portability. I'm currently using it in my home office and it seems to be helping with the staleness, but I could easily put it on my bedside for a little quiet noise. I think you could easily use it in an office environment on the lowest setting without causing a disturbance. The higher settings do give off an audible humming sound. An auto on/off air quality detector would be a plus.The unit's aromatherapy feature is non-detectable, which is disappointing. I continue to add essential oils but the fragrance does not seem to be filtering. I'll continue to give this a try with the additional filters that were included with the unit. Overall, it's a good unit as an air purifier for the price.",

We're using this next to the bed. It's hard to tell how much dust and stuff it's filtering out, I guess after a few months I'll know more when I check the filter. For now I keep it on at high power when we're not sleeping, and low when we are (the high power setting is surprisingly loud).I'm not using the provided aromatheraphy pads.When I unboxed it, the instructions said to open it up to get the power supply (shipped inside the unit to save space). I was grumbling about how hard the top was to unscrew, but it turned out I was trying to open it at the wrong place. The place it comes apart is about half way down (see my picture). Easy, once I grabbed it in the right place.The only improvement I would make would be to give it a built-in scheduler, so I wouldn't have to remember to turn it up during the day. But that's asking a lot. The controls are otherwise easy to use.",

It comes with 12 aroma air pads but you still have to actually by the essential oil drops for them which I will do eventually but for now I wanted to see how the air purifier works on it's own. The cord is inside the purifier, I spent a few minutes trying to unlock it but didn't realize that it wasn't the very top circle which I thought you turn because it was like not budging at all. It's the whole white casing that turns counter clockwise to unlock.Easy to turn on with a press of the button. There are 3 settings for air control. The first setting is nice and quiet, the second sounds like a normal fan that is on and the third is quite loud actually. I used it on the 2nd setting as I don't mind the sound of a fan when I am sleeping. I think it works well for providing fresh air and will see how long the filter lasts before changing which the unit will let you know when that time is approaching. Looking forward to adding some essential oil to the pads and trying them out.",

He snores, and apparently, I do too, but I don\u2019t believe him. I hoped this air purifier would help remove whatever is causing us to stuff up. We also have a rescue dog who, despite not having lots of fur, sheds like crazy. We keep her out of the bedroom, but she sneaks in sometimes, and, honestly, her hair is everywhere\u2026hoping this helps!\ud83d\udce6 What's in the box?-air purifier-power cord- 12 spare aromatherapy pads-instructions\ud83d\udc4d Pros-The machine is very easy to set up and operate. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. There are three settings \u2013 sleep, cozy, and turbo. The sleep is surprisingly quiet, and we don\u2019t notice it at night, which is a good thing. The turbo setting is quite loud but is sort of like white noise, so actually not terrible. I use the turbo setting during the day and switch to sleep when we go to bed.-It comes with an aromatherapy option. You just need to add a drop of essential oil to the pad in the top (see picture). I haven\u2019t tried this yet, as I wanted to see how the machine worked without adding another element. I can see how this would be a very nice option.-There is a 5-year return/exchange service.-The filter is good for 1200 hours (less if you are a smoker, etc)\ud83d\udc4e ConsThe unit is a bit on the expensive side ($139.99) compared to other similar air purifiers. It is not clear what HEPA filter to purchase as a replacement. The description says HEPA 13, but if I search that, several different sizes come up.-I plugged this in for the first time in my bedroom and put it on high since I was not in there, so the sound was fine to be a bit louder. I returned to my bedroom about 9 hours later, and the unit had stopped. I unplugged it and plugged it back in, and then I discovered the USB-C that goes into the unit itself was bent. This is very odd since only my dog and I were in the house the whole time, and the doors were shut. I question why it occurred, and it doesn't really make me feel confident in the unit's power supply or the unit itself. See the last photo. I found another power cord and plugged it in. I checked on it every hour or so, and it was fine.\ud83d\udc40 My ThoughtsIt will take several weeks/more than a month to determine if this is working. I will update as needed.",

                "reviewText": "Air purifiers are a great way to improve the air quality in small spaces indoors, especially in winter when ventilation is limited. There are many things to consider when buying an air purifier, but the filter is the most important, and there are many other things to consider, from the construction to the design. This product uses a decent and affordable filter (KQ-31), has a plain design and a large number of air circulation holes to help improve air quality quickly. It's relatively quiet and shouldn't disturb your sleep in stage 1. This product is 100% identical to Airtok's air purifier. So everything is the same.The downside of the product is its weight. It's so light that it wobbles on the slightest bump, which I don't think is a good design center of gravity. Next, the lack of a timer and moods. The lack of a timer is the biggest inconvenience. It's not meant to be left on 24 hours a day, so it's inconvenient to check on it.",

He doesn't like it when I leave him alone in there for more than a trip to the bathroom or kitchen, and I am concerned with him breathing my second hand smoke. This air purifier has been just what I needed. It's on all night, and I bring it into the living room with me during the day. So it's running 24/7. It's been a little over 2 weeks, it's running without a hitch, and I haven't yet had to change the filter.It's extremely light, so very portable. Which is perfect for me as it travels up and downstairs everyday. The controls are easy: Short press the power button on and through each of the 3 fan speeds, long press off. The button is a touch sensor. It saves your last setting, so if you like it on medium, when you turn it on again it will be on medium. Low and medium settings are very quiet, high is alot louder. Though I'm used to sleeping with a white noise machine so it doesn't bother me, the noise on high might bother some people. The dedicated power block does tend to get a little warm on high, but nothing concerning- and certainly nothing even close to hot. It comes with extra aromatherapy pads, which are placed in a special section on top of the unit, accessible by pressing down on the circle. The aroma pad section doesn't get enough air flow to be very noticeable, though. It's design is a bit of a fail in my opinion.I looked up replacement filters here on Amazon. If you do a search for KQ-31 replacement filters you have 3 options. One for $33.82 with import fees and extended delivery time. The other is $45.99 available with Prime Delivery. Both of these options are dual packs. The last option I found was $66.60 for a 4 pack, included with Prime, but may have an extended delivery time. All prices current at time of writing. There may be more, but these are the three I found. I was just relieved that the replacement filters were easily found, and not too expensive.I really like the air purifier. We have dogs cats, birds, snakes, and one non smoker. This building was built in the 70's- all small boxy rooms with no air flow- and this unit noticeably cuts down on cigarette smoke in every room we put it. I would have given it 5 stars honestly, if not for the aromatherapy fail. I wish they wouldn't have even put it in- its a 5 star unit on its own.",

                "reviewText": "For the price I was expecting a little bigger and more powerful machine. For what its is, its not too bad for a desk use. Its good to use as a oil diffuser. Came with few pads for oil which is placed to on the top to spread the fragrance. Fan is pretty silent and has decent airflow if not the best.The filter is not fine enough to help with the smallest particles but should be good for larger allergens.I would have loves a washable hepa filter. This one is another expense to keep replacing. The filters are priced almost close to a new machine for a pack of 4.Another nice thing about this is the weight. Pretty light to move and place where needed. The combination of the oil diffuser and filter means you can get rid of coking smells atleast from a small area.",
