                "reviewText": "Air purifiers are useful for cleaning your home's air, managing humidity, reducing your exposure to air pollution, and generally keeping your home's air clean. They function by drawing air through one or more filters, trapping various impurities, and then re-circulating the cleaner air back into the room via a fan.My son's room has two dogs and an occasional smoker, so the air quality was poor, and it was hurting how I felt in my own home. I decided to give an air purifier a shot and hope for the best. This one is tiny enough to fit on his bedside table and is just what was needed.The purifier has a True Hepa five-layer filter, which is a key feature in these devices. The filter contains an activated carbon filter, which aids in the removal of pollen, smoke, pet dander, and air pollution. Purifying a 183-square-foot room takes only 12 minutes and can be done five times every hour.I like how easy it is to set up and how quiet it is because the schoolroom and office are right next to his room. It offers three speeds to choose from as well as energy-saving features. It's well-made, looks nice, works well, and is reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "I live in a house with 3 furry pets and have been considering getting a purifier for sometime now. I purchased these because it came as a set of 2 and has overall good reviews.I don\u2019t know how to accurately rate these because honestly I do not know if they are actually purifying my house. I can tell you they are very quiet. If you\u2019re putting one in your bedroom it is a very quiet hum. It does have a blue light it emits while on, so if you like pitch dark in your room, there is no way to shut this light off (without turning the machine on)After about a week of being constantly on, I shut it off to see what the filter looks like. It was still just as clean as when I first purchased it. Maybe that\u2019s normal.Personally, I like having them running, and am glad I am using them.",

                "reviewText": "I like the three speeds on the fan, including the sleep mode. I like the 360 degree multi stage(5) pleated filter rather than a 3\u201d opening with 3-4 varying sponge filters layered in. I like the running time choices although I plan to leave it running constantly. What I didn\u2019t like was the box that had been opened multiple times and haphazardly taped back with plugs and wires still attached. This unit was sold as new, not used. Obviously they both were in good working condition so that was just a matter of presentation, but still.",

I didn\u2019t want anything big and bulky cause I have a small bedroom. This is actually adorable the size is perfect, it\u2019s so quiet, nicely designed. I love the handle that is equipped with l; I can easily cart it around to different parts of the house depending on our needs.. it\u2019s amazingly lightweight. It auto turns off after 8 hours which is nice. It definitely has helped us both so much, I will be getting one for my office at work cause their is quite a few smokers so this will hopefully help with that. Absolutely recommend this .",
