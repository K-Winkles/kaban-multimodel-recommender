                "reviewText": "Initial impressions of this purifier are very positive. I'm not setup to test the actual purification abilities beyond an anecdotal indication that it seems to clear the air well. See the reviews on Smart Air (they think it works very well but is over priced), Consumer Reports (the 211 and the Classic 605 are their two highest rated units), and elsewhere. BlueAir is very well regarded in terms of actual cleaning effectiveness.For all the other features, here are some of my key decision points and useful tips:First, I bought both a 121 and 211+ - they have similar specs, except the 121 has a 400 CADR rating rather than a 350 for the 211. I was a bit surprised to realize that they appear to have identical motor and fan units - you can swap them back and forth, and they measure identical power consumption, and sound the same. This means the 121 gets the slight boost by simply being taller and holding a larger filter. More filter area would make for more efficient filtration, and a small boost in CADR rating.This isn't really a knock, it is just worth noting if you are considering both units. I would say the 211+ is the better value in this regard, the 121 is over $120 more expensive, has $20 more expensive filters, and only slightly more filtration capacity. If you need something just barely over the 211+ in filtration, only have space for one unit, and have a large open space, then the 121 makes sense. Otherwise, if you need more than the 221 provides, and you have a space that isn't just one big open room, then buy two 211+s - it is still a better value than most of the other comparable units, and two small units will filter an uneven space better than one loud one.As for noise, these are both very quiet units (same noise, because they seem to have the same fan). The background noise in my house measured at 38dB, and I measured on an iPhone running DecibelX, A-weighted, at 1 meter from the unit, horizontally, mic pointed at the unit.- Low - 39dB, just barely over the background noise. It is not obvious that the unit is even on.- Medium - 48dB, I can tell that it is on from around the room, but only if I listen for it.- High - 55dB, OK, now it is making some noise, but it is soft in tone, not rattling or whining. Still reasonable in volume, and easy to talk over. It wouldn't kill your conversation and if you sleep with a white noise machine it might actually be similar volume (our DreamEgg at mid-high volume is about this loud).Power consumption is as indicated on the package - 30W, 43W, 62W, as measured by my meter. Quite reasonable again given the ~400CFM the fan must be blowing.Small things to appreciate:- The unit is attractive and simple. It doesn't look like a weird 90's appliance with a bunch of random protuberances or shiny stickers. It is clean and Swedish, and would integrate with a lot of decor. The changeable pre-filters come with a light blue and a midnight blue, and you can buy others. Looks fine without it as well, pure white.- The overall construction is simple and sturdy - a metal box to hold the square (but flat folding) filter, and an upper box with the controller and fan unit.- Upward blowing and pulling from all sides makes for a lot of filter area - units that just pull in the side or front are going to have a lot less filter area for the same air flow - meaning more noise.- The button on the front is capacitive - touch to change between off -> low -> med -> high -> off. It is sensitive and easy to use - I change it with my toe while holding a baby.- The unit remembers the last setting if the power is removed and restored. This means you can use it with a timer or in my case, Home Assistant automation!- The LED showing the current speed dims to 10% after a few seconds - very nice - I'm usually forced to put black tape over everything I buy to dim the bright LEDs everyone uses.The unit does not include Wifi (pointless and risky), particle counters (not going to be accurate at these price points), a display (why does it need one?), or an auto mode (read the articles on Smart Air about auto modes - they are mostly useless and sometimes much worse than just setting a moderate level and letting the unit run all the time). Basically it has everything you want - quiet fan, large filter area, easy buttons, and nothing you don't want.It isn't the cheapest unit, but it isn't the most expensive either. Compared to very cheap units you get a quieter fan and a more proven filter technology from a vetted company. Compared to more expensive units you lose some (mostly useless) control features, and some options for multi-stage filtering or chemical canisters like you might see from a (8X the price) IQair. My inlaws have a Blueair Classic 605 and this unit is smaller and quieter, for only slightly less filtration capacity, at 1/3rd the price.All in all, an easy recommendation if the filtration capacity meets your space needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a review of the 211+ (not auto) product.I purchased this to take the place of a Winix 5500-2 that I moved to a smaller room. I did a fair amount of research before deciding on this model. I wanted something under $300 that could filter a larger room. Consumer reports and the Wirecutter both rating this model very highly (in the case of CR this model was only beat out by the Blueair Classic 6XX model and that one goes for nearly $800 right now and is only somewhat more powerful.The unit is very simple. It\u2019s a large fan in an attractive white housing with a slightly larger white plastic base that houses the main filters inside. There are two different colors of the washable external cloth filter in the box. You can use whichever one you prefer. My unit had a reasonably bright blue one and a dark gray one. It\u2019s nice that they give you 2 of them. They only give you one of the large internal filters.The power cord is attached to the back of the unit, so if you break it or a pet chews the cord, the whole unit will have to be replaced. That\u2019s a shame.The unit itself is made mostly of plastic, which makes it light and easy to move, but it won\u2019t stand up to abuse. If your kid sits on this, it will break.I find the size to be good. It\u2019s not really enormous, as some large room purifiers are, but it will take up more floor space than the Winix 5500-2 (but it isn\u2019t as tall).The unit pulls air from all 4 sides, so you can\u2019t stick this right up against a wall if you want the best performance. The clean air comes out the top of the unit.As for the sound at full power, a noise meter registers 64 dB right at the top of the unit wheee the air comes out. To put this into perspective, my Winix 5500-2 registers 74 dB at the air release when it is also on full power. The Blueair\u2019s sound is noticeable, but it is very even and is decent white noise at top speed. I haven\u2019t had a problem falling asleep near it. The Winix can be annoying at full speed.At the lowest speed for both the Blueair and Winix, they register at 42 dB measured from the same spot as before. You\u2019ll have a hard time hearing them at this level unless the room is really quiet.The Blueair really moves air well. At top speed, you can feel the air moving in all parts of the room. It will make the room feel a bit cooler. It is noticeably better than the Winix 5500-2 in this regard.Controls: there\u2019s one button. You tap (not press) it to control fan speed or turn the unit off. The top rim of the button lights up with a pretty bright white light to let you know the fan speed.The one thing I miss with the Blueair 211+ is there is no automatic mode. The Winix 5500-2 offers this and kicks the unit into higher gear if air quality is poor. It\u2019s not a deal breaker, but I do appreciate the feature so you can save money but still have very clean air. There is a newer version of this Blueair that does offer automatic mode with air quality sensing. If you want that go with the 211+ Auto model. The price difference wasn\u2019t worth upgrading, but you might catch it on sale.The Blueair does not have a remote control like the Winix 5500-2, and that I definitely miss, especially without the automatic mode.The cost of replacement filters seems about the same as other popular air filters and they offer a wide variety of colors for the external filter.A word about putting on that external filter. It goes on like a sock, but in order to stay in place, you have to put the filter material over the top part of the bottom white plastic unit. This means the filter will cover the latching locations where the top part locks into the lower part. I find this makes the security of the latching not as good, but it works well enough to keep the two parts together.The Blueair is not very heavy and I find it easy to move (though you may want to move the two halves separately if you find it awkward).As for air quality, Consumer Reports seems to be correct. It has done wonders for reducing allergens and smells. It also does this without the trendy but potentially problematic negative ion generation that some other filters offer. I find this to be a pro for the Blueair. I don\u2019t need more ozone in the room.I did not have any odd smells from this unit, even with my nose up close. Based on other reviews I may have gotten lucky or perhaps they\u2019ve improved the production process.All-in-all, I find this a great unit for the price.",

We've gotten so used to having no odors around the house that soon as we leave our front door we notice a wall of smell (smoke, cooking fumes from other residents, etc). It's very quiet, super efficient, the only drawback is the slightly pricey filter, but I'm more than willing to pay $140 a year (new filter every 6 months of continuous use/$70 per filter) for *actually* clean air.",

                "reviewText": "Blue Pure 211+ Air Purifier is an amazing product! There\u2019s almost zero assembly required. You unbox, put the washable outer filter on, you plug it in, and tap front button to turn on to start. Within 15 mins of it being on in my room, immediately I noticed how light and fresh the air is. There\u2019s no unpleasant scent at all other than the new filter smell which doesn\u2019t bother me. After 1 1/2 weeks of using it, this new filter smell is gone and it\u2019s just fresh air. I love it. It gets rid of cooking smells too. I love cooking fresh fish often, and man, this purifier eliminates the odour within an hour compared to 3-4 days of lingering fish smell inside of the house. No more opening windows in the middle of winter just to air out odours. Noise Level is appropriate and can be tolerated. First level of air option is very quiet and almost no noise. Second level option you can hear the fan but sounds like a subtle white noise, Third level of air option, strong fan noise but man it\u2019s very effective! Manoeuverability is easy. I like that the button to turn on the purifier is tap sensitive. The machine could use a nook for the hands on the sides for easier to move from one place to the other. There\u2019s a warning label on top of the machine to carry the machine from the bottom when moving or carrying. The fan on top is connected to the filter at the bottom. There\u2019s a locking mechanism between the two chambers, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a sturdy lock and agrees that it\u2019s safer to carry from the bottom and not from the sides of the machine. Weight is light for younger folks but I don\u2019t recommend grand parents to carry the machine on their own. Overall, amazing air purifier!",

                "reviewText": "This unit arrived today, so I can't speak to the efficacy of it beyond my initial impression that it certainly changes the feel of the air quality in the room it's currently placed in.To those saying it's difficult to remove from the box - I'm 5'3 and not a big person. While it's somewhat cumbersome to remove from the shipping box, it's really not that difficult. Grab the packaging box by the sides and continue lifting until it slides out - takes maybe 30 seconds. Unless you aren't able bodied and then I'd recommend slicing the carboard box sides on each corner with an exacto knife so that the box folds openRemoving the unit from the packaging box? Get your hands halfway down inside the box, grip the sides of the unit (not the top part, it even has a sticker on it asking the user *not* to pull from the top since that's the portion that disconnects from the base) and pull up. Takes a moment but it'll slide right out.In terms of the size (which is available online *before* you purchase) it's 13\" wide x 13\" deep x 20\" tall. I'll be moving it from my bedroom to living room on occasion, it's not cumbersome to move at all because it's light. If you've got the pre-filter on, slide your hands under the pre-filter, grip the lower half of the unit and pick it up. Pretty simple.Sound: Low/eco setting is *very* quiet, medium setting is akin to medium speed on a traditional fan and high is, well, akin to the high setting on a fan. I've got the unit sitting 1.5 feet away from me (my bedroom is not that large) and the medium setting isn't very loud, I could take a call and still hear who I'm speaking to. They might be able to hear it in the background but I mean.. just turn it down temporarily.I'll update in a week or two once it's been running for awhile. I live beside a construction site and near a bunch of trees, my allergies are brutal and I've been without relief for a few weeks now. Hoping for a marked improvement.",
