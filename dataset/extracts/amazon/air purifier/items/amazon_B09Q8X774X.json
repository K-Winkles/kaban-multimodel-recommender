I\u2019m using it in a normal sized bedroom and the air seems pleasant after the first 24 hours of auto use. You'll need to purchase replacement filters as the main filter is not washable. The cord is too short at maybe 4 ft and too thin also the light from the \u201cfan\u201d and \u201con\u201d positions is way too bright even on night setting so I covered the control panel with a metal lid to block the glow. It runs very quietly and seems to be a nice unit. I like it.",

                "reviewText": "Bought 1 Homvana Model H201 to remove green wood smoke from my bedroom...hopefully, ease or prevent our coughing fits. My house is an old, small house. The Homevana Model 201 worked so well in the bedroom, bought another one for the living room. Neighbors have their fireplace going right now, putting green wood smoke (green wood smokes much more than dried wood) in the outside air right now. The whole neighborhood smells like smoke. The wood smoke from the neighbors fireplace is rolling into my house every time somebody opens the door. With one air purifier running in the bedroom and one running in the living room, AMAZINGLY, there is no smoke odor in my house. Normally, when the neighbors burn wood my whole house smells like wood smoke. No wood smoke in my house is so wonderful because I can breathe without coughing, choking, sneezing, runny nose or my eyes watering.With the new Biden nomics it appears to me that people are dealing with problems paying their high cost heat bills; I am expecting more people to burn wood because here, they can cut it for themselves for free. I ordered a third air purifier to have on hand, just in case it is needed for any reason.",
