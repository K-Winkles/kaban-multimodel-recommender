It came to my door next day, very promptly. I bought it due to COVID-19 rapidly spreading US and I want to have a cleaner air in my house. I don\u2019t know if this UVC air purifier with ionizer option kills Coronavirus, but it certainly provides fresh air in my house. I can smell the fresh air.I had a little difficulty to pop open the front cover since the plastic bag wrapped around the filter needed to be removed before using. I couldn\u2019t locate \u201cthe lock\u201d at the bottom of the cover. I sent a message to the customer service and within seconds I was helped. Although the customer service couldn\u2019t help me since I asked for a photo, I am happy with their speedy response. I managed to locate the latches, shown in my photo, which are under the instruction label and the symmetrical locations on the other side. I forced open and completed my mission.I only used for one day and I am happy to purchase this product. In the future I will update my review if I encounter any negative aspects.* update: I have been using this air filter for a week. It works really great! I always have mild allergy symptoms and this air filter made me symptoms free when I was at home. I had never expected this outcome when I purchased this product!* update: I have used this item for a year! I LOVE IT! Bought another one for my parents. They LOVE IT too! When I replaced the filter, I can see how much debris the filter caught: A LOT! Strongly recommend this item.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this Air Purifier last summer when I had recently relocated to a large 1 bedroom apartment in an Urban area. I was concerned about the air quality of the area where I was living, so I searched Amazon for an affordable Air Purifier that could cover over 1000 square feet in area.I found the \u201cAzeus Smart True Air Purifier\u201d and decided to purchase it. The remote control is very convenient and allows you to turn on or off the display lights for when you may be sleeping. It also allows control over the UV enhanced Purification feature. You can set the machine to run on a timer or remain on. It has an air-quality sensor that will change the color of the display lights from Blue to Green to Red, depending on the current quality of the air. Blue being the cleanest with red indicating that the air needs to be purified further. The machine automatically makes adjustments when it senses that the air quality has dropped and along with the display color change, the power of the fan will temporarily increase until the air has been purified to an acceptable Level.My unit somehow began to malfunction after a recent move, I\u2019m unsure as to the cause, perhaps I was damaged during the moving process. Regardless, since my Amazon return time window had expired, I contacted the company Directly. The agent that I chatted with ask me to send a video of the unit showing the issue that I was experiencing. Upon reviewing the video that I shared, he informed me that the company would be sending me a new replacement unit, and that is the unit I am currently using that you will see in my uploaded video\u2026Thanks!",

Yes, it is noisy when it\u2019s on high but that lets me know it\u2019s doing its job. Otherwise, it\u2019s very quiet. The instructions indicate that the filter needs to be vacuumed weekly and the interior of the purifier should be wiped out. I have done this according to instructions, and I have had absolutely no problem with the device having any malfunction. I have noticed a tremendous reduction in dust in my home. Thinking about getting another one to use specifically in a guestroom for when guests with allergies visit because I have two cats.",

                "reviewText": "This is a review of the AZEUS GL-FS32 Air Purifier.I purchased this (7 months ago) to work as my central purifier for my home. It's in my living room and shares air access to our dining room. We have other individual purifiers for our bedrooms. This purifier has some great features such as the auto detect mode that works great. The LED lights let you know the quality of your air simply by looking at the color on top of the purifier with nice looking accent lighting around the top trim of the unit. If the unit is in auto mode and detects poor air quality the light will change to the corresponding color and the unit will adjust the fan speed until the air quality is better.The downside - The purifier is loud when on high. It's not only loud but make a whistling sound that is different from all the other fan speed levels that are really quiet on the lowest settings to fairly quiet just below the high setting...BUT, high is pretty noisy. We normally set it to high at night when we go to bed and keep it in auto mode during the day when we are home.Only other issue we had were getting replacement filters for awhile during the beginning of the Covid outbreak but now you can get them here on Amazon... They are a little costly so I recommend just blowing and cleaning the one you use a few extra times to make it last a little longer.Summary - Really good purifier that I would recommend!",
