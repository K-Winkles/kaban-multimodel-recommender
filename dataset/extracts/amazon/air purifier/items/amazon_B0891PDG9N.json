                "reviewText": "Excellent air purifier. Comes with three modes: auto, sleep, and turbo. The auto and sleep mods are extremely quiet; you can\u2019t even tell that it\u2019s on. The turbo mode is much louder but really made a difference in the air quality quickly. Has a light function that can be turned off if you find it bothersome. Also comes with a timer function that can be set to 2, 4, and 8 hours. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with this air purifier.",

Why purchase an air purifier that increases the amount of ozone you breathe!I've had this unit for about a month. So far, so good. Noise level is acceptable, and you're not paying for a lot of bells and whistles that you don't need.",
