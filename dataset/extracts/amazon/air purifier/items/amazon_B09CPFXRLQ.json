                "reviewText": "I was very hesitant to buy a purifier anywhere seeing everyone\u2019s experiences. I went on a limb and bought this one and I do not regret it! It was delivered much sooner than it was suppose to and it was very well packaged, and easy to put together. The app is just a plus all together! I have also noticed a big difference in the air quality and I\u2019m super happy with it. It\u2019s not too loud when it\u2019s on the highest level, but definitely noticeable, almost like a fan. The other fan settings (regarding sleep mode) are nice as well. It\u2019s perfect for someone who just likes a little background noise, not distracting but also not dead quite. The sleep mode is excellent! I always forget I even have it on!",
