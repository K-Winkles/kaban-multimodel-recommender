                "reviewText": "I had to return this. It did not say it in the product description before I bought it that it could damage the painted wall. The packaging stated to put some kind of clear glue or sticker on the wall where the item is plugged into because there could be damage to the paint. This is very perplexing to me to find out after the fact that this could happen. I am glad that I read the package warning first. I would suggest this item come with what they are suggesting to put on the wall to protect it from damage. Unfortunately the nice size and the price did not have me keeping it because of the other problem.",
