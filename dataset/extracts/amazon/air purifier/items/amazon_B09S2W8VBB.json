            "Efficient H13 Purification: Equipped with an H13 True HEPA Filter and a high-efficiency filtration system, our air cleaner can effectively filter particles as small as 0.3 microns in the air. When you turn on the high-efficiency air purifier, it can refresh the air in a room as large as 1095 sq ft / 100 m\u00b2 every hour, providing you with a new and comfortable air environment throughout the day in your home or office.",
            "Dual Air Treatment: Our air purifier not only uses H13 True HEPA filter to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, but also features a light treatment technology to further purify the air. With this dual treatment system, we provide more comprehensive air purification, ensuring a healthier living environment for you and your family. (Note: The function is turned off by default, please turn it on to maximize the air purifier's performance.)",
            "Feel The Air Change: Our air purifier comes equipped with a built-in PM2.5 sensor, so you don't have to play the guessing game with your nose. When the air quality drops, our purifier will go into action and the indicator will turn yellow or red, and the fan will speed up to clean the air faster. Trust us, your lungs will thank you for the break from the dirty air.",
            "Your Silent Companion: Ssshh...can you hear that? No, it's not the sound of silence, it's the sound of our air purifier in sleep mode! With low noise and low speed, it's the perfect companion for a good night's sleep. It will not disturb your sweet sleep, and even a light sleep baby can enjoy the comfortable air on a quiet night.",
            "Filter Replacement Made Easy: Say goodbye to the hassle of replacing air filters. Our air purifier makes it a breeze! Simply open the filter cover, grab the rope on the side, and voila! You can easily take out or replace the filter inside. We recommend replacing the air filter every 3-6 months to ensure optimal air purification. (Pro tip: For best results, always use the official filter!)"

                "reviewText": "This is the best air purifier I have ever owned. This thing is efficient and effective and it ACTUALLY does what it says it does. The real deal. The airflow output is smooth and quiet yet is powerful enough to circulate more than an entire room. I have never smelled or breathed in such clean air. The filters that go in this purifier are HEAVY DUTY and THICK. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re actually removing smells and toxins from the air. I bought a pair of the Blue (Antibacterial) MK04 filters off the manufactures page and I swear by those things.Functionality and ease of use is simple. The ring light letting you know the status of your air in the home is an awesome concept and works well. Design is sleek as well. Overall this thing is the REAL deal and will get the job done. Don\u2019t hesitate just buy it.",

                "reviewText": "My house is a total of 3000 sqft with an almost all open floor plan. Lots of dust, pollen and pet dander in my home and we were constantly cleaning the filter on our air conditioner. Plus there were days my allergies were unbearable. I purchased another brand for the bedroom which was twice as expensive and it works OK so I wanted another for the main area of the house. Did some research on this model and purchased it for the living room/den/dining area because it claimed to clean more than 1000 sqft, which is about the size of the three rooms combined. We have two big dogs and the Mrs smokes. As soon as I turned the unit on it lit up red ( poor air quality) which I already knew. Within 45 minutes it changed to yellow and 1/2 hr later it was lighting blue. Noticed a big difference within a few hours of receiving this and turning it on. This unit works much better than the other one I have in the bedroom, at half the cost. Very quiet operation, and seems to do an excellent job. The dust was cut down considerably, the cigarette smoke smell is almost gone, the air feels lighter and more crisp already. Will purchase another for the other area of my house ( kitchen, other dining area, etc... Very happy with unit and the price was right.EDIT: After using continuously for an entire month I have to say this unit is fantastic! The amount of dust in my home is greatly reduced. My allergies are much better, and the air is crisp and clean. I could not be happier with this and it is by far one of the better purchases I have made. Buying another for a different area of my home.",

I check the filter every week and it collects a lot of airborne dirt and dander. I like the built in air quality detection and display. I purchased some replacement filters as they are not very expensive but I think they will last as this thing is very good at what it does. I will take some pictures as I continue to use this and post them. Overall, I am very happy with this and plan on getting another.",

The color ring will change based on air quality, giving you an indicator of how good the air you're breathing is. This can be easily turned off at night, so only a small blue dot is lit. Sleep mode makes it whisper quiet if you're the kind of person that needs no noise to sleep.Comes with one filter too, with recommendation to change every 3 to 6 months depending on how much \"filtering\" it has to do.After running for only a few hours I could already tell the air seemed \"crisper\" with the filtering.Got it for a Black Friday deal, but I feel it would of been worth the full price.",
