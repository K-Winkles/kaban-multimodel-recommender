We've tried to convinc e ourselves its similar to the \"placebo effect\", but we have to be honest with ourselves and admit that these are really doing some good for the air in our living room. One day i put them in the kitchen when i deicded to do some deep-frying for dinner. Usually i can't stand the smell of the oil from frying, as it lingers in the house for a day or so. These little things really helped to wipe out the smell by the time i went to bed.The reason for the four stars is because one of them started making a slight rattling sound at lower speeds. Not terrible, but when the house is quiet and i'm sitting and reading, it does become noticeable. I've tried to see what it could be, but haven'e been able to find anything loose.The other one, though, is doing just fine and is quiet.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this set for our living room and bedroom. During the winter, things start to feel a little stale in our house since we're not opening the windows frequently and I was hopeful that these would help circulate and clean the air to keep things fresh. These are fantastic!-They're small and easy to move. They plug into a traditional outlet but are light and could easily be transferred from room to room based on your needs.-They come with extra aromatherapy pods that can be changed out frequently. We're not currently using this feature but I love that they came with back-up pods so that you have a good stash to begin with.-They circulate air REALLY well! Considering how small these are, they work great! Our living room is about 20x24 and our bedroom is about 16x18, so both are big spaces. These got the air moving almost immediately in both rooms.-They're quiet! I would expect that with as much air as these are moving, they would be noisy but they're not at all. In fact, they're essentially silent. We've kept them set at the 2nd settin (Level 2) and haven't noticed any change in noise in our house.-They're easy to adjust and have 3 settings.-They are well packaged. Instructions are included and easy to follow and they come with 2 of everything.My only concern is finding a filter that works with these since they're a more independent brand but the company reached out after I purchased and before they arrived to let me know that I can order them from them, so I'm resting assured that I'll be able to keep these purifiers going for a long time to come.",

I think it's hard to really gauge how well something is purifying the air, but we have 3 cats and have seasonal allergies, so hopefully it's doing its job.It is realtively quiet and doesn't bother us when we're sleeping, but we also don't mind a little fan noise at night. Overall I'm happy with them so far. They are simple to use and can be easily moved and placed where you need it. Should any issues arise down the road I'll come back and update this review.",

Came in a box and it was all wet from the rain, but inside was the original box for the purifiers so it kept everything dry and clean. Was packaged really well.Next we opened it up to see the aromatherapy pads to put essential oils, if you wish to in which I won't be. Then you have the adapter and the booklet.It is very easy to install. You don't even need the booklet for instructions. I looked up the filters for these and they are not inexpensive. However as with all hepa filters, it is the right range.These purifiers have front and back. I really love that. You're really gathering more dust and dander in the air and bringing out fresher air.I really think this is a good deal. These things are not big so it's space saving. Right now they are not in stock. Hope they come back in stock soon so others can order this.",

                "reviewText": "These were exactly what I was looking for. I have had more expensive air purifiers in the past but had to return them because they sounded like a jet engine when they were on or were not efficient.You get 2 for the price of 1 of the more expensive ones, which is a great deal to start. There are 4 settings (1, 2, 3, H and E(?)). E and 1 are quiet, even quieter than a regular fan where it can't be heard.I have had them running in their respective rooms (living room + bedroom) since I got them and already noticed a significant decrease in dust, and to boot, the added aroma filters at the top (when added to the discs) are better than regular diffusers. The scent is evenly distributed and consistent but not overwhelming.One of the biggest perks is the outlet, its cord faces downwards on the plug so it can be pretty much flesh with furniture if you are putting it there and doesn't protrude like other outlets do.To boot, they are compact, not super tall or thick where it is a hindrance. They are really small and can be easily placed pretty much anywhere without an issue.Overall, highly recommended if looking for an air purifier.",

The different fan levels are great, and the bonus white noise is appreciated. It can be a little loud on the higher setting, but I've got it on the second lowest setting in my office and it's not disruptive.My only concern at this point is the availability of replacement HEPA filters - I see they're available on the .com site, but not currently in stock on .ca, although I will keep an eye.",

There are two big thick filters on each side, and the air that the fan sucks through them is huge even on the lowest, quietest setting.On the lowest setting you can barely hear anything, and I think that's probably enough to do what you need in a regular room. The highest setting sucks and blows some serious air and of course is louder, but still isn't bad at all.They look great, which is a huge bonus.

                "reviewText": "We needed an air purifier for two bedrooms so this was ideal. This is a basic air purifier with simple functionalities (speed & timer) with a level display. I found it impressive that this air purifier also has a Carbon filter to remove smoke particles in addition to the H13 HEPA filter. Most Air purifiers with carbon filters cost way more. Level 1 and Sleep mode noise level is quiet, but levels 2 and 3 are significantly loud. You can also use it as an aroma diffuser by adding a few drops of aroma scents to the provided pads. Overall, the build quality is pretty good, it\u2019s fairly compact and light. Do note that each purifier covers 345 sq. ft. The 695 sqft in the description is a combined area when both devices are used in the same space.",
