                "reviewText": "I've had this unit since 2020. We have a forced hot air heating system in our home and I tend to get stuffy in the winter with the windows closed. This unit helps quite a bit to eleviate that problem. I have it in a 12 x 12 room and it seems to do a good job in that space. It's especially effective near the computer where I spend a good amount of time. It does a good job of clearing up cooking odors and it's very quiet, too.",

                "reviewText": "Update: i never update reviews but today I am. It is working great! I opened it up just to see if its doing its job and honestly I was surprised by all the dust tht it had collected. Sorry I didnt take photos. So I decided to take it home instead of my office and put a different one there. Using in my bedroom to see if it helps with the dry throat and burning eyes I wake up with. I have 3 small dogs and an ongoing mold/fungus growth issue in our bathroom in our main room.Just wanted to say I also tested the unit to see if the light would change colors indicating dirty air or not. I vape (yeah i know i need to stop) and Ive always known tht the vapors it creates is not just vapor mist, its a carcinogen, better than cigs but anyways\u2026\u2026I blew my hit straight into the unit and it responded immediately. Took it a few seconds before going back to blue. So yes it works, and yes it cuts down on dustmites, skin cells, and dog hair. Also cleans the air from stinky baby diapers tht have had a blow out, so smells too.I love this unit. Its pleasing to look at and it works. Wish it was available in different colors like maybe black, navy or my fav color Terra Cotta. Either way anyone tht sees it asks me info about it so Im sure Ive referred a few buyers this way. If I had the $ i would get one for every room in my house! Honestly I think it wrks better than my Levoit I have thts the same size.Not sure yet how clean its getting the air in my space but it does wonders for smells and gives off a nice white noise. Im using it in my office. Im a massage therapist so anything to reduce noise from next door and help with skin cells going everywhere is welcomed! Plus its nice looking which is a bonus!",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed after unboxing this purifier is the look and feel of the device -- it feels VERY sturdy, and aesthetically looks like something Apple or Dyson would produce. I opened the device up to remove the plastic from the filter, and the inside appearance matched the quality of the outer shell. Overall, I was well impressed with the appearance.After plugging the device in, it appears that the same amount of detail was given to the electronic controls of the purifier. The touch controls have a nice \"beep,\" and the noise level from the fan is just enough to hear, but not too loud to be intrusive. I've read reviews of people using this as a noise machine, and I believe it would work well for that. I've used it for three days now, and haven't noticed any difference other than a \"clean\" smell throughout the house. We weren't having any odor issues before, but the house definitely feels and smells fresh and clean. I'll update this review later with more specifics.Lastly, the quality of the filter unit is top-notch. I'm not an expert on HEPA filters, but this filter looks and feels very sturdy and of higher quality.Overall, I believe this purifier is well worth the price, just judging from the apparent build quality, the aesthetics that rival Dyson or Apple, and the quality of the filter unit inside of the purifier. I'd recommend this product to anyone who needs to freshen up an area in their home, or to produce \"clean smelling\" air in a space. Just from my short time with it, and feeling the output from the fan on top, I can only imagine that it does very well with filtering dust and allergens as well.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to get an air purifier due to my neighbor is smoking weed and I live in an apartment and we have all sorts of smells out here. This air purifier is just the right size for my bedroom. The air purifier is solid and I had it for almost a year I kept the filter clean whenever dust builds up so I haven't replaced the filter at all. This has an air quality sensor and has auto features that automatically adjust the fan speed depending on the air quality however the sensor is not sensitive enough to pick up bad air quality even if I farted in front of the filter it doesn't pick up a bad air :) and that's the only complaint I have but overall it is a good air purifier and it serves its purpose. I can feel the difference with and without using it. I can breathe and sleep better at night and using the auto mode it is quiet.",

This is a perfect size for a bedroom and it\u2019s not too big. It\u2019s cute and quiet, as well as easy to use. So far the smell is almost entirely gone from the room and it\u2019s been used one full night. Very happy with this air purifier",

                "reviewText": "I've had two of these for three years now. One still works perfectly like it did when I first got it - changes air quality light colors and fan speeds quickly when I cook to clear the air. I keep that one on auto and keep it in my living room, where my air quality actually changes the most, so it can work its magic.The second one has a broken air quality sensor - it broke about a year ago. If I turn on the air quality light, it's red all of the time. If I put it on auto, it runs full speed constantly. It still works just fine otherwise. I replace the filters on both of them regularly and even the \"broken\" one has a dirty filter when I go to change it, so it still does its job. I think of the one with the broken sensor as my Chicken Little air purifier - it very much thinks the sky is falling so I just set it to 1 all the time and keep it in my bedroom where it doesn't really need to work very hard.Would 100% recommend these and if either of them ever completely kicks the bucket, I will absolutely buy another of this exact model.",
