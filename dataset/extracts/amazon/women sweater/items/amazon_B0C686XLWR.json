                "reviewText": "This Grace Karin sweater checks all the boxes for me! I\u2019m a curvy girl. Sweaters in particular can make my figure look a little balloon-ish. Never my favorite look so\u2026this one\u2019s a hit!It has a collar, so you can easily dress the sweater up or down. it has a slimming, vertical line design woven in the fabric.I like to layer, and this sweater would be good for layering. The fabric is thin. In fact, it has a little bit of sheerness to it. I\u2019m OK with a little sheerness because I won\u2019t get overheated wearing the sweater. I also think it makes it lay on my figure in a more flattering way.Everything is very well done. The knitting of the fabric, the stitching & seams. Even the sizing. Grace Karin has become my go to brand! When I order something from this brand, I\u2019m not disappointed!I absolutely love it! I have it in two colors now. I would highly recommend it. I hope it looks just as great on you!",
