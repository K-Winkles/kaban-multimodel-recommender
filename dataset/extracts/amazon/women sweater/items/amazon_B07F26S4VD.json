You will not have hot flashes wearing this sweater.How often do you find yourself practically fainting from a hot flash in sweaters, but freezing to death if you aren't wearing one? This is the sweater for you. Cotton content means cool and breathable! But it's also soft and lightweight. Buy a size up or more if you want something really roomy because I think these shrink ever so slightly when washed. For the record I wash this and almost everything else in Persil with hot water and dry it in the dryer. It maintains its shape wonderfully.Good quality knit, lightweight, cotton content, soft, it's everything I need. The price is right. Also, I'm not noticing any significant pilling, if any at all.",
