It\u2019s still absolutely beautiful and a tank top fixed this issue but that was the only thing that was needed to adjust on my part! Very comfy and soft. Neckline doesn\u2019t lay tight at the neck it\u2019s nice and loose. I can\u2019t wear turtleneck style shirts but this one is fine it has room around the neck! Also, wore it a funeral in 6 degree winter weather and it was warm enough! Now i recommended a coat over it but it was definitely warmer than expected with the type of sweeter it is. Side note: I am going through perimenopause so i can get warm really quick! In short, it beautiful, soft, comfy and worth the buy!",

                "reviewText": "The first sweater I received had no tags, had been worn and smelled strongly of perfume. It also had HUGE snags on the front of the sweater. I submitted a request for a replacement without even trying it on. The second one arrived with tags and was a new item.It is a very cute sweater and I like the style. I was not expecting the entire front to be able to flip open so you will want to wear a tank or cami underneath or add a few stiches along the bottom to keep it from flying open. The material is soft and the knit is loose so it's not very warm. The loops in the knit are also so loose that they snag easily but are also easy to \"work\" back in by gently tugging the area around the snag in every direction. Overall, I really like the sweater. I am not sure how long it will hold up. For the price, I can't say that I would purchase this knowing what I know about it now. I bought this late in the winter season and do not expect that it will hold up to be able to wear next winter.",
