I did the try it before you buy it and thought I\u2019d send it back if it\u2019s shrink. I washed it in cold and then put it in the dryer, and it did not shrink. I was kind of hoping it would just a little bit because I bought the large knowing I have a shirt underneath it probably. I actually like it being a little bigger. I\u2019m 5 foot four 140 pounds. This is appropriately loose enough for me. Don\u2019t think I\u2019d like a skin tight sweater you won\u2019t be disappointed. The quality is there.",

I was worried it might be too delicate but after I washed it on gentle it was fine. One dries this flat. It might be best to wash with other gentle items bc I washed it alone and had to press out the water before laying it to dry.I think the price I paid for this makes it a good value.",
