                "reviewText": "Don't understand the negative reviews. These are beautiful, warm & soft. They are a knit and have some stretch. Of course they're printed. If the patterns were woven in, the cost would be much higher. I personally like the fringy seams. They aren't as slouchy as they look on the models but they still fit (not tight) and look great. The sleeves are close fit (not too tight/not too loose) and I like the slightly long length. Check their size chart. If you want really slouchy, go up a size...or two (I got the largest size already... so...). I didn't get the fabric lab tested but would bet money they are cotton and wool as described. (I've been around long enough to see the evolution of polyester fabric over the decades.) Similar sweaters are found elsewhere with the same design that do say they are poly, nylon, etc. and they cost less. These say 'updated fabric' and believe they are as stated - cotton/wool. If they aren't natural fabrics, I don't really care because they feel great. I've already washed one on gentle/cold and hung to dry. Still fits... (you can stretch them back out a bit if necessary). Bottom line: warm and soft; plenty designs to choose from.",

I find that a little unsettling. I did wash it from the advise in the reviews. Used delicate and laid it flat to dry. It seems to have washed up pretty good. Doesn't look like it shrank. Now the size, I ordered the XXL based on reviews . I normally wore a 1X because of my chest size so I went with the XXL. It is a pretty good fit except it fits tunic style, I am 5\"1 but didn't expect it to be quite so long. But the sleeves are perfect. After I wear it, I will update but I thought that I would just mention the lack of any tags.",

I layer it with a light weight shirt underneath. I live in the desert, it's cold at night but gets warm in the middle of the day so it's perfect to wear with leggings or even a skirt. It's light weight but soft & warm. The colors are vibrant & fun. I have no problem with any itch. I prefer these sweaters to wearing a jacket because they are so beautiful. They are a causal but classy look. I'm in the fashion industry and these sweaters are the bomb! I'm 5'2\", 130lbs & the size Medium was a perfect fit. My 3rd sweater was the black floral print with orange & gold on the bottom and sleeves. I cannot wait to wear these!! Love them!! Colors were all true as pictured. Remember to hand wash & lightly machine dry & then air dry. I wear mine as a covering and just threw it dry into my dryer with a few sprits of water to fluff it up with my dryer balls. Light weight but best over a thin long sleeve tshirt for in the cold desert months.I rarely write reviews but these sweaters are exceptionally unique!! Thanks to the people who designed these! I hope to see more great patterns and colors! \u2764\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9bI just purchased my 5th sweater from this company. They had two on sale, one that I was eyeing and I decided to get it before it's sold out and gone forever. These are very high quality well made sweaters that if properly taken care of should last for years.",

                "reviewText": "Love, love, love this sweater. \"S01 as picture 19\" is the only description I could find of the one I bought. It's the one with the fish and reeds. They all look vastly different. I'm 5,2\", 140 lbs and I bought an extra large because I'm busty and like loose-fitting tops. I could easily have gone down a size and had ample room. This sweater is thin for a sweater, but not so thin it shows every line and every bulge. It is so soft and comfortable to wear that it instantly became my favorite sweater. Also hides a multitude of flaws. A little longer on me than it looks on the model, but in my opinion not long enough to wear with tights. Maybe if I was 20 years younger. I ordered two more with different patterns in large. And may go back for more.",

I will be hand washing this sweater as I was reading the reviews it mentioned that the soft fabric on the inside sheds & it can shed on your other clothes. I purchased it anyway as it\u2019s very unique & cute. It looks great with leggings. The price was reasonable. It comes in a cute bag. My daughter\u2019s came in a bag that had all the air out of it. I suppose it\u2019s easier to ship. Her\u2019s was equally as cute. I jumped out of my comfort zone with this purchase but absolutely love it! I\u2019m short & around 155 lbs. I purchased size medium for both of us. Something fun to wear in your wardrobe!",
