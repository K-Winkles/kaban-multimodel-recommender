I\u2019m 5\u201911\u201d and I was looking for something longer to wear over leggings and these are perfect. Nice, lightweight fabric and very well made. Soft and comfy, easy to wear. They are a bit oversized. I got a large and I should\u2019ve ordered a medium. The sleeves are also nice and long. I have to roll the sleeves up and they\u2019re still loose and comfy! I HIGHLY recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 5\u20193 & approx 178 lbs., ordered XL in the green for a slightly oversized tunic to wear w/ skinny pants for work & leggings for everyday use, and that\u2019s what I got! I have a short/average torso so sometimes tunic shirts either hang like a dress, are too boxy & short, neck line is too high or the torso/bottom is too clingy, but this sweater is perfect length, hitting right below my hips and over my rear, w/ a nice drape over my chest, especially down to my mom pouch. A pinch longer would be nice for shrinkage as I prefer to dry in dryer, but I washed & dried both and they honestly didn\u2019t shrink much, if at all. Material is soft, not itchy or fuzzy (which is soooo important because I chronically itch). It is a \u201cthinner\u201d sweater knit, but not a cheap thin, you can\u2019t see through it or rip easily and doesn\u2019t seem to catch/pull easily on jewelry or surfaces, which I HATE. It is slightly pilling under the armpits, but not more than expected w/ sweaters, nothing a lint shaver won\u2019t fix since the actual knit doesn\u2019t seem to pull easily. Only worn twice so far so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it holds up as I\u2019ve had bad luck w/ new clothes not lasting due to fading or pilling. I\u2019ve looked at these sweaters multiple times in my search for a good average priced tunic shirt, but wouldn\u2019t buy at the regular price point. Sale price was very worth it. Def want more.EDIT: The Black has faded and worn out quicker than I'd like. The round neck black version is not as nice looking, feels sloppy looking now. The tan looks great still and green has pilled more than I'd like, but I've been able to use lint shave on it. Overall still like, but would only repurchase if on a GOOD sale. Wash on cold, put in dryer for 5 mins to get wrinkles out and hang dry the rest for best results!",
