                "reviewText": "I really like 100% cotton clothing, and it is getting more and more difficult to find. Acrylic sweaters tend to look like crap after one season, while cotton sweaters can last for years if laundered gently and air dried. I love the cabled ones for work, as they look slightly dressy but are not hot like wool.I've bought this sweater in blue heather and deep green, and they are great. Vibrant colors, well sewn, nice fit and very soft and comfortable. I'm usually an L or XL, and bought this in a large. It is roomy enough for me, but I wear it with just a camisole underneath. If you plan to wear something heavier underneath, you might want to size up. I'm 5'8\" and long waisted, and this sweater is plenty long --hits me at about mid-hip.Washes up perfectly, with no extra care. I plan on buying at least 2 more, as these are so perfect for work. I've also bought a cabled turtleneck from the Amazon Basics line, and it is great as well. For $25-$30, these are a real bargain. Recommended.",

It\u2019s flatteringly fitted like on the model in the video but not at all tight. It\u2019s a little longer than I would have liked, but I\u2019m short and short-waisted, so that\u2019s common for me. No strong odor like some Amazon clothing I\u2019ve tried before. I\u2019ll probably get another color depending on how it holds up with more washes, but I don't foresee any issues so far.",

Since it's cotton, it breaths as well which is important to me. Unfortunately I cannot wear the sweater. It fits me like a potato sack. I checked the sizing and compared the measurements to 2 of my usual clothing stores. I bought the size with the measurements as close to what I usually buy. Upon measuring the sweater, the bust and waist are 6 inches larger than what is listed in their sizing chart. I'm going to return it and re-order, but at this point I don't know if I need to go 1 or 2 sizes smaller.",
