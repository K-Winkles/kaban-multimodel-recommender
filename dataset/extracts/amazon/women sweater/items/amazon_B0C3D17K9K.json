                "reviewText": "I recently treated myself to the ANRABESS Women's Open Front Knit Cardigan, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This cardigan is the epitome of cozy elegance and has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe.First off, the fabric is incredibly soft and luxurious. The knit material feels gentle against my skin, providing warmth without any itchiness. It's the kind of cardigan you want to wrap yourself in on a chilly day, whether you're heading out or just lounging at home.The open front design adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit. I love how effortlessly it drapes over my shoulders, creating a relaxed yet polished look. The lapel collar gives it that classy vibe, making it versatile enough to dress up for a casual office day or down for a cozy night in.The length of the cardigan is perfect \u2013 it hits just below the hips, providing a flattering silhouette. I appreciate how it adds a layer of warmth without overwhelming my frame. The long sleeves are a great touch, especially when I want that extra bit of coziness during cooler seasons.What sets this cardigan apart is its versatility. The solid color makes it easy to pair with various outfits, and the casual yet chic style means it transitions seamlessly from day to night. I've thrown it over dresses, paired it with jeans, and even worn it with leggings \u2013 each time, it effortlessly elevates the overall look.Durability is another standout feature. After multiple wears and washes, the cardigan still looks as good as new. The knit has held up well, and there's been no noticeable shrinkage or loss of shape.As for sizing, I found it to be true to size. The fit is just right \u2013 not too snug, not too loose. I appreciate that the cardigan has enough room to layer over other pieces comfortably.In conclusion, the ANRABESS Women's Open Front Knit Cardigan is a must-have for anyone looking to add a touch of warmth and style to their wardrobe. It's the kind of piece that effortlessly combines comfort and fashion, making it a go-to choice for various occasions. Treat yourself to this cozy delight; you won't be disappointed!",

I have a printed long sleeve tee that I wanted to have something warm to wear over it, living in Minnesota, at times an extra layer is necessary! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this! The fit was perfect, I am 5'6\"s and 140 lbs, I got the medium. The fit is not form- fitting per say, it has a nice straight down look that I feel many different body types can wear getting the correct size for you. The flaps at the top lay flat and stay, the length is perfect for flats or higher heeled shoes. The color choices are awesome. It is a quality material, not thin, yet not overly thick. very pleased with my purchase!",

Medium in \u201capricort\u201d (tan/beige) had shorter sleeves and overall length! Works better over a shirt so kept the medium and will push up or roll the sleeves.",
