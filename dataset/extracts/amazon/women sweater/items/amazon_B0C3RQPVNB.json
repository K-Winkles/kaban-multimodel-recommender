                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like these and be able to buy more, but they are way too long if you have short legs. Or honestly I think they would be long on any legs! I pulled them out of the package and laughed because I had to hold them over my head to allow them to open fully. To be fair, I'm 5' tall, but I haven't had this issue with other tights (not this extreme anyway). I washed them and they did shrink a bit, but still super long which makes them very bunched up and uncomfortable around the waist. I do love the soft fabric and the sweater-feel, but just can't wear these which makes me very sad.",
