I wish I had a tan right now, because it would look incredible with darker skin. Would be stunning on you if you have dark skin.The fit\u2026I would say, about perfect, for me. We\u2019re all built our own way, of course, but I\u2019d say I\u2019m average. 5\u20197\u201d, 160 lbs. I ordered the XL and the fit is on the generous side. Not snug, comfortable. Length is just to the lower half of my glutes. Sleeve length hits just at the top of my thumb. So, perfect for me.The fabric\u2026 is extremely plush feeling and soft. Feels like cashmere. It\u2019s on the thicker side, but not too bulky. There is no scratching, even at seams. Feels like it will breath nicely, so I don\u2019t think \u201cpower surges\u201d will be an issue.Care\u2026I haven\u2019t cleaned it yet, but just follow care instructions on label. I have no experience yet with result of that.I will buy more colors of this sweater, as I feel I could even size down to a large and wear beneath a blazer. That charcoal and the ivory are classics.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Amazon Essentials Women's Soft Touch Funnel Neck Cable Sweater, and it has become a staple in my winter wardrobe. This sweater is a delightful find, especially for those chilly days when warmth and comfort are paramount.The first thing I noticed about this sweater was its softness. The fabric is gentle against the skin, making it a pleasure to wear throughout the day. The cable knit design adds a classic touch, making the sweater versatile enough to pair with both casual and more formal outfits.As for warmth, this sweater excels. It keeps me comfortably warm in cold temperatures, striking the right balance without being overly bulky. This makes it an excellent choice for layering, fitting nicely under coats and jackets while still allowing room for a shirt underneath.However, it's important to note that the fit is a bit larger than expected. I recommend considering a size down if you prefer a snugger fit. Despite this, the slightly looser fit does contribute to the overall comfort and ease of wearing this piece.The funnel neck design is another highlight, offering extra warmth and a stylish flair. It\u2019s not too tight around the neck, ensuring comfort even for those who might usually shy away from high-neck designs.In summary, the Amazon Essentials Funnel Neck Cable Sweater is a great addition to any winter wardrobe. It's a wonderful blend of warmth, comfort, and style. Just keep in mind the sizing if you prefer a closer fit. Otherwise, this sweater is a fantastic choice for staying cozy and fashionable during the colder months.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical about this sweater, but went by reviews and bought it in size XL color Ivory. I received it about an hour ago, Kind of weird that it came in a perfectly clear bag. It was neatly folded in the bag, so, no wrinkles. It's heavier than I thought it was, but hoped it would be. The beautiful design isn't only on the front of the sweater as some are, it's on the back and arms also. The cuffs are longer than most and can be worn straight or folded. The sweater can also be worn straight down, as the model is wearing it covering the hips. I pulled it up to where it was more waist-length. Both ways looked great. Not only is the material heavier than most sweaters, it's extremely soft. The design is beautiful and makes the sweater look like one that you would buy for much more money in a high-end women's clothing store. It's absolutely beautiful. I am temped to order in a color. You cannot find a sweater of this quality and caliber anywhere for this price. Buy it, and don't worry, you'll love it.",

Perfectly cozy for casual wear but dressy enough with the texture for work or other needs. I wanted it to work so badly, but being on the bustier side it made me look square.
