I will turn inside out and wash on delicate by itself and air dry flat. I want this to last forever. It was super flattering and I got several compliments! Black is always my goto so it\u2019s fun finding different styles. It is thick (I overheat a lot normally) but this wasn\u2019t terrible and I was actually comfortable all night. I most times wear a tank underneath sweaters for comfort.Last but not least, I will say that I have long hair and it kept getting caught in the pearls. So wear a cute pony if you don\u2019t want that to happen to you.",

                "reviewText": "This is a well-made sweater. It's very soft and it's heavy enough to keep me warm this Fall and Winter without being overly heavy during our milder Southeast Texas winters.It's attractive and very comfortable. It held up well in the wash and didn't shrink.Customer service was super fast when I had an initial issue. When I received the first sweater, the zipper pull was missing. It had broken off at some point before packaging. When I notified the seller, they immediately sent out a replacement that arrived quickly, with no hassles.Yes, I am an Amazon Vine reviewer and receive items for review. But I hate buying something that turns out to be junk after reading glowing reviews. And I know you do, too. So, I do not give dishonest reviews. Amazon only asks Vine reviewers to give HONEST reviews. There is no suggestion or pressure to do otherwise. I have no problem reporting problems or flaws and review accordingly. When I give 5 stars, it is because the product is as described and is good quality, in my experience. I also won't give low reviews because I didn't read the listing. If I missed something in the listing and the item is not as I \"thought\" it would be, I reread the description to see if it was my mistake. If it was due to my mistake, I will not give a low star rating.All that said, I do recommend this sweater. I am just waiting for this horribly hot summer to end so I can finally get to wear it.",

I want a dressy sweater top for Christmas gatherings. This is so heavy it\u2019s actually bulky. It doesn\u2019t hang nicely on the body but keeps its own shape, like a heavy wool ski sweater. The neckline doesn\u2019t lay flat as pictured but is a mock turtleneck which comes up on the neck. Not a flattering style in my size. I would have returned it but didn\u2019t try it on in a timely manner and it was too late to return it. A waste of money. If you need a heavy bulky sweater to wear outside, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want one with pearls sewn on the sleeves. If you want a soft stylish dressy indoor sweater for a party, this isn\u2019t it.",
