                "reviewText": "I, like many other people leaving reviews, was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this turtleneck! It surprisingly soft and well made given the price point and looks like it cost FAR more than it actually does. I've worn it once thus far and gotten quite a few compliments!It isn't sheer at all and IMO runs true to size. It's a great staple piece to have in a closet and goes well with jeans or slacks. Overall, I have no complaints, very pleasantly surprised. I usually don't trust clothing from amazon but after this, I think I'll be giving some more clothing from this brand a try :) wish it came in more colors honestly.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5 foot 8 inches and this long sleeve fits me perfectly. As a tall girl it is hard to find tshirts that will fit the length and the width of my arms. This turtle neck does just that, it has a good amount of stretch and is super soft and keeps me warm during the mountain winters. However, I will say the turtle neck aspect fits a little looser than I would like it to, but it is still cute and serves its purpose of keeping my neck warm.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not much for a turtleneck person, I don\u2019t really like them. I was also skeptical because this fabric looked thin and didn\u2019t seem like it would fit nicely. But I actually REALLY like this sweater! The reviews were right, the inside has warm soft material, and it definitely keeps you warm outside! I wore it to a job interview. It compliments the body as well, and it would look cute paired with so many things (the dress I have in one pic was a little too big but I was out of time to exchange it before the interview lmao). Even just with leggings it looks really nice. The outside material is really soft too, and it\u2019s not that trashy type of fabric that collects fuzzies when you dry it. This is a win in my book. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Definitely recommend. Great for price, good, stretchy, soft material. For anyone else who doesn\u2019t care for turtlenecks but looking for one, I recommend this!",

Nice stretch that maintains shape! I wish this shirt was made without a turtle neck because I would buy every color. (My account is under my husbands name! Yes, a women posted this lol)",

I loved the feel of the material, very soft and the texture and fit are perfect. The arms have a nice length and covers the wrist nicely. The length is perfect , it sits below the waist so you can tuck it or keep it out. It\u2019s not see through and the chest fits nicely too. I ordered a medium size and I\u2019m so glad because it\u2019s a roomier size. But it still looks like a form fitting top. I haven\u2019t worn it yet so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a hot top but it feels like it\u2019s a normal temp when it\u2019s on. Really nice material and I would definitely recommend and order more in the future!",
