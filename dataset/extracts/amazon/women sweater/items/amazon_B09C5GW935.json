I got a medium, and it\u2019s still perfectly roomy and covers my rear with plenty of space to spare. (I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d tall.)

Cozy & soft, gorgeous creamy color, keeps me warm but not sweaty, great weave, flattering fit. I am 5\u20198, 225 lbs, have a short torso, and carry most of my weight in my midsection (often get asked if I\u2019m pregnant) - I probably would not wear this without pants/leggings, but I never intended to, so for my style, I love the length. I machine wash on delicate & hang to dry - so far just a touch of pilling on underside of sleeves & side seams since I ordered in November, but nothing terrible. I absolutely will be ordering this in more colors. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m usually a L/XL. 5\u20192, 190 lbs. DDD bra for reference. The XL was to big. The sleeves were very long even for an oversized look. Length was good, came right above my knee. Was very baggy though. I do love an oversized look, this was burlap bag oversized. Good quality, thick material. I already removed the tag so I\u2019ll keep and figure it out but def size down.",

Soft colour, soft knit, made to look bulky but doesn\u2019t feel it when on. Came about 2inches above the knee. Could see my bra and undies they knit.. may be ok with a tank and those \u201cshear look\u201d leggings underneath.. wouldn\u2019t go to a small for me as I think it would loose the oversized look",

Ohne Hose bzw. nur mit einer Leggins/Strumpfhose ist das nicht tragbar.Der Pulli riecht auch sehr muffig, was beim Waschen sicher weg gehen w\u00fcrde. Da er aber zur\u00fcck geht, werde ich das nicht heraus finden ;-)",
