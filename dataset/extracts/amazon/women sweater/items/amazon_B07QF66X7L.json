I love wearing them with my suede & wool riding jackets & blazers and tall riding boots or dress boots.I have been gradually adding more colors to my closet...I almost have them all!! They are equal in quality to the more expensive brand on Amazon. The savings allows me to have more of them \ud83d\ude0a These sweaters are a must have in every wardrobe.I like them to be loose and long. The L & XL are long enough to wear with leggings without a jacket, but are not baggy looking because they drape nicely",

The body itself is a lightweight knit. It's a true layering piece for me. My only complaint is the size. I bought the large which should be just a little loose for me which I wanted. But it was quite tight, it makes it feel clingy in all the wrong places. If it had been a true large, I would have given fives across the board. I am going to return it and re-order in an XL. The color assortment is lovely. Nice job, please bring yellow, pale lilac and other colors that look good under black suits. Thanks!",

I am tall (6 feet) and it is wonderful to have a sweater where the sleeves long enough to my wrists, and the length of the sweater is also long, falling at my hips. If you are tall, this sweater is for you! I also like that the sweater is thin because I plan on wearing it underneath a sweatshirt. The sweater also looks great by itself. I plan on buying more colors of this same sweater.",
