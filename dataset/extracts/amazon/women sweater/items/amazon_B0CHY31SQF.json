The material was a nice, thick sweater material, did not feel cheap at all. The color was just as pictured. My only complaints are in regards to the length and fit. I am 5\u20194/130ish pounds. I felt it was list slightly too short for my comfort as it hit about mid thigh, and the fabric, per sweater dress fashion, was more fitted around the hem than I hoped. I think if it had been looser around the bottom, the shorter length would have been fine.",
