But this one is so cute, soft, don\u2019t cling to show my rolls but yet don\u2019t look like a sheet. I purchased a size 5x as I am 6ft tall and 381lbs. The length a little below my waistline.I will say this to read cleaning handling instructions as I don\u2019t want to mess up such a beautiful sweaterGreat quality material",
