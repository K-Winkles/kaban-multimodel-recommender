                "reviewText": "I sized up in the sizing chart and it still came plenty big, but that's perfect for me - I always wear an athletic shirt under sweaters to keep my sensitive skin from freaking out, and I've also been suffering from some sensory issues with snug clothes, so I'm very happy with the fit. If you prefer a tighter fit, you could probably size down.The color I got is a very lovely burnt orange, which I find very flattering on pale folks like myself. I included a few photos to show different ways you can wear. Letting it fall, it definitely falls to mid hip or lower. If that isn't a flattering spot on you (it isn't really on me because I'm very wide hipped, so clothing stopping there is accentuating my widest part - and who wants that amirite?), it looks cute tucked in or with a French tuck (half tuck), or you can do a little roll n knot - I tied with a cloth hair band and rolled it into it in the last photo, which I find to be a stylish alternative for T-shirts and anything else boxy that falls to that unflattering spot on me. The neck is a fairly high turtle neck. I might try to stretch it out a little.I'm docking a point because the interesting yarn pattern on the sleeves, also makes it a bit of a pain and a risk of snagging on things. A few strands are already pulled out a bit and I haven't even worn this out yet. It probably says hand wash only but I'm no hand wash gal so I think as long as it goes in a garment bag it should be ok.I'll update if there's anything else if interest - it's still too hot out for sweater season, but I look forward to rocking this once it hits!",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s meant to look oversized, but I ordered a medium when I normally wear a large, I listened to the other reviews. It fits very,very big. A size medium fits like an extra large so be mindful of that. Made very well. The turtle neck part comes up very high and stiff.",

The turtle neck is very large so if you don\u2019t like that, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it; however, if you do like turtle necks like I do, it\u2019s perfect!
