I bought it to pair with cute but not very warm tops during the winter and I ended up wearing it four days straight to work as a jacket. It was so comfortable. I never took it off. It\u2019s warm. It\u2019s a heavyweight sweater, but it breathes and so you\u2019re comfortable. I really like the way I feel and look in this sweater.",
