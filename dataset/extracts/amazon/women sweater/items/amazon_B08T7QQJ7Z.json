                "reviewText": "This is a great basic sweater. The material is so soft, cozy, and warm but not too heavy for southern winter temps. I'm between a small and medium in tops depending on the brand and cut, and the small fit perfectly - figure flattering and stretchy without being baggy or frumpy. I ordered this in a few colors and might even get some more.I do suggest being careful with washing and drying this sweater. I washed mine on cold normal cycle, fluffed in the dryer and then air dried. The material does fuzz up a bit in the dryer.",

The color is darker than shown on my monitor; more of a leaf green, - not lime green as I'd hoped. However, it's still a lovely color. This is a perfect 3 season sweater for here in NC. Excellent with my stretch pants, skirts, and under my blazers. I'll keep it.",
