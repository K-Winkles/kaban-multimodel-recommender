She says the sleeves are way too long. She wears a large this is a medium, on the description, it said to size down she wears a large I ordered a medium the sleeves are way too long and it snagged.I was very disappointed and so was she lives in Texas I live in Georgia. It\u2019s gonna be difficult to return it. For some reason she received another sweater today the same one same issues I would not recommend this item at all to anyone. I had also bought one for my daughter it\u2019s wrapped under the tree, so don\u2019t know how that one\u2019s gonna fit her.",
