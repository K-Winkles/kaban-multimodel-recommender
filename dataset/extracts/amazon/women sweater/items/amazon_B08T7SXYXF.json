                "reviewText": "I've been looking at all cotton cable knit sweaters at some name brands that cost a lot more than this one, and I honestly don't see a difference in quality. This is a classy, flattering sweater that can be dressed up or down, doesn't pill and retains its color nicely after washing. I knew cotton wouldn't be fluffy like cashmere or poly/acrylic, which tend to pill like crazy, so I'm not sure what other reviewers were expecting from a cotton sweater. It is still soft and comfortable, not at all scratchy, but definitely cottony feeling. I'm short and small on top with average shoulders, and the small was a perfect, flattering fit without being boxy, tight or too long.",

Unfortunately acrylic yarn gives me a rash and I couldn't find any soft warm sweaters this season at Nordstroms which was always my go to store. I decided to take a risk on Amazon because with free returns I had nothing to lose. I am happy I tried this sweater. The color is nice (not as bright as I was worried about). It is soft, warm and the unique cable design creates a flattering fit. I would buy another Amazon essentials sweater without any worries.",

Unless you are extremely thin (I am a size 4) there is not a good way to wear it except straight down. The ribbing around the cuffs and the hem completely stretched out leaving it shapeless. I hadn't even washed it yet. I will probably wash it and donate it to a womans shelter.",

                "reviewText": "I have this in a few colors. I like the cut and pattern. Very versatile. I recently ordered the red. Its not a true red. It\u2019s a darker brown red..kind of like brick. It\u2019s pretty . I am 4\u20199 and 85lb. I\u2019m always an xs or xxs if it\u2019s an option. I deliberately shrink these xs sweaters on hot in the wash to fit my tiny self. They end up good for me. Not loose and almost tight, but it loosens up again as you wear it or stretch it with your hands. If it\u2019s tight you can see through it and the pretty knit pattern distorts\u2026.like on the model in the add. Not a good look. Unless you\u2019re a midget like me I strongly recommend sizing up. The arms run narrow and long. The neck hole is smaller side. If you don\u2019t like anything around your neck you may find it annoying if you get a smaller size. Great price for 100% cotton. Next day shipping was also great.",

Was torn between ordering small or medium but after reading reviews about the fit I decided to risk 'small' and was not disappointed. I'm 5'2\" and 135 pounds. The sleeves are longish (which is great for me as my arms are longish for a sort person and I hate it when sleeves are too short) but the body of the sweater is mid hip - great for a short person. All in all very happy with purchase and am ordering in another colour. Am not worried about shrinkage as I'm one of those lunatics that hand washes, and lays out to dry, all my sweaters (and I have many!)",
