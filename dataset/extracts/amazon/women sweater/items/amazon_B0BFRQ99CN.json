This is a large and it fits perfect because the material is stretchy. I don\u2019t like shirts too big so I like that it\u2019s comfortable (not too tight) but form fitting because of the material, which by the way is very soft!! The sleeves are a good length and the stitching is good, the buttons are sown well and it\u2019s not too low cut. If you wear a large normally you might consider buying the next size up. The only semi bad thing I have to say is, this color was described as red I could tell from the picture that it Was more of a rust color (which I love) so be careful choosing your color.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this sweater in blue, which is really a cool steel looking blue. I got the large since I usually wear tops in size 10/12. It fits well ( disregard my Thanksgiving belly rolls please).The material is very soft, the buttons look fashionable and they are all stitched on well, nothing has fallen off yet. I washed it on cold and dried on very low, it came out perfect and did not shrink or lose its shape. I do recommend this sweater - the quality is great, seams are well sewn, no snags, no threads and it is not your run of the mill style.",

                "reviewText": "I got this top in red and a Size L. The red is actually a muted brick color which I find a soothing fall-neutral, and the Size L fits perfectly true-to-size. The material is a wide-ribbed knit that feels luxurious against the skin, and the Henley-style V-neck gives this top a nice finished look. It's medium-weight enough to fit comfortably beneath a jacket on colder days, or to wear alone atop jeans or leggings when the weather is cool, but not cold. I'm very pleased with this top.",
