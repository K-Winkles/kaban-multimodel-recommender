                "reviewText": "I love the overall look and pattern of this shacket. However, I ordered a medium for myself and a small for my daughter of the exact same color, style, and price. The small did not have side pockets but the medium did have side pockets. The medium also had a care tag and an extra button inside, and the small did not. The quality control on both was rather poor. For example, none of the button holes are properly sewn and will likely fray at some point. The medium also had a small tiny hole under the armpit after one wash on delicate. The medium care tag says it can be washed on gentle and dried in the dryer. With the added thickness of the pockets, I don\u2019t think it would dry very well completely line drying. Despite all its flaws, I decided to keep the medium with the pockets because the colors/ pattern were awesome. I still love the look enough to repair it. If you decide to purchase this item, keep in mind that you may or may not receive side pockets as I\u2019ve read other reviews where the small actually had side pockets (whereas in my case it was the medium with side pockets). Also keep in mind that you may have to do a little bit of sewing on your own or take it to professional to fix button holes, etc.. If you do dry the shacket in the dryer, even on extra low, the arms did shrink approximately one to 2 inches. I normally wear a small, and Amazon recommended a medium. Amazon was right because I wouldn\u2019t have been happy with the small assuming it shrinks like my medium did since I want it baggy.",
