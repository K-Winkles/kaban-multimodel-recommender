I was bamboozled!!My first two sweatshirts were made in Vietnam, this most recent one, the navy & white stripe was made in Pakistan. The stitching, the material, the feel. Everything is subpar. The other two have a real cozy sweatshirt material, gets softer on the inside with every washing. Like a real high quality sweatshirt. The cuffs & neckline fit nicely, the stitching is well done. The striped one, the fabric feels almost plasticky & the inner lining feels like a cheap old Christmas stocking. The stitches are far too apart, they look so haphazardly done. The cuffs & neckline ribbing are scratchy & look like they will stretch out. I\u2019m so disappointed.I wasn\u2019t sure what to rate bc the good ones are great but this bad one is awful. So I\u2019m parking it in the middle. May the odds be ever in your favor.",

I washed it with a dark pair of jeans by accident and they bled and I immediatly ordered a new one because it is one of those staples that you can't do without. The light pink is very nice and has a vintage vibe. I will probably order this in a few other colors I love it so much",
