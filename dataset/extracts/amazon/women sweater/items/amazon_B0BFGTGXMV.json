I usually wear a large in shirts, and bought a large and it has the perfect touch of a little oversized like the pictures. It came with an extra button too. It\u2019s just warm enough. The only thing that I don\u2019t personally have a problem with at all, but some might, is that the seams are on the outside of the shirt which some may think it\u2019s inside out, but that\u2019s just how it\u2019s styled and I don\u2019t think it takes away from how cute it is at all though. Def recommend buying if you\u2019re looking for a new sweater.",

                "reviewText": "This sweater looked so cute in pictures and I\u2019m so disappointed with what I received. The worst thing for me is the colour of the sweater looks nothing like the beautiful cobalt pictured, it\u2019s a duller blue that reminds me of recycling bins. The buttons aren\u2019t the cute round brass-looking ones as shown, they\u2019re just cheap plastic ones that were sewn in with thread that doesn\u2019t match the buttons or the sweater. The seams along the shoulders and arms are sewn on the outside instead of inside and stand out badly, it looks like a mistake instead of a style. The neck is also a bad cut. Instead of the way it\u2019s shown, either buttoned up as a cute slouchy cowl neck or unbuttoned as an oversized collar, it\u2019s not oversized and buttons up a bit too tightly, and when you unbutton it it just falls flat like a bad shirt. The length is ok for me, I can just barely tuck the bottom of the front into regular-waisted jeans, but if you\u2019re taller than me (5\u201d3), it\u2019s probably going to be too short for you. The sleeves are also an awkward length, they\u2019re slightly too short for me and would probably look almost like a 7/8 sleeve on someone taller. There are some threads sticking out of bad seams. The only thing that\u2019s accurate is the over-sized look. I\u2019m about 125lbs and usually wear smalls\u2026 I purchased the small and it is accurately \u201coversized\u201d.Overall this was a waste of the $70+ CAD I paid including shipping. If the store posted accurate photos of what they shipped, I wouldn\u2019t have thrown my money away. 0/5 stars, do not recommend.",
