It was true to size and did NOT pull across my chest or make my hips look big like others I have tried. The sleeve length was perfect and the dress fell to just above my knees. I ordered a size large and I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and weigh about 165. I purchased the dress to wear on my winter cruise, it was so comfortable. Definitely a good buy, I\u2019m going to purchase another color.",

Beautiful, soft knit with a lovely textured pattern. Was warm and cozy, yet not too heavy and not itchy at all. For reference, I'm 5'4 and this was knee length. I generally wear a size 14 and 38G bra and the XL fit beautifully with some room to spare. Got compliments all day with this dress and knee high boots.",
