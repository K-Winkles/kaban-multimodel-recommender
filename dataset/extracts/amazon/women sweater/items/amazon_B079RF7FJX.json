I'm 5'5\" 130 lbs and the med fit me perfectly. I'm short waisted, with more length in my legs, The waist band hits below my hip bone, at the top of my thighs. I blouse it a little up, to add interest under a jacket or cardigan. My only caution would be, that it wouldn't be very flattering if your trying to hide a poochie stomach. It works great for me, but I remember the days, after my pregnancies, when this wouldn't have. I read the comments about it being too thin. I think it's perfect! It is soft, comfortable, lightweight and is a great layering basic! I have the Camel, Brown and Maroon. I just ordered 3 more. The Black, Red and Oatmeal. LOVE THIS SWEATER TOP!",

It is soft and stretchy so it is fitted instead of loose and baggy. It's not very thick so I can ear it under blazers and it is not bulky or hot. It is stretchy enough to wear a camisole underneath it if I want it warmer when I don't wear a blazer. I love the clean front so I can accessorize with jewelry.I HAVE BOUGHT THIS SWEATER IN FIVE OTHER COLORS because they are SO GREAT!!EDIT: Everything above still applies but I've noticed it pills easily so I don't have high hopes the sweater will last very, very long. The photo of pilling under the arms is after just 3 wears.",

The sweater fits well, and is super soft, without being a heavy sweater. I live in Florida, so this is a perfect weight for Central Florida on some of our cool winter days. It's great to wear to restaurants that love to run the air conditioning at 60 something degrees!!!! It is dressy enough to wear in the evenings, and I usually wear a professional long cardigan over top of it. You can dress it up with a nice necklace, or wear it without jewelry for a more casual look. This is very good quality, and I love it!!!",

                "reviewText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50My experience with the Amazon Essentials Women's Classic-Fit Lightweight Long-Sleeve V-Neck Sweater has been average, warranting a three-star rating from me. While the fit is acceptable, I've found the fabric quality to be lacking.One notable aspect is the low-quality fabric used in the sweater. It feels thin and doesn't provide much warmth, which is disappointing, especially for a long-sleeve sweater. Additionally, the overall construction feels less durable compared to other sweaters I've owned.On the positive side, the fit is decent, and the sweater is true to size. However, given the subpar fabric quality, I'm unsure about its longevity and durability with regular wear and washing.Overall, while the Amazon Essentials Women's Classic-Fit Lightweight Long-Sleeve V-Neck Sweater serves its purpose as a basic wardrobe staple, the low-quality fabric detracts from its overall appeal. It may be suitable for occasional wear, but I wouldn't rely on it for long-term use. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",
