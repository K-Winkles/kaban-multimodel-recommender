                "reviewText": "I received the first sweater as a Christmas gift and liked it so well that I ordered a second one for myself. It fits perfectly for me. I'm short at 5'3 and the length is where I want it. For a tall person it might be a little short unless you like sweaters that length. It's not close fitting either. There's plenty of room to wear a shirt underneath. On me it's about 4 inches below the waist. The pattern is nice; but, what I like about it most is the softness & warmth without being bulky. I ordered the orange at a greatly reduced price. I couldn't pass it up. It's a soft orange (not bright) Almost like a light orange. The other one I was given as a gift was the coffee brown and it's like a chocolate brown and very flattering. I would recommend this sweater to my family & friends.",

It\u2019s not stiff (easy to fit your head through the neck) but it\u2019s still thick enough that it\u2019s not too stretchy either. A very happy medium to me. It\u2019s slightly cropped for a boxy look. But not so cropped as to come up to high if you reach above your head. The arm length is perfect to me and the size is accurate.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the orange in a Large, as I am 5'5\" and 164 pounds (size 12). I got a beautiful sweater that was too big. It's exceptionally soft and I like the style and color, but It was huge. I couldn't do an even exchange as I got it on sale and would have paid twice as much to get the next size down... so I shrank it. I washed the sweater and put it in the dryer for 30 minutes. The sweater is a size smaller now and I love it. It didn't pill or lose its shape either. I think this is a great sweater. I just wish I had ordered a Medium the first time.",
