Unfortunately, I don\u2019t believe they still make it. It was ribbed with a large folding collar and balloon sleeves. The only negative about this sweatshirt is it is a bit shorter than I thought it would be. I like longer ones so I can wear them with leggings. Otherwise, great quality and super comfy and fleecy on the inside.",

When I raise my arms forward (parallel to the floor), elbows straight, my wrists are still covered. I normally get a medium but I sized up to a large and I\u2019m glad I did. I have no idea how this holds up after several washes but I\u2019m grateful for the fit and warmth. It\u2019s definitely cozy and the color is exactly as displayed.UPDATE: After a couple washes and wears the fabric holds up and has not pilled or looked raggedy. The sleeves did shrink up about 1.5 inches (arms relaxed at sides) but this is not enough to sour the deal for me. Stretching my arms out in front of me the sleeves still cover my wrists. I will more than likely buy another. Going up a size (medium to large) did the trick for me.",
