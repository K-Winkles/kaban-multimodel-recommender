There is sufficient arm room (for me) to accommodate a fitted \u2014 not tight, not loose \u2014 under layer. Length is very good, open stance v-neck: low enough to show the top underneath and highlight a necklace or scarf as well. Basic, classic, versatile piece. Very good quality and good value. Already washed gently in cool water and tumbled on low 5\u201d \u2014 then hung to dry in a sunny spot for 24 hrs. Held its shape and body as well. Instructions say to dry flat so that may be the better choice at your house. Also purchased in Camel Heather and comments remain the same as above.",

I like the fit and the color. It\u2019s a very thin and lightweight knit, just what I wanted. It adds a layer of warmth without the bulk. And it looks better and more elegant than the red one.

The weight of the fabric is medium so, not too hot to wear inside but not 'wimpy' either. The button holes are sturdy and have not needed resewing. I tend to push my sleeves up at work but they have not stretched out. These are the best clothing purchase that I have made.",
