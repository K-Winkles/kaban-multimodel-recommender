They're good quality, the sizing is correct so they fit like they're suppose to, even after the normal washer/dryer routine, there comfortable, lightweight but warm enough, and they can be worn as either 'casual' or a step above, they just seem to fit any occasion, even an everyday around the house! I rarely receive clothing from online shopping that lives up to the stated 'standards, but these truly do!",

                "reviewText": "This has an Amazon tag that seems to be made in China, but the sizes measure true to US sizes and are pretty close to the sizes of department stores in the US. 2x is relatively true, but I would size up one for a layered shirt look.This sweater is thin and great at 70 degrees. Or warm interiors that you do not want to get too warm near the fire.Good for California in December which is where I live, keep the arms warm but not too hot for Sunny weather. I find it warm enough but nice coverage for my bust at 44F I ordered 2 x. It has a mock turtleneck coverage, which is what I like and it is a nice stretch in case you ordered too small. I think it is fitting true to size.I ordered the green and it is a true forest or viridian green. I like this with the Holiday season it is festive. It feels like soft cashmere and was a surprise for the price. You could wear this to a party or with a nice scarf for an elegant look, or plain for a sporty look. I like that it can be nice for dining out or just watching TV. It runs a little short so those who are long-waisted it will come mid pelvis and short-waisted like me but busty, it will be just below the pelvic bone. I might order another one size larger just in case it shrinks.The fabric is 20% cotton, 20% Modal 55% polyester. Machine wash on the gentle cycle and dry flat.",
