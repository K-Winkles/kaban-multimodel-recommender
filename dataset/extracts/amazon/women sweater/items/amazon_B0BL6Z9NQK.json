It's like the Free People sweater, but at a much better price (I did buy both of mine on sale I must add).I purchased the baby blue and the deep rich teal color - both sooooo beautiful. The quality that I received is fantastic. To maintain ALL my sweaters, I wash them in garment bags and either hang or lay to dry. They're always look like they're brand new.Now, the vaccum wrap upon receiving the sweaters.First one was vacuum wrapped, horribly wrinkled. I steamed the wrinkles out easily enough (a steamer purchased on Amazon).The second one arrived in a regular package, so maybe they read enough reviews to fix this situation. I 100% preferred this regular packaging, so hopefully that's what the company is now doing.Overall, at a sale/reduced price, I think this is a fabulous purchase!Oh, I am 5'7, 130lbs, 34B and I ordered a medium. Love the oversized fit.",

                "reviewText": "I love this sweater! It keeps me warm in drafty rooms and isn't TOO warm (like a merino/cashmere sweater can often be) because of how loose it is. I'm sensitive to fabrics and this is soft and hasn't pilled noticeably after ~15 wears. I don't typically like the dropped shoulder look because I have sloped shoulders already, but this fabric is drapey enough that I don't lose my shape beneath it. The sleeves scrunch up nicely to make me look less \"swallowed up\" (5'2\" problems). I'm usually a M in tops and sized up to a L for a nicely oversized fit over faux leather leggings and heeled boots or ballet flats. It falls below my bum and doesn't come up too high when I raise my arms. M would have been better to pair with jeans or the like because there's WAY too much fabric to tuck it in.Only downside is the wide sleeves make it difficult to fit a coat over top\u2014the sleeves get bunched up and there's a bit of a gathering effect in the belly area (think maternity sweater) because the sides get pulled up but the centre isn't... not the most flattering if you're intending on layering over it. So I just choose a looser coat and zip it up.The \"Beige\" is a creamy ivory color (I was worried it'd be closer to khaki, but it's not!) that leans a bit pink/peach rather than yellow.",

However, first day I wore it, I went to pull the sleeves up over my hands and my right sleeve completely came undone. It didn't rip but more like the stitching was done really poorly and just completely fell apart. Trying to see if I can sew it together myself cause I love this sweater, but I'd caution how you wash it and things. Other than that though if I can sew it back together, beautiful sweater!",
