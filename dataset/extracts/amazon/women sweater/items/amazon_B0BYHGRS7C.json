Though it looks like you\u2019d be able to see through the knitting you really can\u2019t although I\u2019m tanned and maybe I\u2019m camouflaged haha so I only wear a nude bra underneath. Someone with lighter complexion may need to wear a light cami underneath if you\u2019re concerned about skin showing through. Material is great, not too heavy. I definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered in burnt orange: it's a beautiful color and sizing was as expected. You can see the bra color slightly through the shirt although there is a thicker portion without holes across the chest. I ended up returning it because the bigger problem I ran into was that if you don't tuck the sweater in (which it hits at a great height to not have to tuck in), your jeans show through! So rather than just skin tones on the mid section, there's blue that shows through at the bottom of the crochet. Maybe not a big deal for some people, but it was distracting to me - not quite worth keeping this otherwise cute sweater!",

There isn't much difference between the two and I like having one that is a little snug and one that I can layer t-shirts and camis under. The yarn they used is super soft and the pattern is very pretty. The sleeves are really cute - there's a different pattern on them. And they both washed in the machine on delicate - very good. Overall, I definitely recommend these sweaters.",

These tops fit wonderfully, not too skimpy yet not oversized. They are just the right weight, as well. The knit is open but not too see-through. The neckline sits perfectly, not too high or too low. When choosing a color, rely on the picture rather than the name of the color. \"Apricot\" is an oatmeal color. \"Red\" is orange.",
