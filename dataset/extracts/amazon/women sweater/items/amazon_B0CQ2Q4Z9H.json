I also like the elastic waist and the fact that it can be machine-washed. The cut-out pattern sets this cardigan apart from the others. It's well-made and the buttons and buttonholes are easy to close. The scalloped hem on the bottom and the sleeves give this cardigan a femininity that I enjoy. The fit is as expected.",

The color and look of it are representative of the stock photo, maybe a tad brighter. I usually get mediums or larges. I probably should have gone with the large on this one. The sleeves are comfortable, but when I button up the sweater, it's a little tight around the middle. The cardigan looks nice unbuttoned.",

It is very comfortable to wear, washes up nicely (I did line dry it), and runs true to size. I have a long torso, and was a little worried this might be too short. I'm pleased to say it is not.

She likes the design and found it fashionable, but feels that it is more suitable for women who are thinner. Due to her upper body size, she will need to wear the sweater open, as the buttons tend to pull too much due to her size. Also, as the sweater is made of mesh, it is better to wear something underneath it. Despite this, the quality of the sweater is good and it is well-made. It has a stylish and fun flair to it.",

With the extra size, there's no straining at the buttons. You will need a cami or tank, for sure, because of the lacy knit, and also because ( on me, at 5'10\"), the last button closes an inch or so above the waist of my slacks, so no cami = bare tummy.",
