For under 20 bucks, this is a steal. Appears well made and breathable. This is mostly summer/spring wear, so currently not the right weather to try it on. But overall, it looks good, feels soft and fits true to size. You can wear the top by itself or wear this as a set. It'll work either way. Would def. recommend this!",

I saw in the product page pictures that the design had lots of small holes so I went one size up so it wouldn't be clingy. It wasn't necessary. The sweater has lots of stretch and the knitted holes are small enough so nothing is revealed (though I would suggest wearing a skin tone bra so the color of the bra won't show. Unexpected but happily there was a matching pair of knit shorts in the same pretty baby blue. I'll have to wait until Spring to wear them. I would call this \"true to size\". Recommended!",

It\u2019s lightweight and perfect for the spring or summer. It has a loose fit and looks better worn out instead of tucked in. The sweater can be worn casually with jeans or shorts, but it can also be worn with trousers or a skirt for business casual. It is such a versatile top to have in my wardrobe. It\u2019s of great quality, very soft and comfortable. Although I only ordered the sweater, I also got a pair of matching shorts. The shorts look more like pajamas and I\u2019m not sure why they were included but I guess it was a bonus item. The V-neck is great, and not too low-cut. I know I\u2019ll get a lot of use out of this sweater in the warmer weather. I would definitely recommend this item.",

The cuffs of the sleeves and at the bottom seemed to cling a bit on me, so it wasn't a true boxy fit. The light blue color is as pictured and is very pretty. The material is super soft and breathable. This would be great for loungewear or dressing up for date night!",

The design gives it a cute look. I am a teacher so I love for these white blouses that just go with everything. It is perfectly made and has withstood many washes. It is true to size however I ordered a size up and I am glad I did. It is very comfy and bright.",

It's not advertised but it also came with a pair of drawstring shorts that coordinate with the top - same material. The top is short sleeve and would be great with shorts, dress slacks, business slacks, or even a business suit. It's super versatile and it is a good fit. The price is great for the quality.",

The shorts have a tie waistband, which makes it handy since I carry so much weight in the middle of my body. I ordered my regular size and it was perfect. The light blue color is beautiful and I can separate the pair to wear with jeans or at bedtime, too. I love how versatile this set is!",
