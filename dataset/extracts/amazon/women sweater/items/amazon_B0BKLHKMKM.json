                "reviewText": "These are great layering pieces for under sweaters or jackets. It has a nice ribbed Texture to it and is great quality, almost silky to the touch. The only downside is that it runs small trough out. I normally ware a medium in Amazon tees and tanks but got the large based on reviews and it\u2019s still very snug. I would recommend going up 2 sizes unless you want a very fitted look. For reference I\u2019m 5\u20194 174 lbs and a 38DDD. Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "The shirts themselves are decent quality. However, someone clearly doused them in perfume. I\u2019m guessing someone bought them and either wore them or were trying to cover the smell of smoke before returning them. They definitely shouldn\u2019t have been repackaged and shipped out to another customer. I get migraines from strong fragrance and I could smell the perfume through the plastic packaging. Ugh! But the second set was shipped very quickly and didn\u2019t have any odor. They fit nice and the fabric very stretchy.",
