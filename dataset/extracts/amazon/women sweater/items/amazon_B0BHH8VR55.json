                "reviewText": "The fit overall is not terrible if you don\u2019t move. However I have a baby which means I\u2019m always on the move. Im 5\u20199\u201d and 182 lbs for reference and the medium does fit great even with my mom curves however I cannot lift my arms otherwise the dress comes right up and everything below is out for the world to see. There is not enough fabric on the underside of the arms to be able to reach and lift anything even just a can off the shelf. This alone makes the dress unwearable.The fabric around the wrist is also not tight as it shows in the photo to make that bell sleeved look. They are more relaxed on the lower arm and wrist area. The large I ordered allows for more movement but is just a bit big around the body if your looking for that for fitted look and not sack dress. But I can move my arms and take care of my daughter so there is that.",

I definitely was warm, did not have to wear a thermal underneath as I had anticipated. With that being said, I am built a bit more like a pencil than with curves. I added a belt to make it a bit more flattering and it assisted heavily. I love how soft it is.",
