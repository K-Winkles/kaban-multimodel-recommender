                "reviewText": "I ordered twice. Once in a large and the second time in XL and they\u2019re both packed up and ready to be returned. I knew the price was too good to be true\u2026 you get what you pay for. The sweater material itself is soft. The style with the slight V-neck was great. The colors I selected ( black and royal blue ) were also nice. Now here was my problem\u2026 first the sleeve and the shoulder seams were uneven which made the fit bizarre and made it feel tight. I felt like a linebacker in this sweater and I don\u2019t even have broad shoulders!! I wish I didn\u2019t pack it up already so I could show you what I mean about the seams. The length on both Large and XL was the same.. and it was too short. Not short enough to qualify as cropped, but not long enough to even partially tuck. The bottom of the sweater looked blown out, and the sleeves were oddly long. The fit and cut of this sweater was literally bizarre and that\u2019s putting it mildly. Normally, I\u2019m a medium or a large in sweaters, and sometimes I\u2019ll go to an XL if I want it really oversized. Depending on the material and style of the sweater and how I plan to wear it. This sweater didn\u2019t fit much different in large and XL and I would compare it with a tight medium with jacked up seams. I hope you have a better experience with it then I did. Good luck.",

                "reviewText": "I like the soft feel of the knit , it looks like a cashmere blend ,it really surprised me how nice these are. I am glad I took a chance on these affordable sweaters. I ended up buying 3. The colours are better than depicted.I fit a medium but ended up ordering the large for an oversized , comfortable feel. I am 5''4 and 145 lbs , if that helps anyone , and a little larger in the chest (40'' ) and both sizes were good-depending on whether you want loose or more fitted look.These sweaters are my winter staple,I just rotate colours through the week. I a very happy customer and hope that this company keeps including warm colours in their selection.I like that this company is trying to make a difference for their workers too!",
