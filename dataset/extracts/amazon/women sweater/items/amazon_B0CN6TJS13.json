For some reason, Amazon thinks everyone she be at least a Small haha. This top fits perfectly. The cap sleeves are open enough not to rub but small enough not to show your bra when you raise your arms. The mock neck doesn't go too high on my short neck and the length is perfect. Finally a top that doesn't go so long I'm drowning in it. It's my new go to top!",

                "reviewText": "This striped mock neck cap sleeve sweater was a great find! I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and style! I\u2019m working hard on streamlining my wardrobe and getting it to be more functional with less pieces of clothing. I\u2019m looking for classic, versatile pieces in neutral or high contrast colors that will mix and match well with my capsule wardrobe.This mock neck sweater goes great with my other components! And because it\u2019s cap sleeve, I can easily layer this under my trench coats or wool coats without feeling too bulky!I normally wear a large size, like a size 8. And I got the Medium size in this sweater because I knew I wanted a less \u201coversized\u201d look and a more fitted and polished look \u2014 especially for going under my coat, and possibly getting tucked into my work trousers. So the Medium size worked well for me, and fits just right. I probably would feel a little more relaxed and comfortable in a large, but again, I wanted this sweater to be more for work and wanted a more finished look.The style is exactly like pictured. I got the black and white stripe one but I want one in each color! It\u2019s so versatile and classic. If you\u2019re building your capsule wardrobe, this sweater is a must!",

Actually, it's kind of unflattering all around. It seems to highlight my midsection, puffing out in unideal places. I think I would have liked to have the medium instead, for a more relaxed it. I'm not sure if this will see any rotation in my wardrobe.But it's a shame, because it is soft and cute. I like the material, and the overall look. It just doesn't suit my body very well.",

                "reviewText": "This sweater is incredibly soft and comfortable. It's made of a thicker, polyester blend that is warm, but not hot or scratchy. It really is the perfect winter top and is very pretty. I love the mock neck - it adds such a feminine classy look and I love pairing it with faux leather pants or a black moto style jacket. I was a little worried that the sweater would look boxy because it seems a bit wide in the pictures, however that was not the case at all. It snugs my hips perfectly and has a more tailored look to it in the waist than the pictures show. I also love that they offer it in an XS (which is the size I ordered since I wanted a more snug fitting sweater). I find a lot of retail companies on Amazon don't typically offer tops in XS, so it's nice to have that option. In terms of sizing, I'd say the size chart is spot on and it fit exactly how I wanted. You can easily dress this sweater up or down, and overall it's such a classy, comfortable and flattering top. I would absolutely recommend giving it a try.",

It is a good quality sweater. I like the subtle apricot color. Not too much of a fan of the other colors. It fits well and is very comfortable. Goes well with jeans. Keeps me warm enough for light winter weather.",
