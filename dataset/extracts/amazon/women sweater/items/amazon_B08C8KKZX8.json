It is incredibly soft, and so comfortable, flattering and versatile. It fits close to the body, but isn't glued to you. I am a little on the tall side, 5'6\" and it covers my lower hip and so I can wear it with jeans, closer fits of pants or looser, if I wish. There is an incredible amount of stretch, but so far, it appears to remain where it belongs. Today, I am wearing it with a plaid flannel shirt, but I have some nylon and spandex jackets that will work well with it, as well as vests and some wool jackets. i only wish it came in more colors.",

                "reviewText": "Forest green color/ hunter green. The fabric is not comfortable, for me it has too much stretch. I did not like how it bunches, clings and pills after one use. Fabric make-up not as described. Mostly polyester and little cotton. I am trying to phase out synthetics and plastics in my wardrobe so this sweater was a mistake. I did not find it to be flattering for my figure (bunching up all over making me have to tug on it and static cling) - why should I have to wear shapewear under a turtleneck? The length was fine and the arm length went past my hands, but I liked the fit just not the type of fabric. If this were made from cotton, wool or linen it would be a fine sweater.",
