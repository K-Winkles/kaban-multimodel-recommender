                "reviewText": "The description says \u201cPlease choose a size smaller to be much more fitting\u201d however, most of the reviews I read said these run small already so order a size up instead if you want a looser fit. I normally wear an XL being larger in the chest area so I ordered an XXL to be on the safe side. I\u2019m glad I did because even being a size larger than what I normally wear, this is still very form fitting and not loose on me at all. I can\u2019t imagine how tight an XL would have been on me much less if I had gone down a size like the listing indicated and ordered a size L. Honestly, I doubt I would have been able to fit in a size L.If you really want a loose fit closer to what is shown in the photos, I agree with some of the other reviews and recommend going 2 sizes up because even just one size up didn\u2019t give me the loose fit shown in the photos.The good news is, the sweater is very stretchy so even being as form fitting as it is, it is still very comfortable to me. It\u2019s soft and the sleeves are extra long - almost to my finger tips - which I absolutely love. There\u2019s also no annoying car/size tag on the neckline which is nice too.Overall I would buy this again but I would order a size up so that it\u2019s not skin tight on me.",
