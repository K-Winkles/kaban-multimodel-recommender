Not at all flattering. The small was huge on me and the collar was so loose and awkward. Normally I like oversized sweaters but this one did not do it for me. Immediate return.",

                "reviewText": "This sweater is a chunky knit with a button up collar that lays wider than expected, but is very cute, soft and comfortable. It does run big or oversized. I normally wear a Large. This is a Medium and I could have worn a small in this sweater. I normally wear a Medium or Large in Prettygarden clothes. It is a warm sweater with a boxy style. It will not cover your hips, but it isn\u2019t cropped. The Wine Red is a deep rich color like the sales page. Much prettier than my photos show. The color in the reflection in the round mirror is closest to the true color. It leans more toward Deep Rust than a purple Wine color. It didn\u2019t bleed when hand washed, so I put it in a mesh bag and washed with some dark clothes, tumbled dry. Looks beautiful. For reference I am 5\u20193\u201d tall, 150 pounds, 41-31-41. I have worn it several times, it looks good with jeans or skirts. I took it from the laundry basket to take photos so you can see how it fits. The arms are long on me so they should fit others well.",

It lays in an awkward cropped length that doesn't look purposeful but boxy & slightly awkward. I gave it to my daughter who is 4 inches shorter with a more average torso length and it looked great on her. I would say average height women will love this; tall ladies, beware.",
