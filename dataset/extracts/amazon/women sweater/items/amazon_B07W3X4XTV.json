This dress is comfortable, stretchy, and thick quality. The back show cases the top of your back with a strap connecting the shoulders. The open back does not go very low even when shoulders are showing. You could get away with a strapless bra that hooks together.",

This is a light one that is warm but still hugs your body. Who wants a bulky dress that makes you sweat when you are dressing up comfy-sexy? NOT ME. The material is great, and not cheap at all. It\u2019s more of a sophisticated sweater dress. My surprise is the sizing feedback. I am 5\u20194, slim but fit, and 120lbs. I bought a few sizes, and settled on the large. Depending on what look you want, depends on the size. Although the small fit me well, it wasn\u2019t a comfy fit. It was more a sweater bodycon dress that\u2019s tight to every curve. I wanted a comfy-sexy look, with off shoulders and some bunching for a more sweater appeal. The large did that for me. Happy with the purchase! Great sweater dress.",
