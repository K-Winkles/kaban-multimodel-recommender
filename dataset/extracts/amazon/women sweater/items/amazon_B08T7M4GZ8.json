The large is just right for me: not too big but quite roomy (I am 5'6\", 155 lbs). A great casual throw on over tanks or tees that washes great (tumble low)! I am really looking forward to wearing it a LOT more as the weather gets colder! An A+ on this one.",

The knit is very soft, and quite thick, so it is a warm sweater. The navy is a true navy and looks very smart. It did have a chemical? smell, so I washed it immediately using cold water, but ended up putting it on regular heat in my dryer by accident. It retains its shape with no shrinking or distortion. It may pill/shed a bit, but nothing major that I have noticed so far to make this look \"worn\" from washing. It does look more expensive in fabrication than similarly priced sweaters I have owned. I will likely look for another in a different colourway!",
