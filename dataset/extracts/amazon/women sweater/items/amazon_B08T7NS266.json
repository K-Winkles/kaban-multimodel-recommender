I haven\u2019t read the washing instructions so I\u2019ve just washed it normally with my other clothes and hung it to dry just to be safe of shrinking since like I said I was too lazy to read the label to see if it would shrink or not. But yea\u2026 it\u2019s a nice comfortable top for a good price. True to size.",
