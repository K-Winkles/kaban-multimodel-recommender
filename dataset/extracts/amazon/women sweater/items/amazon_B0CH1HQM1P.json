I can wear it, but it is snug in the arms, and they do not stretch. It is fine for around the house. The pink one came much later, and fit perfect with a little extra room in the arms. They are both soft and they have not shrunk after washing and drying. So, I'm not sure if they came from two different places or what. If I order again, I might order a medium to be on the safe side.",

Didn't expect much and was fully prepared to be disappointed and have to send them back, but these turned out to be really good - especially considering the low price point. The sweater seems kinda thin, but there's a nice fleecey lining inside that helps keep in the heat, and I've worn them during the particularly cold January we've had this year and this sweater has kept me warm. Fits perfect to size, is very comfortable and has been washed several times now without issues.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this sweatshirt in the navy blue in large because I wanted to be sure it would fit before I bought more. When I received it, the fit was good, a little loose at the hips but I bought to wear around the house so I want it comfortable. I'm 5'2\" and 137#, so even though it looked short in the online photo, the length came just to the bottom of my hips, arms were a little long, but that is usual for me. It is lightweight and soft. So...I ordered two more because the price was really good. I ordered the white and the steel gray. Both were larger than the original one I ordered. The white was about an inch wider, the gray was 2\" wider under the arms and at the hips. I don't know if it was labeled wrong, but seemed more like an XL. There is definitely no quality control on the sizes! I'll keep the white and hope it will shrink a little if I wash it in really hot water, the gray has to go back.",

I washed it and am using it myself for the winter - plenty room to put other things under it. The length is fine for me (I am under 5') but shouldn't be as I always buy a size small or extra small in clothes. The width is overly generous. Color is very pretty. Quality is pretty good. Very comfortable, but the fit might be more suitable for a shorter, stockier person.",
