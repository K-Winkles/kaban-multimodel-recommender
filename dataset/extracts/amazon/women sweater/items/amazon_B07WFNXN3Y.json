The quality of the material is great. The weave is tight, and the sweater is resistant to pilling. I would say the fit pretty true to size. I like the cotton as sometimes blends make me a little itchy. For laundering I wash in a machine and lay flat to dry. Sometimes I put it in the dryer after it air dries to fluff it up a bit. The shrink and fading are minimal, if any. This is a more casual sweater in my opinion, looks cute with jeans.",

                "reviewText": "It's not too low cut, and it fits nicely across the shoulders. I have to turn the cuffs up once, but that's nothing new. I don't like poly in my sweaters, so this is a nice 100% cotton choice. It's the perfect weight for indoors in the cold weather. Not as soft as acrylic or rayon, but I don't mind that, because it's breathable. I bought the green and will buy another color.",
