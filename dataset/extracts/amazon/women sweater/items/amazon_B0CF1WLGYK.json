The cardigans are so soft that I worry about washing them. Some of the button holes are very soft so and easy to pull the fibres while trying to button. The REAL issue I have with might be more so with Amazon. The return information says that it is eligible for a FULL refund BUT the customer has to pay for shipping. Like a lot of people I do not dissect the returning information, I just glance to see that it is eligible for a full return and I continue. I generally feel safe and protected buying on Amazon but am not thrilled to have to pay for return shipping. **If you decide to keep the cardigans, they will offer you a 30% refund**.",
