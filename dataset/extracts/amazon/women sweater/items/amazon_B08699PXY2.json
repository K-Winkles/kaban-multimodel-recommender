Turns out that the top is soft and stretchy; it'll be great for layering in the winter and for wearing on its own as the weather turns warmer. The sleeves and body are long enough - the sleeves come all the way down to cover my wrists, and the body is staying tucked in, which are things I struggle with... so yay! The top fits snugly to my body, but it's not tight or uncomfortable. The turtleneck is also snug but not strangling. If you don't like your clothes to touch or rub on your neck, this top is not for you. If, on the other hand, you like your turtlenecks to actually look good and stay put, you should be pleased with the top. Oh, and I love the medium grey color! (I'm 5'7\" and weigh 155-160 lbs, depending on the day, usually off-the-rack medium size, if that helps anyone.)",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I gave away the Navy large, and sent back the Navy medium because it was a bit too big also. Ordered the small in the black and leaf color and it is very clingy, hugging the torso everywhere. Sending it back. It\u2019s a nice thin turtleneck if you can find a size that fits. Maybe the different colors fit differently.The material is very nice. Lightweight, soft, a little stretchy, opaque, comfortable, saturated colors. The fit is \u201cclassic\u201d, which means that it doesn\u2019t hug your middle. It\u2019s comfortably fitting through the shoulders, arms, and bust, and loose around the waist. Looks good layered or tucked in. It washes well in the washer and dryer, and doesn\u2019t wrinkle. I ordered a large instead of my usual medium, because a lot of Amazon Essentials run small. I\u2019m going to get others in medium though.",

Color is rich, alike with the picture and it's very soft. Seams are tight, neck is not annoyingly so, and that is a plus! I will inspect again after laundering, however I do not anticipate any issues. Nice base layer for colder temps without heaviness or high price. Recommend.",

However, after trying it for less than 6 minutes! i must send it back bcz it is so uncomfortable under the armpits--tho the rest of the fit is normal.I HAVE ONE SERIOUS COMPLAINT!I ordered navy blue with WHITE DOTS--and received navy blue with all very very BROWN dots.",
