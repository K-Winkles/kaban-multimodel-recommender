The fit matches the picture and the sleeves are loose fitting. The knit is a very soft acrylic blend.The crew neck is loose, not tight, so another plus for me. There is a beautiful semi open knit edging along the neck. Really dresses up an otherwise simple sweater. It pairs well with dress pants or skirt and is cute as heck with jeans. Very, very happy with purchase. I highly recommend this sweater.",
