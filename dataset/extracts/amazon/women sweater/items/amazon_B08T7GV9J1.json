I can see where if you\u2019re not careful it would become too stretched out but that\u2019s just fabric care 101. The burnt copper color is amazing for all seasons, not just fall! Pair with light or dark jeans with a pop of gold accessories and that\u2019s it, you\u2019re done! Instant outfit that looks put together but not that you tried hard at all! I own this sweater in this color and the beige, and am very happy with it!True to size; I am wearing and xsmall. I normally wear xsmall, 0-2 size clothing and it fits perfectly. The length is superb as well! Not short like most sweaters seem to be made these days!",

After reviewing a few other sweaters, this one looked decent. It's softer than expected, medium-weight (which is great for MN winter), and fits well.I got an XS and I'm 4'11\" and about 93 lbs. The sleeves a bit long but I folded the ends once and it looks good. Overall fit is nice.We'll see how it looks after a few wears pre and post-wash!",

Fit was Exactly as expected in a small, For reference, I am 5\u2019,5\u201d tall and 125 pounds. I can easily get a thin crew neck under it so it is great for layering. It breathes well and it washed up so good. I ordered more colors. I first got it in the gray which is a nice soft light gray and then I got the caramel colour and it is beautiful. Colour did not fade in the wash washed in cold water. I also dried it on medium heat with no shrinkage. Perfect!",
