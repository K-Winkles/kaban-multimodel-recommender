I will be ordering this in more colors for sure! I just got it today but I know this will be my go to this season for lounging as well as being out and about. It could easily be dressed up or down and I love the Porpoise color I got (see photos). Originally I thought this came in a set but I still thinks its worth the price for just the sweater and I plan to order the shorts anyway. I got the medium and it fit true to size and so flattering. I am 5ft 2 and about 140lbs being heavier in my legs/hips. I generally wear a small/medium on top depending on the style and a large/XL on bottom. Definitely will be getting more colors!!",

The photo depicts an almost baby pink shade but the actual product I received is a warm rose tone. I enjoy the fabric and fit of the sweater but I am super disappointed with the color which was what I was most excited about. For the price, I really think the color should be depicted in a more accurate way.",
