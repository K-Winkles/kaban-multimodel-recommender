We moved from the South, so my wardrobe was not very warm. I supplemented with beefy cardigans, but there's nothing like a beautiful pullover. It's been pretty cold this winter, too, so I got a couple of these sweaters to fight the chill. I absolutely love the dark gray and forest green. I wear plus size clothing and the 4x was perfect -- both long enough with a comfortable fit and warm! No, it's not wool, but it doesn't have to be with this weight! A great buy and lovely quality.",

Very good looking and better quality than you\u2019d expect for $27.00 I didn\u2019t expect it to be soft, hence the 4 stars ,because if you like super soft this isn\u2019t that. It feels really comfortable and it\u2019s the softness you\u2019d expect for a cable knit. Not soft like cashmere. ( I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019d ask me to rate the softness so I struggled with that part of the rating)Anyway,I\u2019d highly recommend.",

Came down long enough to cover my stomach which is how I like it. I bought two more one in pink and one in off white. Off white was great, pink was alot more vibrant pink than the picture. I am hoping with washes it might dull a little. The problem with the pink one is at the neck. While the other two I ordered, the turtleneck folded over very nicely at the top, the pink was very \"loose\" and it just kind of flops loosely down. May try to do some sewing and fold the bottom under and tack it. Dont think I'd wear it otherwise.",

I love the pastel pink color and the warmth of the sweater itself cannot be denied. My one major complaint is that this is definitely a turtleneck that has to be turned back against your face, and I kept thinking on initial wear that it was a good thing I didn't have much on my face besides rose water pre-treatment and rose care moisturizer by N***A... and that it was a good thing I didn't have any foundation or blush on as I normally would--IOW NO COLOR! (except for my brows, which is an absolute necessity for me to have applied at all times) I would recommend sizing down at least one size if you're like me--sometimes a 10 or maybe a 12",
