Framing the face it enhances the silhouette of the sweatshirt top creating a more defined feminine blouson. It doesn't wear cumbersome it feels elegant. My favorite sweat top ever. Soft cozy fabric that's not overweight or smothering just perfect. Now about the sleeve length your mind arrives on a very bitter cold day and I thought this isn't going to work for me but you know what it does! And if it's better in your under your winter coat that's a little dress you look I can't wait to buy some kind of fashionable chains I lost Chanel just for the sweatshirt cuz I swear you can wear it with a nice pencil skirt and be dressed. You can have some funky fun with it too. I intend to buy a couple more.",

It is a standard fleece-lined sweatshirt material.The color in person is more tan/caf\u00e9 au lait than ivory. It is a neutral color.The fit is nice, especially the sleeves, which are puffy and fun. I didn\u2019t need full-length sleeves and love the look of these pushed up to the elbow. Would be a 5* if it was actually made of French Terry.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to give this a 4 or maybe even 5 but cannot given how off the sizing is. I am 5\u201d1, 125 lbs and almost everything I buy in a size medium fits me as I like. I don\u2019t like things to be too tight or too oversized. So knowing this I bought this in a medium thinking it would be fine. Immediately upon taking it out of the packaging I saw that would not be the case\u2026 it was SO small and short that I wondered if I had ordered the junior size in error. I had not\u2026. It fit my 12 year old daughter perfectly. Have returned it and upsized to a large and will see if the large fits better and if not will return it all. The sweatshirt itself is cute, seems to be well made and I do love the 3/4 sleeves. The craziest thing is I ordered the straight leg sweatpants shown that goes with this, also in a medium, and it fits perfectly. Seems the sweatshirt sizing is the only thing off. Hope this helps.",

It has medium thickness, almost like sweatshirt material, but thin enough to tuck into some jeans. The 3/4 length sleeves make it look a little more casual. I\u2019m 5\u20194, 160lbs, 36DD and I got a medium which fits perfectly. I highly recommend.",
