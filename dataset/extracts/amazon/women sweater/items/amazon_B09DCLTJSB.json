The turtleneck collar is of ample height and stays folded. The sweater's design would work for tall women because the sleeves and torso are a decent length, but they also work for short women (that's me!) because the sleeves can be rolled to match the neckline and it looks great. The fabric is soft, thick, warm, and washes well. The particular fabric blend should wear very well and avoid pilling. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.",

The quality of the fabric feels very high end. I have paid MUCH more for designer sweaters that did not have this nice of quality. It\u2019s very well made and I love the fact it doesn\u2019t have that annoying tag in the collar that is typically itchy and awful! The tag is on the bottom part of the sweater which in my opinion is awesome! I am buying more in different colors. So happy with this purchase!",

I like my sweaters to be slightly oversized with roomy comfort, which is on trend right now. It\u2019s a nice sweater overall, but if you want a slightly roomier fit, I would suggest sizing up.",

The quality of the knit is apparent, showcasing attention to detail and durability that sets it apart from other sweaters.The fit is spot on \u2013 not too tight, not too loose. It drapes beautifully without losing its shape, and the sleeves are just the right length. I appreciate that the sweater maintains its form even after multiple wears and washes, a testament to its high-quality construction.The color options are both on-trend and timeless, allowing me to mix and match with various outfits. It's a versatile piece that effortlessly elevates my winter fashion game.Lastly, the price point for this sweater is incredibly reasonable considering the exceptional quality.
