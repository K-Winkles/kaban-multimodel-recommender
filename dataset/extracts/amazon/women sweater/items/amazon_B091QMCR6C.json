They are heavy, which is a pro to me. They are flattering and great material. I did get them on sale which is more of the value that I see in these pants. I don't know that i would have paid the full price for these normally. The only other issue is the band in the top of the pants doesn't seem to stay in line and tends to roll over. For just the fact that i wear these around the house, i am very satisfied with this purchased and have already been asked by many friends where they are from. I told them and they were, like me, shocked (in the best way).",

Overall, I would have liked these pants if they were cut a bit shorter.Given they are knit, they were difficult to hem without a serger and I am unhappy with the look once hemmed. I will keep them for beat around, but at that cost I wish they had been petite.",
