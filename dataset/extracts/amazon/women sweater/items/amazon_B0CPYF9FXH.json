The knit fabric feels just like cashmere. It is so soft! It feels so amazing against your skin and is extremely comfortable. I ordered the usual size using the size chart as a guide. It does seem to run a bit large. If you are on the lower end of your Size selection you may want to consider sizing down. this is machine wash, which again having felt the fabric, surprises me. This simple design will match with anything. Can be dressed up or more casual. I wholeheartedly recommend this sweater. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

The material is soft and nice to the touch, not scratchy. It is a good quality sweater.The fit is just a little awkward, as the sweater is much bigger at the shoulder than the waist. It is also shorter in length, I am 5'4\", so this was not bad for me, but it may be good information for people who are taller.All in all I love it, with some wide leg jeans it totally recreates the look I loved in the 90's!",

This black sweater is V Neck, sleeveless style; with black and white stripe ribbing around the V-Neck as well as at the ends of both of the short sleeves. This is a very beautiful sleeveless sweater that I will wear either as a top with slacks, jeans, skirt; or, with a jacket and/or a 2-piece outfit. I easily rate this 5 out of 5.",

The size XL also fit me well, hiding my wide waist and short torso of my petite apple-shaped figure that fits between an XL and 2XL. What's even better is that it didn't really shrink, after I wrongly washed it in warm washer water and dried it on high heat. It's supposed to be hand-wash only and hang-/line-dry. I can wear any solid-colored shirt with this Black vest with white lining and look more stylish. I've worn this with short sleeves and long sleeves. Love how cozy, warming, and soft its viscose, polyester, and polyamide fabric is. IT's soft stretchiness is probably from the polyamide. Maybe even why it didn't really shrink much.Immensely recommended.",

I think if I had a longer torso it might look better, so that's something to consider. It's made very well, though, I just wish it looked better on me.",

The sweater is so buttery soft and also crazy stretchy. It's a very comfortable top. It's a little long, so you'll likely have to tuck it in. But this will be a nice office option once warmer weather rolls around again!",
