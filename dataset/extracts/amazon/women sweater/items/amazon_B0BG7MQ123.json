The sleeves goes pass my hands, and usually I order medium but I would recommend sizing down if you want a closer fit. I have broad shoulders and this seemed like an oversized fit unlike how the model wears it. I think also the navy was lighter than I anticipated but it's still a nice navy color. I also got the white one too.Update: After washing both in the laundry and running it in the low heat setting on the dryer it actually became more of a relaxed fit.",

If there were other colours I\u2019d prefer, I would have bought more. I am a size uk 10, I bought small, it\u2019s oversized boxy fit, just right for me. I highly recommend, excellent value.",
