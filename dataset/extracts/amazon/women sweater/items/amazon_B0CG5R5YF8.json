                "reviewText": "These sweaters do run seriously on the humongous side. I'm 5'4\", 145lbs and ordered a medium. Good thing I was expecting a baggy sweater due to the reviews, because it sure is baggy! It's also a little thinner than I was expecting, but it's so soft and lightweight, I just love it. It will be very easy to wear it over another shirt if I want. Also, I love the length, comes all the way down to my hips. Looks great with leggings. However, the green color is not really green as shown, it's more of a mix of charcoal and medium grays. I wouldn't say the quality of the sweater is great, but it's good enough to be a comfy casual hang out at home kind of sweater.",

                "reviewText": "I like purple and V-Necks so this sweater looked like it was a winner. The reviews said this ran large. Yes, it does. I was disappointed to find that the bag had obviously been opened and tags no longer attached to sweater. The sleeves were incredibly long. I know the shoulder \"seams\" would be below shoulder like photo but these were almost to the elbow. I am not large busted and the chest was as expected so I feel I ordered the right size according to size chart. The sweater is thin and soft but unfortunately not at all attractive on me. I will be returning this.",

                "reviewText": "When you have very little money, and spend it, you want to make sure that you get your money's worth. I always read the reviews on anything I want to purchase, and obviously did the same when it came to this sweater. I knew it wasn't clingy, and that there would be a little room, but as soon as it was delivered to me today, I took it out of the bag, and I could tell it was definitely going to be a little too big. I bought a \"L\" (I'm 5'4\", and currently around 167lbs).When I then tried it on, that was the case--although it was very soft, and seemingly well made, it was much more loose on me than I'd rather have it be. I didn't mind the length of it; I would be wearing it mainly with skirts, but the top just looks like it fits too loose on me. I'm hoping to lose weight (and I always lose it on top before I lose it in the hips/thigh areas), and when I do, I know it'll just look that much worse, unless I get a belt, and make it work for me that way.I would suggest to future buyers, that you may want to size it down if you do not like a relaxed, loose fit. If I do purchase another one (I wanted to get the purple one as well), I'll make sure to buy a \"M\" this time around.",
