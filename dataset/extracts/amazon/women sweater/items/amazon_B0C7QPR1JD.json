                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed about this sweater was how beautiful the color is and how attractive the diamond shape design on the front is. This adds some cute elegance to it! I also really like the fit. It\u2019s a little looser but still flattering for that chic cozy look. It looks thicker than it is, it has nice girth to the material but is light and airy, which i love. It\u2019s easy to layer over a T-shirt or tank but can comfortably fit under a jacket or blazer. It as has some nice flexibility and stretch to it as well.I found it very comfortable but it could be a just little scratchy for those who can be sensitive. I am one who can be pretty affected by rougher textures but i still found this comfortable. The neck was where I most noticed it being a tad scratchy. But overall it\u2019s very cozy! Again, the material is flexible and light so it will keep you warm but it\u2019s not too thick or bulky.Overall i am very happy and I look forward to wearing it more now that autumn has arrived! I definitely give this cute sweater my recommendation :)",
