                "reviewText": "I received this sweater in size small and I usually wear a medium. Tops are usually long on me because I am 5 feet tall so they tend to run a little oversized in length. However, this was not the case for this sweater. It fit really well and looks great. It should fit a little oversized, as per the style, and it also has a nice loose turtleneck look to it. The turtleneck is not tight fitting, which makes it comfortable. The sleeves are a tighter looking fit but are not tight on the arms. My favorite part of the sweater are the two slits on the sides of the bottom of the sweater. It gives it a more modern look to it. I also like that the lines on the fabric are not all facing one way: the body of the sweater and the neck and bottom are two different directions, giving it a more defined look. This is a sweater you can use in a casual outfit (jeans or anything along those lines) or a more classic look (slacks or trousers). And of course in black: everything goes with black! I'm really happy with this sweater!",

                "reviewText": "This Sweater is one of the best buys on amazon. I am normally an extra large and based on the reviews I bought the large. It's oversized but not huge. I probably could have stuck with my normal XL. I bought the brown and it's a warm reddish chocolate brown. A little bit warmer than the model picture reflects. The fabric is so soft and stretchy it's perfect! It is a tall turtleneck but it's so stretchy it can pull into a cowl neck. I absolutely love it and I am turning around and buying another color!!!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the same sweater in a different color and it was not as \u201croomy\u201d all over as this one. I love big floppy sweaters, but I returned it for a medium which I haven\u2019t received yet. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and weigh 140lbs. I\u2019ve only ordered large in all the Amazon sweaters I\u2019ve bought, but this is really more like an XL. The sweater is buttery soft though, and it is the color pictured, not \u201cApricot\u201d as the description reads. Lovely, cozy sweater, just too big.",
