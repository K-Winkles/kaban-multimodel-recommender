                "reviewText": "I bought 5 of these - one in each color! They fit perfectly - not too snug and not too baggy. Runs a tad big. I'm usually a large, but like the fit better of the medium. Nice and snug at my wrist so it doesn't get stretched out there from push ups. Sits at the base of the neck snuggly so it doesn't sag and look weird, or look too tight or have too much bulky material around the neck. Super soft and warm. Looks dressy enough for work. Fantastic! I bought on sale, because otherwise a little pricey for me. I don't typically buy the same thing 5 times over, but frankly, it's the only turtle neck I want to wear.",
