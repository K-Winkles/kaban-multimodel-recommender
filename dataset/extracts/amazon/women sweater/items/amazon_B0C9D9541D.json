The color was as expected and it's relatively comfortable, but not quite as soft as I expected. I had heard people saying it was like a barefoot dreams blanket, but it definitely isn't quite that soft. It's also SUPER oversized and boxy, so I would recommend sizing down and you'll still have an oversized fit. All in all I'm satisfied with the purchase, but you get what you pay for.",

I walked outside wearing this and leggings, the wind was blowing hard and I could not feel it going through this sweater, while my legs and everything not covered by the sweater were cold. I have washed it (inside out) on gentle with tide delicate detergent and layed to dry across a drying rack to dry. It did not stretch or pill. I find it to be soft and not scratchy and I do tend to be sensative to things like that. Plenty of room to wear a tank or tee underneath. I will be buying a couple more for winter wardrobe, but I will probably try a xl next for a closer fit and different style. This will probably be warm every week during this winter.",
