                "reviewText": "Fits great and washed well. Great shade of pink and reminds me of those shaker-style sweaters GAP used to sell back in the late 80's. I am a size 4/6 and the small fit me perfectly- I'm short and it hits me right below the hip. The sleeves are a little wide at the cuff, but easily remedied with a quick fold-and-roll. Can't go wrong with this one. It's a casual sweater but with the right accessories you can easily elevate this to something fancier.",

I'm a tall woman with broad shoulders and a narrow rib cage \u2014 46\" shoulder & 32F bra. When an sweater fits and flatters, it is magic! You effortlessly chic through the day of when running errands, working at the office, or grabbing coffee with a friend. When the proportions of an oversized sweater are off, well, it hangs funny, hides lovely curves, and adds bulk to the narrowest bits. You feel frumpy and boxy, and you're transported you back to that teenage moment when you had to wear the hand-knit sweater made by a great aunt.Unfortunately, for me, this sweater is the latter. It did not provide the effortlessly pulled together look nor that feeling of confidence (and comfort!) that I desire.I love the color. I love the fabric. And this sweater would have lingered at the back of my sweater shelf had I kept it.",
