After reading the reviews of this sweater and a sweater & pant set in the same brand, I ordered them all in L. So glad I did because XL would have swallowed me. I like the other set a lot, but the sweater is a bit bulky. This sweater does not look or feel the least bit bulky. The fit and fabric thickness are perfect, and the style is a welcome change. As soon as I send this review, I\u2019m ordering it in black! Highly recommend!about to order another color. It is so soft and warm that I don\u2019t want to take it off!",

I like it even better.The sweater is oversized so I ordered L instead of XL. Still pretty loose. It is not a tunic length so it will depend on how tall you are. I am 5' 2\" so it covers my bottom pretty well. But for taller ladies it will be more on the cropped side. But not too short either.What bothered me the most when I read the review, was that people complain about seams being on the outside.The sweater is meant to have seams on the outside. So PLEASE stop giving bad reviews for that reason. Check the picture. It is clearly shown in the picture. STOP saying that it is a badly made item. It's a style. If you don't like it, don't buy it.",

For the price (even the sale price) they should include a fabric & shaver with the sweater. This sweater is worth $25 to $30 at best. The fit is definitely oversized\u2026 too over sized in my opinion. I normally wear a medium and accidentally got a small, which fits oversized enough for me.Pro: color matches as described. It\u2019s super soft and comfy. Warm. Super cute in style.I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019ll keep it or not. It\u2019s not worth $45. This kind of sweater ends up at Goodwill within the year and you wish you hadn\u2019t spent the money. I\u2019m also noticing an increase in items on Amazon that inflate their prices then discount them so you THINK you\u2019re getting a deal. But you\u2019re not. You\u2019re getting ripped and I think this is what\u2019s happening here with this garment.",

                "reviewText": "Yes I\u2019m serious! This sweater is PERFECT! As perfect as it can be. It is extremely flattering & I LOVE the look/style of it. Not to mention the fit which is just as amazing. I have purchased two of these after buying my first and falling in love with it and wanting to wear it everyday. It\u2019s warm and comfortable but also looks really classy. It\u2019s perfect for social gatherings/parties/the holidays and EVERYDAY where! I feel putting the sweater on automatically makes me look more put together and sleek/stylish. Which is not a common thing to say or find in a sweater. I\u2019ve gotten many compliments from friends, coworkers, & family. My partner loves the way it looks on me as well. Do yourself a giant favor and stop reading the reviews and just buy it! I promise you won\u2019t regret it. I bought size XL, one is a true green and one is almost like a mocha color. I would have to go back and look to see what the color names were on Amazon, I will admit the first one I was expecting a light/sage green from the photo and it ended up being more taupe/light brown but to be honest I loved the color it actually was versus the picture so that\u2019s not even a complaint for me but I could see how for some it would be. The second one I ordered was a darker green, and I\u2019d say the color is accurate to what I expected.",

If you notice in the pic they always have their hand at the hip to show some shape but when your hand isn't there you just look round.",
