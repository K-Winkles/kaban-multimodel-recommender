It isn't too high of a crop and the way it lays naturally kind of gives a \"high low \" look, slouching in the back a bit but cropped and flirty in the front. I love that it has a zipper and can fold down a bit so it shows some skin while still being so cozy. The material is actually very thick and feels super durable. After wearing all day I just fell more in love with it. I'll be ordering in another color",

Such a cute detail. The hood is thick and oversized. The front pocket is nice and large.I love that the jacket is not too cropped. I\u2019m 5\u20193 and the bottom hits mid-butt in the back and below the belly button in the front. This is the perfect hemline for my petite height.I\u2019ve washed the jacket twice and the fuzzy lining has not clumped yet so I can see it withstanding a lot of wear. So cozy, GET IT NOW",

                "reviewText": "Let me start with the good. I ordered 2 of these and they\u2019re super cute in style and function. Both are very thick and fluffy to wear which will keep you warm in the cold months. The colors (both unwashed at this point) are exactly as I expected them to be and I hope they stay that way, one reviewer noted after washing all of the color faded. The hood fits over my head and stays even with my hair in a ponytail or a bun, not a lot of hoods have that much extra material in them and I see this as a plus. They are cropped but not excessively so, they hit me right at my hip bones for the back and just about an inch above in the front. Cropped is cute but too short and you loose the function of the sweatshirt and living just outside of NYC, well\u2026 we need warmth in the winter but we want fashion too. These give you both!Now for the bad\u2026. The sizing is inconsistent. The arms on the coffee color I ordered are about a half inch shorter on each side than the green one. I did order both in the same size and checked to make sure they sent both in the correct size. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue but if I plan to use the thumb holes in the coffee color I can\u2019t because this has now made the sleeves too short and literally cuts into my thumbs if I move my arms from anything but a bent position. I did size up for extra room, something I often have to do as I have longer arms and the green is perfect. Also the thumb holes on the coffee color are cut ever so slightly smaller than the ones on the green version. Overall it feels like the coffee is labeled wrong and is a size smaller than listed on the tag. Will I keep them? Yes! Do I love the color and style? Yes! Do I wish the sizing was more consistent? Also yes! In the end I am keeping them and we shall see how they hold up once they\u2019re run through the washer but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ordering more considering the regular price was above $50. Although I did catch them on sale so this can go in the list of pluses, the company does run sales.",
