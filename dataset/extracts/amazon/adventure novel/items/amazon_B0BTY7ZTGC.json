        "description": "Award-winning author Eric Schlich\u2019s Eli Harpo\u2019s Adventure to the Afterlife isan accessible and big-hearted novel that explores belief and forgiveness as a boy grapples with his faith and sexuality on a rollicking family road trip to Bible World. When Eli Harpo was four, he underwent emergency open-heart surgery, flatlined on the operating table, and for a brief time, went to heaven and met Jesus. Or at least that\u2019s what his father, a loving but devout Baptist minister, has raised him to believe. Nine years later, Eli isn\u2019t so sure. His rounds with his father to evangelize at hospices and sell his father\u2019s self-published book, Heaven or Bust!, feel inauthentic and strange, especially now that he\u2019s started having sex dreams about Jesus. Between that and his mother\u2019s terminal breast cancer diagnosis, Eli feels further from heaven than ever. But when the famous televangelist Charlie Gideon shows up at the Harpos\u2019 doorstep with a proposal to create a new attraction based on Eli\u2019s trip to the afterlife at his Bible-themed park, Eli isn\u2019t able to say no. As the Harpos head off on a rollicking road trip from Kentucky to Bible World in Orlando, Eli is left to grapple with not just his faith and his sexuality, but also his own parents\u2019 messy humanity and what happens when a family held together by mythmaking starts coming apart at the seams. Hilarious and moving, Eli Harpo\u2019s Adventure to the Afterlife is a kind-hearted story about self-discovery and the search for truth, wherever it takes you.",

Now an adult with a husband and child of his own, Eli finds himself the subject of his husband\u2019s documentary. As a child, Eli became famous for visiting Heaven during emergency heart surgery when he was four years old. Throughout the book, we learn more about Eli\u2019s journey to fame, his relationships with his religious family members, including his terminally ill mother, and his discomfort with the Heaven story he\u2019s pushed to tell over and over.Ultimately, this is a story about coming to terms with religion, family, and one\u2019s own self. The writing is beautiful, the narrative nuanced, and the plot different and interesting. I enjoyed the glimpses into Eli\u2019s childhood, especially the predatory characterization of televangelist Charlie Gideon. I highly recommend this book!",
