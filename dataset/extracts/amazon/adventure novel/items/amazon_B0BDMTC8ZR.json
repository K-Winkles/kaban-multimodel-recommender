                "reviewText": "After 6 years in the Navy followed by another 25 in the Air Force. I have thoroughly enjoyed both the Marine side as the Navy side. While in the Navy I started out as a communication electrocution and was probably in every compartment on the ship at one time or another.I switched to the department and ran a 14 man crew driving the tractors starting and moving aircraft.Navy reserves saw me as a flight engineer on a P2v.after a 7 year break I was a firefighter/ Paramedic on the city of Colorado Springs Fire Department and went into the Air Force as Firefighter. I made E7 ( Master Sgt) and became Deputy Fire Chief at Peterson AFB in Colorado. Serving during Vet Nam and being sent to Kuait for the oil well fires I can see in my mind what they saw in some small way. Your books are very well written and place the reader as though you are there. I feel I am standing on the bridge looking over the South Pacific or in the jungle while reading. Have even been aboard several American WWII subs and a German U- boat.Several Destroyers and cruisers, plus 2 Battle ships. This read has been a great very visual trip for this old guy of 81. Thank you so much. Dennis Flynn USS Hancock CVA - 19 launched in early 1944",
