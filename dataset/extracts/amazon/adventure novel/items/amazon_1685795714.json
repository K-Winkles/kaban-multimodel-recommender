Personally I am not an overly big fan of almost volume long fights, but as far as such scenes go it was a decent read with some interesting character developments and moments for many to shine. I especially liked how the Man God was depicted, it made sense. The after stories were not my cup of tea, but I just don't like flashbacks about the villains. Still, a good volume and looking forward to the final volume of the series.",
