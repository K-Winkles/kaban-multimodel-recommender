                "reviewText": "As I sit here looking over the questions that best describe this book, I realize that just one word is inaccurate in some of those questions. For example, describe the plot - some twists and full of surprises; the mood - hopeful, suspenseful, thoughtful and a little dark; the characters - developed and complex. To understand why I say this, you have to read the story. Stinnett's books are not easy to write about as almost all of the story or stories is the story, leaving no avenue to cover without giving something away. Also, by the time you finish reading about a new character, you know about 85 to 95% about that character; the rest you will find out in another book, if they live that long. One of the qualities I like about his books, you have no idea what character(s) will show up in another book.This book did start out slow only because he was giving background info about Jesse and some of his most trusted friends. Once you realize this, at least to me, it was no longer slow. And something told me to start keeping tract of who and what these friends and enemies knew and did and I was right! And I advise you to do this for EVERY ONE OF HIS BOOKS.That being said, I enjoyed reading this book as I did all of them. After being in the marines for so long, Jesse had mixed feelings about retiring, but knew in his heart it was time. He moves to the Keys and, after being mistaken for a Captain, he decides to buy a boat and charters diving and fishing trips. However, before he can get started, something bad happens that he feels he personally has to take care of. Thus begins the exciting and suspenseful story of Jesse after the marines. That is all you get. Sorry can't and won't give anything away that happened in this story!!This book took a turn, no, a couple of turns that I did not see coming. It kept me glued to the story to see what was going to happen next. Some of the turns were dark, in a bad but good way?! After you read the book you will agree but disagree with that statement just as I did when I wrote it. Then read the rest of his books in this series as you don't know what is going to happen at the turn of a page. This is my review for all of the books in this series, because everything I said above holds true for all of his stories. ( I will say this, You Will Hate to Love Book 2!!!) And while you wait for the 8th book (or whatever book you may be waiting for after reading this review) start his new series about Charity Styles, first book titled \"Merciless Charity.\" No I will not tell you who she is, but you are going to LOVE this series too!!!!HAPPY READS",

                "reviewText": "These books are so satisfying on so many levels that once I finished the last one I floundered around and spent a couple of depressing weeks unable to find any book that engaged me. They're set in the Florida Keys so there's that background of tropical water. I've owned two sailboats and lived aboard them and am a certified diver, so that aspect answered a soul-deep love. Then, the hero owns his own island (my ultimate fantasy) and it's a kind of fortress of solitude that eventually morphs into a home and training ground for the warrior group. So, just the background setting of these novels was enough to keep me involved. Then there's the group of warriors, their kinship and loyalty to each other - they're the best of humanity. This particular book involves a wounded warrior and he is portrayed beautifully and with great heart. I was more invested in these characters than any book I can remember reading in this genre. Finally, there's the action/adventure; just excellent action that's based on excellent strategy rather than superior firepower. Great stories involving terrorists, treasure hunts, drug lords - all real elements in that area. Perfect pacing. I think what appealed to me so much is that when the pacing slowed, the gorgeous setting kept the story from flagging - I was still as involved as during the most suspenseful action moments.McDermitt is a retired 20-year Special Ops veteran who buys a drool-worthy boat and settles in the Florida Keys to try his hand at charter fishing. Events lead him to an alliance (and friendship) with a DHS Special Ops group to counter terrorism in the area. In this instance, a bad higher-up in DHS seeks revenge against the group.There are a few continuity errors over the course of the books (maybe half a dozen altogether), nothing major, just minor description changes. Also, for real boating people, Stinnett has a desalinization unit on the boat and eventually on the island, but it's actually really bad for you and dangerous to drink desalinized (RO) water unless it's remineralized with calcium and magnesium. That kept bothering me. Those are such minor issues compared to my complete enjoyment that I feel petty bringing them up.Every book I've tried to read since this one felt like it lacked some essential component. Because these books were just that satisfying and thrilling.",

Having read Wayne Stinnett's other two books, Fallen Palm and Fallen Hunter, my anticipation was getting the better of me, and I had a peek before I went under the knife!Well It lived up to expectations and some. Like the other two books, set in the Florida Keys it was about the American Homeland Service, above the FBI (which, being English, I'd never heard of!) I got to it again after my op and finished it in a day and a half despite feeling under the weather because I couldn't put it down. Action packed adventure. And I would highly recommend it.But then I knew it would be good!",
