                "reviewText": "The cover art takes you back to the Saturday morning cartoon, but unfortunately, the interior art is not nearly as good. The story is decent, so you'll have to decide what matters to you. However, what bugs me most is the fact that I had to return my copies twice because Amazon continues to ship books and graphic novels like these in bubble bags. The result? They get bent and creased, sometime significantly during shipping. It's unacceptable to the point that unless the publisher provides their product boarded or shrink-wrapped to Amazon, expect to receive damaged goods.",

While the cartoon itself stirred the imagination - the art in this book looks like no care went into it at all.",

                "reviewText": "...because in this case the cover is so much better than the content. The cover style is reminiscent of the actual Saturday morning cartoon, which makes sense since this is literally called Saturday Morning Adventures. The actual comic inside is done by a different artist with a completely different style. It's angular and ugly, with the characters all off-model. The fact that they used a better artist with a more faithful style for the cover feels like a bait and switch.",
