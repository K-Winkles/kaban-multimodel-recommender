The usual elements that make his books stand out were definitely reflected here since there were a lot of bloody and dangerous situations here, not to mention the non-stop action. But the fact that the antagonist on this book is the most unstable, creepy, and the closest to the perfect epitome of evil I\u2019ve probably ever read from his books, this books sent chills down my spine. Not only that but the danger of being female was cringeworthy but an absolute correct reflection of the time period and setting. I admired the writing style because there were times when the writing would try to lead you to think one conclusion but as you read, there is a totally opposite one instead.",

I'm not putting down female authors. Not at all. Whoever wrote it seems like they are searching /reaching for something they can't quite see. A direction, that seems insurmountable. Wish I could praise this story, but to me it wasn't even a story. Just a bunch of incoherent words. I liked the bear. I liked Gus. I did not like using a line out of the song As Time Goes By.But...I will read another book by this author.",
