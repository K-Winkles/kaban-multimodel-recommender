Woven in is a back story detailing the origins of the John Muir Trail: a 211-mile trail spanning the rooftop of the Sierra Nevada from Yosemite Valley to Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the continental United States.The tale begins with Gil, who in the wake of his father\u2019s death and recently fired from his job, agrees to accompany his father\u2019s old hiking partner Syd on a month-long trek on the John Muir Trail. There\u2019s just one problem: Gil hates camping and is woefully unprepared for the rigors of the journey. Moreover, he soon learns Syd may not survive the hike.Former Sierra Club leader Ethan Gallogly takes you on a wild tour across the Range of Light, describing its glorious scenery in vivid detail while introducing you to a diverse cast of characters drawn from his own personal experiences as a hiker.It\u2019s a beautifully crafted book, with 43 maps and sketches by acclaimed mountain illustrator Jeremy Ashcroft, showing the topography of each section in clear three-dimensional renderings and peppered with drawings of the trail\u2019s iconic scenery, like the Muir Hut, the Rock Monster, and Evolution Lake.Whether you\u2019re a hiker, armchair explorer, or someone trying to find what\u2019s really meaningful in life\u2014this book is for you.Praise for The Trail\u201cThe author shines in his descriptions of the natural world...

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Enjoyable story, somewhat irritating book",
                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I enjoyed this story. Largely because I wanted to be there. I wanted to be on the trail with Gil and Syd. I wanted to see what they saw, experience the events they experienced. And it's a compelling story - two individuals, each with their own personal issues, fears, dreams, coming together in an unexpected friendship, learning and growing from their experience in nature, and essentially \"saving\" each other. It's a great story, and deserves to be told greatly.However, seemed to me like the author was trying to accomplish too many things in one book. First there is all the stuff about the history of the John Muir Trail and the Sierra Nevada. Very convenient that Syd is a retired college professor who knows more about the history of the trail than any park ranger, and is more than willing to share every detail. He also seems to be able to quote more lines from various poems and books than I will ever remember. His lectures got a little tiresome, and Gil was more than willing to keep them going. At times their conversations seemed very scripted, like Gil was a 5th grader who had an assignment to interview a park ranger about the trail's history. His questions sounded very rehearsed. Real people don't talk like this.Then we had the social commentary on all kinds of issues - education, climate change, food production, trail etiquette... Every so often it was if one or more of the characters felt the need to pontificate about one thing or another. Don't get me wrong - I pretty much agreed with everything they said - this isn't a political disagreement kind of thing. But again it felt like I was being lectured to, and the lectures didn't come naturally. You knew when you read the first sentence that you were in for another two page rant about something. A little bit, okay, but let's not try to cover every social issue, and let's not do it in a way that seems so scripted and forced.My problem with these is that they detracted from the story. No offense to the author, but I just feel that the story itself would have been more impactful if we hadn't been beat over the head with extraneous information and opinions.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve done a bit of backpacking and found this book true to my own experience. I\u2019ve also studied a bit of Asian philosophy so the comparisons along the trail of letting go of the great rat race and experiencing life moment by moment rang true. But my probably poor understanding of the Tao is that a true seeker always experiences, at some point in their quest, Nothingness and that\u2019s one of the high points of the philosophy because it also contains the opposite bit as well, Everything. I\u2019m surprised that an Asian philosophy professor didn\u2019t recognize this. But overall an excellent read. I loved the smattering of Asian poetry throughout and the lovely thoughtful moments along the trail. Makes me want to hike the JMT (John Muir Trail).",

An manchen Stellen war mir das rumphilosophieren ein wenig zu dick aufgetragen, aber dennoch konnte ich das Buch nicht weglegen\u2026. Und ich hatte damals denselben Mantra-Song im Kopf wie der Autor. speziell auf dem Golden Staircase.Was mich allerdings erschreckt hat war, wieviele Leute der Autor auf dem Trail getroffen hat. Vor 20 Jahren war definitiv weniger los gewesen und das war gut so.Ein tolles Buch f\u00fcr jeden, der den JMT schon selbst erlebt und und jeden, der ihn noch erwandern will!",
