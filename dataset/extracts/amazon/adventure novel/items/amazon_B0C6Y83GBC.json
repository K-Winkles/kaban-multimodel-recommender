                "reviewText": "These books are outstanding. Brilliantly written and will take you through every emotion known to man. I found myself going from hatred for some characters to laughing out loud within the space of a page. Don't worry if historical naval fiction isn't your thing because when you've read them it soon will be. As a proud Yorkie it's got to be one of the best \u00a31.99 I've ever spent.",
