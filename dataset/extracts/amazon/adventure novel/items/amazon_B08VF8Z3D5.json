For me, a person with very little knowledge of sailing, I felt as though he held my hand as I was able to grasp the voyage of his colorful characters. So happy this book found me for it is a must read for those who enjoy adventure stories",

For some reason I did not realize that it is a work of fiction; thought it was a cruisers memoir. Once I realized my error, I began reading it with a very deep suspicion, but what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! The author is a good story-teller, has good command of the language, builds - well, perhaps not quite suspense, but enough of an excitement to wish to continue reading it. I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to his next one.",
