She rushed me to finish so she could start it when she finished her book. I immediately purchased the full length book before I wrote this review., something I never do.",

Nathan and his wife had purchased a 38 ft used Sailboat and planned on taking a Caribbean cruise in it. Nathan breaks a tooth on a date seed and has to stay home for two days to get a crown to replace it. His wife will meet him in the Cayman Isles and is going to sail their new boat with a highly recommended sailor. Unfortunately after his tooth repair on the second day he gets notification that their boat has sunk and his wife Grace is missing. The saga begins in the Cayman\u2019s, goes to Cozumel, then Key West and lastly to Marathon. Great story, tons of action and intrigue. A fun relaxing read and kudos to Nick Sullivan, John H Cunningham, Nicholas Harvey and Wayne Stinnet for a great story!",

I love the way Wayne has collaborated with other writers of his genre and given space to the characters of his author friends. Graceless was a great adventure and I loved every minute of the read. I have read a couple of John Cunningham's Buck Reilly series. Now, after this great adventure I plan to read the entire Buck Reilly series and to get better acquainted with AJ Baily in Nicholas Harvey's AJ Baily Adventure series and Nick Sullivan's entire Deep series. Thanks to the wonderful team of writers I have a few months more great reading to look forward to.I very rarely give a 5 star rating to anything. To get 5 stars from me means a stellar adventure awaits inside the stories. Great character development, a non-stop adventure ride; the stories pull you in and you simply cannot put the books down until you reach the end.Thank you Wayne, Nicholas, Nick and John. I hope to spend many more hours enjoying the adventures of your characters.",

Reading Stinnett's books are such a great escape! So when I saw Jesse McDermitt was a part of this, I was not going miss to this. So very glad I picked this up!As it's mentioned in the afterward, each author writes a section as it pertains to their popular characters with Nathan as the central character who ties them all together. The plot was perfect! And it was like seeing Jesse in a whole new way!I now want to pick up the books for the other three authors and read more about their characters! I'm not going to reveal more about the story because you just have to read it. But if you like any of the authors, you are going to love this!Looking forward to reading the next collaboration!",

I was afraid that the story would be bitty, but the separate sections joined so seamlessly that apart from the different characters helping Nathan the story flowed seamlessly. It was very enjoyable to see how the different characters fitted into their part of the story so well. A very easy book to read - again very hard to put down. I would recommend this book to fans of diving, the Caribbean, mystery novels.",
