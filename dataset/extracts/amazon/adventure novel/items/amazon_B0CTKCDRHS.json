The mine owners daughter, Alexandra, is as evil as her father. Her husband Buck is mistreated by her when ill in order to gain control of a map to gold. Buck sneaks the map to his friend Henry to retrieve the treasure. Henry and his girlfriend Sara go on the adventure to find the gold. Kai an Indian accomp,anies them. After many encounters in the story with gun slingers, hit men, and bombers of TBE tin mine and the arrest of Mack, you are left hanging. Is Alexandra arrested, do they find the gold, if so, what about the thief with them, what happened to Buck. Even the epilogue does not finish the missing pieces. This book would have scored higher if the story had been complete and not as fragmented in each paragraph going back and forth from scene to scene. I read as an ARC and enjoyed the content. I hope to read more of this author but with these improvements.",
