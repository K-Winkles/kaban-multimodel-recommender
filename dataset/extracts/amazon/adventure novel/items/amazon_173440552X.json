In the summer of 2021, she was watching a documentary series about a lost Mayan city. When I saw her engaged in the story of the Maya, I had an idea. What if we wrote an adventure story together that took place in the famous Mayan city of Tikal? The rest, as they say, is history. After some back and forth banter, we came up with the character of Harley James. She even helped me come up with some of the plot points for the first book. My goal for this series is simple.... to get kids excited about reading! And if they get a little spark of interest in history? Even better. Enjoy the adventure, Leah Cupps",
