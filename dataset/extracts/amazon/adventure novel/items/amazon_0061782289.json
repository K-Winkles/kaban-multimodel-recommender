Warrior Cats is an exciting read and appropriate for kids 10+ as there are mentions of violence and death between the cats (i.e warriors) and sometimes from humans harming them.The stories have good life lessons, the characters are strong and make good impressions and exhibit good morals and values.I especially like that they're graphic novels and it encourages my 10/yo to read them as she enjoys the visual aspect of it as well.Great to read together or on their own! I would recommend this to anybody with kids 10+!",
