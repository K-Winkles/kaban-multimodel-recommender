        "description": "Coral branches rarely wear a wristwatch. That was Jesse McDermitt\u2019s first thought when he found a partially denuded human arm, teeming with crab, lobster, and fish life, during his morning ocean swim.The discovery of a drifting mega-yacht the following day while fishing the Gulf Stream, causes quite a stir among the many alphabet agencies of the federal government, not to mention one shaggy canine.A severed leg and two whole bodies are discovered aboard. The find links the disappearance of the yacht\u2019s owners to the arm Jesse found twenty miles to the north, near his home in the back country of the Florida Keys.Black marketers from Eastern Europe have set up a base of operations too close to Jesse for comfort. The rescue of the yacht-owners takes on national security importance, but it\u2019s even more important to one of Jesse\u2019s closest friends.High speed boats and planes race across the Gulf Stream, causing the Cuban Air Force to become nervous. Will Jesse and his crew reach the victims in time? Read more",

                "reviewText": "This book has taken the readers back to the product we expect. I do have some real problems with his writing, still. Mr. Stinnett has resolved the problem with my being overwhelmed with all of the cays, keys, islands, street names, etc. But I am still lost as a reader. I might have lost focus on his term, kerf. Not being a carpenter, or any way familiar with this term, it was on to the dictionary. Okay. I can live with that. But then, MARSOC? Not the least in tune with this term. Then on to MOS. Okay again. I got that one... metal oxide semiconductor. Right? Next... ADD. Attention Deficit Disorder. No, that just doesn't sound like it fits! Then, LEO. Hmm. The name of twelve popes. Getting the message here? Then I was totally lost when the \"walls can withstand anything up to one oh five.\" Still lost there! Next were the medical terms. Hemostats, arterial endoscopes... And then there is COD. Sure, I know that one. Collect on delivery... Somehow that doesn't sound quite right here! But at Loc 1407 in chapter 10 he finally does get it. And he gets it right. \"I learned about the disappearance of the boat and its owners while surfing JDISS, the Joint Deployable Intelligence Support System...\" Now THAT I got. Right away! How great that one felt, Mr. Stinnett. Great going!Now that this has all been said, I would like to say that the story line moves well and is well plotted. Love the familiar characters and their blending into the book! All in all, this is really a good read.SPOILER ALERT: I am REALLY going to miss Pescador! I know I wanted a resolution of how you got him but... I love him in this series. He is part of the reason I like to read the books. Since he is a male, is there any chance of his siring a litter of puppies and there being a Pescadora in the upcoming books?? If not, I don't know how I can get too interested in the rest of the books that are written. Gotta have a dog in here!!",

                "reviewText": "When I first started reading the Jesse McDermitt \u201cFallen\u201d series it appeared to me to be a blatant copy of Randy Wayne White\u2019s Doc Ford novels (Mr. Stinnett to his credit has conceded an admiration for RWW and the Doc Ford series). However I stuck with them because I really like the main character. Due to a minor back injury at the beginning of the recent Labor Day holiday I had the time to read novels 6, 7 and 8 in succession. I was very impressed with the current level of character development and the plots.Mr. Stinnett has brought Jesse McDermitt and his \u201cfamily\u201d (blood, close friends and his team members) into their own. This is to me where he deviates from RWW in that \u201cfamily\u201d is a focus point.With this novel, \u201cFallen Tide\u201d he brings it to forefront even more. His \u201cfamily\u201d and his islands inhabitant\u2019s seem to be increasing. Jesse\u2019s connection to them is much tighter. His reconnection with both of his daughters is playing out much like real life. While he is still a bit gung ho in jumping in to the situation he is a more the reluctant hero here and this makes the \u201cdedication\u201d near the end very satisfying for me as a reader. Kind of a twist.I\u2019m looking forward to reading #9, Fallen Angel as well as his Charity series.",

Left us I wondered if I would ever enjoy a character as much as I had loved Travis McGee. Jesse McDermitt has taken over the mantel Travis carried for so long and has done so with his own sense of who a mans man should be and brings along an extended family that consistently shows us that there are people for whom doing the right thing is as natural as breathing. The last scene in this book is just another example of that philosophy read it to see what I mean..Thank you Wayne for bringing these characters to life and bringing them to us to enjoy. I read several books a week and don't review many but this series has proved too good to let another one go by without saying don't miss this series!!!I wish you could write them faster than I can read them. I put aside an interesting story I was well into when I got the message that this was ready because I just couldn't wait.",
