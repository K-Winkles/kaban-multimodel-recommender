                "reviewText": "This book is darling, and my 6yo son loved it. He laughed so hard at the facial expressions of the characters and was totally into the story. Afterwards he wanted to retell it to me and have us pretend to play out the same adventure. Great for encouraging early readers. The artwork is charming and there is even a nice section at the end where the artist discusses how the characters were designed and how they create the pages step-by-step.Its ASTOUNDING to me how little it takes for homophobic people to come screaming out of the woodwork claiming that a book is \"inappropriate.\" Two female characters in this story have a very sweet and respectful exchange confessing that they have a crush on each other and want to go on a date. WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY. The tone and content of their conversation sets an EXCELLENT example for kids, many of whom are absolutely starting to wonder about dating at the age they would be reading this. For kids that are not there yet, it is not a major plot point and they will just pass by it and keep going with the rest of the story. Honestly, I want a WRITTEN STATEMENT from all these \"inappropriate sexual content\" reviewers that they have never allowed their children to watch a SINGLE Disney film where Mr. Hero and The Princess kiss. A. written. statement.The open and direct exchange between the girls is one of the many wonderful examples in the book of the characters showing genuine respect for each other and for each other's feelings, while being willing to ask for what they need or say what they themselves feel (i.e. showing genuine self-esteem). Adults should read this book as a primer, tbh.An absolute gem in the endless search for good content for kids.Way to go Mojang! Can't wait to get the next one!",
