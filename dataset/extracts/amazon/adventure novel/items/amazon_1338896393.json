Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hallway every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories. He spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books -- the very first adventures of Dog Man and Captain Underpants. In the second grade, Dav's teacher ripped up his comics and told him he couldn't spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener."

What a wonderful book. It is amazing how easy it is for kids to read, but the concepts in it are deep and make you really think. I just finished reading to my kids the last few chapters and I read the \"comic\" written by poppy the tadpole, her comic is called two birds and it made me cry and actually reflect on my own behavior and take on life. I tucked my kids in bed, came to my bed to read it again and I am still crying. In a good way, just because sometimes you need a kids comic book to remind you about being kind and what is really important in life. Everyone should read this book, it is my favorite from Dav Pilkey's book; he's a genius that can write about love, and being kind in a way that kids and grownups can enjoy and learn from. Go and please buy it.",
