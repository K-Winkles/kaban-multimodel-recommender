                "reviewText": "(warning:this text may contain spoilers)This book is about a polar bear named Kallik. (I fogotton the mother's and brother's name) She had a walrus friend named Muddy. Also, the two children were attacked by a male walrus. Her mother decided to take them to a new home but met Muddy along the way. Their mother thought he was food but Muddy managed to escape. Her mother then brought them out to catch seals but Kallik's brother started playing. In the end, she fell into a hole and there was no more dinner for them. His brother was angry with Kallik but it was all his fault! I really enjoy this book as I love manga and also it is as good as I expected it to be. Notice that I forgot Kallik's brother and mother's name? Dont care about it, I forget a lot of things. Anyways, I find this book fascinating to read and beautiful pictures to look at. A fabulous book and I really recommend anyone to buy it. Share it with your friends! It is an awesome book and could be a spectacular book for a present on someone's birthday. Hope reader's enjoy this interesting book!:D",
