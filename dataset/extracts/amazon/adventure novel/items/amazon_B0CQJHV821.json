The criminal that the sheriff wanted him to find was named Silas and had a big scar on this face. As the men are traveling to find the outlaw they came to an outpost for supplies and the person running the place was a girl named Eva. She wanted to join them when she found out who they were after and followed them into the untamed land. There is a story behind the story that comes out and eventually things get settled.",
