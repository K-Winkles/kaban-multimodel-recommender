                "reviewText": "Excellent hard boiled detective fiction. Scott Jarvis is dissatisfied with his role as a police officer. His romantic life isn\u2019t going too well either. It seems that when he reaches the \u201cI love you\u201d stage of a relationship, he immediately backs out. Injured on the job, crooks that he worked hard to build a case against released, and the death of an eighteen-year-old that he felt he should have been able to save push him to the tipping point of a career change. For what happens next, you need to read the book. You will not be sorry. Written in a clear, bright style with just enough grit to make it real, seasoned with a dash of romance and a large scoop of action, this is definitely a page turner. Fans of Micky Spillane, or even of Harry Dresden, will enjoy the snarky repartee, the fast action, and the exceptionally satisfying conclusion.",

In the middle of a case, just as he gets some good intel and is closing in on the suspects in a missing persons case, Scott is ordered off the case, so he sets out on his own to finish the job. This decision will have deadly consequences as Scott is pulled into a dark web of Mafia operations and then the FBI steps in.The premise was interesting enough, I am not sure that the writing was good enough to carry the story. The protagonist was very caustic towards everyone else, a veritable \u201cknow-it-all\u201d and that even applied to situations where he did not have experience. His ability to survive a firefight intact was stretching credibility as well as his handling of certain situations. The book was full of action and some suspense, so if you can overlook the character flaws than you might still enjoy the book.",

                "reviewText": "Choices: A Florida Action Adventure Novel (Scott Jarvis Private Investigator Book 1) by Scott Cook is the beginning of the Scott Jarvis investigations series and introduces us to the main character. When we first meet him, Jarvis is a police detective who has been given a missing persons case. Just when he begins to close in on what is really taking place, he gets taken off the case with a threat attached. He decides to leave the police and become a private investigator where he can follow his own rules and pursue what he wants. This leads him down a rabbit hole as he discovers there are far more sinister forces at work in the case than what he suspected.Overall, I liked the story and the characters. I think the series will have potential to have some good investigations and conflicts along the way, and the setting in Florida offers many great opportunities for the characters to get involved with different types of crimes and levels of violence. The story moved slowly, especially in the first half, but picked up some speed once we got into the second act. Some of the things the characters did were a little too far fetched for me as they offered more confusion or questions tahn they provided answers. But, none of these really distracted from the narrative or kept me from enjoying the broad story. I think that fans of police investigations and thrillers will enjoy this read.",

He is a new author for me and I am glad I have found him.It is a pretty good mystery, involving an idealist detective, Scott Jarvis, who has the difficult task to dissolve the organized crime.

                "reviewText": "Yes I loved this book. I found it a comfortable even with all the detailed information. The lead character Jarvis and the FBI agent Niki were very good together whether working or loving. The book had some classic confrontations and the end was as I hoped it would be. I just went through hurricane Fiona and when the power came back on it was great to get back to this book.",

                "reviewTitle": "Solid addition to the gumshoe genre",
                "reviewText": "Sarah Conklin\u2019s husband goes missing, and Orlando police detective Scott Jarvis is assigned to find out where he is. As always in such situations, he uncovers plenty of deception and some corruption from various quarters. When he\u2019s pulled off the case, he determines to quit the force and strike out as a private investigator. Scott Cook knows his genre \u2013 he channels Raymond Chandler a bit as any self-respecting noir writer should - and utilizes a snappy, wise-cracking writing style. Our hero may be a little too much of a babe magnet for plausibility and the ending is a little conventionally shoot-\u2018em-up, but the story is assured and professionally paced. Overall, this is a neatly told mystery/police procedural.",
