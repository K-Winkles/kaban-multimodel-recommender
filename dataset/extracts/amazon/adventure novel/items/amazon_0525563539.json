            "Editorial Reviews Amazon.com Review An Amazon Best Book of March 2019: Peter Heller has written three previous novels, but he has been writing about the outdoors in magazines like Outside and Men\u2019s Journal for much longer. In The River Heller has drawn from all that experience to create an exciting, thoughtful, and well-paced thriller about two friends paddling into trouble in northern Canada. A distant wildfire is the first portent of danger. When the friends hear a man and woman arguing on the foggy riverbank, they decide to warn them about the fire\u2014but their search for the pair turns up nothing. The next day a man appears solo on the river. Was he one of the people they heard the day before? The River starts out as a leisurely backwoods paddle and inexorably picks up speed before spilling readers down its cascade of an ending. This is a thriller, an adventure novel, and a meditation on friendship, the outdoors, and something altogether deeper. As I read, I felt like I had been waiting for this book without knowing it, and I fully expect The River to persist as one of my favorite reads of 2019. --Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review Review Edgar Allan Poe Award Nominee\u201cVivid and engaging. . . .

Prologue They had been smelling smoke for two days. At first they thought it was another campfire and that sur\u00adprised them because they had not heard the engine of a plane and they had been traveling the string of long lakes for days and had not seen sign of another person or even the distant movement of another canoe. The only tracks in the mud of the portages were wolf and moose, otter, bear. The winds were west and north and they were moving north so if it was another party they were ahead of them. It per\u00adplexed them because they were smelling smoke not only in early morning and at night, but would catch themselves at odd hours lifting their noses like coyotes, nostrils flaring. And then one evening they pulled up on a wooded island and they made camp and fried a meal of lake trout on a driftwood fire and watched the sun sink into the spruce on the far shore. Late August, a clear night becoming cold. There was no aurora borealis, just the dense sparks of the stars blown from their own ancient fire. They climbed the hill. They did not need a headlamp as they were used to moving in the dark. Sometimes if they were feeling strong they paddled half the night. They loved how the darkness amplified the sounds\u2014the gulp of the dipping paddles, the knock of the wood shaft against the gunwale. The long desolate cry of a loon. The loons especially. How they hollowed out the night with longing. Tonight there was no loon and almost no wind and they went up through tamarack and hemlock and a few large birch trees whose pale bark fluoresced. At the top of the knoll they fol\u00adlowed a game trail to a ledge of broken rock as if they weren\u2019t the first who had sought the view. And they saw it. They looked northwest. At first they thought it was the sun, but it was far too late for any lingering sunset and there were no cities in that direction for a thousand miles. In the farthest distance, over the trees, was an orange glow. It lay on the horizon like the light from banked embers and it fluttered barely so they wondered if it was their eyes and they knew it was a fire. A forest fire, who knew how far off or how big, but bigger than any they could imagine. It seemed to spread over two quad\u00adrants and they didn\u2019t say a word but the silence of it and the way it seemed to breathe scared them to the bone. The prevail\u00ading wind would push the blaze right to them. At the pace they were going they were at least two weeks from the Cree village of Wapahk and Hudson Bay. When the most northerly lake spilled into the river they would pick up speed but there was no way to shorten the miles. *** On the morning after seeing the fire they did spot another camp. It was on the northeastern verge of a wooded island and they swung out to it and were surprised that no one was break\u00ading down the large wall tent. No one was going anywhere. There was an old white-painted square-stern woodstrip canoe on the gravel with a trolling motor clamped to the transom and two men in folding lawn chairs, legs sprawled straight. Jack and Wynn beached and hailed them and the men lifted their arms. They had a plastic fifth of Ancient Age bourbon on the stones between the chairs. The heavier one wore a flannel shirt and square steel-rimmed tinted glasses, the skinny one a Texans cap. Two spinning rods and a Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle leaned against a pine. Jack said, \u201cYou-all see the fire?\u201d The skinny one said, \u201cYou-all see any pussy?\u201d The men burst out laughing. They were drunk. Jack felt disgust, but being drunk on a summer morning didn\u2019t deserve a death sentence. Jack said, \u201cThere\u2019s a fire. Big-ass fire to the northwest. What you\u2019ve been smelling the last few days.\u201d Wynn said, \u201cYou guys have a satellite phone?\u201d That set them off again. When they were finished laughing, the heavy one said, \u201cYou two need to chillax. Whyn\u2019t you pull up a chair.\u201d There were no extra chairs. He lifted the bourbon by the neck between two fingers and rocked it toward them. Jack held up a hand and the man shrugged and brought the fifth up, watching its progress intently as though he was oper\u00adating a crane. He drank. The lake was a narrow reach and if the fire overran the western shore this island would not keep the men safe. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been making the portages?\u201d Jack said. He meant the carries between the lakes. There were five lakes, string\u00ading south to north. Some of the lakes were linked by chan\u00adnels of navigable river, others by muddy trails that necessitated unloading everything and carrying. The last lake flowed into the river. It was a big river that meandered generally north a hundred and fifty miles to the Cree village and the bay. Jack was not impressed with the men\u2019s fitness level. \u201cWe got the wheely thing,\u201d the skinny man said. He made a sweeping gesture at the camp. \u201cWe got just about everything,\u201d the fat man said. \u201cExcept pussy.\u201d The two let out another gust of laughter. Jack said, \u201cThe fire\u2019s upwind. There. We figure maybe thirty miles off. It\u2019s a killer.\u201d The fat man brought them into focus. His face turned serious. \u201cWe got it covered,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you? It\u2019s all copacetic here. Whyn\u2019t you have a drink?\u201d He gestured at Wynn. \u201cYou, the big one\u2014what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cWynn.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the mean one, huh?\u201d The fat man cocked his head at Jack. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name? Go Home? Win or Go Home. Ha!\u201d Wynn didn\u2019t know what to say. Jack looked at them. He said, \u201cWell, you might get to high ground and take a look thataway one evening.\u201d He pointed across the lake. He didn\u2019t think either of them would climb a hill or a tree. He waved, wished them luck without conviction, and he and Wynn got in their canoe and left. *** On the third day after seeing the fire they were paddling the east shore of a lake called Blueberries. What it said on the map, and it was an odd name and no way to make it sound right. Blueberries Lake. They were paddling close to shore because the wind was up and straight out of the west and rocking them badly. It was a strange morning: a hard frost early that lingered and then the wind rose up and the black waves piled into them nearly broadside, rank on rank. The tops of the whitecaps blew into the sides of their faces and the waves lapped over the port gunwale so that they decided to surf into a cobble beach and they snapped on the spray deck that covered the open canoe. But there was fog, too. The wind tore into a dense mist and did not blow it away. Neither of them had ever seen anything like it. They were paddling close to shore and they heard shouting. At first they thought it was birds or wolves. They didn\u2019t know what. As with the fire, they could not at first countenance the cause. Human voices were the last thing they expected but that\u2019s what it was. A man shouting and a woman\u2019s remonstra\u00adtion, high and angry. The cries shredded in the wind. Wynn half turned in the bow and pointed with his paddle, but only for a second as they needed speed for headway or they would capsize. His gesture was a question: Should we stop? An hour before, when they had beached to put on the spray skirt, they had landed hard. Wynn was heavier and having his weight in front had helped in the wind, but then they had surfed a wave into shore and thwomped onto the rocks, which thankfully were smooth; if the beach had been limestone shale they would have broken the boat. It was a dangerous maneuver. They could not make out the words, but the woman sounded furious and the man did not sound menacing, just outraged. Jack shook his head. A couple might expect privacy in their home, why shouldn\u2019t they be granted the same in the mid\u00addle of nowhere? They could not see the figures or even the shore, but now and then there was an intimation of trees, just a shadow in the tearing fog, a dark wall which they knew was the edge of the forest, and they paddled on.

It truly was terrifying and unutterably beautiful.\"\u2014The Denver PostWynn and Jack have been best friends since college orientation, bonded by their shared love of mountains, books, and fishing. Wynn is a gentle giant, a Vermont kid never happier than when his feet are in the water. Jack is more rugged, raised on a ranch in Colorado where sleeping under the stars and cooking on a fire came as naturally to him as breathing. When they decide to canoe the Maskwa River in northern Canada, they anticipate long days of leisurely paddling and picking blueberries, and nights of stargazing and reading paperback Westerns. But a wildfire making its way across the forest adds unexpected urgency to the journey. One night, with the fire advancing, they hear a man and woman arguing on the fog-shrouded riverbank; the next day, a man appears on the river, paddling alone. Is this the same man they heard? And if he is, where is the woman? From this charged beginning, master storyteller Peter Heller unspools a headlong, heart-pounding story of desperate wilderness survival.

                "reviewText": "THE RIVER (2019) is writer Peter Heller\u2019s fourth novel. It is an outdoor adventure novel of survival and to state it is a thrilling work is an understatement.Close friends since first meeting at Dartmouth with vastly different backgrounds, Jack and Wynn, both unattached and having taken the summer and fall quarters off, have been looking forward to their long-planned late August canoe trip on the Maskwa River, connected to a string of lakes, in Northern Canada. Both lovers of nature and the wild who get along well and have taken hurried river trips together before, have anticipated a leisurely time on the river, camping in the wild on beaches, leaving civilization and purposefully all modern means of communication behind them as they work their way to Hudson Bay. On the river, what they don\u2019t expect to discover is they are in the path of a raging forest fire. On their second day on the river they have a quick encounter with a couple of laid back, drunken males who the young men warn about the fire and on the third day they are surprised to hear the voices of an unseen man and woman engaged in what sounds like a fierce argument. Wanting to waste no time getting to safety, they decide to allow the couple their privacy, but half a day later, seeing the fire from atop a tree in the distance growing and moving faster toward them, the friends decide to go back and locate the couple and warn them of the fire, too. Before they can, they meet one of the couple, the male, Pierre, paddling alone, \u201cclearly in shock,\u201d who declares his wife, Maia, is missing and has been \u201csnatched.\u201d Leaving the helpless and incapacitated man behind who demands to go alone and seek help, Jack and Wynn go back in search of the woman and what they discover sets in motion a chain of events of pure horror.Peter Heller is an avid outdoorsman, adventure traveler and adventure writer. He knows of what he writes. He \u201cis a longtime contributor to NPR, and a former contributing editor at OUTSIDE MAGAZINE, MEN\u2019S JOURNAL, and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ADVENTURE.\u201dHeller beautifully brings to life his two main characters, Jack and Wynn. Theirs is a believable close friendship in which the two have some seemingly contradictory things in common: their love of literature, the arts, and outdoor adventure while also being quite different individuals. Jack is the more street-wise of the two, the most physically accomplished, the most daring and skeptical, and at times a bit ruthless. His is the \u201choned sight of a hunter.\u201d Jack tends to set the pace. Wynn is more cautious, more intellectual, more likely to be a big-picture sort of man, and the less physically capable of the two. However, Wynn has \u201ca lot more whitewater experience and he could see lines through rapids and holes where Jack just saw mayhem. Rather than their differences divide them, their differences support and supplement each other. Wynn figures the two of them \u201cwere even.\u201d The depth of their caring for each other and their friendship is unquestionable. For Wynn, Jack is \u201clike a brother but better,\u201d because they did not \u201chave to grow up fighting.\u201dHeller\u2019s command of his narrative in THE RIVER is consistently strong from beginning to end. His story-telling is notable for its clear and concise language and suspense with never a lull in the action. Readers will find themselves mesmerized by Heller\u2019s details of Jack and Wynn\u2019s experiences on the river beginning in tranquility and then moving to life and death emergency conditions. The ever-increasing danger as the fire nears them and the unexpected, rapidly sinking temperatures of an early frost can be seen, heard, smelled, and even felt by the reader through the author\u2019s meticulous use of specificity. The author\u2019s vivid descriptions of the flora, fauna, and geography of the area as well as Jack and Wynn\u2019s various actions on the river places readers in the canoe with Jack and Wynn. Those who have ever camped outdoors will feel the tingle of reliving some of their own experiences, good and bad. Those who have not camped out will either be inspired to or, like swimming in the ocean after reading Peter Benchley's JAWS (1974) or seeing the movie version (1975), will likely cry out, \u201cNo way! Ever!\u201dThere is nothing of the supernatural in THE RIVER, no mutated creatures or monsters in the forest, although stories of the legendary cannibalistic Wendigo are alluded to a couple of times. There is, instead, nature at its rawest, most powerful, and most uncontrollable, a horrendous, desperate struggle to survive, and the unique savage malignancy only humans can inflict upon each other. All of these aspects of the story come crashing together as THE RIVER surges ever forward.The concluding portions of THE RIVER make for a white-knuckled, harrowing read that takes readers from a natural paradise to \u201cthe outskirts of hell.\u201d The climax of the novel is shocking and is bound to leave readers gasping. By the end of THE RIVER one is faced with the fact that in life justice can be an elusive thing and as difficult to control as nature run unrestrained and one must always seek their own acceptance of life on their own.",

                "reviewText": "This slow burn thriller earned <b>4 Stars</b> from me!<b>SUMMARY</b>Jack and his best friend Wynn took the semester off Dartmouth to take their dream trip; several weeks of canoeing and camping down a river in Canada. They planned to rough it; taking a canoe with no motor and no satellite phone.Things were going well until they caught wind of a forest fire. It looked and smelled like a big one and it was definitely headed their way. Plus, it was unseasonably cold, they were experiencing an early frost. They debated turning back but decided to keep moving, just at a faster pace.Then, they encounter someone who desperately needs their help. If they stop to help this person, they will lose time and may not make it down the river fast enough to beat the fire. Not only does the lost time cause an issue, but helping this person could put them in harm in other ways.Will they beat the fire? Will they put themselves in danger by helping this person? Read and find out.<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>I loved the plot. This story started kind of slowly, at first I thought it was just a story about two friends taking a leisurely camping trip but once the fire started, it got very interesting!!I loved the friendship between Wynn and Jack. They had such an easy, companionable relationship. They really seemed to fit together well.I loved the setting. The river played a big part in the story as did the nature around it.The story was beautifully written. The descriptions were almost poetic at times.<b>WHAT I DIDN\u2019T LOVE</b>There were a few times when it was overly descriptive. Yes, I know I just said it was beautifully written, but there were a couple times when the descriptions were too much for me.There was one part where Jack did something very out of character for him toward Wynn. I felt like it didn\u2019t fit with their relationship and Jacks character. I\u2019d like to remove that part from my memory.<b>OVERALL</b>This is a well written, story that will stay with me a long time. I would recommend it to my GR friends who love a suspense filled adventure. I think it would appeal particularly to nature lovers.",

                "reviewText": "A building tragedy written as a mystery combined with wilderness prose. An unsettling combination. The reader is just not sure what or who will become the victim of the obviously encroaching dark tragedy. Characters were developed, but it was moody, atmospheric and way too much; it got in the way of the story. A better-written book could have been been 25% shorter and less tedious. An interesting plot idea but panned out awkwardly. The book ends quite unsatisfyingly. You're not sure if you want a little more, or if you're just glad it's finally done.",

In a way, the River is a character, an ever present powerful one in the same way that Egdon Heath is in Thomas Hardy's, the Return of The Native. He mixes his styles from descriptive to poetic to mystical and uses the callous iceberg on one occasion to great effect. Heller is a real talent and, this book a most enjoyable experience. I will read it again. Special.",

Los personajes principales, Jack y Wynn, est\u00e1n dibujados como dos opuestos en su relaci\u00f3n con la naturaleza: el vaquero que ha sufrido la tragedia en carne y hueso y a su vez ha crecido acostumbrado al mundo natural contrapuesto al chico de Nueva Inglaterra que parece hijo de Thoreau y que a todas las cosas del r\u00edo y del bosque las trata de ver de forma po\u00e9tica. mbos forman una sentida amistad t\u00edpicamente masculina de pocas palabras y entendimiento mutuo del que se sabe y rara vez se expresa. El s\u00fabito cambio de un inolvidable viaje en canoa a trav\u00e9s del r\u00edo a una desesperada lucha por la supervivencia en la que hay un incendio forestal y hombres armados prefigura un drama con una conclusi\u00f3n que en lo particular no vi venir.",

However, my feeling is that the book is way too long for the message it brings. It is boring here and there, insisting on details that are not required by the story. The backbone, i.e. the friendship between the two main characters, is not completely credible as is the story of the couple they meet. Interesting, but not the best thriller I have ever read.",
