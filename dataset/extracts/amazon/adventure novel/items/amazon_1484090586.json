McClellan, liberally weaves accurate cultural and geographical facts seamlessly into the storyline. This way young readers learn as they follow Joey and his new friend, Gustavo on a magical adventure that takes Joey from Vermont to Bolivia and home again.Well-written and full of beautifully visual descriptions, I am sure children will love this book even more than I did, if that is possible.",

No disrespect to Stine, but I kind of hate those. Magic Tree house seemed a tad too young for my kid and he showed zero interest. He read this book in just a few days and enjoyed it! I've bought the next two paperbacks in the series and just want to thank the author for a fun and creative story that my kid could enjoy. I'm an avid reader and an author myself, so I know the value of a positive review. Please keep writing these! It's difficult to find books for ten year old boys that aren't horror or comic-style.
