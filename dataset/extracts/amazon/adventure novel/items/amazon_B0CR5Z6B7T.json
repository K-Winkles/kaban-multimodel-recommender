                "reviewText": "A novel written this author is of the finest quality. Dixie Valley, a small town yearns to have a railroad link to connect it to Virginia City and beyond. It would allow them to have access to mail and to transport their products. A charlton by the name of Clyde comes to the town proposing he will bring the link to their town. Only Carson, A Rebel soldier, hiding out after the war at a silver mine inherited from Major Grant was the only one who's saw Clyde for the crook he was. Betsy, a scorned woman, acted as a spy for him to find out the weaknesses of many of the members of the town. His promises in the form of fulfilling those wants and desires caused many town members to join into the railroad movement. Jolene,the Dixie Valley teacher, felt the railroad would get her a real school to teach her students. She met and felt tender toward Carson. The plan to take the railroad right through the center of town was never disclosed to the people. No-one would believe Carson who attempted to warn them because Clyde let them know he was an ex rebel soldier. Much action occurs throughout this novel to determine the fates of Dixie Valley and its people. I read as an ARC and highly recommend to others to read. As always this puts forth an excellent novel about the West.",

The reader is introduced to Carson in 1865 in Virginia during a battle with Union forces. He is traumatized by wrongs done by both sides. His company commander gave him the rights to a silver mine in Nevada upon his death. Carson went to that mine, but in his desolation only secluded himself there. Jolene and Dixie Valley are introduced during 1867. This town is Jolene\u2019s hometown, as schoolteacher she is watching its decline and in her naivety thinks a railroad will revive it. Unfortunately, a rapacious covert villain, Clyde came to take over the town. Carson could see through the ruse, Jolene could not. Childhood friend of Jolene, Betsy statement to Clyde \u201cYou\u2019re going to demolish the entire town to build a railroad\u2026for the town?\u201d Clyde\u2019s response \u201cThis is for the entire country, and more importantly, my legacy.\u201d Why didn\u2019t Betsy call him out about this dangerously insane proposition? Betsy is one that wants town to be destroyed her statement \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I have so much energy right now, I could explode\u201d. Need to read this story to know what went boom. Moral of story don\u2019t mess with country folks. Unable to access extended epilogue.",

                "reviewText": "This book left me with mixed feelings for several different reasons. Some of the book seemed unreal or didn\u2019t seem like it would happen in that time period. The author put a lot of his feelings in the book that seemed like he was trying to sell his point of view about the South during the War Between the States. The Carson character was fair but could have been stronger. Jolene\u2019s was a total weak character. Besty went in and out of character. Clyde\u2019s was a total nut job as a character, going in and out of character, couldn\u2019t make up his mind to be totally bad or just small bad. For Old West characters everybody in the town didn\u2019t have a positive point going for them. There should have been some Old Timers that stood up to Clyde from the start. The author has several books on the past that are better than this one. I guess that is what surprised me so much, is this book doesn\u2019t seem like his type of book.The author needs to put his picture and bio with the books he writes so you can get a feel of the author in the books.",
