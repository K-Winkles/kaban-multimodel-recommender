                "reviewText": "Peak is the ultimate action/survival/friendship/adventure story! Peak opens with the retelling of the time that Peak Marcello scaled a skyscraper in New York, then being arrested for the feat and taken to court. Peak\u2019s parents were there and his biological father is presented the opportunity to take Peak to Thailand for a while, or send him to jail in New York City. Peak then embarks on the trip with his father to Thailand; only to realize that they are not going to Thailand at all. They are going to climb Mount Everest. They are going to Kathmandu. Peak\u2019s father needs to ramp up his business with the climbing company, so to get publicity he tries to get Peak to become the world\u2019s youngest person to scale the mountain.Peak is then set up to go climbing, after days upon days Peak fights to get to the summit. Disease is spread throughout the entire camp and many people leave the mountain. Some people even die on the trek up. As Peak rears the summit he is faced with a huge decision. It\u2019s up to you to find out what he does next.\u2022 Peak Marcello- Peak is the main character; he climbs Mount Everest with hopes of becoming the youngest person in the world to reach the summit. Very bold and courageous, but tends to keep to himself.\u2022 Josh- Peak\u2019s biological father, helps Peak try to reach the summit. Hard on the outside, but soft on the inside.\u2022 Sun-Jo- A boy only six days older than Peak, is a fellow competitor to become the youngest to reach the summit. He and Peak are in a fight for duration of the book. Smart and clever, but friendly towards Peak.\u2022 Zopa- The monk that guides Sun-Jo and Peak up Everest, he cares deeply for Sun-Jo. Zopa is very old and wise, with plenty of advice to give to those in need.\u2022 Holly Angelo- a reporter that follows Peak up the mountain and befriends him on the way. Very nosy, but you can tell that she does care about Peak.\u2022 The Twins- Paula and Patrice; Peak\u2019s twin sisters, they are actually only his half-sisters though. Very small and tend to laugh a lot.\u2022 Yogi and Yash- Two Sherpas that accompany Peak and Sun-Jo up Mount Everest. The two tend to keep to themselves during the book, but do provide some helpful information to Peak and sun-Jo.\u2022 Teri Marcello- Peak\u2019s mother. She loves Peak but doesn\u2019t fully approve of him climbing Everest due to a serious climbing injury she suffered.A major theme throughout this book is Perseverance. Peak battles major winds and harsh, snowy weather. Peak also feels he needs to improve his relationship with Josh, although Josh shows no sign of love for Peak. Peak is also shocked by the amount of people with disease. As the book progresses he shows a little more care for Peak. Peak has to have perseverance to make it up the mountain. This book is dull in the beginning and a little confusing, but as it proceeds the story develops and blooms into a wonderful book! I would recommend it to someone who likes to wonder why characters make certain decisions. Peak provides a wonderful friendship story of Peak and Sun-Jo, and how Peak develops empathy for Sun-Jo. Peak is an overall good book, for everyone!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Five Stars",
                "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoyed this teen boy adventure. Peak Marcello is a 14-year-old boy, the son of two well-known mountaineers, so he hardly can help it that climbing is in his blood. But when he\u2019s caught climbing a New York skyscraper, he only escapes jail when his father, Josh, shows up and offers to take him back to Thailand with him until things cool down.But Josh has never been part of Peak\u2019s life. He left when pregnancy and then a serious fall caused Peak\u2019s mom to give up the sport. Peak hopes for a meaningful time with his dad, and he\u2019s stunned to find out Josh\u2019s motivations are primarily financial. Josh wants Peak to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he\u2019d be the youngest climber ever, which could only benefit Josh\u2019s guide business.This is a fantastic adventure novel. Not only do we have a well-rounded character in Peak with a tough predicament, we get to climb Mount Everest with him! The context is a virtual crash course in procedure, equipment, hazards, glories, geography, and topography. It got my blood pumping, I\u2019ll tell you! In addition, we\u2019re introduced to several sherpas, those unsung heroes who guide climbers to the top, making the trip again and again. It was an interesting look at the local people who live, work, and often die tragically on Mount Everest. We even get a taste of the restrictive politics of China (Tibet), which shares the mountain with Nepal.Peak becomes close friends with a local Nepalese boy named Sun-jo whose grandfather is a sherpa. Without giving away anything, let me just say the friendship does much to drive the story into deeper levels and illustrate who Peak really is, deep down. Peak\u2019s classic quote, the great takeaway at the end of his emotional journey, is: \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll find on the summit of Mount Everest is a divine view. The things that really matter lie far below.\u201dI loved Peak. I enjoyed his story, and I liked his conclusions. Highly, highly recommended for boys (and girls who like a good kick-butt adventure now and again). Ages 12+.",

My son had to write a short paper over the summer for the first day of school, and thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story is about a young man who has lost his way and when his life completely changes (because his living situation does), he not only thrives physically but also learns life lessons along the way. He learns that everyone is not as fortunate as he is, although it may not appear to him that he IS fortunate, and he also learns the value in putting other people first. He learns to appreciate the selfless acts of others and pay those acts forward to help the less fortunate. My son is not an avid reader and it was no problem getting him to stay focused on this story. Well written, well packaged, well shipped. Highly recommend for this age group and from this seller.",

I don't much like sports books, but was browsing lists of young adult sports fiction when I came across a precis of this and it sounded interesting. It was a really enjoyable read - descriptive, gripping and had good character development. I am going to read the rest of the series.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this book for the more able readers in my Year 5 class (9-10 years olds) as we were learning about mountains. I took it on holiday with me at half term to read before giving it to them & loved it. It is a great story with enough realistic mountain details that they feel they are reading a good adventure book & at the same time learning such a lot about high mountain environments. All the factual things we have been studying came alive in this book. Apart from a couple of swear words (which we discussed & decided were acceptable in the context they were used, but not to be repeated by the children!) it is suitable for children of this age.",
