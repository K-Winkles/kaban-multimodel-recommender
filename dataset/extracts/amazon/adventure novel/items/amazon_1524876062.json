The second book had some options to choose, but also required a lot of flipping through every page to look for a specific symbol. He quickly got frustrated with that. The other two books didn't really have interactive components. It seemed like they were written quickly to make a set. Overall, my son enjoyed them enough to read them all. If they were all like the first, I would have highly recommended them. It was very disappointing that the best part of the books didn't continue through the whole set.",

The original series he literally couldn't put down and he has read them several times, so he was super excited to see there was a new series of books. Unfortunately, they were not what he was expecting. He wanted straight up books like the previous series, but these new books are full of puzzles that have to be solved in order to read the story, so he was super disappointed. He just wanted books that he could read from cover-to-cover as a way to relax. Instead, he found these books a bit frustrating because he felt the puzzles took away from the actual story line.",
