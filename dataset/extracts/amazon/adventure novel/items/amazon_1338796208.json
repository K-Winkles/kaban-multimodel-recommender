Applegate and Michael Grant and these graphic novels follow the original YA novels faithfully. This is great science fiction no matter if you are a kid or an adult. Super underrated series! Highly recommended! Also the book arrived in great condition from the seller which was a Half Price Books. Maybe because it's only been out for a few months. Still, top notch quality and I will order from them again!",

In some ways I felt even more connected to the characters being able to see their soulful expressions rendered so thoughtfully. It's honest, true, and just plain good YA SciFi comicbook writing.

I know he won't read this review (since he doesn't read reviews), but if I was able, I'd thank him for bringing my kids (especially Marco, love of my life!!!) into such vibrant pages. I must've taken a dozen screenshots while I read this volume, sending it to friends, gushing about this or that detail. The eyelashes. Jake's little tuft of hair. My baby Marco having such big ol puppy dog eyes. Rachel being so cozy with her blankets. AX. Just Ax.Scholastic, I am begging you to commission this artist beyond just the first six volumes; I will continue to keep buying them for myself and my niblings.",
