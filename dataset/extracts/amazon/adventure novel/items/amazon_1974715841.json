                "reviewText": "Star Wars: The Legends of Luke Skywalker: The Manga. Legends of Luke Skywalker is a manga adaptation of a Japanese star wars novel of the same name and takes short stories and adapts them into a manga. Formatted in the traditional western left to right instead of right to left for most manga a surprised to be sure. Combing Star Wars with Manga two mediums that I adored so this should be a slam dunk. With four stories all in different manga art styles with my favorite being ironically enough the worse story of them all the flea one. These stories in chronological order are. The Star Graveyard, I Droid, The Tale Lugubrious Mote, and Big Inside. All the stories have one theme in common and that's Luke Skywalker being the New Hope of the Galaxy as it should be. Disney hasn't exactly been great to Luke Skywalker gone are his wife and his Jedi Academy from the old EU canon. The Luke we got in the Last Jedi was bitter old hermit who unleashed a Sith Lord on to the Galaxy and dipped to an island to drink green milk... Going into the manga I didn't know what to expect were we gonna get the Luke of old? Or are we gonna continue with the deconstruction of the character as a fraud and a hack?Well, I'm glad to report that the manga does the character of Luke justice as the New Hope, Son of the Chosen One. The stories don't add anything new or fundamentally change the character/lore in anyway they're are just side stories of Luke saving his enemies and becoming a literal legend. With the one exception of The Tale Lugubrious Mote, yeah that's the one with the flea everyone is talking about and it takes place during Return of the Jedi from the perspective of a sentient flea that helps Luke Skywaker defeat Jabba the Hutt by pretending to be a force ghost giving him advice as he beats the Rancor. The art was good. That was about all that was good about the story. It's a bit too wacky and silly that not even sure a creatively unchained George Lucas would come up with this. But the other stories are good with my favorite being the one where Luke and Biologist are stuck in a Exogorth the space monster from the asteroid in Empire. Shows the optimism and hope that made the character a fan favorite. It reminded me of why I loved the character a simpler time before the dark times of Disney and TLJ.In conclusion, The Luke Skywalker manga was good. The art was beautifully drawn it captured that Star Wars aesthetic with a Japanese flare. It is true to the Luke Skywalker character mostly no subversion of expectations here for the most part minus the flea plot being really dumb. It's a Star Wars story true to the character that hasn't exactly been used well in recent times. Definitely recommend it to Luke Skywalker fans who didn't like how he was portrayed in The Last Jedi. 7/10 Not Bad not the best but certainly not the worse.",

                "reviewText": "I read a lot of \"shoujo\" style manga as a kid, and this is definitely in that style. I really enjoyed the kindness in the stories. I have found in my life that traditional mainsteam comics tell stories that are aggressive and fast paced, which is not something which has generally appealed to me. Star Wars is also traditionally told with that same action/adventure storytelling, but this manga is very different from that. It is refreshing, and I really enjoyed a sweeter take on Luke.If you are looking for epic jedi warrior Luke, you will not get that with this book. But if you want introspection and compassion, I highly recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "An excellent and in some cases a much better version of the Legends of Luke Skywalker novel. Unlike the novel this contains 4 of the stories. I would have given this book 4.5 stars but it definitely deserved a round up.The first story supposedly takes place during the battle of Jakku. According to the Aftermath books Luke was not at the battle, but using a trick familiar to anyone e watching the Last Jedi, he might have been involved. The account comes from an injured Imperial.Droids are being \"kidnapped\" all over the galaxy, but who cares they are droids right? Why do these droids know or care about Luke Skywalker? This is the most action packed story in the book.The retelling of the beginning of the Return of the Jedi from a different perspective. I might be a little biased as this is my favourite movie of all time. Just reliving the scenes from the movie manga style would be 5 stars for me.The final story is an expanded version of the \"this in not cave\". In the novel it was never explained why or how Luke was there in the first place, and I do not think it was fully explained what Luke found like it was here.A great collection of stories if I had one complaint it is that the Tide story is not included. That was my favourite story from the novel. The way these stories are shown visually and expanded on is awsome.",
