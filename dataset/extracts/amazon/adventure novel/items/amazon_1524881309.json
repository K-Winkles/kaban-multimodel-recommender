            "Editorial Reviews About the Author Dana Claire Simpson grew up in Gig Harbor, Washington, drawing the entire time. She eventually graduated from The Evergreen State College, despite having spent all her time drawing, and not always for credit. From 1998 to 2008, she drew the internet comic strip Ozy and Millie. After winning the Amazon sponsored Comic Strip Superstar Contest in 2009, Andrews McMeel Syndication signed her to a development deal for Heavenly Nostrils, which was later renamed Phoebe and Her Unicorn. She currently lives in Santa Barbara, California, with her tech genius spouse and her fairly stupid cat."

And things aren\u2019t any easier for Marigold Heavenly Nostrils, who has no idea how to hold a pencil. In this new collection of Phoebe and Her Unicorn comics, the friends also meet a three-eyed flying creature named Glorpie and encounter an enigmatic ghost. With magic, discoveries, and even a bit of drama, there\u2019s never a dull moment in Unicorn for a Day. Read more",

I was relieved to find this one, quickly followed by the horror of realising I\u2019d missed two collections entirely.Now I\u2019m all caught up and as a reward I was granted references to Ghostbusters, Scooby Doo and Jaws. I\u2019m not sure if the target audience will be familiar with all of these but I was happy to find them here.I was also given the gift of a new favourite Marigold look. Her Big Puppy Dog Eyes of Persuasion spell gives her manga eyes. I love manga eyes! Now I want her to always have a mohawk and manga eyes.Phoebe hypnotises Marigold. Sort of. Phoebe and Marigold discuss insecurity. Marigold is more expressive than usual.Marigold discovers the downside of forgetting spells and Phoebe discovers the downside of healing magic.Phoebe and Marigold decide to swap lives, like that horror movie The Unicorn Who Humiliatingly Debased Herself.Dakota solves a mystery with some help from Marigold and Max looks up from his phone (briefly). The new kid at school reminds Phoebe of someone.Phoebe\u2019s parents, who deserve more page time, find out that a previously beloved TV show has not aged well. Marigold teaches Phoebe about the Big Bang Theory, the theory, not the TV show.We meet Glorpie, who is adorable and needs to find their way into future collections.I\u2019ll be on the lookout for the next collection so there aren\u2019t any more unicorn droughts in my life.Thank you so much to Edelweiss and Andrews McMeel Publishing for the opportunity to read this graphic novel.",

                "reviewText": "For anyone familiar with the Freaky Friday movie (or book), you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s a story about a mother who changes places with her teenage daughter for a day. And now, Phoebe and her unicorn Marigold change places for a day to find out what each other\u2019s life is like. The experiment is not entirely successful. I mean, if you like muffins, it went well. If you expect the sky not to be plaid, then you might consider the swap differently.But Phoebe and Marigold are friends no matter what, even through the Forgetting Spells and the nose-booping, and the shiny rock with the quartz that looks like a smile. Despite the Butterfly of Doom, they find happiness. And while Phoebe gets bullied at school by Dakota, and Marigold steals horn cozies (socks) from Phoebe\u2019s father, they find in each other a new perspective on their lives and relationships.The thing I love about the friendship between Phoebe and her unicorn is the sweetness and the honesty. They are themselves together, and they bring out the best in each other. At one point in the book, they talk about collective nouns, and it turns out that the collective noun for unicorn is a blessing. That is how I feel about Marigold and about Phoebe too, that they are a blessing. They are a innocence and wisdom, laughter and snark, reality and magic. And these books continue to pick me up when I\u2019m feeling down, alone, and vulnerable.If you are buying this book for a younger reader, there is a glossary at the back to introduce readers to some of the more challenging words used in the book, like ambivalence, visage, coincidence, and doppelganger. Phoebe is only nine, so Unicorn for a Day is appropriate for younger readers, but some of the humor will be hard for them to understand, so it offers something special for older readers as well.I\u2019ve been a fan of Dana Simpson\u2019s Phoebe and Her Unicorn Adventures for many years now, and I enjoyed Unicorn for a Day very much. None of the storylines here are long, so you can pop in and read a few pages or you can sit with a tasty drink and read the whole thing at once. Either way, these friends will leave you feeling warm and comforted and a little sad that you can\u2019t have a unicorn best friend of your own. But it\u2019s still just a lot of fun, wild imaginings, and colorful illustrations, and who doesn\u2019t want more of that in their life?Egalleys for Unicorn for a Day were provided by Andrews McMeel Publishing through Edelweiss, with many thanks.",

Their dynamic is fun and I enjoyed reading this with my 6 year-old.My daughter has enjoyed many other Phoebe and Her Unicorn books, and while some of the themes went over her head, she still had plenty of giggles. This is a great series for elementary-aged kids because it's wholesome, captivating, and just plain fun. Marigold has a flair for the fancy and kids can learn some new vocabulary from her, conveniently defined in the glossary at the back of the book. Highly recommend!Thank you to Andrews McMeel Publishing for gifting my family with an ARC to review. We loved it!",

                "reviewText": "This is a super cute graphic novel about the friendship between 10 year old Phoebe and her unicorn bestie Marigold. I absolutely LOVE the art work and style of this graphic novel. I love how the unicorns are drawn. There's even goblins and dragons! Life advise is given out by both the humans and the unicorns (the best part for me is when the parents and Phoebe have a conversation about rewatching TV shows from your youth and how sometimes they don't age well. It made me laugh).The title alludes to the main event when Marigold casts a spell and switches forms with Phoebe for a little bit... shenanigans ensue. Both agree that it's better to be in their own skin in the end.If you need a little spark and a little cheer in your life, pick up this graphic novel. It will make you smile and brighten your day!",
