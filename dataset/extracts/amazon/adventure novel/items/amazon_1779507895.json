This comic tries to introduce characters that weren't available in the original series run, trying to capture the tone of the original, but as visual as both mediums can be, the painted grainy photography of the series is la king in this mostly clean and brighter interpretation.Besides that, I might still give it a try to the second volume, but it can be better if put more attention to the visual detail.",

                "reviewText": "Comprei esperando hist\u00f3rias que servissem como sequencia da s\u00e9rie animada, e foi exatamente o que encontrei! Historias criadas pelos roteiristas da s\u00e9rie, Paul Dini e Alan Burnett, com desenhos de Ty Templeton que emulam o tra\u00e7o caracteristico de Bruce Timm. Adorei a forma como os roteiros introduzem personagens que (infelizmente) n\u00e3o tiveram a chance de aparecer no desenho, como Exterminador, Azrael, e o Capuz Vermelho, cuja hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 o ponto alto do encadernado. E n\u00e3o se enganem, n\u00e3o \u00e9 porque \u00e9 adapta\u00e7\u00e3o do desenho que a trama pega leve nas cenas de viol\u00eancia.Recomendo fortemente para todos os f\u00e3s do her\u00f3i e da s\u00e9rie animada.Espero que algum dia a Warner fa\u00e7a uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o, nem que seja em forma de miniss\u00e9rie, da anima\u00e7\u00e3o, seria uma boa pra aproveitar o \"revival\" de produ\u00e7\u00f5es dos anos 90.",
