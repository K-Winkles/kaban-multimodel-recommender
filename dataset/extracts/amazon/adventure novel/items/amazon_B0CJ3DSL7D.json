However, both submarines are unaware that they\u2019re sailing into a large and complex spider\u2019s web\u2026 a web spun from treachery, deceit and deadly intent. Now the race is on\u2026 can the boats and Decker\u2019s men get ashore and get off again before The Sensei can close his trap and seal their fates? Or will they all be squeezed to death in the iron grip of Hirohito\u2019s lust for power?Guns thunder, depth charges boom and torpedoes streak through the sea in this action-packed naval adventure-thriller!
