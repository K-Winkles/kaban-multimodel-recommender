I loved how Squash and Ginny have such distinct personalities but still appreciate each other and can work together creatively to help the different friends they encounter. The story is jam-packed with light-hearted mischief, high-stakes nail-biter moments, and a vibrant alternate fantasy that readers can escape to. Everything is so drawn with so much attention to detail, and the color palette is such a fun experience as well.I've been a fan and have followed the author Susie on IG @catandcatcomics for years now, and I was so excited when she announced this book! My niece asked right away when the next book would be coming out, so we are both eagerly awaiting the next chapter of Squash & Ginny's adventures!",

If you haven't followed @catandcatcomics on instagram, please do! Susie posts adorable side stories of these two charactes and friends and I always look forward to seeing her wonderfully sweet comics. In this story, after running out of snacks, Squash and Ginny must go on adventure to gather three ingredients needed for an unlimited snack potion. They visit three different lands, and face dangerous situations as they gather the ingredients and make new friends along the way. A great book for young readers, and for fellow cat lovers of all ages. I look forward to more comics from Susie.",

Squash and Ginny are such adorable little feline protagonists and seeing them get their own book series is awesome. I already can't wait to get my hands on the next book to come!",

This book reminds us that we all need to take a break from our routine and get back to our beautiful imaginary world we once lived in! I have bought both books of Cat and Cat Comics and ardent fan of Susie's insta page. Her mini series are all those lessons we learnt as kids but forget to practice now! Much love and long go forever! --Thunder's Dimmy",
