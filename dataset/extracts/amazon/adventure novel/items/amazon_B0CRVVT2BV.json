        "description": "Together for the first time, two authors, Randall Dale, author of \"Branson Hawk: U.S. Marshal,\" and Casey Nash, author of \"Jubal Stone: U.S. Marshal,\" weave a Western filled with action, adventure and a story that will leave you breathlessly turning pages. This is \u201cThe Santa Fe Connection\" an adventure that combines Jubal and Branson and tests their limits!They had never worked together before or even met for that matter. Both marshals were powerful forces for law and order on the Texas and Arizona frontiers in their own right and preferred to do their work alone. But when the governor of New Mexico reaches out for help to stop the plethora of train robberies plaguing Santa Fe, these lawmen are assigned the job.At first, Jubal Stone and Branson Hawk are both reluctant to work together. However, soon after they meet, they realize they are very much alike and begin to think and act as one as they unravel the conspiracy being carried out in Santa Fe.Ride along with Jubal and Branson in The Santa Fe Connection as they join forces to bring to heel the train robbers that are plaguing the state as well as the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.Who\u2019s behind the thievery? Jubal and Branson aim to find out.",
