                "reviewText": "Cam Derringer, a private investigator out of Key West, is abducted and left beaten, naked, and unconscious on an isolated, dark road when he runs afoul of a gang of boat-jackers. He is found by the beautiful Jenny, who quickly insinuates herself into his life, both professionally and personally. Soon, his partner goes missing, reminding Cam of the unsolved case of his lost wife. Events move quickly as the author weaves a tale full of intrigue populated by the colorful and shady characters who inhabit the exotic locale. Untangling the truth from the lies takes all of Cam's skill as he gradually realizes the boat-jackers are deadly dangerous and plotting a much more insidious purpose. The story is told in a straight forward style, full of conversational asides and interesting characters. I enjoyed the avuncular relationship Cam had with his assistant, the lovely Diane. I developed an immediate affection for several of the characters, in particular the wayward bartender Dave, whose carefree lifestyle is complicated by his attraction to women of questionable sanity. Anyone who enjoys a fast paced contemporary mystery will enjoy \"Knee Deep.\" The author Mac (Cam?) Fortner, a native Hoosier, indicates this is the first in a proposed series, so further adventures of the guitar-playing sleuth with a fondness for Wild Turkey and pretty women may be on the horizon. It is my hope that Cam Derringer takes his place in the private eye canon along side Remington Steele, Magnum PI, and John Shaft. \"Knee Deep\" is an entertaining, engrossing, and easy read. I could happily envision it as a successful television series. .",
