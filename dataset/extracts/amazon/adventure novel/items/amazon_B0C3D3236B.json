                "reviewText": "Myrtle is an intelligent mathematician who likes cake, which unfortunately makes her too intelligent for the loads of suitors she has turned down for marriage proposals. Simeon is a painter and a bit of a rake that has just gotten entrapped in a situation at Myrtle\u2019s brother\u2019s house resulting in a quick exit. Hoping to escape to London where she can start her own business for women seeking accounting help, Myrtle attempts to escape with Simeon, scandal be damned. These two have to pretend to be married, share only one bed, and tempt each other with flirtatious banter as they head to London.This book was so much fun. I laughed so much in the beginning at Myrtle\u2019s straightforward nature and inability to hide her true opinions. \u201cDo keep up,\u201d became a repeat witticism between Myrtle and Simeon who dish out comedic banter for the whole first third of the novel. These two couldn\u2019t be more opposite on paper, but as we find, their wants are so similar, and Simeon truly has the biggest heart! He gives all of his money away because he is always helping others, causing him to be ridiculously poor. Myrtle meanwhile has amassed a fortune because her mathematical prowess has helped her invest and grow her monies. When an improbable (for romance reasons) fake engagement throws them into each other\u2019s arms, their feelings on what they want from life (to marry or not?) and from each other begin to change.As part of their fake engagement Myrtle and Simeon decide to have a sexperiment over the duration of their time together and Megan Frampton knows how to bring the heat and intimacy. I loved seeing these two fall for each other; Simeon time and again says how much he loves Myrtle\u2019s brain, and Myrtle first falls for his looks, but then falls for his heart. Being a loner is something they have in common and they way they quickly notice things about one another makes the second half of the book full of thoughtful gestures and kindheartedness.This is the third book in the School for Scoundrels series and I have been along for the ride since the first, loving each story of the Bastard Five. This can be read as a standalone or even out of order, but knowing some of the other \u201cBastards\u201d made it much sweeter. Myrtle definitely takes the cake in this book (ok, pun fully intended) with her personality and frankness, but Simeon lets her\u2014a perfect example of a strong man behind a strong woman. I received this copy from the publisher. All opinions are my own.4.5 stars rounded up.",

This third installment in the School for Scoundrels series, does not quite live up to the promise of the first novel. The relationship between Myrtle and Simeon builds too quickly, goes south rapidly, then rectifies seemingly instantly. Fans of the series may enjoy the continuation, but new fans can skip this one.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed the premise of this series: 5 Orphan Bastards of various circumstances are still friends and bond together over their lives and books. Book 3 is about Simeon, who is an artist by trade and a softhearted fellow by deed. Simon wants to create great significance works of art but has to fund his work by taking portrait commissions which is how he finds himself at the country home of his newest commission for Lord Richard Allen, Viscount Leybourne. Lady Myrtle Allen, Richard\u2019s sister is a very intelligent woman, she excels in mathematics and in the first few chapters makes the reader well aware of just how smart she is and how no one appreciates her talents , especially her brother and the 27, or was it 32 men who have proposed to her. I have to admit, that it took me about 1/3 of the book to like Myrtle. I think the author was going for a neurodivergent character but for me she was just over-boasting and annoying. Yes, she was very annoying\u2026.. until she wasn\u2019t.After a misunderstanding involving Richard\u2019s lush of a wife, Simon has to make a hasty exit and Myrtle manages to convince him to take her to London with him because she wants to set up her own financial advise business for women ( incase you forgot, she\u2019s good at maths). Then you start to think \u201cOh, I know where this is going, 2 people alone on the road for a few days, marriage of convenience\u2026.\u201d Nope, they part ways in London but are intrigued by one another. Well through a weird series of events, they end up with a \u201cfake engagement \u201c. But the fake engagement is only to usher Myrtle\u2019s niece through her debut and was suggested by her brother Richard.Confused yet?It feels like you should be.But somehow Ms Frampton seems to pull this off into a delightful friends to lovers to love story. I really started to sympathize with Myrtle. All she really wants is someone to respect her for her intelligence and to want to marry her for more than her dowery. And if she can\u2019t have that she would rather make her own way in the world. Simone is very attracted to Myrtle and it\u2019s no hardship to be her fake fianc\u00e9, As someone who is passionate about his art he comes understand Myrtle\u2019s drive as well. This is a nice love story about two people needing a friend who understands them and then realize that they want more than just that friendship.The steam #s in this is low, but those scenes are \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. I think that\u2019s this book is a fine addition to the previous 2 of which I\u2019ve enjoyed very much And I\u2019m looking forward to find out what has Fenton all tied up in knots.As always, I thank the author and NetGallery for allowing me to read this ARC for my honest review.8",
