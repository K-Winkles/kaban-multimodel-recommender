The story is great, and I think it takes advantage of being a comic rather than a cartoon by showing us things that would have been far too complicated to animate (Fractal Jake!). Also Ryan North's little comments and jokes written at the bottoms of the pages are always a personal joy.Mostly I loved Queen Bubblegum and all her BA costumes. So cool.",
