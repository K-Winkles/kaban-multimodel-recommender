Writer Daniel Jose Older does a consistently good job, issue-to-issue, of telling stories that hold the reader\u2019s attention, integrating colorful characters with witty narratives and a jovial overall vibe. That the series itself seems to be steering away from the grander initiative-pushing narratives that characterize Marvel\u2019s other \u201cHigh Republic\u201d series is less a fault and more a feature: \u201cThe High Republic Adventures\u201d may not be the most \u201cimportant\u201d entry of the \u201cHigh Republic\u201d publishing line in terms of advancing the broader story, but it is among the most consistently enjoyable, month to month. And that\u2019s not nothing.",

I love the way these connect to the novels and comics despite being from different companies.This volume has a great mix of back stories, giving the lesser known characters a chance to grow and shine as well as moving yhe main story going on in this comics on.The volume contains 8 stories of various lengths. Short to medium, but I definitely notice the main events in the novels that these stories are adding depth to. On a personal level I also prefer the artwork in thus volume over all to the first volume.",
