R.A.F pilot Geoffrey Denton and his squadron are tasked with keeping enemy forces at bay in North Africa, Greece and Crete.At first it seems that victory is within their reach, but German soldiers soon outnumber them and the fighting reaches heightened levels of danger. Having survived several dog fights, the strain of constant operations against strong fighter and anti-aircraft defences takes its toll on Denton, who seeks release in the arms of his bright, beautiful Greek mistress, Kathia Pefkos.But is he right to allow her insider access to his squadron?Or is he risking his own life, and those of his men, for a love that was doomed from the start?From the barren deserts of North Africa, to the streets of wartime Athens, \u2018The Eagle\u2019s Cry\u2019 is a fast-paced, action-filled military thriller.Praise for Richard Bickers: 'A thrilling page turner.' - Tom Kasey, best-selling author of 'Trade Off'.Richard Townsend Bickers volunteered for the RAF on the outbreak of the second world war and served, with a Permanent Commission, for eighteen years.

                "reviewText": "This was a decent read. I picked it because, as a WWII buff, I haven't read much about the early campaigns by Britain in North Africa and the Mediterranean. This novel covered that period and offered insight into the fighting that took place, the aircraft used, and quite a bit more. I enjoyed the \"thoroughly British\" lingo and slang of the period. For my taste, the story was a bit uneven at times and the battles were described with what I would call \"typical British understatement\", but for all that the story kept me interested. The ending took me completely by surprise. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the period and those who held off the Axis threat.",
