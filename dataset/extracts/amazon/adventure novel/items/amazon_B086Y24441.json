            "Editorial Reviews Review \"This is my NEW FAVORITE SERIES!\" -- Anne R.\"Outstanding Kid Series! I normally don't review books on here [Amazon] unless highly impressed! So many children's books today are such a poor excuse for literature - poor plots, undeveloped characters, even poor spelling and use of English. What a delight to find a highly qualified author, Greg Smith and to finally find a series that are uplifting, well written and adventurous!\" (Amazon 5-star review by Buzzyflight, Nov. 10, 2020)\"Kids favorite book--I sent my niece and nephew several books for summer reading. This has been the favorite of both kids...Appropriate for all kids, just good fun...Highly recommend.\"-Consultx\"My kids have read the whole series and asking for more!--My kids are very much into action and adventure books. We have read the entire series together during family reading time. They have loved all of them and now cannot wait for the author to write more. These books are full of tasty little tidbits of true information including some historical references and accurate STEM information applied to situations in the book. I loved these for my kids.\"-Clint G\"Mystery and Fun--Purchased for my grandson--I found it to be quite a thrilling read--perfect for an almost 11 year old. Full of fun and adventure.\"-H. W. Longfellow\"Great new series (to us)--Bought for a 7 year old bookworm granddaughter who loves adventure stories and read it in almost one session!\"-Reviewer in Canada\"Worthwhile books--Wonderfully written story, my son has devoured all 12 of the books in the series.\"-Susan\"A Great Adventure Story--My boy loves it.

And now picks up other books to read with excitement! Awesome, fun and engaging series! Highly recommend!!!",

                "reviewText": "The five Wright cousins are spending the summer on Grandpa Wright\u2019s farm in an effort to provide the work that is necessary to keep the farm afloat. While there, the teens are determined to locate Great-Great Grandpa Jack\u2019s lost gold mine. Between strange occurrences happening nearby, dastardly villains wheedling their way onto Grandpa Wright\u2019s land, and the work that needs to be done on the property, there is no shortage of excitement for the Wright cousins to experience. And when they explore a mysterious clue left behind by Great-Great Grandpa Jack, they discover more than they expected hidden in the nearby landscape. This first in the Wright Cousin Adventures series introduces readers to the close-knit Wright clan and the family farm they love so dearly. Inspired by a real life discovery made by the author and his own family, this novel brings early young adult readers into the Wild West as the Wright cousins discover more about the hidden gold mine with each passing chapter. Occasional illustrations help orient readers to the space in which the Wright cousins find themselves, and the pacing of the book overall makes the narrative highly accessible to young people. Reminiscent of the Boxcar Children series, this wholesome story involves close family relationships, ample dialogue and action, and the danger and humor that naturally enhance tales for young people. Fans of adventure stories filled with heart will fly through this first book and eagerly reach for the next installment.I received a copy of this book from the author and I chose to leave this review.",
