                "reviewText": "The Howard Pyle version of The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood seemed to be the version with the most editions available, so I figured that would be a good starting place for Robin Hood stories. Silly me once again forgot that I had already purchased the Audible version of the book (the Audible version is not free, but I think I got it as a daily deal or something) and got the Kindle version too. Since the Kindle version is a cheap edition of a really old book, I did not particularly expect the Kindle and audiobooks to sync up, but they actually did pretty well together.John Lee does a great job with the narration, voicing everybody from the evil Guy of Gisbourne to the shifty Sheriff of Nottingham with fine distinction. He even sings all the many songs in the book in character very well. According to the section in the Kindle book about the author (this part was not in the audiobook version) Howard Pyle based his version of the Robin Hood stories on a 1795 collection of ballads, so nearly every tale, especially in the first part of the book, has a merry song or two in it.Apparently, there is no original manuscript to base a rendition of the Robin Hood stories on so this collection of ballads may be as close to an original source as we are likely to get. In consequence, while the language of these stories has a suitably Medieval cast to it, it is nevertheless reasonably easy to understand. It\u2019s not like trying to read Middle English or anything.And yet, the stories are set in a time when Middle English would not have been so far off the mark. This collection actually focuses on a time period somewhat earlier than the more recent popular renditions of Robin Hood in the movies. Throughout most of the book, the King is King Henry II. In fact, Henry and his Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, appear in a couple of the stories. Queen Eleanor sponsors Robin Hood and some of his men in a tournament, and King Henry, upset that they have beaten some of his favorites, hunts them all over the north of England. This must have been during the time Henry and Eleanor weren\u2019t getting along so well.There were many stories in this book that I had not heard before, or barely heard references to somewhere. And a lot of the stories found in recent renditions of Robin Hood are not there. For instance, Maid Marian is mentioned about three times as the girl Robin Hood loves best, but her story is not told at all. Instead, we have the story of Allan A Dale and his true love, Ellen, and how Robin Hood saved fair Ellen from marrying an old knight so that she could marry the minstrel instead. Guy of Gisbourne is not a knight but another outlaw with an evil reputation whom the Sheriff of Nottingham has hired to kill Robin Hood. And it is King Richard who, after his father\u2019s death and his own accession to the throne, finally catches Robin Hood \u2013 and takes him into his personal service.",

                "reviewText": "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is an excellent book of small stories. One will discover this book provides an ocean of emotions and entertainment. Some of the adventures you will laugh at because of the hilarious sly side to Robin Hood and his band of merry men. If you want hilarity and laughter this is an excellent book. Adventurous excursions are also plentiful in this book. Some may want blood and guts adventure but this book provides more of innocent adventures that include wit, charm, strategy, and deception.When considering this book one will encounter older English language. This though does not stop one from enjoying the adventures in each part. If you struggle with older English read for a couple of chapters and you will easily get the hang of it. Also older English provides more of a sensual and realistic feel to the story because this is a medieval tale. The wording puts you in that time frame.It contains some pictures to help the reader formulate an imaginative image of that time. Although if you are expecting a picture book this is not it. When comparing this to other books it is an enjoyable laid back story. I laughed in many parts because of Little John, Robin Hood, and other members of his group's funny comebacks with extreme wit.I highly recommend this book for various purposes. This book can be for children to adults. Read it parts not just chapters. Each part is a riveting tale in itself. It may seem slow in some parts but will pick up quite fast. At the end of the book you would wish the story would continue but to all things comes an end. Enjoy it and I am sure you would even want to re read in the future.",

The first company I ordered this book from sent my another edition which was disappointing but Kelly & Fair International Marketing Inc. came through for me. I wrote a message asking that they confirm that I was going to receive the correct volume ordered and they were quick to respond.

I found the language much less difficult to get through because I looked up any word I didn't understand. The tales are exciting and humorous. The rich detail on the clothing and food was very interesting. I think reading the stories as an adult may be more fun than as a child. There is a lot of fighting and drinking and singing, which was all part of the joy of reading it. However, I could imagine it geting challenging or boring for children who are not able to get past the language. The writing is so rich, I didn't miss the illustrations that are not available on the Kindle edition.",

                "reviewTitle": "Uma bel\u00edssima edi\u00e7\u00e3o das hist\u00f3rias de Robin Hood",
                "reviewText": "O livro \u00e9 realmente lindo. Tenho alguns outros exemplares encadernados em couro da pr\u00f3pria Barnes & Noble e tamb\u00e9m da Canterbury Classics e esse \u00e9 de longe o mais bonito e bem acabado. O couro da capa em tom verde contrasta muito bem com a pintura em verde escuro, creme e cobre metalizado. A lateral externa das p\u00e1ginas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 metalizada em cobre. No interior, temos as bel\u00edssimas ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es de Howard Pyle, todas em cores, assim como detalhes e pequenos resumos nos lados das p\u00e1ginas. O ingl\u00eas usado \u00e9 arcaico e pode deixar a leitura um pouco lenta no in\u00edcio, mas com o tempo as palavras v\u00e3o se repetindo e voc\u00ea pega o ritmo. Uma excelente aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o ou op\u00e7\u00e3o de presente para colecionadores e f\u00e3s das hist\u00f3rias de Robin Hood.",
