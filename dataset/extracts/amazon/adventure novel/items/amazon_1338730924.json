She has really enjoyed the graphic series of this novel",

                "reviewText": "Eins vorweg, ich liebe die Wings of Fire Serie. Ich habe mir alle 18 Audiob\u00fccher schon 3 mal angeh\u00f6rt, weil ich so verr\u00fcckt danach bin.Nat\u00fcrlich hab ich auch die Comicb\u00fccher in meiner Samlung und habe mich schon sehr auf die Fortsetzung des 7. Buchs gefreut. Heute hab ich's mir dann auf's Tablet geladen, um's zu lesen und musste dann feststellen, dass die Qualit\u00e4t nicht so gut ist, wie bei den anderen digitalen Comicb\u00fcchern. Es ist beim Zoomen in die einzelnen Frames doch recht verpixelt. Ein Blick in die Buchdetails liefert auch sofort den Grund daf\u00fcr: Grade mal 100 MB ist die Datei nur noch gro\u00df, wohingegen die anderen B\u00fccher das f\u00fcnfache hatten. Die Datei vom ersten Buch ist sogar \u00fcber 800 MB gro\u00df. Ist das jetzt der neue Standard bei den Kindle Versionen dieser Comicreihe? Ich hoffe doch sehr, dass die Qualit\u00e4t wieder das Niveau der vorherigen B\u00fccher haben wird.",
