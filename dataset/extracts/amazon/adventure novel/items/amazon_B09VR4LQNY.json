        "description": "A cryptic murder pulls a former soldier turned financial analyst deep into the corruption and menace that prowl beneath the opulent world of finance, in #1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci\u2019s new thriller.Every day without fail, Travis Devine puts on a cheap suit, grabs his faux-leather briefcase, and boards the 6:20 commuter train to Manhattan, where he works as an entry-level analyst at the city\u2019s most prestigious investment firm. In the mornings, he gazes out the train window at the lavish homes of the uberwealthy, dreaming about joining their ranks. In the evenings, he listens to the fiscal news on his phone, already preparing for the next grueling day in the cutthroat realm of finance. Then one morning Devine\u2019s tedious routine is shattered by an anonymous email: She is dead. Sara Ewes, Devine\u2019s coworker and former girlfriend, has been found hanging in a storage room of his office building\u2014presumably a suicide, at least for now\u2014prompting the NYPD to come calling on him. If that wasn\u2019t enough, before the day is out, Devine receives another ominous visit, a confrontation that threatens to dredge up grim secrets from his past in the army unless he participates in a clandestine investigation into his firm. This treacherous role will take him from the impossibly glittering lives he once saw only through a train window, to the darkest corners of the country\u2019s economic halls of power . . . where something rotten lurks. And apart from this high-stakes conspiracy, there\u2019s a killer out there with their own agenda, and Devine is the bull\u2019s-eye. Read more",

Devine is a former marine who currently works at an investment house in NYC when he is tapped to do some spying by someone who knows about his past and can do irreparable damage. Thus, he is dragged into investigating crimes and murder. The pace was good, the characters were believable and the surprise twists were a welcome breath of fresh air. I enjoyed the read and look forward to the next book in the series. Now I am hooked on the character and the intrigue!DisclaimerI own a copy of this book and was not required to write a positive review. All opinions expressed are my own.",

                "reviewText": "Baldacci's \"The 6:20 Man\" was a fun read, but in my view there are a couple basic flaws in the plotline that make me reluctant to invest time and money in the sequel.o What, exactly, was she signaling by wearing a red or green bikini every few days as Our Hero watched from the 6:20 train? What critical secret message could be conveyed at a data rate of about 1 bit per day? I know this is picky, but the beautiful-girl-seen-from-the-train trope is really central to the story, and it ultimately doesn't seem to make any sense.o At the beginning of this book's sequel, we see Our Hero take out a trio of armed baddies because he intuited they were out to get him, based only their body language. How could he so blind not to recognize the psychotic villain in this story?o What happened to the Fiendish Diabolical Conspiracy Behind It All? The blurb for the sequel says Our Hero took down the \"world\u2019s largest financial conspiracy,\" but, he didn't. If the FDCBIA is coming back in a sequel, it would have been fun to end this book with, e.g., a mysterious conversation between two shadowy characters, brushing off their temporary setback. \"And this Devine guy, what of him?\" -- \"He's being dealt with.\"",

I don\u2019t think there are many books around base on this background. The book started off very well until about a third quarter of the book where it became quite slow then, the pace pick up. The ending was unexpected. As the saying goes, the person one least expected is one person who becomes your worst enemy. Overall a good book indeed.
