                "reviewText": "When I was a teenager, I managed to come across the original volume that collected these 13 Nintendo Power comics into a single volume, and I fell in love with it. Unfortunately through many moves in my adult life I lost that copy and replacing it I discovered would be grossly expensive as it was out of print. Lo, to my surprise and excitement I learned about this re-print and delightfully jumped at the opportunity to own it once more.While the cover art for the book has changed from the first printing, the comic art inside is just as crisp and colorful as I remember. The story is charming and delightfully brings to life the Super Mario World era Mario in an excellent original adventure that is full of charm, humor, and an incredible amount of fun references to the games themselves. This is most definitely the definitive Super Mario comic to experience, as the characters leap off the page and give you an amazing fun experience, and feels 100% faithful to it's source material, you never once feel as if something doesn't belong.The story itself is framed in the classical Mario plot, with the Mario Bros. going to Princess Peach's castle to do some plumbing work for a big party, only to have King Koopa, Bowser himself show up and announce his intent to Marry the Princess or he'll turn her subjects to stone. Mario and Luigi jump into action and go to try and stop Bowser, and along the way go through several fantastic and familiar locations like the Mushroom Kingdom Castle, A Haunted House, Koopaling Tower, Dark Forests, and even Koopa's Castle. Along the way meeting a slew of fun Mario characters, Yoshi, Toad, The Koopa Kids, and tons of Mario enemies like Goombas, Koopa Troops, Caterpillars, Thwomps, Reznors, Piranha Plants, Magikoopas and several more.The story plays out over 12 chapters, each one about 8 mutli-panel pages, and there's an additional Bonus chapter at the end with a new story based off Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins, showing the relationship between Mario and his evil counterpart Wario. This is a great comic that's easy to read for younger readers, and will delight Mario fans of all ages. I highly recommend it.In addition to this fantastic comic, I would also greatly recommend The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past graphic novel which also released originally in Nintendo Power and is collected in a single volume by the same publisher.",

I still can remember just about every single pane and line and they bring a great nostalgia trip. I bought these to share with my son who is just learning to read and loves Mario (and it can be hard to get him to read with me so these were perfect!). We had so much fun reading them. So much of the humor went over my head when I was a kid, but now as an adult I was laughing out loud at half the stories. And it contains a cross-dressing Luigi section that is a real gem and isn't inappropriate for kids or offensive to modern sensibilities, but is just light-hearted good fun. Kids and adults will love these high quality comics with great stories and great artwork.",
