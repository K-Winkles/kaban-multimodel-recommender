            "Editorial Reviews Review \"Whalefall is a rare thing: a page-turning, hold-your-breath, man-vs-nature thrill ride, but also a gripping exploration of the unnavigable relationship between parent and child. It's an anguished cry from the depths of that struggle. Bravo!\" -- Christopher Golden, New York Times bestselling author of Road of Bones and All Hallows\u201cA crazy, and crazily enjoyable, beat-the-clock adventure story about fathers, sons, guilt and the mysteries of the sea . . .

The struggle continues until nearly the last page, but there's a lot more involved than the physical struggle. There are several VERY cool parts that are connected to how whales communicate with one another. A fascinating book but I will not be looking to repeat this experience.

                "reviewText": "(Warning: there are some thematic* spoilers.)\u201cDying here is so much better than dying on land, where his pale, smelly corpse would be dressed and perfumed only to be mooned at by mourners out to avoid similar fates, before being plugged into overpriced soil, from which his best hope for immortality would be fossilization: a stone in a future museum, propped alongside other long-dead curiosities.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing original about a man getting eaten by a whale; we\u2019ve had this story for nearly 3,000 years. The story of Jonah and the \u201cgreat fish\u201d (people back then probably didn\u2019t know/didn\u2019t care that a whale was technically a mammal) is a fundamental account in Islam, Judaism, and\u2014by association\u2014Christianity.So Kraus didn\u2019t invent or even reinvent the wheel. But I will say that I was pleasantly surprised\u2014if not a bit underwhelmed\u2014how realistic Whalefall was. It has a \u201ctrue story\u201d kind of mundanity about it. If I told my mom this had actually happened and had her read it, she\u2019d believe it\u2014hook, line, and sinker.What is Whalefall about? Jay Gardiner goes looking for his father\u2019s remains in Monastery Beach, which is a deadly area in Cali. Now, Jay and his father didn\u2019t get along. His father was a free-spirit, hippy, let\u2019s-save-the-fish type\u2014that seemed to put that quest over his family (I\u2019ll give Kraus props for avoiding \u201cI hate my dad because he\u2019s a MAGA Republican\u201d trope). Especially his son. There\u2019s resentment. Obviously.So. Ocean. Diving. Squid. Uh oh. Whale. Oh? Ah. Pinocchio and Jonah, you get it.Daniel Kraus is known for horror. And Whalefall could have been a balls-to-the-wall survival horror extravaganza. Just remix and amplify a few elements, and there you go. But Whalefall isn\u2019t that. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a Mitch Albom novel. It pulls\u2014or tries to pull\u2014at the reader\u2019s heartstrings as we cut in and out of the whale and flashbacks between Jay and his father. The problem for me is that his father, Mitt Gardiner, didn\u2019t have enough redeeming qualities; and Jay was too whiny and threw a pity party throughout; and the conclusion of his \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d was self-deceptive and deflected any accountability for his own failures as a son.Negatives out of the way, I did enjoy a very smart philosophical concept involving a junkyard flashback, the word \u201cSheol,\u201d and the climax the novel (it takes a lot of themes from the Books of Jonah, and a little bit from the Passion story of Jesus on the cross); it\u2019s actually quite intelligent. I respect it even more because Kraus doesn\u2019t deliver it on a golden platter, nor does he brag or pat himself on the back and say, \u201clook at me.\u201d In fact, I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d done what he\u2019d done until I was on a 10 mile run two days after completing the novel.That being said, Whalefall IS NOT Christian- or Jewish-leaning; it\u2019s very New Age, very Zen, very naturalistic, very\u2026 Gen Z-ish (and Jay Gardiner definitely fits that trope, always blaming his father and never looking inward, which is why I never liked him\u2014and he never had any kind of meaningful growth).Whalefall is lukewarm. It\u2019s\u2026 fine. It could\u2019ve been a horror novel but wasn\u2019t. It could\u2019ve been a coming of age story but wasn\u2019t. It could\u2019ve been religious but wasn\u2019t. It could\u2019ve been political or preachy but wasn\u2019t. In fact, he played too safe; it\u2019s all things for all people but it doesn\u2019t have an edginess that I was craving. A few smart and sneakily inserted philosophical ideas aside, it just felt\u2026 flat. Like, well\u2026 lukewarm coffee.But it was easy to read, was smartly paced (though it did have some bloat in Act 2), and I never wanted to put it down.",

                "reviewText": "The book \"Whalefall\" is an experience that will astonish you. The beginning chapters do not inspire continued reading BUT if you keep reading you enter an exceptionally complex, yet exciting and interesting story when Jay gets swallowed by the whale. The writing is superb. The detail is amazing. The development of conversations between Jay's father, the whale, and family are wonderous. This is the best book I have read in a very long time. I picked it up solely based on a review in the New York Times. At the end, everything that occurred in the beginning chapters make total sense.I was tempted to put it down during the beginning chapters...and I think many readers who reviewed this book may have done the same. Read on, please. The experience is astonishing.",

                "reviewTitle": "Fascinating and disturbing",
                "reviewText": "Some scattered impressions of Whalefall. The science was well-researched, and what was going through the thoughts of Jay, a 17-year-old swallowed by the whale, required the author's imagination. It was a fascinating read, but I wasn't prepared for how gory and stomach-churning it was. There were several negative impressions I would have preferred omitted or toned down. I found Whalefall compelling and skipped meals and housework to read in one day, although its vivid descriptions were gag-inducing and gruesome. All the slime, debris, foul odours, and chemicals found in a whale's stomach were something I never wanted to know! I did not care for Jay and how he moved out of the home when he was fifteen, ignoring his dying father and withdrawing from his mother and sisters' presence and pleas. Flashbacks were too frequent, and I felt more forgiving toward his father than Jay did. It finally came to him that the many stories his father told him about diving and sea life might help save him, although, in the past, they never ceased to annoy and enrage him. He refused his family's plea to visit his father when the man was dying from a terminal disease, and his father killed himself by drowning. I wished I had some knowledge of diving equipment, but I understood that Jay's was cheap and needed repair due to his father saving money. Jay decides to dive to try to retrieve some of his father's bones for burial, thinking this would improve his relationship with his family. His father had been a popular diver and storyteller, and his friends resented Jay's estrangement from him.Once in the whale's belly, Jay hallucinates that the animal is speaking to him in his father's voice. Many of Jay's severe and life-threatening injuries were painfully described. Still, I wanted to learn the long-term outcome of his physical injuries, mental state, and whether he reunited with his remaining family members. The book provided excellent information on the lives, deaths, and value of sea mammals, fish and molluscs and how human practices contribute to their decline. There were lots of thought-provoking and uncomfortable arguments for change and conservation. Despite some reservations, I thought this book was compelling and a success.",

It's incredibly visceral and gross in parts - for a long time in fact. So it's not for everyone. What we have here is a really good/brilliant writer taking a risk, that leap towards greatness with legendary scale and Shakespearian themes. Stretching between the highest highs and the lowest lows of what it means to be physically alive and conscious of what that means. Did he make it? There are phrases that rang so perfectly true and magically said that they'll be dropping into my conversations for years to come. Certainly it's not as dumb as the book blurb or the book cover. Glad he took the shot at it, too bad his publisher didn't 'get it'.",
