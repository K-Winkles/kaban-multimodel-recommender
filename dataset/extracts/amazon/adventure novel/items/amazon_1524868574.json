            "Editorial Reviews From School Library Journal Gr 3\u20137\u2014In the 14th book in the series, Phoebe, a young brown-skinned girl, and her pal Marigold the unicorn continue to reflect on the world, each other, and human-unicorn differences. The comic strips here cover many topics, including dealing with bad news in the world, reconciling different tastes in music, meeting Marigold's nonbinary cousin (pronouns: neigh/neigh're), and getting along with Phoebe's popular frenemy Dakota. Marigold's subplots involve magical creatures and ancient standards, while Phoebe's often include trappings of modern culture like smartphones and video games. Phoebe's innate curiosity and affability make her a great audience proxy, while Marigold is alternately Phoebe's humorous and comforting foil. Whenever they chat, friendship blossoms and deepens. The majority of pages use 2x2 panel layouts, with occasional changes of pace such as a gallery of unicorn vistas or a dragon's comedy roast performance. A glossary provides phonetic spellings and definitions of some of the book's vocabulary. VERDICT The dry wit, observational humor, and wholesome friendship at the core of the series have not dimmed one bit. Highly recommended.\u2014Thomas Maluck About the Author Dana Claire Simpson grew up in Gig Harbor, Washington, drawing the entire time. She eventually graduated from The Evergreen State College, despite having spent all her time drawing, and not always for credit.From 1998 to 2008, she drew the internet comic strip Ozy and Millie. After winning the Amazon-sponsored Comic Strip Superstar Contest in 2009, Andrews McMeel Syndication signed her to a development deal for Heavenly Nostrils, which was later renamed Phoebe and Her Unicorn.She currently lives in Santa Barbara, California, with her tech genius spouse and her fairly stupid cat."
