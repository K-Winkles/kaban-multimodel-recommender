        "description": "Things in the Middle Florida Keys aren\u2019t as idyllic as they seem. If one looks closely, there\u2019s a layer of dirt just below the surface. The butt-ugly kind of dirt that\u2019s hard to get off.Things move slowly in the Keys\u2014locals call it island time\u2014but there are some for whom it seems that time is at a standstill; whose clocks revolve only around the tides, fish migrations, and the rising and setting of the sun and moon.Jesse McDermitt remembers the Keys the way he\u2019d first found them as a young man. He\u2019s lived on his little island in the Content Keys for a long time and he\u2019s learned to adapt to some of the change. But not all of it has been positive, and it seems the dirt has a way of finding Jesse, sticking to his feet like Everglades mud.Is it finally time to go away? To completely disappear? He has the means and there are places in the world where the dirt hasn\u2019t settled. Places he\u2019d like to show his wife and family.A group of would-be yacht thieves attack the wrong boat, unleashing a series of events that will ensure their downfall. They come when most people are sleeping\u2014under the cover of darkness. But nighttime and Jesse McDermitt are old and dear friends.Against his will, and along with his family and friends, Jesse is thrust back into the struggle between right and wrong one more time.And this time, it gets personal.",
