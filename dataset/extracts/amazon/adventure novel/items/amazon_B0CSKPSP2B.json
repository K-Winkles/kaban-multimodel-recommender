                "reviewText": "Sixteen year old Matt Darcy escaped his home with his little sister Lana when Barnaby Lincoln and his murderous outlaw family attacked and killed the rest of the Darcy family in an attempt to drive them off their homestead. Vowing vengeance, Matt settles his sister lost in an orphanage and goes to find the Lincolns. When she is adopted, he adds finding her to his \u201clist\u201d. He teams up with two other men who also have a score to settle with the Lincolns, and the three set off to find and kill them. The story has some plot twists, especially at the end but is well written, flows well and is a captivating read. This story is a slight departure from the author\u2019s usual stories, there are no religious references or romance. You may find the ending controversial, but it is historically accurate: justice was dealt out in a way that was consistent with how things were handles back then.",
