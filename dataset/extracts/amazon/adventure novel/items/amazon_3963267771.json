            "Editorial Reviews Review Foreword Reviews Magazine (scored 5 out of 5)\"A splendid homage to adventure\" \"A visual feast\" \"Large-hearted\"A spirited trio of kid sleuths undertake a classic treasure hunt in J. I. Wagner's Legend of the Star Runner. Taking its inspiration from video games and cloak-and-dagger mysteries, this story for middle-grade readers is a visual feast.Lilli's grandfather is facing eviction. With the prospect of a pirate's treasure guiding them, she and her best friends, Marvin andTimmi, set out to find the loot to rescue him from his debts. A large-hearted, na\u00efve, and wildly improbable plot delights as the fearless team - led by a treasure hunter - lands in a series of underground worlds.Several twists and turns hinge on pure luck, timing, and uncanny perceptions. A reliance on video-game staples, including hidden passageways, trapdoors, puzzles, maps, and multiple-choice paths, sometimes threatens to turn the book into a high-concept maze. Still, what the story misses in the depth of its background, the illustrations make up for; they are smart compositions using chromatic palettes and feature clues. From a cluttered kitchen to the check-in desk at the Savoy to a wall of keys at an archive, scenes set a distinct mood for the story.The tone is wisely calibrated; it's neither overly terrifying nor overly lighthearted. The perils the group encounter pose enough danger to build suspense yet leave room for escape. There's seldom doubt that the kids will prevail, considering their Holmesian knack for observation; the book's pleasure rests in their citywide ranging that peels back history to reveal the secrets of a legendary pirate embedded in their midst.A list of fun facts lists the book's film influences, which include Pirates of the Caribbean, and a section of hints offers insights written in reverse. With the exuberance of a caper, determined protagonists, and a message steeped in family legacy, this first in a planned series is a splendid homage to adventure. Reviewed by Karen Rigby May/June 2018 Disclosure: This article is not an endorsement, but a review. The author of this book provided free copies of the book to have their book reviewed by a professional reviewer. No fee was paid by the author for this review. Foreword Reviews only recommends books that we love. Foreword Magazine, Inc. is disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255. From the Author A lot of love and attention to detail went into creating Legend. Did youspot an email address in one of the illustrations? Try sending a messageand see what happens... but there is more to it than pure entertainment.A Story for the Heart - A Challenge to the MindThis is a story about friendship first and foremost. A story for the heart.And about the drive to explore, to inquire and to second-guess. All threemain characters require perseverance and courage to succeed, andderive the necessary strength from their friendship.Gets Kids' Eyes Off ScreensThis book is designed to also engage today's young video gamers andwater their taste for books. One of the main reasons for the appeal ofvideo games is a frequent feeling of accomplishment. This book isdesigned to achieve the same. The 31 concise chapters, each ending witha puzzle to be solved, provide an equally rewarding experience. Thehigh-quality visuals are another reason video gaming kids will feel rightat home.Will Girls Like the Book Too?My wife and I are proud parents of our super-cute (no bias here)daughter Emmelie. It was important to me to create a character withLilli, who is ready to take the lead and make things happen. Who doesn'tcare about what society expects but about fulfilling her own dreams andambitions.So yes, I created this story with girls in mind. Hopefully, my daughter(and you too) will love it the way I do.Have fun!

                "reviewText": "I would recommend Legend of the Star Runner to any parent with a child who thinks of books as being boring as this one provides a challenge at every step of the way. I bought this book to read on my kindle as the notion of going on a fictional treasure hunt by reading a story intriguing, and my curiosity as a writer led me to buy it. I found the story an easy read. I liked the mix of characters. Found Lilli to be easy to picture and Marvin and Timmi were a great combination. The three kids took upon themselves to help Lilli's grandfather avoid eviction by finding buried or hidden treasure - a pirate ship named The Star Runner. The elusive guardians of the mystery were just a nasty enough threat to add that touch of danger to the story. The book is a clever mix of interactive tools with a puzzle being revealed at the end of every chapter and the answer given at the start of the next chapter. I found myself scrutinising the detailed illustrations to find the answer to the puzzle. If it interests me an older child, I could see a lot of children losing themselves in this neat story.",

We loved how some puzzles were easier (to set us up for success) and some were more challenging! (He had an easier time than me solving a lot of these!). It felt very rewarding every time we solved a puzzle, and if we didn't solve something it wasn't a big deal to turn to the next chapter and excitedly find out what we missed. We even recieved a little prize at the end for solving the secret challenge and going to the 'legend of the star runner' website online! Looking forward to reading more of these in the near future!",
