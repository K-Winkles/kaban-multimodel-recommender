            "Editorial Reviews About the Author Erik Burnham is a Minnesotan writer and artist that first broke into comics by way of the Nick Landime feature from Shooting Star Comics. This led first to other anthologies and then work for IDW Publishing, including his critically acclaimed work on the Ghostbusters line of comic books and, currently, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Erik's been fortunate to work with many companies in the last few years, including Cryptozoic, Dynamite, IDW, Insight Editions, Marvel, and Panini on properties such as Godzilla, GI Joe, Ghostbusters, TMNT, Scarlet Spider, New Warriors, and Red Sonja--with more on the way (which is good news, because he loves his work.) Erik still lives in Minnesota; any rumors about this being because he's completely afraid of the forty-nine other states (and Canada) remain unverified at this time."

Unfortunately, that is the best thing about the book.This is a gag/pun a panel book. I remember the cartoon series (the original cartoon series) being funny but balanced with action. This book just does not deliver for me.The book has four stories, none of which are particularly memorable, just more gags that action. The book finishes with a varient cover gallery and sketchbook.",
