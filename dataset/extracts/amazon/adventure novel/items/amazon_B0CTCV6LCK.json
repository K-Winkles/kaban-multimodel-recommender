He\u2019s crazy and her grandfather has kept her on the ranch, so she doesn\u2019t have a learning or vision of the life outside of the ranch. Isaac is a gunfighter, but comes across as a towhead just out on his own for the first time. So for Isaac and Hazel it is \u201clove\u201d at first sight. He takes off looking for her with no idea where to go or where to look. He just rides off without as a single question. You can take it from there and figure out the problems he goes through and the crazy gun fight at the end. The author does have better books out. This book is written just a little to light hearted for a dark subject as kidnapping. It is an interesting read and some surprising character development.",
