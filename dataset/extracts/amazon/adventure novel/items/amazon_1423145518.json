The characters and scenery were depicted exactly how the source novels described them as.The dialogue, just like the pictures, was taken directly from the novels as well, often word for word.Although they obviously needed to condense things a bit, it follows the same storyline, and all of the key events are present.This is a must-have for any fans of the books. Even if you're not one for graphic novels, I guarantee this may change your perspective a bit. As for those who haven't read the novels, this is a good way to jump into the world of Percy Jackson all the same.",
