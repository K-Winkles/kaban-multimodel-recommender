                "reviewText": "Bella is an actress who, after being stranded when her company abandons her, arrives in the mining town of Silverville, CA with 2 drifters she met on the road to do shows for the miners and hopefully earn enough money to get back to San Francisco. She meets Hank Maloney a local mine owner and immediately there is an attraction. However, the unscrupulous John Krukshank has started a war with Maloney in an attempt to force him out of town so he can take over Maloney\u2019s claims. As Bella gets closer to Hank, she is drawn into the conflict and must find a way to save herself from a murderer. Fans of this author will be familiar with his style which is evident in this book. There is plenty of action, adventure, conflict, romance, and a little religion as well. Ethan Westfield is a very good storyteller; the story flows so well, and was so good, it kept my attention and I found it hard to put down; I finished it very quickly.",
