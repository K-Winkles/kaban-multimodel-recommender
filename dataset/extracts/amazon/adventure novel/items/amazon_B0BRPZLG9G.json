        "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Don\u2019t miss the hit streaming series Reacher! A string of mysterious deaths. A long-classified mission. A young MP with nothing to lose.1992. All across the United States respectable, upstanding citizens are showing up dead. These deaths could be accidents, and they don\u2019t appear to be connected\u2014until a fatal fall from a high-floor window attracts some unexpected attention. That attention comes from the secretary of defense. All of a sudden he wants an interagency task force to investigate. And he wants Jack Reacher as the army\u2019s representative. If Reacher gets a result, great. If not, he\u2019s a convenient fall guy. But office politics isn\u2019t Reacher\u2019s thing. Three questions quickly emerge: Who\u2019s with him, who\u2019s against him, and will the justice he dispenses be the official kind . . . or his own kind?",

A situation has arisen where some accomplished persons are turning up dead. Jack Reacher was called in to investigate another problem area, but then was quickly transferred to another investigation related to persons of interest turning up dead. Jack joins a small team and the search is on for clues.The clues lead to an event that occurred in India back in December 1969. There was a chemical plant in India. There was a problem. A leak killed hundreds of workers at that plant. A news release was put out indicating just a few persons had died. A coverup? Most certainly, but by whom?There was a small-group of Americans working at that plant on top-secret business. They are the ones that are dying off in the United States. For Jack Reacher it was essential that he and the small team he was with, put the puzzle together. The puzzle is complex.For those that have enjoyed the Jack Reacher novels, this one was a whole lot of fun. The novel brought us back to his military days. These were days that Jack was a physical force and as expected Jack does solve several complicated problems!Thank you, Lee and Andrew, for keeping this great series alive!",

I am a Jack Reacher fan and have read them all. The last few have definitely not been up to the level of the first books, but have been readable. This one failed to keep my interest, almost being a chore to finish. The characters are flat and the plot been-there-done-that. There is no depth to the writing. It feels like they owed the publisher one more book so threw this together.It is one murder after another in which we are to believe agents are not smart enough to protect people they know are on a hit list. The scene where the agents almost capture one of the perpetrators is ridiculous with horrible dialogue.And Jack Reacher does very little for the first half of the book. The entire book could have been cut in half for better pacing. I think I will re-read the first 20 books and skip buying the next one.",
