                "reviewText": "I appreciated how the book goes into specific details of Tifa\u2019s and Aerith\u2019s past lives before the Final Fantasy VII game. The book tells us the back stories about these two prominent women in the game, plus a bonus story about Lonny, and also tells us more about how the Final Fantasy VII story came to be. I love the in-depth stories about the characters that you only get fragmented pieces of when playing the game. It does contain some insight into life after the original and remake FFVII games, therefore might contain spoilers for some, but nothing too dramatic. The book itself was a great read, for young and adult readers alike. It was very well written and stays true to the game!",

                "reviewText": "Two fan favorite characters from Final Fantasy VII get important pieces of their stories straight in Traces of Two Pasts, a novel able to stand on its own merits while adding depth to the Remake trilogy of the popular video game series. Narratively framed as the two women telling each other about their lives before the events that brought them together (the events of FF VII Remake), we\u2019re treated first to Tifa Lockhart\u2019s explanation of how she came from a former energy boomtown that barely matches the description anymore to the massive slums of the lower city in Midgar. She moves from a child locked in by the expectations of her small town to a young woman locked into a debt owed to one of the many criminal underworld bosses in the city. This portion of the book is certainly the fullest in both its character arc and in the actual events reported.Aerith Gainsborough\u2019s half covers far fewer pages despite the potential of her story. I have the distinct impression that more is intended to be told in the second game of the remake rather than this book, but the novel does make it clear that her perspective of events was very limited and that is why there is so much less for her to explain compared to Tifa\u2019s story. We still discover some of her more interesting experiences such as her escape from the Shinra Electric Power Company building and her real mother\u2019s fate, as well as why she was allowed to live in one area of the slums without the authorities taking her back to Shinra. Most of the rest fills in how that slum operated in terms of power structure and how the slums overall relate to the Shinra company.There is a short but exceptionally well written coda to Aerith\u2019s story. It fills out a little more detail about things that happened around Aerith when she was a child but boasts its own unnamed narrator whose experiences as her childhood playmate have led him, now a young man in Shinra\u2019s employ, on an investigation into the disappearance of a friend fifteen years later.I fully recommend it for those who have no interest in the game and those that love the game.Four stars with that fifth star disappearing somewhere in Aerith's story.",

I could\u2019ve read a 500 pg book on Tifa\u2019s every day mundane life and it would be 5/5 stars lol.
