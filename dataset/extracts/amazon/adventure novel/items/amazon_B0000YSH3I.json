        "description": "In the Nevada desert, an experiment has gone horribly wrong. A cloud of nanoparticles (micro-robots) has escaped from the laboratory. This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive. It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour. Every attempt to destroy it has failed. And we are the prey. As fresh as today's headlines, Michael Crichton's most compelling novel yet tells the story of a mechanical plague and the desperate efforts of a handful of scientists to stop it. Drawing on up-to-the-minute scientific fact, Prey takes us into the emerging realms of nanotechnology and artificial distributed intelligence in a story of breathtaking suspense. Prey is a novel you can't pause. Because time is running out. Read more",

                "reviewText": "This was a fantastic book about nanotechnology. Hard to believe it was published in 2009, it is very much relevant today. It starts out as a family book, a stay at home father, Jack, with a hard working wife and three kids including a baby. Dad is quite capable and is better at taking care of the kids than mom is, and she is upset about it. Her high stress job keeps her busy. Jack was forced into unemployment and has been searching for work. He is offered a consulting job at his wife's company. He learns the horrifying details of what they were working on and it has gotten out of hand. I really liked how the story flowed, you were introduced to the family first, then to the disaster. Very thrilling and horrifying in the complications. For the audiobook, the author reads the introduction, his voice weak. The narrator was excellent. It needed an epilogue that we didn't get. Fantastic book, very enjoyable.",

                "reviewText": "PREY definitely has a lot of Crichton-esque qualities - well-researched science (nanotech and genetic algorithm), an imaginative tale of man's invention gone awry, gruesome twists, and a thrilling ending - but I found that it lacks the \"it\" factor of his other groundbreaking works like Jurassic Park.Maybe that is an unfair bar to measure it against, but PREY just felt more cliche overall. I felt less attached to the characters, who were quite 2-dimensional and archetypical (the kids are bratty and call each other names like they're on an episode of the Simpsons, the wife is distant, the husband is over-taxed), and the \"monster\", the clouds of nanobots, convey more so the annoyance of a swarm of bees than the menace of a stomping T-Rex.Overall, I still enjoyed it. I would give a 3.5 if I could. If you're looking for a quick sci-fi thriller, I'd say go for it.",

                "reviewText": "Mr. Crichton has developed a habit of taking current technologic challenges and submitting them to flights of fancy. Such is the case with his latest novel. Here is the thesis: increasingly complex systems become increasingly uncontrolable, and at some point may develop behaviors beyond those intended or anticipated by the designers. In a sense these behaviors may mimic evolution, at some point the creatures imitating if not in fact becoming sentient creatures. Of course these creatures would not be worth a novel if they didn't do Really Bad Things, and couldn't be contained or controlled in a conventional way. The creatures in this case are microscopic machines manufactured (bred?) to act as collectively as a camera, that take on the characterists of a predatory algorithm conveniently built into its programming by its designers. They attack things, multiply, threaten to take over the earth; well, you get the idea. The subplot concerns the marital relationship between an unemployed programmer who just happened to design the algorithm, and his wife, who just happens to be an executive in the company who inadvisedly included his algorithm into the microbots. Did she cheat on him or not? Does the world end? What unswered questions will we have at the last page? Sticky sweet melodrama to be sure, but worth an afternoon to read.The thought came to me as I read another of Mr. Crichton's books (Airframe) that he had written it with the movie rights in mind. No deep character development, thank you, and evenly paced, if not contrived, action. The same happened as I read this book. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing. If you want a little more meat with your starch, maybe try Stephen King. A lot more energy could have been given to what the principals felt and though along the whole way. Narrated by a man who on the one hand is troubled by his wife's (possibly unfaithful) behavior, and on the other by the technology he spawned that threatens mankind, I would have liked a better image of what made him tick, and a little less stereotype. Being part geek by nature I didn't mind all the techno stuff, but it may be off-putting to some. These reservations aside, Prey is worth the time to read it, or as in this case, to hear while on the way to work. Keep your literary expecations in check, though, and try not to lose any sleep over the thought that there may be nanobots in your soup.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot possibly do this book justice. I just have to say it is one of my favourite books of all time. And it's not because it's better than Harry Potter or wisked me away to a far away land. It's because I couldn't put the book down. It was a thriller that surprised me how much I enjoyed it. My favourite Micheal Crichton book. It's about a man who basically misses his wife who's a big shot at a tech company that does secret things and when he hasn't heard from her in a while he goes out to the company building to find her only to discover that the tech she has been working on has gotten loose. Won't say anymore but so worth a read.",
