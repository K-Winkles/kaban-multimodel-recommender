Bickers' fiction tends to reflect the values and prejudices of its time but the book is nicely paced and the flying sequences well described - as you'd expect from an author who's ex-RAF.The ending felt a little ambiguous but overall an entertaining read.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed the more emotional side to this, which can sometimes be missing or skimmed over in books about warfare. The pain that Templar feels at the loss of his wife, and the turmoil of his son, is palpable and heartrending, offset by the good old fashioned action scenes in a way that leant the work substance and balance. Would definitely recommend: more than just a book about war!",
