                "reviewText": "As I had hoped my child really liked these books. The novelty of making choices encouraged longer reading despite there being very few pictures. The multiple choices gives the illusion of being a much longer book than a read through really takes. My child wasn't interested in going back and trying different choices to find the alternate endings but did immediately pick up a much longer chapter book than ever attempted before. A great option to encourage more reading.",

Valuto 4 stelle solo perch\u00e8 la scatola contenitore \u00e8 arrivata danneggiata, con uno strappo sul fondo e quindi ho dovuto riparare con del nastro adesivo per far tenere la forma. Danno che non vale il reso, anzi, sono in mostra ugualmente e non viene influenzata l'esperienza di lettura, essendo il contenitore \"un extra\" dal mio punto di vista.Bellissimi e consigliatissimi, sono in inglese ovviamente!",
