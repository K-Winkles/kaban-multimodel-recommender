                "reviewText": "I always enjoy a good Jesse McDermitt story. This one involved Jesse, and Savannah, and Charity plus some of the Armstrong crew and a couple of interesting bad guys. Jesse is like a lot of us. Getting old and slowing down. Finn got to be a hero in this story also but it cost him. I liked the scene in gaspar's revenge after Jesse and Charity had rescued the two girls and the two adults from the human traffickers. Where one of the girls said to Jesse not a spy huh after watching encrypted communications that were far beyond what you would normally find on a civilian boat. Didn't like the ending so much but it does leave open the possibility of at least one good story maybe a couple as Jesse chases down Savannah.",

I'm an 81 yr old female so I definitely lean towards Savannah's side of things. Please hurry and get the next book done so we can get Jesse back with his wife and son and of course dog.",

                "reviewText": "Jesse McDermitt is admirable, courageous, and inspirational, he is compassionate, intelligent, and completely patriotic. He is excellent at anything & everything he does, and is always trying to be better. Jesse is a TRUE, RED, WHITE, & BLUE, AMERICAN HERO!Unfortunately, the love of his life, savannah is not. SPOILER ALERT!!!The idea that an covert operator or their superior would allow the untrained and interfering spouse to constantly interrupt, issue demands and ultimatums during the planning and execution of an extremely critical assignment is ludicrous. As well as dangerous, especially when the intrusion and disruption is during the middle of a covert mission.Personally, I am so disgusted with the egotistical, controlling, narcissistic, selfish behavior of savannah that I almost refused to buy or read this book! As it was, I stopped reading more than a few times.When is Jesse going to find his cojones and cease giving in to this self centered, spoiled woman? Remember, savanna has NEVER really had a job, never had to achieve anything, and thinks she is smarter and better than everyone else.One of his friends or family members must tell him! Remember, savannah lied to Jesse from the very beginning. She knew for years that Jesse was Flo's Father, and never told either one of them. She didn't allow Flo the opportunity of knowing her Daddy, even though it is a critical part of growing into a well adjusted and happy adult. savannah didn't allow Jesse to be a parent or participate in even a small part of Flo's life while she was growing up!However, as soon as Flo grows up, savanna marries Jesse, and then when Flo leaves for college, and the \"empty nest syndrome\" hits, luckily Jesse rescues a little orphan boy,and bingo! Adoption!Now after once again interfering into something she has no way or reference to understand, she demands Jesse save a mass murderer.When he can't without getting more people killed, including himself, and prior to hearing the entire timeline or details of what occured, savannah takes their adopted son and leaves, running and hiding from Jesse once again. she knows how and also that he will never be able to find his son! (payback for not doing EXACTLY what she demanded he do!)Once again savannah has completely shattered Jesse's heart and soul. the endI sincerely hope there is another book and in that upcoming book Jesse gets wise to the REAL savannah and moves on. Really moves on. He must exorcise her from his body, mind, soul, and heart. savannah has required complete honestly about Jesse's entire life and demanded intimate and complete details of every single event, dream or thought he has had during his life. savannah has NEVER been completely honest and truthful about everything in her life. She has prevaricated, omitted events, and lied by ommission. Nevertheless, savannah is once again demanding outcomes that are totally unachievable as well as being horrifically dangerous for Jesse, and his partner on this mission as well as extraordinarily hazardous for many others throughout the entire worldWayne, please bring back the REAL JESSE MCDERMITT! AMERICA (as well as your readers) and the entire world still need Jesse. THE REAL JESSE MCDERMITT!",
