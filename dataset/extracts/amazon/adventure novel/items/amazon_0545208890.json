                "reviewText": "Emily must continue her journey to master her power as a Stone Keeper and save Alledia from the Elf King. But her challenge grown as she now faces a new enemy in Max, the mysterious young Stone Keeper who has aligned himself with the Elf King. And they have the last of the mother stone and together they are creating new allies to destroy all who are in their path. But secrets are revealed...not only about the Elf King, but about the stone itself. And perhaps once more there is hope at defeating the Elf King and restoring balance. But for now Emily and her friends must prepare for battle and hope that they survive.I've loved the entire series but the story in this one blew me away. Kazu finally answers some of the mysteries that he's been building, such as the voice of the stone and what it really is. But even better than that Kazu continues to build and enrich what we know about the characters lives creating an even more engaging story to pull the reader in. In this book we learn more about Max, the mysterious Stone Keeper from the last volume, and even more about Trellis and the journey that he's on. My one and only regret with this book is that it ended all too quickly.The artwork in this volume is absolutely phenomenal. Kazu and his team have outdone themselves with this series and in this volume they surpass themselves. Mind you I'm viewing an electronic galley so the final actual print could be even better, but the colors are astounding. They make the book come alive, such as the baren snowy landscape scenes. You would think that these types of scenes would be easy to create, brown/black for the mountain and white for the snow and boom, you're done. But to create truly impressive scenes, such as the ones in this book, you have to build layer upon layer of color, some of which you won't ever really see, but they help create a complete image. And the scenes of Cielis, the floating city, are phenomenal. I could almost believe that I was looking at a photograph instead of an illustration. I can't wait to see what they do in the next book.This has been one of my favorite series since the first book came out and I eagerly look forward to each new volume. It's an epic journey on par with Jeff Smith's Bone, with captivating characters and fantastic artwork. I can't wait to see where Kazu takes us next in this journey and I eagerly await the next volume in this fantastic series. 5 out of 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "First: Dad dies in first Amulet book. I thought that was a little intense, but okay. Talked to kids about how scary that would be, how that will not likely happen to me, etc.My son started reading these when he was seven and really looks forward to each and every one and we pre-order all them for when they are released. He is nine now and our seven year old daughter has now also read all of them. The books are worn. The kids really like them a lot. So A+ for kids loving the book.My response: Well, there aren't a lot of words. Lots of pictures, minimal reading. I'm not complaining that kids are reading, but I do encourage them to read books with multiple sentences in a row. I would give five stars for how much kids like them, but four stars because they are (it seems like to me) primarily picture books with some words. Good pictures, yes. But primarily pictures.Overall, kids love them and story seems compelling and reasonably appropriate for ages 7/9, as long as there is accompanying conversation with parents.",

                "reviewText": "This set of books starts off with a bold tragedy that sets up the rest of the characters. Fun and fantastic, Tolkien like with a mash up of Jim Henson muppets. The story is captivating and possibly more important, is the art. Attention to detail, vibrante colours and imaginative creations. You root for the lead charcters, Emily and Navin. Being so young but brave to go after their mother who has been taken by a octopus slash bug monster. The new world they discover will shock and awe them. To find out this place is hidden from the eyes of \"our\" world and that destruction can come to both. It is reveled to the kids by their great grandpa Silas, who sets them on this important mission. Character delvopment is huge in this book series and the friends that go with Emily and Navin. You get to meet Miskit the rabbit, Cogsley the jerk robot and Leon the fox, bounty hunter.All important for Emily and Navin to complete their quest. I hope that book five is not the last of this book collection.",

He LOVED it. He devoured it in one sitting and even had an emotional moment and needed a hug after Volume 1. So engaging! So happy he's broadened his horizons, too.",
