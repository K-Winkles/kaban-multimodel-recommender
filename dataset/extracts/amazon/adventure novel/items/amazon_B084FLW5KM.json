        "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 Don\u2019t miss the hit streaming series Reacher! Jack Reacher is back! The \u201cutterly addictive\u201d (The New York Times) series continues as acclaimed author Lee Child teams up with his brother, Andrew Child, fellow thriller writer extraordinaire.\u201cOne of the many great things about Jack Reacher is that he\u2019s larger than life while remaining relatable and believable. The Sentinel shows that two Childs are even better than one.\u201d\u2014James PattersonAs always, Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. One morning he ends up in a town near Pleasantville, Tennessee.But there\u2019s nothing pleasant about the place.In broad daylight Reacher spots a hapless soul walking into an ambush. \u201cIt was four against one\u201d . . . so Reacher intervenes, with his own trademark brand of conflict resolution.The man he saves is Rusty Rutherford, an unassuming IT manager, recently fired after a cyberattack locked up the town\u2019s data, records, information . . . and secrets. Rutherford wants to stay put, look innocent, and clear his name.Reacher is intrigued. There\u2019s more to the story. The bad guys who jumped Rutherford are part of something serious and deadly, involving a conspiracy, a cover-up, and murder\u2014all centered on a mousy little guy in a coffee-stained shirt who has no idea what he\u2019s up against.Rule one: if you don\u2019t know the trouble you\u2019re in, keep Reacher by your side.",

                "reviewText": "I found this slow going. Perhaps I'm tiring of the Jack Reacher formula. Not so much the showing up in town and immediately getting involved in action and drama, or the traveling-light, just-a-toothbrush in his pocket part.More the emotional flatness. It's part of his personality and for a long time I saw it as part of his charm. He avoids emotional reaction to anything, instead instantly starting to reduce it to angles and motives and what's the play. But the endless plays get tedious. It took me a month or more to get through this, which doesn't speak well for it as a pageturner.When I got to the end of those written solely by Lee Child, the first 24, I took a break, because I was already having to push myself through them. So it's not about Andrew Child's collaboration. The writing is similar. Reacher still sounds like Reacher.After a brief sojourn in Nashville where he helps a rock band get paid by a dishonest club owner, he finds himself in a small town a couple of hours away protecting a guy just became a town pariah.Rusty Rutherford, the city's IT supervisor, is being blamed for a ransomware attack freezing all the computers, systems and cellphones in town. He's been fired, no one will speak to him and now bad guys are gunning for him.Reacher jumps in on his behalf, of course, and starts to dig. What they find has repercussions far beyond black-hat hackers holding the town's systems hostage. Rutherford was working on a piece of security software that might prove valuable on the private market. But there are many layers to peel back.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Wish Lee understood sentence structure",
                "reviewText": "Lee Child can weave an interesting tale about Jack Reacher but may drive readers who are familiar with proper sentence structure and use of punctuation to the brink. I know that\u2019s the case for me. I purchased the entire Jack Reacher series of books after seeing the first season of the series. I never would have read so many of his books if I hadn\u2019t already paid for them. I have often wondered why, with all the money that Lee Child must have brought in from his writing, he can\u2019t seem to afford a staff who will proofread and correct the many mistakes throughout his books. Same goes for his publisher. I held onto hope with each successive book that he might learn something about writing and make his books easier to read. I hoped, with the addition of his brother on the last couple, that the books would improve but seemed to get only worse. Sometimes, 2 whole pages of back-and-forth banter are written with nothing to occasionally let you know who is speaking, so multiple readings may be needed at times to sort it out. I think almost all, if not all, of the pages have sentences with commas where none are needed, periods where commas are needed, clauses used as sentences, and a new paragraph starting from a clause that belongs in the previous sentence of the preceding paragraph. As I said, hard to read if you understand basic sentence structure. There are often times where I wish Lee had done one iota of research to get facts right. I refer to passages in the stories where it was apparent that Lee Child had no experience or knowledge; I guess, more or less, the writing is off the top of his head. Some problems are: 1: He thinks the flashing emergency lights of vehicles in the western states are the same as in much of the New England states (blue on fire trucks and red on police). 2: He didn\u2019t know what the average shoe size in America is actually 10 \u00bd (stating it as 9) 3: He thinks a large man like Jack Reacher would have what Lee evidently thinks of as a large foot size of 11, instead of something closer to 14 or 15 (I am 6\u20191\u201d and wear a 13.) I assume Lee has a small foot. 4: Lee has never been near a fast-moving train, thinking there is violent ground movement when the train is even over a mile away and hurricane force winds near one traveling 60 mph. 5: He seems to think that all gas stations and quick marts sell khaki pants and various shirts, packs of socks, and underwear. 6: Jack Reacher can knock anyone unconscious and very often dead with one punch. I can remember only a couple times when it took two. 7: He thinks face bones will \u201cshatter\u201d from a Jack Reacher punch and can knock out a gorilla or even an elephant. Jack also never has injuries to his hand or elbow from such amazing blows. 8: Jack Reacher\u2019s hands are said to be as large as a dinner plate and his fists as large as Thanksgiving turkeys\u2026really? Yes, his books are hard to read for these and other reasons caused by lack of oversight by his publisher and lack of staff. Please, I hope never to find out he has a staff that lets this stuff through. Good storyteller, other than the lack of research on details and no idea as to sentence/paragraph structure.. Rating would be five for the story.Won't buy future books",

Reacher really doesn\u2019t age and seems to be housebroken too. Plus like the A Team he always has a plan. This story had an edge to it which kept me wondering whether all the bad guys were really who they professed to be. It was endearing to learn too that Reacher doesn\u2019t like being in tight dark spaces underground. I shall await his next adventure.",
