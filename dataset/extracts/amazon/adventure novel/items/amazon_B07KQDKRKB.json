Especially at the better than fair price tag that Amazon was able to provide for this particular version/copy. And yet again as usual with Amazon- the delivery speed/time post placing my order for 4 out of 5 purchased items was unrivaled and phenomenal ! I might not be a personal fan of the \"alleged\" mass genociding UN Factioning Globalist swine (who rides giant co@k shaped \ud83d\ude80 rockets in space) whom founded & owns your more than massive book and music store killing behemoth corporation/company - but as a gallant Son & Noble loyal to the more mighty than both the Elites & their pompously presumed \"cattle class\" Odin, I am always compelled and required to bestow credit where & when it is due.

I truly couldn't wait to read the next page all the way through to see what happened next.BUT, if you think 'The Last President' is a parallel or mirroring Donald Trump's Presidency, you are mistaken. I would opine that you seriously need to educate yourself on the fact that Donald Trump was asked by Military Intelligence (Patriots in the NSA ie: Admiral Rogers) to run for President. You need to educate yourself what the central bank, the Rothschilds, the deep state are trying to do to force us into submission and end America as we know it (including our amazing Constitution). You need to educate yourself about the Patriots in the military who are running the greatest intelligence operation ever known in order to save this amazing Republic. A military that began this current massive operation to save the USA shortly after the deep state assassinated JFK. (Yes, Q is real). Bottom line is, 'The Last President' is a great short story and I'm so glad I read it. But this is NOT about President Trump as some sort of time traveler who is now fulfilling Ingersoll Lockwood's story.",

Not read much of the rest of the book but reads like a fanciful prequel to Micheal Rockefeller\u2019s adventures in New Guinea. The classic Victorian language and spirit of adventure is appreciated. It\u2019s clear that President Trump named his son Barron to leverage the virtues of our fearless, young protagonist.",

                "reviewText": "The first two books are amusing for the most part and tell some interesting tales. The stories almost all follow the same pattern. The little baron finds a clue in a manuscript to a forgotten or unexplored land, the journey there, meeting the peoples of the land with their odd quirks, meeting the king/queen and usually princess, cleverly solving some puzzling problem or situation, and finally returning home. The baron is an appealing character and his dog is always there to help in an endearing way.The third book is only the last twenty pages of the collection and has absolutely nothing in common with the first two books. It's interesting on it's own but I find it an odd inclusion in this trilogy. I kept waiting for the appearance of the baron but avail.As others have mentioned, the book also has many printing errors. While this doesn't detract too much, you have to think about the context sometimes to decipher what should be there. Seems like they just scanned it from an original printing and didn't even read the result.",

Whether Baron actually had these adventures, or they were a figment of a child's imagination, they were still a LOT of fun. The 3rd books is a bit hard to follow, and doesn't really tie in with the other 2 (and is only like 20 pages long), but I would still recommend reading this series.",
