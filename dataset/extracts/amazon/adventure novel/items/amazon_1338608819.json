                "reviewText": "After binge watching all the current seasons of The Dragon Prince, I was hoping for more and this was a great addition to it. It gives context between season 3 and 4, and I love the extra context it gives about certain characters. They bring a lot more depth into side characters and the main characters in this graphic novel. You go into season 4 kind of wondering what happened because there is a time skip, though I won\u2019t spoil more in this review.I don\u2019t expect this novel to be very complex like other reviews have stated, it is a show tailored to kids after all although it is still complex in its own way in my opinion. I love watching shows like The Dragon Prince, and movies similar such as How to Train Your Dragon and it is not as child-like as you\u2019d expect it to be. It has a lot of those themes that kids would miss but adults would understand.",

The interactions between the characters (IE, the writing) felt natural enough, and it was nice to visit these characters again in the new story. However, I wasn't a fan of the scrappy artwork - of the two comics, 'Bloodmoon Huntress' is illustrated with a better hand (in my opinion) and the writing is a bit stronger.By all means, if you're a collector of things, purchase this comic and enjoy the story. But if you needed to choose between the two, I would pick 'Bloodmoon Huntress.'",

Overall, it's a fun way to spend the 10 minutes needed to read it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. La serie su Netflix mi era piaciuta molto, appena ho visto questo fumetto non ho potuto non prenderlo.La trama narra gli avvenimenti accaduti subito la stagione 3 della serie. I dialoghi in inglese sono abbastanza semplici e in generale la lettura \u00e8 scorrevole e adatta anche ai pi\u00f9 piccoli. Il ritmo alterna gag comiche a momenti pi\u00f9 riflessivi. Spiccano invece i colori, e i disegni, come nel resto della serie d'altronde. Le tavole hanno anche una bella variet\u00e0 di composizione. La trama da per scontato che si sia vista la serie e in generale non si evolve poi tanto, la storia narrata nel fumetto \u00e8 abbastanza corta, per\u00f2 colma quel buco che era rimasto tra la terza e la quarta stagione, pertanto consiglio questa lettura principalmente ai fan della serie.",
