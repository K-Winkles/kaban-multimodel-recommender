                "reviewText": "A short but entertaining narrative of the Desert Air Force from its beginnings in Egypt up to its end in Italy in 1945. This comprises a happy mix of narrative history mixed with eyewitness accounts and amusing anecdotes to illustrate battlefield experiences and everyday life in the Desert Air Force. The author has a very readable style that is very reminiscent of immediate post war memories and histories. This conveys a strong impression that he was a contemporary of the events he is describing and may well explain the decidedly non PC anecdotes and comments that appear from time to time.I found this a good introduction to the subject, I finished it feeling that I had a good basic understanding of both the major events and the kind of life experienced by members of the DAF at this time. Readers wishing for a more detailed focus and critical analysis may want to look at the works by Brian Cull and Christopher Shores, but for an good informative and entertaining overview you could do much worse than this.",
