Writer Daniel Jose Older \u2013 whose \u201cStar Wars\u201d output I tend to be pretty cold on \u2013 does good work here in keeping the momentum of the plot moving, continually finding new ways to either keep the narrative unpredictable or \u2013 at the very least \u2013 emphasizing interesting character dynamics and beats in just the right way, at just the right time. For fans of \u201cThe High Republic\u201d Volume 2 of \u201cThe High Republic Adventures\u201d represents a sturdy, well-crafted adventure \u2013 one that\u2019s just as satisfying for older readers as younger ones.",
