Shorty doing his normal investigative work in England instead of the US, but the excitement never wanes from beginning to end! Too, Mr. Paul Thompson's mastery of character selections are unsurpassed in this ongoing series of entertainment, will definitely keep you turning pages to see what's around the corner next!Definitely recommend this compassionately loaded series of unending western extravaganzas to all readers, as I assure you nonwestern purveyors will also enjoy following these compassionately motivated individuals in their pursuit of the wrongful minded individuals they are chasing! You nonwestern purveyors will, most definitely enjoy following Shorty in his overseas pursuit!!!\ud83d\ude03",
