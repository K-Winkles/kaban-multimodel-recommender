And then embellishing the storyline with wit and humor playfully woven in - it was a joy to read as an adult and imagine any young reader could fully relate to the characters and emersed into the story and subtle messages. It was brilliantly done! Brava!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this book Cosmic Adventures of Astrid & Stella and the sequel part 2 (on preorder) for the library at our youth dojo, and the kids love it! The illustrations are gorgeous and the full color saturation and all the scenery details really take kids' imagination away to another planet as they go on the adventures with the characters. As a teacher, I appreciate the hidden life lessons, \"We can do hard things!\" and everyone needs a break now and then, as the characters set goals, do tasks to prepare, undertake the project even when it gets hard, give themselves a break to refresh through self-care, and ultimately accomplish their goal, with a reward. The writing is fun and upbeat and full of silly & smart puns, and with the beautiful landscapes reading this book was like being in a technicolor dreamscape of unicorns and ice cream in outer space, but with substance. All the products from HelloLucky! are just darling and so thoughtful and high quality, I also got the advent calendar 'Tis the season for Elf-Care, and regularly love their stationary full of puns and bright colors and amazing lettering. Plus you're supporting a pair of sisters' small business, win-win!",

                "reviewText": "The book itself is eye catching. It\u2019s very colorful and fun to look at. The illustrations or graphic art is very cute. The characters are cute enough. It\u2019s like very kitschy and\u2026. well, cute.The problems that I have with this graphic novel almost warrant returning it. I feel bad because I\u2019m sure a lot of hard work goes into making a book. I actually really would like to return it and I might. Maybe I\u2019ll donate it to a library but here\u2019s why I struggled with it:So the biggest problem that I had was that the storylines are SO. CHAOTIC. There is no moral. There is no real story even. There are three chapters and they are just full of fluff with little attempts and puns and quips but it just falls so flat in the actual dialogue and story of the book. It\u2019s like there\u2019s just nothing to this book like I feel like I didn\u2019t even read anything.The only place I could ever feel like this book would do well is maybe in a library. Or maybe if a child is just gaining confidence in reading. I have felt more satisfied after reading a little newspaper comic than I did after reading this. But I just feel like it was so boring and pointless. I felt really disappointed because again so cute and colorful it could have been great! If you\u2019re familiar with Mo Willems- like elephant and piggie- that was the kind of dry humor I was going into this hoping for. But it just went nowhere. I know it sounds harsh but they could\u2019ve come up with so many better ideas for actual stories. It was just random puns and a strange colorful abyss of nothingness. Bloop blooper what the heck is that it\u2019s just nonsense and not the fun kind.I bought it for a 7 year old niece for Christmas. Part of me wants to see what she thinks of it. Part of me feels like her brain will feel mushy after reading this disorganized, random, acid trip of a book.I genuinely think the positive reviews for this book know the creators personally because I can\u2019t understand their endearments otherwise.",
