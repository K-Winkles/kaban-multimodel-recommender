What is threatened is the indigenous tribes in the jungle, the jungle itself, and the wildlife that live there. The drug cartels are capturing and selling wildlife, clearing the jungle and selling off trees that are in demand for their hardwood, and planting cocoa to produce huge quantities of cocaine. Environmentalists become targets to eliminate and anyone who stands in their way. Jesse McDermitt decides to get involved to stop it and gets the green light from Jack Armstrong. Quite the story, one wishes all drug cartels were dealt with this way!",

                "reviewText": "I've read many of the Jesse McDermitt novels and have enjoyed them immensely. The only thing that bothers me is his misuse of the term\"hatch\" when referring to a door. As a maritime professional we use the term hatch when referring to an opening in the deck,where personnel or other items pass thru vertically. Even a watertight door is still referred to as a door on a yacht or ship.",

He made his way to the Florida Keys and began living as a civilian. Over the course of twenty plus books, he married, lost his wife, gained friends, reunited with his daughters, worked for Homeland Security, killed a few bad guys, saved a bunch of people, married again and, most recently , moved.out of his island life and into a 199 foot yacht cum research vessel.There's an ongoing cast of characters - the result of Stinnett's skill at world building. I don't think you need to know all the backstory from all the previous books, but I am happy to say I've followed all of them and this one is whole and complete and also sets the stage for the next book to.come. I look forward to it!",
