It's a fun change of pace for Batman fans of all ages, but the real draw is the artist. Starbite is INCREDIBLE, and the expressions and body language of the characters is what really sells the story. Come for the story, stay for the incredible artwork!(Side note, the cover isn't drawn by Starbite, which is super weird. The actual comic book art in the book is MUCH better than the cover art.)",

Wenn man eine Pause von der d\u00fcsteren Hauptstory von Batman und einfach eine s\u00fc\u00dfe Familiengeschichte haben m\u00f6chte mit vielen Sticheleien und Streichen zwischen Geschwistern, dann ist das hier die beste Option.Des Weiteren ist der Zeichenstil einfach ph\u00e4nomenal und niedlich. Echt top! Freue mich schon auf den n\u00e4chsten Teil.Lieferung war auch super schnell und sogar einen Tag fr\u00fcher als angegeben. Eine super \u00dcberraschung.",
