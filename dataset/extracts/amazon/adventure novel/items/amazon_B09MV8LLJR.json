        "description": "Discovering a severed foot sets Detective David Wolf on a deadly collision course.When a drug runner on pre-trial release disappears before his court date, nobody in the Sluice-Byron County Sheriff's Department is surprised. What is shocking, though, is Detective David Wolf finding the mule\u2019s foot, tracking ankle bracelet still attached. It looks like somebody has come to retrieve their man, and to make a statement in the process.Why the bloody theatrics? Wolf wonders, realizing he may never know. Answers involving men like these are often hard to come by. But he soon realizes a psychologist in town, a friend he\u2019s grown close with over the years, has also gone missing, and the two disappearances are linked. And with the news, the doctor's family is now desperate, and Wolf will need to find those answers fast. With the aid of his FBI friend Special Agent Kristen Luke, Wolf embarks on his frantic search, and soon finds that in order to rescue his friend he\u2019ll have to deal with a dangerous, deadly foe. One that has nothing left to lose, and no regard for the lives he takes. In the brand new, action and suspense-filled 16th installment of the International Bestselling David Wolf Series, can Wolf and Luke traverse the depths of evil and come out unscathed this time? Or will death finally catch up to them?",
