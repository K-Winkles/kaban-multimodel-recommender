                "reviewText": "Three and a half starsI was a little disappointed with the ending of this book. Just like some of her other newer books in the series, the story abruptly ends just as the disaster begins, except for a chapter that has a time jump and tells us the conclusion of the story.I was really interested in the beginning, a small family lives in the Alaskan Bush in 1964, and their cabin is attacked by a grizzly bear, forcing them to move to town for several months. Eleven-year-old Jack, who could survive on his own in the Bush, now had to go to school for the first time. This was surprisingly hard for him, and he thought it would be better to just be alone. But then the most powerful earthquake in American history struck, and he realizes that maybe having friends isn\u2019t so bad.Included at the end of the book, is a long section of the author\u2019s visit to the area and facts and photos of the real-life event.Overall, I really enjoyed the story, but I just wish the section after the earthquake was longer. To me, the most exciting books in series are the ones where the disaster happens closer to the beginning/middle of the story, and the character has to survive the disaster for the remainder of the book.",
