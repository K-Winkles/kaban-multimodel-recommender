Thus I decided to try out his Sci-Fi volumes. I purchased the first three available volumes; which I enjoyed so much that I immediately purchased the fourth in the series that is, \"On Point\", when it became available, also enjoyable.Furthermore, I have checked Amazon to Pre-order the latest Volume of the :\"Clay Warrior Stories\", that is \"Reluctant Siege\", but this not yet available for pre-order.I hope this time Amazon does not release first on Kindle before releasing it on Hardcover/Paperback. I am one of those that is not a fanof e-books. I want something I can hold and flip the pages.",

I won't go into great detail - there's really no point since the author has already completed the four book story arc and so my comments will have no impact on the quality of the rest of the series.I will say, though, that I finished the book and purchased the next in the series (On Duty) because I saw some promise and wanted to see where things went. Where they went is much of the same, except even more shoddy work. I had to put it down in frustration and walk away. Normally, follow up books are better, at least from the mechanics of the writing, but that wasn't the case here.I can't recommend either this book, On Station, or the follow up book, On Duty, which I give two stars since it seems the author didn't get any better with practice.",

Clifton Slater\u2019s Galactic Council Realm series must be the first book in the genre that I\u2019ve read for about 20 years. As I got into the book I realised what I had been missing. \u2018On Station is a top-class space adventure, which gripped me from page one to the last and I didn\u2019t want to put the book down.J. Clifton Slater has created a detailed and fascinating universe in which the Galactic Council Realm resides. The characters are interesting, especially the hero Sergeant Phelan Oscar Piran, formerly of the Galactic Council Marine Corps. The book was so good that I will certainly be getting the next two in the series and look forward to continuing to follow Phelan\u2019s adventures. Great Sci-Fi and well deserving the five stars I am going to give this review.",

The characters were intriguing, the story well thought out, and filled with enough original ideas to grip a reader who isn't usually drawn into military SciFi.It'll be fascinating to see where the author takes us in the sequel.",
