I was surprised at how it made me laugh out loud, the book is a very creative approach to mixing kid humor and Bible facts into a silly story. Also the comic expression in the artwork is great even with line drawings. Having homeschooled three boys and now volunteering with a kids club, I believe this book will appeal to elementary aged kids and make them laugh even more than I did. Any kid will enjoy, and kids with a little bit of Bible knowledge with find it even more hilarious.",

It is such a relief to find zany, funny and clever children\u2019s books that show the everyday point of view from a 10 year old\u2019s diary but is not rude nor teaches bad manners. It\u2019s so much fun to see Patrick\u2019s point view of bible stories and to see his life interwoven Diary of a Wimpy kid style. It is definitely a bird\u2019s eye view of the Bible stories meant to wet one\u2019s appetite to read the story in the Bible. Bible references are always given at the end of each story, so kids can look it up. Note: You cannot see the \u201cLook inside\u201d preview if you are on your phone, so I\u2019ll add a few pictures.",

                "reviewText": "There is King James, the Revised Standard Version, the New American Standard (and more) versions of the Bible - but my current favorite is Patrick Wigglesworth\u2019s account in \u201cBizarre BIBLE Adventure (Over My Head)\u201d. The illustrations and spot-on Biblical text are a delight to read (and reread) for old and young alike. Creators Liz and Jack Hagler are to be commended for their clever and thoughtful interpretation of the age-old stories from Genesis to Deuteronomy. I recommend this for entire families to share, learn and laugh together. Linda Hancock",
