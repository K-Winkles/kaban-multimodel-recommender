        "description": "A brand new Western adventure from Paul L. Thompson!Shorty stood looking across the landscape of that burning desert of cactus and runty scrub brush and saw heat waves shimmering along the foothills of the far away mountains. It had to be over a quarter mile. The water in his canteen was hot, almost too hot to drink. He took a swig then poured a few cups in his hat and gave it to Dunnie. As he hung that canteen back over the saddle horn, he shook the last two full ones he had. Only one full day and two-thirds of the second day had passed, and he\u2019d already used two canteens of water and over half of another.\u201cLord, if it be thy will, don\u2019t let time run out before I find her. Dying of thirst is no way to die.\u201d He placed his hand on a canteen. \u201cYeah, find her an\u2019 maybe find a good dab of nice cool water.\u201d Read more",
