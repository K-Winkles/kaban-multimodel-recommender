                "reviewText": "Wow, these guys are amazing with their creative think out of the box minds. What. Heck of a rollicking fast paced and fascinating story! The story begins in 1976 with Woody Rains flying an anthem Vega plane in a tropical storm with no visibility, his plane hijacked by a Mr Calloway who is pointing a gun at him and telling him to land at Little Cayman. The plane is low on fuel and Woody says we have to land on Grand Cayman, we will run out of fuel before we get there. On approach below the cloud ceiling they hit a flock of pelicans and the plane crashes into the sea. Miraculously Woody survives as does Calloway, and they reach shore and Calloway disappears. Switch to 46 years later and Eddie Rains is has landed on Grand Cayman to try and find the wreck of the plane and get some answers to his Father\u2019s death. A letter he found after his mother died was mailed by his father from Little Cayman the day after the plane went down. The story is fascinating and entertaining, and characters we have met in other books appear. Great writing by four great authors!",

                "reviewText": "I am a fan of Wayne Stinnett and all of his works. When he began collaborating with these other authors, I was thrilled with the result of the first book they wrote. Now this second.... Wow! Fantastic!These authors clearly work well together and wrote each character as their creators did. I was toying with the idea of beginning the other authors' series after I read Graceless. But after reading Timeless, I am no longer toying with the idea and am ready to pick up those books now. As a matter of fact, I have samples of all their firsts already downloaded. I am already looking forward to reading the next book in the tropical adventures to see what new authors I can find.This book was so well written in following Eddie as he searched to discover what happened to his father. I loved the flashbacks to his father and what happened to him. It gave a needed backstory to correlate with the present day search. Love how each main character interacted together too.I could go on and on but I'll just end with: Ahh, well done!",

It's almost 5 stars except for the silly plot thread where the good guys hold a sexy party at an abandoned house to lure the bad guy in. Seriously?Otherwise, I liked the characters, especially our hero. The others were a little over the top but squeezing them into a plot line was tight.It was a page turner, and I loved most of it, especially the flying and island life.",

The blending of the various characters, the split timelines made for some exciting reading.When I read a book I hear the voices of the characters and from the description of the islands, the various locations in them I can visualize all that's going on. When I can't, such as what a particular boat or plane looks like, good ole Google comes to my rescue.I read Graceless and will now begin Shameless.. I pre-order as they're still writing. I recommend this book and all the books by these guys, you won't be disappointed.",

The search, forged from sketchy clues is a rollercoaster ride gathering momentum as volunteers share long hidden information generating paths to follow. It's a great read, yeah!",

Again I have to say I wish it was longer guys, guess you'll just have to keep writing more. If you've only dipped your toes in the Tropical Authers waters before this is a perfect way to meet their characters and discover new treasures. Good reading!",
