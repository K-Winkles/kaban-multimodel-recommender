                "reviewText": "The Stone Arch line of graphic novels has a distinctive style that is conceptually and artistically consistent. The front-cover layout of the various graphic novel adaptations of classical and modern works displays the same multi-frame reel below an angled-banner title. Each work opens with a chapter of contents, followed by an \u201cabout\u201d section introducing the main character, and then followed by a two-page spread of the \u201ccast of characters.\u201dThe young reader is oriented to the story before they even start to read it. Introductions are how we act in real life, and I always appreciate a book that takes that \u201chow do you do\u201d approach.Each book also ends with a glossary, a feature that adds a serious touch to the comic lineage of the graphic novel. The Common Core reading and writing questions at the book\u2019s end are unnecessary, and I would prefer those two extra pages be given over to the story. Maybe Stone Arch is angling for the respectable and lucrative library and school market. It\u2019s a killjoy move, though.I won\u2019t hold it against them though because of the attention to detail in the artwork and narration. The \u201cretelling authors\u201d do an outstanding job of distilling complex storylines - and in the original works, oftentimes difficult language \u2013 into descriptive but concise boxed and bubble text boxes that is perfectly paired with the arresting artwork.Hercules is a strong work - one of the many in this exceptional line of graphic books.",

                "reviewText": "While not a proponent of Common Core myself, I can still wholeheartedly recommend Martin Powelll's retelling of the story of Hercules to students and adults alike. Having taught Greek mythology numerous times over the years, the labours of Hercules were certainly not new material to me, but I found Martin Powell's approach to the stories so refreshing and engaging and Jos\u00e9 Ruiz' artwork so vibrant so that I wish I had had a classroom set of The Adventures of Hercules when I was still teaching. As it is, I look forward to letting my grade-school aged great nephew amd niece read it the next time they visit. For younger readers (for whom this material is completely appropriate) as well as for less proficient older readers (who will enjoy the story just as enthusiastically), the graphic novel includes a helpful glossary at the end.",

It\u2019s great to get him away from an iPod for awhile (even though he is a very good reader). I think he really loved the illustrations. This was the first graphic novel I bought him. I\u2019m looking forward to giving him The Iliad and the Odyssey.
