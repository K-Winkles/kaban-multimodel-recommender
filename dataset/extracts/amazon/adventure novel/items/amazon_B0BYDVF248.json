While the writing is excellent, the storyline contains a bit of fantasy which sort of threw me. At one point, there are pages of conversation back and forth with a killer and a former Marshal, while there is a gun pointed at the head of his wife. The discussion is sort of tit-for-tat but really didn\u2019t seem to belong in a western. The bear was another bit of a stretch but as I said, the writing itself is great.",

                "reviewText": "This story is about a former lawman Benjamin Bamford and his wife Marla as they are migrating west when their trip is interrupted by the discovery of a heinous crime, which calls him back to his days as a lawman as he tries to find the real killer so as to eliminate himself and his wife as suspects. There is also an old, corrupt sheriff, whose interaction with Benjamin makes him see how far he has fallen, but he gets the opportunity to redeem himself as a lawman. The story is as much as \u201cwho done-it\u201d as it is a Western as Ben and Sheriff Carmichael try to piece together sparse clues and talk to the sheriff\u2019s friends among the criminal element in an attempt to find something. There is a very exciting climax as they come face-face with the killer. Overall if you can look past a few historical inconsistencies and a little strange dialogue between Benjamin and the killer, you should thoroughly enjoy this book.",
