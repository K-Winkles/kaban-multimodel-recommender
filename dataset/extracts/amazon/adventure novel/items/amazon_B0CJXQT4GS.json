                "reviewText": "This is the story of a man, Caleb Diablo returning from the War Between the States, hoping to settle on his parents\u2019 Texas Ranch, put down roots, and live peacefully. However, that is not to be as immediate, the stage he is riding home on is robbed and his best friend murdered. He finds out that the outlaw gang that killed his friend is terrorizing the ranches in his town, forcing people off their land and he pledges to bring them to justice. Along the way, he meets Rich Bowen and his daughter Sammie. He is a former sheriff and she is a crack shot and they have been hunting this gang of outlaws. Caleb teams up with Rich and Sammie and begins their quest to bring down the Jackson gang. Readers of Ethan Westfield have come to expect some familiar traits: a very well-written story about good vs evil and greed, lots of great action and adventure, with a small dose of romance and he delivers magnificently. Like most of his books, the story is long with a few plot twists but flows quite well and is really easy to read. I enjoyed reading this novel and I think you will too.",

Sammie and her father had been chasing the outlaw Jackson and became friends with Caleb and his parents. The problem they faced together was the lack of success of the town's sheriff and mayor in putting an end of Jackson's terror in the community. Everything Caleb and Sammie's families tried to do only seemed to increase the terror of the Jackson gang. It all seemed hopeless, until secrets came to light.",

Irritating to me, and shouldn't be allowed to sneak through. The final blow was in the Extended Epilog, where the ranch house was spoken of as being his childhood home, when, in fact, the childhood ranch house burned to the ground at the end of the story, and a new one was built.These Extended Epilogs almost ALWAYS have errors in them that irritate me into not wanting to read them.... and I wish I had not this time.
