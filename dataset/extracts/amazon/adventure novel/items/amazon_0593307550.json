                "reviewText": "I enjoyed discovering the Scaredy Squirrel picture books when I first started working at the library, so I was interested in reading this graphic novel, which moves the character into books for a different age range while still capturing familiar elements of the storytelling style. This book will be a good option for reluctant readers, and for children who are aging into chapter books and have an existing appreciation for the character.The story is simple and not a lot happens, and the book mainly revolves around explaining the main character's anxieties, but children will enjoy the humorous details and cute drawings, and Scaredy Squirrel's fear of germs and struggle with social anxiety will be relatable to many children, especially as society begins to adjust to regular life routines again after the pandemic's disruption. However, nothing about this story is specific to COVID-19. It may meet an especially broad audience right now, but can continue to appeal over future years as a fun book about a memorable character, and a story that will help anxious kids feel understood and also laugh at anxiety a little bit.I will look forward to future installments in this graphic novel series, and it will appeal to kids who have enjoyed series like Narwhal and Jelly, and are looking for other simple, easy-to-read graphic novels with animal characters.",

As in the picture book series, he spends the majority of his time in his nut tree thinking about everything that could go wrong.Great illustrations, humor and simple text is engaging and perfect for young beginning readers. My 7 year old son and I read it together and couldn\u2019t help smiling as we read. I plan to share with my students when it releases at the end of May as they are big Scaredy squirrel fans!
