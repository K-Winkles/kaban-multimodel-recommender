All opinions are my own.Book: Daughter of ChaosAuthor: Sarah Rees BrennanBook Series: The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Book 2Rating: 5/5Diversity: trans male, openly LGBT couplings mentionedPublication Date: December 26, 2019Genre: YA FantasyRecommended Age: 16+ (some violence and gore, some mature content like sex and sex activities mentioned)Publisher: Scholastic Inc.Pages: 368Amazon LinkSynopsis: Half-witch, half-mortal sixteen-year-old Sabrina Spellman has made her choice: She's embraced her dark side and her witchy roots. Now her power is growing daily... but will it come at too high a price?Sabrina Spellman has just made the hardest decision of her life: She's leaving behind her beloved friends at Baxter High. Now it's time to follow the path of night and find her way among the witches and warlocks at the Academy of Unseen Arts.Sabrina has always been good at the school thing, but now she has a whole new world to navigate. Her power is growing daily, but it comes with a high price. She must always remember her new allegiances and the cost they have on her friends... and on herself.And then there's her new classmates. Prudence, Dorcas, and Agatha are friends, kind of, but can Sabrina trust them? And what about Nick Scratch? He's as charming as ever, but will his feelings for Sabrina last?Based on the hit Netflix show, this original YA novel tells an all-new, original story about Sabrina.Review: I love the show Sabrina with a passion\u2026 maybe an obsession? I have so much love for the current show, respect for the comics, and admiration for the previous 90s show. The prequel book perfectly embodies all three and this one maintained that embodiment! I love that these books are apart of the in-between times, the times that are glossed over and the development not seen as deep as the show can provide to an audience within 40 minutes. The character development in this book, especially with Harvey and Roz\u2019s relationship which kinda popped up suddenly in the show, is so great! Nick Scratch and Prudence also got developed and trust me, I\u2019m not the biggest Pru fan but I\u2019m totally feeling for her now that I\u2019ve read this book. The book was also well written and had fun nods to the current season playing on Netflix.The only thing I will say about the book is that it\u2019s a little slow paced in the beginning as we go back to the early days post breakup with Sabrina and Harvey, but it quickly picks up and mayhem ensues sure enough! Also, if you\u2019re a fan of the show it does take a bit getting used to Theo being called Suzie in the books but it also heavily develops him as well before the transition!Verdict: A must read for the Sabrina lover in all of us.",

                "reviewText": "Note: this is a companion novel to the tv series, so although you could probably read it as a stand-alone, I don\u2019t really recommend it. It\u2019s easiest to at least know who is who and what it is all about.ReviewSo Sabrina had to sign her name away in the devil\u2018s book to save her hometown from destruction, that is where \u201eDaughter of Chaos\u201c starts. Her friend and her mortal boyfriend Harvey now know that she and her aunts are witches and because Harvey\u2019s brother got killed by witches (and he is a descendant of witch-hunters), he hates magic. Subsequently, he and Sabrina are broken up, both still suffer from heartache and their foursome of friends is at a crossroads.Things get worse when Sabrina attracts bad luck breaking loads of glass and witches and mortals alike suffer the consequences. I can\u2019t tell you more, because spoilers and so on, but just like with the prequel, things escalate in dramatic ways. I like S. Rees Brennan\u2019s writing, the way things turn bad and dangerous in slight and subtle ways, until it\u2019s full out fight for your lives everyone. And the atmosphere again feels like its own character, the small town that is on the one hand full of nice neighbors and a good community and on the other hand a place where things look bleak a lot, where people are lonely and demons linger more often than not.And last not least, the characters that each have their own POVs are all interesting and I loved following all their thoughts. What surprised me was that this time, it wasn\u2019t Sabrina that was my hero, although she is marvelous. No, my heart ached for Harvey and although Nick is cool and everything, I think Harvey Kinkle is a great character for feeling so real and for making my heart go out to him, even though he is the silent kind of hidden hero. The witches and his father think him weak (even Sabrina stays away to keep him from her dangerous life), but he is actually the strongest one around. Not in power, but in heart and mind (and I can\u2019t believe, I wrote such a sentence). Great book.",
