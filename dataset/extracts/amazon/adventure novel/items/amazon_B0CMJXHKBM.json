Her mixed up feeling she had towards her dad, after spending time with the gang, were very well handled. The story kept a mystery going over the whole length of the book. Hank\u2019s gang was probably meaner in real life than the author shows in the book. The soft side of some of the gang was a surprise in their attitude. Some of the problems Aaron caused should have gotten him into more trouble. The personalities of all the characters were handled very well, showing how people from a different time period thought. Read and enjoy. Very good book.",
