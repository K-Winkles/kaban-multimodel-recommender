People\u2019s attitudes changed from carry guns to no carry guns, no cowboys and no Indians. This book could have been written in any time period and worked. Merl and Frank worked good together and were natural\u2019s get along with people. Cass was an unnatural part that worked out in the story as it went along. She belong in the 1850\u2019s. She and Merl didn\u2019t have a common thread to connect them into the semi-romantic part of the book. The author does good setting the characters attitudes and personalities up so to have the right mix to make the book work. Read and enjoy.",
