                "reviewText": "Genuinely incredible! This one is my favorite so far.The crystal kingdom act in the podcast is so long, there was no way they could realistically fit everything into the comic book so obviously some parts are missing but the final result they came up with is perfect. Some scenes feel rushed if you know how long they were originally, but in the comic it works great.I found myself thinking at some point that if this had a different art style it would look terrifying. The thing with all the souls and the ghosts with the faces? Oof. But still, I prefer this style. Genuinely loved every page.And I knew it was coming but I adored the queerness added to this arc. We got a treat already with Sloane and Hurley in pedals to the metal, but the new queer characters were chef\u2019s kiss.Oh and Magnus telling Kravitz \u201ctell Julia I finished the chair\u201d hits different now that I know who Julia is \ud83e\udd7a I didn\u2019t know when I heard the podcast.Anyway, the more I listen and the more I read, the more excited I get about this. TAZ was never on my list of possible future obsessions but here we are.",

If you\u2019re thinking about purchasing the Crystal Kingdom book, then you\u2019ve probably read the previous three books and are familiar with the art style and story. Still consistent in those two areas.I mainly wanted to write this review so that I could attach pictures for the hardcover version. I was interested in the hardcover versions, but wasn\u2019t sure how different they were from the paperback versions. The pictures show different sides of the book. The hardcover version is a bit taller and thicker than the paperback. I think the hardcover version is of nice quality and it looks really good. The hardcover has a dust jacket that has the same design as the paperback. Nothing different between the two when it comes to content. Hope the pictures help.I\u2019m enjoying these books a lot. Can\u2019t wait for the next one.",

Just finished Crystal Kingdom and can\u2019t wait to read it again. Really appreciate how this chapter in the arc was adapted, especially fond of how Carey Pietsch draws Noelle, and how she depicts the budding romance between Taako and Kravitz. But, the star of this show might just be our favorite Dragonborn \u2026 (also) Carey. Loved every scene she appears in. Really tremendous work all around and I look forward to seeing what marvelous gift I find in the mail next July <3",

Pietsch does such a great job of staying true to the franchise and you can tell the effort and love that went into the illustrations. Tons of cute easter eggs, references to MBMBAM, and other fun nods in nearly every panel. I can't wait to own the whole series!! Totally worth the wait :)",
