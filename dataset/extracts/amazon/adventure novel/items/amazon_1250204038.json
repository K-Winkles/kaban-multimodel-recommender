                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The Last Flight of the Arctic Terns",
                "reviewText": "This story is set in a not-too-distant future when climate change, overhunting and overfishing is causing major species extinction and the disappearance of birds and fish. A troubled young woman, Franny Lynch, joins the crew of a fishing boat to follow what is believed to be the last flock of arctic terns on their journey from the arctic to the Antarctic. The arctic tern is the bird species with the longest annual migration of any species. They fly over 9000 miles each way from Greenland to Antarctica. Franny attaches GPS locators to some of the birds and uses her computer to track them. The fishing boat crew agrees to take her on because they believe that following the terns will help them catch fish, something that has become increasingly difficult.There are tensions between Franny and the crew because she is untrained and therefore dangerous to herself and perhaps others, and also because she is a \u201cgreenie\u201d, an environmentalist, and fishing boat crews and \u201cgreenies\u201d don\u2019t get along well at a time when fishing is threatening ocean life. However, as they get to know each other bonds develop between her and most other crew members. It turns out everyone aboard has their own dramatic stories that intersect in surprising ways. It becomes increasingly clear that Franny\u2019s obsession with the terns is much more than an ecological interest.The story jumps back in time 19 years, 12 years, 8 years, 4 years, 12 months, forming parallel story lines, all with their own mysteries. The author is making it clear when you switch time period and she is keeping the stories distinct, even though they naturally are interrelated, so despite the different timelines it is easy to follow everything that is going on. The different timelines also allow you to follow how and why wildlife has deteriorated during the years leading up to Franny\u2019s big journey.Franny\u2019s family was very troubled, and her past was difficult and her self-destructive tendencies and inability to stay around and commit to relationships is a thread throughout the book that creates drama, surprises and interesting subplots. As you read the book, mysteries are added, and the mysteries grow until they are finally explained in ways that were to me entirely surprising yet making perfect sense. This made it almost impossible to put the book down.The book is a real page turner. It is full of interesting subplots, surprises, revelations, and drama coupled with complicated but very believable characters. The character development is excellent, and I can imagine the actors who will play whom in case the book will be used for a future movie. The book also brings attention to the current emerging extinction event created by us and how this will create conflict in society, at the same time as it highlights the humanity of people regardless on which side we are on. The book points out that we are self-destructive, as a species but also in our own lives. I highly recommend this book.",

                "reviewText": "I saw so many strong reviews for this one last year, so I\u2019m glad I made time for it! I think winter is a good time to read this one as much of it is set around icebergs and cold water.Franny Stone is an interesting and complex character. As the book progresses, we are teased with hints about events in her life and they are slowly explained. She has experienced such adversity and loss in her life that it was heartbreaking. She has a habit of leaving when things start to overwhelm her. The overall premise is a depressing one, the world and climate change have finally driven all animals into extinction, even birds and most fish.Franny starts out on one last quest to follow a few remaining Arctic terns as they make their migration to Antarctica. She has to smooth talk her way onto a fishing boat and convince the boat captain that following the terns will lead to one last big catch. She is on a migration with the birds but also to find belonging herself and maybe forgiveness.This one is dark and powerful with a few glimmers of hope, perhaps viewed as a cautionary tale that we need to make many more changes to keep animals in our world. I found myself rooting for this damaged woman and I wasn\u2019t quite sure how it would end.",

                "reviewText": "It's hard to explain how a book about the extermination of species in the Anthropocene could be so beautiful and even uplifting. Terrible things happen to the main character, who I grew to deeply love. Terrible things are happening in this world of the near future, which will be our actual future, if we don't come together to solve the climate crisis\u2013\u2013and do so quickly. This book is an example of the power of art to uplift even as it speaks of tragedy and brokenness. This book is so beautiful and skillfully written, so strange and mystical. And whether or not you love birds, this book will open your eyes to their plight and their great beauty.",

                "reviewText": "There are no surprises here. The \u201crevelations\u201d and end of the search were, to me, quite what I expected. The current journey, and the interwoven thread of the main character\u2019s life to the point of the journey, give readers an immersive insight into her frenzied yet determined mind. With the layers of characters who\u2019ve influenced her and vivid descriptions of all she has encountered, that somewhat expected ending wasn\u2019t predictable as much as it was just settling and peaceful.I will have to, if I have time, read back through for more descriptions of who she is with at the end; I was a bit confused about how she readily recognized and welcomed that particular person, but it\u2019s quite possible I breezed over something to explain that better-I did read this, for the most part, late at night as my eyes were trying to slam shut.I do understand the urgency of the message of conservation, and in no way in denial the atmosphere could be a reality at some point, but I do feel like the hints were more like rocks being thrown at my head. I don\u2019t read fiction for the lectures; I read fiction for pleasure, for escape-so that tone was a bit overdone and off-putting for me.",
