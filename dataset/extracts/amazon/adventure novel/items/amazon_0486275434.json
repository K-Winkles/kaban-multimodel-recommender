It has got original nice illustrations by John Tenniel which is aesthetically significant. The price is great. This Kindle edition has got good line spacings and is excellent to read on my Kindle keyboard. Don't spend your money on other kindle editions of Alice as they have either queer or no illustrations. The only disadvantage is being difficult to navigate through chapters. It doesn't worry me though. The other good news is you will get the entire series in one download.

I tried several other Kindle editions available and had found them truly appalling in terms of formatting. This however, is significantly better, featuring well structured chapter breaks and all the original illustrations, which enhance the story a lot.Furthermore, considering it contains both books, plus the excellent Hunting of the Snark, it is a fantastic price.However, there are still some glaring mistakes, such as some formatting bugs in a few of the poems and spelling errors in places (such as at the start of Looking Glass, where some of the Ls are replaced with 1s - I guess a scanner did the 'writing here').5 stars for the great price and superior formatting over the other options. -1 star for the glaring lack of proof reading from the publisher.",

I've read that Carroll said that it was written to be purely nonsense for nonsense sake (my words not a quote!) and I think I'm ok with that! I loved Disney's version as a child and many other adaptations over the years. I can't believe it took me so long to actual read this! I do hope Alice never lost her imagination as we adults tend to do. Reading Alice's adventures helps us recall a bit of that fantastical, nonsensical world of childhood.",

This is the first time I have seen all four areas of LC in one book. \"Alice's Adventures Underground\" and \"Wonderland are very similar. but I did enjoy reading \"The Hunting of the Snark\" and \"Through the Looking Glass\". It helps a lot when reading the Looking Glass if one understands the rules of Chess, and also plays the game, both of which I do! If one doesn't understand chess at all, some of the literature in \"The Looking Glass\" is likely to be confusing. I would strongly recommend studying the rules of Chess before reading.That aside, it is a classic piece of literature. I have heard it said that \"Wonderland\" is one of LC's visions when he had a Grand Mal (apparently he was epileptic) but having got this condition myself (extremely well-controlled I might add). I am not sure if this is true. Nevertheless, this is a welcome addition to my ever growing collection! Well worth reading!",

Questo libro straordinario non pu\u00f2 essere scisso dalla lingua in cui \u00e8 stato scritto, e infatti ho amato la versione originale! Uno scoppio di immaginazione assolutamente geniale e irripetibile, un uso del linguaggio meraviglioso. Che altro dire! Non penso che possa definirsi un libro per bambini.",
