        "description": "The winds of change are about to fill the sails of Jack Drayton\u2026A penniless young man living on a barge on the Thames in 1903 London, Jack Drayton is unsure of where his life is heading. He\u2019s trying to decide what to do with himself next when he meets a peculiar stranger. Needing a ride to shore one evening, Jack hitches a ride from this stranger, who speaks, dresses, and behaves as though he\u2019s stepped out of another era. After Jack helps the man escape a fracas in town, he tells Jack that he is in fact Black Juan Gaskara, an infamous pirate, and claims that he\u2019s on the run for his life.Now, that would be all fine and good, except for the fact that the real Black Juan Gaskara would have to be over 112 years old; or more logically, dead.Despite his disbelief however, Jack is intrigued by the man. Especially when he learns of the treasure that Gaskara has apparently hidden on Peril Island, a place only known to Black Juan.Before Juan is murdered by descendants of the crew he double-crossed over the loot, he leaves Jack with a cryptogram and map that will reveal where the treasure is hidden. Now it's up to Jack to recover the treasure before Black Juan\u2019s enemies \u2013 who wish to use it to set up a global crime empire \u2013 get their hands on it first. With his best friend Hector at his side, Jack must venture on the dangerous ocean journey of a lifetime, following the cryptic clues to uncover the treasure before Gaskara\u2019s foes put an end to his search\u2026and his life!Using a 1903 novel as the foundation, author C.W. James creates a fast-paced and thrilling historical novel that will capture the imagination of young adult audiences and hold them fast until the very last page. Perfect for casual readers and bibliophiles alike, The Treasure of Peril Island is the kind of book that will ignite one\u2019s love of reading, or continue to kindle the existing flame. A classic story of adventure, mystery, pirate curses and hidden treasure, this is the optimal book to add to any teen library!",

Set in the early 1900's and with a wee bit of magic, the protagonist serendipitously comes across a ruthless pirate who should be long dead. The adventure begins.This is a story of friendship, loyalty, and being truthful to one's word. It is a story of trust and humility and admitting when one has made a mistake. The five hour read is engrossing and almost impossible to put down until finished. I wish this were a series but am content with this most likely HEA end.

James, Jack Drayton takes a boat ride full of adventures and mysteries that unravel as the reader dives into a story full of fun. Jack runs into a pirate who tells him about treasure hidden on Peril Island. From decoding hidden messages to fighting pirates, the path Jack follows to Peril Island is anything but smooth. A ship burns and Jack saves his friends and himself while continuously keeping his mind thinking one step ahead. But what will happen when even Jack doesn\u2019t know what to do?Opinion:The Treasure of Peril Island by C. W. James is a good book stuffed with adventure and mystery. Yet, because of the way the author wrote the book, I felt like the scenes were changing too fast. I had a hard time keeping up with all of the characters and was losing my interest in the book. Something I did like about The Treasure of Peril Island was how the story was full of suspense and mystery. During the parts that were suspenseful, I didn\u2019t want to put the book down, but afterwards I felt like it was a bit boring. I would recommend this book to kids ages 12+ because of the content and plot.",
