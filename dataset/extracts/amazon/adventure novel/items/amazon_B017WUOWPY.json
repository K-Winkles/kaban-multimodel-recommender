He writes with the wideness of great poetry. My inner man, whatever the hell that is, has somehow awakened. I feel it. There is a pulse where there was no pulse before. Dylan's imagery moves me. I'm not easily moved. I'm not drawn to the darkness but more aware of it now. It surrounds us. Dylan delves into and exposes a spiritual reality that few can convey. I pray that he doesn't lose his mind. I want him around for a long, long time. What must his mama have been thinking watching him grow up!",
