        "description": "After a terrible defeat in Key West, where the subject of Jesse McDermitt\u2019s identity fraud investigation gets away, and which almost costs him dearly, Jesse returns home to his island in the Content Keys, determined to keep those he loves safe from harm.He makes plans to fly his family and friends to the Leeward Islands for a very special occasion, unaware of events taking place on one small uninhabited island located a short distance from his destination\u2014events that will suck him right back into the fray, as a past nemesis rears their head.Gold will turn even the most docile into greedy, dangerous people. When the question of rightful ownership is brought up, legal professionals and government officials on the island, as well as those from France argue over a treasure estimated to be worth $20,000,000. But what is the price of one human life?The simple life isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be, and danger abounds in the picturesque city of Gustavia, on the French island of St. Barts, and speeding Mini Mokes on steep mountain roads isn\u2019t the cause.",

It truly was a story well told. My only complaint was one I mention often. As Jesse often says, agood plan never survives the first encounter of a battle. However, in way to many stories in this series, the final battle works out perfectly as planned with no real harm to any of the good guys. That doesn't match reality and it always makes the ending feel a little artificial. The book was absolutely a five star read. However, the formulamatic ending to the final battle with the bad guys where the good guys come thru with no one suffering any harm or injury and the bad guys all got caught made the ending a bit of a let down. In the early days of this series, like in the real world, their was the joy of victory muted with the pain that comes from great harm to team of one or more good guys. I miss that bit of imposition of the real world being mixed in with the ultimate victory.",

I know his books take a great deal of research, but he must spend so much of his time just fantasizing about what these guys (and gals) could get up to. I have truly enjoyed every single one of his books. You can start at the beginning of the series or you can start with the first one you find available to you and THEN go back to the first one and read them all in order- which is what I did. However you read them, just do it and you will have so many great adventures to take part in. This is what I recommend for you if you are the sort of person that likes oceans and islands and the adventures that happen there.",
