            "Editorial Reviews About the Author Clint McElroy is a 45-year veteran of broadcasting who now works on the popular podcast THE ADVENTURE ZONE, with his sons Justin, Travis and Griffin. He is one of the co-writers of THE ADVENTURE ZONE graphic novels, along with WAR OF THE REALMS: JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY, for Marvel Comics, and MARVEL TEAM-UP. He\u2019s currently working on an animated The Adventure Zone TV show for NBC\u2019s Peacock streaming service. He has three BEST DAD coffee mugs and six BEST GRANDPA...although the titles have been challenged.Meet the McElroys! Clint was born first, which recent studies have shown is the best procedure for fathers and sons. Justin came along twenty-five years later, two weeks late, actually, which caused his mother, Leslie, some consternation and more than a little back pain. Three years to the day (yes, the very day) Travis came along, forever ruining Justin\u2019s birthday, at least according to Justin. The decision was made to not have a third child born on November 8th, so Griffin arrived three-and-a-half years later on April 17th. There followed this decade and that, during which there was a lot of school, theater, broadcasting, video games, moving around the country and various and sundry monkeyshines. Then came a time for fewer monkeyshines, so a ton of marriages happened and people were added to the family branch. In the midst of all this begetting, podcasts began springing up in even greater abundance and their names were My Brother My Brother and Me (which spawned a popular tv show), Sawbones, Shmanners, Wonderful, and a farcical romp called The Adventure Zone.Carey Pietsch is a cartoonist based out of Brooklyn, NY. Her work includes drawing two arcs of Lumberjanes and the artwork for the Mages of Mystralia webcomic. Carey also makes Keepsakes and other original comics about magic and empathy. Along with brightening her workdays, The Adventure Zone got her to join a D&D campaign, where she\u2019s currently playing a dragonborn sorcerer who cares too much about romance novels."
