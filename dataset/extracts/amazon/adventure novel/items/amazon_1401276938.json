I love pretty much everything that's in the styles of Batman the Animated Series, which most of this book was. The one story in the style of The Batman was interesting, and I might hunt down more of them at some point. The Batman Beyond story at the end was also very good; Spellbinder is one of my favorite villains from that series and it was cool to see him in print (Bruce back in the batsuit, if only for a few pages). Overall, this was good collection, and it is one that I would recommend or gift to others over a wide age range.",

                "reviewText": "I cannot get enough of comic books that are based upon the 90s Batman Animated Series! So I read this volume that is subtitled \u201cHis greatest adventures.\u201d I read this alongside my daughters as well and they also enjoyed it. I love the graphics and images of the 90s Batman animated series.The first story is titled \u201cBatman and Ronin Birdcage\u201d that is about Batman taking on Penguin with his crazy plots to help exotic birds; there\u2019s quite an irony in this story! The second story is titled \u201cTroubled Dreams\u201d and consists of two acts where Scarecrow trying to use chemicals to induce fear on people. After that there is a story titled \u201cThe Cat\u2019s Prize\u201d that was less like the 90s Animated series with the illustrations of Batman and accompanying characters. Following this is a short story called Poker Face which describes a time when Penguin is the Mayor of Gotham and the Riddler is supposedly an up-right citizen. The next story is \u201cJoker\u2019s Late Night Lunacy\u201d which consists of three acts followed by a Batman Beyond story called Grounded. I didn\u2019t expect the Batman Beyond character in this volume.Overall it was great short stories and clean and fun. Other than the Batman Beyond story in the end which threw my daughters off I think the kids enjoyed it. I like how it was fun, kid friendly but not cheesy. I also like how I can read this to my kids while enjoying it as an adult also as well. DC Comics: If only they can make more comics like this!",

                "reviewText": "Six stories, mostly from the 1990s, are told in this volume. Batman faces off against The Penguin, The Joker, The Riddler, Catwoman, and other assorted rogues (though the two cover villains, Two-Face and Poison Ivy, are not in the book at all). The stories follow the classic Batman model where he solves a mystery crafted by the bad guy and comes out one step (or punch) ahead. The art style is clearly inspired by Batman: The Animated Series, though occasional differences are distracting (who thinks Catwoman with gigantic ears looks good?). I appreciated that the story telling and art are kid-friendly without being dumbed down or boring. Batman does make a good noir character, but he doesn't always have to be bloody, dark, and bitter.Recommended, but don't be fooled by the title. These are not Batman's greatest adventures but they are good ones.",
