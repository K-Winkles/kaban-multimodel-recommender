The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is bc I\u2019m a big reader\u2014 and the writing was pretty simple- not many details or descriptions like a book person might be used to\u2014 but never the less this was SUCH a fun read.The reader is gender neutral, and a highschool student who, like Nancy, is obsessed with journalism and aspires to be a reporter for the paper. Reading level is appropriate for kids who are advanced enough to read a kid/tween novel, and equally as entertaining for adults.",

Nello specifico, riprende la quarta stagione della serie, seguendone gli avvenimenti, ma in modo assolutamente piatto e senza colpi di scena. Non succede assolutamente nulla in pratica in tutto il libro se non un paio di situazioni in cui davvero scegliere una delle due opzioni ha una qualche valenza. I finali sono orribili, anche quelli \"corretti\", lo scontro finale con Vecna non \u00e8 nemmeno descritto ma completamente sorvolato. Insomma, non ne vale la pena, risparmiate i soldi e comprate altro.",
