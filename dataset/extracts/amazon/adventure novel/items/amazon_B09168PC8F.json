                "reviewText": "Another Home Run. Boring I know. One reason I love this author is because he is a great writer. And he is influenced by the great John D MacDonald who wrote the Travis McGee series back in the day. When that author died, I was stationed in Turkey as a young 2 striper in the Air Force. My Mom wrote me a letter (no computer back then) and broke the bad news to me. John D had written the Lonely Silver Rain and told us of his discovery of the long lost daughter he never knew he had, (he being Travis). So now we have Jesse who has discovered his family, but not too late. And now we explore that dynamic, something Travis did not get to do. So thank you Wayne. Another great novel. John D would be proud. For you readers who are looking for a new book, a new series, a new author? Read this book but first? Order the previous 20 or so. I'm a 57 year old dude who has read a great many novels. And many authors. Get this book, followo this dude, and read all his stuff. He's a stud. Highly recommend. What's it about? An X Gunny who has been there and done that. From an old retired Master Sergeant? You can't find a better author.",

His responsibilities are larger than personal scale balancing.Some good news - for those of you who were getting thirsty because his boat wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing on plane\u201d (take a drink) as much in his last couple of stories, now you can transition to taking a drink each time he \u201cputs his cover (hat) on the table\u201d.If you do, make sure you don\u2019t have to drive anywhere while reading this episode.As far as intrigue, there are several places where you will be pulled forward to find out exactly who, of several possibilities, is in danger. What will happen next, etc.",

                "reviewText": "In the 22nd book chronicling the life, times, crusades and fights of Jesse McDermitt, he's making adjustments . He and his wife are now parents to a nine year old boy, he's now captain of a 199 foot yacht belonging to uber wealthy Jack Armstrong, whose foundation combines marine research with crime fighting, he has an expanded crew with new responsibilities, and the man he looked up to for years is dying.Be advised - if you've ever lost a loved one, you'll be moved to tears. And if you've ever been witness to marriage proposals, you'll giggle. Nice touches as Jesse ages and realized he's got others to do for him. That's where Stinnett might have done a more thorough job - dealing with the transition from single/solitary to leader/group. Twenty one books of the guy being fiercely independent and in one book he's fully evolved? Could have used a litt!e more work.But there are the usual things that show up in McDermott stories: a fascination with weapons, military history, damsels in distress and rescued. And a promise of more to come - with a bigger boat!",

His story has grown over the years, spawning spin-offs as the number of people introduced into his storylines outgrew their roles as Jesse sidekicks. They had stories if their own to tell. Jesse, himself, has spawned this new series because there's just too much of Jesse McDermitt to keep on the same course. Jesse is older now, wiser and more experienced. He needed a bigger stage to play on. If you want to get the full experience of Jesse and the other players that point out what it really means to be American, start at book one and grow with Jesse and his friends.",

There is normally fast paced action which is also well described. The only slight complaint I have is that I thought the ending was a bit game.However I did enjoy the book.",
