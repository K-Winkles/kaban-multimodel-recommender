                "reviewText": "If your reader loves horses, this is hands down, our favorite author! Susan Count writes so fluidly, with such realism, it transports BOTH adult and child into the story! Grandma gave us our first Susan Count book, Selah's Sweet Dream. We actually waited on this particular book (Mary's Song) due to the content, but purely for personal reasons - the content is clean and appropriate even for younger readers as well as older, and my daughter started reading these when she was 6 or 7 because she is an advanced/avid reader - but these are PERFECT to encourage the slower reader to practice and advance quickly! You will not be disappointed! I actually was sad when my daughter sped through it without me! hahaha!",

                "reviewText": "Due to a virus, Mary (12) is in a wheelchair, unable to walk. The year is 1952. Her father, determined to find a cure, is a little over-protective. Mary enjoys sketching the horses in the field next door. Unable to attend school thus having a private tutor, Mary is thrilled when her next door neighbor, Laura (12), comes over to say \"Hello\". Laura's parents are the opposite of Mary's dad, not taking much notice of Laura at all. (Mary's mother has been dead for several years.) Laura's mother is more concentrated on her equitation.Buggy rides! What fun for a girl who has always dreamed that she will ride. What's so special about the filly, Illusion? Why do the girls have to come up with a scheme to save her? Is there a cure for Mary?WARNING: Some parts of this story give sad impressions of what may happen. If you have a sensitive child there may be tears before the end!Book has a good ending. There is no cliff hanger although it does leave you wanting to read the next one. The writing is okay. I found it a little stilted at times BUT I am an adult. A child reading this would likely not sense this at all. The book is clean, NO bad language or any inappropriate behavior. For those who want to know, the girls do pray once in a while when things get tough and they do not know what to do.I downloaded this book onto my Kindle. I was not required to write a review but chose to do so. Thanks, Liz",

                "reviewText": "In 1950s America, a girl afflicted by a virus that made her unable to walk (we are not told details, but it doesn't seem to be polio) sits on her father's fine porch and wishes for a horse. Specifically, one of the Morgan foals next door, Illusion, which was born with a club foot. If Illusion could be treated and saved - which is by no means certain - maybe even a lonely girl like Mary could learn to walk as well.The characterisation is finely done and we learn the strengths of determination, friendship and science. I particularly like the references to books of the day. One of the best sequences for me is when the daughter of the horse breeders, Laura, resolves one problem after another by applying what skills and lessons she and her horses have learned. Young readers, especially girls, will learn a great deal and enjoy the adventure. Adult horse lovers will like the unusual story too.This is an unbiased review.",

The author certainly has a great knowledge of all things equine.The young heroin Mary is disabled. She lives on a farm with her father. Most days he would carry her into a field and she would sit on a blanket in the shade of a large tree and draw the mares and foals in the adjacent field.She falls in love with one of the foals, who also has a serious problem with it's leg, and is destined to be put down as nothing can be done about it. However, Mary has other ideas.A lovely inspiring story for all youngsters who love horses.",
