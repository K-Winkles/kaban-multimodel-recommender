                "reviewText": "I picked this up as something interesting to have on my shelves alongside many books of apologetics and reference material. I may have read comics in my younger years, but there is no shame in an adult going through this book to see how the artist interpreted what is written in scripture. If I have kids some day, I would love to have them read through parts of this as they read & hear about the Word of God.This book is a great merging of interests. It reminds me a bit of the comic books which Jack Chick created years ago. He's known for his small, black & white \"Chick tracts,\" but he also made several full color, full size comics.I just got my copy of this book yesterday so I've only had a chance to read through some of it. Since this is a comic book telling of parts of God's Word [imagine the undertaking of putting all of the Word into comic format??], I have to say the art matters, and in this it's very well done! So far I haven't seen anything 'heretical,' so you should be fine giving this to children.I like that each story/section has the scripture references so that (hopefully) a younger one will want to open up his or her bible and read the full story. The visuals and condensed storytelling (a compliment, not a complaint) in this book should help those who are more visual learners.It's also great to see the story of redemption is told chronologically. By that I mean the whole of the bible, e.g. the gospels are 'blended' together. There's even a brief inter-testament section with mention of Alexander the Great and the Maccabees.I was pleased to see two passages which \"made the cut,\" Judges 3:12-30 (it's a bit grim!) and Luke 4:16-30.",

                "reviewText": "Got this for my daughter who has autism but wants to know more about the word of God. This has spiked her interest significantly, and has helped her pick up reading the actual bible to learn God\u2019s word. It\u2019s not like a regular Bible as it is made so kids can understand it in a simple and colourful way, but the spirit of the word is in the book. I see it as a wonderful stepping stone to help kids find interest in God\u2019s word and begin to build their faith independently.",
