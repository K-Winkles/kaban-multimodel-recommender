                "reviewText": "FALLEN HUNTER is Eayne Stinnett's third installment in the Jesse McDermitt Series - and fast becoming my favorite (certainly A favorite). As I've read more about Stinett in his bio, his knowledge of Navy and Marine life, lore & lingo are obviously the result of being a former Marine himself (as am I). Another little tidbit is that he was born & raised within spitting distance of where I was born & raised. Do these facts color my opinion? Well, given I didn't learn them until finishing this, his third book, I hardly think so. But it could explain why I understand so much of character Jesse McDermitt, a former Force Recon Marine retired after twenty years service turned fishing boat/ dive charter boat Captain in the Florida Keys. Though I don't know a thing about diving, or the Florida Keys, I'm all too familiar with the mindset of a former Force Recon Marine. But I'm no Jesse McDermitt, and I believe Jesse is slowly learning he, too, is no longer the man he once was - but he still comes damn close (can't say the same for myself). Jesse has managed to acquire an expensive, large, remarkably fast boat and with the help of an old Marine buddy (and a growing cast characters) lives a life most men can only dream about - interspersed with heartbreak and tragedy. But, surrounded by good friends and brothers-in-arms Jesse manages to survive it all - somehow. And it's the \"somehow\" part that makes for such compelling, page-turning novels that draw you into Jesse's world. With writing this good you can almost smell the salty air and see the vibrant blue sea and remarkable ocean sunsets. And you learn to love Jesse and his many friends, and cry along with his heartbreaks & tragedies just as you do those of your own. For that is the magic that Wayne Stinett brings to this series. He brings Jesse McDermitt to life in a way few authors are capable of doing. And does it better than most. So, if you like adventure stories, love stories, sea stories - or simply a good story, told with outstanding character development, believable dialogue, and real world situations (with just a hint of intrigue and action), then you can't go wrong here. Wayne Stinnett has created a new hero for the ages - and his name is Jesse MsDermitt.",

                "reviewText": "I have truly enjoyed this series. Although it is a series, all the books are totally stand-alone books. That is so appreciated! This is the third book of this series I have read, which I first made acquaintance with from the seven book boxed series, \"Seven Seas Mysteries Boxed Set.\" That is a set of seven books with different authors writing about characters who sail and or live on the seas. It is a wonderful series, VERY reasonably priced, and gives the reader a chance to sample seven different authors. A must read!This book was just a little disappointing to me. When Jesse went below and took off his wedding rings for a woman he had just met after only four months of losing his wife, Alex... well, it just didn't set right with me. I would have liked to have seen him just a little more attached to Alex. The author just didn't let us have time to mourn Alex before she was replaced. A shame! I could see why he let Alex go in the last book of this series, but... then he just takes up with another woman and she takes Alex's place? Just did NOT like that!Also, having Jessie end up in the hospital two times in a row,.nearly dying? Along this line, I wonder if Mr. Stinnett has ever been in ICU? I guarantee him, NO ONE just gets out of a two week induced coma, regains consciousness, and then stands up, walks to the bathroom, then goes out for a steak dinner. As close as it is going to get to a steak dinner for anyone in this condition is beef bouillon. Which tastes as good as a steak dinner. For at least two days. Stomachs just can't handle solids like Jessie did. The one part of the book that I definitely thought the author should have brought more close to reality!The writing is good, but not as good as the other two books, in my estimation. This author is better than this book portrays. When he develops a character, he does a good job. Too well in this instance! Alex was just dropped off too soon. Just because she \"would have wanted him to go on with his life...\" I did, also. Just NOT this soon!The ending, also, left me in a quandary. Was the doctor actually killed or just badly injured? It was just left a little unclear to me.Although I am still wanting to read more of this series, I think a break for awhile would be best for me after these three books. I still miss Alex.",
