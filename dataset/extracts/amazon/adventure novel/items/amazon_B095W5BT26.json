                "reviewText": "I didn't like the main character at all. He sounded too much like he was making excuses for his incredibly horrible behavior. The woman he rescued had no personality to speak of, so I found nothing interesting about her either. The mangaka obviously gave a nod to the writer of a different series with similar circumstances, but it also felt a bit like lazy storytelling and not bothering to do the hard work to build a distinct fantasy world of one's own.Sadly, I waited one day too long to return the ebook for a refund, so I'm just going to delete it from my list and free up the space for better-written material.Kindle keeps pushing the second volume of this series, despite my negative review of the first. Why? I don't want to waste my time and money on poor writing.",
