Together with his band of loyal followers, Robin must win a battle of wits if he is to protect the poor from the scheming Sheriff of Nottingham. Available in paperback format for the first time in the UK, with a new, eye-catching cover design. The colourful comic strip format has proven appeal, particularly for reluctant readers. A map of the world of Robin Hood and background information about the legend give added value. Read more",

                "reviewText": "This is just what I was looking for. My child has started reading a bit, but doesn't have all the vocab and would still find a book 'without any pictures' boring. Graphic novels and comics are a great way to practice reading because even if one doesn't have all the vocab, one can still follow the sense of the story from the pictures and even guess some of the unknown words from the context.This book tells the well-known story of Robin Hood in the form of a graphic novel. Like all tellings of Robin Hood, some of the stories are told a little differently to how I remember them in other versions, but the main themes are all here: how Robin became an outlaw, daring rescues of his comrades, the archery contest in Nottingham and so on. In any case I suppose there is no definitive telling of the story and every version brings new details to discover. The end of the book has a few pages for older readers and how and when the legend of Robin Hood first appeared.The quality of the artwork is excellent, lots of really exciting pictures to catch young imaginations and bring the story to life. The text is just about right for a child of about 9 years of age, though younger kids will be able to follow most of it with a little effort (though my child wasn't ready to read it on their own yet, they still enjoyed leafing through the pages and getting a sense of the story). If you're reading it as a bedtime story, there are no chapter divisions, meaning you will have to create some yourself or face the dreaded prospect of reading the whole thing in one sitting. You may wish to do that, but most of us mere mortals have had enough of a long day by 9pm and would find it preferable to read a dozen pages and finish with \"and if you want to find out what happens next, you'll have to hear the next part tomorrow night\".One small criticism is that the quality of the binding isn't as great as the rest of the product. I didn't have it long before a tear appeared along the spine on the front cover. It can be glued or taped, but a pity it's so fragile considering it's such a nice book and will get a lot of handling over the years for sure.",
