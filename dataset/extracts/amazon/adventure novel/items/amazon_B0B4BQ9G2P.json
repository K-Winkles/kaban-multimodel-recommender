        "description": "Shannon Chakraborty, the bestselling author of The City of Brass, spins a new trilogy of magic and mayhem on the high seas in this tale of pirates and sorcerers, forbidden artifacts and ancient mysteries, in one woman\u2019s determined quest to seize a final chance at glory\u2014and write her own legend.Amina al-Sirafi should be content. After a storied and scandalous career as one of the Indian Ocean\u2019s most notorious pirates, she\u2019s survived backstabbing rogues, vengeful merchant princes, several husbands, and one actual demon to retire peacefully with her family to a life of piety, motherhood, and absolutely nothing that hints of the supernatural.But when she\u2019s tracked down by the obscenely wealthy mother of a former crewman, she\u2019s offered a job no bandit could refuse: retrieve her comrade\u2019s kidnapped daughter for a kingly sum. The chance to have one last adventure with her crew, do right by an old friend, and win a fortune that will secure her family\u2019s future forever? It seems like such an obvious choice that it must be God\u2019s will.Yet the deeper Amina dives, the more it becomes alarmingly clear there\u2019s more to this job, and the girl\u2019s disappearance, than she was led to believe. For there\u2019s always risk in wanting to become a legend, to seize one last chance at glory, to savor just a bit more power\u2026and the price might be your very soul.Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.

I think I was expecting more of a historical fiction type of book, based on a true story, and I have no idea why I was thinking that. I did love the historical side of it, since I rarely read books about that part of the world. I loved learning a bit about new countries and cultures and people, and I'm intrigued enough to read more if future books are forthcoming. Amina is a badA and I would love to have more adventures with her and see how she eventually settles her debt.",

                "reviewText": "Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi is an entertaining sea adventure-historical-fantasy of a woman pirate sailing the Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean in the 12th century. This is the world of Sinbad the Sailor, of Ibn Battuta, of Oman\u2019s beautiful rich naval history of seafaring dhows. Amina is also awesome! She is no plucky sassy teenage girl (the overdone protagonist of choice in this genre), but rather, she is 40-something swashbuckling pirate comfortable with herself and confident in her own abilities.The story is funny and adventurous, and moves at a great pace. The only negative that I would say is that writer (who also does this with her City of Brass series) likes to insert contemporary social/political commentary in her work. I agree with her politics (I can tell that she is quite progressive) so it is not a criticism of her political beliefs themselves, but rather the way they are presented. It is sometimes quite jarring to have modern developed political thoughts and commentary about the vagaries of the \"rich folk\" jump out of a rich tapestry of medieval Islamic and maritime fantasy. It's not that people of that time weren't political, but the way it is presented is not very organic.I am just so grateful to see this time and place represented and finally, a mature adult female voice enjoying herself in adventure story that's not all Kate Chopin and Sylvia Plath, or some YA fantasy romance that happens to take place in a vague historical setting. It is very clear to me that the author did a lot of research to craft this world.",

It is the story of a female pirate on the Indian Ocean. She and her crew set out to rescue a kidnapped girl. However, things are not as they seem, and they end up dealing with dark magic and magical creatures. This fantasy adventure story was quite the ride!The cast of characters is full of misfits and unusual skills. I enjoyed meeting them and seeing them as the family they are. This book was well written and full of exciting scenes. I did find it a challenging read because of the unknown language used and little prior background knowledge of the time, place, and religion. But if you are looking for a fantasy full of adventure, this is a good one!",

                "reviewText": "Amina \u00e4r en v\u00e4ldigt bra start in i fantasy f\u00f6r er som precis som jag nyligen b\u00f6rjade l\u00e4sa igen i vuxen \u00e5lder. Charakt\u00e4rerna \u00e4r trov\u00e4rdiga och roliga att l\u00e4sa, man vill veta mer och mer om dem ju mer man l\u00e4ser men den som tar showen \u00e4r verkligen huvudkarakt\u00e4ren Amina som man f\u00f6ljer i en fisrt person perspektiv.Om ni \u00e4r intresserade av en crew av karakt\u00e4rer som \u00e4r mycket \u00e4ldre och faktiskt visar sin \u00e5lder \u00e4r boken perfekt. Att l\u00e4sa om en moder och se hennes perspektiv p\u00e5 v\u00e4rlden var n\u00e5got jag verkligen gillade och hur hbtq+ karakt\u00e4rerna v\u00e4vdes in utan problem var ocks\u00e5 ett stort plus.Boken utspelar sig i en intressant del av v\u00e4rlden som man oftast inte l\u00e4ser om i fantasy vilket k\u00e4ndes v\u00e4ldigt fresh.F\u00f6r att summera s\u00e5 rekommenderar jag starkt denna boken till alla som vill l\u00e4sa om en stark \u00e4ldre kvinnlig karakt\u00e4r i en bit av v\u00e4rlden man ofta inte l\u00e4ser om i fantasy som f\u00e5r g\u00e5 igen pr\u00f6vningar i b\u00e5de moderskap och sin tro.",

                "reviewText": "Eigentlich hat Aminal Al-Sirafi sich aus dem Dasein als Piratin zur\u00fcckgezogen und zieht jetzt ihre Tochter gro\u00df. Doch dann bekommt sie einen Auftrag, den sie gleich aus mehreren Gr\u00fcnden nicht ablehnen kann. Sie trommelt (nicht ganz ohne Schwieriegkeiten) ihre ehemaligen Kameraden zusammen und sie machen sich auf in ein Abenteuer, das gr\u00f6\u00dfer, aufregender und vielschichtiger ist, als sie es sich zun\u00e4chst vorstellen k\u00f6nnen.Ich mochte, dass die Hauptcharaktere alle ein erwachsenes Leben f\u00fchrten, das zumindest bei Amina auch deutlich in ihre Queste hineinspielt. Das Abenteuer an sich enth\u00e4lt St\u00fcrme, Monster, fiese B\u00f6sewichte und nicht ganz so fiese Piraten, also alles, was zu einer Piratengeschichte geh\u00f6rt. Das Setting ist angeleht an das Leben der Menschen im Mittelalter um den Indischen Ozean, die fantastischen Wesen, die nat\u00fcrlich auch vorkommen, entstammen der islamischen Mythologie.",
