A bit of caution is needed when reading aloud in just a few spots to edit out or modify words and descriptions, especially for children under 13. The rich vocabulary and choice of phrasing overall makes for a very satisfying story. Just as much can be learned from the boys indiscretions as their noble behavior, which makes for good family conversations. Highly recommended!",

For today's kids, I would suggest getting an audio version to go with it to help with the large amounts of colloquialisms throughout the entire book. It found my kids had difficulty relating and understanding the dialogue because they don't experience this kind of talk, unlike many of us did in our childhood or with our parents/grandparents. Listening to it while reading helped immensely and kept them moving along.",

The fence whitewashing incident is of course famous and justly so. The description of Tom and Becky's relationship, the three boys running away and being thought dead by the townspeople (and attending their own funeral), Tom and Huck witnessing the murder of the doctor and later attending the trial of a man falsely accused of the murder . . . the thoughts of the characters as they undergo these adventures are impeccably described.
