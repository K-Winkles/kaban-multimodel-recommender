No slowdowns in this compelling series of how I often percieved our old American West was finally settled!Some of the most endearing storylines I've have the opportunity to follow, as Jubal, and his small posse, takes care of business in an appropriate manner! Too, the characters were appropriately selected in their respective roles! These guys always take their respective assignments with one objective in sight: Get the bad guys at all costs!Most importantly, I, without hesitation, recommend this Jubal story to everyone, as I was unable to put the book aside until the last bad guy was accounted for! I look forward to the next story of my favorite U. S. Marshal, and his associates!!!\ud83d\ude03",

I've been a Casey Nash fan for some time now. I haven't read all his books, but I plan to. His Jubal Stone series is my favorite. This is his latest and could well be his best yet, and that is saying something. J. W. Masterson, his co-writer, is new to me, but if this novel is a good representation of his writing, he will sell a whole lot of Pharaoh Smith novels. There is an excerpt from the first Pharaoh Smith novel at the end of this story. I plan to buy the novel as soon as it becomes available.",
