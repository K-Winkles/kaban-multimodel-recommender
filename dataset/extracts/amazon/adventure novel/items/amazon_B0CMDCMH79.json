Too, there are no slowdowns throughout this exhilarating series of ongoing excitement that will appease anyone's desired expectations from beginning to end! Too, the Author, once again, goes above and beyond in creating the most innovative characters throughout the entire series of unending excitement! No slowdowns throughout the entire series of compelling, lifelike, adventures!Never read a Shorty Thompson story that wasn't five stars worthy, and if possible, this one needs to a step or two above that! Definitely recommend it to all readers, regardless of your normal reading selections, as I found it impossible to put the story aside until the final episode had been accomplished! Just doesn't get any better than this exhilarating series of realistic old American western folklore excitement!!!\ud83d\ude03",
