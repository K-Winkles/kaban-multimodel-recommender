                "reviewText": "I've noticed interactive fiction is making a comeback and with digital readers, these \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" style books have a lot of potential. I came across Daniel Heck's Seal of Thomerion and gave it a read. I have a hard copy of this and read it on digital. The writing is solid and the decisions are well laid out. The writer starts the book by explaining that there are multiple endings and even has a page where you can write down key words that you will use to determine decisions later in the book. This is a unique spin on the classic Choose Your Own Adventures, which played out more like a maze with dead ends and felt more like a game than a story.The Seal of Thomerion is more advanced as a story, as if the teenage CYOA books needed an upgrade into a mature book with the same concept. This book pulls it off quite well, and is an interesting enough quest that even after I came to an end, I wanted to start over. It's hard to critique a book when you've read one story within a dozen, but if you pick up this book and want a good interactive story, you won't be disappointed, even if you don't end up with the best outcome of the book. I imagine you can read this book a dozen times and grow frustrated wondering how to do it right.Lastly, though I didn't end up on the path that would allow me to play, there's a card game somewhere within the book. This is an amazing accomplishment for interactive fiction.Strongly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent gamebook that is written very well and has an interesting story. You don't use dice (I love dice) but you get many meaningful options to choose from, which often lead to completely different story lines (or certain death). This is great as I got to reread the story several times, each time going to completely different places and meeting different people. In fact, you really should reread the book as this will explain more of the world and the reasons behind what's happening. The book also always offers you to go back to your last decision point if you reach a dead end, so you don't have to start from the beginning if you don't want to. Needing no dice also means that this is an ideal book to read in places where using dice would be difficult (like in bed), which means more gamebook-reading opportunities! I thoroughly recommend this gamebook and I will now read the next one in the series.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this paperback version as a present for my husband, who on receipt was massively excited to read a CYOA for adults having loved the book style as a teenager. However, he's about 3 choices in to his first read through and already facing an extremely annoying error... neither of the choices given follow on from the story arc he was reading...!! Pretty obvious from the narrative mentioning a whole group of people (no group formed yet), character names he's never come across, and different locations / objects than were the focus of the choice he was making. I've had a glance, and it appears one page very early in the book has accidentally run over by one line onto a 2nd page. Maybe a change of printing font/size/format for this edition? But either way, it has pushed all the pages at least one further than where you are told to skip to.... This is not insurmountable, but certainly takes some of the flow out of reading the story. Each time there's a choice it's a case of considering whether the options are before or after the error page (which is almost entirely blank) and if after, add 1 number before turning and reading on. We've yet to discover if any similar error repeats later in the book too, otherwise the adjustment needed might even increase! The premise is good, but the publication here has been disappointing. You'd have expected a little more care in proof reading for a book where the page numbering is so vital. It has certainly left me feeling as though the gift is a bit of a dud, and puts me off buying further ones in the series.",
