        "description": "You have been called upon to serve.It is 1975. Clay is among a dozen orphaned children, selected by the British Government, for a clandestine program to craft the best spies in the world. This is the secret \u201cSea Dogs\u201d program, inspired by the historic Elizabethan Sea Dogs, who were the Queen\u2019s pirates that waged unconventional war against Her Majesty\u2019s enemies.All the children have been orphaned at the hands of Britain\u2019s global enemies of Communism and terrorism. The children are brought to train and live on the self-sufficient land of Castle Omega in the Scottish Highlands. They are tutored by WWII hero, Commander James Hammond, of British Naval Intelligence. And by his wife, Evie, who investigated murders, crimes, and espionage for Scotland Yard.Physics, wilderness survival, war games, and underwater demolition\u2014are among the many skills the children learn at Castle Omega. But above all, they are taught to kill the enemy. The children discover their purpose of exacting revenge against Britain\u2019s enemies to avenge their parents. In their years of sequestered training, the orphaned children come to see their adult tutors as their new parents, and together they form the family they all wish they still had.The Sea Dogs is just the beginning of Clay\u2019s lifelong mission for Queen, God, & Country. Welcome to Castle Omega. By joining the Sea Dogs program, you hereby swear your life to secrecy. If you are ever compromised or risk the secrecy of the mission\u2014then you shall be sent to Davey Jones\u2019 Locker. And be buried at sea.\u201cI shall die a happy death\u2014knowing my secrets die with me.\u201d Read more",

                "reviewText": "For an espionage-novel, it has a very grounded, realistic, and human portrayal of all of its characters. The protagonist grows from a 12 year old boy to a teenager, learning to grapple with being an orphan, training to be a soldier, and endless physical exercises.And he is not alone. The other children, who will become not only his friends but the closest thing he has to family, also has to grapple with the same things. They are all orphans, all grow up together, and do every form of training together. They suffer and grow together.Their adult trainers are a couple who lived through WWII. And are surprisingly sweet given their not-so-small roles as to train the best spies the world has ever seen. The children are told plainly they will operate outside of the law, will have to sacrifice innocent lives if need be, will have to sacrifice each other. And will have to sacrifice themselves to maintain the program\u2019s secret if need be.This novel covers the beginnings of Clay\u2019s mission, his relationship with his team, and just how exactly the Sea Dogs program fosters the best spies in the world.5 out of 5 stars.",
