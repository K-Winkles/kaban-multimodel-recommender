J. Box.After hunting down a rogue spy as part of an elite CIA counterespionage unit, Garrett Kohl returns home to Texas in hopes of settling down and carving out a normal life.

                "reviewText": "Book Review \u2013 Ricochet \u2013 Taylor MooreAuthor Taylor Moore\u2019s Book 3 of the Garrett Kohl series, \u201cRicochet,\u201d is a refreshing modern-day western that I thoroughly enjoyed! It was a high-octane, adrenaline-fueled, action-laden thriller that I couldn\u2019t put down. Main character DEA Special Agent Garrett Kohl and his CIA black ops team embark on an off-the-books investigation with a group of outsiders to help Kohl and his team stop a group of Middle-Eastern bad guys from destroying Kohl\u2019s Texas High Plains community. Returning home to Texas in hopes of settling down and carving out a normal life and rebuilding his devastated cattle ranch, Kohl \u2013 a former US Army Green Beret - learns that some Iranians are blackmailing employees at a nearby nuclear weapons plant and were planning a devastating act of sabotage and destruction. Kohl rallies his CIA paramilitary team and a miscellaneous crew of outcasts \u2013 some of whom he once put behind bars \u2013 to take down the blackmailing extortionists and dismantle their devious operation. Intense, Powerful, and Energetic, Ricochet covers all the bases of a well-written, well-plotted, well-told action thriller. It\u2019s a C.J. Fox-like story that kept me on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend reading Taylor\u2019s two other Garrett Kohl books in the series - \u201cDown Range\u201d and \u201cFirestorm,\u201d but know that Ricochet \u2013 Book 3 \u2013 can standalone. Great addition to a splendid series. I really enjoyed this story.",

A cowboy cocktail that will light your hair on fire: mix one part adrenaline-thrill ride, one part family in crisis, one part espionage, and a dash of uranium. Shake it. Stir it. Roll it down a hill. You\u2019ve got yourself a RICOCHET.The third instalment in the Garrett Kohl saga takes things to the next level. Layered narratives that blend Kohl\u2019s personal challenges\u2014single/adopted father to Asadi, son to the cantankerous Butch, and lovelorn cowboy who just can\u2019t seem to ask the woman of his dreams to marry him\u2014with his seeming inability to not run to the sound of guns. It\u2019s simply excellent.Here is the joy in Taylor\u2019s writing. Not only is he a former practitioner who writes to his competencies, he does his research, and more to the point\u2014he writes with heart. The Kohl family saga would be worth reading on its own. Add in the high-stakes adventure (and let\u2019s face it, Garrett is a magnet for trouble) and you\u2019ve got something you\u2019re not going to be able to put down.Short version, buy a copy today and cancel your plans.",
