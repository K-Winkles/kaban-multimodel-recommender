Marty and Bo were just trying to keep their struggling startup alive\u2014but now they\u2019ve got a bigger problem\u2014keeping themselves alive.Most investor pitch meetings don\u2019t end in murder\u2014but then Marty and Bo haven\u2019t had a lot of luck lately. They\u2019ve been struggling to keep their startup business alive. It\u2019s not high-tech, it\u2019s not highly successful and the pressure to find capital has strained their bank accounts and Marty\u2019s marriage.So when Nico Scava offered to invest they eagerly accepted. He had money, connections in the art world, and a creative idea, but maybe they should have asked more questions. Now Nico\u2019s dead and they\u2019re on the hook for whatever scheme he was running. The Russian mob is after them, and if they don\u2019t find $10 million and a mysterious missing painting in the next few days they\u2019ll be dead too.Their frantic chase will lead them from a cabin in the Oregon woods to a Portland strip club, from an aging artist to a bogus baron, and deep into the history of a missing masterpiece that someone is willing to kill to obtain. As the bodies pile up, Marty and Bo will have some tough choices to make about how far they\u2019ll go to protect their families, their company, and themselves. Read more",

                "reviewText": "Chasing Money - A Captivating New Crime ThrillerMichael Balter\u2019s debut novel, Chasing Money, is a fast-paced thriller that hooked me in the first few paragraphs and reeled me in page by page. Marty and Bo, the two protagonists, are friends and business partners in a struggling startup who make the mistake of taking money from the wrong person. When Nico is murdered, the killer sends them on a desperate search for $10 million and a mysterious missing painting.What I loved about this book:- The characters are vividly portrayed and anything but stereotypical. When they had money, Bo drove race cars and Marty collected fountain pens. Now they\u2019re both struggling, and Marty\u2019s marriage is on the rocks. When the two men are thrust into danger, they react like real people, with fear, confusion and questionable choices.- The dialogue is darkly humorous and exceptionally well-written. The tone reminds of great noir crime writers like Elmore Leonard. This would make a great buddy movie.- The author has done his research - on art history, Nazi loot, forging techniques - and is intimately familiar with the challenges of raising money for a startup. He weaves fascinating vignettes into his story without slowing down the pace.- Every chapter ends with a hook that made me want to read more. The action builds to a compelling climax, and then closes with a twist that promises more Marty and Bo thrillers to come.Bonus points - the book is set in Portland, Oregon and the surrounding area. I love reading books that place in my former hometown!I highly recommend Chasing Money!!",

                "reviewText": "Marty and Bo are like a lot of start-up founders I know - incredibly optimistic about the future, at times to the point of being delusional. You have to convince yourself of what's possible before you can convince anyone else.I never thought about those character traits in the context of a high stakes thriller with guns and death, but it works really well because these founders have the entire world against them, and they have to figure out a path through. The stakes felt really high!And all the other characters along the way are fully fleshed out, the spouses and artists and brokers all have fully realized worlds and personalities even if they are only in a few scenes.This book was a fun ride, and, having lived through start-ups myself, often hit too close to home! A great read!",
