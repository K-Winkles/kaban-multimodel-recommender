I read this like four times, It's good, it IS kind of gross (who would mail someone Medusa's head in a box!?) but it is fun to read. I did NOT get turned to stone (at all). I DID get turned into a gorgon once (a gorgon is a mythical creature that has snakes for hair, a snake body, if you look at their face you will get turned to stone because they are so ugly or it's just some special power. Also, if you look at their face in a mirror you won't get turned to stone because it's not their actual face. ). I can't tell if it was a good ending or a bad ending. Anyways, this is probably my second favorite pick your own quest book. It is also maybe\u2026half educatonal? There are a lot of gods. This is a good book, and I hope it is not the last pick your own quest book.",
