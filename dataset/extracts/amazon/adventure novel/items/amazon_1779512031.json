                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Not Your Golden Age Adam Strange",
                "reviewText": "Tom King does it once again with Strange Adventures. This is yet another example of the masterful way that King can craft a story about things that many of us may experience throughout are lives, masked behind a universe that features epic space battles, gods, and superheroes. This time around King tells a split narrative, showing the brutality of war in contrast to a detective narrative where we see themes of lies, truth, and perception.Evan \u201cDoc\u201d Shaner does the art for the past narrative which focuses on Adam Strange's time on Rann fighting a war against the Pykkts. Shaner draws this in a style that evokes the golden age of comics that almost tricks the reader into believing that this is going to be the lighter hearted segment of the book. Throughout the end of the book, as more is revealed, we see Strange grow more and more cynical, and by the end he is not this happy-go-lucky superhero that we thought him to be. Shaner depicts this in narrative but also in the way he draws Strange. At the start of Shaner\u2019s portion of this book, Strange is a clean-shaven man; however, as we see him go through the trials and tribulations of war, Strange stars to grow this gnarly looking beard. The beard is symbolic of Strange becoming almost just like the \u2018savages\u2019 that he is fighting. By the end of the book, the past narrative, while looking reminiscent of the golden age, is almost more hardcore and horrifying than the present.This idea of \u2018savages\u2019 ties into the meta narrative of the idea of the \u201cwhite savior\u201d which has been present in many works of past fiction such as \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d and \u201cJohn Carter of Mars.\u201d Throughout the narrative, Strange is required to build an army made up of the natives of Rann. The Rannian royalty repeatedly refers to the other groups on the planet as \u201csavages\u201d because they are shown to live in ways that the Rannians consider unconventional. The irony here is that even though these groups are repeatedly thought of as savages, they are instrumental in the war against the Pykkts. Even after their value is proven, the Rannians still end up just using these other groups as cannon fodder, showing that the Rannians are the true savages. This flips the \u201cwhite savior\u201d narrative on its head, showing that the wealthy and \u201cmore advanced\u201d civilizations are not always the saviors that they think they are.The other narrative we see is the crime, noir narrative that Mitch Gerads draws. This takes place in the modern day and focuses mainly on the characters of Alanna Strange and Mr. Terrific. Mr. Terrific\u2019s journey mirrors that of Strange\u2019s in that he also had gone through a traumatic instance in his life and has never really come to terms with it. Terrific never dealt with the death of his wife and daughter and instead had convinced himself that he never wanted a daughter in the first place, and then buried himself in super heroics and science. Terrific\u2019s journey in this story is learning from the mistakes of Strange and learning to move past the lies he has told himself, in ways that Strange never could.This mirrors Alanna\u2019s story, who has basically dedicated her life to her husband. She has almost become a shell of a person since the death of her daughter and has overlooked many of the horrible things that her and her husband have done because of that. It is revealed later in the store that Strange had faked his daughter\u2019s death in a deal with the Pykkts so that Rannians would look like they won the war, with Strange instead aiming the Pykkts at earth. It is revealed that instead of being the hero of two worlds, Strange is the destroyer of two worlds. These revelations shape Alanna into a headstrong character that by the end strives to be the hero that everyone (including herself) thought her husband to be.In Gerads\u2019s sections, the story, like many of his other works with King, becomes very interpretive. Gerads has a very impressive way of making characters appear in a way you may expect, while the story is going in a very different direction. The first two-thirds of the story often leads you to believe that Alanna has villainous motives, with Gerads depicting her as a heavy smoker, almost in a fem fetal role, while she avidly fights against the Justice League\u2019s accusations of her husband. She is shown making poor deals with political figures, and in essence \u201cdrinking the Kool-Aid\u201d of her husband\u2019s load of lies. By the end we see that Alanna was being manipulated by Strange but in a way that he felt was justifiable. Gerads makes sure to present Alanna as headstrong but flawed. More so than any character in Strange Adventures, Gerads chooses to always position Alanna in ways that make her motives ambiguous.Strange Adventures is a tale of truth, lies, and perception. With the backdrop of a superhuman epic, King, Gerads, and Shaner tell a fantastic story of what can happen when we refuse to deal with our past, and instead lie out way to the top. There are shades of the strong opinions that became so strongly formed in a 2021 Post-Trump political society, as well as the publics inability to see beyond bias; however, at the end of the day, Strange Adventures is about truth always coming out, and the toll that a traumatic event can take on people\u2019s lives.",

                "reviewText": "Strange Adventures (2021) by Tom King, Mitch Gerads and Evan Shaner (DC)King tackles another long-standing relatively unsung DC character and deconstructs them for a modern audience. It\u2019s another DC \u201cBlack Label\u201d project (similar to Elseworlds) which tends to exist outside normal DC continuity. My previous exposure to Adam Strange was mostly limited to the 2004 series by Andy Diggle & Pascal Ferry (4.8 on Amazon).While some readers may already have strong feelings about Tom King or even Adam Strange, regardless, Strange Adventures deserves recognition as a masterful venture within the genre. The series showed up on the \u201cbest of\u201d lists for the Washington Post, Variety, and Entertainment Weekly. It received 2021 Eisner nominations for \u201cBest Limited Series\u201d and \u201cBest Penciler/inker\u201d. It was also nominated for the 2022 Hugo Award for \u201cBest Graphic Story or Comic\u201d. It received a 4.2 on Goodreads, 4.7 on Amazon, and 8.3 Critic Rating on Comic Book Round Up.To quote one of the main characters (Alanna Strange), \u201cIt\u2019s a grand space opera about a hero thrown into a faraway land and he marries a princess and he leads the natives and he wins the war\u201d\u2026(or is it?)King does a spectacular job with the pacing and climax of the series. I particularly enjoyed his portrayal and use of Mr. Terrific.It was a skillful decision on the different use of artists Gerads and Shaner for the modern story and flashbacks. The book is beautiful. I also appreciated both the quality of the hardcover and the simple incorporation of the story elements as Adam\u2019s memoir into its design.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",

                "reviewText": "This was a beautiful and fascinating book, but the story is one that sort of writes itself. The whole time, I was thinking, \u201cOkay, so a hero of the \u2018old school\u2019 who seems virtuous, whom everyone admires and seems to exemplify traditional virtues. There\u2019s only one way this is going to go\u2014he\u2019ll turn out to be a total hypocrite and monster.\u201dIt would have been more interesting if (spoilers) I was proved wrong. I wasn\u2019t, of course.Throughout this book, little pot-shots are taken at the Trump administration\u2014places where Adam Strange is painted as a kind of Trump Lite (albeit better-looking and more decent). But what writers of this type of narrative usually don\u2019t realize is that these sorts of stories are precisely why we got Trump.Because when you train people to be cynical, to assume that every traditionally virtuous man is (in actual fact) toxic and, essentially, putting on an act\u2014and your political opponents come to believe you, at least about national figures, what is left? I\u2019ll tell you\u2014mere thirst for power and hatred for political enemies, without any insistence whatever that your own heroes adhere to any standards besides pure partisanship.The only truly revolutionary story right now would be the one that causes us to believe in heroes again.I think an argument could be made (against mine) that this is a tragedy. But that\u2019s not quite right. While it is about the fall of someone who was once a good man (?), his past goodness (if it existed) is overshadowed by his present hypocrisy. There is nothing interesting about his goodness\u2014nothing compelling about it. A real tragedy is a good man who is destroyed by some sort of flaw, so that we identify with him and feel something has really been lost. But there is nothing terribly good about Adam Strange to begin with. He\u2019s Willy Loman, not Oedipus.The art is beautiful.",
