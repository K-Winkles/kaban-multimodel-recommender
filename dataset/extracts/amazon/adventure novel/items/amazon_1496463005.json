Once you pick up this book, it is nearly impossible to put down. I read in one sitting; this book is so enthralling and unique. The way that Liz and Jack Hagler accurately depict the Bible stories in a fun and exciting way is legendary! I love how the story transitions from Patrick's life to his adventures in the Bible, and relates the two in a way that makes you think more in-depth about the stories and how they can have an impact on your life. Every aspect of his journey is told in a hilarious fashion that keeps you laughing along the whole plot. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fantastic adventure book, or who is looking to learn more about God's Word in a new and exciting way!",
