        "description": "International #1 Amazon Bestseller in SEVEN Categories in the US and CA, including Weather, Commercial Aviation, Piloting & Flight Instruction in the US. Pacific Northwest, Commercial Aviation, Pacific Northwest United States History, and Pacific West Travel in CA.Five Hundred Feet Above Alaska is the story of Peter Connors, a young man who moves to Alaska in pursuit of his dream of becoming a commercial pilot. While the pilots in Alaska are known for their superior airmanship, they are also famous for their disregard of the rules that govern them. Determined to ultimately be an airline pilot in \u201cthe lower forty-eight,\u201d Peter vows to walk the straight and narrow. Yet, when Peter is the only pilot available to rescue a comrade who crashed in the snow-covered tundra, he is forced to compromise the very ethics that define him. Over time, Peter\u2019s competence begins to overpower his regard for the rules. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, Peter begins a downward spiral. The life Peter had carefully constructed for himself is at odds with the \u201clive or die\u201d flying of Alaska. Over the course of a year of doing battle with the elements on a daily basis, armed only with his plane, his wits and his skill to bring him home every night, Peter must decide whether it is more important to embrace life or cheat death.",

I was left with a real sense of the thrills and dangers of being a bush pilot in Alaska.You really feel like you know the characters in the book. They would be your neighbors or your friends - if you lived in Anaktuvuk Pass or Unalakleet. Ironically, they seem more genuine than the reality TV stars on Ice Road Truckers or Alaskan Bush People.I've been to Alaska several times on vacation, but, after reading this book, I felt like I lived there. You can really sense the stunning natural beauty of Alaska's wilderness combined with the grittiness of daily life in the villages there.",

                "reviewText": "In this novel, Mr. Brantner truly succeeds at transporting the reader right into the cockpit of the Cessna 207 used to support so many critical parts of every day life in Alaska. It delivers on a very accurate depiction of all of the decisions, considerations, and perspectives a pilot must make and have, sometimes in a split second as countless variables change over the course of even a short ten minute flight.The main characters are instantly credible and comfortable, and the plot twists they must come to terms with as they come to terms with sacrifices of a bush pilot's life keep the reader interested and constantly engaged.This is a great story, and worth putting in your reading queue.",

                "reviewText": "This book started out great. I spent a lot of time in Alaska, mostly as a fisherman, but I also had my own Stinson 108-2. I was one of those pilots that the author described as flying in the bush, but not being a bush pilot. If it matters, I am 74 years of age. The last half of the book was so focused on romance, that I had to push my way through it. I have friends who are commercial pilots and I was ready to recommend it, but I won\u2019t. What I\u2019m saying has nothing to do with the quality of your writing, it has to do with the change from flying as a bush pilot and learning in Alaska, to getting married and having a kid.",

Having flown the Twin Otter out of Bethel 40 years ago, I was amazed at the author\u2019s ability to put me back in the cockpit. The book details the human factors and huge pressure to compromise. Most pilots arrive in Alaska with the desire to be legal and safe. But even today, for most bush operators, there strong culture of non-compliance. The \u201crogue\u201d pilot is still an inappropriate role model. \u201cAirplanes fly over gross but they don\u2019t fly out of gas. And the published minimums are for the new guy.\u201d This book is a must read for pilots who cherish life and seek wisdom.",

This was an interesting read about a guy that got a last minute job to be a pilot in Alaska after flying tour groups in the Grand Canyon previously. Nobody expected him to be a good pilot and people; especially his immediate boss, was very surprised how good he was and what he did for him when the boss was in trouble on his flight. It was a good read and I enjoyed the story about his girlfriend also. This was a very straight laced person who wound up fitting in just fine.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re hoping for a book about tough Alaskan pioneering spirit and derring-do, you\u2019ll be bitterly disappointed in this mundane tale of a pious young man plying his trade as an aerial taxi driver. Na\u00efve & inexperienced in matters of the opposite sex, our hero\u2019s first challenge is to overcome the distrust of his gruff pilot instructor, but wins him over by coming to his aid in a tight spot during a snow storm. This initiates a true bromance in which the grizzled old aviator takes him under his wing and teaches him how to talk to girls. But just in case temptation proves his undoing, he becomes a local pastor as well. He finally plucks up courage to find the girl of his dreams, a sassy young thing who is undoubtedly more experienced, but who secretly worships him and thinks he is the bestest pilot everrrr! The dialogue is tediously cringeworthy throughout the first half of the book, which is as far as I was prepared to read. If it wasn\u2019t on my kindle, it would have ended up in my wood burning stove.",
