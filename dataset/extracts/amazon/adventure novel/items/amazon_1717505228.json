I decided to go with an author who\u2019s been writing many of the pick your own adventure books. A series of books both the county librarian and the school librarian suggested for him to read with his advanced reading levels since he\u2019s only six. He\u2019s read probably all the versions at least twenty times already only having this book a month or so. It holds his interests because there are options AND it\u2019s Minecraft! She wrote three! So when I can get some more money I want to buy him the other two for him to enjoy reading since reading can be hard for him being so young, but being so advanced. How can you find that perfect balance of the right content for someone so young and with so many challenges to go through a short attention span. So this book is just a perfect option for that sort of kid. I\u2019m really glad I got this one. And I can\u2019t wait to get the other two for him. And eventually more pick your own adventures for him to enjoy beyond Minecraft.",

First the wolf, they don't attack any mob unless it or its owner is provoked, besides skeletons of course. Also there are giraffes, elephants, and some food. But it DOES say that \"you have never seen this is Minecraft before.\" Which alright. 2: grammar & spelling. I wouldn't say \"poorly\" written but there are some grammatical and spelling errors, but its fin. Now that I've explained why its not perfect, you may think its a bad idea to get it, but get it its good",

After a little wobble following our first \u2018bad ending\u2019 we really got into this book and we\u2019ve been back to work out how to get to every ending. He\u2019s actually suggested reading and been keen to find out what happens next. The relatively short sections make reading in short bursts possible.
