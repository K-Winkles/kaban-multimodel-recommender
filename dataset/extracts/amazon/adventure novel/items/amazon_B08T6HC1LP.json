                "reviewText": "With two excellent series behind him (\"Mahu and \"Have Body, Will Guard\") Neil Plakcy could be forgiven if he came up with a bit of a miss when he tackles historical fiction for the first time.But Plakcy is dependable in so many ways that it's only a few pages into this one that you realize we have another two totally opposite, yet completely compatible, MCs to entrance us.That he manages to do it while immersing us in a perfect Victorian England setting with all its social complexities and foibles laid bare for our entertainment--and disgust--is all the more remarkable.In Lord Magnus Dawson (on the cover, woof!) and the commoner Toby Marsh Plakcy has given us a perfectly wonderful pairing who have their pride and prejudice issues but also pent up desires to find the right man.That they come together as Lord and valet in a mystery that is not as complicated as it seems but still neatly laid out and done over, is an achievement that may have floundered in the hands of a less experienced author.This one has the seedlings of a series, but even if it doesn't turn out that way it's another pleasant ride for Plakcy fans and a must read for those who have not had the pleasure of his craft as yet.",

It has intrigue, secrets, a murder, and also sexy bits. My only critique: I didn\u2019t feel the romantic connection between the MCs, so when the \u201cI\u2019m so in love\u201d scene appeared, it felt a little abrupt. Their connection felt more like lust than love. Overall, solid storytelling and a likable read.",

                "reviewText": "M/M fiction has mostly fallen into a rut lately, but I found The Gentleman and the Spy to show much more originality than I've sadly grown used to. One of the giveaways that I would enjoy this book was that the plot of the mystery was destined to peak earlier than is usual, which is a good sign, because it shows that the book has created interesting characters the writer is not willing to let go of in a curt, facile, one-line wrap up. Indeed, the whodonit part of the story is a little clunky, while still entertaining. But it is later that I began to develop a fondness for many of the players, and not just the two main men. I certainly hope that the book is setting us up for further adventures of Magnus and Toby.The one thing that made me squirm at regular intervals was the use of the word \"homosexual.\" I never actually picked an exact date for the book's setting, but this word did not enter even the scientific world in England until the first decade of the 20th century, and it would be far later that it would find it's way into conversational use. Such care was used in choosing other marvelous words:\"Toby rested his wet umbrella in the majolica stand by the door...\" that this one fell clumsily amidst the gifts.",

The romance was lovely, but also integral to the plot. I do hope the author will consider putting Toby and Magnus in more adventures together! Definitely Recommended!",

I finished it, so that's an automatic 3 star rating for me, but it was too prosaic, and the plot was more interesting than the romance and the ending made no sense at all. Disappointing.",

Neil Plakcy creates a vivid Victorian era murder mystery, introducing us to another pair of interesting and well-drawn heroes -- Magnus and Toby. Bringing opposites together is a Plakcy specialty and these two are certainly an intriguing pair. I look forward to seeing more of these two and how they navigate the social structure of Victorian England as a same-sex partnership.",

They fall in love but can Victorian society ever accept their relationship? There is a crime, an arrest and a case to solve. There are also financial restraints.

                "reviewText": "I enjoyed this romp, mainly for the characterizations and period descriptions. The characters are well drawn and not one dimensional. I dropped a star for the too pat ending/solution and for the mystery being a little too easy to solve. However, as a first book in this series, I was pleased and have high hopes for any sequels.",

I enjoyed both Toby and Magnus as well as the minor characters. I thought Plakcy dealt with Toby's character extremely well especially when writing about his trauma. Magnus was lovely too, he grew on me. I look forward to the author's other books.",

The perpetrator was fairly well telegraphed, the two MC's fell in insta-love quite quickly, and there were several errors, not just grammatical, together with some pretty dreadful formatting...just take a look at the cast of characters for example. Won't be bothering with Mr Plakcy again I'm afraid \ud83d\ude15.",
