The first installment introduced us to Scaredly Squirrel who is as neurotic as the name implies but still manages to find some friends. This second title is all about their adventures. It shows Scaredly being their whole self and the friends who care and love them. Even though this is what I saw, the actual story is just cute and fluffy. Nothing overt, but that's what I love about it. It's perfect.",
