The story line was real, but the author took some liberties to make it a work of fiction. The only complaint I have about this book is editing. The pilot of a B25 does not fly with egg on his hands. He flies using a YOKE not a yolk. Similarly, you put a bomb down a CHUTE not a shoot.Of course, I'm an Old Fart from the Old School and I've been reading books about WWII since I could read.",

Roger Mehle was a naval hero; his name was not Mealy. Flight controls are on yokes, not yolks. Nobody in the 1940\u2019s said EMCON - they barely knew what radar was. And nobody - nobody - who knew Bill Halsey called him Bull - a nickname from the press that Halsey despised - except Douglas MacArthur. These avoidable errors keep me from giving five stars, because Mr. Cook\u2019s book are enjoyable, readable, and written with great admiration for the Big E and the men who sailed on her. It\u2019s just a shame that with a little care, these errors could be avoided.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Another installment of an historical fiction of the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (CV-6) in World War Two",
                "reviewText": "Mr. Cook continues his telling of the story of the USN aircraft carrier ENTERPRISE. The ship is an icon for the courage and tenacity of the ships and members of the US Navy during WWII. It reads very easily and does tell the reader the story of the ship and places it in the correct chronology for the events it participated in. The story of this ship was recorded in the absolutely excellent \"The Big E\" written by Edward Stafford in the late 1950s, Stafford having been a crew member. It was a bestseller then and continues to sell very well today, 50+ years later. If you want to read THE history this ship in one volume, then find Stafford's book and do so, but you may have to truly look very diligently for the book, as it sells that well. Scott Cook humanizes the story by adding more characters to the events. Many of the actual people are among his groupings, with fictional characters to humanize the story and make it perhaps easier on the casual historian and present generation readers. He slightly manipulates the history a bit, speeding up times and adding dialog that is fictional but tries to stick to the telling of this historical fiction as accurately as he can yet still present his ideas as author. He does NOT alter history or events overall, however there are some anachronisms that creep into each of the volumes I have read that show the author has knowledge of modern naval aviation, but he allows the modernity to make some gaffes that really bother me and other readers I have chatted with who know a bit more about the wartime naval and aviation techniques and situations. Sure his methods do get the story published so as to interest a modern reader who grew up gazing at a monitor and is not a book reader, and show them the history they perhaps missed in their schooling, but the anachronisms do give a false sense of what was really taking place in flying an aircraft to war in the 1940s and operations on a US Navy ship. In a sense, that's \"flawed-history\" that the reader is being exposed to. Being a retired history educator and military/aviation history \"junkie\" those errors really bother me. Simple examples: Cook has WWII Navy pilots talking about having to \"punch-out\" of fatally damaged aircraft. Nope. The term was coined for the use of ejection seats. WWII era US Navy a/c did not have ejection seat technology. Or: Pilots in 1942, taking off advance throttles to get a blasting flame out of the tails of their a/c. Nope. The Navy did not have jet engines on carrier a/c until 1945 (testing) and 1946-47 for beginning of jet operations. Stuff like that and way too many more to please me. The publishers/editors ought to also invest in a proof reader or two before the book goes to press. Such editing ought to be easier than it used to be with computer generated printing procedures. Perhaps a proof reader for historical context would help also ! Oh, and images on the covers are of a/c composites that look....odd, for lack of a better word ! That could be improved upon also. This comes out as a hard and negative review. Nope. I like the book series and the overall success of the stories related and look forward to the rest of the ENTERPRISE stories. The fiction part is good where intended. But the fictional part of the historical events is too often unintentionally too fictional due to errors that could have been avoided. I hope to see future volumes incorporating some improvements.",
