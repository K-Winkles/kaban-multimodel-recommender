Griffin put so much thought into this one and you could tell how much the others were enjoying it too.My favorite part was the seven years going by inside the bubble while they watched from the outside. It was so sweet. And it didn't happen when I was listening to the podcast but reading the part when Magnus was talking about Julia near the end, I couldn't stop crying. His sweet face and his sadness hit me so hard. And Kravitz! The whole time I was thinking but they died a bunch of times, they're definitely in trouble with kravitz now and I was right hahaThe cliffhanger at the end had me speechless btw. This story is so complex, I can't wait to find out what is really going on. I'm just sad it's going to take a while until the next graphic novel since it's only coming out in 2024.Truly, truly an awesome graphic novel, the art continues to blow me away in each volume and the adaptation from the original story is so well done.",

                "reviewText": "You know my love of The Adventure Zone and its Balance arc, and as a result, my enjoyment of the graphic novel adaptations to date. But The Eleventh Hour had a high bar to clear even beyond that - this was by far my favorite chapter of the campaign, full of some of the best characterization but also the richest storytelling of the entire campaign. So it\u2019s a pleasure to say that, by and large, this adaptation does what an adaptation should - it takes the material and adapts it, weaving in flashbacks and new material, thinking about story beats that were yet to come and integrating them smoothly, and finding ways to embrace the comic book format more than the series has ever done, doing things that could never be done in any other medium. For all of that, there are still the same issues that have dogged the series recently, most notably Pietsch\u2019s mixed bag of art - I can\u2019t imagine anyone else nailing the characters and the \u201cvibe\u201d of the series so well, but some of the big action sequences are all but indecipherable, and some major reveals and splash moments only really felt clear to me because I knew the context from the podcast. Similarly, there are a few adaptation choices that I can\u2019t help but feel leave some notable scar tissue; of course, I can\u2019t read it as a newcomer to the series, but there are gaps here that just feel like key information is being elided out that would make the book less accessible for newcomers. All of which brings me to the question of how to rate this. As an labor of love for fans, it\u2019s really solid; while there are art shortcomings, the story works as well as ever - even better, in some ways - and the changes here are smart and thoughtful ones. I have some concerns about how well it works on its own\u2026but given that I\u2019m firmly in the \u201cfanboy\u201d category, I have to rate it as such.",

It\u2019s one stunning page of art after another with all the charm, beauty, and humor of the previous 4 adventures. The adaptation of the story is a little reworked around the middle, but if anything they\u2019ve tightened up story beats, made it all the more emotional, and kept in all the best goofs (and added some new ones!) I highly recommend this book to anyone keeping up with the TAZ graphic novels or who just love D&D or the original podcast. This is one of my favorite arcs from the original show and Carey, Clint, and the boys absolutely do it justice! I\u2019ll be rereading it until the next one comes out!",

Are a few things truncated or cut out? Yeah and the book is still pretty big so that's understandable. The character designs are great (I loved how Istus looked, she was so divine!) and the way they're carefully building up with flashbacks (Merle leaving his family was really sad in a way it wasn't quite in the podcast imo) and I get excited every time the red coat shows up (the reveal is so soon!). Can't wait for the next book, I love this series.",

                "reviewText": "What a beautiful adaptation!! Carey's art once again knocked it out of the park, and her environments were absolutely stunning. The Eleventh Hour is one of my favorite arcs, but also one of the most difficult to comprehend, so kudos to the McElroys and Carey for adapting it! There is such an attention to detail, and the added moments gives the characters more depth and complexity. As a huge fan of the podcast, I will absolutely be buying every TAZ book.SPOILERS: Loved the adaptation of Griffin's puzzles in the mining tunnel to a hundred traps and challenges! Made the endless deaths of the main trio so much more chilling and real. Also, the first clock tower explosion was PHENOMENALLY done. Fantastic storytelling, haunting expressions, and beautiful art. Absolute chills.My only small critique is that some of the more action-heavy scenes, like the underground tunnels with June and Issac or the Purple Worm, were a little difficult to comprehend - but I remember having some difficulty fully grasping the scenes while listening to the podcast too. I think it could've benefited from a bit more visual clarity in the story-telling during the more dense scenes. But overall, an incredible job translating a complex open-world story to the graphic novel format!!",

Absolutely a 10/10, would recommend to all of my friends who enjoyed the original podcast.Due to being a paperback, I feel it could have been packaged a little more carefully as the cover arrived damaged along the top in two places. The envelope it was in was very loose and didn't offer much protection. The damage continues into the first several pages of the book; overall very minimal, but still worth mentioning.",

These Dungeon and Dragons comics are my favourite and still can't wait till the next one. The books are also of great quality and there is just nothing wrong with it. The only problem I got is a little crack in the spine of the book, this isn't a problem but wasn't going to say nothing. So the product is a 10/10 but maybe the packaging/delivery a bit more subtle, just with a tiny kiss.",
