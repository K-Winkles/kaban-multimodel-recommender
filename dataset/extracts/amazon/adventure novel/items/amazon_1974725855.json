                "reviewText": "Finally, a worthy edition of this underrated classic Pok\u00e9mon manga! This series - at least the first few volumes - hold a very special place in my nostalgic heart.Following the adventures of Red, Blue, and Green in this series is a delight, encompassing a world of wonder, companionship, and surprisingly, some moral gray areas for characters to explore. This series is a true companion to the mainline Pok\u00e9mon games, fully fleshing out a story that makes sense, in the most realistic possible way a cute, monster-infested world could be. The characters and storyline are developed in a much more mature and cohesive manner than that of its juggernaut anime counterpart, or even the stories that reside in the games storylines. For Pok\u00e9mon, this is the end-all, be-all of Pok\u00e9mon stories and the only Pok\u00e9mon series\u2019s that even come anywhere within the domain of \u2018Adventures\u2019 creativity or level of world-building that come close are the spin-off shorts series, \u2018Pok\u00e9mon: Origins,\u2019 \u2018Pok\u00e9mon: Generations,\u2019 and the recent on-going \u2018Pok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings.\u2019For someone who has been following the Pok\u00e9mon franchise since the moment I could insert a Pok\u00e9mon cartridge in a GameBoy (which, by the way, was \u2018Pok\u00e9mon: Silver\u2018 from the GameBoy Color on Christmas of 1999), I have never ever come up by another Pok\u00e9mon series as rewarding as this one.There are through-line stories that weave and interconnect, with changing main characters - just as you would be forced into a new avatar in a new installment of Pok\u00e9mon on your GameBoy, GB Color, GB Advanced, and so on, that would make, for the most part logical sense. At the same time, these characters receive a full storyline to follow and connections are made by the emphasis of companionship in this series - nearly all of these Pok\u00e9mon trainers spend thorough amounts of time letting (all?) their Pok\u00e9mon roam around free, interacting with their good and evil human counterparts around them. The abilities of the Pok\u00e9mon have real-world consequences too, as evil, brutish Pok\u00e9mon really do attack people (and conversely, evil people attack people and Pok\u00e9mon alike). At one point or another a Pok\u00e9mon or person may even be fatally or mortally wounded, which adds to the realism of monsters duking it out with fire, electricity, ice, and other dangerous abilities.The artwork enhances the simplistic magic that laces this world and it really helps that in nearly every chapter a Pok\u00e9mon can be utterly hilarious, downright scary, unbelievably threatening, mischievous, good-hearted, and so on. The Pok\u00e9mon all around are given real personalities, and they aren\u2019t merely dangerous monster pets that can be tamed and kept in a ball - they\u2019re just so much more than that here.Needless to say, there\u2019s a whole lot going on for this series and it couldn\u2019t be recommended enough for any Pok\u00e9mon fan. It\u2019s a genuinely good read.On to the *product*Pok\u00e9mon - Adventures - Collector\u2019s Edition is something interesting. It\u2019s near perfect for what it\u2019s trying to accomplish, and I )for the most part) have to give props to Viz Media for this. This edition aims to be a value-bound product but doesn\u2019t skimp out on making this also a quality product as well. at three collected volumes, this first collected volume compiles a meaty 640 pages, and in doing so collects the whole first story arc.This new edition could be compared favorably between the 3-in-1 collections that have plagued many series and is more akin to the VizBig editions of old. The difference mainly lies in the size. These are taller than the standard Tankouban volumes (the same as your average single-volume manga or the 3-in-1) and shorter than the VizBig - they\u2019re somewhere in between (I think potentially around the same size as the Death Note: Black Editions - I don\u2019t have those, but I know I should). Regardless, it\u2019s a pretty generous size.The dust jacket surprised me with its quality. It\u2019s solid, somewhat matte-feel finish makes this book easy and welcome to hold, and the print, from the lettering to the artwork is embossed in a glossy finish that makes it \u2018pop\u2019 just right on your shelf.To be honest, I was expecting this release to be all-around budget cheap, my expectations were much closer to the 3-in-1 collections, and we all know how terrible those are. But the paper quality is much closer, again, to that of the VizBig editions, and while none of the paper is not quite as thick as that, it doesn\u2019t feel cheap, you won\u2019t be able to see trough to the next page almost ever unless you really try - which is pretty nice. Additionally inside, you\u2019ll find some colored pages - not many, only 7 - but it is a nice addition none the less. My only gripe here is, of course, there could have been more, but I imagine the base price would have gone up more.As for content, I am very thrilled to say that it is mostly left uncensored, which is, all things considered for Viz Media, a general improvement on other releases. But here lies my biggest gripe: original versions have kept some of the translated \u201dsexual\u201d jokes, such as Misty calling Red a pervert for \u201cgroping her\u201d (he wasn\u2019t, he was carrying her to safety), and some direct mentions of dating one another. This edition seems to have either kept more recent censor revisions, rather than being truly untainted, which I find slightly disappointing. There\u2019s really never any need to censor things, for the most part, and I think this particular instance was a mistake. I am assuming that all volumes retain a certain \u2018G-rated standard,\u2019 and luckily, I don\u2019t remember too many \u2019racy\u2019 moments in this series. If there are moments that seem just slightly off or contrived, I\u2019ll have to assume it\u2019s because of a censorship that\u2019s rewritten my memories.But at the end of the day, this release is a genuine delight. It far exceeds my expectations, as I was fully expecting another cheap Viz release, and I am grateful to have this series back in my shelves for the first time in years, and this time more \u201ccomplete\u201d than ever before.If you, or someone close to you is/are a fan of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise in some capacity, I guarantee that this is will be a delight. Take it from a life-long fan that this is the Pok\u00e9mon story you have been waiting for - and this just happens to be to date, the best (and currently, cheapest?) edition to get ahold of.",

I know the Pokemon manga is considered \"dark\" for a kids manga, but I remember reading it as a kid and loved it. The resounding themes are still focused on friendship and adventure with enemies that are slightly more realistic compared to the anime (as realistic as things can be when they're all about Pokemon). My cousin told me the kids loved it and my cousin is one of those Moms who are kind of controlling about what sort of things her kids consume as media, and I'm glad it also passed her approval. 10/10 great for all ages.",

                "reviewText": "I've always been interested in the Pokemon Adventures comics but in the 20+ years I've been a fan of Pokemon I'd never actually looked into buying them until I saw this product listed here for such a reasonable price.Since this is a collector's edition intended mostly for existing fans I'll focus on the quality of the physical product rather than the quality of the story/art. The book reads right to left as is typical with manga. It is primarily in black and white, with a few color illustrations at the very front. The book feels high quality for a paperback and I see no issues with the print quality.I anticipate I'll be buying volume 2 once I finish reading this one.",
