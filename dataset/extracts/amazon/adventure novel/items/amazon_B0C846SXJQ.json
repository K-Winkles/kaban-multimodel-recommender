Only their galleons and corsairs have been replaced with offshore racing boats and motorcycles.",

Now I have two to look forward to, plus Charity. I too am a long time Parrothead and was so sad when he passed. His music and memories of times shared with friends listening to him and going to his shows are some of the best memories of my life. We even decided to honor him when we got a new car a week or so after he passed so if you see a license plate that says JB 9123, you'll know it's one of your's and Jimmy's biggest fans.",
