Do not get this if you have not read at least 12 and 11.Mild spoilers includedThis novel is my favorite by far as it does not talk about anything serious while showing the growth of Rudeus into a full blown father. I dread the following novel as the peace from this one cannot continue! But after the depression from the previous novel this one is a breath of fresh air. For those who were put off by 12 I highly suggest you continue and pick up this book. It is a breath of fresh air and will have you smiling from ear to ear for the entire thing!",
