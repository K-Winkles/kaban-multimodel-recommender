(The Stolen Century is my other favorite, but that\u2019s a couple years away.) I\u2019m happy to report that seeing the battle race on paper was just as awesome as what I pictured in my head. What I didn\u2019t expect was how well done the Hurley and Sloane relationship was presented. TAZ story has tugged on heartstrings in the past, but their story resonated more than the rest. When you add in Merle and the Director\u2019s conversation about the human spirit, the especially sharp comedy, and all of the race and tower action, this is a chapter that is... wait for it... firing on all cylinders. Worth the wait, right?",

The artists and writers have really gotten into the vibe and feeling that is so prevalent in the podcast, while still letting the visual medium shine.If you have not listened to the podcast, or don't have time to, as it is long, this is a fantastic way to experience the silly and amazing adventures that the McElroy's go through, in a much more compact medium. I HIGHLY recommend this series.",

Did a really good job condensing the original material without losing anything, with plenty of references for people who have listened to the podcast without expecting anyone to have listened to it. There's good foreshadowing for what is to come. Illustrations are absolutely amazing, and flow really well. The visuals match the story in a really good way.",

Its really worth it <3Even if Petals to the Metal wasnt my favorite arc originally, this comic made it amazing, enticing and eletrifying! Cant wait for the next!!!",

                "reviewText": "The Adventure Zone: Petals to the Metal is the latest and greatest instalment in the graphic novel adaptation of the superb podcast The Adventure Zone. Our heroes Merle, Taako and Magnus are thrust into the cutthroat world of battlewagon racing in order to retrieve another mysterious artifact. There's action, comedy, love and even an inspiring speech that gave me goosebumps.Podcast fans willbe delighted to see some of their favourite characters for the first time includingCaptain Captain Bane and Garyl the spectral binicorn and once again Carey Pietsch does an amazing job bringing these characters to life. The artwork is superb throughout and well worth the price of admission on its own.The whole thing is fantastic but the Hurley and Sloane arc was presented better here than even in the podcast and really made the heart of everything TAZ shine through.Bonus points for again including a section at the back of the book to showcase some of the amazing fan art developed by the TAZ community. There really are some wickedly talented folks out there.",
