Good expression (which I'm picky about), great backgrounds and the text is big enough for me to see with my 59-year-old self's bifocals.And Boo. Seriously. Just saying \"Space Hamster\" brightens up my day. Especially if you say it randomly as an exclamation or expletive. Try it in an elevator. Nine times out of ten you'll get the car to yourself. The tenth time someone will yell back \"Go for the eyes, Boo!\" and you'll make a new friend.Get it, you'll love it!

The binding itself is somewhat subpar for the price, however. The first few pages came loose after the first reading (kinda like my copy of the 5e PHB actually). All in all, happy with the purchase. Good stories, good plot twists and great art.",
