At each crossing point of the story you get to choose to make one decision or another which in turn affects who the winner will be. Different outcomes are available so that either one could win depending on your choices. The author's voice is written in a highly comedic tone that keeps kids laughing from start to finish. A fun short read that's perfect for any imaginative child or one who has a short attention span. Definitely would recommend",
