But they all apear in the right places at the right times and it all works. I will freely admit that I have felt like there was a drop in the quality of the story telling and especially in the wrap it all up in a neat clean bow finishes of the Jesse McDermitt series over the last six or so books. Although this one had a wrap it up with the nice clean bow finish, it actually fit this time. And I enjoyed the weaving of more of Jesse's back story through the character of Tank. I am also looking forward to at least a few more appearances of Tank in future books.Read this book. If it's the first time for you reading a Jesse McDermitt book, go back and read the series from the beginning. The characters will become like family to you and you will better understand the interaction between all the characters in this story. I am actually looking forward again to what comes next for Jesse and crew. That hasn't happened for a while.",

                "reviewText": "This was a very different story involving the disappearance of a beautiful young girl who had gone to pick up a body surfing board and then go to work at K-Mart. She never arrived, and the police having no leads wrote it off as she must have taken off. When nothing changed on the investigation Cobies Mom talked to her boss and he asked Jesse if he could help. Jesse met with Donna, Cobies mom and told her he would look into it. The trail was linked to big time drug dealers and it didn\u2019t take long for Jesse to make some connections as to who was responsible. Great story with some chilling moments not unlike those that have been vested upon kidnapped young women used as sex slaves in many parts of our world.",

Jesse is a little older, has become a family man which makes him think before acting. However, when he sets a plan in motion, it is as exciting as ever. The part I most enjoyed was the return of Owen \"Tank\" Tankersley which provides a window into his world, some of which is very poignant. He and Jesse embark on fulfilling Tank's bucket list, while setting a rescue in motion. Charity Styles also makes an appearance to assist in this multi-location, mobile and time sensitive effort. I had some mixed emotions with the outcome, but I am not going to take off a point for that .... it's a personal thing .... others will love it. I'm looking forward to Rising Tide!",

This series is a fine example of why Wayne Stinnett has earned his spot among great adventure writers such as Cussler. I prefer these books due to their more relatable locations. I spend a lot of time on the water off my home state of South Carolina but live further inland in the Appalachia Foothills. The past year of uncertainty, lockdowns & other insanity has made it difficult to even make the 3+ hour drive to the intracoastal, but reading Jesse McDermitt\u2019s adventures have become a happy escape on their own. I recommend this book & I can not wait for more!Fair winds & following seas,T. Hayes",

I have read every Jesse McDermitt novel in the series and pre-ordered #20 as soon as it was available for pre-order. Every one of those books has been a joy to read, but this time Wayne Stinnett has outdone himself. This is the best of the series yet. I finished the book in under 24 hours simply because I could not put it down. Character development if full and rich. You know these people and like most of them. The action is fast paced and has you on the edge of your seat. I especially liked that some favorite characters were brought back into this story.

Jessie was his brilliant best doing what he has always done and killing off the bad guys into the bargain, then splitting up the gold. Very interesting to find out about Tank and the US Marine Corps.It was lovely to read about all his contemporaries too and at last he has found someone to hopefully live with for the rest of his life (Wayne) to take note!!",
