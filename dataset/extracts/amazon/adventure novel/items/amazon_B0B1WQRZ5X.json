A few individuals including the King know of his past, but keep the secret so he can lead a relatively normal life. Then, on his way home from the entrance ceremony for the Royal Academy, a mysterious man suddenly transports him to an unknown location. The stranger tells Cain that a disaster is about to descend, and that he is the only one who can save this world.",
