Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hallway every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories. He spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books -- the very first adventures of Dog Man and Captain Underpants.In the second grade, Dav's teacher ripped up his comics and told him he couldn't spend the rest of his life making silly books.Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener."

                "reviewText": "Although our grandson is 10, I still often read aloud in the car (he lives 3.5 hours away, so we have a lot of time to read when we pick him up and take him home for visits). While our grandson LOVES this series, my husband and I are not fans, so I order these books from Amazon and have them delivered directly to him to read himself. The same is true of the newer Cat Kid Comic Club books. Kids love these books. . . .",
