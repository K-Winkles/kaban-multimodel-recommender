He is off to the UK with an unknown person and the fun begins. It is a woman \ud83d\udeba whose husband is trying too kill her. From the UK to New York City to Maine back to New York City to \ud83d\udd11 West back to New York City to Connecticut and back to New York City where it all ends. I would highly recommend this series and author to \ud83d\udc4d readers of action mystery novels \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udd30. Enjoy the adventure of reading \ud83d\udc53 or listening \ud83c\udfb6 to Alexa read books \ud83d\udcda. 2023 \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc52\ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\ude2fStuart Woods is one of my all time favorite authors.

                "reviewText": "These novels are a special treasure that I'm fortunate to be able to enjoy, my guilty pleasure so to speak. It begins with Stone and Dino being drafted by Lance Cabot to provide protection and safe haven for a congressional witness; who they don't even get to meet until they have left New York airspace on the way to England. This is a delightful romp with our heroes jetting from New York City to the south of England, and from Maine to Florida attempting to safeguard the former wife of a crooked senator and his henchman. These books are pure fun and an enjoyable experience, I look forward to each new one like it's my birthday, I'm excited for it to come but then it's over too quickly. I know there will be another book after a time and that makes it alright. Stone won't save the world or teach us any meaningful life lessons but he is great company for a long afternoon or a lazy weekend. I recommend these titles wholeheartedly, at least until Stone starts chasing ambulances, but knowing Stuart Woods, he'd find a way to make it an interesting read.",

                "reviewText": "I love these Stone Barrington books. Never a literary masterpiece, they are, however a great escape/mind candy. This one was so bad I couldn\u2019t enjoy it. Did this get written and edited in a weekend?The quality of Safe House was so poor that I couldn\u2019t enjoy it. It reads like a first draft, not a published work. For example, in the final chapters of the book there are so many holes in the plot (the Senator somehow avoids any police inquiry) , so many loops left open (where did all the security people go?), and so many lazy head scratchers (in Connecticut, they go to a restaurant and have no idea where other team members have gone), that I felt insulted, stupid for paying for this book.One thing Woods does well in this book is continue to reinforce his outdated prejudice and hatred towards Republicans, Christians and conservative media by reinforcing outdated stereotypes. The way he portrays these elements is offensive\u2026 to one\u2019s intellect. Stuart must live in an echo chamber. In the past I\u2019ve tolerated this indulgence. Now I\u2019m just tired of his lack of imagination.It feels sad to say this, but is the last Stone Barrington book I will have ever purchased. I wish I could get back my $15 and 3+ hours of reading.",

Not a book has gone by he hasn't slept with 2-3-4 women. In one book. That's getting very tiring. I'm surprised he hasn't caught a venereal disease.",

                "reviewText": "I have, over the years, since reading New York Dead, enjoyed the Stone Barrington series, for the most part ... especially so the earlier tales ... so I tend to approach each new release with some eagerness. This one had its moments ... I did enjoy another visit to the English manor house, for instance, but I discovered myself having less and less sympathy for the \"victim\" as the tale unfolded, and at one point even thought that Woods was attempting (unsuccessfully) to create a character with an alter-ego, given that her later actions did not match her earlier ones. I lost that necessary ingredient of any sympathy for the \"wronged\" character, and thus had nothing left to invest in the outcome. I still like Stone Barrington as a character and trust that Woods will offer a more accessible tale in his next effort. I give it two stars because Stone Barrington has a few good moments, but overall, this tale was disappointing.",
