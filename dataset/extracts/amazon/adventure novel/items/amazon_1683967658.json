I was expecting a whole book about them, so when I first glanced through it's pages and saw Scrooge, The Gummi Bears, etc., I was quite confused and even thought at first it was a printing error or something like that. So in that sense it is kind of disappointing, even though the quality of the book is very good in general, and most probably the \"other stories\" are fun, but not what I thought I was purchasing, so be aware of that, and you may give it 5 stars, but since it was not clear to me, I cannot.",
