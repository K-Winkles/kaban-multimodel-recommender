He's off to the royal capital to make his debut when scores of orcs swarm a carriage holding two young noble girls. He saves them both, and finds himself doubly engaged to be married! And then the god of commerce makes a seemingly impossible demand -- one for which his magic is useless, and only his knowledge of Earth can help him achieve!",
