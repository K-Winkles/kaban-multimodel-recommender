There, he learns how to survive the cruelty of the Confederate guards and the perfidy of others who are prisoners themselves.When the war ends, he and almost 1,500 others crowd aboard the riverboat Sultana, which has a capacity of just under 400 passengers. When tragedy strikes, Lucas finds himself further adrift. Returning home to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, he becomes a police officer, where he finds an unexpected love interest in a journalist who works for the Cape Girardeau newspaper.But as Lucas finds himself no longer able to remain in Cape Girardeau, he begins a western drift. Rambling without a specific destination and becoming a bounty hunter, he ventures into the untamed West\u2026where the call of the open road just may lead him to wander forever. Read more",

The Andersonville prison life, escaping the boat explosion, and the many adventures of Lucas Cain getting the bad guy. At the end I didn\u2019t like the idea that they had a court, judge, and jury, when Lucas Cain was not guilty, and there was plenty of evidence that he wasn\u2019t. The sheriff investigated and found him innocent. Was this just \u201cbook filler?\u201d That part of the story wasted time and wasn\u2019t going anywhere. The prosecutor in the vest\u2014what was his story. He was too stupid wasting the town\u2019s money and time! Too bad he left Sue Ellen and didn\u2019t find love. Maybe in the next book.",

The settings lack accurate historical details in the small western towns visited, the many saloons (where considerable actions occurs ) or even the shops or businesses that feature in the narrative. Meanwhile even the landscapes are virtually ignored! Thus the novel does not develop the mood, atmosphere or complexity that the better western texts achieve.",
