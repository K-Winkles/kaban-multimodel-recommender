The quality is just lacking compared to other \"Illustrated Classics\" types of books like \"Great Illustrated Classics\" by Baronet Books or \"Treasury of Illustrated Classics\" by Kappa Books Publishers. I really wanted to just collect all the books from \"Treasury of Illustrated Classics\" style books, but they don't have Robin Hood on Amazon so I opted for \"Great Illustrated Classics\" only to realize when this arrived that it was just plain \"Illustrated Classics\" so yeah, I didn't realize until now that there could be so many varieties of illustrated classics books, but you learn something new every day I guess lol",
