It's not 4-stars because it had quite a few grammar mistakes, which was disappointing and lazy to me. Warriors has a HUGE writing team, there should not have been this many mistakes that were VERY noticeable. But as a huge Brightheart fan, this was a great book, and I definitely recommend for those who've read the first Warriors series.",

It\u2019s inspired me to read the Main Warriors Series in the graphic novel forum if the author permits it.",
