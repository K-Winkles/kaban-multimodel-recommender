I am very impressed with how this manga looked and how the story it told, went! Tomozo and Masuo Kinko, thank you and well done with this manga series so far! I haven\u2019t read volume #2 or #3 yet, but I will soon! Just want to give you a review, since this series doesn\u2019t have a lot of them yet. Readers of my reviews, if you love Isekai and/or fantasy, please give this manga series a chance! I really think you will all love it and enjoy it as I have!FINAL RATING: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

(Plus he's not tagging along with two children that he asked to raise that are bastards from a demi god that doesn't want to raise them....heheheI hope you enjoy this story also! Try the Great Cleric for another good one.That's one of the things I really like about this story.",
