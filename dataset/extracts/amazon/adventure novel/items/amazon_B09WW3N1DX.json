                "reviewText": "Tokyo Express USS Bull Shark Naval Thriller Series, Book 4 assumed published copyright and written by Scott W. Cook.This 4th book in the seemingly popular suspense thriller series by this author again follows the activities of the brilliantly aggressive Captain Art Turner of the somewhat unusually designed USS Bull Shark submarine as it operates in the Pacific Ocean from August 15, 1942 through August 24th, 1942 and sometime beyond through an Epilogue. Most of the main action described takes place in the waters surrounding Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Gavutu, Tanambogo and especially those of New Georgia where the Sealark Channel, popularly called \u201cThe Slot\u201d provided a straight supply line from the Japanese Holdings at Rabaul and Bougainville. Once the U.S. had established their base on Guadalcanal and completed Henderson Airfield, their air superiority gave them control of this area during the day. This provides the base for this fact based novel.To overcome the problem of supplying Japanese troops in these areas, Admiral Yamamoto developed a plan of running the fast destroyers down the slot at night when air power did not operate with any degree of success and destroyers were specially equipped to fight submarine attacks if attempted. The Americans immediately named it the Tokyo Express. Along with these naval engagements, Several Marine-Japanese hand to hand engagements are included with men serving on the subs as well as with the Marines included. A couple of naval battles - Solomon Islands, Savage Islands and individual Carrier-Enemy Aircraft engagements also are included.Discussion: The author\u2019s knowledge of his subject appears to be quite extensive as his description of pertinent minutia with respect to submarine working parts, movement, maneuverability and the results of attacks described, as well as the effects of bombs received by surface craft. His descriptions of hand-to-hand combat as well as other land battle scenes and their aftermath also are graphically set forth and thus, just as horrifying to the uninitiated as those of the results of a ship\u2019s receipt of bombs from the air as described. The author\u2019s understanding of the psychological aspects, pertinent perhaps more particularly to submarine warfare, appear to be quite accurate, as well. This is the second of the series I have read, and highly recommend as a WW II thriller.5* Highly recommended war thriller.",

                "reviewText": "Tokyo Express: A WWII Submarine Adventure Novel by Scott Cook allows readers to experience WWII from the perspective of several characters. Readers can appreciate what occurred during the Battle for Guadalcanal. The commences by providing a backstory however, after a few pages readers will find the prologue. The book provides an entirely different insight into the war, providing an opening to provide background knowledge by describing people, places, and events in detail.The book focuses on the behind-the-scenes events such as the retelling of ritual suicide, changes to commanding officers, and the crew's feelings about the changes made on the USS Bull Shark. After writing a note for his crew to find, the captain flings himself overboard, surrendering himself to the sea. The personal feelings and narratives of the crew were expressed which allows readers to know intimate details others may have forgotten. Almost halfway through the book, readers can expect to read about the spoils of war.\u201cSubmarine warfare was, in some ways, unlike any other kind. Each type of fighting, be it air to air combat, large infantry clashes, hand to hand fighting, or big surface ships lobbing massive shells at one another, had its unique aspects, but they also had something in common. Most types of warfare allowed men to take an active role in fighting back.\u201dDespite the unfortunate events that transpired, the author doesn\u2019t stick to one plot, however, each subplot is well developed, however, the extra storylines crowd one other throughout the novel. Almost to the end of the novel, Cook reveals a traitor aboard the sub that sabotages the mission.\u201cYou sent information to the Americans about our forces, Osaka. Did you not realize that we could monitor your activity? Did you really think that the repair crews would fail to find the cable that you deliberately cut?\u201dThe book\u2019s lengthy bibliography points to immense research and it meticulously depicts the setting and the era - both elements which are crucial to understanding and relating to the story. Tokyo Express, though sometimes there is an overload of information, the attention is pulled from the main plot.",
