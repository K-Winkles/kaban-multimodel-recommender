        "description": "Lukinbox area rugs, which create a warm atmosphere in your home by providing comfort under your feet with their environmentally production, provide a beautiful appearance in your home.How to Flatten a Rug That\u2019s Been FoldedPrevent the CreasesBefore you put your rug away in storage, always be sure to give it a proper cleaning.Tightly Roll the Rug When StoringTypically, you\u2019ll want to roll the rug with the pile facing inward (the pile is the top side of the rug), as the pile is more fragile.Store in a Cool EnvironmentLast but not least, make sure you store your rug in a cool, dry environment, and preferably one that\u2019s off the ground. Also, don\u2019t place anything on top of the rug, as this can cause cracks and creases.How to Getting Out the CreasesRipples/WavesTypically, a rug will have ripples or waves in it if it is a new rug. All you need to do is lay the rug flat, and the waves will even themselves out after a day or two. CornersTo flatten corners, a lot of people think the best thing to do is to place a heavy object on them. While this can work, the best thing to do is to actually fold the corners under and let them rest for a day or two.IroningOnly resort to ironing if the creases are still present after waiting two full days. Start by ironing it on the lowest setting possible with the steam on. If your iron doesn\u2019t have a steam setting, sprinkle on some water before you begin. To protect the rug from being burned by the iron, place a piece of plain brown craft paper between the iron and the rug.",

It is soft, and comfortable, and it\u2019s become the de-facto activity and dance floor for my kids.SizeThe rug is true to size according to the product description, and it covers a very large area.WashabilityI think I understand why this rug is thin, it\u2019s so it\u2019s washable. It fit in a normal front-loader dishwasher, and dried easily in the drier. I was worried that the color would leech or something, but the pattern was perfect even after washing!",

                "reviewText": "The rug is soft and thick but low profile at the same time. Took a little while to get the creases out from packaging but it ended up laying flat. I had to already wash it once do to child spilling a drink. To my surprise it was simple to wash and the stain came right out with the washer machine. Large rug great for many spaces in my opinion. Fantastic value for the money.",

Vacuum goes right over it and spills clean up easily. We got the blue and really like it! Fabric is soft and great for our toddler to play on.",

                "reviewText": "This is a typical machine washable rug - although I got the 9x12 size so I will have to take it to the special laundromat. Anyway it won't need laundering often because it repels liquids, they just bead up on the surface. And a good vacuum and a microfiber cloth keeps it clean. It is thin like a tapestry so you just have to lay it our and stretch out all the creases and it stays put. It has a very low pile. I put it on top of another rug of the same size to protect that rug from my dog's messes. It looks just like the photo. If you don;t use a rug or pad underneath it would not provide much cushioning, but would still look nice.",
