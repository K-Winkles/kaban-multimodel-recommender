Super easy to clean and while it isn't plush or plush to walk on it is soft to the touch and cleans nicely - Might be too heavy to throw in washer - I haven't tried but spot cleaning is super easy! The colors are vibrant and I just love this so much!!",

I needed it to tie the room together and be friendly for dogs and kids. I\u2019m curious to see how it will do in my standard washer since it is VERY heavy. I may just have to take it to the laundromat which is inconvenient but that\u2019s ok. The colors are beautiful and match my couches so well. Creases won\u2019t come out I guess it will need to be washed first. The doggies already approve.",

There is no cushion to it, so it feels as hard as the floor you\u2019re covering. As thin and flimsy as it is, however, it is stylish, and appears to be constructed fairly well. Threads are tight, with no inconsistencies.Would I buy it again? I honestly can\u2019t say for sure. If I buy some anti slip matting, and put it under, then yes. That would give it some of the cushioning it needs, and might hold it down, better. But, it does make more work, for me, that I shouldn\u2019t have.",

I would smell it THROUGH the box. As soon as we opened it the entire room then stank. It\u2019s been 24 hours and our entire upstairs still smells like plastic.Trying to set it up was SO different than a regular non washable rug. It took two adults almost 45 minutes and a lot of cussing to get it straight and it still has wrinkles in it. It came FOLDED RATHER THAN ROLLED which was so bizarre to me.It\u2019s sad bc I had really high hopes but unless the manufacturer can provide some info on why it reeks of plastic we will probably just throw it away. Don\u2019t think we could reasonably ship this back at this point.Big waste of 160$",
