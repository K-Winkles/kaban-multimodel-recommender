                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting much for the super low price, but I'm so impressed! It's super soft and feels great on the feet and since it doesn't have the stiff backing like most rugs it's super easy to fold up and move and you don't have to train it with books for a week to get it to lie flat. Also makes cleaning it so much easier! I also love how well it matches the throw pillow I got (Walmart). I matched it using the ad photo on my phone and it is true to color- matches perfectly!",
