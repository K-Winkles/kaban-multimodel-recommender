It's not super thick, but it's absolutely beautiful and I've received many compliments. I can't stand those old scratchy. Rugs, but this one is not like that at all. The colors are absolutely stunning and the pattern is gorgeous. Won't scratch your floor up. You can also take this outside and wash it if you wanted to -- I haven't done it yet but I will soon.",

                "reviewText": "We love this rug! Rug arrived folded in a box, once it was laid flat all of the creases came out. For the price this is an awesome rug. It's not a thick soft rug but it fits our needs and works well with the dogs. Easy to vacuum and so far have been able to use it with a rug pad or anything to hold it in place. Design is great, would purchase again",
