                "reviewText": "I recently moved and there was no carpeting throughout the entire place so I wanted to get rugs for certain parts of the house. This one was for my living room and it looks beautiful. When it comes to look,make and feel it def does not come off cheap or inexpensive at all. It is about the length of a loveseat maybe a bit longer and the thickness is thin but not paper thin. The rug is really soft too my kids all love it and I've seen them at times just laying or rubbing their feet on it. The colors are beautiful as well I am going for a neutral color scheme like creams and light wood and so far it is looking just how I imagined it would. I think my only complaint is because I need more of it that I wish it was a bit bigger both in length and width but other than this I think this would be a wonderful piece to add to any home.",

                "reviewText": "The rug looks great. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver. Even though it's on the thinner side, the material is durable and well constructed. The design print is vivid and the pattern is clearly visible throughout. I like the fade like effect throughout the design that gives it a bit of age and character. The great thing about these rugs are the fact that they can be washed. Depending on the size, it may be a bit too big for a home washing machine but it is certainly worth an occasional trip to a commercial laundromat to clean the rug as needed.",

                "reviewText": "We have a large room that we recently had redone from carpeting to hardwood. We\u2019d left the floor bare, but I\u2019d been thinking that it might be a bit cold this coming winter. I love the hardwoods and didn\u2019t want to cover them with a large area rug. I decided I\u2019d be happier with one or two smaller throw rugs, so I chose this pink one as a start. The listing says it\u2019s light pink, but I would describe it as more of a bold saturated pink with almost a salmon shade to it. It\u2019s pretty, but definitely a pop of color.I received it folded so there were some significant creases in it. My first thought was to lay it out on the floor and hope the folds relaxed on their own. That just wasn\u2019t happening, so I decided to go ahead and put it in the washer and dryer. I followed the washing instructions, and it did great. There were no more creases or fold lines, and washing it fluffed it up a bit.It\u2019s not a thick, heavy rug and it has a very low pile, so it doesn\u2019t provide a cushiony surface to walk across. It\u2019s extremely soft though, and almost velvety when you walk on it barefooted. It adds a lot of visual warmth to the room and has a rubber-like backing so it stays in place well.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't be happier with my recent purchase of this super cute rug for my tiny 9ft x 7ft studio office. Not only does it perfectly match my office aesthetic, but it's also incredibly soft, making it a cozy addition to my workspace.With hardwood floors in my office, the rug serves a practical purpose by providing much-needed insulation during the colder fall and winter months. It's like a warm, welcoming hug for my feet. Having rugs on hardwood floors is an absolute must, and this one does the job beautifully.What's even more impressive is the convenience it offers. The fact that it's vacuumable and machine washable is a game-changer. I've put it to the test, and it comes out looking as good as new. It's such a relief to know that keeping it clean and fresh is a breeze.In summary, this rug not only elevates the aesthetic of my office but also serves a functional purpose, keeping my feet warm and comfortable. It's a must-have for anyone with hardwood floors. Plus, its easy maintenance makes it a practical and stylish addition to any space.",
