                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I ordered the gray 8x10 rug. It arrived boxed and folded into a giant cube. The pictures show what the rug looked like once we positioned it after opening. These pictures are a few minutes after we laid it on the floor. As you can see, the rug flattened out quickly upon opening.The rug is SOFT. Oh my gosh so soft!The rug is thin, it doesn't have a thick padding under it at all, so this rug isn't for comfort, purely for looks. Which, it is washable. Unfortunately, this will NOT fit in my washing machine as our washing machine has an agitator. I'll have to take it to a laundry mat when it's time to wash, and I'll try and update the review at that time.As the rug is thin and made for washing, vacuuming it is a bit of a challenge. We have 4 dogs and 3 of them shed. 1 is part Shepard and has a double coat so she sheds like it's her job.I was able to vacuum the rug with a lower setting on my vacuum. So just be aware of that when you purchase this rug.The rug is non-slip. We tried to drag it to reposition it and it was almost impossible to move it. So if you need a thin, washable, non-slip rug, this is for you!-Wife",

                "reviewText": "So far, this rug is working out perfectly for my space. It's really soft and plush with a super cool design. The rug does not feel cheap at all and is washable. The other thing I love is that it is OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 certified. This means that this rug has been the tested against a huge list of over 1,000 chemicals that could pose risks to human health. In this case, I feel comfortable wearing bare feet on this rug. AAA++++!",

                "reviewText": "Obsessed with the way this rug feels. I want to live barefoot on it all day. This rug is very thin but feels like silk on top. It's HUGE. Because it is very thin it can wrinkle easily if on carpet but has a sticky back designed to help it stick on top of tile. Beautiful design. The dark green is true to the picture and compliments our bedroom plants. Would get another in another color just because they feel so nice to lay on.",
