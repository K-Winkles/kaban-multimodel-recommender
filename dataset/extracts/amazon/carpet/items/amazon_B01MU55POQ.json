I bought the 10\u2019x7\u2019 rug. I bought a treadmill and felt very dissatisfied by the reviews. Regarding those mats you have to buy to put under the treadmill. I thought to myself, \u2018Why am I buying this silly mat for $40-50? I can just buy a inexpensive rug that I shan\u2019t feel upset if it gets a bit worn, and I can cover the rest of my floor with\u2019. Then I found this beauty! I used gorilla tape, secure it down.Does not look cheap & nice feel to it. I am hoping it will stand up to my multiple pets & LA air particles (I keep my balcony door & windows open almost 24/7. I will update when one must hoover & deep clean it.",
