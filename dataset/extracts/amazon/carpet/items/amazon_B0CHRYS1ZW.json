                "reviewText": "Unbelievably silky soft slick feeling!!!! Like I swear to you, if you felt this and were blindfolded you would swear it's real rabbit fur!!!! Honestly, I am blown away by this Ashler Faux Rabbit Fur Rug for Christmas, Black 2x6 FT Fluffy Soft Runner Area Rug, Rectangle Machine Washable Shaggy Fur Carpet!I have no idea how they accomplished this, but I LOVE it! I got it in black, and it's a true inky jet black color, not one of those that is supposed to be black but really isn't which you can only tell when you put other colors up against it. My hardest choice was deciding what color to get this in as they are all so beautiful! To get this item and it's machine washable too just WOW! I sure hope it does not change the feel of it!I can honestly imagine laying several of these down together to cover a larger area, that would just be heaven to my feet! LOL The pile is a good length, there really is no padding though and on the back is the rubberized to help prevent it shifting. Don't know that will for sure stop it from shifting when my female rottie gets to bouncing around as she does (she's a goofball LOL) and not sure that would be a fair test for the rug either. LOL A robovac may have an issue with this rug.But the rug is slick enough feeling I would be careful walking on it so you do not fall and I would for sure not try running across it LOL. So do be mindful where you place it, may not be the best option with young children or elderly.Personally I am excellent with the quality/features of this rug VS the price. The listing has it at $40.99 currently. You can get a cheaper rug, not going to argue that point, BUT if you want one that is truly the best imitation I have ever found for rabbit fur then this is THE rug for you!As always I only do honest reviews and will update if needed. I hope this helps you make the best choices on how to spend your $.",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely thrilled with my Ashler Faux Rabbit Fur Rug in light grey, size 2x6. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was the perfect addition to my living room. I already had a similar white faux rabbit fur throw that all my guests fight over in the winter, so I was eager to add this rug to my collection.Although it's technically designed to be used as a rug, I had a different idea in mind. I wanted to use it as a luxurious and soft top for my upholstered ottoman. It fits perfectly, and the moment I placed it on top, my living room was transformed into a cozy and inviting space.The rug is incredibly soft and has a bubbled surface that adds to its fluffy softness. The light grey color is the perfect complement to my grey living room and looks absolutely beautiful. It exceeded my expectations and is definitely one of the best orders I've made for my home.What's even better is that the rug is completely washable and easy to maintain. I can simply toss it in the washing machine, and it comes out looking just as good as new. The only challenge I'm currently facing is convincing my cats to share it with me! I highly recommend this rug to anyone looking for a comfortable, cozy, and luxurious addition to their home decor.",

I have ordered a handful of fur throws and rugs and I never know what to expect.. this rug exceeded my expectations!My home decor has a white theme.No matter where I put this, it will look beautiful. Now the hardest decision is finding a place to put it. I don't know if I should use it as a decor rug or use it as a throw like over my sectional or back cushions. Ugh decisions decisions \ud83d\ude44I was drinking espresso and the cup knocked over and got all over the rug. I threw it in the washing machine using cold water and on a short delicate cycle and air dry. Once dry I put it in the dryer on tumble for 10 min. I was so nervous that I would ruin it BUT it washed/dried beautifully!The quality is amazing and the rug is so so soft like your petting a bunny. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc07\ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc30I highly recommend purchasing!GREAT QUALITY \u2022 AFFORDABLE \u2022 GIFTABLE",

I tried it barefoot - not quite like an ice rink, but very close.It's very, very beautiful, but someone is going to get injured using this as a rug.",

I almost didn't give it to him because I could imagine waking up and stepping onto this luxuriously soft rug when I got out of bed. It was a very tough decision.Do follow the instructions and wash before use. It's quite easy to wash and toss in the dryer. I suspect if you don't wash first the carpet may shed more than you'd like. It may also contain chemicals from manufacturing. That's something I always watch for with my dog is chemical fumes from something like a carpet.The price isn't bad for the size. I may buy another one just for the side of my bed.Recommended.",
