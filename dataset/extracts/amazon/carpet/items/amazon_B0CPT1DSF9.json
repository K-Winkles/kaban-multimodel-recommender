        "description": "FALARK Area Rugs - The perfect choice for home decor FALARK rugs cater to modern indoor minimalist decor and are dedicated to creating premium plush area rugs that are loved by all ages. About Our Shag Rugs 1. The materials used in our furry rugs allow children or pets to use them with confidence. 2. We adopt an upgraded processing technology to make our carpets more durable, with no shedding or fading of the fluff, and no warping of the edges. 3. The soft velvets relax and warm your feet, the thickened sponge pad provides sound insulation effect, the non-woven backing protects your floor, and latex particles protect you from slipping. 4. Our shaggy rugs are machine washable, but we suggest putting them in a laundry bag or hand washing to extend their lifespan. Shopping Tips 1. Our fluffy carpets are vacuum packaged and may have some creases upon received, but the creases will disappear after 2-3 days of lying flat 2. Due to compression transportation, the carpet may appear a bit thin at first. Don't worry, it will return to a fluffy state after 2-3 days. You can also use a hair dryer to fluff the carpet up faster. 3. When opening the packaging, the carpet may emit some odor, which is a normal phenomenon caused by warehouse storage. Please leave it in a well ventilated place for 1-2 days, and the odor will dissipate. Any other questions, please feel free to contact us.",

It doesn't slide on the actual floor, just your feet slip on the surface. It fluffed up quickly upon opening, it doesn't shed, is easy to vacuum, is soft and cushy, and looks luxurious. I would recommend putting it under a chair or near a bed where your feet can feel it when you touch the floor, but you don't have to walk far.",
