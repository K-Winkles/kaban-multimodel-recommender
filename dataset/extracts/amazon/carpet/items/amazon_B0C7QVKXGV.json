                "reviewText": "We recently remodeled our kitchen with white upper cabinets and blue lower cabinets. We ordered this rug actually as a walkway runner, but the blue color was such a beautiful match to our lower kitchen cabinets, that we put it in front of the sink area. We liked it so well that we immediately ordered 2 more to finish the room.This rug is so soft that I just want stand on it barefoot and rub my feet back and forth. Weird, but it even feels soft when I have socks on. It has a good backing, and the rug does not slide on our tile floor. The edging is nicely stitched, and while I prefer a banded edge, this one is very welly done. The rug is not ultra thick, which makes it perfect for me scooting around the kitchen like a bee in a honey field. It is not a trip hazard for me, and when your nick name is Calamity Jane, like mine has been most of my life, that is a really good thing.The rug is even more beautiful than the picture online. Rarely do I order something that I love this much, and my even my husband said you need to go order another one Now. As soon as I did, we decided we wanted yet another, so I ordered a 3rd one. It just completes our kitchen. I had a plethora of different style and color rugs by the sink, stove, fridge and island, and it is so nice to provide a cohesive look, especially one this soft and beautiful. The other 2 rugs are supposed to arrive today, and I can hardly wait.I would not hesitate for a second to order again from Lahome, in fact I already did not hesitate at all. When I want another rug in the future, I will be looking for this brand.",
