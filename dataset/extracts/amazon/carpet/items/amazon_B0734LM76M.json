It seems like it would be fragile but it wears well and I can vacuum it with my regular vacuum and it doesn't hurt it at all. I love these rugs. It does take a few days for them to lay flat once they do all the creases from packaging come out. I bought several of these rugs in different colors and sizes and they are softer, prettier, more durable, and more luxurious than I expected them to be by far. They're so beautiful and wear so well I can keep them and use them for many years. And I was always used to a more traditional rug these are so modern. I love them. I'm using them to cover up my wood floors I don't like wood floors so I also put a half inch carpet padding under them which gives them a richer look and my wood floors are not hard on my feet. They look great and it's easy to get colors that go together with these rugs. And I decided just to get these rugs in different colors and not have mitch match rugs so all the rugs are in sync cuz they're all this make and style. So even though I put different colors in different rooms they're all in sync with this style rug and the house looks great. And these are very different from traditional shag rugs, because they don't shed and they do not lose their softness. These rugs are so nice.",

So it\u2019s difficult to watch my granddaughter love it - because the picture looked so good. So it was all about the color, gray and the oval. I on the other hand would never buy it again. It is thin and the pile is long but not thick. It will never stand up like the picture. It will lay flat, which is how it came. And it doesn\u2019t even make it to the outside edge. So the backing and stitching around the edge are completely exposed. There\u2019s no binding. Just visible stitching. I think as we head into winter the rug will not meet her imagined fluffy and warm expectations.",
