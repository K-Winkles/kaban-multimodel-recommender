Pop the rug into the washing machine with your normal detergent AND add white vinegar. Maybe like a cup for a heavily soiled rug. Vinegar helps break up the enzymes in urine and the rug will come out squeaky clean!I stopped paying big bucks for cleaners like Nature\u2019s Miracle when I learned that vinegar works just as well!",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, at first glance this is not a very nice rug. The pattern is clearly printed on, fabric is very thin, seems like the bare minimum. I'll be damned if it somehow is perfect for the task I gave it. The bottom of the rug grips great, the creases from being folded while shipping disappeared after a day. The fabric they've used is also slippery. I wanted this rug for my work from home setup. I sit in a silly ornate wooden chair that is really comfy.The texture of this rug allows for this chair to glide cleanly around my space to pull up to the desk without any pull on the rug. It feels soft and nice under my feet, vacuums well. My only concern is the printing will wear with time. It does feel somewhat cheap even if it works fantastically for it's job. which is why i knocked a star off.Other than that, it does look nice and it does work. Good product.",

                "reviewText": "This rug is beautiful and so soft! It has a very nice rubber backer, so it doesn't slide all over the floor and sticks well to the hardwood without leaving residue behind. The rug itself is nice and pliable so it seems like it will be easy to wash in the washing machine if needed. The rug fibers are medium length to give it that nice fluff while walking over it. This is a very high-quality rug, and we will definitely be getting a second to match in our hallway.",
