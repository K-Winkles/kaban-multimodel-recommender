                "reviewText": "I ordered this to replace an existing entry way mat by our front door. I really like the ornate pattern and neutral color palette of this mat and the size is perfect for most standard doors. It's very soft and easily folded out from its packaging. I took this picture right after placing it down but within 3 hours it laid completely flat and there are no lingering traces that it was once folded.The mat also includes floor adhesive strips so that you can position it on your floor and ensure that it doesn't move with traffic which is a nice feature if you are placing this by a door like us.The only thing about this mat that I don't love is how thin it is. I've ordered other similar rugs that have much more cush to them but this one is very thin. It's not something I'm using for comfort so I'm not concerned but I do wish it was slightly thicker so that it doesn't wear down easily over time.Overall, this is a really lovely mat- especially at this price point and I would recommend but be aware that it's not super thick and cushy, so best for a doormat or place where you don't need padding.",

It is currently in a living room where it doesn't get a lot of traffic. It does a reasonable job of not slipping around without any tape required (but recommended if a cat will be using it as a launch-pad).Ordered this because it is advertised as washable. Intent was to replace a plastic boot-mat for the winter, and wash as needed. However, the product is very light and thin feeling. I'm not sure how well it would hold up as a \"door mat,\" and it looks really nice on the wood floor, so we decided to not use it in front of the door. I have not washed it yet but will update this if there are any problems after doing so.I really like it. It's a really great deal for how soft it is. However, this is not a traditional-type rug with thick pile.",
