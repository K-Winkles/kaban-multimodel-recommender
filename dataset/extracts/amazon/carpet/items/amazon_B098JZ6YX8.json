It's great for looks and feel, however, if I don't want to wash it everyday, I'd like to go over it w/vaccum, BUT, my vaccum just sucks it up and clogs. So this means if a couple of leaves are tracked in (or anything I'd prefer to vaccum, I have to take it out to shake it off instead of vaccuming. For me, it's an inconvenient issue, but if it's a low traffic area, you probably wouldn't have this problem. Overall, I decided to keep it, but I have to wash it twice a week and shake it out daily. It is pretty and soft.",
