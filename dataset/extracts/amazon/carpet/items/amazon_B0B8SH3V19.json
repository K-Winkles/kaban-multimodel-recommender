            "\u3010Easy to Clean and Maintain\u3011This fur area rug can be vacuumed on the lowest gear of vacuum cleaner for daily care and wiped clean with a damp cloth if there is a small amount of staining. When a thorough cleaning is required, please wash it by hand and lay it flat to dry to fluff it up. To prolong the life of the carpet, machine washing is not recommended.",
            "\u3010Multi-scenario Use\u3011Our velvet coarse wool rug adopts a classic solid color with a simple and modern design style. Its simple color adds warmth and elegance to your home room.
