Its under my king bed and hasnt moved an inch. Lays flat, no curling on corners since day 1. But its not meant for a high traffic area like living room. It will work for a guest bedroom or study that isnt used much. The fibres are too soft for heavy traffic, and get dirty v v quickly. Some dust and small dirt like thermocol bits gets stuck in the fibre and doesnt come out easily with vaccuum because the fibres are too thin- almost meshing with each other. Wont hold up for prolonged use, but perfect for less frequently used rooms.",

It looks and feel very fragile when i received it and immediately try to initiate return and refund but the message i saw is : \"Return pending seller approval\"If you have not heard from the seller in 3 business days you may File a claim\"How do i file a claim since there is no process ,no way contact the seller . I guess one is stuck with the item and count your loss and move on",
