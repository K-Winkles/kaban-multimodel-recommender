It\u2019s slides all over hardwood floors, so we bought a non-slip rug mat. Not very soft, but it was cheap and a roomba can tackle it easily \ud83d\ude0a Trade offs.",

                "reviewText": "These rugs are excellent all around for decorating; bringing color into a room and anchoring furniture when you have large rooms with dark wood floors like I do. I have dark floors and I use dark bold colors when decorating my rooms. They really help brighten up the rooms. These rugs are thin, height wise; not thin as in sparse fibers. This is a plus in my book. Easy to clean, run robot vacuums over. They are affordable too. Back in the day, buying rugs meant $500 for a small rug because they were so thick and hand loomed. Now they are super cheap everywhere. I have purchased this rug in turquoise ivory, navy ivory and teal ivory to anchor adjacent rooms. The turquoise ivory rug has multi colors including hints of gold yellow and navy. See pic with round rug. That\u2019s the 9\u2019 round option. Sofa is 12\u2019 diameter for reference. The teal ivory is just those two colors. Ivory is the majority color with teal popping out to compliment your color palette. Very pleasing appearance. I put that one under my dining room table 9\u2019 x 12\u2019. A rug that size would have cost me over $1,000 20 some years ago. Now it\u2019s 20% the cost so I don\u2019t worry about it getting dirty or even ruined. I\u2019ll buy another. But I actually just replaced these rugs after 8 years of living in this home. The rugs I replaced were also Safavieh and held up very well. Was just time to update and they were old and getting dirty. Despite the look of my home, I do have kids and we entertain lots of friends all the time. They hold up just fine to foot traffic, dinners, etc. Not pictured is the navy and cream which is very striking in my foyer between the two rooms pictured. Excellent accent rugs. Will be back again and again.",

                "reviewText": "We have a very oversized living room with hard wood floors. It requires a overly sized rug which normally cost significantly more, however this rug was so cost effective! It's soft that the kids like to lay on it(we have a rug pad under as well for additional cushion) it's beautifully made and goes well with the neutral modern/farmhouse style theme that's in our home. The only flaw is the need for rug tape because a few of the edges kept rolling upwards which is why I only gave 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "This runner was on sale for $69 dollars just a few weeks ago, so I bought it for our very long hallway. I also purchased a runner anti slip rug mat for underneath because our floors are hard wood and very slippery. It came tightly rolled and was a breeze to unpackage and unroll. The edges were curled up just a bit and to be honest I have one corner that wont lay down, but it is the corner that you step on just as you exit the bathroom so I think that may be the reason and not anything to do with the rug itself. The rug is very soft and vacuums well! It doesnt loft off the mat or slide around. The kids and the cat play on it or lay on it all the time. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again!",
