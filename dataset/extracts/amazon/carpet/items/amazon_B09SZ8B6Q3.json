                "reviewText": "The rug is so soft on my bare feet and it is also very fluffy and comfortable, looking really thick, no bare spots and zero shedding so far, I was somewhat skeptical due to some reviews that says it sheds, I have use mine a month and not shedding at all.I bought it for my bedroom and I just love this rug. The color is beautiful and doesn\u2019t get dirty easily, I use my hand vacuum and no problem.Overall very soft and durable and easy to clean. The price is right and I highly recommended it.",

                "reviewText": "You get what you pay for. It doesn't look as nice in photos. The rug came folded up and it still has creases after laying it out for weeks. Maybe it needs to be gently ironed/steamed? There are some missing fibers on the edges too. Otherwise it is soft to walk on and looks decent from a distance.I should note however this rug is very slippery. The \"anti-slip\" features do not work at all on my old roughed-up wooden floors. It might be a nice rug for a carpeted room, but I wouldn't recommend this for hard floor, especially with children or the elderly...it feels like an accident waiting to happen.",

For $40 I got a good size, soft descent rug. It\u2019s a little thin and not quite 5 x 8 like the ad said. I would say it\u2019s closer to 4\u2019 1/2 x 7\u2019 1/2. But this works.
