                "reviewText": "I LOVE this rug! I recently threw out my shag rug and bought this one about a month ago as sort of a gamble. I was skeptical as to whether a rug thin enough to wash would look right without appearing cheap and wrinkly. I was also concerned that the pattern (being a print on fabric) would look cheesy, but I am not disappointed! The back side is rubbery so it clings nicely to the floor and stays in place. The rug surface is very silky soft and liquid tends to sit on top of the fibers rather than soaking in so minor spills are easy and manageable. We just got a puppy so the real test came after several potty accidents that cleaned up well with spot cleaning and a handheld carpet shampooer, but for sanitary reasons I threw it into the wash after a few messes. The rug cleaned up perfectly, it dried quickly and it remained perfectly intact and clinged to the floor without any wrinkling. This was a HUGE win in the gamble and $68.75 well spent with zero buyer's remorse!!",

My friend, who was there when I unboxed it, immediately told me she would take it. I ended up ordering a 2nd (bigger) one! It\u2019s super soft but also very thin and light with great color and pattern. Highly recommend.",

The design is also printed on and not actually textured, which for the price makes sense.Overall good rug but be aware of the colors!",

I use it in the family room and my toddler spills everything on it. I haven\u2019t put it in the wash yet but a little carpet stain remover has removed difficult stains very easily. Also dropped water on it several times and it was easy to clean up. Great carpet to use in an area that you have messy kids or dogs.",

Love how beautiful and soft it is!",
