It is a floral antique designed print that will look great in any room of the house. It is machine washable and features a non-slip backing to keep it in place.The area rug's surface is constructed of high-quality faux short cashmere, which has a lovely plush feel yet does not shed. As I dislike shoes, I can feel the warmth and coziness beneath the rug against my bare feet. My flooring is tile, so stepping on them rather than the hard surface is preferable.This rug is environmentally friendly and safe for my children and dogs. When it only needs a small touch-up from regular use, it can be swept, vacuumed, or cleaned with a rag. The rug is also stain resistant, which is ideal since I have children that spill and drop things.This rug is durable, beautiful, and well-suited to my space. I am pleased with the product's quality, design, and even the pricing.",
