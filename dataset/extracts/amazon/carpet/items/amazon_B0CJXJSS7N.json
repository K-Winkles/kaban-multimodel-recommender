                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t usually leave reviews, but this rug is great and affordable! With 2 young kids and 3 animals, this rug is perfect! It\u2019s so incredibly soft!! I wanted to wait to leave a review until I could wash it. And lo and behold the cat puked on it so I threw it in the wash and it was just as soft as it was prior to the wash! And it air dried super fast.Is it thin? Yes.. but it\u2019s washable so thats to be expected. I just bought a pad to put underneath it. Another thing I was super pleased with is that it didn\u2019t have that yucky new rug odor. So all this to say, it was a great purchase!",
