I also like how thin it is so that my desk chair can easily roll over it and it also has a rubber backing on the bottom so the rug doesn\u2019t slip around.However, I was super disappointed with the color. The color I got was called PINIK and I believe in the description it said orange, however, the rug I got is not as vibrant as in the pictures in the listing and the color is actually a brown looking color, so it doesn\u2019t really go that well with my office.

                "reviewText": "This rug looks even better in person than in the pictures. In fact, it's so nice, I hate to step on it unless I'm out of my shoes. That's why I've put it at the side of my bed, for I never wear shoes in the bedroom. None of that is to say it's at all unsuitable for use elsewhere, for it does stay in place well, looks cheerful, with a distinct pattern (printed on, but at this price, expecting a woven in fabric just isn't reasonable).I haven't had to wash it yet, but it seems durable, the backing's well sewn on, and the edges are well-stitched, making it highly unlikely to fray.I would buy this rug again, and given that it comes in various colors, next time I want to switch out a rug, I'll get another.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the way this rug looked in the pictures, but was disappointed with the quality of it when I received it. Hopefully, it was just the particular rug I received. There is practically no padding in it and it feels like you are steppingi straight on the floor. I hesitate to put this in front of my main entry door due to the build quality of it not being very high. It does look okay, but feels like it is going to fall apart the first time I put it in the wash. My biggest concern is the nonslip backing coming apart in the wash like other inexpensive rugs have done that I\u2019ve owned. For now, I\u2019m keeping this in a little used area of my floor so it can look pretty without heavy use.",

The color combinations are amazing and the fact they look worn and used but are still soft, clean, and durable and terrific value makes me love them even more. I use mine at the front door and in front of the bathroom vanity. These rugs are so well made, with double stitching on the non-slip backing for maximum safety. The Asrug Vintage area rugs are available in several sizes and colors; but each one is perfect for any room in your home. Highly Recommended.",

First thing you notice is how incredibly soft it is. Feels wonderful under bare feet. Colors are vibrant and stitching is done well. This rug should last a long time. Love the fact it's washable. Backing seems good and it stays put when walking on it. Overall a nice quality rug at a reasonable price.",
