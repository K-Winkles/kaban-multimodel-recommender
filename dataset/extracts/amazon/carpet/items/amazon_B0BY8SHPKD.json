Instead, they folded the lightweight rug 18 times creating an insane amount of wrinkles that I\u2019ll never be able to get out. On top of the wrinkled mess, beware these rugs should be marketed as big bath towels because they are only as thick as a beach towel. I intended to put these in my commercial office but like I said, they are way too thin and lightweight.",
