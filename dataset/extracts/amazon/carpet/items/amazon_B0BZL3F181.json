Our rugs have passed hundreds of repeated machine wash tests Is it going to fade after a long time of use? No, our rugs have been clear dried repeatedly without showing any signs of color loss. There are wrinkles when I open It, how do I remove them? Don't worry\uff01 it\u2019s normal as it was folded to travel across the world.Lay it flat on the floor for a few days and it should recover naturally. It helps much better to use a steam iron to iron the backing. Would it be easier to clean with a vacuum cleaner? Yes, it is very suitable, the vacuum cleaner will easily absorb the hair dust and the stains in the hair crevice. If it is dog urine, milk, wine and other liquid stains, just wipe it with a damp towel.",

                "reviewText": "Ordering a rug online is so difficult, it\u2019s hard to match colors and textures, etc. The coloring is pretty true to the pictures, so it matched very well. It came folded rather than rolled, so much less creasing and flattened within 1 day of use. I will say it is VERY thin, so it\u2019s definitely more for looks than comfort. If anything, it is not very comfortable to sit on if you\u2019re a floor sitter; but, this is perfect if you have pets and just needed to throw something down so they don\u2019t damage floors. Spills may go through it, though, so maybe consider a layer underneath or thicker rug if you are concerned. Very easy to clean, stains come right out so far. Overall, colors in pictures are accurate, shipped in a way that reduced any wrinkles or creasing in the rug, very thin material, very easy to set up and lightweight, and does not shift or slide because of material that allows good grip on the bottom (I didn\u2019t even need to use anything to keep it in place!). For the cost, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it.",
