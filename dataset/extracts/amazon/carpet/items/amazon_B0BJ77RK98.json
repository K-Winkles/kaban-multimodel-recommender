Cushy and soft, and so nice under bare feet.It looks like it might collect dirt and stuff, so it might need frequent cleaning, but I'm in love with this rug!So worth it!!!!!!",

I have it on tile and I would say the \"non-slip\" aspect needs to be improved upon. Part of the issue it is so lightweight that it moves too easily. It is priced well and as they say, you get what you pay for. I am using this in my laundry room and it fits my needs.",

When I opened the box, I discovered that the rug was shrink wrapped. When it was rolled out it was very wrinkled.Initially, I was not satisfied with the way it looked. However, the instructions stated that it would flatten out in 48 hours. I was very skeptical that anything would change. However, much to my surprise the rug did indeed flatten out. The rug looks great! I would buy another one.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a few of these rugs to put on my tile floor when my baby started crawling. They are soft and have a little bit of cushion with rubber on the underside to keep it from sliding. It has a synthetic smell when you first open it. I drape then over my banister to let them air out a bit before putting them down on the floor. It\u2019s all folded up and shrink wrapped when you get it but let it air out with the rug completely unfolded and all the bumps and wrinkles quickly come out. The rugs vary even though I got 3 of the same. Which is fine since they will only be down temporarily and are not for long term. The piling on the 3x5 size rug looks good and has a better, thicker quality about it, but the 4x6 rug\u2019s piling is significantly thinner and looks cheaply made and has that synthetic look about it. There\u2019s also an obvious color variation between the 4x6 and the 3x5 sized rugs even though I bought all the same color gray. Attached photo shows the variation in color and piling. I do need more rugs as my baby starts crawling further around the house, I\u2019ll just stick with the 3x5\u2019s since they seem to be more well made for the price. I wouldn\u2019t keep these around long term, they are not durable enough to last long term.",

It\u2019s very soft, thick, and comfortable to stand on. I purchased this rug for my bedroom, to put it along side of the bed. Our whole bedroom flooring is hard wood. So I wanted something soft to stand on whenever I got out of bed. Also, that my dogs could lay down on it and it would be soft and a little plush for them as well. I LOVE the fact that if it gets dirty, I can just put it in the washer easily to clean it. It\u2019s very light in weight to put in you washing machine. You just have to air dry it or put ur heat setting low so it doesn\u2019t ruin it. I definitely would recommend this rug.",

This is second right I bought off Amazon and they never tell you they are barely thicker than paper. Don\u2019t waste your money unless you buy a very thick pad to go with it. I knew as soon as I seen such a small package and then opened it and it was possible to shrink wrap a 4x6 \u201cshag\u201d rug that it has to be very thin. It\u2019s like walking on a cheap towel",
