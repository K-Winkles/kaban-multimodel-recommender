                "reviewText": "I have two little dogs who seem to think peeing on the rug is more fun than using their pee pads. Their bad dog bathroom habits forced me to toss the dreary fake wool rug I had as no amount of cleaning could entirely rid of the unpleasant odor, not to mention, the pee that inevitably seeped through to my hardwood floor. (Let me tell you, if I ever have to move, I can kiss my deposit goodbye.)So, I needed a new rug. I needed something to hide the unsightly permanent pee stains on my floor, but I also needed the kind of rug that might prevent further damage from happening. I needed something dog proof. Specifically, I needed a rug that was waterproof, stain resistant, ideally machine washable, in my color scheme, relatively fun and stylish, and affordable. (If only I'd set the bar this high on the dating apps.)After a seemingly endless Amazon search, I came across the Lahome Sun Print MACHINE WASHABLE area rug. Not only is it adorable, it fit my color scheme and, according to the description, checked off all the other boxes, too.The rug arrived a day earlier than the estimated delivery date, which is always a plus. Let me tell you something, from the get go, this rug did not disappoint, especially when my newest rescue pup wasted no time peeing on it, but here's the thing, the pee wasn't absorbed. As you can see from the first photo, the pee just kinda hovered atop the rug like a bubble. Nothing short of miraculous if you ask me. I had plenty of time to sop it up and clean the area. Easy peasy. (Part of me wanted her to pee on the rug again just so I could take a photo. Fortunately, she did the next day, hence, the photo.)A few days later, I wasn't so quick to notice she peed, but because the rug is waterproof, the pee didn't seep through to the hardwood floor. What a game changer. And being stain resistant, you can't even tell where my pup peed.I love this rug!Here are some other things you might want to know:*I have yet to machine wash the rug, but I'm pretty sure I'll need to take it to the laundry and throw it in one of the large capacity washers because I don't think my apartment building's standard washing machines, which have agitators, would be able to handle it, as the rug may be a bit too bulky. However, if you have a front loading machine without an agitator, my guess is it should be able to accommodate this rug. If it can fit in the box it came in, it very well can fit in your front loader.*You may not want to put it in a high trafficked area where people are going to trample on it a million times a day. As you can see from the second photo, the rug is in the center of my living room where most of it won't be walked on; except by the dogs. (This is their rug, after all.) The rug is light enough in color to get dirty quick. I mean, you can easily spot clean or machine wash, but I mean, who wants to do laundry everyday?*The rug is super soft. It'd be great in a baby's room. Not sure what the material is, but it kinda feels like a stuffed animal.*Depending on where you put it, you made need a little extra no-slippage. The rug says it's anti-slip--and it is--mostly. I have a coffee table on top of mine which keeps the rug from sliding.*You can easily sweep off loose debris, like crumbs and other stuff. I tried vacuuming the rug with my stick vac, but it just kind of sucked in the rug. Probably a good idea to just not wear shoes on this rug.All in all, so far, I am extremely happy with this rug. It's adorable, affordable, and best of all, dog proof. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:After less than 2 weeks of laying on the ground and being walked on, the rug has completely flattened out. That's just one of the perks of its pliability. The other one is how easy it is to fold and stow away! It's not very heavy and easy to transport.Now, you do need to know that you have to be VERY careful when vacuuming it! Because it is so light and pliable, it can't handle a lot of suction, much less a turning brush in the vacuum \"mouthpiece\" (the part that goes on the floor idk what it's called). I accidentally made what I think is a permanent mark in the fibers with the suction too high and the brush on. Must have ripped a line of fibers out clean. Thankfully, over time that \"scar\" has faded a lot and blends in with the temporary pressure marks that walking or placing heavy items on the rug will create. These pressure marks are basically just the white bottom of the fibers showing (only the top is dyed). Depending on how heavy the object was, they can be stubborn, but gently massaging the spots and everyday traffic will straighten the fibers back out. Personally, I'm going to refrain from permanently placing heavy objects on the rug (like the feet of a chair for example).Another thing: The fibers are kind of clingy when it comes to organic dirt, like small particles of wood, leaves, seeds or the like. That combined with how sensitive the rug is to vacuums, it is kind of tricky to get clean. Thankfully the overall texture of the rug makes it to where that doesn't take away too much from the visual appeal.For the above reasons, not upgrading to 5 stars. But it's a solid four, good price for a very nice product.ORIGINAL REVIEW:giving a somewhat cautious 4 stars because I only just unpacked it.Pros so far: As other reviews have stated, it's very soft to the touch! The colors are warm and vibrant, just as pictured. Being a young and idealistic first time mom who wanted this for the nursery, right now I'm happy to deal with whatever cons there are just for those reasons.Observation: The rug is relatively thin and very pliable. I saw another review likening it to a towel. Not quite, but it's definitely not comparable to the sturdy stuff that you would usually expect. This makes complete sense though. After all, the idea is for it to fit into a washing machine with relative ease. I personally don't find that it makes the rug feel or look cheap.Cons so far: It came folded and tightly packed in a plastic bag, rather than rolled, so there are visible creases everywhere and it doesn't lie 100% flat. I'll give it 2 weeks as the manufacturer suggests and hopefully by then it'll have evened itself out.The rug has a tag on it that says \"machine washable\" and shows the washing machine symbol with 40 degrees. The first thing it tells you though is to hand wash it in warm water. That makes machine washing look like a plan B to me. Given that the rug is explicitly advertised machine washable I was really hoping for a little more detail (and confidence) on the washing instructions!I'm debating whether I should run it through the wash and dry it flat on the floor if the creases haven't disappeared in two weeks or whether I should wait until it's absolutely necessary in case the thing unravels completely. At least that way I'll get some use out of it.Will update this review and post pictures as things unfold (literally and figuratively).",

It doesn\u2019t slip around too bad on my hard wood floors. In the downside, it does show literally everything. I don\u2019t allow anything but water in the living room and it\u2019s somehow so dirty looking pretty quickly. But I expect that with the lighter colors on it. You can also tell the print was printed on and not made with that color of fibers because you can see white through the colors and they aren\u2019t super vibrant. But it was so cheap so I can\u2019t be too mad at that.It is not stain resistant. I\u2019ve washed it and the white part still holds on to everything.",
