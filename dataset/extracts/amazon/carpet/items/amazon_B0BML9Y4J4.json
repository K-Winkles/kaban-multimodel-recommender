If you run or jump on the carpet in socks, it may be a little slippery. Our area rugs have thickened interlining in the middle. Washing is OK, but it is not recommended to dry them. When drying, the interlining and the upper and lower layers of materials will be unglued, so machine washing is not recommended.",

The feel is soft on the feet without having deep pile, which is safer to walk on.",
