                "reviewText": "I love this rug! It's washable, so it is not a plush rug, if that's what you're looking for. The rug has a rubber backing so it does not slip unless pulled. I have it on a vinyl tile floor and I don't see the need for padding unless you want a cushion feel. I might buy a grip for the corner, only because it's located in a high traffic area. The material seems like good quality and appears more expensive than what I paid.It comes folded in a box, which was expected. The photos were taken right after I placed it on the floor, and there are barely any creases. I'm not sure if it washes well, but I'm assuming it will because of the material.I was a little worried about buying a light colored rug, but the colors could easily conceal light dirt in between washes.Update as of 10/28/23... I washed the rug. It fit in my top loader washing machine; however, I washed it twice to make sure it was clean between the folds. I hung it up on a partition in my living room and let it air dry. There were barely and wrinkles and it laid flat on the floor afterwards. I added three extra photos.",

                "reviewText": "Our chairs were scratching the wood despite having the felt bottoms attached so I began looking for a rug. With the space it had to be a lighter rug, and with kids it had to be washable. This was not even a option for us. Most rugs I found at 8ft were incredibly expensive and out of price range. I came across this one and ordered it PRAYING it was going to work. It came a bit wrinkled but according to the instructions it was going to smooth out on its own. A few days later it lays completely flat. It\u2019s beautiful! I had to do the big test of what will it look like when my children knock over their cups. It repelled the water and nothing seeped through to my floor. HUGE WIN! I was able to blot off the excess water and leave it to dry with zero moisture sitting on my wood floors. It did take a little while to dry, but this didn\u2019t bother me more than it would having to remove this massive rug for every single spill. This morning I noticed there was some red hot sauce that had been dropped on the rug, I know we had not had anything like that for at least 4 days. I grabbed a wet sponge (no soap) and started rubbing the stain out effortlessly. I am SOLD! I can\u2019t imagine what it will do in the washer. An added bonus I found is the rubber backing. I didn\u2019t want a rug pad under my table for multiple reasons, mainly because of the chairs. It stays in place on its own and I love it. It\u2019s VERY this but so soft under foot. I got the matching 8x10 for my living room but I did get a rug pad as I want a cushioned feel for a more cozy area. I will undoubtedly be getting more when I can afford to. Over all, yes! I really wanted a ruggable or tumble rug but now I\u2019m wondering why I would ever pay those prices when this has been exactly what I was looking for and half the cost. This is not paid, I just really like my rug. I want to see these types of reviews before I make purchases.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my laundry room, as it's the cut through from the garage to the rest of the house and I was sick of tracking in dirt/dust.The 2' x 5' size is perfect for my space, and I've put it down on laminate. It doesn't slide around excessively, but moves easy enough if you want to readjust it.Really my only gripe about this is that it's not really a rug. It's more of a rug-look mat. Which is fine for this! But if you are looking for a higher pile/plush rug this is not for you. It does say thin in the title after all, but really I'd still be more inclined to call it a mat.Anyway, still pretty good quality! It was folded rather than rolled, and there were a few creases but the ends were never curled. It seems to have the creases mostly out already after a few days of light traffic. I haven't tried to vacuum it yet, but if it is difficult to vacuum, I'll probably just shake it off outside, as I can't imagine too much will be able to get embedded given the low pile.Definitely worth it for the low price :)",

I actually was able to put the 5x7 in my front loader. It held up pretty well. I probably would not do that again as some threads did unravel (minor), however it was a lesson learned about the high traffic. Now I make sure everyone walks on the runner around the rug.Just a small complaint...the color was a little more blue than I thought. For some reason I thought it was a baby blue/Carolina blue from the pictures. It actually is a darker blue, but it still works.The rug unfolded very well with minimal wrinkles. I have been super impressed thus far with the purchase. It is so soft I would let my younger nieces and nephews crawl on it.All in all, this was a great purchase. If you are looking for an eye catching piece that is equally soft, then this rug would work. I would definitely buy this again if I had the space.",
