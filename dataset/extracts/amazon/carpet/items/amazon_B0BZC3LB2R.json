                "reviewText": "This rug gets 5 stars from me in every dept. The quality is very durable and the edging is done very well. It has a very low profile pile so it's perfect for a foyer or entry way where a door opening needs clearance so as not to catch the rug. It lays flat, doesn't bunch up or shift, which was a huge factor for me as I use a wheelchair. It's super light weight but heavy enough to stay in place. Easy to wash and fits in my small portable clothes washer. The colors are true to advertising and look great. I'm definitely going to purchase more for other areas of my home!",

The rug allows for the placement of wet shoes or boots while protecting the floor. I am very pleased with the purchase but it is thin and I don't think it is something I would recommend for a lot of foot traffic. I haven't tried to clean it yet but I assume I could just shake out any residual dirt or dust.",

                "reviewText": "The very attractive Oriental motif of this rug is let down by the color choice and the way the rug is made. It looks nice from a distance but within about 15 feet it looks incredibly cheap. This is mostly because of the colors, especially the weird orange and the white background which should be cream/off-white, but also because of the way the rug is made and its materials. It has a very short nap with obvious tufts. Sort of like cheap doll hair?I have other inexpensive washable Oriental motif rugs made by other companies that are better overall than this one. Those other rugs are flat woven and generally feel much higher quality. Obviously none of them are anything like real Oriental rugs, but sometimes you want something you don\u2019t mind if it gets trashed.I did not return this rug as it is a slightly hard to find size that fits perfectly in its spot. But I won\u2019t be sad when it needs to be replaced and I will not buy this one again.",
