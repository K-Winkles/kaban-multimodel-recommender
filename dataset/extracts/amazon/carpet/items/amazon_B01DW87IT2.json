Place the front legs of your sofa on top of the rug or have all four legs rest on the rug To have furniture framed in the center of a large room, we recommend a 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 or larger rug.

                "reviewText": "Overall happy with the rug. It is pretty thin but what do you expect for a cheaper priced area rug. It came in rolled but towards the end there was some folds. I put weights down on the edges which seem to work and for the folds in the middle I used my dogs bed and kept it on top for close to a week but it didn\u2019t help too much. You can\u2019t really tell unless you analyze the rug though. The rug looks great for the price. If you look from one side it\u2019s lighter and then darker on the other. It looks great for white, grey, black themed living rooms though. It is pretty thin but soft. I\u2019m sure a rug pad will be a good fix. I would recommend this rug for anyone looking for a rug that doesn\u2019t break the bank",

It hides dog hair and the inevitable spills or stains from 2 young kids.It was super wonky after being unrolled the first time, but after a week the rug \"relaxed\" and laid flat. Other reviews complained about this, but it's normal for a rug to be wrinkled at first.I'd did shed a lot in the first vacuum, but seems fine now.For the price, this was a great option for us.",
