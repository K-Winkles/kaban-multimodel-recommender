                "reviewText": "This is one of those modern washable rugs that is short cropped, soft, and gentle on the feet. It feels like you're walking on a close cropped soft velvet. The design is dyed on the top of white fiber. The edges are finished nicely. The backing is TPR (Thermoplastic Rubber), like on the back of a bath mat. Seems to stick better to the floor and not move around as much as our traditional rugs that require carpet tape to keep them in position. I do however have a piece of furniture anchoring it. If this rug was without an anchor it may need carpet tape to stay in position too. I didn't feel the need to air this outside, it doesn't have the odor like a new traditional rug. Looking up TPR at several sites online it appears to be safe and not need airing, but do your own research to feel comfortable.The roomba works fine on it and glides on and off the rug easily. At 5x7 this area rug is too big to go in my washing machine but would maybe fit in those huge ones at the laundromat. The backing would melt in the dryer so for me it's probably best to hang it on a fence and hose it off and then let it line dry. That being said, the rug is so close cropped that depending upon the amount of foot traffic, with regular roomba visits, I doubt it will get dirty enough to need laundering until spring cleaning.The design of this rug is the best of both worlds. It's neutral color palette goes with our decor but it's far from boring. It's a vibrant appealing rug that uplifts the space. I got this to go in a loft bedroom to brighten the room up and it definitely does the job. However, it's so dynamic that I'm thinking about moving it to the dining room where it would look amazing under the dining room table. We keep our table leaves out unless entertaining and at 5'x7' it frames the table nicely. It will probably service both rooms depending upon the occasion.",

                "reviewText": "The rug came as advertised, and the colors and style matched perfectly to the advertisement images. That was important, as many times I have ordered rugs that looked one way online, and a different way when I opened the package. This rug was a perfect match! The size was cut well and it was totally sized straight with good right angles, you would be surprised how many rugs are cut at bad angles or sewn incorrectly, none of those issues here.The quality is excellent, way better than I would have expected, especially due to the value price point. This feels and looks like a more expensive piece. The fabric is very soft and has a great texture to it. I imagined a rug for a high traffic area, but now I am rethinking it lol. This could be something I would wouldn't even mind playing around with the pets on. The padding is OK, its not thick, but this type of rug is not meant to have a thick pad. However, it does provide some insulation from the floor and its comfortable to stand and walk on.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who needs a soft, value priced rug, that will provide a comfortable place to walk and sit on for what ever purpose you need it. Excellent product, Five Stars!",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered the \"LikeMart Washable Area Rug 5x7 - Large Boho Area Rug for Living Room Vintage Bohemian Throw Rugs with Non Slip TPR Backing Faux Wool Soft Neutral Rug Floor Carpet Rugs for Bedroom Dining Room Dorm\" because I loved the pattern and wanted something kind of \"classic but new\" looking. I really could not be more pleased with it.This rug is so soft, especially considering it isn't billed as being particularly plush, but after ordering a few rugs with very similar descriptions over the years, I've learned that when a rug is priced really well, it's probably because it's paper thin! This one is NOT and I love it. It does not feel like a mat (as many of the thin rugs I've owned have felt), but instead has a much more luxurious softness - or as one of my friends said, \"It's full of cushiness!\" Who knew faux sheep made such soft faux wool?!At the time of this review, this rug is listed with a 17% discounted price of $49.98 (regularly $59.98) and I feel it is well worth that price. I definitely recommend. My only complaint is that I can't seem to find any larger rugs by this company and I would really love either an 8x10 or even a 10x12 just like this one.",

I was impressed that the creases are minor and an hour later, as I\u2019m writing this, the creases are even less. I\u2019m going to put books on one edge to flatten it, but the other edge is already completely flat. I\u2019m really impressed with the quality. It\u2019s a washable rug so it\u2019s not super plush or a shag, but it\u2019s very soft to the touch. I love the colors. They are exactly as depicted.",

It comes folded up for shipping purposes but once unfolded and laid down the creases will just disappear in no time. It's a beautiful design and has great neutral colors that will work with almost any decor. Very beautiful and classy rug that looks more expensive than it is. The rug is buttery soft with a velvety feel to it. The entire back of this rug is nonslip and it stays perfectly in place. I used this rug beside the bed in a guest bedroom that has hardwood floors and it fits the length of the full sized bed perfectly. I love that it's fully washable and it can be spot cleaned when needed as well. It's a very low pile rug that vacuums easily without being sucked up into the vacuum too. Overall this is a great quality rug that looks amazing and is easy to maintain. Highly recommend!",
