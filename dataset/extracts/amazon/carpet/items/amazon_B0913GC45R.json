                "reviewText": "While this mat from Alpcour is advertised as a bike trainer mat, many of its properties -- water resistance, noise reducing, and non-slip -- make it also well-suited to entrance ways and foyers. I am actually using this as a mat to park my bike (that I take outside) on, to help protect the floor from dirt and water. This is wide and long enough for my bike, and it does indeed seem to be water resistant. It has some give to it -- my bike will leave indentations in the material, though it does seem to bounce back after a bit.My main complaint is that the edges are still a bit curled from unpacking, even after 5 days. Hopefully it will flatten out after a few more days. This also had a slight rubbery odor to it after initially unpacking it, though that went away after about a day.The mat fulfills its description at a reasonable price, so I'm giving it 5 stars for now.",
