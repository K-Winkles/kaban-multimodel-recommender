                "reviewText": "Like the previous reviewer, I purchased this rug without seeing any reviews. I liked the color - the green goes well with my retro-gold sitting room. (It's bright green but surprisingly that color goes with a lot of other colors.) I have an area on my carpet where the dogs tend to camp out and eat their treats, so I have had a remnant on that spot, time to replace it, I have had a similar rug to this one in gray for years but after washing it many times it was time to replace it as well. This rug looks like it's not going to work when you get it; it's seriously shrink wrapped. But it's been 12 hours and it is now sitting properly, maybe one or two stubborn lumps but they are going away. I would say the pile is \"mid\" long. My gray one had a longer pile, but this one is long enough to make the rug fluffy but not shaggy. It's soft, mine didn't have an odor, and what I really like is it's not sliding around on top of the carpeting beneath. My purpose it to create an area for my boney greyhounds to camp out - they immediately got on the rug and loved it. There are tons of these rugs on Amazon - they are almost impossible to vacuum so I've taken mine outside and hit it with the leaf blower. I am hoping this mid-pile rug might be more vacuum friendly. If you are unfamiliar with these types of rugs, they don't have a traditional stiff backing. They are about as thick as a comforter. If you're looking for a sturdy, traditional area rug - this is not it. But if you are looking for a cozy accent rug, nice color and quality, this is it. I am very pleased with it, but I knew what to expect.",

                "reviewText": "I never order anything without a review so I\u2019ll be the first to review it. I wanted to take a risk with this one because it was the cheapest rug I could find and to be honest it\u2019s great. Out of all the other rugs I looked at this one is actually pretty decent. It\u2019s really soft and has a good little cushion and I love the color. if you\u2019re looking for something cheap but still good quality I\u2019d suggest getting this. The only warning I give you is that it has a really strong weird smell when you first open it you just have to let that room air out for a little while. And now there\u2019s at least one review for you to know it\u2019s worth buying:)",
