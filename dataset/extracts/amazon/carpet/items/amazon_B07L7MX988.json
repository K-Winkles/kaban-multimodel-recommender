                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Purchased this to put down as a layer inside our camping tent. It\u2019s bright, fun & will make the tent cozier. This rug arrived in a vacuumed packed bag and was fully compressed like a brick. After unpacking, it had folds & creases as expected but after shaking it out a few times & laying it flat, the creases are diminishing. I may put it in the dryer on fluff or very low heat to help it along. This rug is not too thick & verylight weight which is what I wanted., so it takes up less room when we pack up our camping gear & it doesn\u2019t add much poundage to the RV or tow vehicle. The fibers are very soft & silky almost like an infants plush toy. It sheds a little but not excessively. I wouldn\u2019t lay on it with dark clothing tho for sure. It feels nice on bare feet but it does flatten out a bit in spots when you walk on it. So it\u2019s more of an accent rug or layer like I will use it in my camping tent. Not meant for traffic areas or as main carpeting. It shakes out very easy & then fluffs up again. The only way I can describe the backing is ,it is like a bed quilt or thin soft padding with a slight coating & tiny rubber dots that help it to not slide too much. It has a nice sewn fabric edge border which gives it more substance & strength. Upon opening the plastic packaging I noticed a slight smell like kids acrylic paint but it wasn\u2019t bothersome. I\u2019ll have to look up how to clean or wash it because it did not come with any paper insert or manufacturers tags at all\u2026 Overall a cute fun accent piece. Looking forward to glamping with it! True to its description & size. The color is like a celery green. I will update later about it\u2019s longevity & how it holds up if it needs to be cleaned.",
