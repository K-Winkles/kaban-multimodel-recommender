The front of the rug should rest a few inches in front of your sofa. If you are placing the rug under a coffee table, make sure that it can accommodate all four legs of the table. Larger rooms typically require a rug that is between 6\u2019 x 9\u2019 - 8\u2019 x 10\u2019. Place the front legs of the sofa on top of the rug. If you prefer, all four legs may also rest completely on the rug surface. Leaving a space of 18\"-24\" on all sides of the rug will create a border to frame your living space. If your current set up features furniture floating in the center of the room, we recommend at least a 9\u2019 x 12\u2019. An equal amount of floor space (between 12\u201d - 18\u201d) should be left on all sides if possible. All furniture should sit completely on the rug surface without looking cramped.",

My dog still has accidents sometimes so I didn't need a quality expensive rug. This rug is beautiful and soft, but it is very thin. It is slowly flattening itself but when I first unrolled it wouldn't lay flat at all. As you can see from the photo the corners are still kind of lifting after 24hrs but this is low traffic area. I think with time it will eventually flatten. Great for the price and what I needed it for.",

On one we just renovated we saw this on Amazon, it looked good, and the price was like buying locally. We got it on Prime and once de3livered and put down we were thrilled. It looks better materially than most rugs of this material, has a contemporary style, and we are extremely pleased. Buying something sight unseen is always a risk, but I highly recommend this rug.",
