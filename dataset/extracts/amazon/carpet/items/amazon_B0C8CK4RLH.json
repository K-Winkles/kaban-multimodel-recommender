We love these rugs for our children\u2019s rooms because they\u2019re soft and fluffy. The grey is a bit more of a blue grey, so be careful with that.Overall, it\u2019s a great rug for a playroom, bedroom or basement!",

Good tacky backing to prevent slips, and a good thickness of padding. The synthetic material seems a bit slick, but not really a down side. No shedding spotted yet.Only downside is the rug could use some instructions on cleaning on the package other than \"Easy to clean\".",
