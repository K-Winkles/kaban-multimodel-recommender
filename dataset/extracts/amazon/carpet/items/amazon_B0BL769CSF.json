It was easy to wash and dry at home and my dog loved it. But it stated to come apart so looked for rugs on Amazon and chose this one. As I said, it is extremely soft. Has good backing so it doesn\u2019t slide around. And, yes, the pooch of the house loves it too. I think it would be great next to a bed as you got out of bed. Rey nice. One not\u2026I haven\u2019t noticed any dirt stains, or any other kinds of stains, so I didn\u2019t answer that question. If it doesn\u2019t clean easily, I will come back to edit this. Meanwhile, I like this rug.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m genuinely surprised by its quality. Usually something like this I need to see and feel it before I buy it, but I couldn\u2019t find anything to go with the vibe with my house so I took a chance and trusted the reviews.My first worry was that it was going to look cheap like printed.. it does not. It\u2019s better looking than most of the target and Lowe\u2019s rugs I looked at.My second worry was thickness, because some reviews said it was like a thick blanket rather than a rug.. it\u2019s not. It has that rug back that you\u2019d expect, but the top IS so soft like a blanket.My final concern was vacuuming. I have a large dog that sheds so I have to vacuum my wood floors and carpet. I have a very strong vacuum and it does not suck up the rug. Thank goodness. It is so easy to clean.Yes it oddly comes in a box, but the folding lines went away the next day.The only thing I would warn about is that it is slippery because of how soft it his. I\u2019ve had no issue but my husband keeps wiping out somehow lolI\u2019m very happy with it and do recommend",

BUT this rug is the softest rug ever. It is like heaven under your feet. I lay on it sometimes just because it's that soft. My kids are obsessed with it, in fact so much, they are very careful to not wear shoes or have food and drinks near it. It is very hard to vacuum but manageable. I forgot to order a anti-slip grip mat for under it and figured I would just order one after getting it if needed but turns out it doesn't slide on hard floors at all! I would give this rug 10 stars if I could!",
