However, within 2 days it becomes thick and soft. Bonus for having a non-slip bottom on it as well which saves you money over other budget rugs by not having to buy a rug pad. Instructions also state it is machine washable but I haven't tested that yet. I told my wife we should order an extra for when this one wears out because we like it so much. I wish they made larger sizes! Would love an 8x10 just like this.",

I can imagine a little one crawling around, drooling, rolling over on this rug. I wish I had this when I was having babies. However, I am old now and needed a wall-to-wall rug in my bathroom that wouldn't slip. I needed to cut it to size obviously to fit around the toilet, floor vent, etc. It was very easy to cut with regular scissors. It does shed a bit along the cut edges after cutting, but I vacummed and then ran a sticky roller over the edges to pick up any fluff.",
