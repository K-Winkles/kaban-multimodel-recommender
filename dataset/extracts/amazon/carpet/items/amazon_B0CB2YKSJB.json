I was excited when purchasing to learn that it\u2019s machine washable, our previous runner was becoming too much work to take it to be professionally cleaned from time to time. This will save time and money for sure!When I first unboxed it the rug had creases from being folded, but those flattened out within a few hours without me needing to steam it or anything. It lays out beautifully.I messaged the seller with questions and they responded quickly and very kindly, so I look forward to giving them my business again in the future.",

It looks more brownish in the description pictures, which is what I wanted. I have attached a couple of my own pictures so you can see what I mean. But it still works fine with my kitchen colors and it\u2019s really soft. I did add a 1/4\u201d pad underneath, however. The most important part of this rug is that it\u2019s washable, seeing as it\u2019s in the kitchen and near the sink and stove. Just by looking at it and feeling it I\u2019m somewhat skeptical how well it washes and if the colors/design stays on. But other reviewers have said it washes just fine, so I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s the case! I\u2019ll update my review if things go amiss in the wash!",

                "reviewText": "This rug is a good rug for the cost of it. It comes folded, so beware of that. You have to unfold it and lay it out. (There are some perpetual folds along the edges, as a result.) The colors are nice, and the rug is very soft\u2014even after multiple washings. The rug did shrink a small amount after the first washing, and thus lays a little differently than at first, but it still looks great. I have washed the rug twice now, and it is so easy to just pop it into the washer\u2019 despite it being a 10\u2019 rug, it is thin enough to fit easily into the machine. I am pleased with my purchase.",

I didn't have high hopes for quality, but these far exceeded my expectations. The material is super soft on these rugs. The colors are true to the pics. I wish they were a little bit wider, but thats my only personal choice. They are truly great.",

It did come with some creases, but I think a couple days will flatten it out. The print is beautiful\u2014 I\u2019m very pleased! My 2 x 7 took 2 1/2 weeks to come in the mail, which was a disappointment.",
