Designer Tip: Place your sofa or club chairs at the very edge of the rug with legs off to maintain stabilization and avoid a cluttered look and feel. To accommodate a mid- to large-size living room, an 8\u2019 x 10\u2019 rug is the most popular room layout with maximum comfort underfoot to add proportion and balance. Designer Tip: Place the front legs of your sofa or club chair on the outer edges of the rug to maintain stabilization and avoid a cluttered look and feel. For a large room, showcase a stunning 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 or 10\u2019 x 14\u2019 area rug to make a grand statement in a living space designed for luxurious entertainment gatherings.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Ivory: beautiful, soft, and durable",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the ivory color of this rug and am pleased that it is a true, rich ivory. Not stark white, and no yellow undertone. It shipped very quickly (although I have Prime) and was delivered two days earlier than was originally predicted, which was a nice surprise. The rug came tightly wrapped in thick, high quality plastic that was sealed with plenty of tape to prevent any dampness or damage from occurring.When I first unrolled the carpet, the fibers were quite compressed but only due to the storage and shipping method for it. All it took was a quick pass of my foot or hand to lift the fibers up and they were immediately plush. Like many of the reviewers here, I was pleasantly surprised by the softness of this area rug! It feels SO nice under foot. My kindergartner has enjoyed feeling it under his toes, and my elderly Labrador dog adores tucking herself onto this carpet in the evenings. I can tell she is comfortable.I had serious reservations about buying this rug ONLY because I worried that I couldn't use my current vacuum on it for free of ripping the fibers. I asked a question on this page, several people responded, and I ultimately took the risk and bought it. I babied it along for the first couple weeks, but then my dog conveniently provided the test we needed: she got into a small bag of maple flavored specialty ground coffee while we were sleeping and ripped it apart all over the middle of the carpet. Wake to the smell of intense coffee...AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A TAN STAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BRAND NEW CARPET. Ahhh!!!! I was able to part the fibers with my fingers to use a vacuum attachment to pull the grounds out of the carpet---worked great. Final test...I grudgingly decided to try to vacuum WITH the beater-bar turned on, and it was GREAT! (I have a Dyson Ball Animal.) The vacuum helped lift what remained out of the fibers and did not provide any damage. Because of the plush pile, it takes a few extra passes in different directions to ensure the fibers have been sufficiently cleaned, but that's the only challenge of using a regular vacuum. I was able to treat the carpet, too, with a commercial grade foam cleaner to help lift the tan stain of the coffee off the fibers, and it released without issue. The carpet was saved, and now there's no evidence that there had been an issue in the first place.I try to vacuum this area rug every 3-4 days to ensure no grim can build up on it. I took a risk ordering ivory but so badly wanted to brighten up our living room of our 1850 home. This is a high traffic room with two adults, one child, one dog, and one cat. It's been holding up fine, however.My last pleasant surprise is to realize the carpet has provided significant insulation over top our old hardwood floors. We live along the Canadian border in extremely cold temperatures in an old, drafty house. The rug has provided a great deal more warmth this winter than our old, low pile area rug ever could have. It has been a welcomed change in the depths of 25 below temperatures.Ultimately, this is a wonderful area rug that feels far richer than the price I paid for it. I have never purchased this brand before but will gladly do so in the future when my next need arises.",

                "reviewText": "The rug is a little thinner and not as soft as I had hoped for/thought it would be, according to the attached description of the rug. I came to the reviews to read, before buying, just to see if someone talked about the thin/thickness of the rug. No one did, so I hope this can help someone.You can see above, in one of my attached photos, that you can actually see the hardwood flooring through the rug when split with my fingers. However to stop this (and to also make it a softer rug), I put a 1/4\u201d felt pad down first. This seemed to stop both of these problems making it not see thru and a lot softer to walk/sit/play on. I kind of wished I\u2019d bought a thicker felt pad (such as a 1/2\u201d) but I didn\u2019t want to have to \u201cstep\u201d up onto my rug. I just wanted my feet to be able to glide onto the rug (hope that makes sense). Other then it being a little thin and not as soft as I\u2019d hoped for, the rug itself is beautiful.I bought it In jet black for my black, silver, pink/coral, and white room. It is a very beautiful pure jet black. As you can see in a couple of the attached photos, there is a beautiful sheen to the color. That is what I was hoping for. It just shines and glistens in the light/sun.The back of the rug is quite scratchy and may scratch your wood/bamboo flooring so make sure you buy a felt pad to put against your hardwood/bamboo first. Also, the scratchy surface will make it very slippery on your hardwood/bamboo. Make sure you buy a felt pad for underneath and also the grippers for either underneath or to attach to the corners as to help it from sliding across your floor when stepped/walked on.I was worried, because it\u2019s black, that it\u2019d show every little paper/hair/lint that got dropped onto it, but it don\u2019t. I\u2019m switching from a white rug to this black rug and as dirty as my white rug got, I\u2019m hoping this one stays a lot cleaner. So far, so good.This is a terrific brand of rugs. I have now 4 of this branded rugs in my home. It\u2019s the only brand I\u2019ll buy moving forward. My two little rugs (not like this, but rag rugs) I throw into the washer and dryer and they come out looking brand new. (Please don\u2019t put this specific rug in the washer/dryer as it would ruin the bottom of the rug and probably your washer/dryer. I\u2019m trying to point out that this company puts out quality rugs, by my example of the washing/drying process of the smaller rag rugs.)This company can\u2019t be beat for the price! If you were to buy this rug in a store, you\u2019d pay at least double. The shipping took a little longer then I had hoped for, but it did finally get to me. The felt pad came 4 days before the rug so waiting for the rug to come seemed like it took longer then it really did because I wanted to put it all down at the same time. But it all worked out in the end. I just practiced patience. The delivery was smooth. The rug got to me rolled up and protected by it being wrapped in 3 different layers of plastic. There was no damage to the rug.I can\u2019t comment on the return process because I\u2019m keeping the rug I received. The quality of the rug is beautiful and (I feel) very cost effective for the price I paid.(I hope this review can help someone. If it helped you, please select the \u201chelpful\u201d icon and let me know. Thank you!)",

                "reviewText": "The light sage rug I received looks more like mint, but it still fits nicely into my color scheme. A deep pile makes this comfortable underfoot, and adding a non-slip mat anchors it to the hardwood floor. A few passes in different directions with my vacuum keeps it tidy, although it will need a shampoo occasionally since my pup has adopted it as one of her beds. I'll update how the shampoo process went.",

                "reviewText": "I never bought a rug on-line before and I had lots of reservations but I was truly surprised. The color was true to the picture and the quality is impressive. It's very thick and plush and feels like heaven when you walk on it. The first thing my daughter said was that you wanted to lay down and take a nap on it. I also really like that you don't leave \"walk marks\" on it and it vacuums up beautifully. I have a 5x7 laying on hard wood floors so without something under it, it will move about somewhat with traffic. BTW, I liked it so much I bought a matching runner.",
