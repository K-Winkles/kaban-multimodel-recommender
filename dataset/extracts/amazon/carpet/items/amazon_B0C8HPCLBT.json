            "\u3010ULTRA SOFT PLUSH SURFACE\u3011These dorm room rug feature a 1.6'' plush surface, bringing you a cozy and luxurious feeling. Made from hypoallergenic material, these soft faux fur rugs are skin-friendly, and perfect for tummy time with your baby.",

            "\u3010AIRTIGHT PACKAGING\u3011Since these plush area rug come with airtight packing, the foam interlayer might need 2 to 3 days to recover to its original thickness. And there might be some creases on the bottom, a garment steamer could help to flatten the creases much quicker.",

Thankfully it cleaned up great. It\u2019s hard to vacuum it with my shark, basically I do it without the beater bar on.",
