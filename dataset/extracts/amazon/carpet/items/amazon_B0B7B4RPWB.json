It comes folded in, therefore, as fold seams that will take several weeks to work out. It is relatively nonslip.

                "reviewText": "I love my new rug. It\u2019s an 8x10 and extremely soft. This is the second rug I purchased because the first one was so nice in blues and aqua. This one doesn\u2019t not appear to be as thick as the previous one. But I\u2019ll let it air up and see if it gets fluffier. It takes a few days to relax and lay flat, but it will (from experience). My only regret is it is not the soft pale pink and gray in the photo. The center gray is much darker, almost black, and the pink is more a salmon pink. Still, it goes with my pink accents rather well so I like it very much.",

                "reviewText": "I waited until I washed it to review. I use this in a high traffic kitchen/entryway. It is thin and migrates a bit on my tile so it could benefit from a rug pad, but it stays well enough and I like the thinness because that means it fits in a washing machine and doesn\u2019t impede the clearance of the door. It washed extremely well in my smaller than average top load washer. To wash, I let it agitate with detergent in warm water for a few minutes, then let it soak for about 40 min before finishing since it was really soiled from dirty paws and some oil spots. It came out looking and feeling brand new. It did shrink a couple inches, I think because I used warm water and tumble dried on medium instead of low. But it still fits the space well and I don\u2019t mind the shrinkage. I would recommend this rug.",

In a time in my life when a washable rug in a family space feels like a blessing but way out of budget I found this! I haven\u2019t washed it that is the only reason I didn\u2019t give it the full five stars\u2026.yet!It was shipped open, delivered with care, came folded in a smaller box. After others reviews/photos I was worried about creases. However, I just slipped it over my stair railing and the creases fell out in a day.It is large, a bit heavy but thin (but being a washable I expected that) it still feels nice to walk on (not like a high pile rug, no toes swishing here but still nice), & grips the floor with minimal movement.But what really got me was how beautiful and vibrate the colors are\u2026 it totally changed the vibe of the space in a good way\u2026.more in a boho chic not in a modern way.",
