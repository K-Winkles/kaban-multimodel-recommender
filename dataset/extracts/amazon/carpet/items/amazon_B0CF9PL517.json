                "reviewText": "So, this rug is not the nicest looking, but it's exceptionally soft on your feet. But it's a little less nice looking in person than in the pics. The faux distressing just gives it kind of a cheap look, it's kind of airport-ish or hotel lobby. That said, if you want something that's suuuuuuper soft and fuzzy, it's a winner. My 8-year-old niece even remarked out of nowhere about how soft it was when she stepped on it, if that gives you a sense of how unusually soft it is for an inexpensive rug. If you\u2019re looking for something that will make you want to step out of bed in the morning and don\u2019t care what it looks like, this is the one.",

                "reviewText": "This rug is SO SOFT. It's pretty thin and also washable which is nice because I have it at my back door. My oldest kid likes to run up to it and slide across it, so I guess it's also a little slippery. It comes folded in a bag, but it will flatten out nicely after a couple of days. I like the simple colors and pattern because it doesn't stand out too much. This makes a really good entry way rug for us, but it would also be good in a short hallway.",
