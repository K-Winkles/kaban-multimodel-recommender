Designer Tip: Place your sofa or club chairs at the very edge of the rug with legs off to maintain stabilization and avoid a cluttered look and feel. To accommodate a mid- to large-size living room, an 8\u2019 x 10\u2019 rug is the most popular room layout with maximum comfort underfoot to add proportion and balance. Designer Tip: Place the front legs of your sofa or club chair on the outer edges of the rug to maintain stabilization and avoid a cluttered look and feel. For a large room, showcase a stunning 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 or 10\u2019 x 14\u2019 area rug to make a grand statement in a living space designed for luxurious entertainment gatherings. Designer Tip: Place your sofa, sectional, or club chairs with all legs on top of the rug for a much more \u201cpulled-together\u201d look and feel in large spaces.",

Designer Tip: Ensure placement allows a minimum of 18\u201d of bare floor from the edge of the rug to any wall. For a bedroom, a 5\u2019 x 8\u2019 rug is ideal for a full or twin size bed, and an 8\u2019 x 10\u2019 or 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 rug works well with a king or queen size bed.

They were well packed with desiccant packets and did not have any smell of mildew only the faint smell of wool which confirmed that they were authentic wool rugs. The wool smell was gone after the first day. The little amount of shedding when vacuumed was explained on the packaging as normal and the rugs are still very thick and beautiful. They are very well made and lay flat. I love the deep, rich, shades of green.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased three SAFAVIEH wool rugs from the antiquity collection. All are the same pattern.. I gave a 6'x6' one as a gift. I bought a 7'6\" x 9'6\" for my family room and after five years I just decided I should have purchased the 9'x12' size. So I did! I will gift the replaced rug. SO - that's how much I love the quality and pattern of this rug. The Amazon premium delivery for $29.99 was worth it! The 2-person team was prompt, professional, gracious, and helpful. They put the rug right where I wanted it, and offered to move it if that didn't look right. I am very happy.ADVICE: If you buy a SAFAVIEH wool rug you need to change your vacuum, bag OFTEN for the first several times over it. The shedding is not apparent (to me) on the rug, but the accumulation of wool in the vacuum is significant for a while.",

It\u2019s soft under foot, vacuums easily and looks as good as the photos advertising it.Like all new wool rugs, it sheds a lot at first but now it\u2019s done after a few months, and there is still a lot of it left! Not to worry, even though it seems like too much shedding, this rug has lots of yarn; it\u2019s edges are well finished and the rug was pretty true to size.",

No. Will it cover your whole house in a blanket of wool and smother the life out of your cat? Nope.This is my third Safavieh rug in 20 years (I have them in other rooms, didn\u2019t get rid of them), and this one is my favorite, hands down. The pattern is subtle and the colors are exactly as my screen read them in the ad\u2014modern muted tones of grey. No smells, as mentioned in other reviews. It\u2019s thick and soft underfoot, and, I\u2019m being serious, the very best bang for your buck out there. Buy this rug now.",
