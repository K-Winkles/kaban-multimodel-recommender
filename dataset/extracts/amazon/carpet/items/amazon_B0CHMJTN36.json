If you\u2019re looking for something for your kiddo\u2019s room, your pets, the garage, etc. then this will be a great fit. This is not luxury. It\u2019s faux luxury at a decent price! We got the black 8x10 for my daughter\u2019s room and she\u2019s in love. When putting in a kid\u2019s room you don\u2019t want expensive because \u201cthis is why we can\u2019t have nice things\u201d they ruin everything. The fibers are silky and soft and a bit slippery. I imagine that will fade with time and use. It\u2019s a thin rug that\u2019s very light. Easy to carry. Easy to move. Easy to adjust. Easy to shake out. There are nonslip things on the bottom but we have ours on a rug pad anyway. (If you want a cushier feel then get a deep rug pad and that way you can change out the rug anytime you want while keeping the rug pad the same.) The black is vibrant and a deep black. It came shrink wrapped and folded. We had to wait a few days to open ours so when we did, it did have fold creases and puffy spots. After letting it settle for a couple of hours and my daughter rolling around on it those disappeared. Ours didn\u2019t have a bad odor but I sprayed a light coat of fabric spray anyway. All in all, a good purchase for us and I would recommend for anyone that wants an inexpensive faux luxury item!",
