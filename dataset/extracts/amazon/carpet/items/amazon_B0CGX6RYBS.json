Then use a low-power vacuum cleaner. add some mild detergent and gently wash by hand, then put the rug in the ventilation to dry. REMIND: Not machine washable Is it the same thickness as the picture? No, it has creases and the rug fibers don't look fluffy. As these rugs are vacuum packed, they need to be put flat for a week to recover to their original thickness, we are very sorry to bring you some inconvenience. Is the bottom of the rug slippery? Depending on the material on which the carpet is placed, the bottom is recommended to use a non-slip pad or use carpet tape to fix it, can better play the role of anti-slip. Can I return it if I don't like it? Sure, we suggest you to contact before returning, you will receive satisfied reply within 24 hours.",

During the first wash on the gentle cycle the bottom of the rug tore. I was so disappointed. I decided to keep the rug though, because my son really loves it. I did purchase carpet stickers to keep the rug in place on the tile floors, because it slides all over otherwise. It's a very pretty rug, but it's obviously very cheaply manufactured.Side note: This is the second time I have purchased this rug. The first time I purchased it I put it in the dryer. Completely my mistake. The heat deformed the inner material and it was never the same. I didn't return the first rug, but I did end up just throwing it away.",

The difference with the two is that this one never fully inflated from the vacuum seal they sent it in. It has been a month and it is still crinkled and so badly warped that It won't even lay flat. The lines from the packaging won't come out and are so firm it feels like boning used in dresses. I would pass on this rug strictly because of how it is sent and how impossible it is to remove the crinkles. I am so disappointed. Of course by time I realized the wrinkles would not come out the return window had expired.",

The backing could be a little more stick to help it stick to the floor cause it's so flimsy it moves around a lot. It holds things in the long hairs of the fuzz. It vacuums but with it being flimsy you have to hold it down cause the vacuum tries to suck it up. I wouldn't buy again for those reasons.
