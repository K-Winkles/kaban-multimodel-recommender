                "reviewText": "This rug is great to make a smaller living/hangout room feel really cozy. It is extremely soft but not too slippery when you walk on it with socks. It is not very thick or sturdy but this is to be expected at this price point. This means that you really need to use rug tape to secure it to the floor so it does't bunch up or crease. The Khaki color is good at hiding dirt but still looks bright. It can be a bit tricky to clean but that has not been too much of a problem overall. All in all, love this rug and would highly recommend.",

Pictured is the 5 foot by 7 foot rug, which turned out to be a bit big for the space I had. Sorry about that!As you can see, our elderly terrier was VERY interested! The rug is quite colorful. They call it tie dyed, but I'm from the tie dye generation, and tie dye it ain't, but it is definitely pretty! The size is just right for a toddler's or young child's room. The built in padding will do a lot to cushion falls for sure. It is padded enough for children to nap on, which is really convenient! I will be putting this rug in our granddaughter's room, and I know she will just love it!Days later: I can verify that this rug is machine washable. I had to wash it twice because it so completely fills the washer that the first wash did not get all of the dirt. Second wash left it perfect. My washer is a large drum front loading washer.",

It's not what I think of when I hear the words tie-dye though. I do like the pattern and it would work well for a bedroom. If it wasn't too big for mine, I'd use it there.
