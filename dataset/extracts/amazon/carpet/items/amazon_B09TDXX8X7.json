                "reviewText": "I first purchased one of these for my daughter's dorm to go between the beds. 5 minutes later, I decided to purchase another one (because the price was so great!) to go between my other 2 daughter's twin beds- today we received the one for home and it fit perfectly between the 2 beds and my daughters are so happy with the sizing and the color. We purchased the gray color, but this rug comes in so many pretty colors!It does NOT shed at all-of course we just received it today, but we did walk on it quite a bit with our socks on.So, we received the package and it was vacuum packed and once the package was opened it poofed up. The directions said that the bottom underpad would puff up in 1-2 days so we are waiting on that. It is non slip underneath, but I may still buy something to give it a little more added lift to make the underpad seem thicker.All in all, this is so worth it for the money! WE bought the 4 x 5.3. I am so so happy with our purchase so far!Plus I ordered it with Prime on a Saturday and it arrived on a Sunday, the next day! AWESOME!The one I ordered for my daughter's dorm I had shipped directly to her dorm and will be super easy for her to carry back to her room from the mail room because the package is so compact and not real heavy at all. I also ordered that one on Saturday and that is scheduled to arrive 3 days later on Tuesday, which is not back considering her dorm/college is a bit remote. (Our home one probably arrived so quickly because Amazon has a facility like 7 minutes from my home!) :)",
