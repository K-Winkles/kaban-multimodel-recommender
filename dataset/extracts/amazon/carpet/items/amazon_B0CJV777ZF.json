Because our rugs are vacuum-packed and then shipped for a long time, it will cause the fiber hairs don't look fluffy enough when they are just unpacked. You can lay the carpet flat to rest 3-4 angels sponge recovery, the carpet will become fluffy. What if I just received a carpet that is not non-slip? Because the carpet is compressed, the sponge is not fluffy enough will lead to non-slip, please leave it to rest for 3-4 days will be restored.

                "reviewText": "I love this rug! It is not heavy, but has a nice thick pile. It is ridiculously soft. Seriously, I usually go barefoot at home, and occasionally I go out of my way just to walk across this rug. The color is listed as dark gray, but I have found it depends on your surroundings. In a room decorated in neutral colors, it looks gray. In a room with a lot of blues, it appears a beautiful slate color with a hint of blue. It has a non-skid backing, which is very important to me.But here\u2019s the best part: IT ARRIVED ROLLED, NOT FOLDED. Everything comes vacuum sealed now. I understand the concept, but some things don\u2019t fare well folded up and vacuum sealed into a tiny little package. A smaller rug I ordered previously came folded in a square and vacuum sealed. It\u2019s also a very nice rug, but it has obvious fold lines that are probably permanent. This beauty came vacuum sealed in a small package, but in a roll, not a square. When I cut the packaging away and opened it out, it was ready to go; no fold lines. Whoever packaged this rug is a genius.A beautiful rug that lays flat with no fold lines is an extra added benefit. But the number one selling point is the beauty and comfort of this rug. I highly recommend it.",

There are gripper dots that keep the rug in place. You can vacuum the rug easily. I got the light gray color so it will go with all of my comforter sets. It came vacuum sealed. Once I opened itand took it out of the plastic bag, it fluffed right up. I got the 5 ft by 7 ft and it fits next to my Queen bed very well. It dosen't shed and it's supper fluffy. This was a great pick!!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this rug for our master bedroom. It is so soft and fluffy. I should have read the included instructions that states to lay it flat for 2-3 days to fully decompress before I put it in position. It should still be able to decompress. It\u2019s 8x10\u2019 so I really didn\u2019t have an empty spot to lay for a few days anyway. I got the dark grey and love the color. It feels thin now but I\u2019m sure that it will get thicker as the days go by. It says in the description that it is machine washable but the instructions that come with it state to only hand wash. It\u2019s kind of big to put in a washer anyway. Our Labradors must love it because they laid on it instead of their thick pet beds. LOL",

                "reviewText": "As advertised, this area rug is soft and shaggy, but it is not at all \u201cfluffy.\u201d The main problem is that the deep pile is not thick or dense enough. The manufacturer photo that shows 1.7\u201d high pile is a fantasy. The pile is indeed over 1.5\u201d long, but it\u2019s not as dense as shown in the photos and so it all flops over and is flat. So yes, it\u2019s soft, but also very thin.Pros: * soft * inexpensive ($35 for 5x7) * spongy backing, like on a bathmatCons: * not fluffy * pile is not dense enough to stand up, as advertised * feels cheap, like a soft bathmat",

                "reviewText": "Waiting 5 days before reviewing this item allowing the carpet fibers time to relax as per its instructions,to provide an accurate description.Arriving vacuum sealed in a small light box my first impression was that I received the wrong item,fortualy that wasn't the case.After reading several positive reviews about this product I decided to order one for myself.Remaining unused and laid flat for almost a week,left me feeling a bit disappointed.Unfortunately this carpet still doesn't appear super plush as depicted.The texture of rug itself is soft enough to the touch and looks nice from afar,emitting no foul odor,as opposed to other carpets previously ordered.However I was expecting something a bit thicker.Noticing that the other reviewers ordered this item in gray,depicting much thicker carpets in their images puzzled me.Failing to see a correlation between color choice and fiber count,consigning myself to the fact that,the one I received wasn't constructed as well,which does happen occasionally.Acknowledging the roulette game we play when ordering online products,I will cut my losses.Esthetically the carpet appears acceptable in its location,concurrently fluffing up a bit after resting,however not to the degree as seen in the advertised images.Having a soft feel it is nice to walk on,and with proper care it should endure much use.Sadly in my opinion it's a bit overpriced.Hopefully others fare better than myself,if deciding to make this purchase.Overall this is a very basic carpet best suited for those with mid-century modern decor.Unfortunately due to its mediocre craftsmanship,and after affording it every possible advantage,Im only able to rate it with three stars.",
