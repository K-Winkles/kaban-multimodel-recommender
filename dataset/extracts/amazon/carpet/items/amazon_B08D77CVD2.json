The 3'x5' is a really good size for in my kitchen and the price is good considering a lot of kitchen mats are expensive for something smaller. The rug is not very dense meaning they could have got a lot more strands of fiber on the backing, a lot of the backing is not covered with fiber strands. I have yet to vacuum them (I have a 4'x6' in my bedroom as well) so I'm not sure how they're going to be whether it'll pull anything off. For the size of them and the prices I'd say they're really good in that respect. Also one of the pictures for this item it states 1.7\" for the height of the rug that is so inaccurate because that is stating the height when the fiber strands are extended when you pull it up but these fiber strands do not stay up they lay flat they're extremely thin.",
