                "reviewText": "I decided to add photos to my review, I've never taken the time to add pictures to an Amazon review before BUT I think this might help someone else. The print looks like it has ready made stains on it, the \"distressing/aged\" graphic designer went a little TOO DARK on the shading. The design really looks as though someone spilled Coke Cola on the rug and left sticky spots. There are some dark marks that stand out too much and it looks like I'm a slob and left stains on the rug. I know they are going for an antique look but my eye just goes to the dark marks immediately.So it's not great. It is on the thin side but I think it will be okay once it flattens out. It arrived clean and dry in great packaging. The print is slightly odd because the faux-worn look does make it look like it's already pre-stained in some areas.Since I got it on sale for temporary use I wasn't expecting a whole lot from it. I'm not unpleased. Now if I had paid more for it my expectations would be for more thickness and for the pattern to look just a little nicer.The gray is a silvery gray so it doesn't look very good against a lot of beige, tans and warm colors. In a room with blacks and very dark grays this rug might look good.The rug is also much lighter in person than on the promo photo, I looked up the comparable Benjamin Moore paint color numbers and noted them in an earlier review here but they didn't save it seems. It is not a dark gray or even a medium gray color. I have some medium gray in my floor tiles so I thought this rug would go with it and it does not. In fact the rug doesn't match anything in my room at all. It's a pretty gray BUT it's not a neutral gray if you know what I mean? Some items look good in a lot of settings and this rug doesn't look right here nor does it look right in my friend's color scheme... so I'm not sure why, it just stands out as a separate non blending in item.I thought the promo photo looked more like paint sample (Steel Wool 2121-20) in person it looks more like a lighter (Wish AF-680). I took a my pictures at night and not under great light conditions.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased rugs from NuLoom before and they are great. This rug is awful, the rug is falling apart after a few weeks and is not \"square\", meaning it's got a wrinkle in it that won't allow it to sit flatly on the floor. It's an awful rug. Which is really too bad because it's very pretty! Go find this pattern from a different brand, this one's a dud.",
