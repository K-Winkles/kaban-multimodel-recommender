I've had it for a few weeks now, and it's still holding up great.It's a beautiful rug that looks great in my living room. The pattern is really unique. It's really soft and comfortable to walk on.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish, comfortable, and easy-to-clean rug for their home.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The abstract pattern may be incorporated into a wide variety of design schemes without seeming out of place, making it a flexible choice for a variety of settings. In particular, the color black brings a sense of modernity and elegance to the space while also serving to seamlessly bring it all together. The fact that this rug prioritizes ease is perhaps what sets it apart from others on the market. The fact that it can be washed in a machine is a game-changer, particularly for places that get a lot of foot traffic, like the living room. It's inevitable that accidents will take place, but if you have this carpeting, cleaning them up will be a snap. I have already examined its capacity to withstand being washed, and the result was that it emerged from the cycle seeming just as colorful and velvety as it did on the very first day. It gives me a feeling of comfort to know that I've made an investment in a rug that not only matches my aesthetic but also holds up well to the scuffs and scratches that come with living a normal life. My floors will not get dirty or covered in unattractive threads thanks to the non-shedding characteristic of the rug, which is a problem that I have had in the past with previous rugs that I have had.",

                "reviewText": "The rug was delivered in a smaller box and my first thought was \"this rug is going to be a pain in the butt to get smoothed out.\" Luckily, I did not have that problem at all. The rug was folded, but when opening the packaging it smoothed out right away without any creases, lumps, or curled corners. The rug is soft and a great cover on non-carpeted floors. I was so pleased with the quality and price that I just ordered another one.",
