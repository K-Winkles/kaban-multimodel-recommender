            "Classical Style Design: Hutha large area rug combines elements of Moroccan motifs with minimalist color design and modern style to create a abundant colorful living space for your kids and pets. No one can ignore the beautiful appearance of this light grey rug, which makes this grey carpet ideal for home room decor.",
            "Extra Soft Rug: Through the combination of mechanical and manual weaving, the grey area rug is thick and soft enough. The microfibers on the top of the modern area rug enhance incredible softness. You can feel it with your feet, or lie down to enjoy the comfort and softness of the big rug.",
            "Upgraded Anti-slip Dots: The three-layer structure of the grey fluffy rug, combined with the anti-slip particles on the bottom, allows the area carpet to be fixed on wooden or other floor and prevents the thick area rug from sliding. Even if you use the gray area rug as a living room rug, bedroom rug, or other room rug, the fluffy carpet will be sturdy.",
            "Easy to Clean: Daily cleaning of the shag area rug only requires a vacuum cleaner to keep the plush area rug clean. If you need to wash the washable rug, we recommend hand washing in cold water to ensure that the plush rug will be used for a long time. If machine washing is required, please avoid bleaching and vigorously washing the area rug.",
            "Service Guarantee: The large area rug is vacuum-packed and needs to be placed in a ventilated place for 2-3 days before use, and the grey and white rug will be fluffy naturally. Please choose the correct size according to the actual need. If you have any questions, please contact us, we will provide you with satisfactory answers."

                "reviewText": "I hesitated to buy an area rug that I hadn't seen IRL, and at such a low price, I wasn't sure it would be a good quality. I ordered a 6\u00d79 size for my living room, and thought the package would be huge, so I was REALLY worried when it came in such a small box!The package came as a maybe 1' \u00d7 2' vacuum packed size, so I wasn't expecting a lot, and when I FIRST opened it, it seemed thin and not as wide as it should have been, but I laid it out and figured I'd give it a few days while I searched for a replacement. I have to admit it was IMMEDIATELY soft, fluffy, and really much prettier than the pictures depicted, so I was disappointed that it wasn't going to work.By the next day, after having lay open all night, the rug... body? backing? I'm not sure what you call it, but the part that the fluff is sewn into, that part had puffed up and thickened (like one of those mattress in a box that has to open up over night)... By the next day, the rug was MUCH softer to walk on and it had relaxed to its full size. I'm in LOVE with my rug!!! It's so soft, the top that you walk on is so fluffy - I love waking up, drinking my cuppa coffee and just rubbing my bare feet across it, lol, it's better than burying your feet in the sand at the beach!This rug is WELL worth the price, I've saved the seller in my \"favorites\" because I plan to buy another rug in a different color for my bedroom and a third for the spare room. I recommend this rug to anyone!",

I placed it on front of my bed and the spot where I get in and out of bed is matting after only a month. Also, by nature of the design, small particles are hard to vacuum.",

The size is weird and does not seem to be symmetrical but again maybe that has to do with the not flattening. The quality of the material does feel cheap.",
