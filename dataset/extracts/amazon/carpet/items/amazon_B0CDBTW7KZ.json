                "reviewText": "This rug feels very much like a blanket, and came folded like one. The softness is nice, but my only issue with this is that three days have passed and the folds still haven't completely come out. I'm hoping that it will flatten out soon.I love the fact that this rug doesn't slide around on my hardwood floors. The backing is clearly of superior quality, and does not require any type of padding or mounting.I purchased a color that should do a good job of concealing dirt. I placed the rug in a high-traffic area just in front of the sliding glass door that leads to my patio. There's an indoor/outdoor rug right on the other side, so between the two of them my floors should stay clean the way I like them.",

                "reviewText": "I received the orange ombre and I couldn't be more in love! I have this in my entryway, a high-traffic area, as a segue from my tonal beige decor into my main living area which is beige, burnt orange, black, and ivory. I have always struggled to find just the right rug and this one is perfect in every way.The fabric feels luxurious, almost like terrycloth and velvet, creating a cozy atmosphere that my dog is obsessed with. He is a non-shedding dog, but the quality material doesn't feel like something hair would cling to. I can confidently place it on my tiled floors without worrying about dangerous slips. The safety aspect coupled with its softness makes it an ideal choice for hallways and high-traffic areas.Maintenance is a breeze with this machine-washable rug. It retains its shape even after washing, and daily care is as simple as using a small handheld vacuum cleaner to remove dust. The ease of cleaning adds to its practicality.This runner rug combines luxurious comfort, safety, and eco-friendliness. It not only enhances the aesthetics of my space but also provides a practical solution for high-traffic areas. I highly recommend this runner for anyone seeking a soft, non-slip, and easy-to-maintain addition to their home. Love, love, love!",

It is soft, does not slid around, and is thin enough that you do it trip on it.i also love the price! I hope I can find a larger version of this one. I need a 5x7 or 8x10. I see pictures of larger rugs but I can\u2019t find them. Help!",
