            "Impeccably Constructed: The sandwich structure formed by the plush on the surface, the sponge in the middle, and the anti-skid layer at the bottom makes the fluffy area rug softer and help with noise reduction. Your kids and cats will laze on the carpet around the clock.",
            "Supremely Practical Bottom: Our shaggy runner rug uses a non-woven bottom this time, which is nicely covered in grippy particle and increases the friction between the rug runner and floor, so it doesn't move on your hardwood or tile floors.",
            "Ultra Versatile Decoration: This fuzzy throw rug is designed in tie-dyed, can be a fun and coloful way to spruce up the room and add warmth and elegance, perfect as your bedroom rug, living room rug, dorm rug, kids rug, play room rug, nursery rug, and Christmas holiday gifts.",
            "Warm Tips: The furry hallway runner rug is vacuum-packed, which may has a little smell or creases. Shaking it outdoors to remove dust and laying the shag fur rug flat on the floor for 3-5 days will reduce wrinkles."

It won't show additional spills or soil provided by a young fellow. On the negative side, I wonder if it will withstand the robot vacuum or the upright. I expect it will mat if I throw it into the washing machine. The fibers are long and soft and make the floor soft to walk on and will be warm in the cold months, but how long the runner will last under normal cleaning conditions is in question at this time. It's too new to comment in that regard.",
