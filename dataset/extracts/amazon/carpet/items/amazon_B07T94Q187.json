For hard to remove stains we recommend that the rug be professionally cleaned. USE A RUG PAD A non-slip rug pad\u2019s primary benefits are safety and cushioning. However, it also prolongs the life of your rug and makes it easier to vacuum. TAME THE SHAG A great tip for cleaning a shag rug is to turn it upside down and vacuum the back with the beater bar setting. This will shake loose all the dirt and dust. Once done, move the rug and vacuum up all the dirt that came loose onto the floor.",

                "reviewText": "\u2014Update 12/19/21:I\u2019ve read through some of the new reviews and noticed people talking about \u201cwaves\u201d and that the carpet won\u2019t lay flat. If you have furniture sitting on this carpet than shuffle your feet across the carpet and lift the furniture to help it stretch. I have furniture on two sides and a heavy coffee table so I shuffled around in each direction and we have no waves at all. If you don\u2019t have furniture on this than I might say this isn\u2019t for you. Stains have continued to be easily removed and the corners and sides have relaxed to flat with time. I continue to recommend this carpet!\u2014This carpet comes just as described! It\u2019s exactly what I was looking for, inexpensive but modern and stylish. I previously had a short shag rug that just wasn\u2019t cutting it with a baby (so. much. spit-up) and a shedding dog, and it had also become very very difficult to vacuum. I debated buying a ruggable OR a more expensive vacuum that could handle the shag rug but it just felt so disgusting that I wanted to replace it. Ruggables are $$$ and so are nice vacuums so I came here looking for something that wouldn\u2019t break the bank and I wouldn\u2019t feel bad about chucking later on. This fits the bill. It IS thin, so if you\u2019re looking for plush this isn\u2019t for you. But you could buy a pad for underneath to help. I\u2019ve had this rug for about a week now and the edges have relaxed, but aren\u2019t laying completely flat (pictures are from right after I laid it down). I only have one corner exposed and it also sticks up a little, but some double sided tape would take care of that. There was some bubbling for the first couple days, so I just shuffled my feet across the carpet and picked up the furniture as I went to help it stretch and relax (it works!). The best part of this rug for me is that I can use my eureka stick vacuum or my really cheap bissell and both do an incredible job of getting the dog hair up. Both vacuums have rotating heads and using them hasn\u2019t caused any damage. My dog also chewed a carrot on the rug and got orange stains on it so I used some dog carpet stain remover and it came right up. Our family doesn\u2019t wear shoes in the house so I can\u2019t speak on how it will hold up to shoe traffic, but barefoot traffic hasn\u2019t caused any changes in the pattern or material yet. I have absolutely no complaints about this carpet! Just remember, this is Amazon and you\u2019re buying a cheap product so don\u2019t expect the world!I live by reviews on products since descriptions and sellers can be deceiving, so hopefully this review helps someone!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my living room. It actually arrived a few days early which I\u2019m not mad about but I had to open and unravel the 8x10 rug as soon as I could, since it\u2019s probably been sitting in a warehouse somewhere. I really appreciated how the rug was packed before being shipped, lots of plastic wrap, roll bar, and even had cloth covers on each end for extra protection.After I opened it up and rolled it out, I noticed how nearly all four corners would not lie flat. So I had to consult YouTube for advice on that\u2026 a free ice cubes and heavy enough object did the trick.Overall, I\u2019m very happy with how this rug looks and feels. It\u2019s not super thick, which I personally don\u2019t mind, but it still feels great underneath and the patterns are printed nicely. Very happy with this product.",

The size I got is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be, but that was my mistake. I ended up just pushing it back further underneath the couch and now it's perfect. There is a pesky corner that will not lay flat no matter what I do which causes a major trip hazard for us, but we already lifted the couch once to lay it down and don't want to do it again. Did not notice a smell like some have mentioned. Great rug, great quality, worth the price!",
