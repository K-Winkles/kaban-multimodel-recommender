The tie-dyed design adds a trendy and unique touch to my space, instantly enhancing the overall aesthetics.The plush and fuzzy texture of the rug is a game-changer. It's incredibly soft and feels luxurious underfoot, making my living room not only stylish but also inviting and comfortable. The 5 x 8 size fits my space perfectly, adding warmth and coziness to the room.One of the standout features is the ultra-soft fluffy feel of the rug. It's a joy to walk on, and my family and guests have all commented on how comfortable it is. The quality of the material is impressive, and I can tell that it's built to last.Cleaning and maintaining the rug have been surprisingly easy. Despite its fluffy appearance, it doesn't trap dirt easily, and any spills or stains have been simple to spot. This is a big plus for me as I wanted a rug that's both stylish and practical.Overall, the Deerhoo Large Shag Area Rug has exceeded my expectations. It's a fantastic addition to my living room, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, stylish, and ultra-soft shag rug for their home.",

I decided to wait it out and see if it would disappear. I was wrong. my two cats wouldn\u2019t go on the rug because they were so confused and disgusted about the smell. the walked around the perimeter and jumped the corners just so they wouldn\u2019t have to touch it. about 2 hours later i go to look into the mirror\u2026. my face was beet red along with my neck and chest. my first thought was not the rug but after my boyfriend thought it was the rug immediately it all made sense. not only was the smell so bad, when in a different room the smell was stuck in my nose for hours. i put the rug outside and clicked return immediately.",
