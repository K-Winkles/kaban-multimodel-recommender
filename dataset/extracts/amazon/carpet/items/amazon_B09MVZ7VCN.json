I can roll this up and air it outside, or take it out and shake to flick off chip crumbs. My visitors literally take their socks off to feel this on their feet. One rubbed her cheek up and down on, said she never felt anything that soft except a baby rabbit. No alcohol was involved. You may think, its just a rug. It is a nice rug to look at, until you touch it and then you will say \"I have got to get me one of these rugs\".",

The cons are that it has a very strong chemical smell that smells like an old basement. My entire house stinks of this odor. I'm hoping it will fade soon. Literally smells like it sat in a wet old basement. It's slippery both by sliding fairly easy and by wearing socks and kids running too fast on this can possibly slip and fall. My daughters love to make snow angels on this rug and it leaves a pattern for a little bit. Overall, I am happy with this purchase and will be happier when the smell is gone.",
