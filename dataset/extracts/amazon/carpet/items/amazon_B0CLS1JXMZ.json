                "reviewText": "I have a floor area in my bedroom that, to me, pretty much seemed to be begging for something like this item to adorn it.BIG picture: this item showed up quickly. I love that this item has whatever it has that keeps it from slipping around the floor. I love that it is thinner, I think they refer to that as a short nap or is it knap? I AM not up on floor coverings lingo.So, technically, what you see is what you get and that's a good thing.My only two other things I would like to share and I do so at the end, because in a way I don't feel like they technically take away from this item being worthwhile, since they are my subjective points of view.1. This came in a variety of colors and I choose the black as I thought it would go best with my room's decor. In the image, it seemed to me it was mostly variations of white and black, kind of expected maybe some grey. And so when I opened the package and saw the pops of blue in the pattern. I was not the happiest of campers. For had I been aware, I would not have ordered this. Regardless, in all fairness, I installed it on said floor just to see. And in doing so, it does seem like the blue is ever so slight enough that now that I have this item on my floor it is not a deal breaker.2. I recently was the delighted recipient of another floor covering for my home. And I don't know what it is that is different about that floor covering compared to this one that is the reason why. Yet by comparison, this item with the subtle pops of blue is not as soft when you walk around on it bare-footed. It's not horrible. And had I not recently received the other floor covering, I probably wouldn't have actually noticed it too much. It's just that since where I chose to place this particular floor covering is what I step on bare-footed as I get out of bed, a bit more softness for me would be more luxurious feeling. Again, though, that is my point of view and depending on where you are thinking of putting this item, if you were to order it...you may not care enough about that enough for it to be a deal breaker.Again, overall, BIG PICTURE, I AM pleased and will keep this on my floor at least for the time being.",
