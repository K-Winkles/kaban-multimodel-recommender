The other rug went in my daughter\u2019s room and I am going to buy another one for my room!!! So soft too!! Kids love them!!! Only downfall is I wish there were more colors/patterns to choose from.",

I can't even put it in the nursery because of the scent. Total waste of money.The quality of the rug is what you expect for the price, definitely feels a little cheap. However, it is SUPER soft and my 1 year old son loves running around barefoot on it! The color is nice and exactly as pictured. The biggest negative is the SMELL. Absolutely disgusting and gave me a headache immediately, and it stunk up half our house. We've let it sit out with the windows open for almost 24 hours now and it's still stinky, but I sprinkled it with baking soda so I'm hoping that'll work.",
