It sheds more than 10 cats, so much so that it clogged the washing machine filter!Exaggerating of course, but it does shed fibers. Thickness - good, size - good, price a little on the high side. Overall good buy!",

It is very soft on the knees and looks exactly like the pictures.A great prayer rug. It is also big enough for two people to pray on it at the same time (while it is vertical) and up to 3-4 people when it is horizontal.Definitely recommend",
