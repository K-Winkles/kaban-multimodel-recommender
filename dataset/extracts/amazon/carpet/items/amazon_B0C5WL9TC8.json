I tried to contact the company to see if there was something I could do to keep the new ones I ordered (yes, I loved them so much I bought more, even after I knew they would separate), from separating. Much to my disappointment, the company never got back to me.Even though I love how they look and feel, I won't be purchasing any more and their customer service is nonexistent.",

We have small children and intended to use the rug as an additional safety measure as the floor at the bottom of the stairs is hard and not carpet. It also stays put when we step down, sometimes while holding a baby.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These look and feel great. They are very soft. Easy to use. I suggest subbing your hand under the peel to remove backing slowly. It tears easily when trying to go too quickly. My only complaint is that a third or more have very bent edges. The metal is uncomfortable to step on. I was able to flatten them a little but not as much as I\u2019d like. It\u2019s definitely not a deal breaker and they are much more comfortable than other stair treads I\u2019ve purchased. Overall, they are great for this price.",
