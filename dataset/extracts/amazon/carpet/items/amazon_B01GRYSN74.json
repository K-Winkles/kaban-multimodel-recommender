Designer Tip: Place your sofa or club chairs at the very edge of the rug with legs off to maintain stabilization and avoid a cluttered look and feel. To accommodate a mid- to large-size living room, an 8\u2019 x 10\u2019 rug is the most popular room layout with maximum comfort underfoot to add proportion and balance. Designer Tip: Place the front legs of your sofa or club chair on the outer edges of the rug to maintain stabilization and avoid a cluttered look and feel. For a large room, showcase a stunning 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 or 10\u2019 x 14\u2019 area rug to make a grand statement in a living space designed for luxurious entertainment gatherings. Designer Tip: Place your sofa, sectional, or club chairs with all legs on top of the rug for a much more \u201cpulled-together\u201d look and feel in large spaces.",

For a bedroom, a 5\u2019 x 8\u2019 rug is ideal for a full or twin size bed, and an 8\u2019 x 10\u2019 or 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 rug works well with a king or queen size bed.

It's actually a faded gray lavender blue. The greens are all in the olive family. The cream is more vanilla (yellow undertone) than ivory. While the colors weren't the exact shades I expected, the rug ended up working in my space, and I really enjoy it. It does shed a lot at first, but I've never had a new wool rug that didn't shed for a few months, at least. It depends on how often you vacuum it. The more often you vacuum, the faster it'll finish shedding.",
