Our boho rugs are packaged in a folded format, which is due to current crating restrictions and also to save on high shipping costs due to oversizing so that customers can get our rugs at the best charge. How to make creases disappear? Maybe you can try these way: 1. Reverse roll the rug, let it sit for a day or two; 2. Flatten the rug by applying weight; 3. Apply carpet tape; 4. Place the rug outside in the sunlight for a few hours; 5. Use a clothing steamer. How to clean the rug? The area rugs are safe in the washing machine. Also for daily cleaning with vacuum cleaner, broom. Tips: Wash in cold water with mild detergent; Do not use chlorine or bleach; Tumble dry on low heat or lay to air dry. Why is there a color difference? 1. Different batches may have different colors, which is normal; 2. Due to the light and screen display, the color of the floor mat may have some chromatic aberration in different environments.",

It washes beautifully, stain came out and dried quickly on extra low in the dryer! The colors are even better than the picture and the rug is not heavy. I washed it in my front load washer. This rug is also so soft! I bought a 2x6 also! It was a great value and even better price! I bought a back up rug too since I love it so much!Lastly, it vacuums well but maybe just don't try to go back and forth on rug. I have a shark vacuum.",

It came vacuum sealed, so there were many creases that didn't come out after laying on floor for 2 weeks. So I washed/dried it. Creases are better, might be better to wash than lay flat to dry. Picture shows immediately after washing/drying.",

                "reviewText": "Ok it was cheap. And I wasn't expecting too much. But this is barely a rug. I think calling it a mat would be more accurate. It is very thin, and the backing is fabric with little grippy dots that don't do much to stop it sliding around on a bare floor. It looks nice from a distance, but it is maybe a quarter inch thick. And it comes folded up and there are a lot of creases. I thew it in the washing machine on a delicate cycle and in the dryer and it did relax some of the creases. I'm keeping it because my old dog needs a path on the tile floor where he doesn't slip. But it would be a little embarrassing if I were to put this as a decorative rug for humans. If you need something colorful to cover under your desk where it won't get much traffic its probably ok, but I'm not expecting it to last very long. That being said, I might buy more so the dog will be comfortable.",

Point one-the pattern on this rug is a printed image, while the fibers on the rug are almost flat\u2026think printed picture on a sheet of paper. Point two-I ordered the red/blue. The color red is more orange than red. Point three-this rug is very cheaply made. I believe if I had felt the material before buying I would have realized that $50.00 was way too much to spend. It looks cheap and it feels cheaper. I know that I wasted my good money on this rug.The reason I gave it one star was that it was the length and width I needed.I do not know how long I will keep this in my sunroom before I donate this and just buy an area rug at Lowe\u2019s or Walmart.",
