This is a lightweight rug that will be easy to trip on, and easy to get sucked up into the vacuum, so be careful with it. But it has a great vibe and is muted and vintage/boho at the same time. And is a great price. So it's a keeper for me!",

The weave is pretty tight at the edges with the fringe which slightly distorts the shape but that is the only issue I could mention",

I have a dog + two kids + hubby's work boots to contend with, so I vacuum at least daily. This rug does GREAT handling the vacuuming. I use a Dyson on the low setting. No issues.Third, the quality is SO fantastic. Not to mention the value for the money. It also came packaged very nicely and when I unrolled it, the rug laid nice and flat - no awkward rolling or weird bumps.",

I bought it for my breakfast nook and it is PERFECT.I will say, the colors are much more muted in person than what is shown, however, I had read the reviews prior to purchasing it and it was the fact that the colors were more muted in person that made me want to buy it. If you\u2019re looking for a rug with cottage charm, that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Hobbit\u2019s home, this is the rug for you. It is also incredibly soft, which was a surprise to me because it looks like it would have the texture of jute, but it\u2019s more like a worn in cotton feel which is lovely. I haven\u2019t attempted to clean it yet (other than a cursory sweep) so I\u2019m interested to see how it does with a vacuum or my rug shampooer\u2026I\u2019m going to guess, not well since it\u2019s so soft. I think this is a rug that might warrant the purchase of a rug beater and hope that does the trick.",

The patterned part of the weave is basically just dye on what appears to be loose cotten-like fluff, so it 'flakes' off extremely easily, leaving lint-like little balls everywhere. The jute braiding has come undone in a bunch of places in the interior of the rug. There are threads coming loose everywhere. 3 weeks of barely walking on it and it looks terrible. I like the rustic aesthetic but this is just poor craftsmanship.I really wanted to like this rug; I love the rustic look, I love the pattern, I love the colors but there is no way this would last a fraction of what I'd expect for the price.
