Luckily, it did not catch fire and it did not burn down to the flooring. Great size as well. Perfect to make my living space a little more livable. Feels amazing under your feet.",

It\u2019s nearly bright white and after it is lying out for about 24 hours, it\u2019s as fluffy as it\u2019s going to get. It comes in a tiny package and is vacuum sealed (see photos). I was very surprised when it ended up being just right for our small, London flat. It\u2019s cozy and bright for these dark, winter days. It has a backing so it won\u2019t slip all over the hardwood floors. Fab! Do I think this will last for years to come? No. That\u2019s not why we purchased it. We have a new kitten and wanted something soft and inexpensive. We love this - and so does wee Esme.",
