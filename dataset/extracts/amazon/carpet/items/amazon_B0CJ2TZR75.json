            "Machine Wash: It is recommended to wash the rug in the washing machine before use. Our rugs are sent with vacuum compression. So don't be scared by the creases on your rug after you just opened the package. Washing the rug in the washing machine will quickly restore the fluffiness of the sponge and pile of the rug.",
            "Top Notch Quality: Our carpets are woven with faux wool on the surface. Imagine treating your feet to a plushy faux fur rug that gently caresses them instead of a cold, uninviting floor. We use high quality materials and high quality sewing techniques, so there will not be any shedding of wool in our carpets.",
            "Cushion and Warmth: The area rug has a sponge interlayer in the center. It provides cushioning and warmth, muffles sounds, and adds a decorative layer to a room. The long pile with a thick sponge interlayer makes for a thick rug. It\u2019s pretty soft makes it a dream to walk in barefoot.",
            "Non-slip: The bottom of the area rug has dense rubberized dots attached to it. These rubber dots increase the friction between the area rug and the floor, allowing the area rug to stay in place on the floor. The non-slip and low pile design allows the carpet to be used in high-traffic areas.",
            "Geometric Designs: Refreshing your Christmas home decor doesn't have to cost a fortune. These beautiful and incredibly soft area rugs will do just the trick. Our rugs have geometric designs which add a decorative touch to the rug. And we have a wide range of colors to choose from, so you can pick a matching rug based on your furniture color."

The smell lingers, I can\u2019t have that indoors. Complete waste of money.",

                "reviewText": "For the size and cost, you can\u2019t beat this Fosirug geometric area rug. I selected it in the gray color, and it is perfect as a compliment to my gray fabric bed frame. The geometric pattern gives it a little visual interest, but it\u2019s not over the top or too busy a print. I set this out straight out of the vacuum pack, and had no issues with creasing. But in all fairness, I also have 4 busybody dogs that spend way too much time investigating, and stomping on, any new rug I put out.This does not have super thick pile, which is what I was looking for as I\u2019d prefer having the rug be machine washable. I\u2019d describe this rug as having a feel similar to a high quality memory foam bath rug. I love that because it means it won\u2019t get imbedded with dirt in a way that makes it unsanitary and impossible to clean. I am very glad I ordered this product as it suits my needs well.",
