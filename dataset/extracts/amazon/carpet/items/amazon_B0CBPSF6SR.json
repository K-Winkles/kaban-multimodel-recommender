                "reviewText": "As a pet owner with two messy labradoodles, my yard has been utterly destroyed from years of digging, bathroom breaks, and zoomies. While I love letting them roam free outdoors, the muddy slosh and huge dead grass patches were an eyesore. Instead of constantly reseeding, I decided to install this handy artificial turf grass rug - and my pups now have their own posh potty patio!I absolutely love how real this synthetic grass looks with its springy blade texture and rich emerald hue. The 0.8 inch blade height perfectly mimics a lush lawn, inviting paws for a rollick. Being UV-resistant and weatherproof, it maintains its vibrant color despite heavy use.Another bonus is the woven drainage holes which prevent urine puddles from pooling or stenches lingering. I just occasionally rinse it with the garden hose to keep the potty patch refreshed. So much easier than dealing with fertilizer and mud!Whether they're sunbathing, chasing squirrels, or doing their business, my dogs are obsessed with their new grass rug hangout. And I no longer cringe seeing brown patches ruining my lawn! For hassle-free, realistic turf that your pets will love, this is a phenomenal solution. It's the ultimate pet-friendly lawn substitute!",

                "reviewText": "Great size artificial turf mat! Perfect for outdoors, nice grass like resemblance, UV resistant and come with drainage holes. When receiving, it will need a bit fluffed up as the the grass strands are a bit matted from shipping. I placed mine out in an area of my yard that leads into a rock walkway, but always tends to get muddy. Drives me nuts. I have other areas of the yard that we have pieces of artificial turf left over from when we got the front yard covered and found that they do a nice job in helping over areas that can get muddy sometimes. Less messy, slippery and helps prevent mud coming into the house from the dogs tracking in. So definitely handy on rainy days. Like that it is cut-able, to fit your area perfectly. Backing seems pretty durable and has drainage holes so water or urine doesn't pool up. Not as thick as professional turf, but a great alternative for the cost. Easy to spray down and keep fresh smelling. Overall, I'm happy with the quality of this artificial turf mat.",

We have a large patio that Izzy loves to spend time on when we are enjoying it, especially in the evening. She comes out with us and will sit, but not lay down on the hard cement. This grassy rug was the perfect solution. She not only will sit on it, but is comfortable stretching out on it as well. It came in a tight roll, but easily flattened out in a couple of days outside. It also has drainage holes in the anti-slip backing to allow it to dry after a rain or cleaning. Izzy recommends giving it five stars!",
