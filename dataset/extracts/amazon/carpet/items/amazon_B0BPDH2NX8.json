                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. i got the black 5x8 rug and for the price i paid it\u2019s honestly great! i read other reviews about it having a terrible smell but mine doesn\u2019t smell at all unless i literally put my nose into it, but it\u2019s not that bad and doesn\u2019t make my room smell. it\u2019s definitely thin and doesn\u2019t offer any cushion, but it\u2019s SUPER soft!! the color is true black but depending on which way the fur is facing it can look a bit shiny, but not in a bad way. there\u2019s a few lumps in the middle and fold lines from it being in the bag but i just took it out so i\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll flatten out over time. you can see the edges of the rug but that doesn\u2019t bother me since it\u2019s black, but it might be more noticeable if you get a brighter color. i have mine on a wooden floor and it doesn\u2019t slide around at all!it\u2019s a \u201cbudget rug\u201d for sure lol but i\u2019m really happy with it for the price i paid! however if you\u2019re looking for something more high quality i\u2019d recommend finding something a bit more expensive.PROS: super soft, true to size, true to color, doesn\u2019t slide around on hard flooring, really cuteCONS: very thin, no cushion, edges are visible, has some lumps in the middle that may or may not flatten out (not the fold lines from being in the bag, actual lumps)",
