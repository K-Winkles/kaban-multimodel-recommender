After washing, lay the grey carpets flat to dry to fluff it.",
            "Service Assurance: To ensure convenient transportation, we use vacuum packaging for grey bedroom rugs. Therefore when you open the package, the light grey rug may be thin.

My vacuum kept turning off and stopped working. It thought it was supposed to suck up the rug. I got a hang of it and was finally able to use the vacuum without it turning off. But even then I found it difficult to suck up the filth. You would have to get down on your hands and knees and pick up each piece of garbage out of the rug. Then my dog barfed on it and I almost about through it out. But for now its holding up and is an okay rug. So if you are going to buy this be careful of dropping garbage on it.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised at how nice the rug was compared to the price. It is very soft and fuzzy. It comes shrink wrapped which makes it a very small package and when you cut it out of the shrink wrap it expands. I got a 6 by 9 and it is a lot of rug for not a lot of coin. Good value.",
