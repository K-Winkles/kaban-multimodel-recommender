Yes it came folded but there are no fold marks. The backing is a quality suede. It doesn't slip. It's so soft and fluffy. It's not tacky or cheap looking. It feels plush under my bare feet. My dogs LOVE it so much I'll never buy another dog bed... just fold rug to desired size. I was so afraid of what the product may really look like that I almost canceled it. Wasted time because now I've ordered another for my husband's office. The dogs spend a lot of time there and now they can be super comfortable! The rug doesn't shed and it's easy to vacuum or just shake it outside. I wasn't expecting to be happy with my new bedroom rug but what a wonderful surprise! The bedroom door has to go over it to close and no problem. Get this rug!!",

                "reviewText": "I never write reviews, but I decided to in this case. I have three dogs who are all potty trained, however, they are temperamental and spiteful at times, so carpets can be difficult to keep nice and clean at times . In the past, I would typically drop off a carpet at Stanley Steemer every two months. I tried Ruggables and did not like how the corners turned up after washing. I was also looking for a \u201csofter look.\u201d I opened this rug and laid it down. I did not care for it too much originally, as it was very bright white. I had every intention of returning it the next day; however, one of my dogs had other plans, so I could not. \ud83e\udee4. I soaked the rug for an entire day with teabags, to try to make it more of a cream color, and then laid it back down. It is a thin rug; however, I have probably washed it about 10 times, and I think it still looks great!! I wash it on our delicate cycle, and air dry it in the dryer for two hours, and it\u2019s perfect. I laugh about how close I came to returning it. If you\u2019re looking for plush, this is not the right carpet, but if you\u2019re looking for general appearance, I think it does a great job!! The dogs like how soft it is, and I don\u2019t really care if they get it dirty, because I can just throw it in the washer! I highly recommend!!",
