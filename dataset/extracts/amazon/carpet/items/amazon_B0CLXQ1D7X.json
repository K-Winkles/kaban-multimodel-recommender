It's the SOFTEST rug with the most luxurious pad underneath. However... My toddler is a mess maker and enjoys pouring snacks and rinks on to the rug. His past times also include grinding already broken cookies and chips down into the fibers of the rug as well. Food pouches, gummy snacks, and crayons have also been dug, crushed, and otherwise discarded into and on to the rug as well. Once a week I pull up the rug, shake it out outside and stuff it into my top load 2015 model Roper washer. I even dry that sucker in my front load old as heck Maytag dryer. Fits easily, washes easily. and dries beautifully. Love this rug.I got a 5 x 7.",

                "reviewText": "As a big fan of rugs, especially with hardwood floors, I recently added this 5 x 7ft rug to my office space, and it has quickly become a game-changer. The size is perfect for placing under my desk, providing a cozy solution to prevent cold feet during long working hours.One of the standout features of this rug is its impeccable fit for my office setup. The 5 x 7ft dimensions are just right for the space, adding a layer of comfort without overwhelming the room. The rug's placement under the desk has made a significant difference, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere in my workspace.The softness of the rug is truly exceptional. Every step on its surface feels like a treat for the feet. The plush texture adds an extra layer of comfort, making my office space not only functional but also a delight to spend time in. It's evident that the rug has been crafted with quality in mind, enhancing the overall experience.While the 5 x 7ft size works perfectly for my office, I appreciate the reviewer's suggestion for larger rugs in living rooms and bedrooms. This versatile rug, with its soft and lightweight qualities, could indeed be a fantastic addition to various living spaces.In conclusion, if you're in search of a rug that fits seamlessly into your office space, provides comfort, and has a soft and lightweight feel, this 5 x 7ft rug is an excellent choice. It has certainly elevated my workspace, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to enhance the coziness and aesthetics of their office or any room with hardwood floors.",

It's nice and thick and well made. We had reservations about the lightness of the pattern and weather that will attract dirt, but it's still good looking after a month of heavy trampling and the fact that you can wash it is a real added bonus. A great rug.",

It almost feels like a cheap blanket sewn onto nonslip backing, and this causes it to lay awkwardly and show folds and impressions very easily. I haven't washed it yet, and I am honestly a little nervous about doing so as it's by no means high quality. For the price point, I expected a much better product.",

                "reviewText": "This rug was true to color and design as compared to the pictures. It feels very soft to walk on and makes a huge difference on the wood floor in the winter. I like that it\u2019s washable, although I have not tried that yet. I will probably bring it to a laundromat instead of using my washing machine at home. So far, I have really liked this rug, but if I had to point out an issue it would be with the weight. The rug is lightweight, which would seem to be an advantage, but makes it hard to vacuum. It\u2019s light enough that the vacuum can pull and bunch it up in areas if you\u2019re not careful. That\u2019s a small price to pay for a nice looking rug that feels this soft I think.",

                "reviewText": "I finally put this down in my home office and I love it! It IS super soft and velvety. It's not super thick but I was on the rug using some workout equipment and there was more than enough padding. I know it had been folded but I really don't see the fold marks and most washable type rugs come folded.I know using the vacuum can be a pain on smaller rugs but that is true even with super fancy smaller rugs. For this one, I've got a cat climber partially on it, a sewing machine table on one side, and a cat house on one side under my desk. As long as there is weight on it, it doesn't pull up.I've been using rugs lately, especially washable ones. We have cats (as noted by the cat stuff mentioned above) and they do track litter every so often. Our hardwood floors really need to be refinished also so the rugs help cover that. And by cat hair/litter/dust being held in the rug, the open hard wood places stay cleaner for longer!!I am very pleased.",

I was a bit worried at first because of the lighter colors and we do have pets. But so far, after a month of use there are no stains and it vacuums up well. It's large and made well but not extremely heavy so it's easy to move around and one person can do it!",
