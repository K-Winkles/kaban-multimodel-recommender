We have an 2 ft 8 inch by almost 8 feet and an 3 ft by 5 ft in our hallway that are beautiful. We also have the same one in the kitchen. The only negative is the one is the kitchen is actually lighter. Fortunately the 2 in the hallway are identical. Besides that, the quality is pretty much perfect, design is beautiful, and we wanted something that wouldn\u2019t move, lays flat and this does NOT move at all!! I will buy these for the rest of our house most definitely. PLUS they vacuum very, very well!! One of my 10 best finds on Amazon!! (I showed the larger & the smaller to show how these 2 are absolutely identical!). Just makes the hallway look fantastic!",

                "reviewText": "I bought one of these rugs as a test. They ARE thin. These are not plush type rugs. What I needed it for was to dress up our LVP floors, give a little visual interest to what would have been a sea of dark brown, AND give the dogs something to get a little traction on when running around the house. These work GREAT on ALL those fronts.Because they are thin, they ARE easy to clean. The unfold quickly - I actually ran the next ones I got through the dryer on low heat to get out the creases. Even without that they still flatten out in a few days. AFA stain resistance, haven't had any issues. ALSO with the multi-colored design, they hide almost ANYTHING spilled on them for me thus far.Softness - these are NOT plush. They're not concrete, but they are thin. Softer than my LVP, but if you're looking for something that feels good on your feet, these are NOT the ones. They WILL give you some traction though and the rubber type backing DOES hold them in place pretty well.",

                "reviewText": "If you understand what this rug is, and isn't, and it is what you are looking for, you will be satisfied. It is not a plush, thick carpet type rug. Calling it a rug is possibly even insulting to rugs. It is more like a blanket/mat with a nonskid backing.If you want something that is thick, soft, and plush, this will not satisfy. If you are looking for something that looks reasonably nice, is washable, and is easy to care for, this is a great option. I haven't washed it yet, but it is flexible and thin enough that I am confident it will fit in my machine. It does have nonskid backing, but since I am alternating this with another rug that does not have backing, it is sitting on top of another nonskid pad. It has a solid-ish surface and the decoration is likely painted/printed on. The surface reminds me of a flannel baby blanket - thin and soft to the touch, but not plush by any stretch of the imagination. What has sealed this for me as my favorite rug is how easy it is to clean. We have cats and kids. This means fur, hair, dirt, and puke. When I discovered the cat puke this morning it had likely been there a few hours. With any other carpet/rug, that would have meant fibers soaked with vomit that would likely need to be cleaned with chemicals and/or steam, and likely would have left a stain. With this rug, a wipe and quick scrub with a disinfecting wipe and it is completely clean! It also doesn't show cat fur and dirt. I'm always amazed when I vacuum or sweep, as fur and dirt are gathered off the rug that looked clean.If you are looking for a long term, NICE, \"real rug\", you will not be satisfied with this purchase. If you are looking for something that covers the floor, is easy to clean, and LOOKS nice, I highly recommend this. It would also be great for a baby play area. Bigger and more stable than a blanket, but if it catches spit up from tummy time, it is easily cleaned and can be thrown in the washer!",
