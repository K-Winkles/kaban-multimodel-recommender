The rug arrived in air tight packaging and once opened started to take it\u2019s natural shape and softness.Upon opening this rug did have that new chemical smell but letting it air out. Not sure how easy it will be to clean but for the price I wouldn\u2019t mind buying a new rug every so often.update: After 2 hours of letting it air out, I decided to wash the rug which was easy and helped SOOO much. I placed it in the dryer on low heat to dry. The color and softness remained great. Beautiful rug for the great price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the rainbow rug for my daughter's birthday to make her a little play area. It comes vacuum packed and when you first open it, it has a very strong smell so I recommend opening outside or washing it first since it takes a while to air out. Besides that it was the exact size it said and fit perfectly for where I needed it. The colors are very beautiful! It's easy to vacuum out any dirt or debris use a hose attachment since the long fibers will get stuck in the regular vacuum easily. I washed it once already and it held its shape and everything. I expected the fibers to get matted down easily but I've been super surprised by this rug they haven't got matted yet and it's used constantly. Very soft, comfy rug I would highly recommend this.",

The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is I feel it's not as wide but still works out great!",

                "reviewText": "My cat loves this rug, and I love that it is super easy to clean - my cat ate her wet food too fast and needed a soft, plush surface to regurgitate upon, and to my surprise I was able to get everything easily cleaned up with paper towels and an enzyme cleaner spray. I have blankets and pet beds with the same long pile texture that require machine washing to get out the same kind of messes so I'm very pleased with my purchase of this rug. It's super soft, has not had any shedding issues since I unpackaged it, and has a generously cushioned non slip backing that I've been able to sit on for an extended amount of time without having my sciatica act up. Seems like this rug is excellent value for the price I paid for it and I will definitely be ordering more when it comes time to replace my cat's and dog's pet blankets and bed mats!",
