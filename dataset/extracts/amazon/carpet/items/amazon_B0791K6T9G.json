                "reviewText": "**UPDATE**I purchased this rug almost a year ago and it has held up so well. Considering the price I am honestly impressed with how good it looks and how well it's held up over the past year. I have a 12 year old son, 3 cats and many foster puppies. It vacuums easy. Doesn't really stain but, admittedly, other than an occasional accident by a pup, we have really spilled anything on it. I did make the mistake of trying to shampoo this carpet. With hot water. I know I know. It ended up buckling a little. Thankfully I didn't do the whole rug and just the bottom portion. I moved the rug to my sons room. I purchased this exact rug in the 7 X 9 and I love it. I know it's silly to buy it again but I looked and looked and looked for another area rug that I would love and I just wasn't prepared to spend $200-$400 on a new rug. For $76 this rug is amazing.Follow the instructions provided to get the rug to lay flat. When I unroll the rug, I flip it upside down and let it sit for a day or so. This allows the rug to take shape. Then I flip it back over and set it how I want. You'll notice in the picture I have things sitting on the carpet and that's just to help it lay flat. Once I do that, it's fine and lays nicely. I love this rug.---------For the price, this is a great rug. I foster dogs so I wanted to purchase something that wasn\u2019t expensive and wouldn\u2019t be a terrible loss if ruined. This rug is gorgeous. I wasn\u2019t expecting the color to be so vibrant. Some have complained it\u2019s not \u201cplush\u201d but it\u2019s a $50 rug. Obviously it\u2019s not the same quality of a $200 rug. BUT, it\u2019s a great rug for the price. It\u2019s soft but it is thin. You will need something to help keep it in place. It slips around a bit. I purchased some rug corners and it sits in place just fine.This rug is also very easy to clean. Vacuum runs over it just fine. Dirt lifts easily. My cat had gotten sick on it - it was easy to clean. Didn\u2019t ruin the color or stain. I was nervous I\u2019d rub the blue and some of the color would come up. It didn\u2019t and still looks great, I\u2019ve had it for 3 months.",
