        "description": "There\u2019s no need to step lightly on your new carpet area rug from House, Home and More! Thanks to its non-slip rubber backing, this rug won\u2019t bunch up or shift under your feet. Your household will appreciate the added stability in your living spaces, especially older adults. Our carpet area rugs protect and add comfort to hard-surface floors and help to reduce noise throughout your home. HOW TO CHOOSE AREA RUGS: Area rugs are great for high-traffic areas, like living rooms and entryways, and add comfort to kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms. Rug size and color (or pattern) are relative to the size of the room and your personal design choices. In the living room, you generally want a rug size that extends immediately beyond the area of the furniture placed on top of it. When placing a rug (or rugs) in the kitchen or bathroom, you typically want to cover standing areas: in front of the sink or stove, just outside the shower or bathtub, etc. For a bedroom rug, strive for a size that extends beyond the sides and foot of the bed without going underneath nightstands. There are general design practices and recommendations, but in the end, these are personal style choices. ARE CARPET AREA RUGS PET FRIENDLY? Our area rugs provide stability and a cozy place for your pets to rest. The non-slip backing adds traction and creates a more secure setting for your household, including your dogs, cats and other pets. Walking on slippery hard-surface floors can be a difficult daily task for senior dogs and cats. The added comfort and grip of a rug will allow them to move with confidence. If you have pets, consider a color or design that won\u2019t showcase their shedding. HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR CARPET AREA RUG: Our carpet area rugs feature a non-slip rubber backing which helps to keep them in place while vacuuming, but can become damaged if put into a washing machine. When your rug needs cleaning, we recommend vacuuming to remove surface dirt and spot cleaning areas that need extra care.",

But we gave this one a try and have been very pleased. It laid completely flat from the moment we unrolled it, and they're not kidding when they say it won't bunch when vacuumed. The rubber backing keeps it firmly place and it has a dense tight weave that hasn't gotten snagged by our pets. The Praline Brown color is very attractive. We're glad we ordered a matching 2'\u00d73' one for inside the front door.",
