                "reviewText": "I purchased the cream white, size 5x8, and black, size 4x5.9 rugs. The colors of both rugs are as pictured and both are soft. However, the black rug is extremely soft and plush/thick, whereas the cream white rug is only soft, not plush at all, and it\u2019s very thin and slippery. I have hardwood floors and need area rugs for my senior pitbull who has stability issues. She needs runners and area rugs to keep her from falling and sliding all over the place. The plushy fabric is incredibly soft for her to have a solid grip and it doesn\u2019t slide around. I had to place the cream white rug on top of an existing area rug to prevent it from moving. Thumbs up for the black rug, \u201ceh\u201d on the 5x8 cream rug.",
