Super cozy resilient high-density sponge interlayer, which ensures the area rug is softer and more durable. Stepping on it will insulate you from the cold and hard floor.",
            "Non-slip Bottom: Thousands of non-slip dots at the bottom enhance the friction between the area rug and the floor, preventing it from sliding, and helping to prevent safety hazards such as trips and falls. Your kids or pets can play very happily and comfortably on the area rug. The non-slip rug will guard your every step.",
            "Perfect Family Decor: The comfy fuzzy plush rug combines a sense of cuteness and luxury with simple color, allows the rug to go perfectly with any room, such as bedroom, nursery, kid's playroom, living room, or home office. Enjoy a happy time chatting or playing with your family members on this ultra soft and skin-friendly carpet.",
            "Care Tips: Since the area rug comes with a vacuum-sealed bag, it may be slightly thinner than the picture. You had better take it out and place it flatly for several days to make the fur more supple and the interlayer re-fluff fully. The rug is also easy to clean: you can use a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer to remove dust efficiently. Additionally, it can be wiped with a damp cloth.",
            "Service Guarantee: There are multiple sizes and colors for your choice. We promise to return and replace the products due to quality problems within 30 days. If there are any questions or problems, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will try our best to solve the problem for you. We sincerely hope that every customer can have a satisfactory shopping experience."
