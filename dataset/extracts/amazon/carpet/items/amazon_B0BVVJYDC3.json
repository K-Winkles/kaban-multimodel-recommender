But it is so beautiful I decided to keep it anyway. Swapped it out for an old rug in one of the bathrooms and it is perfect for right in front of the sink and the softness under bare feet is actually a much better use for it. I realize now it would be a waste to use something so pretty and plush just to wipe our shoes on. This really is a lovely little rug.",

It doesn't hurt the material and easy to remove and reapply when they need washed.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two rugs. They look great. One is in the kitchen and one is in the entryway. Since I live in the midwest in winter, it didn\u2019t take long before the rug needed washed (1-2 weeks), so I threw it in the washing machine as I knew it was washable when I bought it, or I wouldn\u2019t have bought it. The stains came out well but the seams came apart in the washing machine. I went ahead and put it in the dryer. I read the description and it states to hang it dry so that\u2019s on me. I gave the lower review as it isn\u2019t as think as one I had from Kohl\u2019s for a similar price or as big and that it can\u2019t be dried. I can\u2019t imagine how long it would take to dry and be without a rug. I would have snow and salt grime all through my kitchen and dining room without a rug there. So it looks pretty, is soft, but is lacking in durability. I am going to attempt to hot glue the edges as I am not up for cost of replacing it at this time. I also got it on a limited deal and it is no longer that price.",
