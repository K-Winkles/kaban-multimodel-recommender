                "reviewText": "I have a dedicated music room in my home where all my instruments and equipment are set up. The color scheme in there is mostly monochrome. I bought a plain black rug to go under my drum set, but I got the measurements wrong and ended up with a rug that was far too big for the room. I finally got around to replacing it - and this smaller rug is just right for the job.It ships in a vacuum-sealed bag, which is handy for shipping purposes, but the rug had a slight chemical odor when I removed it from the bag. I aired it out for a couple of days, then washed it and air-dried it; that got rid of the smell and allowed the rug to fluff out properly. It is not a deep-pile rug, but it has a slight shag, which gives it a bit more interest than a regular flat rug. And having a rug under my kit doesn\u2019t improve my drumming, but it makes the room look more like a real band space and less like a library.I have the same rug in different colors in other parts of the house and I have no complaints about any of them. They are soft underfoot, add some nice color to the beige tiles, and help to define the different parts of the home. They are machine washable and don\u2019t take too long to air dry, so care and maintenance is easy to manage. All in all, this is a good value accessory for any home.",

                "reviewText": "I love this rug, it is like a giant blanket packaged into a floor rug. It feels like a cross between a fleece blanket and an incredibly soft and luxurious towel. It has a short fiber, as you can see in the photos but it is incredibly soft. While I was taking a few photos of this rug you can see one of my dogs came over and took up residence on it. It is light weight so is easy to move around the house, it has a rubber foam backing on it that helps it stay where you place it and not go for a walk across the wood floors.This rug is light weight, in fact my dog that you see in the photos, decided he wanted it and proceeded to pick it up and drag it to another room where it is now. I had planned to have this rug by my bed but my dog has decided that will not be the case. This rug is quick and easy to vacuum, and any strains on it come out easily with some dishwashing liquid on a damp paper towel. I would not risk washing this in the washing machine as it might come out a little bit matted, it is easy enough to clean by hand. I am loving this incredibly soft rug and my dog loves it too, I may have to order another one for me as originally planned.",

                "reviewText": "No doubt about it, this is a lightweight rug. It looks great and feels great to walk on. It is thin, kind of like a lightweight blanket, but with a textured bottom. My dog immediately claimed it as his new place to sleep, nap, or hang out. It attracted dog hair rather easily and needed to be cleaned the second day I had it. I was unable to vacuum it because my vacuum kept lifting it up. I opted to just throw it in the washing machine. It survived the cleaning and looks as good as new. This is a surprisingly rugged little rug. There is not a lot of padding, but it looks nice. All stitching seems to be quality and the color is pleasing.",

I washed it once so far, and it does wash well and comes out nicely. However, it will fill your washer (or at least it filled mine). I air dried it on the wash line. I don\u2019t think I would use it in a high traffic area, but I would recommend it. Five stars.",
