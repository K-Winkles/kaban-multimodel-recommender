                "reviewText": "So basically, this is one of my cats best friend, but more on that later.This rug is just so fantastic. I bought the white which I was worried I would regret having 3 cats, one dog, and living in the country so dirt roads and what not. But it hasn't been bad keeping it clean. Leaves are harder to get all the bits out of it when they have traveled inside on my dog. Its not hard to vacuum though I do have a cordless Dyson and the model I have is much less power than my corded shark vacuum. I do need to anchor down the side not under the couch so it doesn't get sucked up.There is a delightful amount of cushion to this rug. I can see how it would be perfect for a baby to play on.But here is where I am so extra impressed. So I know the seller said to not wash this rug. Well one of my cats had diarrhea on it. Yup diarrhea on a white rug the horror. Even worse we saw it just before going to work and we have been doing almost 60 hour work weeks during this holiday peak time. So we threw it downstairs in the laundry room and forgot about it. And not just for a day but like a week and a half..... so this diarrhea was fully crusted on. At this point a spot cleaning would not do. Also its winter and 20 degrees out so washing with a hose wasn't going to work either. I was worried the rug would be a goner. I decided to just go ahead and wash it. We ended up putting it in the dryer which perhaps we should have let it just air dry. We did put it on low heat.Well all of the diarrhea washed out and there is no sign or indication it was ever there. Now the downside is that now the top layer is loose from the cushion and from the bottom part so they don't necessarily move as one now. So when my cat plays on it and grips her nails into it the fluffy part comes up but the rest stays down so then I have to shake it a bit to get it to lay flat again. But I'm not taking any stars off because I washed the rug which we were told not to do. I do have a feeling it would have not done that had had we just let it air dry. But it just lays a bit off now. I'm just so thrilled I washed it and everything came off.Now, here is the best thing about the rug. Our one cat is OBSESSED WITH IT. I low key wonder if its like filled with catnip or something. I didnt realize how much until we had forgotten about it in the basement and finally got it washed and back upstairs. She will rug and tackle the rug, cuddle it, roll around like she is hopped up on something. We got her a super cool moving fish toy and she was like nah, but this rug is her favorite thing besides us and food.I am totally going to get a bigger one for our other family room. I wish there was a brown option.I am not recommending you wash this rug. But I am saying if you end up doing so, perhaps don't put it in the dryer. It definitely lays differently than it did before.",
