                "reviewText": "Was really just looking for a cheap and washable rug for puppy purposes. My ex's dog, who I lived with for most of her doggie life, has become best friends with my new dog and stays with us frequently. They love to play together for hours a day, and this is a great space for them to play comfortably on the floor (as opposed to just on the bed, and kind of on top of me lol).It's also great as a space for me to sit on the floor to play with and spend time with my pup. I haven't tried washing it yet, but the design and density of it make me think it should wash well and fit comfortably in my small washer (I got the 4' x 6'). It's not terribly cushy, but it does have a little bit of cushion and the fibers are soft - definitely much better of a play space for a person to sit on than a wood floor.Great, yet simple, rug for such a cheap price, and exactly what we needed for puppy purposes! (Not something I would recommend for elegance, but great for comfort and play!)",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this rug based on two main factors: machine washable and the plushness of it. Upon receiving it and setting it up, it wasn\u2019t quite as thick and plush as I imagined based off the posted photos. While it is soft, I also find it to be thinner with a cheaper material feel. I have three dogs and a high traffic living room. I wanted something that would be cost efficient, easily to be clean, and plusher for my son to sit on. It\u2019s not the best to vacuum, unfortunately. I did toss it in the washer just yesterday after a spill. The catch is they say not to dry it with the dryer and let it air dry, leaving your area without a rug for a longer period of time. Something I was not expecting. Taking it out of the washer, you can truly see how thin the product is and gaps where there\u2019s no fibers. This rug could potentially be nice for a less traffic area with no pet hair (holds onto it for dear life) and where it\u2019s less likely to obtain the need to be washed.",

I also love that you don't need an anti slip mat under it, it already has anti slip dots on the underside! It seems to be made well and I'm very happy with the quality for the price! I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a super soft, shaggier rug...you will not be disappointed!!",
