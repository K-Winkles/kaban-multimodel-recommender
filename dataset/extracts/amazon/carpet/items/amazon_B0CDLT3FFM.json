I thought it would be great to be able to sit on the floor to play with the kitties on the plush rug. I'm actually a little disappointed because it's really not that thick deep plush as it appears in the picture. It is decent enough though and it will do for the purpose I intended to use it for. It was inexpensive so I guess the value is fair enough for the price.",
