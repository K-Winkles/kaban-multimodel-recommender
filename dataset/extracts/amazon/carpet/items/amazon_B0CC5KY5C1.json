                "reviewText": "I wanted an area rug to go with my new comforter but I want sure what kind of color or pattern would go will with it. I decided on this one because it looked fairly subtle, and the price was good. When it came out was a tiny package, the rug was all folded up and vacuum sealed in a plastic bag. That worried me, I was afraid it was going to be so thin and rumpled. But when I opened it and laid it out I was pleasantly surprised. It laid out nice and flat, just some minor fold marks that aren't very noticeable. The rug is quite thin, but it's beautifully silky underfoot. I will probably put a pad underneath just to make it more cushy, but it's fine as is. And it doesn't slip around at all. The colors and design are lovely, soft and muted. I'm very happy with it overall.",

                "reviewText": "This rug has a very flexible backing that allows it to be washable and flatten out very well. The picture was taken about 24 hours after we laid out ours and there are barely any creases left. The pile is super soft to the touch, and the colors are really beautiful and true to the pictures. My one con so far is that the material feels pretty slippery underfoot when wearing socks, but because it's in a bedroom, not a high traffic area, I don't foresee it being a problem. Since we just got it, I can't speak to durability, but it doesn't feel horribly cheap. It's not a very thick rug, but that's preferable for the space ours is in, so I don't see it as a con, but if you're looking to add cushiness, you'll want a carpet pad.",

I also feel like it was much more pink in person. I tried to give it a go and after I put it out I tried to vacuum it and my vacuum wouldn\u2019t go over the rug (I have 5 rugs in my home and don\u2019t have this issue with any of them). I even turned off the roller but the rug is so thin my vacuum tried to eat it\u2026although maybe you could tape it down and have better luck. Another issue I had is by only walking across and sitting down on the rug it caused it to fold and crease and move out of place. (See second pic)That\u2019s when I decided this isn\u2019t the rug for me. I gave 3 stars because for the price I think you get a fair product. If it\u2019s all you have the budget for then you can make it work and it will look nice! But if you can afford to splurge to buy something of higher quality then I recommend doing that. I ended up returning this product :/",
