It came very well protected in heavy duty plastic and even had material covering each end of the rolled up rug. The edges do curl up which has been a tripping hazard, but I just need to get double sided tape and that will fix the problem which makes it not a problem at all. I have the rug on a wood floor and it is thick enough not to need any kind of padding underneath it. It is extremely soft and has an elegant look. I am more than happy that I purchased this rug and have no complaints. This rug is made well and very durable. I bought this in the 8x10 size which is exactly that. The price for this rug is great for how well it is made and how attractive it is. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "When we moved into our apartment, the beige carpet was not changed, and the room needed some color. We have put the Safavieh (8 by 10) rug over the existing carpet in the living room, and it looks wonderful. Also, if you are wondering if the colors shown in the pictures of the carpet are accurate, they are. We also bought the round 6' diameter version of the same pattern for our dining area to go under our small, round dining table and the 2'3\" by 7' runner for the short hallway into the kitchen. The set of three look great together. The only rug of the three that moves on the underlying carpet is the hallway runner. We live in central Florida and an added benefit to the thickness of the rug on top of carpet is that it seems to store coolness from the air conditioner, so it is actually cool to walk on. We go around barefoot in the apartment, and the rugs feel really thick and plush under our feet.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect area rug for an informal living area. Provides a pleasant pattern without being either too formal or kitschy. Could complement many different decors, including my \"mid-century lite\" decor. The blue multi-hued pattern helps bring together a variety of blue hues in the room, complements tan/cigar leather, and looks great on a medium dark oak floor. It's very soft and comfortable to walk on. Routine cleaning is easy (fortunately have not needed to assess cleaning of a spill disaster).",
