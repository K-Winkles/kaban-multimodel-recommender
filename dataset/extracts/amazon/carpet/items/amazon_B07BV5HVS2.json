                "reviewText": "I am giving this rug 5 stars with one reservation. It was so tightly wound in a very flat oval that it created hard to remove creases in the rug. I had to hose it down in the driveway and step on folds to remove them. It took several days of same procedure. Not a big deal I know, but customers buying this will not have a ready to use rug by any means. The design is BEAUTIFUL and the quality is great. I am not unhappy at all. I would recommend it with the caveat that it has major creases in the rug.",
