The only thing I would recommend is to purchase a roll of rug tape. It doesn\u2019t have any slip resistant features on it and slid very easily on the tile until we used the tape. Overall and excellent rug!",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of the rainbow rugs for my dog's room. I have two fur babies and like to have rugs in their room for them to jump down onto when they are getting out of their beds onto slippery wooden floors.My observations:. They are not non slip. I've had to place them under the feet of both beds so they won't slide across the room when the girls jump down on them.. They don't take cleaning very well. I tried cleaning one of them where there was some mud on it and it smeared and never \"recovered\" from the cleaning. I used a name brand carpet cleaner on a soft cloth but the rug stayed flat in the spot I cleaned and felt funny. I made sure none of the product was left in the rug, but wound up cutting off about 12 inches on one end so I wouldn't have to see it or feel it.. The colors are pretty but not as pronounced as in the pictures.. The rug does have good floof to it but it cannot be vacuumed as in the pictures. It has to be taken outside and beaten or shook. Even on the easiest setting on any of my 3 vacuum cleaners, they eat it!. For the price it's a decent deal, but this will not be a long term relationship.I would recommend this for a very low traffic area as the floof is very soft and has good loft, but I don't see it lasting any length of time.",
