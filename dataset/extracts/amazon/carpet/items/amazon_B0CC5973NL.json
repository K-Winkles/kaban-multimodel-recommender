I don\u2019t even want to put this out. It\u2019s just bad.It\u2019s a shame the image is so bad, because the rug is super soft and bound along the edges well.

But that is how it looks in the photos, so I would say it appears as I expected based don the photos.Quite a bit of detail and color in the image. Might not be very neutral or match all room color palettes, but if you have a setup that matches it works well.Usually prefer thicker pile, but this works and feels comfortable to walk on.Appearance is fairly subjective for rugs, but quite content with this one, and it matched well with the area and decor I had in mind.Likes:- Washable.- Vibrant colors.- Plenty of detail in the design.Dislikes:- Prefer a heavier / thicker base to support a rug and hold it's shape/place better.",
