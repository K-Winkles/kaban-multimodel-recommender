                "reviewText": "We have two cats that love to tear up carpeting, rugs, and upholstered furniture. We got this rug because a) it looked like it would fit the decor, but b) more importantly, it seemed like it wouldn't attract their claws. We put it in the center of our bedroom (currently painted concrete floor) under our king-size bed, and so far, it's been great. Our bed is upholstered and they've scratched the cr@p out of it, even now that it's on top of the rug, and they've stretched and tried to dig their claws into this rug, but they haven't actively scratched the rug yet, so I'd call that a success.We'd like to buy this rug in more sizes in this pattern for our bedroom, because it's very pretty.Oh, in case you're wondering, it arrives folded in plastic packaging, like a sealed bag. You just unfold the rug where you want it and it settles eventually.I highly recommend this rug, in the blue and white pattern. It's beautiful and very easy to manage. I haven't had to clean a spill up, yet, but it vacuums easily.The only thing I'd caution is that it feels a bit slippery on socked feet.",

                "reviewText": "This is the perfect rug for our guest room. We got the 8x10 and it fits the area beautifully. It's soft under foot and is super easy to clean. Our dog tracked a bit of mud in and we didn't notice until it was dried. We were able to vacuum up the dirt easily and dabbed out the rest with a wet cloth. No leftover stain. Rug looks good as new. Would definitely recommend if your looking for a solid area rug at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "This rug is exactly what I have been looking for! It stays flat and doesn't roll up. It's not fluffy or thick but it's comfortable. It's light enough to carry upstairs to wash but heavy enough to look expensive. lolI was hestiant about the color because I two very active kids under 5yrs old and 3 small dogs. The color is AMAZING BTW! I took a chance because it says it's machine washable. I have a full size front loader and it fits. I've washed it THREE times already and it looks like new every single time. The bottom doesn't peel or lose it's shape (like other rugs). I run it in a regular cycle with oxy clean and tide pods. Then, let it air dry over the stair rail. My guests love it and my neighbor asked to share the link for it. I am EXTREMELY impressed with this rug. I can't recommend it enough! For reference, I bought the 8x10.",
