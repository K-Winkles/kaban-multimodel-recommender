The top surface is a bit more coarse than a normal rug, which his expected. I have bought another entry way rug where the top is fuzzy and smooth. Not sure why you would want something that delicate for a heavy traffic area. I think this will last quite a while and since it's machine washable, it should be easy maintenance.The anti slip coating seems high quality and won't lose its tackiness over time. This rug isn't going to slip and slide. My old rugs had trouble staying in one place despite my best effort with rug tape.",
