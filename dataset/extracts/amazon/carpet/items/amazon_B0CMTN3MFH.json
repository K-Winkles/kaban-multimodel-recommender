                "reviewText": "For the most part I like this rug. I got the beige variety, but it's more like \"greige\", which is what I wanted. It has both grey and beige, which goes well in my bedroom.The carpet is lightweight and relatively easy to spread out. It takes a few days for all of the ripples to want to lay flat.The rug has a decently grippy backing to prevent it from sliding too much; however, I can't say the same about the actual walking surface of the rug. The carpet is extremely low-piled, but amazingly soft feeling. So soft; however, that it's actually a bit slippery. You heard me right, my feet can slide on the carpet, not to the extreme like hardwood or vinyl flooring, but still slippery nonetheless. This is one of the flaws with this rug. It's so soft & smooth that's it's actually a bit slippery.Another issue is, it's not easy to vacuum with my upright. I had to set my vacuum to the highest pile, even though this carpet has an extremely low pile. The rug wants to get sucked up into the vacuum when I run the upright vacuum over it. I guess because the carpet is more blanket-like, than rug-like. I suppose my round robotic (like a Roomba) vacuum will have to be used instead, since that vacuum seems to be fine on this rug.",
