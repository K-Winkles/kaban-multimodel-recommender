                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE rug for small price",
                "reviewText": "I wanted a rug to place next to my bed so I would have less hardwood floor under my feet when I got out of bed, and so that my dogs would have a nice place to lie down when we all go to sleep. I started out just looking to order a smaller 3x5 rug, but saw this rug at a better price, and decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived and I unpacked it to find such a large fluffy rug. I knew it was large, but it seems even larger when it is laid out on my floor! It is so extremely soft and fluffy. It is definitely a rug that requires a good vacuum, which sadly I no longer have since I have hardwood floors throughout my house. When the dogs eat \"cookies\" on the rug, small pieces will definitely get stuck down in the fibers and you WILL step on them in your bare feet and feel it, so you have to either pick up the rug and shake it out, or vacuum it (which again, I cannot do at this time). Fortunately, wet messes are easy to clean up, and wipe right up, even with the deep fluff. It is pretty repellent and stuff wipes off without much effort. My new dog had just had surgery and he dripped a little blood on one spot and I quickly wiped it up with a damp cloth and it came right out without leaving anything behind. It claims to be machine washable, and recommends placing it in a garment bag to do so, but I have not done so yet. I do plan to try and wash it just to see how it holds up, and to get the food particles out.It is a nice, soft, comfortable rug for your bare feet (until you have food particles, or goat head stickers stuck in the fibers), and I would honestly recommend it to anyone looking for a rug that isn't too fancy. The price is well worth it, and it holds up well to lots of traffic both human and animal (Pitbull mix and a Great Dane).",

The material is very comfy to sit on!I bought this just to fill a space where my old rug was, I was honestly skeptical.. great price, great blurb.. too good to be true... but! It happily surprised me! It's really soft, feels great, it doesn't move or shift as you walk on it as much as I expected. It isn't as thick as I'd hoped but for the price it's excellent!Soild 4.5 stars! :D",

                "reviewText": "I read a lot of great reviews about these rugs so I thought I'd give them a shot for my kids' rooms. They were very reasonably priced too. When they arrived, they were so tightly vacuumed sealed that I thought for sure they would be complete duds and would be getting returned. Boy was I wrong! Once we opened them, they fluffed right up and they are so incredibly soft!! I ordered the white and the light pink and both are very nice. They have very light rubber backing, kind of like the bottom of an indoor slipper, but it helps keep them in place on hard floors. The white one has been shedding a little, but no more than any other new carpet would shed. I haven't had them that long to say how they will hold up, but overall, I am satisfied with my purchase!",
