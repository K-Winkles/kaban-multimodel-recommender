The way it is designed, it\u2019s almost impossible to vacuum, even with a shop vac stuff just gets wrapped up in the fabric. It also stains very easy as being so thinly filled it stains right down to the bottom almost immediately. Multiple attempts to clean the stain only clean the fabric part and not the base. With it being so thin the stain is very visible.I would not recommend this for a kids room or any high traffic area or with pets. Basically if you have a room that never gets used.",
