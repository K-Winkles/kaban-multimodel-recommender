                "reviewText": "I really like how this rug looks on the floor. It brings a simple, yet unique look to the room. Gives it a bit of an alchemist's lab atmosphere. The black is surprisingly attractive. The rug is more like a tapestry or thick piece of cloth than what I usually think of. There is no pile. It's still soft. It does not stick to my bare feet. It softens sounds on hardwood floors. And my dog and cat do like to lay on it. It does a decent job of not sliding around too much, although I'm thinking of reinforcing that with a bit of carpet tape.My rug came a little bit less bright than the pictures led me to believe. It's fine, but it's not as crisp as the photos. This would not fit in spaces I need a doormat, so I placed it in front of my tv, which is a a place frequently walked through. I'm not sure how well it will hold up to high traffic, but this is not an investment rug, and it cleans up easily given its light weight.",
