It\u2019s not super noticeable unless you\u2019re looking for it. I was worried about quality because others said it is basically a throw blanket. I get the analogy because it has the same feel but it does have the backing of a rug. It\u2019s on the thinner side but soft/padded to walk on. It ships folded up in a box but lays down well. Overall, it\u2019s awesome for the price. I\u2019ve wanted a large, trendy styled rug but was not in the position to spend $300+. Would recommend.",

I didn't realize how soft/plush it is- which isn't a bad thing, but not for an entryway where 3 people and 3 pets come and go everyday. Within a couple of days it's showing dirt pretty badly. I ordered a second rug so I can have one clean to put down every couple of days while the other is washing/drying as a remedy but I doubt at that rate they will last even a year, so.. They're nice, soft and cleanable but it just wasn't the best choice for high traffic.",

Not really related to the quality, but I tried to vacuum it to help with the fibers laying in different directions and it did not go well. Stuff is already sticking to it and the vacuum (Dyson Animal 3) couldn\u2019t go over it without it getting stuck, even with my bed holding it down. If it hadn\u2019t been almost $100, I wouldn\u2019t complain, but I would not have gotten this rug if I had see this review.",

The white under the green squares doesn\u2019t bother me; I knew going into this purchase that I\u2019m not going to get a top knotch rug for $100; but for what I paid for, the size, presentation, and softness is really worth it.5 stars",
