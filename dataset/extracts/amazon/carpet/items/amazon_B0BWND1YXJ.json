                "reviewText": "Updated 12/3/22: Rug still works and serves it purpose. I did have to wash it, and had no issues. BUT, I washed on a delicate cycle with only clorox laundry sanitizer. No other detergent or fabric softener. Then I let it hang dry (do not put in dryer!) And once dried I used my hand and just \"petted\" the rug back to \"fluffiness\". Sorry, I have no other way to describe how I did this. I have used my vacuum on it, no issues there. But I was very careful and went slowly, holding down corners of the rug with my feet while I vacuumed. It still looks good, still feels good, so I am definitely happy with this purchase.Ok, so we just installed new flooring and needed an area rug until we purchased the \"end game\" rugs (you know, the rugs you REALLY want but haven't chose yet). So I saw this rug for about $40 and bought it as the quick fix. I got the 5x7 mottled blue and super happy with it. It has now earned a permanent place in our living room. It's not \"high end\" quality, but it is fluffy (give it a day in a warm, dry room and shake it out a few times) and really soft on bare feet. It is NOT machine washable. I haven't cleaned it yet (no need to... yet) but when I do, I will be spot cleaning it with a cloth and warm water only. It looks gray in a couple of my photos, I turned on the flash to show the blue color. Really, the dark is a navy blue color while the lighter is a blue/gray shade (think storm clouds). Overall, pleased with the purchase and would buy this again.",
