I'm sure this is what helps it to be so soft to the touch, although I do not consider it cushiony. I purchased for bedside so not high traffic area. I put foam tiles beneath mine which gives it padding, and hopefully helps the light weight backing hold up better. The rug does seem to stay in place fairly well with its little rubber dot design on back. My biggest concern, does it vacuum easily? That is a YES! Nice rug for the money",

It is more for children, teens, and dorms where hard wear and tear go with the territory. I got it to go under an indoor tent for a toddler to mitigate my hard, cold tile floor. The gray is attractive and it is soft underfoot, but here and there you can see through the fibers down to the matting. I think it\u2019s tacky, but I didn\u2019t choose it to be a showpiece.",

I read the reviews before purchasing and didn't want to spend too much money because I was not sure of the quality. Reviews complaining that it was too thin, was basically a blanket for the floor, and smelled like chemicals. I am overjoyed with the actual rugs. Very fluffy and soft. Can I feel the hardwood floor underneath the rug? yes. But it's moreso like a bath mat quality though. I have not tried to vaccum it yet since I need a low powered vaccum for it. Does it smell of chemicals? not in my opinion. Smelled a bit like elmers glue when I first put them on the floor. It wasn't an overwhelming chemical smell. I did not need to open my windows to air it out. The glue scent went away in about 5 hours. The 4x6 rug came vacuum packed and fluffed up immediately after bag was cut open. The 2x6 rug was not vacuum packed, and is a bit slippery. The 4x6 was not slippery.I plan on ordering more and covering my entire bedroom floor in this lovely winter white color. It reminds me of walking on snow. I love it.",

The fibers are long and glossy. The only complaint I'd make is it's very light, so the corners get turned up easily. But for the price, it is a bargain!",
