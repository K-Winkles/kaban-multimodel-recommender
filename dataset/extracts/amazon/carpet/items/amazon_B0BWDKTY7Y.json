Because the bedroom rug is made of extra soft velvet, there is a high-density foam interlayer that gives you a very soft touch.",
            "NON-SLIP: This 2x6 rug has a non-slip bottom designed to prevent slips and falls. The bottom of the area rug has thousands of PVC dots which will keep the floor under your rug from being damaged while keeping your rug from sliding when you walk around.",
            "CLEAN: Vacuuming is recommended once a week. If you have stains on your rugs for bedroom, you can do spot cleaning. You can use carpet shampoo on the carpet and scrub it clean with a small area using a soft bristle brush or rag.",
            "DECORATIVE: Shaggy rugs are durable enough for any room in your home where you spend the most time, like the living room and bedroom. Get a fluffy shag rug to provide cozy comfort to a hardwood floor to deliver visual interest to an uninspired entryway.",
            "NOTE: In order to facilitate delivery, our carpets are vacuum packed. So when you first open the package, there will be creases on the carpet, and the plush will not stand up. Don't worry, lay the carpet out on the floor for 3-5 days and it will regain its furry feel."

The rug is fluffy but not as thick as i expected either for context I bought a $120 rug from walmart also and its definitely not the same thickness but it was just taken out the packaging 10 min ago so maybe i need to let it fluff up? Idk Ill come back with an update tomorrow. As far as sizing I read the description and reviews and if youre anything like me you terrible at sizing. This is a 5x8 and it matches what I wanted. The rug is HUGE! Which is my favorite part. Definitely worth the $35",

It is an unusual material, more like a stuffed animal or furry clothes, not something typically made for walking on. When you step on it, it's soft and lovely, but there is no density to the material so you sink to the underlayment and slide around a bit. It's a weird feeling and hard to explain. Perfect for a kids room to lay around on, not perfect for a main part of the house IMO. To clean it, it's light enough to just pick up and shake out - I'm not sure a vacuum would be advisable.",
