I really wasn't expecting it to be so soft and fluffy! It's also big and beautiful! I love the design and the grey is the perfect shade. It could match anything. It really pulls my room together.Our floors are hard and my toddler hates being on them. He actually played and laid on this rug all day. I think he likes it just as much as me. It seems to be well made too. I added padding underneath mine for extra cushioning but it's not necessary. The corners laid flat fast. I set a book on them and they were fine after a couple hours.My rug did come half unwrapped and it was dirty on the side that was wrapped. I won't remove a star though because I do love the rug and the dirt came off with my scrubber.",

                "reviewText": "I will start by saying that \"cozy\" items like rugs ,throws, pillows etc. are my weakness and I have an abundance of all! With that being said, this Nautica rug looks and feels like it was made for me! It is made with exceptional quality, thick and incredible soft. So luxurious and plush. Our pups love to just lay on it all day and I don't blame them! The print is beautiful and looks just like the listing photos. It vacuums easily and doesn't appear to shed. We have not had to clean it yet aside of vacuuming, so I will update as needed!",

A beautiful statement piece in my front room.The white and black style is a bright white, and the dark details look even better than pictured.The material is fluffy, with the bounce back of a cotton ball. Feels great to sit/walk/lay on.It is a bit lumpy for the first week while the backer straightens out.This is not a high quality twisted poly like you would find in a carpet-limiting the life of this rug. This is my second one, the first was in a high traffic area and lost thickness and changed texture.I place this in a low traffic area of my home to enjoy it longer. Hope this is helpful!",

I finally did the other day when I was putting together some furniture, it was just as wonderful as I thought it would be!! It's heaven to walk on and look at. I've found its easy to spot clean too. I am so pleased and I absolutely recommend this.",

It's very soft and it's great neutral rug that can go with pretty much anything. I am not sure it's a rug that you could use a carpet cleaner with so be advised if you have pets or kids (spot cleaning only). Overall, if you like the style of the rug that you will love it! I hope this was helpful! Have a beautiful day! :)",

The only issue is some bleeding of colors I\u2019m spots and there was some pinkish or reddish blotch on one area as pictured. Not a big deal for me as it was going partially under the bed and wouldn\u2019t be seen. Not too noticeable even if it wasn\u2019t hidden. Recommend!",
