                "reviewText": "I got this runner to cover some torn carpet spots that one of my lovely dogs tore up\u2026as well as to hopefully deter accidents from another dog.To start, this carpet is SUPER soft and lovely to walk on. The colors are vibrant and the print matches the description to a tee. The back is perfectly rubberized\u2026on wood floors, I\u2019m sure it\u2019d stay put. Naturally it moves a bit on carpet but that\u2019s to be expected.The tiny flaw is that when the fabric is rubbed in the opposite direction, it doesn\u2019t seem to be fully dyed on every fiber. But it\u2019s not a huge deal.The BIGGEST pro for me is, sadly, it has not deterred my older dog from her newfound fixation with having accidents in that area. That\u2019s not the pro obviously haha! The pro is, I\u2019ve washed this runner rug 3-4x\u2019s now and it\u2019s still good as new! Machine washable, and dryer friendly, this rug has not lost any fibers or had issues being washed multiple times. I\u2019ve had this runner for approx. 3-4 months, the pics were taken just before this review, and it still looks great!",

It is definitely a cheap rug, the design is sprayed on so it doesn\u2019t look expensive or anything. But it\u2019s perfect for our needs. Also I found that I was able to work out the creases almost immediately.",

My only complaint is that it\u2019s very difficult to vacuum, cause it\u2019s basically a large bath mat. My vacuum sucks it right up unless I set it to a specific series of settings (turn down the suction, set it to bare floor) and then I can avoid ruining the rug or the vacuum. I clean a lot bc we are a multi pet household. But I don\u2019t regret buying it because it\u2019s very soft and very pretty!",

This is being used in our nursery therefore not sure how it\u2019ll hold up over time of being walked on and such but the colors blend very well with her pastel rainbow colors theme. We wanted something to subtlety stand out from rainbows and this fits the colors while doing that! I\u2019ve vacuumed it once so far and it held up well but we\u2019ve not yet had our baby girl so traffic on it hasn\u2019t been much yet.",
