I thought there's no way it's going to open to a huge rug without creases but amazingly, it did. It was kind of cool watching it come to life. Lol",

Listen to the other reviewers as well when they say the value and quality is poor. Honestly though $80 is cheap compared to other area rugs right? I\u2019m glad I got a different one that actually suits my wants and needs for maybe $40 more which was totally worth it. There may be some pros to this item but I didn\u2019t even check them out or notice any right away. The item came and I was shocked by how small for a padded rug, well that\u2019s because there is HARDLY and padding at all. Non slip where because it literally fleece on my hardwood floor just sliding around. It\u2019s so flimsy and cheap I think the material would fall apart in a washer honestly. So don\u2019t suggest that. And it smelled slightly like chemicals which wouldn\u2019t have even been a con for me if the whole item wasn\u2019t a con in itself. It\u2019s think like a blanket I mean my blanket is probably actually thicker than the rug to be honest which is sad. Maybe if it was a decent rug made well and thinner sure. But it has nothing substantial about it I can find and is back in a box to be returned. Just save yourself time and please buy something else.",

I liked the packaging as it was compressed when it came in and unfolded nicely, It says that it will get thicker in 48hrs, the video shows is 3hrs after laying it flat. It\u2019s a good product and I definitely recommend for anyone looking for area rugs in the house. It looks easy to clean and pick up as it isn\u2019t very heavy. It\u2019s perfect for me.",

                "reviewText": "This rug reminded me more of a blanket than a rug. It's light weight and the backing is really thin with some texture that I assume is supposed to help with grip. If you put a piece of furniture on it, it may be non-slip, but alone it will most definitely slide around. It arrived vacuum sealed, about the size of a bath towel and I purchased the largest one offered 6x9 feet. I purchased the dark green and it is NOT even close to a match. The rug I received isn\u2019t a bad color, but simply, not a match to what is shown here. The rug is VERY soft though. I can\u2019t imagine you could really vacuum this rug with a standup vacuum given how lightweight it is. Ultimately, I returned it because it\u2019s not really a rug at all and I was bothered by that and concerned about the longevity.",
