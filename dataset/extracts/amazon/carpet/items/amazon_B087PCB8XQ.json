My only complaint is, its really hard to clean if you have it in a high traffic area.

                "reviewText": "I read reviews saying that it's super thin and that's true. It's soft and the color is really pretty (I got the pink). I just want it to go under my dining room table so it's no big deal to me that it's so thin. It'll make it easier to shake out (I think). I ran it through the dryer on delicate to help with the creases and it worked fine. There's still some creasing but it'll smooth out over time. It looks cute under my table. For the price it's great. If you're going to lay it over carpet that would probably work for a children's room or play area, but not on a bare floor. I'm going to get one now for my tiny patio for summer. Oh, and you can always get rug padding to go under it if you want something softer.",

She got, what I can only descibe as a red wax like substance on it in more than one place. Of course I blew my top and tried patiently to explain about taking care of her belongs. We only had the rug for a week. I figured it was ruined. Turns out it was a melted red gummy bear that was on it. But after much debating with myself I took it to the restroom sink. I got out my bottle of cleaner and figured what's the worst that could happen. I pretreated and scrubbed gently. After rinsing I put it n the washer, cold/ gentle cycle. Air fluff in dryer and to my amazement. No stains at all. Not even a hint. Good as new! We're talking turquoise with bright red stains. I'm so happy. 100% satisfied customer. Will be purchasing again real soon. Oh and a great price too. I highly recommend.",
