It's super soft, doesn't look too thin like some cheap shag rugs, and it doesn't slip at all. The only issue is that it's so soft it's slippery; not so much that I can't walk on it, but I think I would not recommend it for households with elderly people just in case. Color was true to pictures, and I haven't cleaned it yet but it does seem to be machine washable.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start out by saying I was a total skeptic when this arrived in the mail, mostly because it arrived as a tiny vacuum sealed square and I was expecting an actual hard back rug coming in a roll.Smell: After opening it up it does have a slight smell as others mention. It smells like when you get a fresh memory foam mattress. It\u2019s not horrible, definitely better than some real rugs I\u2019ve gotten but the smell is there though I expect it to dissipate.Slippery: okay others had mentioned it was slippery and I can kind of see it, it\u2019s a slick fur and my kids already mentioned how cool it is to just slide across it. It\u2019s not unsafe walking on it like ice but I can see where this slippery comment came from. Furniture may not stay put on it because of this.Backing: it has a nonslip backing which isn\u2019t very grippy like say trampoline or non slip socks, I have stuff on top of the rug so this isn\u2019t a big deal but it is nice that the rug is slightly thick and padded. This was purchased for a kids room to look like grass so they are loving the softness to just chill on the floor.Cozy: brings a cozy vibe to the roomDurability: TBD, will need to see how this holds up long term and vacuuming.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the DweIke Super Soft Shaggy Rug in the Deep-Green color, and I have mixed feelings about it. Let's start with the positives: I absolutely love the vibrant green color, which adds a lively touch to my living room. Additionally, the rug is incredibly soft and comfortable to walk on, providing a cozy and inviting feel to the space.However, there are a couple of aspects that left me somewhat disappointed. Firstly, the rug gives off a strong and unpleasant odor during the first few weeks. It took some time for the smell to dissipate, which was quite bothersome. While it eventually faded away, it was not the most pleasant experience in the beginning.Secondly, I couldn't help but notice that the rug feels somewhat cheaply made. The materials used seem to lack durability, and I worry about its long-term longevity. It doesn't have the same sturdy and well-crafted feel as other rugs I've owned in the past.That being said, I must emphasize that the DweIke Shaggy Rug does serve its purpose in terms of adding a pop of color and a soft texture to my room. It's not a high-end or luxury option, but it does provide a decent level of comfort and aesthetics for the price point.In conclusion, if you're looking for an affordable rug that adds a splash of color and coziness to your living space, the DweIke Super Soft Shaggy Rug could be a suitable choice. Just be prepared for the initial odor and keep in mind that it may not have the same durability as higher-end options. It's a decent option for those on a budget, but if you're seeking long-term quality, you may want to explore other alternatives.",
