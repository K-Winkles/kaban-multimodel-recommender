I haven't had it long enough to know how it will hold up, but it's just gorgeous in my living room.It comes shrink-wrapped in squares, which is odd, so it does take some time on the floor to flatten out and lose those weird lines from the folding. But they do go away after a few weeks. Would be better to come rolled, but as is, this is a good rug.I'm not sure how easy it will be to clean, though. It's very shaggy and furry and soft (all the things I love about it), but cleaning it after a fur ball incident? Not so sure.[Update: this rug is just lovely! It's so soft to walk on, but it is very thin, so if you have it on a hardwood floor (as I do), you may want to think about a carpet under it. When you kneel on it, you might as well be on the hard wood, it's that thin. Still, for the price, LOVE IT.]",

(It\u2019s so hard to tell what the faux fur will be like from online pix)To my surprise (& happiness), it\u2019s great! Long, but not too long fur/rug, very white, easy to vacuum AND plush. Feels so nice to walk on!Had just over a week so longevity is still TBD, but it feels like it will last. My daughter & I are both pleased. May have to buy another for big sister\u2019sroom!",

                "reviewText": "So I have 2 of these rugs now because I bought one and was so pleased with it that I scooped up another one when I saw it was on sale. First I bought the light purple gray, I love the color and and also love that the backing is cushioned, unlike most rugs. The second one I got was light pink, love this color also. This makes it very soft and pleasing to sit on. I bought the 4' x. 6' size for both, which is large enough to cover my sofa and put on my bed to protect both from my big dog.I had bought a sofa cover that was quilted cloth, but that was torn up in about a week. These rugs really hold up well, AND they also don't shed their shag. I bought a shag rug on sale from WalMart and have retired it already, as it lacked the soft cushy feel that these have, AND it shed all over the place - could not stand up to big or little dog. I had to pull pieces of shag from that rug from their toenails, it was not good. But these rugs, no problem, they really hold up. I have no idea how I will clean them when the time comes as they won't fit in the washer, but thus far they are fine.They did stink up a storm when first unwrapped, but I think that can't be helped with something that's been shrink wrapped and stored for a while. I hung them outside and beat them a little and that helped dissipate the smell, but it really took about 3 days or so for the smell to dissipate fully. You might want to unwrap them outside if you have a small or not well ventilated space.All in all I give these five stars, they are soft, cushy, comfy, do not shed, and totally hold up well to my big dog the destroyer of all nice things. I am planning to buy more of these rugs to cover another sofa and a giant 4' x 6' pillow seat that I bought for myself to young on in the home office when I need a break, but which has somehow turned into big dog's office bed lol.Oh and they do a great job of protecting the furniture from his drool as well as his teeth and toenails.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these 2x6 gray runners to use on each side of my king sized bed. I should have known how cheaply made these were for the price. It's too much trouble to send them back, so I'm keeping them.These are flimsy and I am pretty sure they won't make it through one laundry cycle. No way I'm hand washing these rugs, but that's what the instructions suggested.They are soft, yes. But pretty thin, and the backing is almost like a flexible Styrofoam and I can't imagine I'll get much use out of them before they disintegrate.The odor wasn't as bad s expected, and they do stay in place on my hardwoods, so the non slip material seems to be doing its job.I would not buy these rugs again.Update 10/09/2023 after having these two rugs for several months: They have not worn well. I've washed them a few times and they look worse and worse every time. They are flat and have the texture of shag carpet that's been in a home for the past 50 years.",
