The front of the rug should rest a few inches in front of your sofa. If you are placing the rug under a coffee table, make sure that it can accommodate all four legs of the table. Larger rooms typically require a rug that is between 6\u2019 x 9\u2019 - 8\u2019 x 10\u2019. Place the front legs of the sofa on top of the rug. If you prefer, all four legs may also rest completely on the rug surface. Leaving a space of 18\"-24\" on all sides of the rug will create a border to frame your living space. If your current set up features furniture floating in the center of the room, we recommend at least a 9\u2019 x 12\u2019. An equal amount of floor space (between 12\u201d - 18\u201d) should be left on all sides if possible. All furniture should sit completely on the rug surface without looking cramped.",

It perfectly blends in our apartment and is not too overpowering. We used this as an area rug for out living room with dark wood floors, a dark wooden chest, and light colored couch. The rug was easily unrolled and had no problem flattening it out on the first day. The backing of the rug is sturdy and hardly slips on wooden floors. I did put a rug mat beneath it just for extra grip but with furniture on top of it, this was probably not needed. The rug arrived a week before the expected delivery date and I was thrilled to receive a nice note from the seller to let me know about the quality care the rug was getting on its way to me.Highly recommend!",

This one has fulfilled all expectations, so far. The colour was a bit too pink when I first rolled it out but now I don't mind that at all. And I have read about bad odours and that it won't lay flat. I had no issues. A bit of a smell of a new synthetic rug but dissipated rather quickly. Put a coupla heavy items on the corners for about a day and no roll up since. Looks great in the room, feels good under foot.",

This is probably one of the best purchases I've made in the home acescories department!The colors are beautiful, I know that is a very typical remark to make about rugs, but this one truly has vivid and rich colors. Its vivid without being ghetto lookkng. Haha! :-) The lines in the patterns are great too, your eyes can see the shapes within the design with ease.It goes great with my India/Bohemian themed bedroom- elephants and all. You know something is quality when it can compliment even the elephant accent table. Right?I like to think so.Honestly, I can't find anything negative about this rug. In case anyone is a rug expert, yes- it has the big-huge-massive tag woven into the back that certifies, qualifys, adopts, accepts, loves, and says whatever else about the rug.Dimensions seem true to size as well.Whoever says the colors are dull on this rug... Good God! You are one colorblind sea-sponge, my friend.Very pleased! Don't procrastinate for five months like I did; just stick this sucker in your shopping cart and slam your cursor onto the order button.PRODUCT ORDERED: nuLOOM RZBD32A - COLOR: Pink. - SIZE: 3'X5'",

This beautiful carpet has made it even more perfect and paid off the price!We added a 0.5 inch rug pad to add to the thickness to be able to sit on the bench for more hours. It helps.It also works perfectly without the pad, however we just needed one more layer because it\u2019s put on the wood.Love it \ud83d\ude0d",
