                "reviewText": "On first impression, this is a nice looking, reasonably priced rug -- not a genuine Persian by any means, but good value for the price, with a nice pattern and good coloration. And then you notice the wrinkles.We have had this rug on our floor for a month now, installed over a 3/8 inch felt pad. There was a series of wrinkles on it when we first unrolled it, but we felt those would relax with time. They didn't. So I laid sheets over the wrinkles and placed 2\" x 10\" x 8' planks on the sheets. After a week, the wrinkles were still there. So I added the weight of our 8 foot long electric reclining sofa on top of the planks over the largest wrinkle. After another week, the wrinkles were still there.As you can see in my photo, the wrinkles appear to originate with a single wrinkle near the end of the rug -- the end of the rug that was rolled up first and tightest -- and are repeated at regular intervals as more of the rug was rolled up over the initial wrinkle.The rug came to us with the top surface rolled up on the inside, and the bottom surface on the outside. By comparison, we bought a slightly smaller rug from the local discount/membership store and it came with the top surface outside on the roll -- and no wrinkles, not even a little one. Coincidence? Lucky? A different manufacturer? Who knows? All I know is that we've got a pretty tacky looking rug right in the middle of our newly remodeled living room, and the return period has expired.I can't imagine that I would ever buy this brand of rug again.Update January 6, 2016: another reviewer mentioned that he had the same issue with wrinkles in his rug when he first unrolled it. He suggested that, if I was patient and gave the rug time to relax, the wrinkles might eventually relax out. I really appreciated his advice and suggestion, but unfortunately I have not had the same experience that he did. It's been about 2 months since we put the rug on the floor, and the 2 largest wrinkles are still there -- somewhat reduced in size, but still very noticeable. I suppose I could try moving the furniture of the edges of the rugs, roll up the rug, roll up the pad and store it, then put the rug and furniture back in place, but that would be a major pain. I'll keep watching for signs of improvement, but for now, my opinion is unchanged.I can't imagine that I would ever buy this brand of rug again.Update on May 23, 2017: Well, good things come to those who wait, as the Brits say. The wrinkles are gone and have been gone for probably 6 months, perhaps a bit more. The rug looks good, shows no signs of wear, and is comfortable underfoot. So I guess it comes down to how long a person is willing to wait for a rug to completely relax. I'm going to increase my rating to 4 stars, with the 5th star withheld due to the long process of waiting for the wrinkles to relax, because, other than that problem, it's a very nice rug.A person recently commented that, based on my photo, the blue color was more intense than that person wanted. The color is actually quite a bit less intense than shown in the picture, and almost more of a blue/gray.",

                "reviewText": "I inherited my house from my father when he passed away and have 5 kids, two dogs and six cats. My father installed white carpet in one of the rooms. Between five kids and eight animals the white carpet has, needless to say, gotten filthy. Even deep steam cleaning can\u2019t hide all the stains. So I got this rug and one of the larger Rectangular rugs to accent the room and cover the stains. I also own 4 Persian rugs that cost 10s of thousands of dollars. The last thing I wanted was the expensive rugs to get ruined so I found these and thought I\u2019d give them a try. They are beautiful, sturdy, thick, soft and gorgeous! I highly recommend them for any home!!They do come rolled and you can see the round one I just put out has some ripples (I haven\u2019t vacuumed it yet so you can see the before with the ripples and the rectangular one that flattened out) -with vacuuming and time they flatten out just fine. Patience is a virtue. No area rug lies flat at first, they all come rolled. These are so nice it\u2019s hard to tell these apart from the ones that cost thousands!!",

I do hope that, in time the creases will go away. That remains to be seen. The color shown on Amazon is much lighter. The color posted in my picture is the true color. Rug is on the thinner side but I have a padding under which makes a huge difference.",
