The pink color is very light but perfect for what I wanted as well. The only con is the thickness of it the rug because we\u2019ll there is no thickness. It is very thin which it makes it feel a bit cheap. I showed you in my pictures. There\u2019s nothing for it to be non-slip so if you have it in a spot where it would move a lot, it will move a lot. Luckily for me I have it in a position where it can\u2019t move. Regardless I love this rug and highly suggest it to add some color into your room.",

It was just unnerving when I opened the package and laid the rug down there were tiny flying bugs crawling around the rug. I vacuumed the rug and it got rid of them and all the other things that were in the rug but I shouldn't have to open something and there to be bugs. Other than that, now that I cleaned it and has been in my new room I love it.",
