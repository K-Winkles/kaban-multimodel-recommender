                "reviewText": "I think the rugs are beautiful. I ordered the rugs in almost every size. They are beautiful, soft to touch and very soft on the feet. Incredibly soft to be honest with you. They stay in place, and really did exceed my expectations. If I had one negative, I wish they were a tad bit darker but I do not regret buying them. I bought the red multi colored ones. Although they may get dirty quicker because of the lighter colors in the rug, the rugs are washable so I'm not worried; just wash with care. These were well priced, and I would definitely purchase them again. I highly recommend them most definitely!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my grandbaby's room (blue) and living room (multi red) and the colors match up beautifully. I am very happy that the red one is not as dark as the pictures seen in the advertisement. Also it's more burgundy than red.It is very soft and non slip since it has a \"rubber\" backing. Soooo happy that I bought it. It helps now when our crawling grandbaby comes over. Our adult children like it too. No more hard floors to sit on. It's not padded as a normal rug but at least it does help sitting on a hard floor and it's soft.Not sure if a regular vacuum should be used on it. It may get sucked up into it.And this 5x7 is probably too large for my front load washer. Maybe rolling or folding it up would help with that?It lays flat. Not sure about stain resistance since it's new.",
