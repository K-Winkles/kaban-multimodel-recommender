                "reviewText": "I needed a 4x6 rug in my entryway. I was looking for something thin with a bit of funky bohemian style that would wash well. This fit the bill.It doesn't feel like a typical rug - more like a really thick, old-style felt blanket with a backing. I wouldn't want it for other rooms except maybe a kid's room, playroom, or mudroom, but as a stylish yet easy to clean entryway rug, this is wonderful. It is soft, the print is as puctured though I took a star off as the print on the felt-type material comes out indistinct (though the overall distressed look hides that unless you look closely), our robot vacuum handles it beautifully, it washes well when it gets soiled by dirty shoes, and gives a nice place for visitors to slip off their shoes and put on guest slippers. We purchased two so that one could be down while the other was in the wash. So far, so good.One caution, this rug is lighter weight than most rugs. If you are planning on using an upright vacuum or an upright carpet cleaner on it, it will probably bunch up, get stuck and flop about. To clean it, I just shake it out off of the porch to get larger particles off and then machine wash it per the provided instructions. A robot vacuum, a handheld vacuum, and a handheld/spot carpet cleaner would be fine, but anything larger or with really strong suction will just be a headache so go the easy route and machine wash it instead.",
