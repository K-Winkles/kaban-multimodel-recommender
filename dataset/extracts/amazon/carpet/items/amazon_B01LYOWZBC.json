In the picture, the color looks tan and reddish, but in person, the color is a dark burgundy and grey. Here comes the crazy part. When I took the picture of the rug to show to my boyfriend, on the picture that I took, the color of the rug looks tan and reddish. The rug is in my laundry room, so it's fine with my decor in there. However, if it had been for a different room, I would have returned it.",

It's also easy to clean, and hides dirt (I have it in front of the entry) . I liked this so much that I bought 2 more in the other color for my hallways. It's a great value for what you get. You do need to get a rug pad to hold it in place so I bought the Gorilla Grip rug pad and it works perfectly.",
