I would not describe it as soft on the feet. I will say, however, the design is beautiful and it wears really well. It laid flat immediately, and from a distance, it looks like a very expensive rug. The color is exactly what I wanted and I\u2019ve found myself looking at it in a positive light multiple times a day.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve always had a runner rug over the tile in my front entryway/hallway (kids, pets) but I swear rug pads never work (and if they do, it\u2019s because they\u2019re really thick and prevent the basement door from opening) and I spend half my life adjusting the rug placement. This runner is extremely low pile with an actual rubber back! It protects the tile, is warmer on little feet, and stays in place, while allowing my doors to open. It also flattened out really quickly after placement. Pattern and color is as described. Is it fancy? Not really. Does it do exactly what I needed it to? 100%. Will I buy more? Highly likely.",

It would be so helpful if they included all colors vs just \u201cmulti\u201d as it is clearly orange and blue. I didn\u2019t even take it out of the package. I\u2019m returning it and trying out the all green one instead. Fingers crossed\u2026",
