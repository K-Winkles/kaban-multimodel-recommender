                "reviewText": "As other reviews have noted, this rug is super soft and fluffy \u2014 more like a pet mat than a regular carpet. My cat loves this. I needed a rug for insulation under my chair by my desk. The floor is really cold in the winter and my legs get cold, so I bought this rug for layer of insulation under the chair. It is perfectly suitable for this purpose. Some reviews say that these rugs are slippery to walk on \u2014 maybe so, but I won\u2019t be walking across this rug, so that\u2019s not a concern here. I just want it to stop the draft coming through the floorboards. Packaging: I was pleasantly surprised at how compact and lightweight this rug is, in the vacuum-packed wrapping. I wanted a rug that would be easy for me to carry up two flights of stairs, and this rug comes packed so small and lightweight, very easy to carry. It\u2019s amazing how big it expands when it comes out of the vacuum-pack. Keep in mind this is not heavy-duty carpet material. If you want a super-soft rug that would be great as a floor covering and comfortable for toddlers and pets, you will be very happy with this, especially for the price, it\u2019s a great value. Quality, size, color were all fine, no issues!",

I got the 4\u2019x6\u2019 in navy and it\u2019s true to both size and color. It was well packaged and came tightly wrapped. Once it was opened it fluffed up and spread out beautifully. I do have it on rug tape so it doesn\u2019t slide on the floor but honestly it\u2019s really good quality. Doesn\u2019t shed but is very soft. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a rug and not paying a ridiculous amount of money",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve struggled with how I should rate this product. There are things about it that I love. I\u2019ll begin by stating that it\u2019s not technically a rug. It\u2019s a mat. It\u2019s synthetic fur attached to a foam mat like one of those bath mats, only much larger. I like that because It\u2019s very light weight and super soft like rabbit fur. However, it\u2019s an example of something that on the surface seems like a good idea, but was clearly not thought through. It\u2019s very slick. Equivalent to walking on oil on a smooth surface. I would NOT walk across this carrying a baby nor would I let someone elderly walk across it. I slipped just in my bare feet. It is even more slippy in sock feet. I wanted something my toddler grandchild could sit and play on. It will serve this purpose as long as he doesn\u2019t fall and hurt himself. The sale price was fantastic and I do really like it even though it\u2019s truly not safe. Keeping it. Just beware and know that it may not be what you are expecting.",

After dropping off on the amazon drop off zone and somehow i find the rug on my door the next day.. Got half the money back and got stuck with a pink rug.If you are lucky and get correct colour, it is worth buying it. As it is so soft that I wanted to sleep with it..",
