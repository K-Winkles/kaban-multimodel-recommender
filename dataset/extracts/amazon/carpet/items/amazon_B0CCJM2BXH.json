                "reviewText": "The carpet is not thick at all so we laid it over the existing rug in the kid's gameroom we wanted it for. We have grands and made them a video/game/media room. We put a heavy console with 75\" TV and two overstuffed very large chairs on it. It is so soft we could slide heavy furniture over it with ease and it did not lose fiber. It is as soft as kitten fur and the weave is so tight, there are NO spots where you can see the base of the rug through the pile. Will definitely recommend this to people looking for a rug for their children to play on.",
