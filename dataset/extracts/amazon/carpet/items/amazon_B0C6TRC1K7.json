                "reviewText": "We use this in our toy room where there are hard floors. The rug is thin but it is still very soft and great quality. It doesn't move at all, and looks very elegant. It definitely compliments the room. Another added benefit is, the other day my son spilled a glass of water on it, and the rug did not absorb it at all. I was able to simply wipe the puddle up and the rug was just hardly damp where the water had been spilt.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I returned this rug because the color wasn't as vibrant as I wanted. I feel like it was fairly represented in the photos, but in my space it wasn't what I was looking for.That said, I bought the 9x12. Because the rug is thin, like a blanket as other reviewers mention, it's packaged folded which makes it easier to manage and bring into your home. It is quite soft and appears well made. The pattern is printed on the rug rather than created by individual fibers. Again, if you know what you're getting, this is a tremendous value. If you're a person who needs to stage a home or who updates the color scheme to your home frequently, this is perfect. It does not seem like this would be a rug that would stand up to many years of use, but again, at the price point, that feels acceptable. I believe you get a lot of wow factor for the price if you are simply looking to decorate a room. If you need the thickness of a traditional rug, buy rug padding to put underneath it.",

Also it does not roll up on the corners, it stays nice & flat. The crinkles from shipping go away in a day or two.",
