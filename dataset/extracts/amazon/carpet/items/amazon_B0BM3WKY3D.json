The only thing that I didn\u2019t like and wasn\u2019t expecting was the size and length, it\u2019s not as wide as I thought it\u2019ll be, the size is the size of an average table, like a rug you\u2019ll put under your table. I thought it\u2019ll fit under my entire bed but it doesn\u2019t but it\u2019s still nice quality. Id recommend.",

Dust in my house isn\u2019t even dust, it\u2019s the fallout from this god awful rug. I could spend hours vacuuming it a week and still get absolutely no where, but somehow the rug hasn\u2019t seemed to thin itself out yet. I\u2019m not sure how much rugs like this are supposed to shed, but this seems supernatural. It\u2019s going to be years down the road after throwing this rug in the trash and I\u2019m still going to find fibers from this thing tucked in a crevice of my house. My roomba vacuumed one straight line on this thing and immediately ran back home because it was full. It came back to give it another try and the same thing happened, only this time it looked like my roomba went to war and lost. I had to wipe down the poor thing because of the fibers that managed to attach to it.",
