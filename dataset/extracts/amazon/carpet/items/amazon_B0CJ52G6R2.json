I will run an iron over mine this evening to see if it reduces the creases.The product says it\u2019s chenille but to me it seems like printed canvas. It doesn\u2019t feel bad on our feet but it\u2019s not soft or plush. It\u2019s a good basic rug to define a space at a great low price. I am happy with my purchase.",

The coloring is very pretty but quickly fades with the dirt traffic. I will not purchase again but I do think it is a pretty cover, possibly use it more as a table top covering. In that kind of setting it would be wonderful for. Thank you, just being honest...again I do think it is pretty.",
