Place the front legs of your sofa on top of the rug or have all four legs rest on the rug To have furniture framed in the center of a large room, we recommend a 9\u2019 x 12\u2019 or larger rug. An equal amount of floor space (between 12\u201d - 18\u201d) should be left on all sides if possible",

It\u2019s so soft but not very thick so you might need a rug pad underneath if that bothers you. It\u2019s also not non-stick at all but I use carpet tape on all my rugs. Can\u2019t beat the price, rugs are so expensive when you have to buy a new one every so often because of dogs! I like having a plush rug in our space to offset the coldness of our hardwood floors and this does just the job. Love that it\u2019s offered in 8x8 because that\u2019s perfect for my small living room.",
