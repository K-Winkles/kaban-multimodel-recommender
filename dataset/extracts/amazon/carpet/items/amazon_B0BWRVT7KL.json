I ordered two of these the first one I opened and did not follow the instructions. followed the directions for the second one and opened the package let it plump up then took it out of package laid it flat for 24 hours and the wrinkles were gone and it looks nice under my dining room table. It is very soft and the color is lovely. The rug is very soft and just enough padding. It is not super thick but in my opinion perfect.The other one I will be using in my living area that I did not follow directions when opening does have an area with a bunch of wrinkles but I have laid it out and for 3 days now before putting in living area and they are disappearingThere was not a smell like some were writing about it was ever so faint and was gone within an hour. I am very happy I purchased and my advice is follow the directions when opening.For the price these are great and I would buy more if I have the need loved they arrived next day too.",

                "reviewText": "This is an average, decent rug at an above average retail price. We purchased it with the current $13 off coupon and, with that discount, it brought the price down to what this quality of carpet should be offered for every day.When you hear the term \"shag,\" most folks envision a thick carpet with flowing fibers. That is not the case here. This is absolutely a low pile, thin carpet with very little padding. Indeed, when you get down to the last page of the description, you learn that the entire 5'x7' carpet is less than 0.3 inches thick and weighs slightly less than 5 pounds. The backing is not truly \"non-slip,\" though it is advertised as such. The \"non-stick\" feature is actually a series of tiny bumps of a sort of rubberized substance. We tested the non-stick claim by placing the rug on a Travertine tile entryway and the rug could still slide in each directly while being walked on by a grown adult. Better than having nothing on the bottom, but still a long way from being fully non-slip.To be sure, it comes shrink-wrapped. You need to lay it out fully and flat and give it a day or two to have it return to original size and get rid of the folds. Our rug did not feature any smell that some other reviewers have mentioned.All in all, an ordinary and average quality area rug that should handle minimal traffic. Nothing fancy, just a functional rug at a decent price point (with the discount coupon).",

                "reviewText": "I needed a cheap replacement rug so my expectations weren't high for the price range but I was very unhappy when I first opened it from its tiny shrinkwrapped brick. It felt like a cheap bathmat that I was going to be returning. On a whim I threw it in the dryer on a low setting with a damp towel hoping to get the wrinkles/creases out and it dramatically improved in only about 10-15. It went from looking nothing like the pictures to very nice looking and feeling. I know it's supposed to air out but the dryer trick instantly turned it into a keeper. I would have left a negative review like some others if I relied on the first impression and sent it back. I doubt it would be durable enough for repeated shoe traffic but it feels great on bare feet in the bedroom.",
