Due to different monitor resolutions and lighting you may notice a slight difference. My rug has a chemical odor. Is this normal ? Dyes, yarns, backing and packing material all have natural odors that are sometimes magnified after being sealed for shipping and storage. If desired, place the rug near an open window or fan for the first few hours to help air it out. How do I get rid of folded edges or creases in my rug ? Open your rug as soon as possible once it arrives. Then place the rug on the floor and pull gently on the edges to help smooth out any creases. Creases should disappear within a few days.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this rug to replace an old shaggy rug that was under my gaming set up. This rug was PERFECT. I needed something pink, something soft but not super shaggy, just plush enough for my chair to still roll on. My gaming chair has no problem rolling on it, it vacuums very easily and it wasn\u2019t at all wrinkled. Once I unfolded it it flattened out almost instantly. It\u2019s really soft to the touch and I\u2019m honestly impressed by the quality at the price point. I thought it would be more of a blanket thin rug but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s literally perfect and really pretty. The color was spot on but my picture is in low lighting so it might looks dull in the pic. But the rug itself was spot on and great for the price. I kind of want to buy other colors now \u2026",

There are grippy dots on the back to keep it from sliding. We\u2019ve washed it a few times and it\u2019s held up great with no shedding. We wash and dry on the bulky/comforter setting in cold water & low heat. Easy to spot clean with a rag too. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This rug is exactly what I was looking for. A small area rug with a bit of padding, but NOT one of those ridiculous 3 inch faux fur rugs. I bought it for my bedroom to put beside the bed. Just the right size for my space. Very soft, and it looks really nice in person.I've only had it a few weeks so I can't speak to the durability, but it was only $20. I would probably buy another if it lasts for a reasonably decent period of time.The white sections especially show dirt really easily, but it's so small it's no problem to quickly run the vacuum over it, and thus far, that leaves it looking good as new again (and my vacuum is a very basic model without a brush, just for reference).Just one caveat: when I first took it out of the package, it had a VERY strong chemical smell. At first I was just going to leave it on the floor to air out while I ran some errands, but after a couple of minutes, I realized the smell was strong enough it was noticeable from the hallway. Yikes.Fortunately, I happened to receive it at the start of a sunny weekend, so I hung it over our deck railing and let it air out for two days. This did the trick. I probably would have been fine bringing it in after only one day, but since the weather was so nice, I left it longer just in case. I was very relieved that this worked, because as I said, it's exactly what I was looking for, and I haven't seen many similar to this design.However, I don't have kids. Due to how strong the smell was, I would hesitate before allowing babies or small children to play on it, as is shown in the pictures.",

                "reviewText": "This rug is great. Please ignore clutter in my pic, I\u2019m redoing our play area/living room/office. We had an old piece of carpet serving as a rug but it was getting gross so I went looking for something soft but with cushion. Also MUST be able to vacuum because my toddler and his buds are messy! The first rug I ordered was smaller than advertised and would suck up in the vacuum and was so thin. I packed it back up and tried this one. When I first opened it and unrolled it, I loved how soft it was but thought maybe it would be too small as well. It starts off a few inches too short in all directions. But I grabbed my vacuum and started sweeping out to all the sides and it does stretch out to the correct dimensions with some patience! Note I do turn the suction lower on my vacuum because it still is thinner than carpet, but it\u2019s a good material and soft! I have some waterproof carpet pad underneath and it\u2019s perfect. Definitely recommend this rug for toddler play areas! Bonus that it is machine washable as well :)",
