            "Non-Slip and Durable: Low-pile synthetic carpet fibers are durable enough for high-traffic spaces. When walking on the carpet, the low pile design is less slippery than the long pile, while the bottom surface has many non-slip points that increase the friction between the carpet and the floor, making the carpet somewhat slip-resistant.",
            "Suitable Scenario: Our fuzzy fashion-inspired rug is for perfect home decor for living room, bedroom, home office, kid's room, girl's room, boy's room, playroom, nursery, or college dorm. Due to furry carpet comes vacuum sealed and laminated very tightly, it might be thin at first and normal to see some creases. But don't worry, please lay it flat, the high pile rug will recover fluffiness in 1 to 2 days.",
            "Soft and Comfortable: This living room rug is not only lovely in appearance, but also very soft. The surface layer is fluffy low-pile material, and the sandwich layer is a fast-rebound memory foam, which is more friendly to the skin and more comfortable to walk, sit and lie on the rug. The fabric of the carpet is very suitable for family use, ideal for indoor use in the living room, bedroom, children's room, etc.",
            "Easy to Clean: Regular vacuuming is recommended, Compared to long lint, the low lint structure is more friendly to family members and does not accumulate too much dirt. If you want to do deeper clean, you can wash the area rugs by hands, Then choose a site that's well ventilated, allow it to be fully air dried before next use."

The rug is wadded up in a vacuum sealed ball comes out looking like nothing I'd seen before. However after you open it up and let it set it for the day it goes back to normal and looks like new- no wrinkles or anything.It is an interesting concept and gives the impression of one of those dish drying mats- only a giant one. But the top is super soft, like a plush throw blanket, and doesn't feel like a rug. At first I thought of dropping the rating because of the price, as I thought \"how is this any different than just tossing a throw blanket on the floor\" for the kids?1. It is thicker than a throw and gives more cushion2. It holds its shape and stays flat and in place unlike any throw3. I was shocked to find that I was able to vacuum it easily and the Dyson did not suck it up or drag it around (the suction is so strong we can't do that with our smaller rugs and bath mats).In summary I went from initially disgusted to pleasantly surprised overall.",

                "reviewText": "This rug is incredibly soft. It feels so good on your feet, and my kids just want to roll around on it because it's so soft. I like that the pile isn't crazy long, and the binding seems to be well made.The rug came tightly packaged in a vacuum seal bag, so I was concerned about getting all the wrinkles out. The instructions say vacuuming it can help, but you may need to wash and dry it to get the creases out. I ordered the largest size, and even though it is washable, I didn't want to put such a heavy load in our home machine. Fortunately, a few times going over it with the vacuum cleaner was all it needed to lie flat and look great.I ordered the green color, but it really looks a lot more blue - like a deep ocean/naval bluegreen. It's a really beautiful color. It's really amazing how much it warmed up the look and feel of our living room. Highly recommend.",

I think this would be great in a kids room or somewhere that you\u2019d be on the floor because it pretty nice to touch. The color is okay. It\u2019s listed as a gray green but it\u2019s just green to me. At first touch this rug reminded me of a big bath towel. There\u2019s no looping but the feeling and look of this rug feels like a bath towel. As to its strength to hold up to life and vacuuming and washing? We will have to see.",

It's a 6x9 feet slice of heaven in grey and green that turns your floor into the trendiest spot in the house. This rug isn't just soft; it's like stepping on a cloud that decided to take a vacation in your living room. The chic color wash makes it a perfect fit for any decor - it's like the rug equivalent of that one friend who gets along with everyone at the party. It's washable, which is great for those who, like me, occasionally enjoy dinner on the floor (don't judge).One pro tip: when you first get it, give it some air. Trust me, airing it out is like letting a fine wine breathe; it just gets better. So, unroll, air out, and let your feet indulge in this cozy, stylish treat!",

                "reviewText": "Found this very odd? I expected a long roll to show up, you know like picking up a rug from a local shop. Nope, it shows up in a small 14'' x 14\" x 6\" ish sized vacuum sealed bag. I am very sensitive to smells and this smell really hurt me. This smell upon opening the rug was so intense I started having a headache, throat and tummy ache. Uggh. While all these other things are cool I am unable to give a complete review based on having to grab trash bags and double bagging this. One upside down inside the other and tied off tightly. While looking at it the material, construction, anti-slip, fabric and such all seemed great. That smell took over my apartment for at least a half of a day. I opened windows at both ends and still took forever to go away. Very sad because I wanted to place this on the same day as it arrived. I still do not even understand how to describe this smell. If it had a hint of punk or poo I would have lost it. It was extremely putrid. Oh, even worse yet. The smell stayed on me and my clothes. Eeww.Okay. My examination was extremely rushed as I was trying to stuff this in garbage bags to block the smell. Trying to hit all those points. Fabric, construction, backing material, non-skid. This rushed exam left me thinking about quality. Just wanted to clarify that I did not have enough time to really look this over.Would I order again?No. I do not think that I could go through this again.I am happy that others have not complained about this and hopeful this is just a one time thing.Would I offer this as a gift?Absolutely, not.Overall, this is probably a great rug. However, with this bad of a smell it just will not be able to function as a rug is intended to function. Looking nice with great material and construction is fine but a rug should be able to be placed in the home. This one will not be used by me in my apartment or even outside. It will be a gift to someone that has a washer big enough to wash it and maybe, just maybe that smell will fallout enough for them to enjoy it. My housekeeper offered to wash it for me and now I am thinking of just letting her keep it.",

I've never seen anything like it, and my kids are in love with it. I am not sure how long it will take to fully flatten and smooth out since it comes vacuum-packed, but I think it would be great in a bedroom, playroom, or other space where you might want to be on the floor. Because it's so soft I don't know if it would be good in a higher traffic area.",
