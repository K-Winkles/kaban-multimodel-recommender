                "reviewText": "I purchased this rug for my dog. I have a 14 yr old small dog who is very slippy on the hard floors. Not only is she a senior girl, she also has intervertebral disc disease, and she has had two flare ups in the past three years from slipping on the floor. I have a lot of bath rugs all over the place for her, but I needed something in the 10 ft, to 12 ft range for the hallway outside of my bedroom as the previous rug was not washable and needed to go. Unfortunately, this rug is only 6 ft long, but it was very affordable. The color is a beautiful, majestic purple. The material is just like the low-pile microfiber bath rugs that I have from Costco, which is exactly what I wanted, as that material is easy to vacuum. It looks great in my hallway, and the solid color goes well with the two different area rugs that I have in the adjacent rooms. As I just got the rug, there's no telling how it stands up to being washed, but if it's half as good as the bath rugs from Costco, then it will be a win.Edited to add: I have not tried to set the rug on fire, but I imagine if I tried, it may light up like a backyard deep-fried frozen turkey in hot oil. Instead, I set it on the floor and walk on it. It's very soft. Softer than all of my other rugs.",
