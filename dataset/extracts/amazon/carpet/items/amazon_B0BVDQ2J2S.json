Then use a damp cloth or a low-powered vacuum cleaner for a simple clean.For deep cleaning: Add proper amount of mild detergent, soak and wash with your hands. Then put the carpet in a cool, ventilated place to air dry.In addition, the carpet can be easily rolled up by hand and placed in the corner.Rapid Resilience- No Fear of VacuumThe vacuum compression packing of the carpet to keep it clean makes it appear thin at first. But due to its good resilience, the carpet will gradually return to its fluffy shape after lying flat on the ground for 2-3 days.\uff08The rug may give off some smell when opening the package, which is a normal phenomenon caused by warehouse storage. Please leave it in a ventilated place for 1-2 days, and the odor will dissipate.\uff09Any other questions, please feel free to contact us.",

I wanted this to fit under my queen size bed and by the size of a 6x9 it should absolutely fit with extra. Yea it doesn\u2019t do that. I like the rug for what it is of course. But not super happy with it. I will need to order another one to fill in the space it doesn\u2019t cover. Just be aware it\u2019s super thin. My son has one in his bedroom a big black fluffy one and it\u2019s way better quality then this one but it was a gift and I dont know the brand. Otherwise I would have ordered that one.",

This one, however, is disgustingly cheap and low quality quality. It will not fluff out, it slides everywhere, and it\u2019s thinner than a dollar store bath mat. This is no joke. I couldn\u2019t tell you the last time I left a product review. But this was so bad I couldn\u2019t NOT. So here I am. Buyer beware. Will be returning. Dont waste your time or money. Though the color is spot on for the picture, (I ordered the dark green) everything else is terrible. Nothing else good to say.",
