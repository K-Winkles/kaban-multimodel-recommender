I love that it comes folded up in a vacuum bag so it isn\u2019t some big bulky thing to get delivered and it is very soft and looks nice. The only thing I don\u2019t love is that it is difficult to vacuum so if your dog eats a biscuit and drops some pieces it\u2019s difficult to get them out sometimes. But it lays flat, doesn\u2019t slip, and doesn\u2019t seem to stain very easy. So overall it\u2019s a good purchase.",
