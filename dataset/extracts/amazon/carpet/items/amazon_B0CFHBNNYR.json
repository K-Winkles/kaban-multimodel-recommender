It arrived folded and air sealed so I laid it out with the front down when it arrived and ironed out all the lines and wrinkles. I then flipped it over and applied two layers of Scotch Gaurd for rugs/carpet. I used rug tape to get it to stay exactly where I wanted it.I have been able to vacuum it. The rug tape and furniture holds it down so it doesn\u2019t pull up into the vacuum too much. One of our cats threw up on it the day after I put it out, but the Scotch Guard did its job and it wiped right off with soap and water.It has kind of a blue-ish hue to it so I\u2019m not completely sold on the color. It also looks really cheap close up. You can see white underneath. It is very soft and it will work for now.",

I spread it out for 3 days and then used \u201cAlien Tape\u201d on all the corners to stretch it out. After corners were secured I used more \u201cAlien Tape\u201d on the center of all 4 sides and stretched a bit more. Looks pretty good now. It\u2019s very soft. But much thinner than it looks in pictures. Almost zero padding. But again pretty good for the price.",
