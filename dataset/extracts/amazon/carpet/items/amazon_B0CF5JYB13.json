I would call it a huge bath mat, but it's not even that nice.It looks kind of like a sweatshirt printed on a no-slip backing. Idk how else to describe it.It's seriously awful.I only bought it to save my house from the mud my dog will inevitably track in through my mudroom this Fall, so whatever, I'll use it.If you are looking for something that even resembles a rug with any kind of pile, this is not it. It's honestly one of the cheapest looking things I've purchased from Amazon, and I feel like that's saying something. It's like rug from Wish that even they refused to sell full price.",
