Reverse roll the rug, let it sit for a day or two; 2. Flatten the rug by applying weight. Is the size of the rug accurate? Because of the folded and compressed packaging, the size of rug may be smaller than described when you first open it, but the rug becomes fluffy and thicker, and the size will also become bigger. Is the rug non-slip? Our carpets can prevent carpet sliding to a certain extent, but the anti-slip effect varies depending on the flooring material. Wooden flooring is less anti-slip and tile flooring is the best.",

                "reviewText": "I got the grey and white rug. It was shrink wrapped and when I released it from the bag and put it on the floor, I wasn't sure all of the wrinkles and lines would ever come out. It was also a few inches shorter than advertised. But after 24 hours of being on the floor, it smoothed out and got longer. I love it! It is very soft. I wouldn't say its shag, not the traditional shag from the 80's but that doesn't take away from it. My dog of course had to claim it and she piddled a tiny bit on it. I just used some enzyme spray and it cleaned up nicely. It says it can be machine washed, but I will most likely not do that because of it's size. I'll spot clean and/or use my deep cleaning vacuum.This rug would be best in a bedroom due to how soft it is. I wouldn't put it in a high traffic area because I feel its meant for bare feet and would be a great rug for children to play on. For the price of under $45, it can't be beat.",

When I laid it out on the floor, it had all kinds of creases and bubbles sticking up. But, after a few days, it all laid out very nicely, and looks beautiful. For the money, this is a great rug. If you are a person who likes to sit on the floor, this rug isn\u2019t very thick, so you might want to buy a pad or something to put underneath it. Other than that it works great.",
