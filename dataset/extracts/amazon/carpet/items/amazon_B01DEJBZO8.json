Have vacuumed a several times since laying down, does vacuum nicely. Would give it 5 stars if it was skid resistant and have a rubber backing. Had to place a piece of rubber rug floor skid guard underneath. Good value & nicely made.",

It fits perfectly where I put it.Just be aware that if you put it on a hard floor surface, you will need to get some non-skid backing. We are slipping on it and our dog runs over it and slides it across the floor.Per cleaning and vacuuming? I have not had it long enough to run the vacuum over it yet but it seems heavy enough and I do not think the vacuum will pull it up at the corners.I would recommend this item with the condition you are aware of the safety factor needed.",

It came rolled up, so I had to weight the ends down for a day or two to flatten it out, which it did perfectly. There's no non-slip backing, but it doesn't slide around like some of the cheaper rugs out there. It's very soft and feels good on bare feet. Excellent quality for the price! Order with confidence.",
