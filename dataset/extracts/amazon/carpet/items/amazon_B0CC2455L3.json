Luckily we were able to position it in a way where you won\u2019t really notice it however, for the $80 price tag being 2 inches short overall is ridiculous.",

                "reviewText": "This rug is floppy and flimsy. The no-stick bottom isn\u2019t sticky and it will shift around a lot as you walk on it. I\u2019ve had it for 2 months and there\u2019s still a wrinkle in the middle. I added a piece of no-stick mesh from that Swedish company; the rug and mat still shift, even when I sweep away all the dirt and dust from under it. I\u2019m tired of looking and it\u2019s a perfect colour, so I\u2019m keeping it and I will try a thicker, stickier mesh.",
