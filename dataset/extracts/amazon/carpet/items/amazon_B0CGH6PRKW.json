                "reviewText": "This rug is possibly the softest rug I've ever seen. It is shaggy, but not so much that it doesn't clean well with a vacuum. It has a rubbery back on it that helps it to not slide on my vinyl plank flooring and it also has sticky pieces to help stick it to the floor if you want to use them. I chose not to and it's really fine without it. It is cushy and comfortable. The color is deep and rich and constant throughout. It is thick and no spots that look bald or thin. I have paid way more for an 8x10 that wasn't as nice as this so I think the price is great. I recommend without reservation. You will love it!",

                "reviewText": "I have a strange addiction to buying rugs. I own more rugs than any one person should ever own. I switch out all of the rugs in my house for the holidays to change the color to match my decorations. So please do not take it lightly when I say that this is the best rug I have ever owned. It is beautiful, soft, plush, and most importantly as I got the white one\u2026 easy to clean. I have a 6 month old baby and he has spit up all colors of food on this thing and with some stain remover spray and paper towels I have had no issues getting it back to perfect condition quickly.This rug is amazing and every single person who has come into my house since I put it down has commented on how nice it is and how they want one.This was intended as a holiday rug and I was going to roll it up and switch back to my normal rug. That will not be happening. This rug stays. It\u2019s highly possible that I find this same rug in other colors and slowly replace out all of my previous favorite rugs.Do not pass this up. Get this rug.If this review hasn\u2019t convinced you enough, just look at how happy my son is laying on it. I also look that happy laying on it. You will also be that happy.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a large rug to cover an open area of carpet in the master bedroom. After spending a few days steam cleaning stains and never wanting to do that again, I thought a rug would be the best solution.This rug is perfect. It's large, very soft, as a non slip underside and easy to machine wash. It came with a package of tape to keep the rug from moving more than it does. The material looks natural but has a light synthetic feel to it. It's feels so soft for being so thin. It can get slippery if you're walking on this and wearing socks. This is well made. The stitching around the edges is solid. Hardly any fraying. This rug is much more suited to resting on top of carpet. Not sure how well it would do over wood floors. Overall great product. Great value for the price listed.",
