The bathroom rug made of faux wool and anti-skid point plastic backing (small size) or TPE backing (large size), which is soft to touch and non slip. If you want to enhance the grip, it is recommended to use with an extra rug pad. How to clean the living room area rug? Offering endless convenience for every lifestyle, it's safe in the washing machine. Also for daily cleaning with broom, or wipe. Tips: Wash in cold water with mild detergent; Do not use chlorine or bleach; Tumble dry on low heat or lay to air dry. Why is there a color difference? 1. Different batches may have different colors, which is normal; 2. Due to the light and screen display, the color of the floor mat may have some chromatic aberration in different environments.",

So far, spills have pooled on the pile of the rug instead of seeping in, but I don\u2019t know if this will continue. The rug comes folded up for shipping but the creases relax if you place something heavy on top of them. I\u2019m so glad that washable rugs have now come down so much in price. I don\u2019t trust my senior chihuahua so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be replacing this one but that was the idea - to have something pretty that\u2019s washable and when it\u2019s too gone thanks to the pup, to replace it.

The rug fibers are made of what is called \"faux wool\" but whatever it really is, it is SLIPPERY. It won't provide the friction your feet will be expecting when you walk across it barefoot.And the rug is VERY thin. (A tip-off is that it ships folded up in a box, rather than being rolled up like all the other rugs from Amazon I've purchased). This could be a showstopper for you as it turns out it is difficult to vacuum because it is so thin. When I went to vacuum it before packing it up for return, I found that the rug is so thin that it sucked up onto the bottom of my vacuum rather than laying flat. (and my vacuum was set at the highest carpet level) Pulling the vacuum over the rug caused the rug to stick to the vacuum at times and pull the rug along with it and put big folds and wrinkles in the rug. Easy enough to stretch back out to cover the floor and the wrinkles and folds are gone, but it is surprising that my vacuum can pull the run around.Otherwise, it looks pretty nice when laid out. One issue is that the colors were not quite as I expected. The \"creme\" colored parts of the rug pattern were a lot lighter in the actual rug than what the sales photos led me to expect. That was a disappointment, although not a showstopper for me.",
