It's in my laundry room which gets a ton of traffic, and everyone comments on how soft it feels to walk on. The color comes across as light cream and blue. Very pretty and worth the money. We've only had it a few weeks, but so far so good.",

The material is soft, and super easy to wipe things up. Full rubber backing for non-slip. THE EDGES DON'T ROLL. It comes folded in the small box, rather than rolled and wrapped, preventing the edges to roll. There are crease lines in the carpet from being folded, however they are laying flatter and flatter as the day goes one. Will be interested to see how this holds up after our first trip to the laundromat for machine washing. We got this specifically for that reason as we have 4 pets in the house and kids to come soon.",

                "reviewText": "It was a nice rug, although quite thin. I\u2019m sure this is what makes it washable. It feels like a soft velvet rather than carpet fiber which I was ok with. I returned it because the color and pattern seemed to be printed on the top of the rug and did not extend through the fiber. This and the pixelated look of the rug wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted for my room. It looks okay from a distance. With the limited ink used to print the pattern on the rug, I doubted its ability to withstand multiple washings if needed. With pets, I wanted something a little sturdier and better constructed. There isn\u2019t much to it.",
