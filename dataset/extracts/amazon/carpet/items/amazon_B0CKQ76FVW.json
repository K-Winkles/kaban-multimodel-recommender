                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Pretty machine-made geometric pattern 3'x5' rug, low profile at 0.28\" high. Matches kitchen mats.",
                "reviewText": "When I ordered this pretty 3'x5' rug, I thought the pattern was familiar but couldn't quite place it. All became clear to me when I went to get something to drink just now and alertly noted that this rug is an exact match to my kitchen mats because they're made by the same company. At least now I know where I'd seen this pattern before in rugs.This is a pretty geometric design, and the rug is soft but is extremely thin at 0.28\". I don't want to put this between the dining room and kitchen for my dog to lie on and look out the front windows while he watches me cook because it's so thin.If it fits my spot okay, I may put this in the kitchen in front of the sink and continue to use my two kitchen mats that are just like this one. Before I do that, though, I want to put this on the faux hardwood floor just inside the front door and see if the door will open with this rug in front of it, since it doesn't like to do that, evidently. The care instructions in the listing information are: \"Machine Wash, Hand Wash Only.\" I'll machine wash it and hopefully can wait till a nice, sunny day.The kitchen mats are made of high quality PVC material with a nonslip backing and are 0.47\" thick. They're the softest, most well padded kitchen mats I've ever had - our last set passed away in a dog-related incident - but we have faux hardwood floors, and even though the mats have a good backing, the smaller mat slides around a bit. I don't blame the mat but blame the floors instead.This area rug is made of faux wool with a geometric design, and I love it, but it's too thin to be an area rug for me or my dog. We're both dealing with a little arthritis, and he's not spoiled or anything but my dog likes a very thick rug.I love the pattern and colors of this rug - mine is black and white, like my kitchen mats - and have had kitchen mats exactly like this rug, from the same seller, since late November of last year. They're excellent, very well padded mats, but this rug is 0.28\" thick and, as far as I'm concerned, is too thin to be a comfortable area rug. It IS, though, perfect to put in front of our front door, inside, since the door refused to close on the last doormat I had in there.This is a pretty, well made area rug which comes in a wide variety of sizes and has matching kitchen mats. It has a non-slip backing but is very thin at 0.28\". If it can fit under our front door, it will be a perfect doormat, which would be great in these snowy times, and if it can't it can go in the kitchen with the matching mats.I like this rug and recommend it if you're looking for a very thin area rug with a nonslip backing and a geometric pattern or if you want to order this and order matching kitchen mats separately. It will work fine in our kitchen with the matching mats, but I hope it decides to live in front of the door and fits just right.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a long but not too wide rug and this is just about perfect. The fold lines are a little distracting but they should ease out eventually and they don't bother me that much.The size is great, and it's very soft. Softer than I was expecting to be honest. It also has a good solid dense feel to it so it should last a good long while which is great since I don't want to constantly be having to get and replace rugs. Everything they advertised seems to be true so if you like the design, and need a good sturdy soft 3x6 rug I'd recommend this as a great option. (just be warned you might have to fight a bit with the creases at first since it's shipped folded up in a square - not rolled. This doesn't bother me at all but if it would bother you it's very good to know in advance)",

                "reviewText": "This mat is much softer than I was expecting, and the color is lovely. It's a perfect fit for the patio doors, to keep the floor a little bit cleaner as humans and dogs wander in from the muddy yard. Because it's relatively lightweight -and- washable, it's perfect for its location.My only (minor) gripe is that it's delivered folded, not rolled, so there were some big creases in the fabric when it was delivered. Even after a couple of weeks being rolled up before installation, there's still a visible crease. I'm hoping that will disappear with more foot traffic and/or when it's washed.",

                "reviewText": "This is a much cushier runner than typical floor mats in the same price range. I might even call it a rug and not a floor mat! The design is printed on, as opposed to woven, so we'll have to see how that works for longevity. The design is fresh, bright, and cheerful.I had originally got the rug for our basement bathroom. I like to do a couple planks or stretches before taking my shower in the morning and was getting tired of using a smaller rug which gave me either cold feet and warm hands or cold hands and warm feet (the basement is cold!) This allows me to stretch out, keeping hands and feet warm at the same time.Really the only thing that bothers me is the width. I would have been much happier if it were a few inches wider. It looks kind of strip-like. The horizontal stripe design makes it look a little wider until you actually stand on it and realize it's just at 24\" wide. The width might work well for other folks.",

                "reviewText": "I recently added the Sungea Geometric Kitchen Runner Rug to my master bedroom, and it has been a delightful addition. While it might not fit the conventional definition of a rug, it is exceptionally soft and feels luxurious underfoot. The softness and warmth make it a pleasure to walk on, creating a cozy atmosphere in my bedroom.As for durability, I haven't had the chance to wash it yet, so I can't speak to that aspect. However, for use in the bedroom, bath, or laundry room, it serves its purpose exceptionally well. The length is just right, adding a touch of style without overpowering the space. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for these areas, but I personally wouldn't use it in the main living area of my home.One standout feature is its reasonable price, considering the quality and comfort it provides. The Sungea Geometric Kitchen Runner Rug offers excellent value for its cost. Overall, I'm thoroughly satisfied with this rug, and I confidently give it 5 stars for its softness, warmth, reasonable price, and suitability for specific areas of the home.",
