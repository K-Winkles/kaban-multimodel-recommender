                "reviewText": "I loved this rug, but it didn\u2019t last long in my household. This rug was incredibly soft and the squish factor was ok. I have 2 dogs and it did not hold up well with pets. As many dog and cats owners know, when they vomit it always has to be done on the rug or carpet, and this rug was no exception. Unfortunately, the rug stained very easily and was very difficult to clean by hand. I ended up having to try and wash it but it did not fit well in my apartment washer but I tried anyways. The vomit stained the rug and it was not coming out. It wasn\u2019t too noticeable so I decided to just live with it. When it came time to vacuum I was worried it might ruin the rug, but having dogs it needed to be done. The vacuum had no issues getting what was on top, but any debris that was closer to the base of the rug was difficult to get out. Fast-forward another month and one of the dogs has an accident on the rug. I wash it and this time the stain isn\u2019t coming out. I tried using my portable carpet cleaner and it made the stain worse. I decided to cut my loss and toss the rug. This would be a great rug for a low traffic area without pets/kids and if you have access to a larger than normal washer",

                "reviewText": "So.. It's not expensive and it's a rug. It's functional. It covers the floor and is soft to the touch.It's also incredibly cheap looking. I equate it to a ragged rat. It's not super thick and doesn't look great to me.There are others that really love the way it looks, so it must be a preference thing. For the money, it's a great value if this is your style. Rugs are outrageously expensive and often do not look good in my opinion. This is a good way to get a large carpet for a reasonable price.I will use it in my rental property, but it's not because I like the way it looks. It's just functional and I don't have to worry about them destroying it.",
