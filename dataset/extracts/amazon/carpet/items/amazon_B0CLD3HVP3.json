It feels incredible under foot, very plush/ thickly padded. It also seems constructed well enough to last for several years. The only minus was the smell. It comes vacuum sealed and has a heavy \"manufacture\" smell once you open it. I let it air outside overnight and that took care of it. Now it's almost perfect. Great product for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this purchase. I was quite skeptical at first when the 4x6 rug arrived in a vacuum sealed square package about the size of a seat cushion. Upon opening it up there was an extremely strong chemical smell, so much so that the smell filled the room. I hung the rug outside overnight to air out and the smell completely disappeared. The rug fluffed up nicely and is soft and thick - overall a great value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "When I saw the package I wondered how the rug fit inside the box, but it's vacuumed sealed, and wrapped in plastic into a tiny little square. I was surprised with how small they managed to make it. After unwrapping it the rug immediately started to expand and fluff out to its intended shape and height. I don't feel comfortable vacuuming this rug because it's very light and I'm not sure how well it'll hold up to a vacuum's suction power, but it is machine washable. Mine arrived with a very heavy chemical smell. I washed mine 24 hours after opening to allow it time to fully expand before washing it. I saw no damage to my machine or the rug. The purple color is still a very vibrant almost royal purple. It's very soft and dried pretty quickly after washing. I did allow about 24 hours before I considered placing it down for use to ensure it was fully dried even though it felt dry to tough about 8 hours after washing.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really soft and deep plush rug, I wasn't expecting the nap to be so thick. I put it right beside my bed, so it's the first thing my feet feel when I get out of bed. My dogs love it too. I've mostly had floral patterned rugs lately, so the brown with geometric design is a nice change of pace. It's heavy enough that it wasn't too hard to vacuum, as long as I stood on the corners to weight them down so they wouldn't get sucked up. I haven't had problems with the rug sliding around or bunching up, but in a more high-traffic area that might be an issue.",
