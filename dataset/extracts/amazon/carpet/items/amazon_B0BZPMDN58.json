                "reviewText": "For the price, the rug is good. It is a vibrant beautiful color. I bought it for the bathroom. But the material is slippery to walk on with socks on or even bare feet. The color looks like it was painted on the fabric. This rug seems to be a soft, thin, synthetic blanket that someone put a non slip backing on it. It did not have a strong plastic odor. Despite being folded into a square and being vacuum sealed, it did not have any wrinkles. I have purchased rugs like this from Amazon before and had major problems laundering it. The mistake I made seems to be putting it in the dryer. When put in the dryer, the nonslip backing and the top part of the rug separate and the rug becomes a lumpy mess. I will not be doing that with this rug.",
