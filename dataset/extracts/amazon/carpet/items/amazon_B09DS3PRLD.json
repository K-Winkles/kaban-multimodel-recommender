But it opens up to a a good size. Great price for the product. Washing instructions on the tag say to wash with cold water and don\u2019t dry. Which is great because this rug is in a kids room and I know it will be dirty soon with the light color my daughter chose.",

                "reviewText": "Serves it purpose. Easy to cut. The material is soft but when placed on floor it's hard. Does tend to leave shaggy remnants on floor. It also depends on the color you buy. Black will last longer because the dirt is disguised. You can still sweep the rug. Light colors tend to get dirty quick. When washed the rug doesn't dry back to its original fluffiness. It looks more like a wet cat.Would not recommend light colored rugs. Cleaning in small spots is easy if it is not very stained. Make sure when spot cleaning it's entirely dried otherwise rug will get mildew. Entire rug can turn into a mess.Don't even bother to buy unless you want it for show and not to walk on.
