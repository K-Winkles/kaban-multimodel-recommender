LOVE IT read directions and let this rug get to room temperature. So soft to sit and walk on. Will be ordering more and beautiful design and outstanding color love the backing. At this time no pad under it just the rug and its padding. My new floors hopefully in by Jan. But so far the rug is the winner. Have had several compliments. My 35 year old daughter sat and wrapped presents for Christmas and she was amazed at the comfort and quality. It is a spare room with chocolate brown in color for decor.( twin bed, cover, curtains etc) this rug color really pulled the room together. Love this rug. Very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this rug because of the low price, but it's great. It does have a no slip backing, so it stays put. The texture is something like a velour, very soft. The print is not perfectly even. There are spots where the design is not well inked, but it lends to an aged look. I love that it doesn't have longer carpet fibers to catch dirt. I did have to iron it extensively when I first opened it, but it smoothed out nicely and is a perfect addition to the living room.",

I'm a dog walker and use carpet to cover the floor of the back of my truck for my pups, plus to save the original carpet underneath. Was disappointed when these were delivered and found out it wasn't carpet of any kind. But I used it anyway, and glad I did. It's better than carpet for my dogs! It's soft, and very durable and doesn't seem to get as dirty as regular carpet. I should mention I also used 1 inch foam gym tiles under these \"rugs\" but only as added protection for the trucks carpeting underneath. I'll be buying more when these ones get worn out, which seems like it will take a long while. Might just buy some and store them in case these are no longer available by then.",
