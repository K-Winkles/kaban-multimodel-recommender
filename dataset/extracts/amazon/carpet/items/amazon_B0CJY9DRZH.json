Step 2: Flip the boho rug Roll the living room rug in the opposite direction from where it was originally placed. This simple action helps flatten your carpet quickly. Step 3: Steam or heat treatment If your rugs for the living room won't straighten naturally, consider using steam or a hair dryer to heat them. This will help encourage the fibers to relax and settle, making the creases disappear more easily.",

                "reviewText": "This area rug is colorful and quite attractive. I really like the design and intricate pattern. I think it would look good on a wall as an art piece. I don't like it as much on the floor, as it's not that comfortable to walk or sit on. This area rug is very thin and has virtually no padding. There is a rubberized backing material to control slipping, but it's also very thin and almost unnoticeable. Because the rug is so thin and lightweight, it doesn't pass my robot vacuum test. The robot is always lifting the corners and edges, requiring some manual re-adjustment after cleaning. I'm sure that a powerful hand vacuum would be difficult to use on this rug near the edges. The rug arrived folded, and after a few weeks it still shows many creases. I'm sure they will eventually go away over time, and after the creases are gone I'll need to use some carpet tape to hold the edges down.Overall, I really like the look of this rug. It's just not very soft and comfortable if you plan to sit or walk on it with bare feet.",

It\u2019s comfortable and stable to walk on.\u201d Right now I have it on a laminate floor that I slide on when walking on it with my socks. I dislike that! Now that I have the rug there I do longer slide, and miracle of miracles, the rug doesn\u2019t slide either. I put it on the floor and then pulled on it to rearrange where it was. It moved, but I had to pull on it. The back doesn\u2019t feel sticky to my hand, but it does lay snugly on the floor.I like old things, and while this rug isn\u2019t old, it looks old (except for the edge bindings \u2013 they\u2019re perfect). I also like how the edges don\u2019t curl up. I have another area rug that when I walk over it I often catch the edge of the rug with my foot and pull it up. I guess I don\u2019t lift my feet much. This rug is thinner than that one, but I\u2019ve still caught it and yet the edge doesn\u2019t curl up, it just flops back down. Nice!I ordered the 5\u2019 by 7\u2019 version, and it\u2019s plenty big. I like the patterns on the rug (it\u2019s the Blue/Beige version). There\u2019s not much more to say, so I\u2019ll stop here!",
