Smaller rugs can also be used to define a smaller seating area for reading or drinking coffee. DECORATING THE BEDROOM For bedrooms, you can either lay the shag carpet under the bed or elsewhere in the room, such as next to the bed, in a smaller sitting area, or in the middle of the room if that space is open. DECORATING THE KIDS ROOM You can refer to the bedroom scheme, but if there is a baby bassinet or play tent inside the kid's room, you can lay the shag rug under or beside them. It is also heartwarming to play with your kids on top of this furry area rug.",

                "reviewText": "I selected this rug for my Special Needs grandson's room since it looked so fluffy and nice. Their pictures made it look plush. Maybe I have a different opinion on plush. The rug fibers are soft, but I found it to be very thin in the shag and too flat. Hardly any padding so it is feels like walking on the floor. The backing is made really well. Once I had it unpackaged, the smell really got to me, had to hang in garage for several days to reduce the odor.According to their cleaning instructions, it can't go in the washing machine and my grandson does having urping issues so I am not sure how I would clean it. Wiping won't do it or vacuuming. They also state keep out of direct sunlight, and his room gets a good amount of sunshine.So, I have decided not to use it in my grandson's room for health reasons. It really isn't working for me and will probably donate later.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised to see how light this rug is. It\u2019s probably the lightest rug I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s super soft! I was also surprised that I haven\u2019t seen any shedding from it. Most faux fur rugs tend to shed quite a bit. I got the white rug. It almost looks like a polar bear is on the floor. The white is super bright, and makes it look luxurious. The fur on the rug isn\u2019t extremely thick, but it isn\u2019t a balding head either. This rug isn\u2019t really big- it\u2019s about 5X3- maybe a bit smaller. So far, it doesn\u2019t seem to dirty easily. I have a few rugs that attract dirt like magnets. This thankfully, isn\u2019t none of them! It seems easy enough to clean, as it\u2019s small enough and light enough to go in the wash. I\u2019d definitely put it in the delicate cycle. If you are using a carpet cleaning machine, I\u2019d be careful that the wet wheels don\u2019t drag more dirt on it while cleaning it. As far as non slip, I\u2019m using it on carpet, and it doesn\u2019t move easily, but I don\u2019t think it has enough grip on the bottom to stay in place if you put it on tile. I haven\u2019t tested that out, but I have had plenty of rugs to say the least. All in all for the price, it\u2019s a decent little rug. Better than many I\u2019ve had like it at the same price or higher.",
