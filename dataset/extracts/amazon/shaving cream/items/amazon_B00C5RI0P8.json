                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this stuff and it works great for me. Now i will state that i use this strictly for my genital region. I have been using it for several years now with very limited problems. Occasionally i get red bumps( kinda like razor burn for a day or 2 afterwords but it clears up with no problems other than a little itchiness) Apparently i do not have sensitive skin because i leave it on longer than recommended time.These are my instructions for doing the genital area ( booty hole, testes/shaft, and bikini area)IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE WORK UP TO WHERE IM AT.1. trim hair to where its about a 1/4 inch or shorter in desired area that you're shaving. (electric clippers work great for this)2. apply a liberal amount of the Magic Shaving Cream to the desired area. I recommend starting with the bikini area, then do testes/shaft, then taint area, then booty-hole and cheeks.3. Immediately start the timer for 8 minutes ( or less if you are working up to it)4. At the 4 minute mark, Re-smear the applied cream around, just to move it around and get different angles on the hair. ( sometimes i'll notice i didnt get an area well and i'll move some from a more heavily applied area to the less applied area.)5. When the timer goes off jump in the shower and take a wash rag and remove the cream immediately. (you'll notice large amount of hair being removed with the cream)6. After your shower dry off and use your towel to help wipe off some of the extra hairs that remained. (you wont get all of them but they will fall off within the day so dont worry about it)7. Admire yourself in the mirror ( you good looking dawg you)NOTES - if you notice that around the booty-hole area is sensitive right after doing this process apply a small amount of Vix vapor rub ( yes im serious) and it'll cool down the area.",

                "reviewText": "Definitely like this cream and no real complaints. I did a test area and didn't have any problems at all. I applied the shave and hair removal cream to my chest and left on 5 minutes and removed in the shower. Hair just feel of easily when I used a wash cloth. This photo is 3 weeks AFTER I used the shaving cream for my Master's men's swimming competition. I never enjoyed shaving my chest so this is definitely quicker and easier, although not as super close as a razor blade shave. Smells minty and didn't bother me at all and I ordered another tube. I only used about 1/4th the tube contents to do my entire chest and abs. I ended up swimming a Little faster and hair still grows back in!!",

                "reviewText": "I always struggled with strawberry legs and razor bumps anytime I shaved, waxing was too expensive plus having to grow it out, and nair never got all the hair and smells PUTRID. This still stinks like burnt hair when it starts working, but the smell doesn\u2019t linger long. Washing after with an unscented soap then paired with an unscented gentle moisturizer after and I swear my skin has never been smoother. I just bought my fourth bottle. For the price too? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go back to other hair removal methods.",

                "reviewText": "I followed the instructions to a \u201cT\u201d. When the proper amount of time was up (4 mins exactly). I only removed a small area to test the effectiveness of the product (as they suggest in the instructions.). After removing that test area i noticed no hair was removed. I then decided to take the liberty to allow the product to stay on my face longer than recommended (around 8 minutes). yet, even after that amount of time. I then fully removed the product to see there was still no hair removal anywhere. This is the second time I have tried their cream based products and they have failed. First time was the blue less intense version. There was no result, hence to why I thought trying the stronger version would work. For more context I did and do not have a beard, I had more of a kin to scruff.For more details the hair was long enough to be easily visible (rough looking) and to cause irritation on my skin, along with being able to easily be shaved. ( shaving just causes more irritation though.)I wanted a refund but unfortunately this seller does not offer that option. I wish I would have paid more attention to that detail before buying.",
