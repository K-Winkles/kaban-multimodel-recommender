                "reviewText": "I figured I would give it a try even though this is not my usual brand because it was quite reasonably priced and I got three bottles for the price I usually spend for one. My house includes five males and two ladies. The young men, for some reason, constantly use the women's shaving gel rather than their manly gel.This works wonders for moisturizing, conditioning, and hydrating dry skin while also providing excellent shaving results. It also contains vitamin E, olive butter, lanolin, and a few additional skin conditioners which leaves the skin feeling smooth and soft.This creates a thick lather and doesn't leave any lumps when I use a throwaway razor. It will last me three times as long, smells good and comes in three the normal-size bottles.",

                "reviewText": "This has been my favorite shave gel for a long, long time and I'm finally ordering it now because I sometimes need it faster than I can get out to buy some. Each container is filled with a smooth gel that turns foamy once applied to your skin. I especially enjoy using this on my legs but it seems to work anywhere. It never clogs up my razor and rinses off clean with no residue. To say you will be pampering your skin is probably an understatement. This raspberry gel is heavenly although I seem to remember it being a little more strongly scented in the past. So maybe they've reduced the scent a bit due to sensitivity.~The Rebecca Review",

It's also a great deal, which I really appreciate.",
