                "reviewText": "Very, very good shave gel, and the aloe formula cushions the blade very well. Almost, but not quite, as rich as the canned gel from that mail-order shaving supplier that starts with \"H,\" which has been my go-to gel. Haven't ever cut myself when using either gel, which is my #1 criterion for quality shave gel, so Gillette passes my main test. Feels comparable to H, too, as long as you use enough. Because of this, though, the Gillette gel looks as though it may not last as long. It is less expensive, however, so it may come out about the same, cost-wise. YMMV in terms of how long it lasts, of course.I definitely, definitely prefer the scent of this Gillette gel. Some complain that this gel smells like laundry detergent, but I don't understand that at all. To me, it smells like cinnamon and mint mixed with sort of a powdery scent, which is great, and to me isn't heavy at all. Lasts a while, though, so if you want a scent that goes away quickly, no matter how light or pleasant it is, look elsewhere.Overall, I am very happy with this Gillette shave gel. It's a shame that it might not last as long or be as rich as what I was using, but that seems to be the sacrifice for less cost upfront, and the smell is preferable, in my opinion. Verdict: try it, it's pretty good!",
