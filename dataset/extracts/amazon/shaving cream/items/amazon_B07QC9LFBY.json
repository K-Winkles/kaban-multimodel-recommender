They aren\u2019t kidding about pressing firmly and doing quick continuous strokes - if you don\u2019t do that this will tug your hair and not shave very well. The shaving experience..... I wouldn\u2019t call it pleasant because it is kind of like sandpapering your head. But, this thing gives me a closer shave than I get from a single pass with a safety razor, I haven\u2019t gotten any cuts, and it\u2019s much faster. A couple times my skin has been pretty red and had that rubbed-raw feeling but I put their shave butter on once I\u2019m done shaving (and before obviously) and that seems to remove all redness and irritation within a few hours. So, I\u2019m still looking for my favorite head shaving method but at least for now this is my go-to.",

                "reviewText": "I like this product a lot. I've only been shaving my head for a short time. I started using OmniShaver, which I find easy to use, effective and efficient. The OmniShaver Shave Butter really improves the whole experience. A very small amount goes a long way. It provides for a really smooth shave. As noted elsewhere, it helps to wet your head first and to follow the instructions to take long, firm strokes. My head was clean, remarkably smooth, and--well, I was pleased with the results. The price struck me as a little high, until I realized how little I needed to use at a time. I don't have a lot of products to compare it to in terms of quality or cost, but I'm very happy with this one.",
