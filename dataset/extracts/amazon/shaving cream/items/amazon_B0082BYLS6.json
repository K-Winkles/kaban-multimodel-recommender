The one that made us so popular amongst Italian men and Barbers. Developed for any beard on any man, Proraso\u2019s Pre-Shave Cream formula has a particularly rich, concentrated, non-greasy texture that softens stubble and improves the skin's elasticity for a problem-free, perfect shave. The cooling ingredients leave your face feeling toned and invigorated. Eucalyptus oil tones and purifies your skin and facial hair, while menthol helps refresh and revitalize. How to use: Wet your face with warm water or a damp, hot towel and apply a dollop (about a pea-size) of Pre-Shave Cream to your face. Massage with circular motions and do not rinse. Shave normally with Proraso Shaving Cream or Soap. Barber's choice since 1948 Dermatologist tested No parabens, no silicones No mineral oil, no SLS No artificial colors No ingredients of animal origin Over 95% natural Made in Italy",

Always use a Proraso Pre-Shave cream It softens and straightens the hairs, making it easier to apply the shaving cream to your beard and pre-conditions the skin. Wrap your face in a warm, wet towel Just like traditional barbers do. Otherwise, shave after your morning shower when the skin is soft and hydrated from the warm water. The best lather comes from a brush and shaving cream or soap Applying shaving cream or soap with a brush increases the volume of your beard hair and allows for a closer shave. To build up a rich lather, wet your shaving brush and apply the cream in fast, repeated circular motions to coat the brush bristles well.",

Keep your razor clean Rinse the blade with hot water at least once every two swipes of the razor. Residue from past shaves can reduce the blades' effectiveness and increase the risk of damaging your skin. Also, remember to change your razor often. For the perfect shave, one pass just doesn't cut it Lather your face a second time and repeat the shave. Don't neglect your post-shave routine Rinse your face well and repeatedly to remove any residue.",

                "reviewText": "Long story short, I'm 58 years old and have never had a better shave in my life, ever, than with Proraso shaving products. I recently stumbled across Proraso when the shaving soap I normally use was sold out on Amazon and boy am I glad I did. It is an amazing experience to use such high quality shaving soap and products. From the pre-shave cream, to the tubed shaving creme, to the after shave lotion, never before have I enjoyed such a close and comfortable shave. The pre-shave cream is amazing and sets the stage for a perfect shave. It gives an initial \"freeze\" of menthol and eucalyptus that invigorates and provides a base lubricity that really helps your razer glide. The tubed shaving cream is absolutely opulent in texture. So smooth and velvety, a pleasure to use, and a real luxury. The after shave lotion not only smells great but leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I like the fact that the scent doesn't linger as I have cologne that I use if I wish to \"wear\" a scent. I use the \"Refreshing\" blend and love the menthol and eucalyptus properties of these products as they make shaving a pleasure and leave my skin in excellent condition, feeling great. I am definitely a Proraso customer for life!",

                "reviewText": "If you have a coarse beard, suffer from irritation, or any other shaving malady, you need to try this product. I've tried other pre-shave preps and nothing compares to this. The shave oils are too greasy and make my skin break out. Proraso is a unique cream.It is easy to apply. Just a little dab and rub it well into your face. I love the tingling sensation and the menthol. It just feels great going on. More importantly, this stuff is really softening your beard. I let it sit for about a minute before applying shave cream. Of course, I also use Proraso in the tube with a bowl/brush. Nothing fancy or expensive. Put the lather on top of the pre-shave and proceed as normal. You will find that your razor glides effortlessly. Your skin is not only hydrated but does not get roughed up.Using this daily can result in much softer and smoother skin. I use a DE safety razor, and the pre-shave routine has changed my shaving experience dramatically. Softening the whiskers is a challenge, especially if you live in an area with hard water. This product really does weaken the whiskers so your blade can just mow them down. I get a much closer shave now, no irritation, seldom a nick. Plus, your skin is so soft and shiny when you are done.When I am done shaving, I don't feel the need to use any aftershave. Just an alum block and a splash of cold water, and I'm good to go. (buy quality alum made in France, not made in India or China). Some folks even use this pre-shave as a post-shave, but I don't. Depending on your skin type, you'll have to decide on your post-shave routine.Not really important, but I just love that the jar is glass, not that packaging really matters. The glass jar indicates how committed Proraso is to quality throughout the entire product experience. Quality packaging emanates the feeling of luxury.A jar will last you several months with daily shaving. This is a small price to pay given how much it improves the shave experience. This product is so good, I wouldn't care if I had to buy it twice as often at twice the price.Save your face for pennies a day, and look your very best.BTW- I am a bonafide buyer of this product and have voluntarily submitted this review. No inducement or compensation from anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I am generally not an advocate for multi-step skincare products (e.g. toners, pre-shave oils, etc.). Why make things complicated? However, I recently found myself ordering several new shaving items, as an alternative to the Aveeno I\u2019ve been using for a long while. Here\u2019s my current shaving kit:- Merkur razor- A faux-badger shaving brush, by the Body Shop- Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades- Proraso Pre-shave Cream- Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving CreamProraso doesn\u2019t generate a lot of lather when applied with a brush. You don\u2019t use much. It simply dries in a thin layer on your face. It doesn\u2019t feel slick, oily or silicone-like on skin. It\u2019s nothing like the lubrication strips fond on cartridge razors. What it does bring is the scent and tingle of menthol, in abundance. Your face feels like it\u2019s taking a slow-boat tour of Antarctica, which, for me, is a good thing. If you\u2019re sensitive or averse to the smell of eucalyptus \u2026 next product, please.Applying shave cream on top doesn\u2019t disturb Proraso; it stays happily in its own layer, next to your face, glowing like a mentholated nuclear power plant. In terms of the actual shave itself, what I notice with Proraso is an almost complete lack of drama. There is none of the tugging, scraping, pulling or bleeding that characterizes a bad shave. I don\u2019t know how Proraso is accomplishing this feat (and, who knows, perhaps the Taylor\u2019s shaving cream is contributing something positive), but the results are undeniable. The best part is that, after shaving my face feels moist and conditioned, rather than stripped or dried out, as can be the case with supermarket shaving creams. There\u2019s no rush for the after shave bottle.In summary, Proraso feels like a slightly old-fashioned shaving product, from a time when people knew a lot more than we do about what made for a good shave.",

I did have to return this one back but only because Amazon had a special offer for the larger size container of the pre-shave cream so I ended up buying the bigger version of this one. However I do have a small pot which I takeaway with me for travelling which is useful. Overall I find that the shave quality is amazing when you're using this pre-shaved balm and makes such a big difference and gives you that nice cooling effect as well. Overall very happy with this brand and it will be a continued for future purchase from me. Highly recommended",
