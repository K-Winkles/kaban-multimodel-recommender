                "reviewText": "My husband has had a beard \u201cforever\u201d and enjoys a wide variety of Viking products. This review is for the aftershave balm, and I think it\u2019s an overlooked product that some bearded men forget about.Even if you have a full beard, there are usually areas where you shave down to the skin. For my husband, he takes a little off the top of his cheeks and then shaves his neck. His neck in particular can become a little irritated after a clean shave and this product does a great job healing his skin.He shaves his neck about 5 times a week and usually applies this immediately after shaving. It sprays on cleanly, but he\u2019ll then kind of massage it into his skin. He finds it soothing and hydrating and immediately neutralizes the irritation of shaving. Once a week he trims his beard, shaves, and then showers. Applying the balm after the shower seems to work just as well, with the delay not interfering with the recovery.It smells great, and the vanilla can be paired with other scents as well. For example, he has a more earthy sandalwood beard balm and the two scents compliment each other.Like I mentioned earlier, he has several Viking products in his rotation and they are all great. And they all compliment each other. This after shave balm is highly recommended!My star ratings explained:5 stars = Exceptional. I recommend to friends.4 stars = Exceeded expectations.3 stars = Met expectations. Satisfied with purchase but not overwhelmed.2 stars = Failed to meet expectations but usable.1 star = Avoid.",

I think my only concern is how much I need to use each time to soothe my shaved facial areas and just how long this 4oz bottle will last? It just rubs in SO quickly it doesn't seem to go very far!I guess time will tell, but until then I shall enjoy the smooth, pleasant scent of my freshly shaven skin thanks to Striking Viking Vanilla After Shave Balm!",

                "reviewText": "It's been a while since I used a pre-shave oil so I thought I would give this one a shot. I'm a clean shaven guy, going more than 2 days without shaving usually drives me nuts. To test it out I went 3 days which for me was a decent amount of growth, enough to clog a cartridge razor for sure.One thing I noticed right away... Get your reading glasses out if you want to read the directions on the bottle... That's a lot of words in a small place to basically say: put a dime sized bit on your hand and massage it into your clean face. After lamenting the fact that I apparently need reading glasses, I managed to read enough to figure it out and easily measured out that dime sized bit of oil into my hand. Let me tell you, you can kind smell the vanilla from the bottle but when you rub it into your face it smells AWESOME. It's a rich deep vanilla, not an annoying fake smelling scent at all. Once applied I grabbed my Bump Patrol shave gel, and proceeded to lather up my face. Immediately I noticed that it did a MUCH better job of building a lather up. The Bump Patrol is great for avoiding shaving bumps for me but it's always been a bit weak on the lather... by adding this oil first I got a great lather.Now... I do shave with a DE safety razor so I get a pretty good shave all the time but my Alpha razor felt like it performed exceptionally well with my face all oiled and lathered up. Not a single nick, even with a few bumps, and after shaving my face already felt moisturized. Definite win!",

                "reviewText": "First, the scent of this pre shave oil is wonderful. A very rich and warm vanilla. Not girly but not so macho a woman can't enjoy it as well.My guy loves the feel of it on his skin and his skin is less dry after shaving. Seems to be a slightly closer shave as well. I tested it on my legs and loved it, almost kept it.The bottle isn't large but so far it's lasted longer than expected. Probably would have gone faster had I kept using it on my legs.",

He said it definitely gave him a smoother shave than regular shaving cream that he uses and his face felt much softer afterwards. He said he doesnt want a beauty routine but he could see himself using something like this so i let my daughter know where i got it !Definitely a winner !",

                "reviewText": "Hubby didn't particularly care for the vanilla scent, but it does fade quickly. My husband shaves daily and he applied this just before using his electric razor. He tells me he didn't notice that the shave was any better with the oil, but he liked the feel of the product on his face and felt like it protected his skin well. I gave it a try on my underarms and legs and found that I got a little better hair removal on my legs. Take note that you will also need to rinse your razor more frequently because the oil and hair will accumulate more than standard shaving gel. My legs felt very smooth and I didn't need to apply as much lotion afterwards.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, it smells great. Almost too good, I want to eat it, the forbidden pudding. Once you quash your desire to eat it and actually use it, the shave goes real well. It's thick and creamy and lathers up real nice, and you hardly need any. The blade moves smoothly, and doesn't irritate as much as shaving dry. The downside is that you have to rinse the hair off, because it gets caught up in the foam, but the upside is that thick hair doesn't fly all over the place and poke your eye out. But a bit more of a production than doing a trim over a trash can, dusting off, and calling it done. The extra work pays off, however, because the shave is much closer and smoother than without it. And it even leaves your skin real soft and moisturized. Overall I can't recommend it enough.This is a review for Striking Viking Shaving Cream for Men, Vanilla Scented (5.3 Oz) Shaving Cream Mens - Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream That Helps Moisturize, Protect and Soothe the Skin",
