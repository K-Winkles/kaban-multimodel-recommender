                "reviewText": "After using Anthony's pre-shave oil, the gel is terrific..you probably could use an AXE, and you wouldn't cut yourself..another good thing is you only need a little and lather it all over your face...of course, the BEST way to shave is IN THE SHOWER, NOT over the sink...a shave expert in London told me that was \" barbaric & caveman style\". He told me to buy a small mirror for the shower, let the warm water splash on my face for 30 seconds to get it moist & soft, then apply the pre-shave oil & Anthony's Gel. The difference in the shaving experience this way is the differnce between a Ritz- Carlton and a Motel 6. I used to use EDGE, or something similar, that was cheap & easy to find. Now I haven't used that low-end stuff in 15 years. And like I said in my pre-shave review, I've cut myself MAYBE 5 times in 15 years. Other great brands are ELEMIS ( THE BEST, but most $$$), Geoff Trumper's, Key West Aloe Frictionless Shave Cream, and The Art Of Shaving products. You'll LOVE the way your face feels afterwards..Ladies, this would make a great present for any man..don't forget another great reason to shave in the shower is that you don't make a mess with your beard hairs all over the sink- they go directly into the shower drain. I bring my shaving mirror everywhere ( I have 2-one for my home shower, one portable)..try this, you'll actually NOT mind shaving ( imagine that!)",

                "reviewText": "Over the years I've tried just about every shaving cream and gel available. The cheap supermarket stuff does nothing but leave me with a face full of bloody nicks. Creams often give me razor burn, plus you simply can't *see* what you're shaving underneath the layer of whiteness.Finally I found Anthony Shave Gel, and I've been a faithful user for at least six or seven years now. I've used it on a day's stubble and a week's stubble, with little difference in result. I've used it with a variety of razors, from MACH 3s to Fusions to the current ones I get from the Dollar Shave Club. The results are almost always uniform. I don't even have problems shaving against the grain, to get that super-close cut, and I NEVER get razor burn.I've noticed Anthony has subtly changed the product over the years; now it has new packaging (the white bottle pictured here is now dark gray and black) and a bit more of the moisturizing beads inside. I haven't noticed much difference on my face, though. It's all worked great. I'll continue using this product as long as they keep making it! (and I hope that's a while - I've seen too many of my favorite men's products disappear from the market, plus a number of my local stores no longer carry the Anthony Logistics line at all)",

After using it four times, it caused a severe rash and burning sensation on my face, with the redness lasting a few hours. It was embarrassing to go to work looking like that. I decided to give it another chance, but the same reaction occurred again, and then a third time. My wife suggested returning it, but we thought perhaps the specific bottle was defective. We ended up trying four different bottles, using each one time, and each caused the same reaction. I\u2019m aware that my return window has closed, but I would like a refund as it seems every new bottle I try results in the same rash and burns on my face. I honestly don\u2019t think I will purchase this product again.",

Anthony arbeitet mit Menthol und Aloevera. Die \u00c4therischen \u00d6le haben eine K\u00fchleffekt, der einfach erfrischend und super angenehm ist. Der Verzicht auf Alkohol und die Zugabe von Aloevera machen das Geld extrem vertr\u00e4glich. Ich bin damit die \u00fcblichen Hautirritationen nach der Rasur losgeworden. Sehr zu empfehlen!
