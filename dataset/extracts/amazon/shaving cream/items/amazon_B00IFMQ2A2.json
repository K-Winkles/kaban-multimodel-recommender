This means extra hydration for your skin, excellent razor protection, and a cleaner, better shaving experience. It also means that you can use the razor of your choice when shaving whether that\u2019s a single or multi-blade. And because we use a shave oil base, your skin won\u2019t be nearly as dry or stripped after shaving. Instead, it\u2019ll feel smooth and hydrated. Directions for use Start by applying a small amount of shaving gel to your fingertips. Rub the product in a circular motion so that it lifts the hair in the area in need of a shave. This can be done with your fingers or a shave brush. Use your favorite razor for a high quality shave. You also don\u2019t need to use water with our shaving gel unless you want to. Our gel lathers perfectly on its own. For best results, use with our EZ Blade Double Edged Razors and EZ Blade Badger Brush. Follow up with our EZ Blade Aftershave Tonic or Lotion for silky, hydrated skin. Features Shave oil based for a more comfortable shaving experienceNo water required- simply apply and shaveOur formula allows the blade to glide effortlessly across the skinClear non foam gel means you can see every hairOur gel opens pores, relaxes the skin and softens even the coarsest beard hairs",

                "reviewText": "I initially purchased this gel to use for my cheeks and my neck area so that I could see exactly what I was shaving so I wouldn't keep shaving hairs off my beard. I was using a regular shaving cream which made it difficult to see what I was doing and would result in my beard slowly dwindling away after each shave.I decided on this particular product because of the reviews and because it was available for same say shipping. As soon as I received it, I tried it out and was amazed out how smooth my face was. Despite the dull blade, my shave was smoother than with any other product I have ever used and I had no irritation afterward.I later decided to try to see how it did shaving my head. At first it seemed a little odd as it goes on clear and just a thin layer is all that is needed making it feel like there was nothing there. After the first pass, I knew that the new badger brush I bought and had only used once would now reside in the drawer along with a nearly unused tube of Italian shaving cream.The gel looks like green slime in the container but when applied to the skin is completely clear and has a nice, clean lime scent. Although it has a shaving oil in it, it is not greasy at all and washes off my razor easily. Another benefit is that no water or anything else is required making the process faster and less messy. It also does not leave a residue in my sink like the Italian stuff did.Needless to say, I am extremely happy I found this stuff.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff had to be made by the shaving gods!First, let me tell you that i tried each and every method possible for a smooth shave. I started with the regular shaving cream. Broke me out BADLY! Then I switched to the aveeno. I mean it's natural right? BROKE ME OUT BADLY! Then I said, I'll just use clippers. Well that didn't work well either. Just bad hair bumps (One my prone African American skin). So I switched to a shavette and a Shea Moisture cream like product. Smelled good, decent results, but goopy and inconsistent feel. Which led me to this.While searching for a oil based product, I learned about clear gel shaving. After cross shopping with other brands, I decided on EZ-Blade. I absolutely love this product. The clear application. The soothing facial feel. The glide... I made shaving feel like I was buttering toast. Effortless. And the price wasn't that badMy only gripe i have is that it dries super fast, so I have to reapply to certain areas that I have to be more precise on. But that isn't a big deal, I mean the jar is a great size.Overall, I think I have found my lifetime shaving companion. It leaves my skin smooth as baby's bottom (cliche I know, but so true). I would recommend this to everyone I know.",

                "reviewText": "mine arrived with lid cracked , in an envelope (not a box). This mint green gel cream should be sold in a tube.I like the cream but you have to apply a LOT of it to get a good shave. I anticipate going through this jar easily within one month and again it has no lid.. the product is as advertised but there are two issues: 1) you must really apply a lot of this gel and shave quickly before it dries 2) it doesn\u2019t remove easily. I have to use water to remove . The irony is I use water to remove a waterless shave cream, which defeats the purpose. I\u2019d buy this again because I can shave my head outdoors or quickly in a public restroom (if my jar had a lid!).. but you really have to over-apply this, and then to remove its residue (perhaps because I over apply), I need water . The only way I can make this work without irritation is to apply massive amounts . I\u2019d buy it again , though, and that\u2019s the bottom like. It\u2019s just I\u2019ll have to buy more frequently than soap or cream. I shave my face with cream. I shave my head with EZ. I like the scent.,",

The shave was smooth he never got an irritation from it, and his skin was baby soft afterwards. I even used it with out shortening the shaving area furst. I loved that i could see what i was shaving as well so i didnt shave his beard any. I used it as the product suggested. Maybe a smidge more then recommended. . I even enjoyed shaving his face. I will have to do it regularly now.",
