                "reviewText": "I was really excited to try this product. I had a beard and was only shaving my cheeks and the bottom of my neck. I first tried it using a shaving brush which was not the way to go. It would not generate a lather and the brush was difficult to clean. The next day I decided to cut my beard off with clippers and then tried the cream again, this time wetting my face with hot water and applying it with my fingers. I used a lot more of it this time and found it to be a terrible shaving experience. I found the product to be more like cold cream than shaving cream. It was very greasy and clogged up my razor to the extent that I had to replace the blade (it was brand new). This product is so bad, that I will not use it again as I have already tossed it in the trash.",
