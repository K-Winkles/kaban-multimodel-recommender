With this product and a brush you can really form a nice thick lather and then spread it well onto your face. Also, being about the size of a tube of toothpaste this is much easier to pack and carry through airport security with the liquid limitations, especially when compared to even a small can of shaving cream and will last so much longer. I switched to this shaving cream years ago and dont plan on changing back.",

This is the best shaving cream I've found in many years of searching.The key is that it enables the razor to glide over my skin while not \"over-protecting\". All shave creams are formulated to enable a razor to glide over skin while preventing razor drag or burn. The problem with almost all of them in my experience is that they do too good a job of protecting: I end up with what I call \"micro-stubble\" that I need to remove after wet shaving by putting some hand lotion on my beard area and finishing the job.Nivea Men Original doesn't over-protect. At the same time it does a superlative job of eliminating razor drag and razor burn. I don't have a heavy beard. I can but suspect that those with heavier beards will like Nivea Men Original even more than I do.So if I like it that much, why not five stars? A minor annoyance is that the top of the tube must be screwed off and back on. That can sometimes be a bit annoying. A fifth start awaits a flip-top...",
