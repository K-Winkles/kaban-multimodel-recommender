                "reviewText": "I ordered the classic version. This shaving cream actually works better than I thought it would. You can spread it on your face with your hand and/or use a brush to lather. A lot of other creams I tried, instead of lathering more, disappear when I use a brush. This one gives a decent foam but doesn\u2019t foam up as much as shown in the product picture with the amount I am using (which is enough for shaving my face), so I suspect you\u2019ll run through the tube quickly if you want a rich foam. It does soften the skin well, and I went through shaving without a nick even though I am using a classic barber\u2019s razor. I didn\u2019t notice the tube would be this small, despite the word \u201ctravel\u201d in its description. The tube comes sealed under the cap and inside a sealed box, which gave me a good first impression. I think it is a bit expensive for its size, but there is nothing wrong with it as a shaving cream.",

                "reviewText": "At first test, I had great success applying this \u201cultra slick\u201d men\u2019s shaving cream by Lakerain, following the instructions on the box, prepping with cleanser and warm water. Second test, I applied it dry, and it worked just as well, and I didn\u2019t feel irritation or pulling from my 2-day old safety razor.Application is smooth, and the feeling is as described on the Brand page (HWSHQY OO) - \u201cUltra Slick\u201d. I have some sensitivity to certain shave creams, including Aloe Vera infused, but had only a pleasant reaction to this one.There are two options, CLASSIC ORIGINAL (red box - the one I tested) and VANILLA (green box). I can attest that the cream I tested softens my beard, had a pleasant (mostly subtle citrus) fragrance, and cleaned with warm water without leaving an oily residue. It compares favorably to higher end shave treatments (I\u2019ve tried so many of them!)At the size of this tube, 1 fluid ounce, for me it is an automatic travel-friendly companion. I use just a drop so the tube should last me a few business trips.",
