This shaving cream smells so good and helps me have such a clean close shave that when I look in the mirror, I'm actually better looking (ha, ha) now, then before I shaved with Clubman Pinaud. I also recommend you buy this and their talcom (after shower) power. I bought the three pack of it. Spoil yourself. You deserve it and Club Pinaud cand help you.",
