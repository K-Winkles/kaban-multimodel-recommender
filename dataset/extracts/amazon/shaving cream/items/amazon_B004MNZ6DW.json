I switched to this kind of shaving cream about ten years ago because of the mess and inconvenience of aerosol cans whether foam or gel. I also don\u2019t like having to buy a separate smaller can for flying. I was using a similar product from Neutrogena. Conveniently, these kinds of shaving cream are much better for decreasing irritation as well. I was sent a free sample when I ordered another men\u2019s grooming product on Amazon and was immediately hooked. I\u2019ve been a loyal customer since then. Added benefit: it\u2019s not full of lab-made, complicated chemicals that are illegal in Europe.",

The more conventional stuff foams up and easily washes away. If you use too much, it clogs your razor easily and makes shaving take longer since you're trying to clear out between the blades. If you use less than you're used to using (with other products) it's much more manageable. It's also quite expensive, definitely a bit of a shock if you're coming from like $2.99 shaving cream. I think it's worth it though, if you need a vegan option for sensitive skin.",
