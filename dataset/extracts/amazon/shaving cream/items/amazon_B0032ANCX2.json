                "reviewText": "I have been using the Skintimate Shaving Gels for a long time. I have used the different varieties including this one with the vitamins and aloe (in the purple can) and the Sensitive Skin (in the pink can) and really like them all as long as it's the gel. I feel like the gel works better and a little dab foams up into a fairly firm foam to go a long way and stands up to get a very smooth shave. There is never any irritation and skin feels smooth and well moisturized. The gels all have a great scent too. I am glad I can buy them on Amazon for a reasonable price and quick delivery.",
