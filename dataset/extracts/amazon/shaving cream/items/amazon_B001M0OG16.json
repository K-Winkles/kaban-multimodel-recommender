                "reviewText": "I have to agree with Ben T. on this, \"this is the most luxurious I've tried. I use a badger brush for application and this the best at providing a good second application with the same, initial small amount of shaving cream. It lathers up great and barely dissipates from first to second application.\"My husband has tried a couple different kinds of shaving creams and likes this one the best. He shaves right after a hot shower and usually keeps the sink water running rather than washing his blade off in a sink full of water. The shaving cream does leave a thick residue on the sink.I personally like the way this one smells. I have smelled other Sandalwood products from other vendors, and I haven't found one I like as much as this one, so far. It is fresh smelling with a hint of woodsy / spicey smell. While it is aromatic, the smell left on the skin is very light and tends to wear off quickly. He also tried the lavender cream from G.F. Trumper and I did not like that one as much.Although there are other products out there for us to try, I think for now my husband is very satisfied with this one.",

                "reviewText": "Reviewed by my husband:I have shaved with canned products my entire life. I was looking for something to improve the shaving experience when I came across these \"old tyme\" shaving creams. Reviews were outstanding for these products across several brands, so after my own research, I decided on Trumpers. This decision was based on a combination of performance, price, and scent.The performance of this product is great. I feel like I am able to get a closer, more comfortable shave than ever. A little bit creates a plentiful lather for several passes, if you choose. I have followed recommendations I've seen elsewhere and shave with the grain on the first pass, re-apply lathered shave cream, then shave against the grain either laterally or vertically. Even against the grain my skin is less irritated compared to canned products, and my skin is quite sensitive.I have given 4 stars instead of 5 because of the scent. Many have described it as the smell of an old tyme barber shop. Unfortunately my life experience has not exposed me to this smell, so I can't say whether that's accurate or not. I have smelled Sandalwood, however, so I did have some expectation for how this would smell. In comparing this to other products, my conclusion was that Trumpers Sandalwood was better smelling than other brands. My opinion on the scent is that there is a hint of Sandalwood, but not much. It has more of a scent that I cannot place, which I suppose might be the old tyme barber shop that others have mentioned. It is not bad, but it would be better with a stronger Sandalwood presence, in my opinion. I also was surprised at how light the scent is. From other reviews, I expected it might linger for a few hours post-shave, but this is not the case in my experience. It seems to be completely gone within an hour or less. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I had hoped for longer.Overall I would definitely recommend dumping the drug store cans and going with a shaving cream like this. I haven't used other brands, so I can't compare there, but I am happy with this product.",

                "reviewText": "Fantastic! Being a Taylor of Old Bond Street fan, I was curious to try this shaving cream based on all the excellent reviews. Wow... Now I understand why people love this stuff; it's excellent! Taylor's sandalwood shaving cream is also very good, but the scent is way to powerful for me. It smells so powerful, it gives me a headache. Trumper's sandalwood cream is as close to perfect as I can imagine. The scent lasts into the afternoon, and if I enjoy it this much, I'm sure others around me do as well.I also recommend \" Geo F. Trumper's Sandalwood Skin Food, 200ml \", which is an excellent aftershave balm, also with a sandalwood scent. You only need three or four drops to totally cover your face, so the bottle will last a very long time. It hydrates your face post shave and leaves a fantastic scent that's the same as their sandalwood shaving cream.",
