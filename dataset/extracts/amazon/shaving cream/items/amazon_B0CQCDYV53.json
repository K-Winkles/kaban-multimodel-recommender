                "reviewText": "Before this Schick Hydro Silk shave cream, I'd never tried a shaving cream that wasn't the foaming type, and I was concerned it wouldn't work as well as my preferred brand (Satin Care Sensitive). I was also worried I'd react to the scent, either dermatologically or with my sinuses, since I tend to be sensitive to fragrances.I'm pleased to say the Water Lily scent is light, pretty, and not overly perfumey or floral, and I had no reactions at all to any part of the cream. In fact, it left my skin softer than it typically does after shaving AND adding lotion. I definitely like that!As far as how it worked, I discovered that 1) a little bit actually goes a long way, even though it doesn't seem like it will, and 2) the coarser the hair, the better the benefit. By this, I mean that the cream didn't do as good of a job on my legs as my usual foaming choice. It worked better on my armpits, equal to, if not slightly smoother than, the shave I get with my typical shaving cream, though my underarm skin felt much softer after shaving with the Schick. But the bikini area is where this cream truly shined (which makes sense since the advertising makes it seem as if that's what it's designed for). I've never achieved as smooth a shave as fast as I did with this cream\u2014and this was using my standard razor, not a special one designed for bikini shaving\u2014all with no irritation, abrasions, or stray escapees.I'm seriously impressed and will definitely be adding this to my bathroom staples list.",

It enables you to get a very close shave, and definitely protects your legs from any abrasion from the razor. The directions recommend rubbing any unused foam into your skin after shaving, so it really does act as a moisturizer.The consistency is very dense and rich. It reminds me of a 40% shea butter hand cream or similar. I like that the aloe vera and shea butter make it very gentle on the skin.",

I will admit that it is nice and creamy and helps create a smooth shave. The smell isn't overpowering, and I didn't suffer from any nicks or bumps. As a shaving cream, it's really nice.All that being said, I'm not wholly on board with the moisturizing claims. I've used it as directed to the best of my ability, but it doesn't seem to moisturize as effectively as simply taking the extra step to slather on some standard lotion after you dry off. Plus, drying off takes a little more time and is slightly more awkward because you don't want your towel to wipe any of the product off.Overall, it's a decent product if you're just looking for a shaving cream, but if you're looking for a moisturizer, just stick to regular lotion.",

The fragrance its also nice as it worked with the overall feel of the product. From my point of few it could have been a bit more soft overall but it still worked out nicely. I used it in combination with a Schick hydro razor and it got the job done for me.",
