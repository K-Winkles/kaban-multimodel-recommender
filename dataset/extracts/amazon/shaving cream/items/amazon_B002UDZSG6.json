My problem I have with it is by the time I apply the cream to my face the lather starts to dissolve and by the time I get to the other side of my face the lather has become very thin. I have tried adding water, removing water, adding more cream and I still end up with the same scenario. The other thing I have noticed is, with my skin when I shave with the Men-u it feels sticky which does not allow my razor to slide smoothly down my face. If you are debating on trying this I would say to give it a try. Maybe it will work better for you. It does make a lot of lather and it did work better then some of the creams I tried, I just found something that works better for me.",

                "reviewText": "Over the years I've tried a variety of shaving techniques--blade and electric--to achieve a close shave without lacerating myself. Eventually I developed a routine of doing a \"preshave\" with an electric shaver (various brands), following up with a blade shave. For about the last year and a half I've been using Men-u Shave cream, applying one pumpful on my dry beard, wetting the foil of a Panasonic wet/dry shaver, and then shaving. This cuts the electric shave time in about half. I follow that with another pumpful of shave cream and do a blade shave. This has solved the laceration problem, and the blades, of course, last much longer. The cream has a fresh fragrance. The other thing I like about the Men-u product is that is TSA compliant, and the locking mechanism stops the pump from activating while in transit.",

This is super-concentrated...one pump covers my entire face and neck. It lubricates really well, provides for a very close shave, and has enough \"stay\" to allow several passes with the razor. There is no fragrance to speak of, rinses off my face well, and doesn't clog my razor. The container is solidly designed for carryon travel. There are more expensive products out their, but I doubt you'll find a closer shave.I'm waiting to see just how long the bottle lasts, and will update with results.",

                "reviewText": "First, let share that my perspective of shaving is pretty simple. I don't uses brushes, bowls or really any fancy shaving products or other men's products. I just want a close, but quick shave, and I have a tougher than average beard. And I travel about 30% of the time. This has become my one shave cream for both home and my always packed duplicate travel kit.Compared to gels which foam up quite a bit, this is a much thinner, \"see through\" coating on your face. At first that made me skeptical, but I quickly found it was every bit as effective as even the best brands of canned gel shave creams but has a few key benefits over the cans.1) because it is almost \"see through\" you can actually shave more carefully.2) because you use so much less \"volume\" it makes much less mess around the sink.3) the container doesn't leave rust stains or cream drippings from the spout on my bathroom closet shelf, and takes up way less space.4) the small size is perfect for airline travel, and I never have to guess or worry if there is enough left in my travel bottle to get through a whole trip, whereas with a can I never really knew how much was left once below a half can.Lastly, I have found that when I have used up 90% or so of the pump bottle that is I run a little bit of tap back into the bottle I can still get another 25 or so shaves. I really don't think this costs more per shave than drugstore gels, or if so, it's marginal.",

Instructions are very easy to follow.Did not wet hair, a very, very small amount on the palm of my hand and just rub it on. It was amazing for such a small quantity. Had a great shave and the best one I have ever had!It also means that I no longer have to wet my hair first and the use shaving soap & shaving brush.Also less and easier to pack and use when away.Recommend this product and it is good for those who shave their head - MagicWill definately buy again.",
