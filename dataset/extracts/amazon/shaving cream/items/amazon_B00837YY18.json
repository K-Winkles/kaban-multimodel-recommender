        "description": "Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning Proraso Shave Soap, Refreshing and Toning, is developed for any beard on any man. Eucalyptus oil tones and purifies your facial hair and skin, while menthol helps refresh and revitalize. Proraso's Shave Soap is still made following a rigorous, 'hot soap'-making process, during which it's left to mature for 10 days in small batches -- when much of the moisture evaporates -- resulting in a more concentrated, richer soap that produces an amazing lather. How to use: Soak your Proraso brush in a bowl or cup filled with hot water for a few minutes before your shave. Apply a warm, damp towel to your face (or splash face with warm water) to prep your face for shaving, then apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream. Apply another hot towel to your face for a few seconds. After the brush has soaked, gently squeeze out excess water, still leaving the brush mostly wet. Apply the brush to the soap in fast, repeated circular motions to coat the brush bristles well. Spread on your beard and proceed with shaving. Close the lid after use to keep the soap from drying out (though, even if it does dry out, it will not lose its efficacy or beneficial properties when reused). Shave and rinse face thoroughly. For an optimal experience, finish with another application of your warm, damp towel, followed by your favorite Proraso After Shave Balm or Lotion. Short on time? Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face (for optimal results). To build up a rich lather, run your shaving brush under hot water for about 30 seconds, if you don't have time to soak it. Apply the brush to the soap in fast, repeated circular motions to coat the brush bristles well. Spread on your beard, shave and rinse, following with your favorite Proraso After Shave Balm or Lotion. Barber's choice since 1948 No parabens, no silicones No mineral oil, no SLS No artificial colors No ingredients of animal origin Over 95% natural Made in Italy",

That's actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, you\u2019ll need more water on your shaving brush (we'd suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesn\u2019t dry out. Once you do, you\u2019ll really see the difference (and why it\u2019s become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).",

Always use a Proraso Pre-Shave Cream It softens and straightens the hairs, making it easier to apply the shaving cream to your beard and pre-conditions the skin. Wrap your face in a warm, wet towel Just like traditional barbers do. Otherwise, shave after your morning shower when the skin is soft and hydrated from the warm water. The best lather comes from a brush and shaving cream or soap Applying shaving cream or soap with a brush increases the volume of your beard hair and allows for a closer shave.

I started looking into the badger brush- soap puck method Because I wanted to feel more like a man and have a better shave. Lol. I\u2019ve also recently been dealing with some irritation and ingrown hairs on my neck. This stuff is amazing. I\u2019ve never had a smoother shave. I\u2019ve been questioning whether my blades were just dull. But that wasn\u2019t the issue. The scent is very light in my opinion and reminds me of the old classic barber shop feel. There\u2019s just something about this that I love. Stop looking at all the negative comments and buy this. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been looking for.",

This led to a much less close shave but also saved me from cutting myself. Apparently in the pre-internet era, I had not properly learned how to shave. Being frustrated with the lack of close shave, I decided to give safety razor (\u201cwet shaving\u201d) another try. I am extremely glad that I did. I felt it was necessary to invest in quality but not the most expensive items to start. I began with the Merkur 34C razor, Israeli Personna (Personna Red) blades, the Parker silvertip brush and the Proraso shaving soap. The next step was to provide for a travel kit. This was accomplished with a cheap boar brush (not evaluated here) and Taylor of Old Bond Street Traditional shaving soap along with the Merkur razor. I next upgraded my travel kit to Simpson\u2019s Wee Scot brush and Tabac shaving stick. My home supplies were upgraded to add the Simpson\u2019s Classic 2 and Chubby 1 brushes, Mitchells Wool Fat shaving soap, Tabac shaving soap (after purchasing the stick), and the Lucky Tiger aftershave.Merkur 34C razor \u2013 I find this to be an excellent razor. It fits my hand well, gives great control with the short handle and provides for a clean comfortable close shave that is not too aggressive. The only criticism that I have is the finish is not as nice as certain other brands. When my luggage was temporarily lost, I purchased the same razor at the Art of Shaving for more than twice as much money, I did not feel it necessary to experiment with something else when this razor worked so well.Israeli Personna (Red) blades \u2013 These blades were purchased in a 100 pack at a very reasonable price. I chose them based on the overall reviews and have not been disappointed. I change the blade after four shaves and always get a consistently good shave.Parker silvertip shaving brush \u2013 This is a nice brush and a good value at its price point. It is soft on my skin and lathers Proraso very well. It does not have the backbone of the Simpson\u2019s brushes and as such is now rarely used. I consider this a good starter brush if one is to limit their investment and give wet shaving a chance. With hindsight, I would have saved my money and gone right to the Simpson\u2019s brushes if I were to do it over again. However, there is little to criticize for this brush at this price point.Simpson\u2019s Wee Scot shaving brush \u2013 This brush is really small. It looks like a toy, but don\u2019t be mistaken. It is surprisingly effective with the right soap and is excellent for travel. Be aware that even though this is a best badger brush, it is the scritchiest of all my brushes. Other reviewers have been able to get three passes from loading this brush once. I cannot, and therefore now load for each pass.Simpson\u2019s Classic 2 shaving brush \u2013 This is a superior brush. This best badger brush is not nearly as scritchy as the Wee Scot. It has tremendous backbone and is superb for face lathering. The best badger hair is packed very densely which initially made it tough for the lather to release but with time the lather releases better. Be advised though that unless you live in a very dry climate, this is not an everyday brush as it takes more than 24 hours to dry and therefore must be rotated. Additionally, it will eat tremendous quantities of soap.Simpson\u2019s Chubby 1 shaving brush (super badger) \u2013 This is my best brush. It is similar to the Classic 2 but even more dense with the super badger hair. The handle is slightly wider and bigger all around compared with the Classic 2. Both are good, but you need to like a short handle and be prepared to occasionally get lather on your fingers. Although this is a super badger brush, the degree of softness compared with the best badger Classic 2 is minimal. Compared with the Wee Scot, it is night and day. As with the Classic 2 this brush eats lather due to its density and also takes more than 24 hours to dry.Mitchell\u2019s Wool Fat shaving soap \u2013 This is probably my favorite soap. It is however more difficult to lather. I have found that soaking the puck in tepid water while I shower has vastly improved its latherabilty. Tips for better lathering include not using very hot water, squeezing most of the water out of the brush and then adding only a few drops at a time when needed. The result is the best face feel after the shave of any of the soaps. It provides good cushioning and glide. The scent is minimal and not a factor at all for me.Tabac shaving soap \u2013 I first bought the stick for travel. Unfortunately the Amazon listing showed this as including the case. I only received the refill. Because the Wee Scot brush is so small, I tried lathering directly on the top of the refill stick and was completely satisfied with the results. So satisfied that I then bought the full size puck and bowl. I have since cut the stick into pieces and place it in the travel bowl with a screw down lid that came with the TOBS traditional soap and that is now my travel soap. This soap lather extremely well and is not so sensitive to the water level or have to be rehydrated as does the MWF. The scent is much stronger when lathering but eventually fades. I find the scent to be fine, I don\u2019t have to have it, but don\u2019t object to it at all. My wife likes this scent the best of all of my soaps. It provides good cushioning and glide and is extremely easy to lather. It does not have quite as good a feel after the shave as the MWF, but that is more a statement of how good the MWF is. I do however rotate daily between this and the MWF. They are both that good.Proraso green shaving soap \u2013 I started with this soap and found it good, but nowhere near as good as the MWF or Tabac. It lathers well and is probably the least expensive of any of the soaps that I have used. It provides decent cushioning and glide, but my face feels dryer after shaving than with the MWF and the Tabac.Taylor of Old Bond Street (\u201cTOBS\u201d) Traditional shaving soap \u2013 I was very dissatisfied with this soap. It did not lather with the cheap boar brush, and then I found it did not lather well with any of my other brushes. It did not provide good cushioning or glide and I got the least close shaves with this soap than any other. Given that I can lather MWF, I tend to think it is more the soap than I am the problem. I popped the puck out of the plastic travel case and filled the case with the Tabac stick for my travel needs. The soap was used a bathroom hand soap, because the price was just too high to throw away largely unused.Lucky Tiger aftershave and face balm \u2013 I like this aftershave which is largely witch hazel based with a host of other natural ingredients. There is no alcohol in this product so it does not have the burning bracing effect that some like. It has an orangey citrus scent that goes away after about 30 seconds. This aftershave is very thin and absorbs well. It moisturizes (especially with the MWF) and is a product that feels very clean to me.Other comments:After reading comments from others, I have learned that pill bottles that can be obtained for free from most pharmacies make excellent travel cases for brushes. I drill several holes in the cap for ventilation. I have also used a pill bottle to store the Tabac refill pieces not put in the travel bowl",

I decided it was time to buy a new soap (as if I don't have enough LOL) but didn't want to go crazy with the price so I gave this Proraso green a try. I'm glad I did. It lathers and performs very much like the red version and the scent is really nice. It has a cool menthol feeling that you can feel as soon as you apply it to your face. Very cooling. If you like menthol creams this should be on your list to buy. For the price, it can't be beat.",

Disfruto rasurarme con este jab\u00f3n y lo utilizo junto a su pre-shave. La espuma la genero en el mismo contenedor. Me gusta m\u00e1s las versiones de jab\u00f3n que las de tubo de Proraso. Duran m\u00e1s y generan mayor calidad de espuma.Me proporciona una excelente protecci\u00f3n para rasurarme con el rastrillo Muhlle R41 Grande (open comb) junto con navaja Feather. Esta combinaci\u00f3n del rastrillo y la navaja es de los m\u00e1s agresivo que puedes encontrar en el mercado antes de pasar a una rastrillo de navaja sencilla (o straight razor). Con estas dos \u00faltimas l\u00edneas puedo resumir la excelente calidad del producto. ADVERTENCIA: Solo utilizarlo en d\u00edas calurosos!!! ;-)",
