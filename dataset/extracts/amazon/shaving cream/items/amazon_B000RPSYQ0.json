Its the same scent which they put in some of their cheap deodorant in the late 1980's. It now has an awful scent which stays with you even after you shower. What moron thought this was a good idea?If you look at their reviews on Target.com the marketing department tries to respond to the multitude reviews which despise the new scent...The phoniness of the responses is worse than the scent itself. \"we're sorry you're disappointed...reassure you that we tested this product..\" Um...with whom? No one wants this terrible scent.I literally threw out my new can of Foamy and replaced it with Barbasol.Total morons.",
