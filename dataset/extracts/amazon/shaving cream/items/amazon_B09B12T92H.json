I have a full thick beard that grows quickly , hate to shave but this makes shaving something to look forward to, for 2 reasons. Unlike shaving cream in a can , this comes out of the tube thick and has this luxurious soft, lotion-y feel to it. A little goes a long way and feels great as it goes on. Second, it smells fantastic, not obnoxious like many men's products do although this is aimed at both men and women. I could not find it in a store and not only is it here on Amazon, it is much cheaper than any shaving cream in a tube I saw in stores. I love the feel of this even in my hands and the fragrance is amazing. Makes for a great close shave too and leaves your skin super soft.",
