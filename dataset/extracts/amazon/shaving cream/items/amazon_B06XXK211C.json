                "reviewText": "I have been using shaving soap with brush and bowl for sometime after swapping from Gels and Foam out of a can. It was more adult and ritualistic with different scents and getting the perfect lather but over time I noticed it was drying the skin. This product can be applied from the bowl or straight on from hands to face but does keep my skin smoother during and after the shave. The scent is non offensive and does the job perfectly, especially if you need a moisturiser boost during the shave.",
