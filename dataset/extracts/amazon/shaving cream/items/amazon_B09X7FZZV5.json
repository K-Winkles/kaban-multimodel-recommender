        "description": "Flamingo Foaming Shave Gel is a luxe gel to foam formula that adds a cushion between your skin and razor, giving you a more comfortable shave. Transforms into a pillowy foam creamy enough to stay on wet skin, but light enough to rinse cleanly from razor blades\u2014because shaving in the shower shouldn\u2019t be a race against time. Flamingo Foaming Shave Gel feels good and smells good. Who said shave gel doesn\u2019t deserve a thoughtful scent? We\u2019re leaving fruit punch-y shaving cream fragrances in the past and embracing warm, floral, and spa-like with notes of iris and Sicilian lemon, finished with a hint of suede. Sure, you could just use soap and water, but trust us: our shave gel makes a big difference. Your skin (and razor) will thank you. About Flamingo Flamingo makes body care for women with hair. We've made a collection of high-quality, effective products that start with hair removal. We all have hair in places we want and in places we don't. And removing it shouldn't be complicated.",
