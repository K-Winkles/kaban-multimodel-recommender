This is a quality shave no cream that provides a slick comfortable shave. On the Negative, it's aroma is almost nonexistent. You'll have to try hard to pickup a lime scent. Also the color of the cream is not like pictured in the photos. It's not green. It's almost pure white with a very slight greenish hue. So it comes down to this; the cream will provide a very good shave but that's about it. If the scent of lines is important to you then you'll have to bring your own limes because this cream doesn't have it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product in anticipation of summer and warmer weather, and I'm glad I did.This cream comes in a 200 g (~7 oz) screw-top tub. Upon opening the tub, there is a protective, clear-plastic cover underneath the lid. I assume this is used to better seal and protect the product from leaks. Mine arrived in good condition, with no leaks. When I opened the tub for the first time, I was greeted with a very light, clean soap smell, with a faint lime undertone. For me this is perfect, but if you like a strongly scented shaving cream, you may want to look elsewhere. Also, I should add that this shaving cream doesn't have the same true, freshly-cut lime smell that the rest of the Trumper West Indian Lime products do. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as I find the scent of the shaving cream complements the other Trumper West Indian Lime products very well. The shaving cream itself is light green and slightly shiny. I find it very easy to create a voluminous, dense, luxurious lather with this cream using my Simpsons Commodore X3 best badger shaving brush. The lather itself is slick, very cushioning, and doesn't dry out on my face. My skin feels good post-shave, not overly moisturized or dry. To clarify, my skin is fairly oily and some shaving creams I've used seem to provide too much moisture, leaving my skin feeling oilier than I'd like right after a shave.In my opinion, this is a perfect warmer weather shaving cream that could certainly be used all year. I highly recommend this shaving cream to anyone wanting a lightly-scented, high-quality shave cream.",
