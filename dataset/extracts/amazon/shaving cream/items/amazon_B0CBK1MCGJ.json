He doesn't shave very often, and mostly just trims his beard but uses this more as a lotion. Which is fitting as it looks and smells like a lotion. It definitely moisturizes. I have noticed a difference in the softness of his facial hair and in in his skin. He uses about 3-4 pumps for his face. It does not dispense a lot at one time.",

I tend to get pretty bad razor burn and redness after I shave, and I have tried a number of different products to deal with it. Most do very little to relieve the redness, but this one helped soothe the skin and relieve the burn and rednessThis has the consistency of a lotion. It does take a minute to absorb into the skin, but it is worth it for an effective after shave. The only complaint I have is the bottle doesn't seem designed for this type of thick cream. It comes out with a pump head, but the hole is small so only a tiny amount comes out at a time. This would work better in a jar or squeeze tube",

The balm leaves his face feeling moisturized and silky soft. I liked how his face felt so much that I even stole a little of it for my legs. It is unscented and doesn't cause any irritation. Great product.",

Their only complaint is the style of pump it has. It really is not suited for this style of product because of the thickness. Other than that, it's a very nice balm and they are happy with it.",
