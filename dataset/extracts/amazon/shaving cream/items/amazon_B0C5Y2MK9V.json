                "reviewText": "This shaving cream is pretty awesome! I have been using it on my legs and I love the way it feels!! If you have ever tried regular shaving cream before, it can get a bit messy sicne you can\u2019t easily control how much comes out at a time. And, if you have tried other shaving lotions before, you will usually get a slimy feeling lotion that will stick to the razor and make shaving a little difficult. This shaving cream gets all A\u2019s in my book!!With this shaving cream, I love that I can control how much of the cream I squeeze out of the tube and you really don\u2019t need much to create a huge lather. The lather is not slimy either, making it easy for the razor to move through the cream with ease. I\u2019ve been using this on my legs and every time I\u2019ve gotten a really smooth, close shave without any cuts around the knees or ankles. The scent on this is pleasant but also isn\u2019t very strong so it doesn\u2019t bombard your senses. And it rinses off very easily, leaving my legs feeling smooth into the next day. Definitely a cream I would get again.",

                "reviewText": "I didn\u2019t notice it at first but this isn\u2019t like regular shaving cream or gel. It says it\u2019s meant for thicker coarse hair and trying this on my legs and armpits it is impressive at preventing cuts and nicks. It has eucalyptus and mint so I think that\u2019s what gives the unique cooling effect when you rub it into the skin.",
