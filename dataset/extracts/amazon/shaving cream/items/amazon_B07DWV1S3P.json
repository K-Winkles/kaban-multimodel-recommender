Would love to get back to powder sticks but, this will do until then.",

My wife started getting upset at all the tubes of shave \"gel\" I've given up on after a few shaves. This one makes the cut, no pun intended. Its scent is very light and pleasant. It goes on easily with very little needed, and it is light enough to not clog the razor, even after a few days of not shaving. The only downside is the bottle isn't great for traveling, when space is an issue.",

                "reviewText": "I feel like this guy is the end of a journey for me. A little melodramatic maybe, but it's the truth.I used to use shaving creams because it's what my dad always used, until I found out that shaving foam/gel is broadly superior at having a smooth shave and preventing cuts, at least for me.So I used foams in aerosol cans for a while because that's the form I always found it in at the grocery store. But using aerosol cans for this always struck me as kinda dumb. They always run out within a month, they're hard to get open and rinse before recycling, they're more resource intensive to manufacture and fill in the first place. And it's not like I have to spray the stuff all over my body, it's just my face.So I tried a few bottled gels like this and am never going back. They last forever, give a superior shave, feel better, and are easy to recycle or reuse. This is the best one I've found so far and I'm sticking with it.",

This product while has a great scent does not provide a good glide while shaving. Think of it as a watered-down soap without the glide the soap gives you.I must say I'm a bit let down by it and got several nicks while using but I can't say for sure if it was because of it or not since I was using a new safety razor. It does foam up a bit and it's not completely transparent either but you can tell the region you are shaving way better than regular foam.",
