It also helps a bit with reducing bumps, especially along the neckline.Scent:I didn't detect a scent at all.Consistency:This is a medium thickness cream. This cream works best if you wet your hands, place some of it on one of your palms, then lather in your hands before placing it on your face or body.How long does it last?Unfortunately, based off the size provided, this cream doesn't last very long. I was able to shave my face 8 times per bottle.Would I use this cream again?No. I think it works well, but I prefer other creams (my preferred creams last much longer).3 stars",

                "reviewText": "I got this as I am prone to both irritation and redness after shaving. I recently started used shaving oil which has helped a bit but I was still getting little nicks here and there. When using this I was a little confused of the consistency and how much to use but was able to learn quickly how much to use. Now when shaving I usually shave twice a week with a nice little stubble since my hair grows back fast. I use a razor from Harry's which I find I like for the closeness of the shave. With this I take about a quarter size and add some water not too much and try and get it to lather the trick is not adding too much but not adding enough doesn't get it to apply as nicely. I will say in using this my razor glides over my skin nicely and I have no problems with the formula coming out of my razor say as if you were using a shaving cream. The only thing I don't care for is that since I shave out of the shower since I don't have a step to place my leg on I tend to get the stuff on my floor as I am shaving as I am transitioning to the sink to rinse it's not hard to get up and fairly noticable so you know where to get the stuff up it's just the additonal cleanup is all. Otherwise thou I have gotten a really nice irritation,redness, nicks free shave with this.",
