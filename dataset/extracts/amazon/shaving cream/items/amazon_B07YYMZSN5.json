The directions don't indicate applying water to your face before applying, but that seems to be the better than not doing so. Just apply a small amount of water to your face first and there is a wonderful long lasting moisturizing effect. The fragrance is pleasant and not too strong. For me, this has eliminated the need for an after shave.",

My head may have been spoiled for years by another company that rhymes with Hollar Dave\u2019s Lub. That stuff is a shave butter. This one will get the job down and I will use it as I spent a lot more than I spend on the the other brands but, I will not enjoy it.",
