                "reviewText": "If you are using anywhere but your beard please read!PrefaceThis activity will take a little preparation. Don't just grab this bottle and head all willy nilly into your bathroom. Read the directions. Grab a towel. Prepare your soul.Part I: LogisticsSo....I'm in the shower with the tube. Ok. Now what. Do I apply it dry? But I'm scared to not have access to water if it burns. But water won't let it work. So I can't sit down. Water in my boo tay will wash it off. Ok. I'm going to have to stand. But if I stand...how do I welll....get to everything. Hmm. About 5 position changes later (which is often more than hubs gets) I'm in full on Captain Morgan stance in my shower. Foot on side of tub. Half eagle.Part II: Application.(Refer to preface where you need supplies).Do I slather it with my fingers? Am I supposed to have a spatula? Do I just pour it on there? Have to have some sort of area control because I do not want full on infant nakie parts. Ok. Hands it is.Part III: Application continued.So. Glob on my hand ok. Smells nice. Doesn't smell like an olden days perm or Nair that chars your bits. Ok. Formulations must have come a long way...ok. Applied. Paid attention to the ahem...back too. Don't want any fuzzy parts. Ok. Feels refreshing not too bad.Part IV: TimeSo. Please reference the preface again where you should have read the bottle.So. 1 minute in. Ok. This isn't going to work. Bottle says 4 minutes. 7 if not done in 4. Ok. Got 4 minutes. Why don't I use my toner shampoo and wash my hair? Nothing is happening down there anyways and it takes both 4 minutes. Toning shampoo applied. As I massage my shampoo on my head...we hit about the 2.5 minute markThe refreshing minty sensation is now intensifying. It no longer feels like a fresh coat of cool lotion and now feels like I slapped a wad of vicks straight between my cheeks. Every Vicks nightmare from my childhood rushes back to me. Hurry...rinse your hair. You can't rinse both at the same time or you will burn your eyes and have bald spots on your head. By the time I get the soap out of my hair we are about minute 3. It now feels like I am chewing a Halls Cherry cough drop WITH a Wrigley's spearmint gum after brushing my teeth down there. No freaking way could I make it 7...yes SEVEN minutes as the bottle suggests if 4 minutes doesn't work. Note I read that after the fact. It also took about 5 Captains Morgan leg switch stances to prayerfully air out in between.Part V: RinsingAgain. Please see preface where you need supplies. So I shoot my hands down there to start to frantically rinse my junk. After the fact, I noted a towel should be used. For the love of all things sacred no matter how bad it burns....do NOT scratch! As soft as possible rub. Here is where the towel would have been so so nice. *insert addendum.. make sure your water is not hot. A nice cool rinse would have been a nice touch also*So I resume panicky grabbing water from the shower to lob onto my stuff to get that mess off. Minute 5 is about now. I see little pieces of hair coming off but not much.Part VI:Results. Well. Let's just say I hope my husband is super tired when he gets home from work. I look like a speckled owl stung by a bee. I mean the parts it worked on are smooth. The other parts...not so much. The tube says wait at least 24 hours before attempting again. Yes sir. How about 72. I'm not doing that again until it doesn't feel like I have an Altoid in there. I'm the pantone swatch of naked raw chicken so can't really hide anything.Part VII-EpilogueThe product itself isn't bad. I believe maybe it was user error. I should have probably exfoliated, read the bottle, and planned. If I was perfectly ready and applied evenly it would have worked. I mean parts did. \ud83d\ude2c",

                "reviewText": "I only use this product on my neck, as any time I shave or pluck my neck, I break out in a mass of bumps that last for weeks\u2014and once I shave again, they are back.Since I\u2019ve been using the magic shave cream, I haven\u2019t had any mass of razor bumps or ingrown hair bumps.However, this stuff does burn my neck and takes a few days to heal. Luckily, it heals much faster than if I were to shave or pluck the hairs there instead.It says to do 4 minutes, which never works for me. On the back, it says if you must then do 5-7, which ends up burning the skin but also getting the hair.Overall, it\u2019s a dual-edged blade that I\u2019d recommend trying\u2014especially if you experience pseudofollucitis barbae, which I believe I may have.P.S. It smells awful. I only use it once a week, and it\u2019s right before showering.",

                "reviewText": "I was really hoping this product would work for me. I hate shaving, but my wife hates facial hair so I was hoping this would work and keep me smooth for a few days between applications but it was a total letdown. As a 44 year old man who grows facial hair about as well as a middle schooler, I thought this product would be awesome for me... Boy was I wrong! My thoughts and experience with it below:The product when in the tube smells pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised by the scent. I tested on a small patch of beard over the weekend. Didn't work great, but didn't irritate my skin, so I figured I just didn't use enough, or needed to leave it on a bit longer.Monday night rolls around and I went for it. I slathered a bunch of cream all over my face and neck, and set a timer on my phone for 4 minutes. The first few minutes kind of felt nice. Almost like a cooling gel or something. The next 2 minutes or so had a slight burn - not terrible, but not as nice as earlier. At the 4 minute mark, it's starting to stink a bit. I test wipe with a cool, damp washcloth where I first applied, and almost nothing comes off. I set the timer for another 3 minutes to get me up to 7 minutes total. The timer goes off and I start wiping. Maybe 50% of my facial hair comes off. I wipe a bit firmer and a little more comes off. I try rubbing hard, and nothing else comes off, but it feels like I'm giving myself rug burn in the spot I rubbed hard.At this point, I give up and rinse my face with cool water. Now I have this patchy mess all over my face and neck, and my face STINKS. Like 'flaming bag of dog poo' stinks. I try to rinse some more and nothing else comes off, and the stink is still going strong. Also now my cheeks and a lot of my face feel like they have rug burn. I let everything dry and put some aloe lotion on my face. A few more applications of lotion over the course of a couple hours and the stink is still there but not as bad, and the rug burn feel is a bit better.Tuesday morning, I wake up and have to shave with a razor, or else I'm going to work looking like some dollar store werewolf with patchy hair everywhere. My face still feels like it's rug burned but at least I'm smooth (thanks to my razor) and only a hint of flaming poo smell, so there's that.Less than 24hr later and my stubble has returned exactly like it would if I had just shaved with a normal razor, and I still feel a slight rug burn sensation. Not only did this product not initially do what it claimed, but it didn't make it one day of being smooth, much less 4!I can't recommend strongly enough that you avoid this product. Maybe it works for some folks based on the reviews, but all in all it was a terrible experience for me, and I don't see where it really saves any time versus just shaving with a razor.",
