                "reviewText": "First I have to say that I could not get this cream to foam (see update below). I read reviews from other who couldn't either, so my suggestion is if foam is important to you, this may not be for you. The consistency was more of a cross between a shave cream and butter. That was a huge ding for me...but even with that I could not ignore the performance. So on to the performance...I have been wet shaving for about 3 years and have tried a variety of soaps, creams and butters. From the more pricy like AOS to the budget friendly Proraso. Some were ok and others were great. But Bevel is supreme in my opinion. My face never felt more moisturized and soft after the shave, which surprised me due to the lack of foam. As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't get it to foam and was worried that the cream was drying out and would provide a painful shave. That absolutely was not the case. I was using the Bevel DE razor so the combination of the two worked perfectly. In the end, as I rinsed by face/head, my skin felt very smooth and barely felt the need for aftershave. But I'm glad that I did follow up with the Bevel aftershave balm, first time using both, because that was the icing on the cake. I completed my shave with a great experience. I guess I'm becoming a wet shave hobbyist, a term that I thought was ridiculous when I first heard of it but here I am.The other ding I give it is the scent. One if the joys I get from wet shaving is the scents of the various soaps/creams/butters. This has a very light almost nonexistent scent. That being said, the performance outweighed all of my negatives by far. But it would be perfect if there were different scents and more foam, in my opinion. Nevertheless, providing a bump free smooth shave is far more important and that's where Bevel delivers. So far, I am impressed with every Bevel product that I have used.Update regarding the lather: I read reviews for their shave brush and some complained that is was a small brush. Immediately I thought that was the key to getting the cream to foam as my shave brushes are a little long. I think I was right. I purchased their brush and now I'm getting a decent lather. I still can't create a fully cloud of foam like some other soaps, but it's no longer like a butter and good enough to remove that complaint.",

Now we'll see if it prevents razor bumps from amassing...something my other cream did not help with.",
