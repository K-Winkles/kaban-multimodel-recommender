The combination of oils and butters are a good blend where it feels soft on your skin. She so far has no complaints about using it but says it's better than the generic stuff she got from the store recently which made her skin feel dry. This kept her skin moisturized and didn't cause a break out or any reactions. So far works for her. I do warn though, just because the oils work for her, sometimes not so much for others. It's a good product for her, but it may not be for someone else.",

If you love that scent, this is almost an exact dupe! If you don't like it or have reacted to it, I'd steer clear. Scent aside, EOS shave creams are thick, moisturizing, and effective, and this one is no different. I didn't deal with any razor burn and my legs still feel soft days later.",

It was a bit more gentle and thicker than the store bought shave cream but it definitely didn't help reduce the number of razor burns I got, especially in the bikini line area.

I have used a few brands of shave butter over the years though that I really liked and preferred to basic shaving cream/foam. This eos Cashmere Skin Collection Vanilla Cashmere Scented Shave Butter is not one that I like very much or even prefer to my regular cheap shaving cream. There are a few reasons for this.Cons: It did not stop/improve any irritation or razor bumps. I generally only experience irritation when shaving around my bikini line (I do my best as time allows to exfoliate before and after, apply shaving cream/butter liberally, shave gently and slowly in the right direction, etc. but either way I always end up with some sort of irritation). I was hopeful that this eos shave butter would perform better and lessen the irritation I experience, but it was the same experience as always.- In the bathtub it balls up into little chunks when I go to rinse it that float around in the water. It has a hydrophobic quality to it that I assume causes it which grosses me out.-I also found that the hydrophobic quality which causes the non-foam production makes it feel less pleasant and gives a drier shave. With other shave butters I have been able to add a few drops of water to have it go further and allow the razor to glide more smoothly. I found that the razor did not glide as smoothly. As a result I noticed that I am not able to get as much of a close shave.-The Yuka app ( which allows you to scan products and its scoring system analyzes each ingredient for health or environmental impact) which I have come to depend on to see through the natural claims/fancy marketing of some companies gives this a score of only 7/100 due to several concerning ingredients.Pros: I love the strong smell of cocoa butter that this shave butter brings to the table. It smells great! It does make my skin feel slightly smoother and smell pleasant, but the results are not dramatic. Other than the pleasant smell, I found it unpleasant to use for the reasons listed above.",

It also looks like it too, so hard as it is, resist the urge to taste it. lolIt's thick and I probably could have used a lot less. No problems shaving with it, in fact, I have a couple of bumps under one armpit and had no issues with irritation. I seriously love this stuff!",
