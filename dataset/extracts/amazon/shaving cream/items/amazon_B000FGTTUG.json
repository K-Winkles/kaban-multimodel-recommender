                "reviewText": "Yes one word to describe this product \"WOW\"! All my life I have shaved with some form of goop from a can called \"Shaving Gel\". My friend, you know nothing of shaving until you actually break out a Badger Brush and lather your own \"Shaving Cream\" and spread it on your face. It felt nice and heavy and so smooth on my face with just a little bit of cream I was able to form Shaving Cream Nirvana! Hands down it was the best shave of my life!Normally when I use the goop I am only able to get maybe one pass with my Mach III razor, as I have very sensitive skin. Then I try and go over the ruff spots but not too much as it starts hurting. I was able to get not one, not two, but three passes with this cream and my Mach III. Normally my skin is red, bumpy and irritated and probably bleeding if I dare try for just 2 passes with the old goop, but not the case with this quality cream. Yes this stuff works, and it was worth every penny. Even my wife was impressed on how close of a shave I had.Now I am still learning this whole wet shaving technique as this was my first go around. But from what I have learned from Badger & Blade, and Manic59 all found on google I am never going back to the goop. Later this week my Double Edge Razor will be my in my hand and my hopes, are it will be just as great of an experience. If so my Mach III will be bouncing off the rim of my trash can as did my almost full can of \"Shaving Gel\" aka the goop.One last thought is take my words with a grain of salt. This was the first go I have ever had at a wet shave, I may have had just as wonderful of a shave with a soap or some other cream. The person that told me to try this out also has sensitive skin and said this is the best stuff. I also heard the same story from others listing off multiple brands of products. But if you are looking to make a change from goop to a real Shaving Cream you will not, and I mean WILL NOT be disappointed. I love this stuff, but it begs the question, if this cream is this good, what else is out there to shave with that maybe even better?",

                "reviewText": "I shave my both my face and whole head, so I wanted some decent products to do so comfortably. I started off with e-shave, which I did like but it was expensive so I thought I would try some other \"upscale\" shave products of similar price to see if there were any I liked better. I tried the Musgo Real from Portugal as it had such rave reviews and was pretty disappointed (skip it). Did not like the scent and it was not a rich a cream as e-shave. I am not one of those guys who is obsessed with getting a \"BBS\" (baby butt smooth) shave, but I do want something that is good quality.I tried the Art of Shave (first a trial size of the Sandalwood scent which I did not like the smell) then went with the unscented larger size as the cream itself seemed good.My thoughts are:Pros:- No discernible scent- Nice thick lather- Need a very small amount for good coverage- Provides a very smooth, comfortable shave- Rinses clean away with no scent or residue on your skinCons:- Kinda pricy, but so were the other options.Overall, this is a really good shaving cream and I am equally happy with it as I am with the e-Shave.NOTE: Do not bother with the Pre-Shave Oil. It does not add much to the shave quality, does have a scent (even the unscented version), and leaves a goopy residue.Hope you found this helpful!",

Ayant la peau sensible, c'est le premier produit de rasage qui ne me provoque aucune (ou presque aucune) irritation. Il n'y a pas d'odeur ce que je trouve \u00e9galement agr\u00e9able. Le seul inconv\u00e9nient est que, \u00e9tant Suisse, je dois faire venir le produit des US, mais cela ne pose plus de probl\u00e8me avec Amazon et ses moyens d'approvisionnement efficaces :)Je conseille d'utiliser ce produit avec un blaireau. J'ai fait derni\u00e8rement l'acquisition du blaireau suivant (lien: Edwin Jagger - 1EJ946SDS - Blaireau traditionnel anglais - Imitation \u00e9b\u00e8ne - Support - Noir - Taille M ). Il fait son travail \u00e0 merveille et perd peu de poils.Achetez cette cr\u00e8me \u00e0 raser les yeux ferm\u00e9s, vous aurez pour votre argent: 1 pot par ann\u00e9e en se rasant 4-5x par semaine!",
