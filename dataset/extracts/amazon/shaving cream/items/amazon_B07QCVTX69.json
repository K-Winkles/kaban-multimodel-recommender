This is a good product and goes a long way, I will purchase again.Initial Review:I began using this product on May 2nd and find the gel to meet or exceed my expectations so one might wonder why not a five star review. The gel gets a five it is the dispensing container that gets a three star and may become a one star and this is the reason.The container is 7 ounces in size (198 grams) and contains a rather large push-button at the top. The first time I pressed to dispense the gel, the quantity that came out was sufficient for two shaves hence it was so fast that it was literally surprising. The next several days I was able to reduce the flow rate by tapping the button quickly (not easy to do it is quite stiff) but not quick enough to get less than about 1 1/2 of what is needed to shave.It is possible that because the can is full of product and propellant that this may slow down as it is used and I can live with that because the gel meets my needs. However if this control issue continues and is also an issue with the other two containers in the three pack I purchased I will have no choice but to drop the review to a one and purchase from another company.",
