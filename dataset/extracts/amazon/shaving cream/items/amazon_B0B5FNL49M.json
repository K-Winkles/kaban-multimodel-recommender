I have super sensitive sin and really fine body hair so it can be tough to get a decent shave. I have both the SE and Pro razors (prefer the Pro), and have tried the shave cream and post-shave, and use a shave brush from them as well to lather up the cream. All their products are really great. Everything is super high quality. If you're used to shaving cream squirting out of a pressurized can, there's a little bit of a learning curve with this \"old school\" kind of shaving, but it's really worth the effort. My legs are silky smooth with absolutely no irritation. I highly, HIGHLY recommend every one of their products.",

I had a gilette shaving cream for my little 'baby's first shaving set', complete with disposable razors, and boy did my skin not like it. And that was before I started shaving! Of course, I might have a really skewed perspective, but I can swear this supply shaving cream makes it LEAGUES better.I might not have years of experience with shaving, but before I started using Gilette Skinguard, I was using a supply razor for quite some time, so I can say with some confidence that it was the shaving cream that made my first experiences with wet shaves that slightest bit worse.When I use this, even if I've somehow cutting myself left and right, it doesn't cause that unpleasant tingling sensation that cheap shaving cream causes. Again, I do have a little experience now, but just remember:I'm BIASED as FRICK for this",

                "reviewText": "I just received my \"tin\" of shaving cream this week and tried it last night. Upon opening the tin, there is a very pleasant, unique, masculine scent that I like very much. It was not overpowering at all. I could see some air pockets inside the container, but it looks like a full tin of product. I did not use a brush to apply, only a small amount that covers the index finger up to the first crease line. It lathered effectively enough to give me a decent layer on my face/neck. If you use a brush, you might only need half of the amount I used on your brush. It is hard to say how long this should last me as I only shave every 2+ days or so, but it feels like I will definitely get my money's worth before needing a new tin. So far, I am glad I gave Supply a try.",

For the last 56 years, I have been using whatever is at Walmart. I bought a German Straight Razer and it feels great. I bought a brush and started using this saving cream and just made shaving fun again.",
