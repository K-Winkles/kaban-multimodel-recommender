My only gripe, and its a big one, is that the scent in all three is extremely weak. In addition to being weak, the Sandalwood scent bears no resemblance to sandalwood. The other two scents are more accurate, but they're all extremely weak. They should spend an extra 15 cents on each container for more scented oil. Add a dollar to the price for three containers and everybody wins.Shaving is a chore. I buy products to make the chore more fun and enjoyable. Without a great scent, shaving is just a chore with this cream. Will not buy again.",

I tried sandalwood. Nice. The cream is smooth and it has a perfect density for applying on wet skin. The scent is nice, mild... It washes off nicely, without leaving any coating on skin, which also means you don't have to wash off razors thoroughly to get it off. The value is great. Those 3.5 oz shall last. However, it is still a risk to blind buy since all skin types are different. For me it's 5 out of 5. I tried many brands in the past \"Gentlemen's Refinery\", \"Harry's\", Di Parma (unscented), etc. This product is on the level.",

                "reviewText": "As a mug & brush user for over sixty years, I've read of shavers who rubbed the shaving soap on their beards and then used the brush to build lather. It never appealed to me. Now, however, with this shaving cream, it works.You can't whip up a lather in the container. Instead, I wet my beard then use the wet brush to distribute the shaving cream all over my beard. I constantly add water to the brush to build a very good lather.More important, my 1972 Persona dual-blade razor works very comfortably with the lather for a close, irritation-free shave. My skin feels moister and, adding the Viking after-shave balm to my face completes the comfort. (I've stayed with the twin blade after reading and experiencing that the first blade sets up the whiskers and the second one cuts. Additional blades do nothing more than scrape the already whisker-free skin.)",
