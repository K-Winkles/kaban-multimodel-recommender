                "reviewText": "I'm a big fan of other Herban Cowboy products (the after shave balm, soap, etc.) and as such I had to give this shave cream a try. I will say first off that I highly recommend using this product with a shave brush as you will really get the most out of it this way. I've been shaving with a DE safety razor for years and have tried many different shave soaps and creams and this is definitely one of my favorites.The bottle states that it is non-lathering, which is true, so if you come from using Barbasol or Gilette or any other garbage from a can, you may be a bit surprised. However, it is extremely creamy and with a shave brush you will get an excellent, foamy coating on your face. As far as shaving, this cream does an excellent job of raising the hairs and stiffening them to make your razor glide through for a very close shave. The scent is the brand's signature \"Dusk\" smell, which is not for everyone, but I personally love it and it is not overpowering. This product also has menthol crystals (which you don't see or feel) that make your face feel cool and tingly when you apply it which increases the shaving comfort and is very refreshing overall. I also appreciate the fact that because I have very sensitive skin this shave cream is nice and soothing and has zero irritating ingredients.Overall, it's a great product and one tube will go a long way if you utilize a shave brush as you can use very little product while yielding lots of creamy foam. I use this in conjunction with the after shave balm and it's as refreshing as shaving has ever been for me. Oh, and you can't beat the fact that it is all natural and 100% vegan - no junk in this tube.5/5",

I continued using several shave soaps but this shaving cream is so much better and at a competitive price. It lathers nicely and I have noticed that, compared to any soap I\u2019ve tried over the years, it creates a protective and slippery surface against nicks. The scent is masculine, fresh and refined - similar to $40 French shaving creams sold at department stores, like \u00e0 l\u2019Occitane.",

                "reviewText": "I have used practically every natural shave cream you can name - Aubrey has produced one for years that I used to shave with regularly - and I've tried a few others, but none compares to this. Why? It actually has a good, thick paste and a clean feel and good smell. The Aubrey product feels very oily. Others do not lather up well. This one does. It goes on smooth, thick, and leaves your face feeling well served and not oily. Obviously, forget the canned shave creams and others of that like. This one is both affordable and pleasant to use. If I have one quibble - it seems to run out a little fast. It may be I'm using too much, at times, but I wish it had more than 6.7 ounces. They can go to a bigger size easily. All in all, the ingredients listed point to a good product with good ingredients and I would rate this shave cream #1 among all the others I've tried. I like many of their products as well and use them regularly - their Wild deodorant and their cologne. Both excellent value. Both excellent products.",

It makes a thick, fine lather that keeps it's fullness during the whole shave. I'ts very mild and non-irritating. It doesn't leave any slick residue after a pass with the razor, yet it provides great slickness. Mild, unassuming fragrance.I've used several high-end brands' shave creams and soaps, and this is as-good or better than any of them. It's also far better than any brand that can be purchased in any grocery store or \"health\" store. Most of those main stream and \"all-natural\" brands are not very good.I don't care that this is \"all-natural\". It gives me the best shave.",

                "reviewText": "I'll be clear from the outset, this is not a shave cream that is ever going to be mistaken for shave soap. It's obviously designed to simply apply with your hands.With that said, as you can see from my photos, not only can this be lathered with a shave brush, it goes a very, very long way.I used two almonds worth of cream and lathered for 2 minutes. In my photos, I was able to get three applications out of that AND the final picture of my brush was what was left AFTER those three passes.So, if you read other reviews claiming this can't be lathered, or that it's a thin cream, that's just nonsense.The smell of this cream is masculine but it doesn't really smell like anything I can really point out. It's just masculine in a musky type of way. Also, there is a slight cooling sensation.In use, this is slick but not overly so. It's definitely enough to get the job done. I used Feather blades in a Merkur Future on 6 and experienced NO sensitive skin after use. Considering I have very sensitive skin and that's extremely aggressive in shave setting, this cream will get the job done for you.I'm hard on shaving supplies. If it's not darn near perfect, I won't use it. However, while I'm still partial to shave soap, I can tell you this will now consistently be in my cabinet. 5 starsCheers!",
