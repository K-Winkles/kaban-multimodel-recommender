When I ran out, I tried some shaving soap and a shaving brush and bowl, and it really made me appreciate this product. The edge shave gel is just so much thicker and richer and sticks better and protects better, the other stuff I got razor bumps, it didn\u2019t stick to my skin, one pass and it was basically gone. I\u2019ve tried other stuff in the past as well like regular canned shaving cream and other gels, but this for me is superior in every way and one of the only ones that practically eliminates razor bumps. There may be something better out there, but this is the best I\u2019ve found in my 25+ years of shaving and what I\u2019ll compare anything else to if I do decide to try something different just to change it up.",
