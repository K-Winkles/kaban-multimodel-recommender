It's concentrated against your skin, not in a cloud that gets scraped down the drain. Cremo contains unique molecules that become impossibly slick when mixed with water, so your blade can glide effortlessly over skin. You'll enjoy a clean, comfortable shave and astonishingly smooth skin while fighting nicks, razor burn and irritation.",

I'm not sure about the \"activates with water\" claim. Don't they all? I mean, have you ever tried to put Barbasol on a dry face?Still though, love the product. Love the scents. Just a tad pricey.",

                "reviewText": "It has a nice scent. Very slippery stuff for a good shave. There's only one thing I don't like. The tube says to use an \"almond size\" amount for a shave. The Cremo doesn't lather up very well so an \"almond\" amount leaves just a thin film on the the face that is hard to even see. I ended up using 2 \"almonds\" and that worked better. The tube says it will last 3 months but it was more like six weeks for me.",

                "reviewText": "I switched to Cremo brand years ago because I absolutely hated foaming shaving creams in aluminum cans. They rust, you get way too much product, and I felt like it was effecting my ability to get all the hair as close to the skin as possible.This stuff just needs a bit of water and it spreads across your skin in a nice layer. It also leaves my skin moisturized, and I can really tell around my armpits that the level of moisture helps reduce any necessary after care for ingrown hairs or razor burn.This scent in particular is my absolute favorite. It's slightly masculine, but I think it is also subtle enough that ladies can wear it as well without smelling like full on dude. I've tried all scents in store except lavender, and that's mostly because I dislike the scent of lavender.Over-all, I would highly recommend to any person needing shaving cream for whatever reason.",

                "reviewText": "Smells amazing, lathers up fast, very slick...good lubricity. The lather is not very rich though and the bubbles in the foam are big and loose and don't offer much cushion. If you are accustomed to a rich thick lather like you get from a premium milled shave soap then this might not be for you. However, this lathers up with much less effort, is less messy, and a lot more slick. So if you like more glide and don't mind less cushion this is good stuff a little goes a long way too so this 2 pack will last me a while. I mostly bought it because I had the Cremo body wash of the same scent, but after using it a month I like it a lot even though it's z little different than the Crabtree and Evelyn or Colonel Conk shave soaps I am used to. For a real treat try what some call uber-lather by mixing shave soap, shave cream, and a few drops of vegetable glycerine. Best of all worlds in one shave.",
