I can't really comment on how it is for sensitive skin or moisturizing because when I've finished scraping with the razor the condition of my skin entirely depends on whether the razor is sharp or dull (I use the same razor until it begins cutting me). I've never noticed whether moisturizing makes any difference with either foam or gel. The bottom line is that I end up with a good close shave, and I'm completely satisfied with this gel.",

                "reviewText": "I give a major thumbs up to Gillette Series Shave Gel with Aloe for Sensitive Skin. I was already a Gillette fan prior to getting a free can of shave gel to try and review. I have very sensitive skin--even cashmere scarves leave a red line around my neck in the winter--so I am always looking for the next best thing in shave gear. The Gillette Series Shave Gel for sensitive skin gave a very nice, close shave. In addition, my sensitive skin was not the least bit red or raw afterwards. I tried the shave gel with and without the pre-shave oil I typically use; I also stuck to my normal routine of first shaving with the grain before going over my face once more to hit the problem areas (I'm one of those people who grows facial hair fast, and I have a tendency toward \"five o'clock shadow\" by noon!). The brand boasts a triple action formula, which I believe refers to the fact that the shaving gel contains lubricants to help protect the skin from irritation, hydrating ingredients to soften the whiskers, and infused aloe to soothe and refresh the skin post-shave. The shave gel also has a pleasant, mild scent--not too strong and not too perfumey, just fresh. See my before-shave and after-shave photos. I have already bought another can.https://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Sensitive-Skin-Shave-Gel-7/dp/B00J5IZUJO/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1467062179&sr=1-2&keywords=gillette+series+shave+gel",
