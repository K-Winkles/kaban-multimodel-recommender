I had hoped to find a truly superior razor system. This one is by far the best razor I've used. I didn't rate it 5 stars because it is ridiculously expensive. That seems to be Gillette's way with every iteration of their Multi-Blade systems. This blade gives a very close shave with hardly any nicks or cuts. That's the kicker for me. I have really sensitive skin, and I like a very close shave. I've been using this razor for a couple of weeks, and I've only nicked myself twice. Previously, I had to use my Nick-Stick after every shave. So, I give the Gillette Labs razor 4 stars. I just wish they weren't so expensive.",
