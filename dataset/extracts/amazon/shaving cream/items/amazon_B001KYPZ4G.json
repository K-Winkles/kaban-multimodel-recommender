                "reviewText": "**Update** I've been using this for a few months now, and it is still as awesome as the first use. The biggest change is that I now use a latex glove to apply the goop to my skin and wash it off, mainly because my nails are brittle and I don't know if this was making it worse or it was a coincidence. It's still awesome, but I've given up using it on anything but my legs. The face isn't a problem anymore, and the downstairs is just too annoying to use more than for special occasions because I need help to be as smooth as I get from shaving, and it doesn't last long enough to make it worth the effort.**Original review**If you're reading this, you're skeptical. Over 50k reviews on one product, and most people give it 5 stars, so you want to know what's the catch. There's no way something this magical can come out of a silly pink bottle, and the hair removal Venn diagram overlap between easy, fast, and cheap is a unicorn that takes you to Hogwarts to meet Aragorn and save the Black Pearl.Let me tell you, Aragorn is taller than I expected.I originally bought this for my older (teenage) daughter. She has horribly sensitive skin, and gets the worst razor burn from shaving her legs. But we live on the face of the sun, so shorts are required to not die for the 11.5 months of summer, and life can get rough. I did a bunch of research on options for her, and everything I read online had this product at the top of the list. I had a run in with Nair long ago and still have a scar from the chemical burn during the patch test on my leg, so was extremely hesitant, but I decided to give in to her begging and let her give it a try after reading so many positive reviews.She looked like a naked mole rat, but the happiest one ever because after slathering the cream on and waiting 8 minutes, her legs were completely smooth and no razor burn! It was amazing! A happy teenager does exist!Her results got me thinking, and I decided to give it a shot myself. My test patch was MUCH smaller than the swath of leg the daughter used, but 10 minutes later, no more and no less, the hair came off. Mostly. But my hair is much more thick and dark from years of shaving, though my lower legs are usually epilated so the hair doesn't grow quick as thick. I figured it was at least a good jump on epilating, so went ahead and did as the Johnny Cash song states, doing one part at a time. I was paranoid about getting burned, so did my lower legs one at a time, then each upper leg. By then, I was feeling bullet proof. Two (mostly) smooth legs, no burns, and no issues? Bring on the bikini area. But I had read the reviews, and I wanted to be smooth aallll over, so to hell with it, I did it all. ALL.It didn't work quite as well in the netherworld as on my legs, but the hair is also much thicker. I then jumped in the shower to wash the magical fairy snot of the gods from my skin, and lo, angels began singing as I started scrubbing. I have an exfoliating mitt that I keep my bar of soap in, and as I lathered on the soap, the remaining hair on my legs vanished. It was still patchy down below, but nothing a quick swipe with a razor couldn't fix.Now dried, I looked in the mirror. Bulletproof? Nay, I was Achilles, and nothing could harm me, including a smear of miracle goo on a few problem areas on my face. However, I am a careful Greek hero, so I only set the timer for 4 minutes. That was all it took for my face to be perfectly smooth and the fine but dark and obvious hairs to be gone. To top it off, my dry and flaky self was neither dry nor flaky! I used only a tiny bit of coconut oil, rather than the copious amounts my skin usually absorbs to be soft and touchable.We both smeared on a good amount of the cream where we wanted the hair to be gone, using our hands and washing them immediately. And by good amount, I mean you don't want to see hair stubble. It's $10, so don't be stingy. Then wait your time, using a timer, and scrape it off with the plastic thing, going against the hair. Be careful with areas that have folds or creases, because letting them touch will mess up the layer of goop and give you bad results. I'm 100% sure my less than stellar outcome below was due to not being careful to keep creases and folds from creasing and folding, so I plan to give it another shot in a few days. My husband likes how my skin feels after using Veet, so maybe I can get a helping hand next time....bow chicka wow wow...",

I leave on for 8-10mn then use the scraper to remove and follow with water, soap and I use a towel to rub dry since some of the hairs don\u2019t break off with the scraper tool. Lotion at the end and I have dolphin-smooth legs!!! Happy customer!!",

Well it did work but i would NOT recommend to do it. It did burn and it left a red mark. On the other hand, i also used it for my underarms and it did work and felt smoother than shaving. After a couple of times i was able to remove all the hair. i still expected the product to smell better or at least different bc of the way they advertised it on the bottle (if that makes sense). it\u2019s an okay alternative",

I have used this product twice now and i love it. quick and easy 11/10 recommend!",

Firstly, I might say that it smells really good.It works, but still leaves the strawberry legs like with those little dots, it takes away all the hair, though.It brings up like a little spatula, made to apply and take away the product.I\u2019ve used it in my armpits, and I would give it a rate of 7 out of 10 because it actually works very good on there.I hope this is helpful for you and that it works out\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

It\u2019s literally magic.I will say, once you sit with it on and it\u2019s time to take off, you have to use the scraper it comes with to literally \u201cscrape\u201d the hair off of yourself. it won\u2019t just brush off. That\u2019s where it gets a little hard on my skin, but the actual formula is great.Make sure you don\u2019t keep it on too long! 8 minutes is perfect for stubborn and thick hair!!!If you keep it on too long you will get red spots. You\u2019ve been warned!!! Now buy this and never shave again!!!!!",
