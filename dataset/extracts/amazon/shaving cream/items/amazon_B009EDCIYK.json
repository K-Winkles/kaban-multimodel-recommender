The original and spiced citrus scents are great. The lather and slick glide of the razor is hard to beat. I know shaving products and scents are an individual preference. I am just here to say I love this stuff! If you are reading this and curious, order it now! You won't be disappointed.",

Just a pinch at the bottom of the tube will give you enough to lather on your face. The scent (I use Spiced Citrus) is subtle and sweet, and the formula has plenty of moisturizers. Not only does my razor glides while it shaves, but with just a flick of the wrist under the shower stream, my razor is clean (I use a Gillette Pro-Glide). The biggest surprise was when I brought my hand up to feel my face-- my shave was so close my hand literally (and I do mean literally) squeaked against my face! The last time my shave was this close I was 16, and I had only two chin hairs back then!To be truthful, I hesitated over the price, but those concerns went away after my first shave. To steal a popular tag line-- you're worth it, and Musgo is definitely worth the money! You cannot get a better shave.",

My only gripe is that for the price I was expecting the spiced citrus to really be a significant scent that made this stand apart. Honestly it has a nice soap smell thats fresh but I get hardly any citrus or spice from it. Overall its a high quality product but for 24 dollars its a bit too much for me to buy regularly especially when it basically just smells like any fresh soap.",

It lathers up easily, it \"slicks\" my face nicely for the razor, and the spiced citrus scent is fantastic! Also, it only takes a small amount. I'd read on Badger & Blade to use an almond sized amount. That was plenty for me to get a good four pass shave. Also, there are a LOT of \"almond size amounts\" in a tube.Also, about the scent. It is very nice without at all being overbearing. You'll catch a whiff from time-to-time, but it doesn't hang over you.Bottom line: Worth every penny!",

You don't have to use a lot for a good morning's shave worth lather.

I recommend use of an old-fashioned double-edge (DE) safety razor and quality blade from Gillette or Wilkinson Sword.",
