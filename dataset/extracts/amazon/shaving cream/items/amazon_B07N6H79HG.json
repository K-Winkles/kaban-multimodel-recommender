I use it to shave my head, not my face. With only having to use such a small amount of cream, I expect to get 6+ months use out of this tin. As far as the scent goes, you only get the barbershop scent in the tin. After I whip up a lather and apply it to my head, I really don't smell the scent, but that doesn't take away that this is a fantastic shaving cream. I'll check out the sandalwood scent the next time I need to buy one!",

I had opened the container and there was a fairly decent amount of the product missing. I'm unsure if it was a leakage or if they intentionally leave large air bubbles within the product. Seeing the product is upwords of $16 per tin I felt cheated.I had emailed the company immediately through their business card that came with, and they've offered to replace it and I may keep the initial tin as a courtesy.Trying the product itself, I have quite sensitive skin. I almost dread going to the barbershop every two weeks because whatever product they use it ALWAYS irritates my skin. This has been a life-saver! I've had zero issues shaving with this brand of shaving cream, would 100% recommend it to my other sensitive skinned brothers and sisters. While having reduced product from the first tin as a negative, if customer service and quality remain this well; I have no issue staying a life-long consumer!",

If you use your imagination, you can vaguely smell powder. If you really want that \u201cold time barbershop\u201d smell, try Mama Bear\u2019s Old Time Barbershop. Growing up in an ethnic neighborhood in St. Louis, I remember that smell. It brings back nice memories, and Mama Bear got it spot on. Still, Rocky Mountain produces some good products, too. This one just needs a little work.",

Itcomes with the lid filled with the shaving cream, ( probably because of the shipping process ). Youcan spoon it back into the container. One thing is for certain, it will go a long way. I used a brushand a small amount on the end of the brush is well enough for a good shave.It stays moist and keeps your whiskers soft throughout the shave. Rinses clean and leaves your facewithout irritation. The only thing that I find that I am not satisfied with is, the price is a little muchfor a can of shaving cream. I imagined the can would be a little bigger. However, the descriptiondid mention the ounces. ( MY FAULT ). Other than that, it's a fine smelling and good shaving cream,for a comfortable shave...",

I prefer brush shaves, and over the years have tried multiple products, soaps, foams, gels, creams..etc, and i can say with confidence that this cream is the best i have ever used. I put a small amount on a damp brush( i am using the term damp lightly) and it was plenty, i could have shaved my face twice with the coverage a little bit produces. They also nail the the \"barbershop scent\" This will be my staple as long as i shave! I used it with a modern 5 bladed razor, but with the excellent sheerness and thickness, i will be dusting off my safety razor when i have time to enjoy the shave! I am hooked!",
