                "reviewText": "This shave conditioner is different from what I'm used to. I used it alone and then in combinatiin with more traditional shave creams like proaso and taylor of bond st. I like it either way. The jar says to rub in the leftover cream when done shaving. I did this when using this oroduct by itself nit when in combination with the other creams. I must say I was impressed by how smooth my skin was post shave. I still need to figure out how \"thick\" to apply. I did find this conditioner to clog up my merkur razor a little bit. I think by thinning it out a bit that it wouldn't be too much an issue. I would definitely buy this again, for personal use though, I bet this tub will last a long time. The scent is not a traditional shaving cream like aroma. More like a tropical type scent. I'm from the midwest and I imagine this is what a barber shop would smell like in florida lol. Buy it. At $10 you can't lose.",

Again, I\u2019m new. Dipping a brush in water and mixing with Stephens in a bowl makes the lather much thinner and easier to apply thus easier to shave off. That said, Stephens is affordable and smells nice. Made with cocoa butter, gives it a coconut smell. It was recommended to me by a veteran shaver and I\u2019m sold on Stephens and safety razor shaving.",
