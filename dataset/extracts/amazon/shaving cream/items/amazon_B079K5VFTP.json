                "reviewText": "I really like this moisturizer. My legs get incredibly dry throughout the year (more so in the winter) and sometimes I just don't want to put lotion on them. This is great for traveling because I can give my legs a quick spritz and the moisturizer works it's wonders. Before this, I used to scratch the skin right off my legs from the irritation. This brings it to a mild annoyance (which is HUGE) - even medical creams haven't provided such relief. I've made sure to always have an extra bottle handy and would recommend carrying this everywhere.",
