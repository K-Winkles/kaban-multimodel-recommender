I have a beard, so I don\u2019t use it to shave my whole face, but I do shave my cheeks, neck and back of my neck with just a tiny bit. This tube will last me almost a full year and provides the closest shave I\u2019ve ever had. My kids love the smell, as do I, and it keeps my skin soft. I also tend to gift it to close friends and family. To me, it is definitely worth the money\u2026 although I do miss their Lavender scented version.",

The smell is timeless. The only way I can describe it is \"old world classy\". There's a hint of Ivory soap scent, but with herbal and subtle spice notes. It's so well balanced as not to be overwhelming; just a lovely subtle scent. I don't know if it's the lanolin in it, but it always lathers up so nice and slick. My razor glides right over it. Very satisfying. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy a case!",
