                "reviewText": "I used Noxema shaving cream for sensitive skin for more than 25 years. After Unilever purchased Noxema, they decided to discontinue their line of canned shaving creams. Luckily I had a good supply of Noxema shaving cream, So I set out to find a comparable replacement. I looked and looked, for more than a year. After digging and digging, I discovered that a European company purchased the Noxema product recipes. The company, don't recall their name, had many other small companies listed under the parent company. One of those companies was Proraso. It appeared it was the only company that manufactured shaving cream. I then started researching Proraso shaving creams. It appeared that Proraso is one of the best shaving creams in Europe. I then discovered on multiple forums, that many people who had used Noxema were switching over to Proraso. Even though it was expensive, at least more expensive than the $3.00 bucks I had been paying for the Noxema product, I purchased a can as a sampler. It's the closest thing I've ever found to the old standby from Noxema. After using it for 2 years now, I'm sold. In fact, I even think it's better than the Noxema. Buy a can and decide for yourself. Awesome product, glad I found it.",
