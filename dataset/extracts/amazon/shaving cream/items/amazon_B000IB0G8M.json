                "reviewText": "So I'm kind of a veteran to double edged shaving. I've been improving my shave, ever since starting two years ago. Since then, I've tried a myriad of shaving creams, soaps, balms, toners, splashes, blades, and razors. Although I haven't had every single luxury cream on the market, believe me, I've had my share! I must say that Trumper's Coconut is in my top three rotation. On purpose, I skipped using any pre-shave oil for my first shave with this cream. I have sensitive skin, but, the first thing I noticed was how creamy the lather was after whipping up the cream with a 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Faux Petrified Wood Handle & Free Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor , and then shave with Merkur Progress Double Edge Safety Razor #500 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades , loaded with 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge . After three passes, a splash with cold water, then Thayer - Witch Hazel Toner Alcohol Free Lavender, 12 fl oz liquid , then applying Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Aftershave Lotion my skin was BUTTERY smooth! Again, I didn't even need a pre-shave oil. Since it came in a tube, I think I may use this as a travel cream, since I wouldn't need a pre-shave oil.Seriously, my razor and blade effortlessly plowed through my whiskers with this cream! And it lathered fairly well, although not as thick and fluffy as some Truefitt creams I've used. Maybe it's due to the coconut oil. I've tried most of the other two shaving creams of the three English T's (Truefitt & Hill, Taylors of Old Bond St.,) and this cream is one of the best you can try for sensitive skin. The coconut oil and acid contained in this product give you a soft, smooth complexion, provided you have the proper shaving technique down packed. I'm trying Castle & Forbes next but believe me, you will love this cream! It's not a strong coconut smell, and, it would also be great to use in humid or hot weather as you may be able to get away with using only a little aftershave balm or just an alcohol free toner afterwards. This cream, in my humble opinion, is part of the All Star team if there were one for creams. My current shave rotation consists of: Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort shave cream & Pre-Shave Oil/Ultimate Comfort balm, Truefitt & Hill 1805 shave cream and balm, Trumpers Coconut, Castle & Forbes lime shave cream and balm (<----just got in the mail today), Taylor's of Old Bond St. Avocado. If you're new to double edged wet shaving, picking up any of the above products should suit you well if you have sensitive skin like me.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second Geo F. Trumper shaving cream I have tried. I tried the Almond one first and this one is much thicker and has a very different feel. When I pull my razor away from my skin it often has a filmy string of product. Now that sounds gross but it goes to show just how gooey and gel like this can come across. That's neither a bad or good thing in my book. Where as Almond is very soothing, this one is moisturizing x2.It smells lightly of coconut and does not have a very overwhelming scent. I don't have feelings one way or the other when it comes to how fragrant something is, only whether or not I like the scent. Coconuts are always good in my book.My shaves were great and my husband like it too, though I think we lean a little more towards to Almond in terms of what we like. I was a pretty die hard Proraso fan but I'm more than happy to make the switch to this one.The only downsize is the size of this cream. With myself (lady shaver with a large area of real estate to cover) and my husband using this, it does not last long. I usually get more like 8-10oz for the same price with Proraso. Flip-side to the size, this is great for travel and gets through as a carry on item without a problem. Not everyone wants to spend $80+ a year on shaving cream, but this brands cream may just be worth it.",

Highly recommended.As a point of reference I've now tried Bigelow's Eucalyptus, AOS Unscented, TOBS Coconut, TOBS Sandalwood and various other cheaper options.PRICE: I was hesitant to make this price jump at first but 1) the quality is well worth the price and 2) a very little goes a long way, noticeably more so than the others mentioned above.SMELL: Note that this does NOT seem to be \"coconut scented.\" You can smell the coconut oil in it but it is by no means overpowering. The scent is very subtle but i very much like it. Of all those tried it's the only one I find myself opening to smell at times other than shaving time. It has an earthy, vaguely christmasy smell to it.LATHER: As noted above, a little bit lathers very well with a brush and mug. The lather is a little denser than TOBS and AOS but feels much less dry than those two after sitting on the face for a bit.PERFORMANCE: Again stellar. Especially noticeable on the third pass. On my first use I was pleasantly surprised with every stage, from first open to application, but truly wowed on the third pass. Additionally, it left a smooth shave and a moisturized face. I find I don't bother with a pre-shave oil nor use as much aftershave/moisturizer since using this regularly.",
