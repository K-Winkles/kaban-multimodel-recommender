                "reviewText": "I have recently used both the deluxe shave cream, and the clear shave gel, both from this Uppercut Deluxe brand. While they are both good products, they are quite different from each other, and I do have a definite preference between the two products, which I will explain\u2026 I do frequently shave with both types, specifically I shave with shaving creams that both do and do not not work best with use of a shaving brush, as well as shaving gels like this one.The shaving cream is mildly scented and has a traditional masculine scent which is mild, and somewhere between a barbershop scent and a medicinal shave cream scent. The scent is pleasant. It is not an overpowering scent. The shave cream applies easily, but not does not spread readily without use of a shave brush. With warm water and use of a good shaving brush, the cream does spread readily, but I still did not quite get as good of a lather as I prefer. The shave with this cream was fine, but the cream did not lubricate my shave as well as some creams do.In contrast, the clear shave gel is much easier to apply, it spreads more easily, and does not need the use of a shave brush. The shave gel is clear, as advertised, and is nearly colorless. It does have a light blue hue, but I do not appreciate any color once it is applied to the skin. This nearly invisible shave gel can be particularly useful when you want to see areas that you are shaving more clearly, particularly for any detail shaving. A downside of a completely clear gel is that it can make it more difficult to know where you have already shaved. When you apply a lather to your face, it is easy to see where you have shaved away the lather, but this gel does not provide that visual aid. But it is easy enough to shave in a pattern that allows you to know that you have covered all areas. This gel version provides better lubrication for the shave blade than the cream does. The scent is light and clean and masculine. Between the two, I have a definite preference for this clear shave gel, and that is despite my preference to have my shave cream/gel to have a little lather so that it is more clear where you have and have not yet shaved. The gel provides a very nice shaving experience, and while the shave cream is fine, I definitely prefer the shave gel, mostly because of how easy it is to apply and how well it lubricates the shave for a smoother shaving experience.. I hope some of this information is helpful for you.",

                "reviewText": "I tried this product along with two others from the same range (shave gel, exfoliating cleanser) and this one was my least favorite.To start, it didn\u2019t arrive particularly well-sealed. The container was wrapped in plastic, but the interior of the container only had a flimsy foam circle to contain the foam. It fell off when I unscrewed the cap to the container, and it was clear it had moved a lot in transit. There was some residue inside the container lid (pictured).The foam itself didn\u2019t create much of a lather when applied and I had to use quite a bit to cover my face. On the plus side, it did help me to have a smooth shave, although not as much as the shave gel.Lastly, I don\u2019t love the scent. It\u2019s sort of woodsy and earthy, but not fresh. I understand this comes down to personal taste for the most part, but it wasn\u2019t really what I\u2019d expect from a fresh, clean shave. It also smelled stronger with this product than the others.Given the price tag at the time of this review ($20), I expected more. Personally, I\u2019d skip this one and go with the shaving gel instead.",

                "reviewText": "After using a different shaving cream for years, I thought I'd try something new, so I bought Uppercut. That was a mistake.The main problem is that the Uppercut fails to lather. At all. I use a badger-hair brush and lather bowl. I continue to try the appropriate way to get a lather, and I get a slimy paste with any hint of lather. It's so bad I just ordered a new container of my previous shaving cream, which worked much better.",

                "reviewText": "The Deluxe Shave Cream is kind of a wet paste consistency. A little goes a long way, so I would start with a size that might cover a nickel and rub it in. It takes some getting used to - I tried an application of the paste consistency full strength and immediately shaved vs. adding a splatter of water and rubbing into a lather. I prefer the latter approach because it's an easier shave. The full paste approach without any dilution tends to feel more like I'm shaving through something similar to the consistency of a hand cream moisturizing lotion.I have a heavy beard and found that the closeness of the shave to be comparable to another popular brand of shaving lotion. I never experience any razor burn or nicks when using this cream and my skin does feel moisturized afterwards. Also, I find that this product may be best suited for travel instead of lugging along a larger and heavier can of shaving lotion.",
