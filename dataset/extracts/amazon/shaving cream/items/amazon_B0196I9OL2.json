I never cut myself shaving. I felt like I had to shave over and over at least 4 times just to get what one shave usually does. It seems to prevent a close shave so you have to press harder to make it work causing the cuts.I love Clubman and a classic manly scent. This product is terrible. Hand soap works 1,000x better. A $1 can of generic shaving cream is a much better.",
